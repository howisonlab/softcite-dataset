This scalar field leads to the theoretical existence of a further elementary massive quantum particle called the Higgs boson. In spite of efforts of past experiments at LEP and the T eVatron, the Higgs boson has not yet been observed [2], [3]. Several mass ranges have however been excluded at 95% Confidence Level, including Higgs mass regions below 114.4 GeV and from 141 to 476 GeV [4], [5].",

The corresponding production cross-sections as a function of mass are documented in Ref. [6]. The SM Higgs boson can decay to a multitude of final states, including a pair of bottom quarks, tau leptons or intermediate bosons, etc. Despite its small branching fraction of O(10 \u22123 ), the diphoton final state has the advantage of allowing the full reconstruction of the Higgs candidates mass while keeping the background to an acceptable level.",

Both converted and unconverted photons may enter the dataset. One event must have at least one primary vertex with 3 associated tracks, for which the individual transverse momentum p T is greater than 0.4 GeV. The photons, reconstructed from the electromagnetic clusters in the event, are required to be outside of a region |\u03b7| \u2208 [1.37, 1.52] which represents the transition region between the electromagnetic calorimeter's barrel and endcaps, and inside |\u03b7| < 2.37. The photon with the highest transverse momentum is called the leading photon, while the one with the second highest is called the subleading photon. The first is required to have a transverse momentum p lead \u03b3 T greater than 40 GeV while the second p sublead \u03b3 T has to be greater than 25 GeV. The photons are asked to be isolated. The isolation is computed from the energy contained in a (\u03b7, \u03c6) circle around the photon candidate, the core region of the electromagnetic cluster being excluded from the calculation. For each photon, it is required that E iso T < 5 GeV. Both photons are asked to pass tight selection criteria, which relie on shower shape variables and energy leakage inside the hadronic calorimeter. These identification criteria have an efficiency of about 80% for true photons. Finally, only the events with 100 < m \u03b3\u03b3 < 160 GeV enter the final dataset. Events passing this offline selection are selected by the trigger with an efficiency greater than 99%.",

The Drell-Yan background is estimated from Z \u2192 ee candidate events, by drawing the probability of misidentifying one of the two electrons as a photon. This probability is then multiplied to the Drell-Yan predicted yield to evaluate the corresponding background rate. In the diphoton mass range 100 to 160 GeV, the number of true diphoton events is found to be 3650 \u00b1 100 \u00b1 290, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
