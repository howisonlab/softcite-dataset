Recently, the doubly radiative decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 was studied in the frameworks of the Linear \u03c3 Model (L\u03c3M) and the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model [7,8]. It has been demonstrated that the contributions from the VMD are dominant. Experimentally, only an upper limit of the non-resonant branching fraction of B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) NR < 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at the 90% confidence level has been determined by the GAMS-2000 experiment [9].",

The inclusive decay is defined as the \u03b7 \u2032 decay into the final state \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 including all possible intermediate contributions from the \u03c1\u2212 and \u03c9\u2212mesons below the \u03b7 \u2032 mass threshold and the non-resonant contribution from the excited vector meson above the \u03b7 \u2032 mass threshold. Since the contribution from mesons above the \u03b7 \u2032 threshold actually derives from the low-mass tail and looks like a contact term, we call this contribution 'non-resonant'. The branching fraction for the non-resonant \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 decay is obtained from a fit to the \u03b3\u03c0 0 invariant mass distribution by excluding the coherent contributions from the \u03c1 and \u03c9 intermediate states. The measurement of the M 2 \u03b3\u03b3 dependent partial widths will provide direct inputs to the theoretical calculations on the transition form factors of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 and improve the theoretical understanding of the \u03b7 \u2032 decay mechanisms.",

The masses and widths of the \u03c1 and \u03c9 meson are fixed to their PDG values [16]. B 2 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c9/\u03c1) is the Blatt-Weisskopf centrifugal barrier factor for the \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c9/\u03c1) decay vertex with radius R = 0.75 fm [19,20], and B 2 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c9/\u03c1) is used to damp the divergent tail due to the factor E 3 \u03b3 \u03b7 \u2032 (\u03c9/\u03c1) . The Gaussian function G(0, \u03c3) is used to parameterize the detector resolution. The combinatorial background is produced by the combination of the \u03c0 0 and the photon from the \u03b7 \u2032 meson, and its PDF is described with a fixed shape from the MC simulation. The ratio of yields between the combinatorial backgrounds and the coherent sum of \u03c1-\u03c9 signals is fixed from the MC simulations. The shape of the non-resonant signal \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 is determined from the MC simulation, and its yield is determined in the fit. The background from the Class I as discussed above is fixed to the shape and yield of the MC simulation. Finally, the shape from the Class II background is obtained from the \u03b7 \u2032 mass sidebands (738 \u2212 788 and 1008 \u2212 1058 MeV/c 2 ), and its normalization is fixed in the fit. The M \u03b3\u03c0 0 mass range used in the fit is 0.20\u22120.92 GeV/c 2 . In the fit, the interference phase \u03b8 between the \u03c1-and \u03c9-components is allowed. Due to the low statistics of the \u03c1 meson contribution, we fix the ratio \u03b1 of \u03c1 and \u03c9 intensities to the value for the ratio of B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1) \u2022 B(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) and B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9) \u2022 B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) from the PDG [16].

The branching fraction of the inclusive decay is measured for the first time to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) Incl. = (3.20\u00b10.07(stat)\u00b10.23(sys))\u00d710 \u22123 . The M 2 \u03b3\u03b3 dependent partial decay widths are also determined. In addition, the branching fraction for the non-resonant decay is determined to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) NR = (6.16 \u00b1 0.64(stat) \u00b1 0.67(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which agrees with the upper limit measured by the GAMS-2000 experiment [9]. As a validation of the fit, the product branching fraction with the omega intermediate state involved is obtained to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9) \u2022 B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) = (2.37 \u00b1 0.14(stat) \u00b1 0.18(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , which is consistent with the PDG value [16]. These results are useful to test QCD calculations on the transition form factor, and provide valuable inputs to the theoretical understanding of the light meson decay mechanisms.",
