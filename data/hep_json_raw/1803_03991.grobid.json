In addition to physics beyond the standard model, a good understanding of tt production is necessary JHEP06 (2018)002for measurements of rare standard model processes, such as tt production in association with a W, Z, or Higgs boson.",

In the first, mg5 amc@nlo is used to generate events at leading-order (LO) accuracy with up to three additional partons, and pythia is employed with the CUETP8M1 tune [23] for parton showering and hadronization. The MLM jet-parton matching algorithm [24] is used in this sample, referred to as mg5 amc@nlo-lo. In the second, mg5 amc@nlo simulates events to NLO accuracy with up to two additional partons, where parton showering and hadronization are performed using pythia with the CUETP8M2T4 tune. The FxFx jet-parton matching algorithm [25] is used, and this sample is referred to as mg5 amc@nlo-nlo. It is important to compare multiple tt generators in order to find the current most suitable description of top quark production and decay, and to identify any discrepancies in the models. In all simulated tt samples, the top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The NNPDF30 nlo as 0118 parton distribution function (PDF) set is used for the NLO samples while the NNPDF30 lo as 0130 set is used for the LO samples [26]. When comparing with reconstructed data, a cross section of 832 +20 \u221229 (scale) \u00b1 35 (PDF + \u03b1 S ) pb is used to normalize the tt samples, where \u03b1 S is the strong coupling constant. This tt cross section is calculated to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic soft-gluon terms with Top++ (v2.0) [27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. The scale uncertainty in this tt cross section comes from the independent variation of the factorization and renormalization scales.",

Separate samples are generated for t-and s-channel production [36,37]. The sample of single top quarks in association with a W boson is produced with powheg (v1) [38]. In this sample, the diagram removal scheme [39] is used to avoid double counting of Feynman diagrams in the production of single top quarks in association with a W boson at NLO and top quark pair production. Samples of W and Z boson production with leptonic final states, in association with jets (V+jets), are generated with mg5 amc@nlo-lo. Separate samples are generated with exactly one, two, three, and four additional jets to ensure a large sample of events that are likely to mimic the signature of tt production.

The distributions of these variables measured in data are shown in figures 1 and 2, and are compared to the sum of signal and background events from simulation. A total of 662 381 events are measured in data, of which 92.1% are predicted from the powheg+pythia simulation to be tt events. Single top quark production and V+jets production contribute 4.4% and 2.1% to the total number of events, respectively, as estimated from simulation. The component of multijet QCD events is estimated from control regions in the data, and comprises approximately 1.4% of the total number of events. The control regions are designed to obtain data samples that are enriched in QCD multijet events that are kinematically similar to the signal region, but with little contamination from tt, single top quark, and V+jets events. In the e+jets channel, the control region is obtained by inverting the isolation criterion on electron candidates. In the \u00b5+jets channel, the control region is obtained by requiring muon candidates to satisfy 0.15 < I rel < 0.30. In the control regions for both channels, the number of b-tagged jets is also required to be exactly zero. The contribution of tt, single top quark and V+jets events to the control JHEP06(2018)002 regions (\u224815-20%) is estimated from simulation with all corrections and subtracted from the data. The ratio of the number of multijet QCD events in the control region to that in the signal region (the transfer factor), both predicted from simulation, is then used to scale the normalization of the data control region to obtain the multijet QCD estimate in the signal region. Other sources of background are negligible, and are not considered in this measurement. The level of agreement between the total event count of data and simulation, within 0.2% , indicates that the total cross section is compatible to that stated in section 3.",

The b hadrons can then be clustered into jets without affecting the kinematic properties of the jet. A jet with a b hadron among its constituents is considered to have originated from a b quark. The particle-level p miss T is calculated from all stable visible particles. The differential tt production cross sections are measured in a visible phase space, which is chosen to be the same for both e+jets and \u00b5+jets channels, and to closely resemble the criteria used to select events in data. Particle-level objects are used to define the common visible phase space of tt events for both e+jets and \u00b5+jets channels, all within |\u03b7| < 2.4, which requires exactly one electron or muon with p T > 26 GeV, and no additional electrons or muons with p T > 15 GeV.
