Wide physics program of the experiment comprises study of hadron structure and spectroscopy with high energy muon and hadrons beams. As for the muon-program, one of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment is the exploration of the transverse spin structure of the nucleon via spin (in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries in single-hadron production in deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons off transversely polarized target. For this purpose a series of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and transversely polarized 6 LiD (in 2002,  2003 and 2004)  and NH 3 (in 2007 and 2010) targets. The experimental results obtained by COMPASS for unpolarized target azimuthal asymmetries, Sivers and Collins effects and other azimuthal observables play an important role in the general understanding of the three-dimensional nature of the nucleon. Giving access to the entire twsit-2 set of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions COMPASS data triggers constant theoretical interest and is being widely used in phenomenological analyses and global data fits. In this review main focus is given to the very recent results obtained by the COMPASS collaboration from first ever multidimensional extraction of transverse spin asymmetries.",

Corresponding structure functions contain terms at sub-leading order in Q \u22121 which involve a mixture of twist-two and induced by quark-gluon correlations twist-three parton distribution and fragmentation functions. 2,15,16 However, applying wildly adopted so-called \"Wandzura-Wilczek approximation\" this higher twist objects can be simplified to twist-two level (see Refs. 2, 4 for more details). In general, TSAs being convolutions of different TMD functions are known to be complex objects a priori dependent on the choice of kinematical ranges and multidimensional kinematical phase-space. Thus, ideally, asymmetries have to be extracted as multi-differential functions of kinematical variables in order to reveal the most complete multivariate dependence. In practice, available statistics often is too limited for such an ambitious approach and investigating dependence of the asymmetries on some specific kinematic variable one is forced to integrate over all the others. Presently, one of the hottest topics in the field of spin-physics is the study of TMD evolution of various PDFs and FFs and related asymmetries. Different models predict from small up to quite large \u223c 1/Q 2 suppression of the QCD-evolution effects attempting to describe available experimental observations and make predictions for the future ones. [17][18][19] Additional experimental measurements exploring different Q 2 domains for fixed x-range are necessary to further constrain the theoretical models. The work described in this review is a unique and first ever attempt to explore behaviour of TSAs in the multivariate kinematical environment. For this purpose COMPASS experimental data was split into five different Q 2 ranges giving an opportunity to study asymmetries as a function of Q 2 at fixed bins of x. Additional variation of z and p T cuts allows to deeper explore multi-dimensional behaviour of the TSAs and their TMD constituents.",

Selected five Q 2 -ranges are the following ones: [1.7; 3], [3; 7], [7; 16], [16; 81] a . In addition, each of this samples has been divided into five z and five p T (GeV/c) sub-ranges defined as follows:  Another approach was used to focus on zand p T -dependences in different xranges. For this study the two-dimensional z:p T phase-space has been divided into 7 \u00d7 6 grid as it is demonstrated in left plot in Fig. 1. Selecting in addition three x-bins: 0.003 < x < 0.7, 0.003 < x < 0.032, 0.032 < x < 0.7 asymmetries have been extracted in \"3D: x-z-p T \" grid. In the next section several examples of COMPASS preliminary results obtained for multi-dimensional target transverse spin dependent azimuthal asymmetries are presented.",

Sizable Sivers asymmetry is observed for positive hadrons tending to increase with p T , while for negative hadrons there are some indications for a positive signal at relatively large x and Q 2 . The bottom plot draws the Q 2 dependence in a \"3D: x-z-Q 2 \" configuration and serves as a direct input for TMDevolution related studies.

Various multi-differential configurations has been tested exploring x:Q 2 :z:p T phase-space. Particular attention was given to probes of possible Q 2 -dependence of TSAs, serving a direct input to TMD-evolution related studies. Several interesting observations have been made studying the results obtained for Sivers, Collins, A asymmetries. Other four asymmetries were found to be compatible with zero within given statistical accuracy. These results combined with past and future data of other collaborations will give a unique opportunity to access the whole set of TMD PDFs and test their multi-differential nature and key features.",
