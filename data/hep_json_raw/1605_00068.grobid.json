Combining the Particle Data Group values of B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ), B(D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e ), and the lifetimes of the D 0 and D + mesons with the value of B(D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) measured in this work, we determine the following ratios of partial widths: (D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc )/ (D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) = 0.963 \u00b1 0.044 and (D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc )/ (D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e ) = 0.988 \u00b1 0.033.",

Using the branching fractions and the lifetimes of the D 0 and D + mesons (\u03c4 D 0 , \u03c4 D + ), taken from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [2], we obtain (D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc )/ (D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) = 0.91 \u00b1 0.07 and (D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc )/ (D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e ) = 1.04 \u00b1 0.07, where the uncertainties are dominated by B(D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) [2]. Thus, an improved measurement of B(D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) will be helpful to understand D decay mechanisms with better accuracy. In addition, the improved B(D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) can also be used to precisely determine the form factor f K + (0) and the quark mixing matrix element |V cs | from D semileptonic decays [3].",

A 43-layer main drift chamber (MDC) surrounding the beam pipe performs precise determinations of charged particle trajectories and provides a measurement of the specific ionization energy loss (d E/dx) that is used for charged particle identification (PID). An array of time-of-flight counters (TOF) is located radially outside the MDC and provides additional PID information. A CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) surrounds the TOF and is used to measure the energies of photons and electrons. A solenoidal superconducting magnet located outside the EMC provides a 1 T magnetic field in the central tracking region of the detector. The iron flux return of the magnet is instrumented with about 1272 m 2 of resistive plate muon counters (MUC) arranged in nine layers in the barrel and eight layers in the endcaps that are used to identify muons with momentum greater than 0.5 GeV/c. More details about the BESIII detector are described in Ref. [9].",

The maximum changes of the branching fractions, which are 0.3 and 0.3 % for E and M BC requirements, are assigned as the uncertainties, respectively. The uncertainties in the tracking and PID for \u03bc + are estimated by analyzing e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events. The differences of the two-dimensional (momentum and cos \u03b8 ) weighted tracking efficiencies of data and MC are determined to be (+0.2\u00b10.5) % and (\u22121.5\u00b10.5) %, respectively. We assign 0.5 and 0.5 % as the systematic uncertainties in the tracking and PID for \u03bc + after correcting for these differences, respectively. Due to different topologies, there may be difference between the weighted efficiencies for the muons in D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . This difference, which is estimated to be 0.5 % by analyzing the two kinds of signal MC events, is considered as a systematic uncertainty. By examining the doubly tagged hadronic DD decays, we find that the difference of the acceptance efficiencies with E extra \u03b3 max < 0.15 GeV of data and MC is (+3.6 \u00b1 0.1) %. So, we assign 0.1 % as the uncertainty in the E extra \u03b3 max requirement after correcting the MC efficiency to data. The uncertainty in the MK 0 \u03bc + requirement is estimated to be 0.8 % by comparing the branching fractions measured with alternative requirements of MK 0 \u03bc + < 1.55 and 1.65 GeV/c 2 with the nominal value. The uncertainty in the U miss fit is estimated to be 0.8 % by comparing the branching fractions measured using different signal shape, background shape and fit range with the nominal value. Here, to examine the uncertainty in the background shape, we vary the relative strengths of each of the components in the inclusive MC sample and shift the estimated numbers of other peaking backgrounds by 1\u03c3 . In our previous work, the uncertainty in the signal MC generator is estimated to be 0.1 %, which is obtained by comparing the DT efficiencies before and after re-weighting the q 2 = ( p D \u2212 p K ) 2 distribution of the signal MC events of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e to data [23], where the p D and p K are the momenta of D and K mesons.

            "text": "For the measurement withK 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , the independent systematic uncertainty arises from the uncertainties in the \u03c0 0 selection, theK 0 mass window, the MC statistics (0.5 %), B(K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) (0.2 %) [2] and the \u03c7 2 1 + \u03c7 2 2 selection method. The \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is verified by analyzing the hadronic decays D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 versusD 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 0 . The difference of the \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiencies of data and MC is found to be (\u22121.1\u00b11.0) % per \u03c0 0 . After correcting the detection efficiency of the signal side for this difference, the systematic uncertainty in \u03c0 0 reconstruction is taken as 1.0 % per \u03c0 0 . Here, the photons from theK 0 \u2192 K 0 S (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) decays are reconstructed under an assumption that the K 0 S meson decayed at the IP. We investigate the DT efficiencies of two kinds of signal MC events, in which the lifetimes of K 0 S meson from the signal side are set at the nominal value and 0, respectively. Their difference is less than 0.2 %, which is considered as the systematic uncertainty of the K 0 S (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) reconstruction. To avoid the effect of the D + \u2192K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 peaking backgrounds, the uncertainty in theK 0 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) mass window is estimated by examining the B(D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e ) using the sameK 0 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) selection criteria. We compare the branching fractions measured using alternativeK 0 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) mass windows (0.460, 0.505), (0.470, 0.500), (0.480, 0.500) GeV/c 2 with the nominal value. The maximum change of the re-measured branching fractions 0.9 % is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty in the \u03c7 2 1 + \u03c7 2 2 selection method is estimated to be 0.3 %, which is the difference of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 acceptance efficiencies of the hadronic decays of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 versusD 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 between data and MC. Adding these in quadrature, we obtain the total independent systematic uncertainty (\u03b4 com sys ) forK 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mode to be 2.3 %. Table 2 summarizes the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of B(D + \u2192K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ). Quadratically combining the independent uncertainties for +\u2212 and 00 modes after considering their observed DT yields as weights, we obtain the independent uncertainty to be 1.4 %. Adding the common and independent uncertainties in quadrature yields the total systematic uncertainty 2.1 %. Table 2 Systematic uncertainties (%) in the measurement of B(D + \u2192 K 0 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ). \u03b4 com sys and \u03b4 ind sys denote the common and independent systematic uncertainties for +\u2212 and 00 modes ",
