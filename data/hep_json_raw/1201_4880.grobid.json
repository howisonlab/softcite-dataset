The analyzed data sample was recorded by the CDFII detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 6.0 fb \u22121 . The search is performed in the final state with one \u03c4 decaying leptonically and the second one identified through its semi-hadronic decay. Since no significant excess is observed, a 95% credibility level upper limit on the production cross section times branching ratio to the \u03c4 \u03c4 final state is set for hypothetical Higgs boson masses between 100 and 150 GeV/c 2 . For a Higgs boson of 120 GeV/c 2 the observed (expected) limit is 14.6 (15.3) the predicted value.",

In the SM, EWSB requires the existence of a yet unobserved scalar particle, the Higgs boson [1][2][3]. Direct searches at LEP [4], combined with the recent exclusion mass ranges provided by the Tevatron [5] and LHC experiments [6], have reduced the possible values for the mass of the SM Higgs boson. The Higgs mass is now excluded at 95% confidence level (C.L.) below 114 GeV/c 2 and between 141 and 476 GeV/c 2 . A global fit to electroweak measurements [7] provides indirect indications that confirm the region below 158 GeV/c 2 as the most probable. Therefore the searches in the low mass decay channels play a crucial role to set a final statement on the SM Higgs boson existence.",

In the MSSM scenario, the latest results have been published by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [10,11]. This Letter presents results of a search for the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays in the final state with two \u03c4 leptons and one or more jets, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected at the Tevatron by the CDFII detector at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The search is sensitive to contributions of several Higgs boson production mechanisms: gluon-gluon fusion gg \u2192 H, associated production with the W or Z boson (VH), and the vector boson fusion (VBF) qHq \u2032 \u2192 q\u03c4 \u03c4 q \u2032 . To improve the search sensitivity a novel strategy for the \u03c4 identification is proposed, based on a multivariate technique [12]. Tau leptons are short-lived particles (\u03c4 = 290.6 \u00d7 10 \u221215 s [13]), which can be detected only through their decay products. Semi-hadronic decays \u03c4 \u2192 X h \u03bd \u03c4 , where X h is a system of hadrons and \u03bd \u03c4 is the \u03c4 neutrino, are denoted in this paper as \u03c4 h and correspond to a B.R. of about 65%.

Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia, accounting for the remaining 35%, the final states \u03c4 h \u03c4 l , studied in this paper include about 46% of all possible decays of \u03c4 pairs. CDFII [14][15][16] is an azimuthally and forward-backward symmetric general-purpose particle detector. The geometry is described using the azimuthal angle \u03d5 and the pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8 2), where \u03b8 is the polar angle measured with respect to the proton beam axis z. A charged-particle tracking system, immersed in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field, consists of an inner set of silicon micro-strip detectors ( \u03b7 < 2), and a open-cell drift chamber ( \u03b7 < 1). Electromagnetic and hadronic sampling calorimeters surround the tracking system and cover central ( \u03b7 < 1.1) and forward (1.1 < \u03b7 < 3.6) regions. Proportional chambers and scintillating strip detectors, embedded in the electromagnetic section of the central and forward calorimeters correspondingly, measure positions and transverse profiles of the showers. Dedicated muon detectors located outside the calorimeter provide coverage for \u03b7 < 1.5. Gas Cherenkov counters, installed in the forward region 3.7 < \u03b7 < 4.7, measure the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing, providing a measurement of the instantaneous luminosity. The components of energy and momenta in the plane transverse to the beam are defined as E T = E sin \u03b8 and p T = p sin \u03b8. Since neutrinos do not interact with the detector components, their E T must be inferred from the energy imbalance in the transverse plane, E / T [17].",

A \u03c4 h candidate is required to have a good quality track with p T > 6 GeV/c, pointing to a calorimeter clus-ter with E T > 9 GeV and \u03b7 < 1.0. Momenta of the charged and neutral particles reconstructed around the highest p T track in the cluster (referred to as the seed track [20]), define the ''visible'' four-momentum of the \u03c4 h candidate, \u20d7 p vis . The transverse component of \u20d7 p vis , or visible p T , is required to be greater than 15 GeV/c. Momenta of the neutral pions and photons are reconstructed using the central shower maximum detector. To be consistent with the topology of the hadronic \u03c4 decay, the number of tracks associated with the \u03c4 h candidate is required to be 1 or 3. Tau decay modes with higher charged track multiplicity, contributing of the order of 1%, are not considered. Contamination from electrons and muons mimicking the \u03c4 h signature is reduced by rejecting candidates with E had P < 0.2, where E had is the hadronic part of the \u03c4 h cluster energy, and P is the scalar sum of all track momenta associated with the \u03c4 h candidate. To discriminate between taus and jets originating from quarks or gluons (referred to as QCD jets), the reconstructed \u03c4 h candidates are required to be isolated. This is achieved by demanding that no charged or neutral particles are reconstructed in the isolation annulus [20] defined around the seed track, or by requiring the sum of their measured p T to be below a given threshold. In this search, the discrimination between \u03c4 h 's and QCD jets is further enhanced by using a multivariate selection based on a set of Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) [21,22]. Several \u03c4 h categories are defined according to the number of tracks and to the visible p T of the \u03c4 h candidate, and specific BDTs are implemented for each category. The input variables which provide the largest discrimination power are the \u03c4 h visible mass, M vis = p 2 vis , and the number of charged and neutral particles reconstructed in the isolation annulus, as well as the sum of their p T . Compared to the cut-based \u03c4 h selection [23], the BDT-based selection reduces the jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification rate by 25% while maintaining the same identification efficiency, at a level of 35% for p T > 30 GeV/c.",

The detector response is simulated with a geant3-based package [24]. Higgs, tt and diboson production processes are generated by pythia [25] with the CTEQ5L set of parton distribution functions (PDF's) [26] and their contributions normalized to the next-to-leading order (NLO) theoretical cross sections [27][28][29][30][31]. The Z+jets background is generated using alpgen [32], matched with pythia for the hadronization and parton showering. Relative contributions of the different Z+n partons subprocesses are provided by alpgen, with the total event yield normalized to the measured Z \u2192 ll production cross section [33]. Additional correction factors, determined by comparing data and simulations in specific control samples, are applied to account for the observed mis-modeling of the e \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification probabilities. Background contributions resulting from lepton misidentification are estimated using a data-based method. In \u03b3+jet and QCD multijet events no significant correlation is expected between the charges of the two reconstructed lepton candidates, thus leading to an equal amount of opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) events with similar kinematic features. The \u03b3+jet and QCD multijet contributions in the OS event selection are then modeled using the SS data sample. In case of the W +jets process there is a correlation between the charge of the lepton produced in the W boson decay and the charge of the outgoing quark which generates the jet misidentified as the \u03c4 h ; this results in an excess of OS events. This OS/SS asymmetry, A = 2.2 \u00b1 0.5, is measured in a W +jets enriched control sample obtained by loosening the \u03c4 h selection and by applying a cut on E / T > 20/30/35 GeV (for events with N (jets) = 0, 1 or \u2265 2, respectively) and on the reconstructed W transverse mass, M T > 40 GeV/c [34].",

Events with N (jets) = 0 are used to validate the background model. The \u03c4 h identification efficiency, \u01eb, is measured in a high purity Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 sample, defined by events with N (jets) = 0, E / T > 10 GeV and M T < 60 GeV/c 2 . The ratio of the \u01eb measurements in the data and MC, SF \u03c4 = 0.96 \u00b1 0.05, is used to correct the acceptance. Expected signal and background yields and the observed data in the N (jets) = 1 and N (jets) \u2265 2 channels are summarized in Table I. Figure 1 shows the invariant mass of the two most energetic jets in the N (jets) \u2265 2 channel; since the hadronic decay of the W or Z boson is reconstructed, this variable is one of the most powerful in discriminating the associated Higgs boson production signal from the largest backgrounds. Several sources of systematic uncertainties affect both the signal and background estimates. The largest one is the uncertainty on the jet energy scale [19], which leads to acceptance variations up to a 20% level in different jet multiplicity channels. Non-negligible effects on the shapes of different jet-related kinematic distributions are also observed and taken into account. Another relevant source of systematic uncertainty which affects the sample normalizations is the theoretical and experimental uncertainty on the cross sections: uncertainties on diboson and tt production are 6% and 10% respectively [27][28][29], while for Drell-Yan processes we take a value of 2.2% [33]. The gg \u2192 H production depends strongly on the gluon parton density function and the accompanying value of \u03b1 s (q 2 ). The theoretical uncertainty on the cross section of this process, calculated separately for different jet multiplicity channels, results in uncertainties of 23.5% and 67.5% on the expected yield of the signal events with N (jets) = 1 and N (jets) \u2265 2, respectively [30]. The cross section uncertainties for the other Higgs boson production mechanisms are 10% for VBF and 5% for VH [27,31]. The uncertainties on the \u03c4 h identification efficiency and on the e \u2192 \u03c4 h and \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification probabilities, are 5%, 7%, and 15% respectively. Systematic uncertainties due to the modeling of the initial state (ISR) and final state radiation (FSR) have been evaluated for all the Higgs boson production processes: the largest variation, 15%, corresponds to the gluon fusion process. The choice of the PDFs affects the acceptance at the level of a few percent, while an uncertainty of 2.3% on the inclusive Drell-Yan acceptance is derived from the differences between the observed alpgen and pythia-based calculations. A 10% uncertainty on the contribution of events with jets misidentified as \u03c4 h is estimated from SS data. The uncertainty of the W +jets background is estimated, using OS/SS asymmetry, at 25% (30%) for W + 1 (\u2265 2) jet channel.",

            "text": "After all selection cuts are applied, the background expectation is still significantly larger than the expected Higgs boson signal. The dominant irreducible background contribution, Z\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , is topologically very similar to the signal, thus affecting the sensitivity of the search; in addition, the Higgs boson invariant mass reconstructed from the visible decay products of the two \u03c4 leptons suffers from a very poor resolution, given that a sizeable fraction of the \u03c4 energy is carried by the undetected neutrinos. Since no other single powerful variable is available, a multivariate approach is followed and the discriminating power of various kinematic and topological observables is combined into one single output discriminant. The search strategy is based on two sequential BDT-based selections applied to the candidate events. The first set of BDTs is trained to discriminate H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 from W +jets, QCD, Z \u2192 ee \u00b5\u00b5 and tt backgrounds. At this step an event is accepted if its BDT score is higher than an optimal value, estimated by maximizing the search sensitivity. The second set of BDTs is trained to discriminate the signal against Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 . The choice and the number of input variables is optimized for each BDT, considering the most discriminating among a set of 23 well-modeled kinematic quantities. The training procedure is performed separately for the N (jets) = 1 and N (jets) \u2265 2 channels and optimized for two different Higgs boson mass scenarios (M H = 120 GeV/c 2 and M H = 140 GeV/c 2 ). Results are shown in Fig. 2 for a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV/c 2 . After the cuts applied on the set of BDT scores, the expected (observed) event yield is 1052 \u00b1 83 (1063) and 288 \u00b1 28 (310) in the N (jets) = 1 and N (jets) \u2265 2 channels, respectively. The corresponding expected Higgs signal is 1.68 \u00b1 0.35 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.26.",
