In the domain of high energy physics it was used to produce the tagged photon beam to study photoproduction (see for example [1]). At HERA, the lepton induced process, e + p \u2192 e + p + \u03b3 , was not only used to determine the machine absolute and instantaneous luminosities but also served as an efficient beam diagnostic and monitoring tool (see for example [2,3]). The measurements exploited basic properties of the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung final state: an approximate energy conservation as well as the angular properties of radiated photons. Feynman diagram of this process is shown in Fig. 1a.",

They concluded that these processes do not play a very important role and can be safely neglected at high energies. The values of the parameters in their model are subject to experimental verification. In particular, the model uses the Donnachie-Landshoff parameterisation [8] with linear pomeron trajectory \u03b1(t) = 1.0808 + 0.25 \u2022 t. The elastic scattering slope evolution is described by B(s) = B N N IP + 2 \u2022 \u03b1 IP ln s/s 0 where s 0 = 1 GeV 2 and B N N IP = 9 GeV \u22122 . For a full account of the model details and its parameters a reader is referred to original publications. It is worth mentioning that in this model the absorptive are effectively taken into account and therefore there is no need to apply the gap survival probability factor.",

The spatial resolution of the scattered proton trajectory measurement in the main detector is about 30 \u00b5m. The overlap detectors consist of horizontal fibers are dedicated to the measurement of the distance between the upper and bottom main detectors. In the following, the distance between the edge of the active part of the main detector and the outer wall (beam side) of the roman pot was assumed to be 0.5 mm. The energy of the scattered proton registered by the ALFA stations can be determined with resolution of about 40 GeV [15].",

In addition, the scattered proton angular distribution is very narrow due to the large value of the nuclear slope parameter at high energies and its average value is \u223c1/(4\u03b3 ) at the LHC energies. The process cross-section is of the order of a few microbarns at the LHC energies. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the polar angle of the bremsstrahlung photon. The mean value of the photon emission angle is close to 150 \u00b5rad. In Fig. 4 the distributions of the four-momentum transfer squared, t, of the radiating (or \"signal\") proton (left) and that of the elastic one (right) are shown. These distributions well match the t-range accepted by the ALFA detectors [9,17]. The photon energy spectrum (not shown) is of a typical \u223c 1/E \u03b3 shape and that of the proton relative energy loss is proportional to 1/\u03be . The final state particles are emitted in the forward directions. For the LHC running with \u03b2 = 90 m both final state protons can be registered with the help of the ALFA stations. Therefore, the signal signature is defined as the three-particle final state with the photon registered in the ZDC and the scattered protons in the ALFA stations. One should note that the presently assumed signal signature differs significantly from that discussed in [13] where the diffractive bremsstrahlung observation was based on the registration of a photon in the ZDC and a single proton in the AFP detectors located in the same hemisphere of the reaction.",

Imposing such a cut leads to the visible cross-sections of 1.16 and 12.8 \u00b5b for the signal and the background, respectively. This corresponds to the signal to background ratio of about 1/10. It is worth stressing that such a low value is obtained without any requirement on the event exclusivity, in particular without exploiting the four-momentum conser- Fig. 7 The distribution of the probability that the distance, R \u03b3 , between the reconstructed photon impact point at the ZDC and the beam projection is smaller than a certain value. The red line the signal event sample, the blue line the background sample vation. On the other hand one should observe that the use of the energy and momentum conservation allows a further optimisation of the background reduction which can be performed in the following way. This procedure makes use of the properties of the final state particles produced in diffractive bremsstrahlung process. Namely, the proton scattered into the hemisphere opposite to the \"signal\" one, to a very good approximation, preserves the energy of the beam i.e. has properties resembling a proton scattered in elastic process. Therefore, its transport through the structures of the LHC can be computed using the machine optics (transport matrices) designed for the measurement of the elastic pp scattering. This also means that the backward transport -from the ALFA station to the ATLAS IP -can be calculated in a simple manner. This allows a full determination of the elastic proton transverse momentum at the IP using its trajectory position measured by the ALFA detectors. In addition, reconstruction of the bremsstrahlung photon impact point on the ZDC face and the measurement of its energy delivers full information on the measured momentum of the photon. Assuming that there is a three-particle final state in the event and applying Eq. (2), the four-momentum vector of a pseudo-proton (pseudo-p 1 particle) can be constructed. 5 One should anticipate that the energy and momentum distributions of such a pseudo-particle can, in principle, be different for the signal and background samples as a consequence of the presence in the background events of additional final state particles escaping the detector acceptance. In the next step its position at the ALFA stations is calculated using the transport parametrisation and next the distance, R p , between its impact point and that of the signal proton is determined. It should be noted that in bremsstrahlung events the pseudo-p 1 particle four-momentum should be very close to that of the genuine Fig. 8 The distribution of the probability that the distance, R p , between the p 1 proton and pseudop 1 positions in the ALFA detector (see text). The red line the signal event sample, the blue line the background sample signal proton. Possible difference is a result of various resolutions. On the other hand in the case of a background event the differences are expected to be large so are the R p values. This is a consequence of the lack of the momentum conservation for background events. One expects that the background events contain more than three final state particles. These additional ones have to escape the detectors' acceptance (so the event passes the selection criteria) introducing the missing momentum in the event and hence large smearing of the pseudo-proton momentum and large R p values. One should note that this is so also true for exclusive pp \u2192 pp + \u03c0 0 events since the selection requires a single photon in the ZDC, i.e. a part of the \u03c0 0 momentum is not measured.",
