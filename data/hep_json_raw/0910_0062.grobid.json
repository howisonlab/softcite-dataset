            "text": "We present a study of exclusive neutral pion production in neutrino-nucleus Neutral Current interactions using data from the NOMAD experiment at the CERN SPS. The data correspond to 1.44 \u00d7 10 6 muonneutrino Charged Current interactions in the energy range 2.5 E \u03bd 300 GeV. Neutrino events with only one visible \u03c0 0 in the final state are expected to result from two Neutral Current processes: coherent \u03c0 0 production, \u03bd + A \u2192 \u03bd + A + \u03c0 0 and single \u03c0 0 production in neutrino-nucleon scattering. The signature of coherent \u03c0 0 production is an emergent \u03c0 0 almost collinear with the incident neutrino while \u03c0 0 's produced in neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering have larger transverse momenta. In this analysis all relevant backgrounds to the coherent \u03c0 0 production signal are measured using data themselves. Having determined the backgrounds, and using the Rein-Sehgal model for the coherent \u03c0 0 production to compute the detection efficiency, we obtain 4630 \u00b1 522(stat) \u00b1 426(syst) corrected coherent-\u03c0 0 events with E \u03c0 0 0.5 GeV. We measure \u03c3 (\u03bdA \u2192 \u03bdA\u03c0 0 ) = [72.6 \u00b1 8.1(stat) \u00b1 6.9(syst)] \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 /nucleus. This is the most precise measurement of the coherent \u03c0 0 production to date.",

            "text": "Consequently the past cross-section measurements of Coh \u03c0 0 have been poor, with a precision no better than 30% [2][3][4][5][6]; recently the MiniBOONE experiment has reported the fraction of Coh \u03c0 0 in all exclusive NC \u03c0 0 production [7]. This challenge is the primary motivation for the present analysis. The second motivation is utilitarian. Since Coh \u03c0 0 is almost collinear with the incident neutrino, in massive neutrino detectors a Coh \u03c0 0 event will manifest itself as a forward electromagnetic shower posing a background for the \u03bd e -induced signal. This is relevant to the long baseline experiments searching for \u03bd e appearance with the purpose of measuring the mixing angle \u0398 13 . A precise measurement of Coh \u03c0 0 , although conducted at energies higher than those of the long baseline projects at Fermilab (MINOS/NO\u03bdA), will constrain the error on a model-prediction of this background to the \u03bd e appearance. Finally, the study of coherent pion production provides an insight into the structure of the weak hadronic current [1,8], and offers a test of the partially conserved axial-vector current hypothesis (PCAC) [9]. Ref. [10] presents an excellent review of these topics. A coherent interaction, Fig. 1, where no charge or isospin is exchanged between the \u03bd and the target nucleus (A) which recoils without breakup, leads to an enhancement in the cross-section. In the Coh \u03c0 0 process the interaction is mediated by a pomeron-like particle bearing the quantum number of the vacuum. The crosssection is dominated by the axial vector current. The contribution of the isovector current to the Coh \u03c0 0 process is minimal where Z 0 can be viewed as a \u03c1 meson which produces a \u03c0 0 exchanging an isoscalar \u03c9 with A. This minimal contribution of the isovector cur- rent to the Coh \u03c0 0 arises from two reasons: (a) the cross-section of the isovector \u03c1-A interaction is zero in the forward direction, a direction preferred by the nuclear form factor; and (b) the vector component has a contribution proportional to (1 \u2212 2 sin 2 \u03b8 W ) 2 reducing the isovector contribution further, the net reduction with respect to the axial part being a factor of 3.5. The PCAC hypothesis stipulates that for zero-momentum transfer ( Q 2 = 0, where Q 2 is the negative of the square of the four-momentum transfer from the incident neutrino to the target), the \u03bd-A cross-section can be related to the \u03c0-A cross-section. The \u03bd-A cross section in the forward direction is related to the strong \u03c0-A interaction as follows:",

The NOMAD apparatus [20] was composed of several sub-detectors. The active target comprised 132 planes of 3 \u00d7 3 m 2 drift chambers (DC) with an average density similar to that of liquid hydrogen (0.1 gm/cm 3 ). On average, the equivalent material in the DC encountered by particles produced in a \u03bd-interaction was about half a radiation length and a quarter of an hadronic interaction length (\u03bb). The fiducial mass of the NOMAD DC-target, 2.7 tons, was composed primarily of carbon (64%), oxygen (22%), nitrogen (6%), and hydrogen (5%) yielding an effective atomic number, A = 12.8, similar to carbon. Downstream of the DC, there were nine modules of transition radiation detectors (TRD), followed by a preshower (PRS) and a lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The ensemble of DC, TRD, and PRS/ECAL was placed within a dipole magnet providing a 0.4 T magnetic field orthogonal to the neutrino beam line. Two planes of scintillation counters, T 1 and T 2 , positioned upstream and downstream of the TRD, provided the trigger in combination with an anti-coincidence signal, V , from the veto counter upstream and outside the magnet. Downstream of the magnet was a hadron calorimeter, followed by two muon-stations each comprising large area drift chambers and separated by an iron filter placed at 8-and 13-\u03bb's downstream of the ECAL, that provided a clean identification of the muons.

Therefore we have principally relied upon angular variables to determine the signal. Table 1 summarizes the selection of events in the MC samples. The reconstruction efficiency of the Coh \u03c0 0 signal is 7.8% (the BK model yields 7.7%). Table 1 also shows that the NC-Resonance production contributes less than 1% to the sample. In the following the resonance contribution is simply added to the NC-DIS component. The preselected data are subjected to identical cuts. Having identified the two photons, and having imposed the DCA-X/Y cuts, data can be compared with the respective predictions as shown in Table 2. Note that the fraction of events failing the DCA-Z cut is larger in data than those in the Coh \u03c0 0 and NC-DIS simulations. This is due to neutrinos interacting in material just outside the fiducial volume cut such as the magnet, coil, etc., which are not simulated in the MC. Some of these interactions will also produce events with DCA-Z Z Min .

First we present the measurement of background induced by \u03bd-interactions outside the fiducial volume (OBG). As shown in Table 1, the fraction of MC events in the fiducial region but with DCA-Z Z Min is negligible. The 169 data events that fail the DCA-Z cut (see Table 2) are dominated by interactions upstream of the detector ( Z Z Min ); the contribution from the events entering from the sides give a small contribution ( 2% of the background). This is for two reasons: first, since the transverse resolution of DCA-vertex is accurate to \u00b13 cm, the DCA-X and DCA-Y cuts largely eliminate these events; second, among the events relevant to the Coh \u03c0 0 selection the two photons travel along the beam while particles entering the detector from the sides have much larger angles. The 169 events failing the DCA-Z cut (Table 2) are the key to providing the normalization for the outside-background (OBG). To determine the OBG a different data sample is selected in which a vertex is reconstructed upstream of the detector ( Z Z Min ). In this control sample the primary tracks are then ignored and the events are subjected to the Coh \u03c0 0 analysis. A total of 1378 events survive this selection of which 451 (927) events have the DCA vertex within (outside) the fiducial volume. Fig. 3 compares the shape of the Z -distribution of the DCA of the 169 events that fail the DCA cut in the Coh \u03c0 0 signal sample with the 927 events that fail this cut in the control sample.

The choice of variables is dictated by the resolution. The variables \u03b6 \u03b3 1 and \u03b6 \u03b3 2 are correlated while \u0398 12 displays no correlation with the former variables. A \u03c7 2 between data and prediction is defined using two distributions: the two-dimensional \u03b6 \u03b3 1 and \u03b6 \u03b3 2 distribution, and the \u0398 12 distribution. The \u03c7 2 between the data and the prediction is minimized with respect to the Coh \u03c0 0 normalization factor, \u03b1. The expected numbers of OBG and NC-DIS events are determined as described above, and are kept fixed, while the simulated Coh \u03c0 0 sample is normalized to 5000 generated events. The \u03c7 2 is minimized with respect to \u03b1 which is varied between 0 and 2 in steps of 0.01. The minimum \u03c7 2 , 45.1 for 44 degrees of freedom (DoF), is obtained for \u03b1 = 0.985 \u00b1 0.113. The probability of this fit is 0.44. Using the number of Coh \u03c0 0 signal (112.6) in Table 1 and \u03b1 = 0.985, we extract the observed signal: 110.9 \u00b1 12.5. The error is statistical and corresponds to a \u03c7 2 change by one unit.",

The 7.5%  error in the NC-DIS contribution translates to 7.0% in the signal. Since the OBG is entirely determined by the 169 events that fail the DCA-cut, its contribution to the Coh \u03c0 0 signal is computed to be 5.4%. The error in the \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is estimated to be 2.7% determined using \u03b3 -conversions from standard DIS interactions. Finally, the error in the absolute flux determination is determined to be 2.5% which comes about as follows: the error is 2.1% for E \u03bd 30 GeV, 2.6% for 10 E \u03bd 30 GeV, and 4.0% for 2.5 E \u03bd 10 GeV as determined in [24]; these errors are folded in with the Coh \u03c0 0 cross section as a function of E \u03bd yielding an overall flux normalization error of 2.5%.

This value is the product of the fraction of Coh \u03c0 0 events that trigger the apparatus (29.0%), and the recon- struction efficiency (7.8%). The \u03bd-sample is dominated by the \u03bd \u03bcinteractions. The Coh \u03c0 0 sample is corrected for the small contribution from other neutrino species to yield a pure \u03bd \u03bc -contribution. The correction factor to account for the\u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd e , and\u03bd e contributions to the Coh \u03c0 0 interactions is 0.94. The factor takes into account the different energy spectra for the different \u03bd-flavors (we assume that the \u03bd and\u03bd induced Coh \u03c0 0 cross-sections are the same). The error in the Coh \u03c0 0 cross-section due to this 6% correction is 0.6% and is deemed negligible in this analysis.
