It provides natural coupling unification, dynamic electroweak symmetry breaking and a solution to the hierarchy problem. R-parity is assigned to fields as R p = (\u22121) 3B+L+s where B, L, and s are baryon and lepton numbers, and spin of the particle respectively. In models with conserved R-parity superpartners may only be produced in pairs, and the lightest superpartner (LSP) is stable. However R-parity conservation is not a universal property of SUSY models. The most general gaugeinvariant and renormalizable superpotential consists of the R-parity conserving (RPC) main part, and may also contain extra R-parity violating (RPV) terms [3] :",

Invariant mass of the two muons and jets before (left) and after (right) applying the b-tag veto and same-sign muon requirement. Data are compared to the expectation from the simulation (left) and measured backgrounds (right). Signal distributions are shown for three different kinematic configurations for a coupling value of \u03bb 211 = 0.01.   SUSY performed by the LEP experiments [9]. The search concentrates on final states with two muons and at least two jets. Fig. 1 illustrates the simplest possible Feynman diagrams leading to this final state, which is experimentally interesting because the presence of two muons allows to discriminate the signal from background processes. One of the muons is expected to be produced by the resonant slepton while the other muon and two quarks resulting in jets are expected to be produced in the subsequent decay of the neutralino LSP. Due to the Majorana nature of the LSP, the two muons have the same charge with about 50% probability, which allows to discriminate further against the background. Due to the larger valence u-quark content of the initial state protons the configuration with two positively charged muons is about twice as likely as the configuration with two negatively charged muons. The kinematics of this signal is characterized by no missing transverse energy within the detector resolution. For the purpose of this analysis we select events with two same-sign isolated muons with p T > 20 and p T > 15 GeV for the first and second muon respectively. In addition at least two jets with p T > 30 GeV, no b-jets, and E miss T < 50 GeV are required. After this selection, two main background components remain : low cross section backgrounds containing two prompt same-sign leptons such as production of multiple bosons, and backgrounds with high cross-section where leptons from semileptonic decays of c or b-hadrons or other charged particles are wrongly identified as prompt leptons. The first contribution is estimated from the simulation. The latter contribution is difficult to model in simulation, thus it is estimated using data. Fig. 2 illustrates the expected backgrounds before and after the requirement of the two same-sign muons and the b-jets veto. ",

The observations are consistent with the corresponding background estimations, therefore results are combined to put limit on \u03bb 211 for different mSugra models in Fig. 4. Table 2. Observed yields for three-and four-lepton events from 19.5 fb \u2212 1 recorded in 2012.

Expected yields are the sum of simulation and estimates of backgrounds from data in each channel. SR1-SR4 require a b-tagged jet and veto events containing Z bosons. SR5-SR8 contain events that either contain a Z boson or have no b-tagged jet. The channels are mutually exclusive. The uncertainties include statistical and systematic uncertainties.

The different regions, A, B, C, D, and E, for the \u03bb 233 exclusion result from different stop decay products as explained in Table 3. Among modern SUSY models, \"natural\" supersymmetry refers to those characterized by a relatively small fine tuning to describe particle spectra. It requires top squarks (stops), to be lighter than about 1 TeV. The introduction of RPV does not preclude a natural hierarchy and allows the constraints on the stop mass to be relaxed [10].",

            "text": "The analysis described in details in Ref. [6] presents a new approach to a generic interpretation of experimental results. The focus of this analysis is the lepton number violating term \u03bb i jk L i L j\u0113k , which causes the LSP in such a \"Leptonic-RPV\" (LRPV) SUSY model to decay into leptons. SUSY particles are produced in pairs, thus a nonzero \u03bb-term would lead to events with 4 charged leptons produced in LSP decays. Recent searches at the Tevatron [11] and LHC [5,12] placed limits on \u03bb. The main challenge of RPV SUSY searches is that the RPV term exists on top of some underlying RPC SUSY model, with properties which are currently barely constrained. The analyses mentioned above resolve this problem by exploring RPV on top of very specific RPC SUSY models. In this analysis we pursue a significantly less model dependent approach. We require the presence of 4 isolated leptons in the event, as a direct signature of the LRPV SUSY. No other restriction is applied, so the selection efficiency is not directly affected by the underling SUSY event. Irreducible Standard Model backgrounds are estimated from simulation, estimations of fakes are data-driven. The main background for 4-lepton events is found to be ZZ production, so for every event the variable M 1 is calculated as the invariant mass of same-flavor opposite-sign lepton pair that is closest to the mass of Z-boson. M 2 is then calculated as the invariant mass of the remaining lepton pair. 1 * ZZ prediction in \"in Z\" :\"in Z\" region is based on MC normalized to CMS ZZ production cross section measurement, which is correlated with observation in \"in Z\" :\"in Z\" region of this analysis. Table 4 presents the observations and expected backgrounds in different regions in M 1 : M 2 space. Observations and expectations are consistent in all regions. Based on the occupancy of different regions for typical ZZ production events, the signal region is defined as \"M 1 above Z\" or \"M 1 below Z and M 2 above Z\". Then the upper limit on cross section times integrated luminosity times efficiency (\u03c3 \u00d7 L \u00d7 \u03b5) for any physics process beyond the SM contributing to this search region is 3.4 events. The expected upper limit for this observation is 4.7 events. The leptonic decay of the pair of LRPV neutralinos leads to 4 prompt leptons. The kinematics of these leptons are in general driven by the momentum distribution of the decaying neutralinos and their mass. In most scenarios the lepton momentum is well above threshold, which results in high efficiency. However the following effects could reduce the total efficiency :",

Figure 7 (left) presents the efficiency as a function of the T2 model parameters : squark mass and neutralino mass. This distribution illustrates that the total efficiency of this analysis is mostly driven by the neutralino mass, while the squark mass, which drives the neutralino spectrum, affects the efficiency only marginally. To illustrate this further Fig. 7 (right) shows the distribution of the efficiency for different squark masses. This distribution demonstrates, that the variations even over a wide range of squark masses, are within \u00b110%.  If the LSP is produced at the end of a long cascade of decays of SUSY particles, the LSP p T spectra will be significantly softer than for LSPs produced in two-body decays of the T2 scenario. To study the effect of soft spectra we consider another extreme case : neutralino pairs produced in rest in the detector frame. We generate the corresponding dataset by letting the neutralino decay into (e + , e \u2212 , \u03bd) or (\u00b5 + , \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03bd). Figure 8 (left) shows the efficiency as a function of the neutralino mass overlaid with the efficiency band obtained from the T2+LRPV model presented in Fig. 7 (right). It demonstrates that the difference between the T2+LRPV case and the stopped neutralino case is below \u00b110%.  The isolation efficiency for isolated leptons from RPV decays depends on the occupancy of the event, which in turn depends on the content of the underlying SUSY event. To study how strong the influence of different underlying SUSY models and different SUSY production mechanisms is, we re-use the data samples produced in a previous CMS analysis [14]. These are MC samples for about 7300 different RPC phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [15] model points, each one containing 10000 events, selected to fulfill different pre-CMS observations. The pMSSM model is an excellent proxy for the full MSSM with a sufficiently small number of parameters [14]. The available datasets for this set of pMSSM models is to date the biggest sample of varying SUSY models available to us. To evaluate the effect of different occupancies in each event of the pMSSM, we start by extracting the generator-level information about the neutralino. Then we generate a neutralino RPV decay into two leptons and a neutrino and finally calculate the reconstruction level isolation around the direction of the obtained leptons. The event is accepted if the isolation for each of the 4 charged leptons satisfies the isolation requirements for prompt leptons used in this analysis. Figure 9 presents the efficiencies for different SUSY models as a function of the neutralino mass in each model. Nearly all SUSY models have a 4lepton isolation efficiency in the range between 0.5 and 1. The green and yellow shaded areas in the plot contain 68% and 95% of the model points respectively.",

For all presented searches observations are consistent with expectations from the Standard Model, thus the corresponding limits on presence of new physics are set. We also present a new approach of generalizing physics interpretations of experimental observations. Sampling of a big set of pMSSM models allows to check a model dependency for obtained results, thus making more general conclusions possible.",
