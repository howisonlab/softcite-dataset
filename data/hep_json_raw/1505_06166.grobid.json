In particular, they can provide information on particle-formation mechanisms and on the properties of the medium at chemical freeze-out. Furthermore they contribute to the systematic study of parton energy loss and quark recombination. Measurements of resonances in pp and in p-Pb collisions provide a necessary baseline for heavy-ion data and help to disentangle initial-state effects from medium-induced effects. In this paper the latest ALICE results on mid-rapidity K * (892) 0 and \u03c6(1020) production in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies are presented.",

            "text": "Hadronic resonances are sensitive probes for the different phases of the evolution of the medium produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their lifetimes are, in fact, in the range of few fm/c to some tens of fm/c, which is comparable with the one (\u223c10 fm/c) estimated for the created fireball. In these collisions a hot and dense state of matter [1][2][3], the quark-gluon plasma, is expected to be produced. At a critical temperature of about 160 MeV a cross-over transition between the partonic (i.e. a system with deconfined quarks) and hadronic phases is expected to take place. After the chemical freeze-out the system continues to expand and to cool until the kinetic freeze-out is reached. Modifications of the yield, the mean transverse momentum p T and ratio of the yields of resonances to stable particles can provide information about the regeneration and re-scattering effects in the hadronic phase. In fact the final recostructible resonance yields depend not only on the chemical freeze-out temperature but also on the scattering cross section of the resonance decay products and the timescale between the chemical and the kinetic freeze-out, which control the fraction of 'undetected' particles. However resonances may be regenerated by pseudo-elastic interactions in the hadronic medium, a process driven by the cross-section of the interacting hadrons.",

More information about the performance of ALICE can be found in [12]. The K * (892) 0 and \u03c6(1020) production has been measured by reconstructing the resonances through their main hadronic decay: K * (892) 0 \u2212\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 (and corresponding antiparticle) and \u03c6\u2212\u2192K + K \u2212 . All measurements of K * (892) 0 and K * (892) 0 are averaged and these mesons are referred to as K * 0 in the following. In pp and in Pb-Pb collisions resonances are measured in one unit of rapidity |y| < 0.5 in the centre-of-mass reference frame, while in  p-Pb the rapidity range is restricted to -0.5 < y < 0, in order to ensure the best detector acceptance with the shifted centre-of-mass of the system. The position of the primary vertex is estimated using the tracks reconstructed in the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and its component along the beam axis is required to be within 10 cm from the centre of the ALICE detector. The VZERO detectors, two scintillator hodoscopes covering the pseudo-rapidity ranges 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 (VZERO-A) and -3.7 < \u03b7 < -1.7 (VZERO-C), were used for event triggering and the definition of centrality and multiplicity classes respectively in Pb-Pb [17] and p-Pb [18] collisions. Identification of pions and kaons is carried out using the measurement of the specific energy loss dE/dx in the TPC. The TPC dE/dx measurements allow pions to be separated from kaons for momenta up to p \u223c 0.7 GeV/c, while the proton/antiproton band starts to overlap with the pion/kaon band at p \u223c 1 GeV/c. An improvement in the significance of the signal has been achieved using the information from the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector, for tracks for which it is available. The TOF allows pions and kaons to be unambiguously identified up to p \u223c 1.5-2.0 GeV/c. The two mesons can be distinguished from (anti)protons up to p \u223c 2.5 GeV/c.",

In Fig. 6     lisions are explained as a consequence of collective hydrodynamical flow. The observed increase of the p T as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity observed in pp collisions [25] has been attributed to color reconnection between strings formed by multiple parton-parton interactions. A similar effect could be present in p-Pb collisions and may explain the deviation of the observed p T from the one expected from a sum of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions [25].

In p-Pb collisions \u03c6/K \u2212 is rather independent of the event multiplicity class and K * 0 /K \u2212 lies on the interpolation from pp to peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. The \u03c6/K \u2212 ratio in central Pb-Pb collisions is almost flat and it is consistent with the estimate of a grand-canonical thermal model [26], which has a chemical freeze-out temperature of 156 MeV and a baryochemical potential of 0 MeV and does not include re-scattering effects. On the contrary, the K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio exhibits a clear suppression with the increase of the fireball size, i.e. going from peripheral to most central Pb-Pb collisions, where the measured ratio is about 60% of the predicted thermal model value. Considering the factor of about 10 between the lifetimes of the two resonances, the origin of the differences in the K * 0 and \u03c6 production could be related to a large modification of the K * yield due to the pion rescattering mechanism \u03c3(\u03c0,\u03c0), which destroys the pion-kaon correlation of the K * 0 decay products. By assuming a chemical freeze-out temperature of 156 MeV, a model-dependent estimate of 2 fm/c as the lower limit of the time between the chemical and kinetic freeze-out has been extracted [9] using the measured K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio.",

To investigate the p T dependence of the observed suppression the blast-wave model [   an expected transverse-momentum distribution without rescattering effects for K * 0 and \u03c6 at kinetic freeze-out. In Fig. 8 the transverse momentum distribution of K * 0 and \u03c6 resonances in central (0-20%) and peripheral (60-80%) Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are compared to the blast-wave prediction for the spectral shape. The parameters of the blast-wave curves are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the p T distributions of charged particles (pions, kaons and protons) in Pb-Pb collisions at the same collision energy [22]. The curves are normalized to the expected resonance yields estimated by multiplying the mea-sured yield of charged kaons in Pb-Pb collisions [22] by the K * 0 /K and \u03c6/K ratios given by a thermal-model fit to ALICE data [26]. In the p T range less than 2 GeV/c the \u03c6 data are satisfactorily described by the prediction in both central and peripheral collisions. The same conclusions hold for K * 0 in peripheral collisions, where the data/theory ratio does not appear to deviate significantly from unity. On the other hand, for p T < 2 GeV/c in central collisions, the K * 0 appears suppressed by a factor 0.6. The deviation from unity is about 3 times larger than the uncertain-  ties, suggesting that K * 0 has undergone non-negligible rescattering effects.",

In Fig. 9 the nuclear modification factor of \u03c6 in 0-5% central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV is shown compared to that of identified stable hadrons. In central collisions the suppression at p T > 8 GeV/c of the \u03c6 is consistent with that measured for the stable hadrons (\u03c0, K and p), thus supporting once more the observation of the flavourindependence of the partonic energy loss in the medium. However, a large baryon/meson dependence is observed for low p T in particular R AA (p) > R AA (\u03c0). It is worth noting that the R AA of the \u03c6 meson is slightly larger than that of \u03c0 and lower than the R AA of the p. The production of \u03c6 in minimum bias p-Pb and pp collisions is compared by computing the R pPb (Fig. 10). The reference pp spectrum at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV has been obtained from interpolation of the spectra measured in pp at 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV, following the same procedure described in [16] for identified charged hadrons. The trend of the R pPb for the \u03c6 exhibits a moderate Cronin peak (reaching a value of about 1.2) for 3 < p T < 6 GeV/c. Moreover, no Cronin peak is observed for the pions, while a stronger Cronin peak is present for the protons in the same p T range. For the \u03c6 and the stable hadrons no suppression is seen at high-p T (p T > 8 GeV/c) in p-Pb collisions compared to pp.",

The K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio is suppressed in central Pb-Pb collisions, consistent with substantial re-scattering of K * 0 decay daughters in the hadronic phase, while the \u03c6/K \u2212 is not suppressed consistently with \u03c6 longer lifetime. The (p+p)/\u03c6 ratio is flat for p T < 3-4 GeV/c in central Pb-Pb collisions, suggesting that the low-p T spectral shapes of the p and \u03c6 are mainly determined by the similar particle mass. In pp and in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions as well in p-Pb collisions for all event multiplicity classes a steep decrease with p T is observed for the (p+p)/\u03c6 ratio. Only in central p-Pb collisions (i.e. for 0-5% VZERO-A (V0A) multiplicity event class) and for low p T (p T < 1.5 GeV/c) the ratio shows a hint of flattening, which, as for Pb-Pb collisions, could suggest the onset of a collective behaviour.",
