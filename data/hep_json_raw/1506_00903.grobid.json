The W \u00fe b final state with W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd is reconstructed using muons with a transverse momentum, p T , larger than 25 GeV in the pseudorapidity range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5. The b jets are required to have 50 < p T < 100 GeV and 2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.2, while the transverse component of the sum of the muon and b-jet momenta must satisfy p T > 20 GeV. The results are based on data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 and 2.0 fb \u22121 collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV by LHCb.

            "text": "The production of top quarks (t) from proton-proton (pp) collisions in the forward region is of considerable experimental and theoretical interest. In the standard model (SM), four processes make significant contributions to top quark production: tt pair production, single-top production via processes mediated by a W boson in the t channel (qb \u2192 q 0 t) or in the s channel (qq 0 \u2192 tb), and single top produced in association with a W boson (gb \u2192 tW). The initial-state b quarks arise from gluon splitting to bb pairs or from the intrinsic b quark content in the proton. Top quarks decay almost entirely via t \u2192 Wb. The SM predicts that about 75% of t \u2192 Wb decays in the forward region are due to tt pair production. The remaining 25% are mostly due to t-channel single-top production, with s-channel and associated single-top production making percent-level contributions.",

Forward tt events can be used to constrain the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) at a large momentum fraction, resulting in reduced theoretical uncertainty for many SM predictions [3]. Furthermore, both single-top and tt cross-section measurements in the forward region will provide important experimental tests of differential next-to-next-to-leading order theoretical calculations as they become available [4].",

Figure 3 shows that the W \u00fe c yield versus p T \u00f0\u03bc \u00fe c\u00de agrees with the SM prediction. Since the W \u00fe c final state does not have any significant contributions from diboson or top quark production in the SM, this comparison validates the analysis procedures. Figure 4 shows a fit to the p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de distribution built from the b-tagged jets from the full data sample. For p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de > 0.9 the data are dominantly from W decays. Figure 5 shows the yield and charge asymmetry distributions obtained as a function of p T \u00f0\u03bc \u00fe b\u00de.

As can be seen, the data cannot be described by the expected direct W \u00fe b contribution alone. The observed yield is about 3 times larger than the SM prediction without a top quark contribution, In Ref. [19], W \u00fe b is studied in a larger fiducial region [p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de > 20 GeV; p T \u00f0j\u00de > 20 GeV], where the top quark contribution is expected to be about half as large as that of direct W\u00feb production.

This validates the direct W \u00fe b prediction, since direct W \u00fe b production is the dominant contribution to the larger fiducial region.",
