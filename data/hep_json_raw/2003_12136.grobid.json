            "text": "Elastic scattering plays an important role in protonproton (pp) scattering at high energies, as evidenced by the fact that it contributes about 20% of the total cross section at the highest Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies [1]. The pp elastic and total cross sections have been measured at colliders with center of mass energies 2.76 \u2264 \u221a s \u2264 13 TeV at the LHC [1] and at the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV [2]. It is important, however, to have measurements in the energy gap between the ISR and the LHC to constrain the phenomenological models of the pp cross sections since one still expects a difference between pp and protonantiproton (pp) cross sections within the RHIC energy range. The latter were measured up to \u221a s = 1.8 TeV at the Tevatron [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Both the values of the cross sections and the difference between pp and pp affect phenomenological models [9][10][11][12][13][14].",

A modification of the vacuum chamber was required and the RP system was fully integrated with the STAR experiment.

Because of the symmetry of the RHIC rings, the field in the DX magnets on both sides of the IP are identical at the 10 \u22123 level. Hence, the bending angles of the magnets are also the same. The scattering angle in the y, z plane, \u03b8 y , is determined from the y-coordinate measured in the RPs. Consequently, the local angles at the RPs \u03b8 x , \u03b8 y are the same as the scattering angles at the IP. The data were acquired with normal \u03b2 * = 0.85 m and were taken during the last four hours of an eight-hour store during the pp run in 2015. The last four hours were chosen to have beams with reduced tails, thus with lower singles rates and background in the RP trigger counters. Three special luminosity measurements using Van der Meer scans [19] were performed to determine the luminosity and to reduce the systematic uncertainty on the luminosity measurement. The RPs were moved as close to the beam as possible, to about 8\u03c3 y of the beam size in the y-coordinate, which was closer than during nominal data taking. The average instantaneous luminosity was \u2248 45 \u2022 10 30 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . For this luminosity, the number of interactions per bunch crossing was 0.225 on average.

The fit results to B and to d\u03c3 el /dt| t=0 changed by 0.01 GeV \u22122 and 0.01 mb/GeV 2 respectively. Since they did not change the total systematic uncertainty within accuracy displayed in Table I, they are not listed in there. The evaluation of the uncertainties due to the beam angular divergence, the vertex positions and their spread, and incoming beam angles was based on MC simulations described in the previous section. We found that the largest single source of the systematic error of the t-scale of the experiment was due to the beam-tilt angle. This shift of the t-distribution scale was studied with the MC simulation using the upper limits on the beam-tilt angle obtained from data. It resulted in an uncertainty on the fitted slope parameter of about 2%.",

They are: the intercept of the differential cross section d\u03c3 el /dt| t=0 ; the slope parameter B; the total cross section \u03c3 tot obtained using optical theorem; the elastic cross section \u03c3 el , which was obtained by simply integrating the fitted exponential over all t; the elastic cross section integrated within the STAR t-range \u03c3 det el ; and the inelastic cross section \u03c3 inel , which was obtained by subtracting \u03c3 el from \u03c3 tot . As such, both \u03c3 el and \u03c3 inel are estimates. Nevertheless, we see good agreement with the world data. This is because most of the \u03c3 el is in the purely exponential region measured in this experiment. The last column of Table I lists the total systematic uncertainty, which was obtained by adding the individual systematic uncertainties in quadrature. The \u03c1-parameter column in the table lists the systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the hadronic scattering amplitude.",
