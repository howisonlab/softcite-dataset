The cross-section in this kinematic range is determined to be \u03c3 acc inel = 55.0 \u00b1 2.4 mb with an experimental uncertainty that is dominated by systematic contributions. Extrapolation to the full phase space, using Pythia 6, yields \u03c3 inel = 66.9 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b1 4.4 mb, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second is due to the extrapolation.",

            "text": "The inelastic cross-section is a fundamental observable in high-energy hadronic interactions. It is also important in astroparticle physics for models of extensive air showers induced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere [1]. Currently, it is not possible to calculate its value from first principles because quantum chromodynamics cannot yet be solved for soft processes. Phenomenological models assume a rise of the inelastic cross-section with energy according to a power law [2,3], while not exceeding the Froissart-Martin bound [4,5], which is asymptotically proportional to ln 2 s. Although originally the Froissart-Martin bound was derived for the total cross-section, later developments show that it is also valid for the inelastic cross-section [6].",

            "text": "To study the sensitivity of the analysis to the choice of the cuts on track quality and DCA, the measurements are performed for two cases: \"loose\" settings accepting most reconstructed tracks, and \"tight\" ones selecting mainly the cores of the \u03c7 2 /NDF and DCA distributions. Figure 1 shows the normalized multiplicity distributions of tracks from the luminous region that are recorded in the fiducial region of the analysis for the tight cut settings in the field-down configuration. The distributions have an approximately exponential shape, as can be seen from the superimposed curves. The small disagreement seen at low multiplicities is addressed when discussing systematic uncertainties. Table 1 gives the interaction and event counts in simulation and data. The simulations are based on a total of I MC inelastic pp interactions. The event counts in the simulation are given for an average of P = 1.05 interactions per event and for both settings of the analysis cuts. One finds a typical value for the correction factor \u03b5 of 0.87. For a given magnet polarity, the inelastic cross-section is taken to be the central value of the measurements with loose and tight cuts. The final cross-section result is determined by the arithmetic average of the central values for the two magnet polarities. Here any biases that change sign under inversion of the field cancel exactly and uncertainties that are not fully correlated between the two configurations are reduced. Within the acceptance of LHCb, the inelastic  pp cross-section with at least one prompt long-lived charged particle having p T > 0.2 GeV/c and 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5 is found to be \u03c3 acc inel = 54.96 \u00b1 0.01 mb, where the uncertainty is purely statistical.",

The determination of the impact of the selection cuts on the event selection efficiency requires a proper modelling of the tails of the distributions of the selection variables. The corresponding systematic uncertainties are found to be 0.3% by varying the selection cuts between loose and tight settings. The influence of the detector calibration on the reconstruction of charged tracks is tested by comparing the nominal event counts with those obtained when using an alternative version of the reconstruction code. For the loose cuts the changes are small, but for the tight cuts variations in the event counts of 1.1% for field-down and 0.5% for field-up are observed, which are assigned as systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty on the reconstruction efficiency of a single track was found to be 3% [24]. After convolution with the track multiplicity distribution of the events, this translates into an uncertainty of 0.8% in the event selection efficiency. The systematic uncertainty related to the modelling of the charged particle multiplicity distribution in the kinematic acceptance is estimated from cthe difference between the observed average multiplicities in data and simulation. At generator level the difference is about twice as large, and a systematic uncertainty of 0.5 units is assigned, which translates to a 1% uncertainty in the event selection efficiency.",

Since the interactiontype fractions are only weakly constrained by experiment (see e.g. ref. [7]), the values of f given in table 3 are not used in the following. To determine an estimate for the uncertainty of the extrapolation factor, a Monte Carlo approach is used. Multiplicities and visibilities are generated according to Gaussian densities with parameters as given in table 3. The interaction type fractions that go into the extrapolation factor are then determined subject to the constraints that each of them lies between zero and one, that they sum to unity, and that the zero-suppressed average multiplicity of the mix is consistent with the generator level average multiplicity of the Pythia 6 simulation, 10.93, which provides a good description of the data. The distribution of the average multiplicity is modelled according to a Gaussian function with this mean value and standard deviation 0.5. The method yields a distribution for s extr with an average of 1.17 and a standard deviation of 0.08, which is assigned as the systematic uncertainty on the extrapolation factor obtained from the fully simulated Monte Carlo.
