            "text": "Results of a search for supersymmetry are presented using events with a photon, an electron or muon, and large missing transverse momentum. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, produced by the LHC and collected with the CMS detector in 2016. Theoretical models with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking predict events with photons in the final state, as well as electroweak gauge bosons decaying to leptons. Searches for events with a photon, a lepton, and missing transverse momentum are sensitive probes of these models. No excess of events is observed beyond expectations from standard model processes. The results of the search are interpreted in the context of simplified models inspired by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. These models are used to derive upper limits on the production cross sections and set lower bounds on masses of supersymmetric particles. Gaugino masses below 930 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level in a simplified model with electroweak production of a neutralino and chargino. For simplified models of gluino and squark pair production, gluino masses up to 1.75 TeV and squark masses up to 1.43 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.",

Models utilizing a general gauge-mediated (GGM) SUSY mechanism [1][2][3][4][5][6], with the assumption that R parity [7] is conserved, often lead to final states containing photons and significant transverse momentum imbalance [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Final states with an additional lepton enhance the sensitivity to the electroweak (EW) production of SUSY particles, making signatures with both leptons and photons an important part of the SUSY search program at the LHC.",

It escapes detection, leading to missing momentum in the event. Except for direct LSP pair production, each produced SUSY particle initiates a decay chain that yields the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) decaying to the LSP. The signature of the event depends sensitively on the nature of the NLSP. In most GGM models, the NLSP is taken to be a bino-or wino-like neutralino or a wino-like chargino, where the bino and wino are the superpartners of the SM U(1) and SU(2) gauge particles, respectively. Typically, a neutral NLSP \u03c7 0 will decay to a photon or a Z boson, while a charged NLSP \u03c7 \u00b1 will produce a W boson, where both vector bosons can decay leptonically.",

In order to study the SM backgrounds, discussed more fully in section 5, samples of W\u03b3 events are generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.3.3 [35] at leading order (LO), while the Z\u03b3, Drell-Yan, JHEP01 (2019)154WW(+\u03b3), WZ(+\u03b3), and tt (+\u03b3) background processes are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO). All samples use the NNPDF 3.0 [36] parton distribution functions (PDFs). The generated events are interfaced with pythia 8.205 or 8.212 [37] with the CUETP8M1 underlying event tune [38] for simulation of parton showering and hadronization. Renormalization and factorization scales and PDF uncertainties are derived with the use of the SysCalc package [39]. The Z\u03b3, Drell-Yan, WW(+\u03b3), WZ(+\u03b3), and tt (+\u03b3) samples are scaled to the integrated luminosity using the theoretical cross sections at NLO precision [35]. For the W\u03b3 sample, a next-to-NLO (NNLO) scale factor of 1.34 [40] is applied to the LO cross section to account for higher-order corrections. The CMS detector response is simulated using a Geant4-based [41] package. The effects of pileup are modeled in the simulation by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events on the corresponding hardscattering event, and the distribution of the pileup vertices is reweighted to match that observed in data.",

Second, the misidentification rate is defined as the ratio of the number of misidentified photons to the total number of photon-like objects in the control sample.

The misidentification rate for the hadronic control sample is determined through an assessment of the fraction of events with jet-to-photon misidentification among the photon candidates. This fraction is denoted as the \"hadron fraction\". The measurement is performed in the control region p miss T < 70 GeV from a fit to the isolation variable distribution based on two templates, one representing pure photons obtained from \u03b3+jet simulated MC events and one modeling the events with jet-to-photon misidentification, where the template for those events is obtained by inverting the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 requirement on the signal-photon candidates.

            "text": "tion is obtained by allowing each bin of the template to vary independently according to a Gaussian distribution. Systematic uncertainties in the magnitude of the normalization are determined by allowing the number of subtracted events from the estimated backgrounds to vary within their uncertainties, as well as the PDF and renormalization and factorization scales of the V\u03b3 template to vary by one standard deviation around their nominal values. For the rare EW backgrounds, a 50% uncertainty is assigned to the cross sections to cover the difference between the calculated cross sections and the latest CMS measurements [52,53]. The subdominant systematic uncertainties come from the modeling of the misidentified photons. Different choices of control samples and parameterized functions are studied to evaluate the size of these systematic effects. The uncertainties in the number of misidentified photons with p T < 200 GeV are less than 20%. A larger uncertainty, up to 56%, is caused by the limited number of events in the control sample and applies only to the high-p T bins, where the misidentified photons contribute less than 10% of the total background, resulting in a small effect on the total background prediction. For the backgrounds obtained from simulation, systematic uncertainties from the jet energy scale are evaluated by varying the corresponding scale by one standard deviation around its nominal value [54]. Uncertainties in the signal cross sections used in the simulation due to the PDFs and the renormalization and factorization scales are taken from refs. [42][43][44][45][46]. The additional shape uncertainty in the signal sample due to the choice of the renormalization and factorization scales is estimated by varying the scales upward and downward by a factor of two with respect to their nominal values. Finally, the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity of the data sample is 2.5% [55]. (a) Bkg. Data  Data",

The SM background prediction, signal expectation, and observed number of events in each signal search region of the e\u03b3 and \u00b5\u03b3 channels defined above are combined into one statistical interpretation, and studied as a multichannel counting experiment. Figure 6 shows the observed and expected 95% CL upper limits on the cross section for the TChiWg model as a function of the NLSP mass, together with the theoretical cross section for \u03c7 0 \u03c7 \u00b1 pair production.

This analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016. The data are examined in bins of the photon transverse energy, the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum, and the scalar sum of jet energies. The standard model background is evaluated primarily using control samples in the data, with simulation used to evaluate backgrounds from electroweak processes. The data are found to agree with the standard model expectation, without significant excess in the search region. The results of the search are interpreted as 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections of supersymmetric particles in the context of simplified models [23] motivated by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. For strong production models, such as the T5Wg simplified model of gluino pair production and the T6Wg model of squark pair production, this search excludes gluinos (squarks) with masses up to 1.75 (1.43) TeV in the T5Wg (T6Wg) scenarios. The TChiWg simplified model, based on direct electroweak production of a neutralino and chargino, is excluded for next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle masses below 930 GeV, extending the current best limit by about 150 GeV [19].",
