One of the main goals of Hyper-Kamiokande is the study of C P asymmetry in the lepton sector using accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino beams. In this paper, the physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino experiment using the Hyper-Kamiokande detector and a neutrino beam from the J-PARC proton synchrotron is presented. The analysis uses the framework and systematic uncertainties derived from the ongoing T2K experiment. With a total exposure of 7.5 MW \u00d710 7 s integrated proton beam power (corresponding to 1.56 \u00d7 10 22 protons on target with a 30 GeV proton beam) to a 2.5 \u2022 off-axis neutrino beam, it is expected that the leptonic C P phase \u03b4 C P can be determined to better than 19 degrees for all possible values of \u03b4 C P , and C P violation can be established with a statistical significance of more than 3 \u03c3 (5 \u03c3 ) for 76% (58%) of the \u03b4 C P parameter space. Using both \u03bd e appearance and \u03bd \u03bc disappearance data, the expected 1 \u03c3 uncertainty of sin 2 \u03b8 23 is 0.015(0.006) for sin 2  ",

            "text": "The discovery of neutrino oscillations by the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) experiment in 1998 [1] opened a new window to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Evidence of neutrino oscillations is one of the most convincing experimental proofs known today for the existence of BSM physics at work. The mixing parameters of neutrinos were found to be remarkably different from those of quarks, which suggests the presence of an unknown flavor symmetry waiting to be explored. The extremely small masses of neutrinos compared with those of their charged partners lead to the preferred scenario of a seesaw mechanism [2][3][4][5], in which small neutrino masses are a reflection of the ultra-high-energy scale of BSM physics. Furthermore, a theoretical framework called leptogenesis points to the intriguing possibility that C P asymmetries related to flavor mixing among the three generations of neutrinos may have played an important role in creating the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe [6]. This makes a study of the full picture of neutrino masses and mixings and the measurement of the C P asymmetry in the neutrino sector among the most important and urgent subjects in today's elementary particle physics world.",

The Super-K detector has successfully measured all three angles. The angle \u03b8 23 was first measured in atmospheric neutrino observations [1], \u03b8 12 was constrained in solar neutrino observations [8] (together with another water Cherenkov detector SNO [9]), and the evidence of nonzero \u03b8 13 was found by T2K [10], which used Super-K as the far detector. In 2013, T2K established \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation with 7.3 \u03c3 significance, leading the way towards C P violation measurements in neutrinos [11] in combination with precise measurements of \u03b8 13 by reactor neutrino experiments [12][13][14].

The baseline design of Hyper-K is based on the well proven technologies employed and tested at Super-K.

It has been discussed, however, that they could be related to each other, and the C P-violating phase in the MNS matrix could also be responsible for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis in some scenarios. For example, in Refs. [26,27], in the context of the seesaw mechanism, it has been pointed out that, assuming the hierarchical mass spectrum for right-handed Majorana neutrinos with the lightest mass being 5\u00d710 12 GeV, the observed baryon asymmetry could be generated through leptogenesis if | sin \u03b8 13 sin \u03b4 C P | 0.1, which is compatible with the current neutrino data. Hence, measurement of C P asymmetry in neutrino oscillations may provide a clue for understanding the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.",

The third term, containing sin \u03b4 C P , is the C P-violating term that flips sign between \u03bd and \u03bd and thus introduces C P asymmetry if sin \u03b4 C P is nonzero. The last two terms are due to the matter effect. Those terms that contain a change their sign depending on the mass hierarchy. As seen from the definition of a, the amount of asymmetry due to the matter effect is proportional to the neutrino energy at a fixed value of L/E \u03bd . A direct test of C P violation, in a model-independent way, is possible by measuring both neutrino and anti-neutrino appearance probabilities. If the mass hierarchy is not known, the sensitivity of C P violation is affected by the presence of the matter effect. However, the mass hierarchy could be determined by the atmospheric neutrino measurement in Hyper-K and several measurements by other experiments.",

Cosmological observations will provide the information on neutrino masses. An observation of neutrinoless double \u03b2 decay in the next 10 years would be evidence that the neutrino is a Majorana particle with the inverted mass hierarchy. Following this progress, we definitely need a new experiment to discover C P violation in neutrinos, and to unambiguously establish the mass hierarchy and \u03b8 23 octant.

J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) is one of the world's leading facilities in neutrino physics, currently providing a beam for the T2K experiment. We will utilize the full potential of this existing facility with future increase of the beam power to the designed value of 750 kW and beyond. The J-PARC accelerator cascade [52] consists of a normal-conducting LINAC as an injection system, a rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS), and a main ring synchrotron (MR). In the fast extraction mode operation, MR has achieved 1.24 \u00d7 10 14 protons per pulse (ppp) beam intensity, which is a world record for extracted ppp for any synchrotron. The corresponding beam power is 240 kW. The upgrade scenario of the J-PARC accelerator [53] is being implemented to reach the designed power of 750 kW in forthcoming years, with a typical planned parameter set as listed in Table 2. This will double the current repetition rate by (i) replacing the magnet power supplies, (ii) replacing the RF system, and (iii) upgrading injection/extraction devices. The designed power of 750 kW will be achieved well before Hyper-K starts data taking. Furthermore, conceptual studies on how to realize 1-2 MW beam powers and even beyond, such as by raising the RCS top energy, enlarging the MR aperture, or inserting an \"emittance-damping\" ring between the RCS and MR, are now underway [54]. Figure 2 shows an overview of the neutrino experimental facility [55,56]. The primary beamline guides the extracted proton beam to a production target/pion-focusing horn system in a target station. The pions decay into muons and neutrinos during their flight in a 110 m-long decay volume. A graphite beam dump is installed at the end of the decay volume, and muon monitors downstream of the beam dump monitor the muon profile. A near neutrino detector complex is situated 280 m downstream of the target to monitor neutrinos at production. To generate a narrow-band neutrino beam, the beamline utilizes an off-axis beam configuration [57], with the capability of varying the off-axis angle in a range from 2.0 \u2022 to 2.5 \u2022 . The latter value has been used for the T2K experiment and is also assumed for the proposed project. The centerline of the beamline extends 295 km to the west, passing midway between Tochibora (Hyper-K candidate site) and Mozumi (where Super-K is located), so that both sites have identical off-axis angles.",

In this section, we present basic considerations on the near-detector requirements and conceptual designs. More concrete requirements and a detector design will be presented in the future. We assume the use of T2K near detectors [55], INGRID and ND280, possibly with an upgrade. The INGRID detector [59] consists of 16 iron-scintillator modules configured in a cross pattern centered on the beam axis 280 m downstream of the T2K target. The rate of interactions in each module is measured and a profile is constructed to constrain the neutrino beam direction. The ND280 off-axis detector is located 280 m downstream of the T2K target as well, but at an angle of 2.5 degrees away from the beam direction. It consists of the P0D \u03c0 0 detector [60], time projection chambers (TPCs) [61], fine-grain scintillator bar detectors (FGDs) [62] and surrounding electromagnetic calorimeters (ECALs) [63]. The detectors are immersed in a 0.2 T magnetic field and the magnetic yoke is instrumented with plastic scintillator panels for muon range detection [64]. The magnetic field allows for momentum measurement and sign selection of charged particles. The magnetization of ND280 is particularly important for operation in anti-neutrino mode where the neutrino background is large. In that case, ND280 is able to separate the \"right-sign\" \u03bc + from the \"wrong-sign\" \u03bc \u2212 . The P0D and FGDs act as the neutrino targets, while the TPCs provide measurements of momentum and ionizing energy loss for particle identification. The P0D and one of the FGDs include passive water layers that allow for neutrino interaction rate measurements on the same target as Super-K. ND280 has been employed to measure the rates of charged-current (CC) \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd e interactions, as well as neutral-current (NC) \u03c0 0 interactions.",

The use of a water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) developed at BNL [66] is being explored in the context of a tracking detector with comparable or finer granularity than the FGD to allow the detailed reconstruction of the hadronic system emerging from the neutrino interactions or a larger detector with coarser segmentation that would allow high-statistics studies. Either would significantly enhance the study of neutrino interactions on water by reducing the reliance on subtraction and enhancing the reconstruction capabilities relative to the currently deployed passive targets. Finally, a high-pressure TPC that can contain various noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) to serve both as the target and tracking medium is being studied. Such a detector would allow the ultimate resolution of the particles emitted from the target nucleus while allowing a study of the A-dependence of the cross sections and final-state interactions to rigorously test models employed in neutrino event generators.",

An alternative approach is to build a water Cherenkov (WC) near detector to measure the cross section on H 2 O directly and with no need for a subtraction analysis. This approach was taken by K2K [35] and was proposed for T2K [67]. The MiniBooNE experiment has also employed a mineral-oil Cherenkov detector at a short baseline to great success [68].

            "text": "Water is the target material and signal-sensitive medium of the detector, and thus its quality directly affects the physics sensitivity. In Super-Kamiokande the water purification system has been continually modified and improved over the course of two decades. As a result, the transparency is now kept above 100 m and is very stable, and the radon concentration in the tank is held below 1 mBq/m 3 . Following this success, the Hyper-Kamiokande water system has been designed based on the current Super-Kamiokande water system with scaling-up of the process speeds to 1200 m 3 /hour for water circulation and 400 m 3 /hour for radon free air generation. With these systems, the water quality in Hyper-Kamiokande is expected to be the same as that in Super-Kamiokande. Adding dissolved gadolinium sulfate for efficient tagging of neutrons has been studied as an option to enhance the Hyper-K physics capability. The feasibility of adding Gd to Super-K [69] is now being studied with the EGADS (Evaluating Gadolinium's Action on Detector Systems) project in Kamioka.  We have been careful to keep the possibility of gadolinium loading in mind when designing the overall Hyper-Kamiokande water system. We have evaluated the expected performance of the Hyper-K detector using the MC simulation and reconstruction tools under development. We have been developing a detector simulation dedicated to Hyper-K based on \"WCSim\" [70], which is an open-source water Cherenkov detector simulator based on the GEANT4 library [71,72]. A new reconstruction algorithm developed for Super-K/T2K [11], named \"fiTQun,\" has been adopted for the Hyper-K analysis. It uses a maximum likelihood fit with charge and time probability density functions constructed for every PMT hit assuming several sets of physics variables (such as vertex, direction, momentum, and particle type) [11,73].",

Figure 5 shows the likelihood function for the particle identification. A negative (positive) value indicates an electron-like (\u03bc-like) particle. It demonstrates a clear separation of electrons and muons. The obtained performance of Hyper-Kamiokande is compared with the performance of SK-II (20% photo coverage, old electronics) and SK-IV (40% photo coverage, new electronics) in Table 5. The vertex resolution for muon events will be improved to the same level as Super-K with an update of the reconstruction program. From the preliminary studies, the performance of Hyper-K is similar to or possibly better than SK-II or SK-IV with the new algorithm. In the physics sensitivity study described in Sect. 4, a Super-K full MC simulation with the SK-IV configuration is used PTEP 2015, 053C02 K. Abe et al.",

NA61/SHINE also took data with a replica of the 90 cm-long T2K target, which will reduce the uncertainties related to the secondary interactions inside the target. For the studies presented in this document, the T2K flux simulation has been used with the horn currents raised from 250 kA to 320 kA. The flux is estimated for both polarities of the horn fields, corresponding to neutrino enhanced and anti-neutrino enhanced fluxes. The calculated fluxes at Hyper-K, without oscillations, are shown in Fig. 8.",

The uncertainties on the hadronic interaction modeling are the largest contribution to the flux uncertainty and may be reduced by using the hadron production data with a replica of the T2K target. A preliminary analysis using a subset of the replica target data from NA61/SHINE has shown that it can be used to predict the T2K flux [81]. Since it is expected that replica target data will be available for future long-baseline neutrino experiments, the Hyper-K flux uncertainty is estimated assuming the expected uncertainties on the measurement of particle multiplicities from the replica target. Hence, uncertainties related to the modeling of hadronic interactions inside the target are no longer relevant; however, uncertainties for interactions outside the target are considered. The uncertainties on the measured replica target multiplicities are estimated by applying the same uncertainties that NA61/SHINE has reported for the thin target multiplicity measurements.",

At that distance, the beamline appears as a line source of neutrinos, compared to a point source seen by Hyper-K, and the far-to-near ratio is not flat. For near detectors placed further away, at, e.g., 1 or 2 km, the far-to-near flux ratio becomes flatter and there is better cancellation of the flux uncertainties between the near and far detectors. Figure 10 shows how the uncertainty on the far-to-near ratio evolves for baselines of 280 m, 1 km, and 2 km. While this extrapolation uncertainty is reduced for near detectors further from the production point, even the 280 m to Hyper-K uncertainty is less than 1% near the flux peak energy of 600 MeV. ",

For anti-neutrino mode samples, an additional overall normalization parameter with 6% prior uncertainty is introduced to account for a possible uncertainty in the anti-neutrino interaction, which is less known experimentally in this energy region. This additional uncertainty is expected to decrease as we accumulate and analyze more anti-neutrino data in T2K, but we conservatively assign the current estimate for this study. A normalization weight 1 + f \u03bd norm is multiplied to N test k in the anti-neutrino mode samples. The penalty term P in Eq. (14) constrains the systematic parameters f i with the normalized covariance matrix C: In order to reduce the number of the systematic parameters, several reconstructed energy bins that have similar covariance values are merged for f i . The size of the systematic uncertainty is evaluated based on the experience and prospects of the T2K experiment, as it provides the most realistic estimate as the baseline. We estimate the systematic uncertainties assuming the T2K neutrino beamline and near detectors, taking into account improvements expected with future T2K running and analysis improvements. For Hyper-K, a further reduction of systematic uncertainties will be possible with upgrade of the beamline and near detectors, improvements in detector calibration and analysis techniques, and improved understanding of neutrino interaction with more measurements. In particular, as described in Sect. 3.2, studies of near detectors are ongoing with a goal of further reducing systematic uncertainties. The sensitivity update is expected in the near future as the near-detector design studies advance.",

The fardetector uncertainty is treated as fully correlated between the neutrino and anti-neutrino running.

With reactor constraints, although the contour becomes narrower in the direction of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 , the sensitivity to \u03b4 C P does not significantly change because \u03b4 C P is constrained by the comparison of neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillation probabilities by Hyper-K and not limited by the uncertainty of \u03b8 13 . Figure 19 shows the expected significance to exclude sin \u03b4 C P = 0 (the C P conserved case).

As a demonstration of such a capability, a study has been done by simply adding \u03c7 2 from two measurements, although in a real experiment a more sophisticated analysis is expected. Assuming the true mass hierarchy of normal hierarchy and the true value of \u03b4 C P = 0, the values of expected \u03c7 2 as a function of \u03b4 C P for each of the accelerator and atmospheric neutrino measurements, without assumption of prior mass hierarchy knowledge, are shown in the top plot of Fig. 26. For the accelerator neutrino measurement, there is a second minimum near \u03b4 C P = 150 \u2022 because of a degeneracy with mass hierarchy assumptions. On the other hand, the atmospheric neutrino measurement can discriminate the mass hierarchy, but the sensitivity to the C P-violating phase \u03b4 C P is worse than the accelerator measurement. By adding the information from both measurements, as shown in the bottom plot of Fig. 26, the fake solution can be eliminated and a precise measurement of \u03b4 C P will be possible.",
