Measurements of the production of top-quark pairs and single top-quarks in different channels, the top-quark mass, the top-quark pair charge asymmetry and spin correlations, and the W helicity fractions in top-quark decays are presented, as well as two searches for new physics effects involving top-quark pairs.",

            "text": "Top-quark measurements are of central importance to the LHC physics programme. The production of top-quark pairs in pp collisions is a process which is situated at the boundary between the Standard Model (SM) and what might lie beyond it. Within the SM, top quarks are predicted to almost always decay to a b-quark and a W -boson, that can further decay leptonically or hadronically. The final states are thus characterised by the presence of two (dilepton), one (single lepton) or no leptons (all hadronic channel). With an integrated luminosity of 0.70 \u2212 1.08fb \u22121 of pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at \u221a s = 7 TeV in the first half of 2011 a variety of precision and new measurement have been obtained.",

            "text": "Within the SM the tt production cross-section at \u221a s = 7 TeV is calculated to be 165 +11 \u221216 pb at approximate NNLO for a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV. A precise determination of \u03c3 tt tests these perturbative QCD predictions. First measurements of \u03c3 tt at the LHC have been reported by ATLAS and CMS with 3 pb \u22121 and 35 pb \u22121 . With approximately twenty times more data the single lepton, dilepton and lepton+\u03c4 channels have been measured. In the single-lepton channel a multivariate likelihood discriminant is constructed using template distributions of four variables [1]. Data are split according to lepton flavour and number of jets. A profile likelihood technique is used to extract \u03c3 tt and constrain the systematic effects from data. The result is \u03c3 tt = 179.0 \u00b1 9.8 (stat.+syst.) \u00b1 6.6 (lumi.) pb, the most precise measurement of \u03c3 tt at LHC to date. In the dilepton channel a cut-andcount method is employed [2]. The background contribution from Drell-Yan production is suppressed by requiring for same-flavour events large E miss T and for e\u00b5 events large H T , the scalar sum of jet and lepton transverse energies. Remaining Drell-Yan events and background from fake leptons are estimated with data-driven methods. The combined cross-section in the three channels is \u03c3 tt = 171 \u00b1 6 (stat.) +16 \u221214 (syst.) \u00b1 8 (lumi.) pb. A second measurement requiring at least one b-jet yields a consistent result. A cross-section measurement is also performed in final states with an isolated muon and a hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton [3]. At least two jets, one of them b-tagged, are required. The analysis utilises a multivariate technique based on boosted decision trees to identify \u03c4 -leptons and extracts \u03c3 tt = 142 \u00b1 21 (stat.) +20 \u221216 (syst.) \u00b1 5 (lumi.) pb. ",

Combining the electron and muon channels and the results from the 2010 ATLAS data, the top-quark mass is measured to be m top = 175.9 \u00b1 0.9 (stat.) \u00b1 . The spin information is accessed via the angular distributions of its decay products. The difference in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons is compared to the expected distributions in the SM, and to the case where the top quarks are produced with uncorrelated spin. Using the helicity basis as the quantisation axis, the strength of the spin correlation between the top and antitop quark is measured to be A helicity = 0.34 +0.15 \u22120.11 , which is in agreement with the NLO SM prediction. Helicities of W -bosons in top-quark decays have been measured in the single-and di-lepton channels [10]. At least one of the jets in the single-lepton final state is required to be b-tagged. The results are in agreement with the SM. As the polarisation of the W -bosons in top-quark decays is sensitive to the structure of the W tb-vertex the measurements are used to set limits on anomalous contributions to the W tb-vertex.    ",

The results are interpreted in terms of a model where new top-quark partners are pair-produced and each decay to a top quark and a long-lived undetected neutral particle. The data are found to be consistent with SM expectations. A limit at 95% C.L. is set excluding a cross-section times branching ratio of 1.1 pb for a top-partner mass of 420 GeV and a neutral particle mass less than 10 GeV. In a search for high mass tt resonances in the dilepton channel [12] no excess above the SM expectation is observed. Upper limits at the 95% C.L are set on the cross-section times branching ratio of the resonance decaying to tt pairs as a function of the resonance pole mass. A lower mass limit of 0.84 TeV is set for the case of a Kaluza-Klein gluon resonance in the Randall-Sundrum Model.  ",
