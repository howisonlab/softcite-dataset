The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.7 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The W bosons are identified by their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The charm quarks are tagged via the full reconstruction of D * (2010) \u00b1 mesons that decay via D * (2010) \u00b1 \u2192 D 0 + \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 K \u2213 + \u03c0 \u00b1 + \u03c0 \u00b1 . A cross section is measured in the fiducial region defined by the muon transverse momentum p \u03bc T > 26 GeV, muon pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u03bc | < 2.4, and charm quark transverse momentum p c T > 5 GeV. The inclusive cross section for this kinematic range is \u03c3 (W + c) = 1026 \u00b1 31 (stat) +76 \u221272 (syst) pb. The cross section is also measured differentially as a function of the pseudorapidity of the muon from the W boson decay. These measurements are compared with theoretical predictions and are used to probe the strange quark content of the proton.",

            "text": "Precise knowledge of the structure of the proton, expressed in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), is important for interpreting results obtained in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. The PDFs are determined by comparing theoretical predictions obtained at a particular order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) to experimental measurements. The precision of the PDFs, which affects the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for cross sections at the LHC, is determined by the uncertainties of the experimental measurements used, and by the limitations of the available theoretical calculations. The flavor composition of the light quark sea in the proton and, in particular, the understanding of the strange quark distribution is important for the measurement of the W boson mass at the LHC [1]. Therefore, it is of great interest to determine the strange quark distribution with improved precision. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch Before the start of LHC data taking, information on the strange quark content of the nucleon was obtained primarily from charm production in (anti)neutrino-iron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) by the NuTeV [2], CCFR [3], and NOMAD [4] experiments. In addition, a direct measurement of inclusive charm production in nuclear emulsions was performed by the CHORUS experiment [5]. At the LHC, the production of W or Z bosons, inclusive or associated with charm quarks, provides an important input for tests of the earlier determinations of the strange quark distribution. The measurements of inclusive W or Z boson production at the LHC, which are indirectly sensitive to the strange quark distribution, were used in a QCD analysis by the ATLAS experiment, and an enhancement of the strange quark distribution with respect to other measurements was observed [6].",

The contribution of the Cabibbo-suppressed processes g + d \u2192 W + +c and g + d \u2192 W \u2212 +c amounts to only a few percent of the total cross section.

            "text": "Production of W+c in hadron collisions was first investigated at the Tevatron [7][8][9]. The first measurement of the cross section of W+c production in pp collisions at the LHC was performed by the CMS Collaboration at a center-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 [10]. This measurement was used for the first direct determination of the strange quark distribution in the proton at a hadron collider [11]. The extracted strangeness suppression with respect to u and d quark densities was found to be in agreement with measurements in neutrino scattering experiments. The cross section for W+c production was also mea- and used in a QCD analysis, which supported the enhanced strange quark content in the proton suggested by the earlier ATLAS analysis [6]. A subsequent joint QCD analysis [13] of all available data that were sensitive to the strange quark distribution demonstrated consistency between the W+c measurements by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. In Ref. [13], possible reasons for the observed strangeness enhancement were discussed. Recent results of an ATLAS QCD analysis [14], including measurements of inclusive W and Z boson production at \u221a s = 7 TeV, indicated an even stronger strangeness enhancement in disagreement with all global PDFs. In Ref. [15], possible reasons for this observation were attributed to the limitations of the parameterization used in this ATLAS analysis [14]. The associated production of a W boson with a jet originating from a charm quark is also studied in the forward region by the LHCb experiment [16].",

The pion originating from the D * (2010) \u00b1 decay receives very little energy because of the small mass difference between D * (2010) \u00b1 and D 0 (1865) and is therefore denoted a \"slow\" pion \u03c0 \u00b1 slow . Cross sections for W+D * (2010) \u00b1 production are measured within a selected fiducial phase space. The W+c cross sections are compared with theoretical predictions at next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD, which are obtained with mcfm 6.8 [17][18][19], and are used to extract the strange quark content of the proton. This paper is organized as follows. The CMS detector is briefly described in Sect. 2. The data and the simulated samples are described in Sect. 3. The event selection is presented in Sect. 4. The measurement of the cross sections and the evaluation of systematic uncertainties are discussed in Sect. 5. The details of the QCD analysis are described in Sect. 6.

Similarly to the earlier analysis [11], the mass of the charm quark is chosen to be m c = 1.5 GeV, and the factorization and the renormalization scales are set to the value of the W boson mass. The calculation is performed for p \u03bc T > 26 GeV, |\u03b7 \u03bc | < 2.4, and p c T > 5 GeV. In Fig. 4, the measurements of the inclusive W+c cross section and the   neutrino-nucleon DIS collected by the NOMAD and CHO-RUS experiments in order to improve the constraints on the strange quark distribution and to perform a detailed study of the isospin asymmetry of the light quarks in the proton sea [56]. Despite differences in the data used in the individual global PDF fits, the strangeness suppression distributions in ABMP16nlo, NNPDF3.1nlo, CT14nlo and MMHT14nlo are in a good agreement among each other and disagree with the ATLASepWZ16nnlo result [14]. The predicted inclusive cross sections are summarized in Table 4. The PDF uncertainties are calculated using prescriptions from each PDF group. For the ATLASepWZ16nnlo PDFs no respective NLO set is available and only Hessian uncertainties are considered in this paper. For other PDFs, the variation of \u03b1 s (m Z ) is taken into account as well. The uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are estimated by varying \u03bc r and \u03bc f simultaneously by a factor of 2 up and down, and the resulting variation of the cross section is referred to as the scale uncertainty, \u0394\u03bc. Good agreement between NLO predictions and the measurements is observed, except for the prediction using ATLASepWZ16nnlo. For the cross section ratio \u03c3 (W + +c)/\u03c3 (W \u2212 +c), all theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the measured value. In Table 5, the theoretical predictions for d\u03c3 (W+c)/d|\u03b7 \u03bc | using different PDF sets are summarized. In Fig. 5, the measurements of differential W+c and W+D * (2010) \u00b1 cross sections are compared with the mcfm NLO calculations and with the signal MC prediction, respectively. Good agreement between the measured W+c cross section and NLO calculations is observed except for the prediction using the ATLASepWZ16nnlo PDF set. The signal MC prediction using NNPDF3.0nlo is presented with the PDF and \u03b1 s uncertainties and accounts for simultaneous variations of \u03bc r and \u03bc f in the matrix element by a factor of 2. The W+D * (2010) \u00b1 cross section is described well by the simulation.",

The first measurement of a fiducial W+c cross section in pp collisions was performed by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV with a total integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 [11]. The results were used in a QCD analysis [10] together with measurements of neutral-and charged-current cross sections of DIS at HERA [57] and of the lepton charge asymmetry in W production at \u221a s = 7 TeV at the LHC [11]. The present measurement of the W+c production cross section at 13 TeV, determined as a function of the absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u03bc | of the muon from the W boson decay and p \u03bc T > 26 GeV, is used in an NLO QCD analysis. This analysis also includes an updated combination of the inclusive DIS cross sections [58] and the available CMS measurements of the lepton charge asymmetry in W boson production at \u221a s = 7 TeV [11] and at \u221a s = 8 TeV [59]. These latter measurements probe the valence quark distributions  in the kinematic range 10 \u22123 \u2264 x \u2264 10 \u22121 and have indirect sensitivity to the strange quark distribution. The earlier CMS measurement [10] of W+c production at \u221a s = 7 TeV is also used to exploit the strange quark sensitive measurements at CMS in a joint QCD analysis. The correlations of the experimental uncertainties within each individual data set are taken into account, whereas the CMS data sets are treated as uncorrelated to each other. In particular, the measurements of W+c production at 7 and 13 TeV are treated as uncorre-lated because of the different methods of charm tagging and the differences in reconstruction and event selection in the two data sets.",

The renormalization and factorization scales are set to Q, which denotes the four-momentum transfer for the case of the DIS data and the mass of the W boson for the case of the muon charge asymmetry and the W+c measurement. The strong coupling constant is set to \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.118. The Q 2 range of HERA data is restricted to Q 2 \u2265 Q 2 min = 3.5 GeV 2 to ensure the applicability of pQCD over the kinematic range of the fit. The procedure for the determination of the PDFs follows the approach used in the earlier CMS analyses [11,59]. In the following, a similar PDF parameterization is used as in the most recent CMS QCD analysis [59] of inclusive W boson production.",

The experimental PDF uncertainties arising from the uncertainties in the measurements are estimated by using the Hessian method [72], adopting the tolerance criterion of \u0394\u03c7 2 = 1. The experimental uncertainties correspond to 68% confidence level. Alternatively, the experimental uncertainties in the measurements are propagated to the extracted QCD fit parameters using the MC method [73,74]. In this method, 426 replicas of pseudodata are generated, with measured values for the cross sections allowed to vary within the statistical and systematic uncertainties. For each of them, the PDF fit is performed and the uncertainty is estimated as the root-mean-square around the central value. Because of possible nonGaussian tails in the PDF uncertainties, the MC method is usually considered to be more robust and to give more realistic uncertainties, in particular for PDFs not strongly constrained by the measurements, e.g., in the case of too little or not very precise data. In Fig. 6, the distributions of the strange quark content s(x, Q 2 ), and of the strangeness suppression factor r s (x, \u03bc 2 f ) = (s + s)/(u + d) are presented. In Fig. 7 the strangeness suppression factor is shown in comparison with the ATLASepWZ16nnlo and the ABMP16nlo, similar to Fig. 1 in Ref. [15]. Whereas the CMS result for r s (x) is close to the ABMP16nlo PDF, it shows a significant difference with regard to the ATLASepWZ16nnlo PDF for x > 10 \u22123 . The significant excess of the strange quark content in the proton reported by ATLAS [14] is not observed in the present analysis.",

The W boson is detected via the presence of a highp T muon and missing transverse momentum, suggesting the presence of a neutrino. The charm quark is identified via the full reconstruction of the D * (2010) \u00b1 meson decaying to D 0 + \u03c0 \u00b1 slow \u2192 K \u2213 + \u03c0 \u00b1 + \u03c0 \u00b1 slow . Since in W+c production the W boson and the c quark have opposite charge, contributions from background processes, mainly c quark production from gluon splitting, are largely removed by subtracting the events in which the charges of the W boson and of the D * (2010) \u00b1 meson have the same sign. The fiducial cross sections are measured in the kinematic range of the muon transverse momentum p The obtained values for the inclusive fiducial W+c cross section and for the cross section ratio are: \u03c3 (W+c) = 1026 \u00b1 31 (stat) +76 \u221272 (syst) pb,",

To illustrate the impact of these measurements in the determination of the strange quark distribution in the proton, the data is used in a QCD analysis at NLO together with inclusive DIS measurements and earlier results from CMS on W+c production and the lepton charge asymmetry in W boson production. The strange quark distribution and the strangeness suppression factor r s (x, \u03bc 2 f ) = (s + s)/(u + d) are determined and agree with earlier results obtained in neutrino scattering experiments.
