We also study the fluctuations arising from the low event statistics and their effect on the precision measurements and mass-hierarchy analysis for a 5-year exposure of the 50 kton ICAL detector. We find a mean resolution of \u0394\u03c7 2 \u2248 2.9, which rules out the wrong mass hierarchy of the neutrinos with a significance of approximately 1.7\u03c3 . These results on mass-hierarchy are similar to those presented in earlier studies that approximated the performance of the ICAL detector.",

A series of experiments dedicated to neutrinos [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] have proved the existence of neutrino flavour oscillations, which implies that neutrinos are massive. The neutrino flavour states produced along with charged leptons are linear superpositions of the mass eigenstates. Due to the difference in phase between the wave packets of each of the mass eigenstates, neutrino oscillations occur [10,11].",

            "text": "The mixing angle \u03b8 13 is found to be non-zero from reactor [6,8,9] and accelerator [15,16] neutrino oscillation experiments. The relatively large value of \u03b8 13 \u223c = 8.6 \u2022 has intensified the search for C P violation effects in neutrino oscillations, and also the determination of the sign of \u0394m 2 32 via matter effects [17,18]. Matter plays an important role in enhancing the effect of sin \u03b8 13 via resonance, which is sensitive to the sign of \u0394m 2 32 and is different for neutrinos and antineutrinos [19,20]. Determination of the sign of \u0394m 2 32 would help us understand the correct mass hierarchy (MH) of the neutrinos, i.e., whether the MH is (m 1 < m 2 < m 3 ) normal (NH) or (m 3 < m 1 < m 2 ) inverted (IH) hierarchy. A series of experiments with complementary approaches have been proposed using accelerator, reactor and atmospheric neutrinos to determine the MH [21,22]. The intermediate and long baseline, off-axis accelerator neutrino experiments T2K [5] and NO\u03bdA [23,24], search for the appearance of \u03bd e in an intense beam of \u03bd \u03bc , wherein the appearance probability depends on the MH of the neutrino states. Recent results from NO\u03bdA [25] have disfavoured the IH by more than 93% C.L. in the lower octant for all values of CP phase \u03b4, and it is in good agreement with the T2K result [26] giving a near maximal value of \u03b8 23 and a weak preference of NH. Liquid scintillator detectors proposed at RENO-50 [8] and JUNO [27] could unravel the MH using reactor neutrinos. Atmospheric neutrino experiments using water or ice Cherenkov detectors, such as Hyper-K [28,29], MEMPHYS [30], ORCA and PINGU [31,32], make use of different cross-sections and different \u03bd and\u03bd fluxes to study the MH.",

Later the generated data is folded with the detector efficiencies and smeared by the resolution functions within the lookup table. Hence, the previous methods used parameterizations of the efficiency and resolution that do not reflect the tails of these distributions. As well as those methods used very large sample sizes to negate the effect of low statistics. We also apply a few event selection criteria, as presented in Ref.

Hence the measured data is digitized to form (x, z) or (y, z) and time t of the signal, referred to as hits. Here the z position is given by the layer number of the RPC. A recursive optimal state estimator -the Kalman Filter [39,40], uses the local geometry and magnetic field information to fit the muon hits, where the muons passing through a minimum of three layers are fit to form the track. The direction and the momentum of the muon is obtained from the best fit values of the track. Also the timing information from the RPCs, with a resolution of approximately 1 ns enables the distinction between upward and downward going particles. More details can be found in Ref. [40]. Hence for the first time we have done this analysis performing event-by-event reconstruction, where each event is simulated through the detector and reconstructed to obtain the observables.

At higher energies the reconstruction efficiencies become almost a constant. The resolution improves considerably at low and high energies with the selection of events. An overall improvement of 23% and 19% is noticed in energy and zenith angle resolution of muons (averaged over muon energy, zenith and azimuthal angles) after the event selection.

The events with negative and positive Q \u03bc E \u03bc indicate those identified as \u03bd \u03bc and\u03bd \u03bc events respectively. The atmospheric neutrino flux falls rapidly at higher energies. Hence, wider bins were chosen in those energy regions to ensure adequate statistics. Also, within the frame work of low event statistics, increasing the number of high energy bins is not feasible due to the limited statistics.

Hence, the rest of the analysis in this paper mainly focus on the fits and the effects of fluctuations without event selection.",

The process of scaling nullifies the effect of fluctuations so that the best-fit is always close to the input value. Then the parameter sensitivities are to be understood as the median value when averaged over a large number of randomly generated samples. In order to see this, we generate an unfluctuated 5 year sample by scaling the 1000 year set and a similar analysis is performed as in Sect. 3. The comparison of \u0394\u03c7 2 with (WF) and without (WOF) fluctuations is shown as a function of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and |\u0394m 2 32 | in Fig. 8a, b respectively.

Also the uncertainties in the parameter determination changes along with the significance of convergence, with each independent fluctuated pseudo-data set. The correlated precision is also observed to change with each fluctuated data set, where they show different coverages in sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u2212 \u0394m 2 32 plane. The analysis was repeated for sixty different fluctuated data sets, performing separate (one parameter) and simulta-neous (two parameter) fits to determine sin 2 \u03b8 23 and |\u0394m 2 32 |. Figure 9 shows the significance of convergence in terms of standard deviation \u03c3 . Almost 68% of times, the fit to sin 2 \u03b8 23 converges within 1\u03c3 of the input value sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.5. A similar trend is observed in the fit to \u0394m 2 32 , where 59% of times it converges within 1\u03c3 of the input value \u0394m 2 32 = 2.32 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 . Also 95% of the time the fit converges within 2\u03c3 , which evidently shows the Gaussian nature of the fit. The simultaneous fit to sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 also shows a similar behaviour in significance. Figure 10 shows the average coverage area with 99% CL in sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u2212 \u0394m 2 32 plane, obtained by averaging the coverages from simultaneous fit to fifty different pseudo-data sets. The orange band signifies the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in calculating the average, where the asymmetrical widths from the best fit point of each data set were used. The precision reach for the fit without fluctuations is within 1\u03c3 of the average coverage area calculated.",

Figure 12b shows the distribution of \u0394\u03c7 2 MH obtained from the fit to sixty different sets. The mean resolution of \u0394\u03c7 2 MH = 2.9 rules out the wrong hierarchy with a significance of \u2248 1.7\u03c3 for a 5 year run of 50 kton ICAL detector. The large uncertainty in \u0394\u03c7 2 MH is due to the fluctuations in the data and the negative values signifies the identification of the wrong mass hierarchy. Note that an earlier analysis that excluded the effect of fluctuations [47] gave a value \u0394\u03c7 2 MH = 2.7 and our mean value is compatible with this, as expected, given minor differences in the analysis procedures. A 13 year exposure of ICAL will give a 3\u03c3 separation to differentiate the correct MH. The classical statistical analysis used here is the same as that in the earlier works by the INO collaboration hence allowing a direct comparison. However, using a Bayesian approach [50] could improve the hierarchy sensitivity.",

The constraints on sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 are compared with and without event selection criterion. Statistically we lose 40% of events after selection, hence we find large uncertainty in parameter determination after applying event selection. We use an ensemble of independent fluctuated data sets to study the effect of low event statistics on the precision measurements of the oscillation parameters. The constraints on sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 are compared with and without fluctuations, and we find a reasonable agreement between the unfluctuated and the average fluctuated precision reach obtained in sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u2212 \u0394m 2 32 plane. As far as the mass hierarchy of the neutrinos is concerned, we find a mean resolution of \u0394\u03c7 2 M H = 2.9 from an ensemble of sixty experiments. This rules out the wrong hierarchy with a significance of \u2248 1.7\u03c3 , consistent with earlier analysis obtained without considering fluctuations. We also find a significant deviation in the mean value of \u0394\u03c7 2 M H , and roughly a 15% probability of obtaining the wrong hierarchy due to the fluctuations in the data. In the near future, combining the CP independent measurements at ICAL with the measurements from NO\u03bdA, T2K and other reactor experiments, will help to determine the correct MH [22,51].",

The ICAL can also measure the hadron energy via proper calibration of hits, and including the hadron energy information in CC events is expected to improve the sensitivity of the detector towards the oscillation parameters and also improve the MH significance [44]. Note that there are CC \u03bd e as well as neutral current (NC) events in the detector. Separation of \u03bd \u03bc CC events from the others is quite robust for E \u03bc 1GeV and has been discussed elsewhere [33]. Separation of low energy CC \u03bd \u03bc events from CC \u03bd e and NC events is an ongoing effort of the INO-ICAL collaboration. A combined analysis including all the CC events along with the hadron information will give us the maximum sensitivity the ICAL can attain, and is likely to improve the results presented in this paper.",
