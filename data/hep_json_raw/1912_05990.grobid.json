The K S mesons are identified by the interaction of K L mesons in the detector. The K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd decays are selected by a boosted decision tree built with kinematic variables and by a time-of-flight measurement. Signal efficiencies are evaluated with data control samples of K L \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd decays. A fit to the reconstructed muon mass distribution finds 7223 \u00b1 180 signal events. Normalising to the K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay events the result for the branching fraction is B(K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd) = (4.56 \u00b1 0.11 stat \u00b1 0.17 syst ) \u00d7",

            "text": "The branching fraction for semileptonic decays of charged and neutral kaons together with the lifetime measurements are used to determine the |V us | element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. The relation among the matrix elements of the first row, |V ud | 2 + |V us | 2 + |V ub | 2 = 1, provides the most stringent test of the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix. Different factors contribute to the uncertainty in determining |V us | from kaon decays [1][2][3] and among the six semileptonic decays the contribution of the lifetime uncertainty is smallest for the K S meson. Nevertheless, given the lack of pure high-intensity K S meson beams contrary to the case of K \u00b1 and K L mesons, the K S \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd decay provides the least precise determination of |V us |, and the branching fraction B(K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd) has not yet been measured. Measurement of this decay mode allows an independent determination of |V us | and to extend the test of lepton-flavour universality to K S semileptonic decays by comparison with the expected value of (4.69 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [4] derived from B(K S \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd).",

DA NE [5] is an electron-positron collider running at the centre-of-mass energy of 1.02 GeV colliding e + and e \u2212 beams at an angle of \u03c0 \u22120.025 rad and with a bunch-crossing period of 2.71 ns. The \u03c6 mesons are produced with a small transverse momentum of 13 MeV and K L -K S pairs are produced almost back-to-back with a cross section times the \u03c6 \u2192 K L K S branching fraction of about 1 \u03bcb. The beam energy, the energy spread, the beams transverse momentum and the position of the interaction point are measured using Bhabha scattering events [6]. The K S (K L ) mesons are identified (tagged) by the observation of a K L (K S ) meson in the opposite hemisphere. This tagging procedure allows the selection efficiency for K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd to be evaluated with good accuracy using a sample of the abundant decay K L \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd tagged by the detection of K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. The branching fraction is extracted normalising the number of K S \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd events to the number of K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events recorded in the same dataset.",

The readout granularity is 4.4 \u00d7 4.4 cm 2 , for a total of 2440 cells arranged in five layers. Each cell is read out at both ends by photomultipliers. The energy deposits are obtained from signal amplitudes while the arrival time and the position along the fibres are obtained from time differences between the two signals. Cells close in time and space are grouped into energy clusters. The cluster energy E is the sum of the cell energies, the cluster time and position are energy-weighted averages. Energy and time resolutions are \u03c3 E /E = 0.057/ E (GeV) and \u03c3 t = 54 ps/ E (GeV) \u2295 100 ps, respectively. The cluster spatial resolution is \u03c3 = 1.4 cm/ E (GeV) along the fibres and \u03c3 \u22a5 = 1.3 cm in the orthogonal direction. The first-level trigger [10] uses both the calorimeter and the drift chamber information; the calorimeter trigger requires two energy deposits with E > 50 MeV in the barrel and E > 150 MeV in the endcaps; the drift chamber trigger is based on the number and topology of hit drift cells. A second-level cosmic-ray veto rejects events with at least two energy deposits above 30 MeV in the outermost calorimeter layer. The trigger time is determined by the first particle reaching the calorimeter and is synchronised with the DA NE radio frequency signal. The time interval between bunch crossings is smaller than the time spread of the signals produced by the particles, thus the time of the bunch crossing originating the event, T 0 , is determined after event reconstruction and all the times related to that event are shifted accordingly. Data for reconstruction are selected by an on-line filter [11] to reject beam backgrounds. The filter also records the events into different output files for analysis according to their properties and topology (event classification), 5% of the events are recorded without applying the filter to control the efficiency of the event classification.",

The analysis is repeated varying the \u03b4t \u03c0\u03c0 lower cut in the range 0.5-1.25 ns, the rms value of the differences corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 3.0%. This is the main systematic uncertainty affecting the measurement. The fit to the m \u03bc 2 distribution in",
