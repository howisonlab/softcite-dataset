Since the value predicted by the SM is very precise, any significant deviation of the measured value from this prediction would be particularly interesting, as it would indicate a possible contribution of new, unknown particles to the loop diagrams describing B 0 s mixing.

The weak phase \u03c6 s was first measured by the Tevatron experiments [5][6][7][8], and then at the LHC by the LHCb and ATLAS experiments [9-13], using B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6(1020), B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 f 0 (980), and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays to + \u2212 h + h \u2212 , where denotes a muon in the present analysis and h stands for a kaon or a pion.

For the B 0 s signal generation, the evtpvvcplh module is used, which simulates the double vector decay taking into account neutral meson mixing and CP-violating time-dependent asymmetries. Final-state radiation is included in evtgen through the photos package [24,25]. The events are then passed through a detailed Geant4-based simulation [26] of the CMS detector. The predicted distributions from simulation of many kinematic and geometric variables are compared to those from data and found to be in agreement. The simulated samples are used to determine the signal reconstruction efficiencies, and to study the background components in the B 0 s signal mass window. The main background for the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6(1020) decays originates from nonprompt J/\u03c8 mesons from the decay of B hadrons, such as B 0 , B \u00b1 , b , and B c . Since the B c cross section is small [21] compared to that of the B 0 s [21], the B c decays can be neglected.",

The term \u03b5 tag is the tagging efficiency, defined as the fraction of events to which a tag decision is found by the tagging algorithm. Opposite-side muons and electrons are reconstructed with the particle-flow algorithm [27,28]. In each event, the muons (electrons) that are not part of the reconstructed B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6(1020) decay are required to be identified with loose identification criteria. If there are multiple muons (electrons) in the event, the one with the highest p T is chosen at this stage. The tag lepton selections are then optimised separately for muons and electrons using simulated signal samples of B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6(1020) decays. A cut-based opposite-side lepton selection is applied to reduce the number of leptons not originating from B-hadron decays. To optimise the selection, several variables are studied, and a set of five discrim-inating variables (p T , \u03b7, d xyz , R, Isolation) is identified. A total number of more than four million alternative cut configurations have been tested to determine the configuration that maximises the tagging power, independently for muons and electrons. The tag muon is thus required to have p T > 2.2 GeV, the 3D impact parameter d xyz with respect to the primary vertex associated with the signal B 0 s is required to be smaller than 0.1 cm, and the an- In addition, a multivariate discriminator (MVA e\u2212\u03c0 ) tuned to separate genuine electrons reconstructed by the particle-flow algorithm from pions and photons is applied to tag electrons by requiring that the discriminator is greater than 0.2 [28]. A multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) of the TMVA toolkit [29] is used to further separate the right-and wrong-tag leptons. Training and testing is performed using approximately 24 000 and 20 400 simulated B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6(1020) events for the muon and electron MLP-NNs, respectively, and two independently optimised sets of variables. Half of each sample is used for training and the other half for testing. The input variables common to both MLP-NNs are p T , \u03b7, and d xyz of the tag lepton, and two variables related to activity in a cone around the lepton direction: a particle-flow relative isolation variable [28] and a p T -weighted average of the charges of the particles in the cone. Specific variables are further introduced in the MLP-NNs separately for muons and electrons. For muons, the p T relative to the axis of the jet containing the muon is used, while for electrons the MVA e\u2212\u03c0 is exploited.",
