            "text": "Neutrino oscillation due to neutrino mass eigenstate mixing has become a well established theory accounting for the solar, atmospheric, long-baseline and reactor neutrino experimental observations in recent years [1]. In the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix, we currently have relatively good knowledge of the values of \u03b8 12 and \u03b8 23 from solar, long-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, atmospheric and long-baseline accelerator neutrino beam experiments. However, we still have limited knowledge about the third neutrino mixing angle, \u03b8 13 . The current best direct experimental limit, from the Chooz experiment, indicates that sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.20 at 90% confidence level (C.L.) assuming \u2206m 2 32 = 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 [2]. The Palo Verde experiment established an upper bound of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.4 assuming the same \u2206m 2 32 value [3]. We currently have no measurements of the Dirac CP phase \u03b4 in the mixing matrix since \u03b8 13 value is not known. The value of \u03b8 13 is also essential for the planning of next generation long baseline neutrino experiments [4].",

            "text": "The unknown third mixing angle \u03b8 13 in the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix is the gateway to CP physics in lepton sector and the planning of next generation long baseline neutrino experiments greatly depends on its value. Using the six 2.9 GW th reactor cores at the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, China, the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment deploys eight \"identical\" detectors at three experimental sites. The near-far arrangement of these eight \"identical\" detectors cancels the correlated uncertainties in reactor antineutrino fluxes and antineutrino detectors. The Daya Bay design makes swapping ADs a possible option. With baseline systematic uncertainties, the Daya Bay experiment can reach a sensitivity of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 to < 0.01 with 3 years of data taking. Ongoing R&D and the optional swapping can further improve the sensitivity.",

            "text": "the Daya Bay AD adopts a 3-zone design. The inner-most region is the target zone defined by a 3 m diameter and 3 m tall acrylic vessel (AV), filled with 20 t 0.1% Gd doped liquid scintillator LAB (linear alkaline benzene). Surrounding the target zone, 20 t undoped liquid scintillator LAB, held by a 4 m diameter 4 m tall acrylic cylinder, functions as the gamma catcher, i.e. to catch the gammas from the reactions inside the target zone. Outside the gamma catcher, a 5 m diameter 5 m tall stainless steel tank holds mineral oil, 192 PMTs, top and bottom reflectors, radial shields and other supporting structures. The 192 PMTs plus the top and bottom reflectors provide \u223c12% effective photocathode coverage. On the top of each AD, there are 3 overflow tanks to accommodate any expansions or contractions of corresponding liquids due to temperature changes and potential deformations during transportation. Three automatic calibration units (ACU) are also placed on the top of the AD.The ADs detect antineutrinos via IBD reactions,\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n. A 1 MeV cut is chosen to select the prompt positron signal. The final state neutron in the target zone has an \u223c85% chance of being captured by a Gd atom in \u223c28 \u00b5s. The excited Gd atom goes back to ground state by emitting gammas with a total energy of \u223c8 MeV. A 6 MeV cut is chosen to select the time correlated neutron. The two cut values are established by the calibration system. ACUs are instrumented with 3 calibration sources: 68 Ge to provide positrons, 60 Co and 241 Am + 13 C to provide 2.5 MeV gammas and \u223c4 MeV neutrons, and a LED diffuser ball to provide signals to calibrate PMT gains and timing.",
