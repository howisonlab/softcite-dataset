The beam has been optimized to maximize the number of \u03c4 events in the detector (convolution of the neutrino flux, the appearance probability and the detection efficiency). The neutrino average energy is 17 GeV. Measured in the number of interactions in the detector, the\u03bd \u00b5 contamination is \u223c 2%, the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) is < 1% and the number of prompt \u03bd \u03c4 is negligible. The beam configuration starts from the SPS protons directed to the target chamber where mainly pions and kaons are produced, which decay then into a 1km long decay tunnel followed by hadron stops and muon detectors. From CERN to Gran Sasso the escaping neutrinos travel for 2.44 ms and their mean direction w.r.t. the horizontal in Gran Sasso forms a 3 \u2022 angle due to the earth curvature. There are two fast extractions separated by 50 ms in each CNGS cycle (6s long). These cycles are repeated 3 or 4 times during each SPS supercycle. The nomimal beam intensity is 4.5 \u2022 10 19 pot /year. The so far achieved performance in 2008 and 2009 is respectively 1.78 19 and 2.4 19 pot (Fig. 1).",

The events induced by the shortlived \u03c4 have a characteristic topology (with a \"kink\" due to the presence of undetected neutrinos in the \u03c4 decay) but extends over \u223c mm 3 typical volumes. The detector should therefore match a large mass for statistics, a high spatial resolution and high rejection power to limit background contamination. These requirements are satisfied using the proven ECC (Emulsion Cloud Chamber) technique which already worked successfully in the DONUT experiment. 16 The passive target consists of lead plates. Particles are tracked in nuclear emulsions films with a sub-micrometric intrinsic resolution. 57 emulsions films are assembled and interspaced with 56 lead plates 1 mm wide in a detector basic cell called \"brick\". An additional doublet of emulsion film (Changeable Sheets, CS) is attached on the downstream face of each brick to guide the tracks predictions inside the brick itself. A brick is a 12.7 \u00d7 10.2 cm 2 object with a thickness along the beam direction of 7.5 cm (about 10 radiation lengths). Bricks are assembled in 31 walls (52 \u00d7 64 bricks) separated by electronic detectors planes to trigger the event and identify the brick with the interaction vertex. The total OPERA target contains 150000 bricks with a total mass of 1.25 ktons. The ECC bricks were assembled underground at an average rate of 700 per day by a dedicated fully automated Brick Assembly Machine (BAM); the OPERA target was filled using two automated manipulator systems (BMS). The passage of a m.i.p. in an emulsion film results, after development, in a set of aligned grains, 35 grains /100\u00b5m.",

CS films are scanned looking for tracks in an area of about 50 cm 2 around the TT prediction. The CS-to-TT connection is made with an accuracy of 1 cm in position and 20 mrad in angle. If tracks from the CS scanning are compatible with those reconstructed in the electronic detectors the brick is brought to the surface laboratory and exposed to cosmic rays in a dedicated pit in order to provide straight tracks for a finer (sub-micrometric) film-to-film alignment. Brick emulsion films are then developed and dispatched to the scanning laboratories to be analysed. All tracks reconstructed in the CS are sought in the most downstream films of the brick with an accuracy of about 70 \u00b5m in position and 10 mrad in angle. Confirmed tracks are followed back along the brick. A stopping point is a signature either of a primary or a secondary vertex. Vertex confirmation is made by scanning a volume of 1 cm 2 transverse size for 11 films located upstream and downstream of the stopping point. All tracks originating inside the volume are input for a vertex reconstruction algorithm which is tuned to find also decay topologies. The tracks attached to the primary vertex are followed downstream to check whether they show any decay topology and to measure their momentum from their Coulomb multiple scattering. ",

Among them the distributions of the impact parameters for the tracks wrt the primary vertex are important. Fig. 6 (left) displays an example of IP measurements for gammas attached to primary or secondary vertices. Another crucial point is the decay search and the charm production analysis. First of all because charm decays exhibit the same topology as \u03c4 decays, therefore measuring the charm-like event reconstruction efficiency provides an important cross-check of the \u03c4 event reconstruction capability. Furthermore charm events are a potential source of background, in particular if the muon at the primary vertex is not identified. Therefore, searching for charm-decays in events with the primary muon correctly identified provides a direct measurement of this background. Charm decay topologies are searched for in the sample of located neutrino interactions (Fig. 6, right panel). At present a set of 15 charm candidates  has been identified and is deeply studied. A new systematic decay search procedure has been recently endorsed and is being applied to increase the understanding of that important data sample. A constant effort is brought on test beam programmes to validate the kinematics measurement by Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS). Tests with pion beams of different energies gave a good data/MC agreement showing the validity of the procedure (Fig. 7) ",

The large data set recorded and under analysis allows a constant and systematic improvement of the detection procedures and efficiencies. Important data samples such as the charm decays are carefully studied since they provide crucial information in the \u03c4 appearance hunting.
