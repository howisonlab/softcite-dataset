The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 38.6 fb \u22121 . They are combined with the data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb \u22121 , respectively. All observations are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson.",

It has been established that the spin-parity quantum numbers of the H boson are consistent with J P C = 0 ++ [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18].

That study focused on testing for the presence of anomalous effects in HZZ, HZ\u03b3 , H\u03b3 \u03b3 , and HWW interactions under spin-zero, -one, and -two hypotheses. The spinone hypotheses were excluded at greater than 99.999% confidence level (CL) in the ZZ and WW modes; they were also excluded via the Landau-Yang theorem [37,38] by the observation of the \u03b3 \u03b3 E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. decay mode with 5.7\u03c3 significance. The spin-two boson hypothesis with gravity-like minimal couplings was excluded at 99.87% CL, and nine other possible hypotheses of spin-two tensor structure of HVV interactions were excluded at 99% CL or higher. Given the exclusion of the spin-one and -two scenarios, constraints were set on the contribution of eleven anomalous couplings to the HZZ, HZ\u03b3 , H\u03b3 \u03b3 , and HWW interactions under the hypothesis of a spinzero state. Among others, these results constrained a CP-violation parameter f a3 , the fractional pseudoscalar cross section in the H \u2192 ZZ channel, which will be described in more detail in Section 2. The pure pseudoscalar hypothesis was excluded at 99.98% CL, and the limit f a3 < 0.43 was set at 95% CL. Similar results, for a smaller number of parameters and fewer exotic-spin models, were obtained by ATLAS [17].",

Nonetheless, both CMS [14] and ATLAS [18] performed analyses of anomalous HVV interactions in VH and VBF production, respectively. Finally, the CMS experiment searched for anomalous HVV interactions in off-shell production of the H boson in pp \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ with Run 1 data [15]. Further measurements probing the tensor structure of the HVV and Hff interactions can test CP invariance and, more generally, any small anomalous contributions [39].",

The H boson coupling to fermions is assumed not to be mediated by a new heavy state V , generating the so-called contact terms [35,36]. We therefore study the process H \u2192 VV \u2192 4f and the equivalent processes in production, rather than H \u2192 VV \u2192 4f or equivalent processes. Nonetheless, those contact terms are equivalent to the anomalous HVV couplings already tested using the f 1 and f Z\u03b3 1 parameters, defined below. It is assumed that all lepton and quark couplings to vector bosons follow the SM predictions. Relaxing this requirement would be equivalent to allowing the contact terms to vary with flavor, which would result in too many unconstrained parameters to be tested with the present amount of data. Only the lowest order operators, or lowest order terms in the (q 2 j / 2 ) form-factor expansion, are tested, where is an energy scale of new physics. Anomalous interactions of a spin-zero H boson with two spinone gauge bosons VV, such as ZZ, Z\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u03b3 , WW, and gg, are parameterized with a scattering amplitude that includes three tensor structures with expansion of coefficients up to (q 2 / 2 ):",

First of all, most systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio. Moreover, the effective fractions are conveniently bounded by 0 and 1 and do not depend on the normalization convention in the definition of the couplings. Until the effects of interference become important, the statistical uncertainties in these measurements scale with the integrated luminosity as 1/ The above approach allows a general test of the kinematic distributions associated with the couplings of H to 4 fermions, whether in the decay or in the associated production channels, as shown in Fig. 1. If deviations from the SM are detected, a more detailed study of the (q 2 j / 2 ) form-factor expansion can be performed, eventually providing a measurement of the doubledifferential cross section for each tested tensor structure. Under the assumption that the couplings are constant and real (i.e., \u03c6 ai = 0 or \u03c0 ), the above formulation is equivalent to an effective Lagrangian [13]. It is also equivalent to the formulation involving contact terms [35,36] if the contact terms are assumed to satisfy lepton universality. ",

            "text": "The H \u2192 4 decays are reconstructed in the CMS detector, which is composed of a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, all within a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Outside the solenoid are the gas-ionization detectors for muon measurements, which are embedded in the steel flux-return yoke. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [40]. A dedicated MC program, JHUGen 7.0.2 [26,29,33,41], is used to simulate the effect of anomalous couplings in the production and decay H \u2192 ZZ / Z\u03b3 * / \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 4 . The gluon fusion production of an H boson is simulated with the powheg 2.0 [42][43][44] event generator at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The associated gluon fusion production of an H boson with two jets is affected by anomalous Hgg interactions. These effects are modeled with JHUGen. It is also found that the NLO QCD effects that are relevant for the analysis of a spin-zero state are well described by a combination of leading-order (LO) matrix elements and parton showering [33]. For the SM case, JHUGen simulations at LO in QCD and powheg simulations at NLO in QCD, with parton showering applied in both cases, are explicitly compared, and no significant differences are found. Therefore, JHUGen at LO in QCD is adopted for the simulation of VBF, VH, and ttH production with anomalous couplings. The MELA package [2,26,29,33,41] contains a library of matrix elements from JHUGen for the H boson signal and mcfm 7.0 [45][46][47] for the SM background and is used to apply weights to events in any MC sample to model any other set of couplings.",

The main triggers for this analysis select a pair of leptons passing loose identification and isolation requirements, with p T of the leading and subleading electron (muon) at least 23 (17) and 12 (8) GeV, respectively. To maximize the signal acceptance, triggers requiring three leptons with lower p T thresholds and no isolation requirement are also used, as are isolated single-electron and single-muon triggers with higher p T thresholds. Electrons (muons) are reconstructed within the geometrical acceptance defined by |\u03b7| < 2.5 (2.4) for transverse momentum p T > 7 (5) GeV with an algorithm that combines information from the ECAL (muon system) and the tracker. It is required that the ratio of each lepton track's impact parameter in three dimensions, computed with respect to the chosen primary vertex position, to its uncertainty be less than 4. The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest sum of p 2 T of physics objects defined by a jet-finding algorithm. To discriminate prompt leptons from Z/\u03b3 * boson decays from those arising from hadron decays within jets, an isolation requirement for leptons is imposed. An algorithm is used to collect the final-state radiation (FSR) of leptons. An FSR photon is associated to the closest selected lepton in the event if its angular separation from the lepton is below the required threshold, as discussed in Ref. [48]. Three mutually exclusive channels are considered: H \u2192 4e, 4\u03bc, and 2e2\u03bc. At least two leptons are required to have p T > 10 GeV, and at least one is required to have p T > 20 GeV. All four pairs of oppositely charged leptons that can be built with the four leptons, irrespective of flavor, are required to satisfy m + \u2212 > 4 GeV. The Z/\u03b3 * candidates are required to satisfy the condition 12 GeV < m < 120 GeV; the invariant mass of at least one of the Z/\u03b3 * candidates must be larger than 40 GeV. The four-lepton invariant mass m 4 must be between 105 and 140 GeV.",

In the 2 \u2192 6 process of associated H boson production via either VBF, ZH, or WH and its subsequent decay to a four-fermion final state, up to 13 independent observables remain. In the following, we use either the production kinematics, the decay kinematics, or both, as appropriate. The p T of the system of the H boson and two jets, which would appear at NLO in QCD, is not included in the input observables in order to reduce associated QCD uncertainties.

Table 1 and described in more detail below. The selected events in the 2016 data sample are split into three categories: VBF-jet, VH-jet, and untagged. The VBF-jet category requires exactly four leptons with either two or three jets of which at most one is b quark flavor-tagged, or at least four jets and no b-tagged jets. The VH-jet category requires exactly four leptons and two or more jets; if there are four or more jets, none of them should be b tagged. The requirements on the number of b-tagged jets are applied to reduce cross-feed from ttH production. In order to separate the target production mode for each category from gluon fusion production, the requirement D 2jet > 0.5 is applied following Eq. (4), where P sig corresponds to the signal probability for the VBF (ZH or WH) production hypothesis in the VBF-jet (VH-jet) category, and P alt corresponds to the gluon fusion production of the H boson in association with two jets. In each of the four f ai analyses, the requirement D 2jet > 0.5 is tested with both the f ai = 0 and f ai = 1 signal hypotheses in P sig . Thus, this categorization differs slightly in the four analyses. The two highest p T jets are used in the calculation of the matrix elements. All events not assigned to the VBF-jet or VH-jet categories are assigned to the untagged category. The above requirements are summarized in Table 1. Due to the small size of the 2015 data sample, those events were not categorized and were all treated as untagged, as was done in the analysis of 2011 and 2012 data [13]. The expected and observed numbers of events are listed in Table 2. We perform an unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit to the events split into the categories according to the lepton flavor and production topology. An independent fit is performed for each parameter defined in Table 3. In each category of events, three observables D = {D bkg , D ai , D int } are defined following Eqs. (4) and (5), as summarized in Table 1.",
