            "text": "This paper presents the combinations of single-top-quark production crosssection measurements by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, using data from LHC proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.17 to 5.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 12.2 to 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. These combinations are performed per centre-of-mass energy and for each production mode: tchannel, tW , and s-channel. The combined t-channel cross-sections are 67.5 \u00b1 5.7 pb and 87.7 \u00b1 5.8 pb at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV respectively. The combined tW cross-sections are 16.3 \u00b1 4.1 pb and 23.1 \u00b1 3.6 pb at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV respectively. For the schannel cross-section, the combination yields 4.9 \u00b1 1.4 pb at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The square of the magnitude of the CKM matrix element V tb multiplied by a form factor f LV is determined for each production mode and centre-of-mass energy, using the ratio of the measured cross-section to its theoretical prediction. It is assumed that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |V td |, |V ts | |V tb |. All the |f LV V tb | 2 determinations, extracted from individual ratios at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, are combined, resulting in |f LV V tb | = 1.02 \u00b1 0.04 (meas.) \u00b1 0.02 (theo.). All combined measurements are consistent with their corresponding Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "Measurements of single-top-quark production via the electroweak interaction, a process first observed in proton-antiproton (pp) collisions at the Tevatron [1,2], have entered the precision era at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has become possible to measure topquark properties using single-top-quark events [3]. Single-top-quark production is sensitive to new physics mechanisms [4] that either modify the tW b coupling [5][6][7][8][9][10] or introduce new JHEP05 (2019)088particles and interactions [11][12][13][14][15][16]. The production rate of single top quarks is proportional to the square of the left-handed coupling at the tW b production vertex, assuming that there are no significant tW d or tW s contributions. In the Standard Model (SM), this coupling is given by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)  [17,18] matrix element V tb . Indirect measurements of |V tb |, from precision measurements of B-meson decays [19] and from topquark decays [20][21][22][23], rely on the SM assumptions that the CKM matrix is unitary and that there are three quark generations. The most stringent indirect determination comes from a global fit to all available B-physics measurements, resulting in |V tb | = 0.999105 \u00b1 0.000032 [19]. This fit also assumes the absence of any new physics mechanisms that might affect b-quarks. The most precise indirect measurement using top-quark events was performed by the CMS Collaboration in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV, resulting in |V tb | = 1.007 \u00b1 0.016 [23]. A direct estimate of the coupling at the tW b production vertex, |f LV V tb |, is obtained from the measured single-top-quark cross-section \u03c3 meas. and its corresponding theoretical expectation \u03c3 theo. , 1) .",

            "text": "The f LV term is a form factor, assumed to be real, that parameterises the possible presence of anomalous left-handed vector couplings [24]. By construction, this form factor is exactly one in the SM, while it can be different from one in models of new physics processes. The direct estimation assumes that |V td |, |V ts | |V tb | [25,26], and that the tW b interaction involves a left-handed weak coupling, like that in the SM. The |f LV V tb | determination via single-top-quark production is independent of assumptions about the number of quark generations and the unitarity of the CKM matrix [4,[27][28][29]. Since the indirect determination of |V tb | gives a value close to unity, V tb is considered equal to one in theoretical calculations of the single-top-quark cross-section. The combination of single-top-quark measurements from the Tevatron gives |f LV V tb | = 1.02 +0.06 \u22120.05 [30]. Single-top-quark production at a hadron collider mostly proceeds, according to the SM prediction, via three modes that can be defined at leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD): the exchange of a virtual W boson in the t-channel or in the s-channel, and the associated production of a top quark and a W boson (tW ). Representative Feynman diagrams for these processes at LO are shown in figure 1.",

For t-channel production at LO, the b-quark can be considered as directly emitted from the other proton (five-flavour-number scheme or 5FS) or it can come from gluon splitting (four-flavournumber scheme or 4FS) [31]. The kinematic properties of the spectator quark provide distinctive features for this process [32,33]. The associated production of a W boson and a top quark has the second-largest production cross-section. In a representative process of tW production, a gluon interacts with an initial b-quark by exchanging a virtual b-quark,  Figure 1.

The s-channel cross-section is the smallest at the LHC. In this process, a quark-antiquark pair annihilates to produce a time-like virtual W boson, which decays to a t-quark and ab-quark. This process was observed in pp collisions at the Tevatron [36] and evidence of it was reported by the ATLAS Collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV [37]. In this paper, the t-channel, tW , and s-channel single-top-quark cross-section measurements by the ATLAS and CMS experiments are combined for each production mode, separately at pp centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. A combined determination of |f LV V tb | is also presented, using as inputs the values of |f LV V tb | 2 calculated from the measured and predicted single-top-quark cross-sections in the three production modes at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. Using the same approach, results are also shown for |f LV V tb | combinations for each production mode.",

The advantage of the NLO cross-section calculations is that the configurable parameters in HatHor can be set according to those used to generate the ATLAS and CMS simulation samples. The t-and s-channel processes do not interfere at NLO [52]. For these two processes, the entire phase space is included in the integration in order to obtain the total cross-section. The tW cross-section prediction, \u03c3 tW theo. , is available at NLO [41] and NLO+NNLL [47,53]. The tW process at NLO interferes with the tt process at LO with the subsequent decayt \u2192 Wb. In the NLO prediction for tW production provided in ref. [41], a kinematic cut-off is imposed on the transverse momentum (p T ) of the outgoing b-quark, suppressing the contribution from tt production. Since the treatment of this interference in HatHor is still being developed [54,55], the NLO+NNLL calculation is used as reference for tW production. For the reference cross-section predictions, uncertainties corresponding to the dependence on m t and on the LHC beam energy, E beam , are evaluated. The m t dependence is estimated by varying its central value of 172.5 GeV (the value used in the simulation samples used to measure the single-top-quark cross-sections) by \u00b11 GeV, using the functional form proposed in ref. [56]. The theoretical calculations are performed at a given centre-of-mass energy while the energy of the LHC beam is measured with an uncertainty. The single-top-quark cross-sections are assumed to depend on E beam according to the model given in ref. [57], with a relative uncertainty \u03b4E beam /E beam of 0.1% [58]. The theoretical cross-sections that are used as reference are marked with a \u2020 in table 1. Table 1. Predicted cross-sections for single-top-quark production at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV at the LHC. Uncertainties include scale and PDF+\u03b1 s variations, except for the NNLO predictions, which only contain the scale variation. The PDF+\u03b1 s uncertainties are evaluated according to the PDF4LHC prescription only for the NLO predictions. The uncertainties associated with the top-quark mass m t and beam energy E beam are also given for the NLO predictions for the t-and s-channels, and for the NLO+NNLL prediction for tW production. The value of m t is set to 172.5 GeV in all predictions. The cross-sections marked with \u2020 are those used in the |f LV V tb | combination.",

Evidence of tW production was reported at \u221a s = 7 TeV by ATLAS [61] and CMS [62], while at \u221a s = 8 TeV its cross-section, \u03c3 tW , was measured by both experiments [34,35]. Evidence of s-channel production was reported by ATLAS, with a measured cross-section, \u03c3 s-chan. , at \u221a s = 8 TeV [37], whereas CMS set upper limits on the s-channel production cross-section at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. The observed (expected) significance of the CMS measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV is 2.3 (0.8) standard deviations [63]. The ATLAS and CMS analyses use similar approaches to measure the single-top-quark production cross-sections. Both experiments select events containing at least one prompt isolated lepton (electron or muon) and at least one high-p T jet. The analyses use various multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques, such as boosted decision trees [64][65][66], neural networks [67], or the matrix element method (MEM) [68,69], to separate the signal from background. To measure the cross-section, analyses perform a binned maximum-likelihood fit to data using the distribution of the corresponding MVA discriminator. Exceptions are the ATLAS s-channel and CMS t-channel measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV. In the ATLAS s-channel analysis, the fit is performed simultaneously to the MEM discriminant -5 -  Table 2. Summary of the single-top-quark cross-section measurements published by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. Total uncertainties are shown. Small differences between the integrated luminosity values in different analyses within the same experiment and centre-of-mass energy are due to different luminosity calibrations at the time of publication. in the signal region and the lepton-charge distribution in the W +jets control region. The CMS t-channel measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV is based on a simultaneous fit to the absolute pseudorapidity (\u03b7) distributions of the recoiling light-flavour jet in events with negative and with positive lepton charge. The analyses measuring different single-top-quark production modes within the same experiment and at the same centre-of-mass energy have disjoint signal regions. Both experiments simulate the single-top-quark processes using the NLO Powheg-Box generator [70][71][72][73][74] for the matrix-element (ME) calculations. ATLAS also uses the Powheg-Box generator to simulate top-quark-pair background events, while CMS uses the LO MadGraph generator [75]. The Pythia [76] event generator is used for modelling the parton shower (PS), hadronisation and the underlying event in both the single-top-quark and tt processes. The cross-sections are measured assuming a value of 172.5 GeV for m t for all top-quark processes and all centre-of-mass energies. A summary of the uncertainties in each measurement is shown in table 2, with details given in appendix A.",

The BLUE method is applied iteratively in order to reduce a possible bias arising from the dependence of systematic uncertainties on the central value of the cross-section [80]. Convergence is reached when the central value changes by less than 0.01% compared with the previous iteration. In each iteration, the BLUE method minimises the global \u03c7 2 by adjusting the weight for each input measurement [79]. The global \u03c7 2 is calculated taking correlations into account. The sum of weights is required to be equal to one. Negative weights are allowed; these indicate strong correlations [81]. The number of degrees of freedom is n\u22121, where n is number of measurements in the combination. The \u03c7 2 and n are then used to calculate a corresponding probability [79].",

In the ATLAS t-channel measurements, they are also estimated in W +jets simulated event samples, by varying the scale and matching parameters in the Alpgen LO multileg generator [89] at \u221a s = 7 TeV and by varying the parameters controlling the scale in the Sherpa LO multileg generator [90] at \u221a s = 8 TeV. In the CMS measurements, these uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales, and ISR/FSR, consistently in the simulated event samples. In the CMS t-channel measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV, this uncertainty applies only to the signal modelling since the modelling of the dominant tt and W +jets background processes is obtained from data. However, for the t-channel analysis at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the scales are varied in the simulated signal, tt, W +jets and other single-top-quark processes. The same approach is followed in the CMS s-channel measurements at both centre-of-mass energies.

The ATLAS analyses additionally include an uncertainty in the PS and hadronisation modelling in simulated single-top-quark and tt events, evaluated by comparing the Powheg-Box event generator interfaced to Pythia or to Herwig. The CMS analyses additionally include an uncertainty in the tt and W +jets backgrounds estimated with the MadGraph event generator interfaced to Pythia. It is evaluated in simulated event samples where the value of the ME/PS matching threshold in the MLM method [107] is doubled or halved from its initial value. The CMS t-channel measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV does not consider this uncertainty in the tt and W +jets backgrounds since the distribution and normalisation of the tt and W +jets processes are derived mostly from data. In the CMS tW analyses at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, the contributions of the W +jets and other single-top-quark processes in the dilepton final state are negligible.",

The exceptions are the t-channel measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV, where the background from simulation includes top-quark background, as shown in tables 9-13 in appendix A. The normalisation of the main background processes is determined from data, either by inclusion of normalisation uncertainties as nuisance parameters in the fit used to extract the signal, or through dedicated techniques based on data. In the t-channel and s-channel measurements, the uncertainties in the theoretical cross-section predictions for the top-quark, W/Z+jets, and diboson processes are included. In the tW measurements, the uncertainties in the theoretical cross-section predictions for the topquark and diboson processes are taken into account. In the ATLAS measurements of the t-channel process at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, the uncertainty in the multijet background is estimated by comparing background estimates made using different techniques based on simulation and data samples. In the ATLAS tW analyses at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, the normalisation uncertainty in the background from misidentified and non-prompt leptons is obtained from variations in the data-based estimate. In the ATLAS s-channel analysis, the uncertainty assigned to the normalisation of the multijet background is based on control samples. For all CMS measurements, background normalisations are constrained in the fits to data. In the CMS measurements of the t-channel and s-channel processes, the uncertainties in the multijet background are assessed by comparing the results of alternative background estimation methods based on data.

In the ATLAS analyses at \u221a s = 8 TeV, this uncertainty is evaluated as a component of the JES, separated into four terms (number of primary vertices, average number of collisions per bunchcrossing, average pile-up energy density in the calorimeter, and p T dependence) since the pile-up calibration (assuming average conditions during 8 TeV data-taking) is JHEP05(2019)088 applied to both data and simulation before selecting and calibrating the jets [117]. In CMS, the reweighting uses a model with a free parameter that can be interpreted as an effective cross-section for inelastic pp interactions. This uncertainty is obtained from a fit to the number of additional primary vertices in simulation. In the CMS analyses, this uncertainty is introduced as a nuisance parameter in the fit. The only exception is the s-channel measurement, where the pile-up uncertainty is estimated from pseudoexperiments.

The values of the combined tW crosssections at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV are 16.3 \u00b1 4.1 pb and 23.1 \u00b1 3.6 pb respectively.

Similar to the approach that is followed in combinations using the BLUE method, the total uncertainty in these tables is evaluated as the sum in quadrature of the individual uncertainties. To obtain the impact of each source of uncertainty, the input analyses use either pseudoexperiments or approximate procedures which neglect the correlations between sources of uncertainty introduced by the fit to data.

The contribution is included in the total statistical uncertainty. This uncertainty is therefore considered to be zero for the CMS measurement to avoid double-counting. Since the statistical uncertainties in the data and simulation are uncorrelated between the two experiments, this choice has almost no effect on the combination. The result from ATLAS has smaller uncertainties. This is attributed to the use of the latest simulation samples with tuned parameters [126] as well as the use of the matrix element method in the ATLAS analysis. In addition, all systematic uncertainties are profiled in the ATLAS analysis, while in the CMS analysis, major JHEP05 (2019)088uncertainties, including those from jets and in the theory modelling category, are excluded from the fit and evaluated using pseudoexperiments. The total uncertainties in table 13 are slightly different from the uncertainties shown in table 2 because here the uncertainties are summed in quadrature, while in the input analyses the impacts of at least some of the uncertainties are included in the fits to data. In particular, the difference between the relative total uncertainty shown in table 2 for the ATLAS measurement, i.e. 34.4%, and the relative total uncertainty shown in table 13 is due to the usage of an approximate procedure to compute the individual uncertainty contributions. Possible correlation terms between the systematic uncertainties introduced by the fit are not included here.",
