Gulbrandsen 49   Abstract The production of mesons containing strange quarks (K 0 S , \u03c6) and both singly and doubly strange baryons ( , , and \u2212 + + ) are measured at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results are obtained from the analysis of about 250 k minimum bias events recorded in 2009. Measurements of yields (dN/dy) and transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity for inelastic pp collisions are presented. For mesons, we report yields ( dN/dy ) of 0.184 \u00b1 0.002(stat.) \u00b1 0.006(syst.) for K 0 S and 0.021 \u00b1 0.004(stat.) \u00b1 0.003(syst.) for \u03c6. For baryons, we find dN/dy = 0.048 \u00b1 0.001(stat.) \u00b1 0.004(syst.) for , 0.047 \u00b1 0.002(stat.) \u00b1 0.005(syst.) for and 0.0101 \u00b1 0.0020(stat.) \u00b1 0.0009(syst.) for \u2212 + + . The results are also compared with predictions for identified particle spectra from QCD-inspired models and provide a baseline for comparisons with both future pp measurements at higher energies and heavy-ion collisions.",

            "text": "The production of hadrons at high transverse momenta in high energy proton-proton collisions is reasonably well described by perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) in terms of hard parton-parton scattering (large momentum transfers) followed by fragmentation [1,2]. However, the low-momentum region, where most particles are produced and which therefore contributes most to the underlying event, is dominated by soft interactions. In the soft regime, it has been found that particle production can be described effectively by models based on emission from an equilibrated system at a specific temperature and baryochemical potential, with additional accounting of conserved quantities [3][4][5]. It can also be treated in the framework of QCD inspired phenomenological models, that include multiparton processes, extrapolated to very low-momentum transfers [6]. The contribution and evolution of multi-parton processes as a function of \u221a s is difficult to establish. Measurements of identified particles at the beam injection energy of the LHC and in the low transverse momentum (p T ) region, along with their comparison with QCD-inspired models, constitute a baseline for comparisons with higher centre-ofmass energies. The low p T cutoff achievable through the low material budget, low central barrel magnetic field (0.5 T) and excellent particle identification (PID) of the ALICE detectors, allows an accurate measurement of the low momentum region at mid-rapidity.",

The basic unit of the TOF system is a 10-gap double-stack MRPC strip 122 cm long and 13 cm wide, with an active area of 120 \u00d7 7.4 cm 2 subdivided into two rows of 48 pads of 3.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm 2 . Five modules of three different types are needed to cover the full cylinder along the z direction. All modules have the same structure and width (128 cm) but differ in length. The overall TOF barrel length is 741 cm (active region). It has 152 928 readout channels and an average thickness of 25-30% of a radiation length, depending on the detector zone. For pp collisions, such a segmentation leads to an occupancy smaller than 0.02%. Its front-end electronics is designed to comply with the basic characteristics of a MRPC detector, i.e. very fast differential signals from the anode and cathode readout. Test beam results demonstrated a time resolution below 50 ps, dominated by the jitter in the electronic readout.",

Its distance from each daughter track is taken to be proportional to the precision of the track parameter estimations. Once their position is determined, only the V0 candidates located inside a given fiducial volume are kept. The inner boundary of this fiducial volume is at a radius of 0.2 cm from the primary vertex, while the outer limit is set at 100 cm. Finally, for and reconstruction, the V0 finding procedure checks whether the particle momentum (p) associated with the V0 candidate (calculated as the sum of the track momenta extrapolated to the position of the DCA) points back to the primary vertex. This is achieved by applying a cut on the cosine of the angle (pointing angle \u03b8 p ) between p and a vector connecting the primary vertex and the V0 position (cos \u03b8 p > 0.99). The invariant mass of each candidate can then be calculated either under the K 0 S or the hypothesis. The TPC PID helps substantially to remove the combinatorial background for the and (mainly for the baryon daughter identification, while it is not needed for the K 0 S decaying into pions). TPC PID is described in Sect. 3.2.3.  The selections here concern the proton daughter only and have been chosen to be looser for the daughter track with momentum below 0.7 GeV/c (\u00b15\u03c3 ) and tighter for higher momentum (\u00b13\u03c3 ). The \u2212 + + particles are identified via their \"cascade\" decay topology. The cascade finding procedure starts from the V0 finding procedure for the daughter but with less stringent selection criteria (see Table 2 and Cascade vertex selections). This is done to increase the efficiency and to allow for the fact that the daughter 's do not have to point back to the primary vertex.",

It is found that the background can be well reproduced by a function f (M) = a \u221a M \u2212 b, while the peak has the shape of a Gaussian. The peak range is defined as \u00b14\u03c3 around the PDG mass of the \u03c6, where \u03c3 = /2.35 and is the nominal value of the resonance full width at half maximum (4.5 MeV/c 2 ) [18].

While fluctuations of the fit values as a function of the fit range are taken into account for the systematic error (see Sect. 3.5.1), the fit values used for all subsequent steps in the analysis are those that minimize the difference |\u03c7 2 /NDF \u2212 1|.

Little dependence is found on the several MC generators which are used. Therefore the corrections presented here are obtained using the event generator PYTHIA 6.4 (tune D6T) [1,20] and GEANT3 [21,22] for particle transport through the ALICE detectors. The MC information is propagated through the whole reconstruction and identification procedure to generate the differential p T efficiencies as shown in Fig. 10 for K 0 S , and and in Fig. 11 for \u03c6 and \u2212 + + . The uncertainties correspond to the statistics of Monte Carlo samples used to compute the corrections. For all particles, the global efficiency is limited at low p T because of the acceptance of at least two charged daughter tracks in the detection volume of the TPC (three tracks in the case of \u2212 + + ). It rapidly increases with p T but cannot exceed the asymptotic limits given by the charged particle decay branching ratios presented in Table 3. The difference between the and reflects the absorption of the anti-proton daughter of the . For all the variables used to select the particles and improve the signal over noise ratio (see Tables 1 and 2), it is verified that data and MC distributions match, thus possible efficiency biases can be properly managed. Examples of such distributions are presented in Fig. 12.",

For the \u03c6 signal, the systematic uncertainties from background subtraction are estimated using three different criteria. First of all, the function reproducing the background is replaced by a second or third order polynomial. Moreover, the fit is repeated fixing the width parameter to \u00b110% of the value obtained in the default procedure (described in Sect. 3.3), and also to the value obtained when fitting the Monte Carlo sample and to \u00b110% of this.

The material budget uncertainty, based on \u03b3 conversion measurements, is estimated to be 7% in terms or radiation length [23]. The efficiency variation due to this material budget uncertainty depends on the momentum of each of the decay daughters. Although such a variation is also correlated with the momentum of the parent particle, the corresponding systematic uncertainties are reported as point-to-point errors in Table 4 for the lowest, the average and the highest p T bin and eventually added in quadrature to the total systematic errors. Specific uncertainties are related to the (anti-)proton absorption and scattering cross-sections used for propagating these particles through the geometry of the detectors with both GEANT3 [21,22] (and its default absorption crosssections) and GEANT4 (using the absorption cross-sections of [27]). More details about the modifications can be found in [23][24][25][26] and references therein. The corresponding corrections are taken into account in the efficiency versus p T assuming that absorption cross-sections are identical for the (anti-) hyperon and its (anti-) proton daughter.

For example, it changes from 168 \u00b1 5 MeV for K 0 S to 229 \u00b1 15 MeV for when the L\u00e9vy fit is used. The \u2212 + + apparently do not follow this trend. However, this is most likely because the very limited statistics do not allow for a well-constrained fit. The shapes of the p T spectra are also compared to PHOJET and PYTHIA models. For PYTHIA, several tunes (109 [20], 306 [30] and 320 [31]) are presented. For all species, the p T spectra are found to be slightly harder (i.e. they have a slower decrease with p T ) than the models as presented in Figs. 15, 16, 17 and 18. For transverse momenta larger than \u223c1 GeV/c, the strange particle spectra are strongly underestimated by all models, by a factor of \u223c2 for K 0 S and even \u223c3 for hyperons.

STAR results are taken from [28], CDF ones and yield values with \" * \" are from [35]. Other UA5 values concerning p T are from [34] Experiment  [36,37] acceptance (|y| < 2.0) using PYTHIA simulations. The + yield in NSD events is estimated by scaling the measured yield in inelastic events with the known ratio R of charged particle multiplicities in NSD and INEL events [16]: This scaling factor is also used for the ALICE ( \u2212 + + ) yield presented in Table 9. The ALICE yields and p T for both ( + ) and ( \u2212 + + ) are in good agreement with the UA5 measurements [37]. Table 10 shows the evolution of dN/dy and p T with the collision energy for the \u03c6 particle scaled to NSD events using also Eq. 3. It includes the ALICE measurements, which are the first \u03c6 measurements at 900 GeV, and compares them to the results from the STAR experiment [38,39] at 200 GeV and the E735 experiment [40] at 1800 GeV. The baryon to meson ratio as a function of p T obtained with the ( + ) and K 0 S spectra measured by ALICE is presented in Fig. 21. It includes the ( + )/2K 0 S ratio in pp collisions at 200 GeV measured by STAR [28], and the ratios in pp collisions at 630 GeV and 1800 GeV computed with the ( + ) and K 0 S spectra published by CDF [41] and UA1 [42]. UA1 and CDF Collaborations provide inclusive spectra whereas the ALICE and STAR ones are feed-  [28,32] and the ISR parameterization [33]. Both statistical (vertical error bars) and systematic (brackets) uncertainties are shown for ALICE data down corrected. 1 The acceptance windows of these experiments differ significantly: ALICE measures , and K 0 S in |y| < 0.75, STAR in |y| < 0.5, CDF in |\u03b7| < 1.0, whereas UA1 reconstructs ( + ) in |\u03b7| < 2.0 and K 0 S in |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ALICE ratio agrees very well with the STAR results in the measured p T range, which would suggest little or no energy dependence of ( + )/2K 0 S . A similar conclusion can be drawn when comparing only the ratios measured by CDF at 630 GeV and 1800 GeV. However, the absolute ratio found by CDF for p T > 1.5 GeV/c is significantly higher than the one observed with ALICE and STAR. Also the ratio computed from UA1 spectra shows a clear disagreement with the ALICE and STAR data above p T \u2248 1.5 GeV/c and in addition differs from CDF in the intermediate p T range (1.5-3 GeV/c). PYTHIA simulations show that this discrep- Table 10 The \u03c6 mean transverse momentum and yields for different \u221a s. STAR results (NSD) are from [38,39] and E735 non-diffractive results (ND) are from [40].

The STAR ratio is taken from [28] whereas the CDF and UA1 ratios are computed with the ( + ) and K 0 S spectra published in [41] and [42] respectively. The ALICE and STAR ratios are feed-down corrected. Because the K 0 S and ( + ) spectra from UA1 have incompatible binning, the K 0 S differential yield has been calculated for each ( + ) p T data point using the fit function published by UA1. Such a choice is motivated by the fact that the \u03c7 2 value for the K 0 S spectrum fit is better than that for the ( + ) spectrum ancy can not be attributed to the differences in the acceptance or in the colliding system (i.e. pp instead of pp).",

            "text": "Measurements of mesons containing strange quarks (K 0 S and \u03c6) and hyperons ( , and \u2212 + + ) have been performed for inelastic pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The L\u00e9vy function gives a good description of the transverse momentum spectra which have been compared with pQCD-based models. The K 0 S transverse momentum spectrum is overestimated by PYTHIA tune ATLAS-CSC and PHOJET below 0.75 GeV/c but is higher by a factor of \u223c2 in the p T range [1][2][3] GeV/c. Within uncertainties, the \u03c6 meson spectrum is reasonably described by these models and the best agreement is obtained by PYTHIA tune D6T. We find that strange baryons are significantly under-predicted in both PYTHIA and PHOJET by a factor of \u223c3. The feed-down corrected ratio of baryon to meson as a function of p T , illustrated by the /K 0 S , is consistent with the STAR measurements at \u221a s = 0.2 TeV but lower than UA1 and CDF results at \u221a s = 0.63 TeV and \u221a s = 1.8 TeV. The integrated yields and average transverse momenta have been compared with earlier data collected in pp and pp interactions at various energies. These results provide a useful baseline for comparisons with recent tunes of the PYTHIA model and a reference for future measurements in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. These studies demonstrate the precision with which ALICE can measure resonances and topologically reconstructed weakly decaying particles. Measurements of these particles will be a substantial part of the ALICE programme in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The measurement of the \u03c6 resonance provides an unprecedented reference at this energy.
