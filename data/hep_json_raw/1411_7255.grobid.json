The study is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector in 2012. The integrated luminosity of the sample is 19.7 fb \u22121 . Many models of new physics predict the production of events with jets, electroweak gauge bosons, and little or no missing transverse momentum. Examples include stealth models of supersymmetry (SUSY), which predict a hidden sector at the electroweak energy scale in which SUSY is approximately conserved. The data are used to search for stealth SUSY signatures in final states with either two photons or an oppositely charged electron and muon. No excess is observed with respect to the standard model expectation, and the results are used to set limits on squark pair production in the stealth SUSY framework.",

            "text": "Models of supersymmetry [1,2] (SUSY) with a stable, neutral, massive, weakly interacting, lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) have received considerable attention in recent years because they simultaneously offer a solution to the hierarchy problem, allow unification of the fundamental interactions, and provide a dark matter candidate. Many searches for SUSY are based on this scenario, which predicts large missing transverse momentum p miss T as a consequence of the undetected LSPs. Nonetheless, well-motivated models of SUSY exist that predict small p miss T , such as models with R-parity violation [3], gauge mediated SUSY breaking [4], compressed spectra [5,6], or hidden valleys [7]. Many non-SUSY models of new physics, including theories with extra dimensions [8], heavy-flavor compositeness [9], or little Higgs scenarios [10,11], similarly predict low-p miss T final states. As the parameter space available for high-p miss T signatures becomes constrained by results from the CERN LHC [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], searches for these low-p miss T alternatives become increasingly pertinent.",

The simplest stealth SUSY models assume low-scale SUSY breaking and introduce a new hidden sector of particles at the weak scale, analogous to the SUSY-breaking sector, which experiences only minimal SUSY breaking through the interactions with SM fields. Because it is weakly connected to the SUSY-breaking sector, the hidden sector is populated with nearly mass-degenerate superpartners. With this addition, the LSP of non-stealth scenarios, taken to be a gaugino (i.e., a neutralino or chargino), assumes the role of the lightest \"visible sector\" SUSY particle (LVSP) and can decay without violating R-parity [24] to yield a lighter hidden-sector SUSY particle. The LSP in this model is produced from the decay of the hidden-sector SUSY particle to its SM partner, and the near mass degeneracy of the superpartners results in the LSP being produced with low momentum. Thus, stealth SUSY models naturally produce low-p miss T signatures with neither R-parity violation nor a special tuning of masses.",

We ensure isolation from other activity in the event by restricting the scalar p T sum of all PFreconstructed photons and charged and neutral hadrons within a cone R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the muon direction to be less than 12% of the candidate p T after subtracting the contributions of additional pp collisions (pileup) [28].",

The ECAL endcap regions are omitted due to the low expected signal acceptance in these regions. The shape of the matched ECAL cluster must be consistent with that expected for electrons, and the difference in the inverse cluster energy and the inverse track momentum must be less than 0.05 GeV \u22121 . The electron candidate is required to be inconsistent with the conversion of a photon to an e + e \u2212 pair in the tracker. The track for the candidate must have a longitudinal impact parameter less than 1 mm with respect to the primary vertex and fewer than two missing hits in the tracker. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k T clustering algorithm [30] with a distance parameter of 0.5 using PF objects as input [31]. To remove jets arising from potential instrumental and non-collision backgrounds, we require the fraction of jet energy coming from charged and neutral electromagnetic deposits to be less than 0.99, the neutral hadron fraction to be less than 0.99, and the charged hadron fraction to be greater than zero. The jet energy and momentum are corrected for the nonlinear response of the calorimeter and the effects of pileup [32]. Jets are required to have corrected p T > 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, and to be isolated from photon and lepton candidates by R > 0.5. Jets are identified as originating from b-quark hadronization (b-tagged) using a combined secondary vertex algorithm that yields 70% signal efficiency for b jets and 1.5% misidentification of light quark jets [33].",

Up to four additional partons are allowed. For the \u00b1 analysis, we generate samples of events with a top quarkantiquark (tt) pair, Drell-Yan (DY), ZZ, WW, and WZ production. The tt sample is produced with up to three additional partons, the DY sample is produced with up to four additional partons, and the diboson samples are produced with up to two additional partons. Single-top quark (t-, s-, and tW-channels) samples are generated with the powheg v1.0 [38][39][40][41][42] generator. The tt and DY samples are normalized to cross sections calculated at next-tonext-to-leading-order accuracy [43,44]. The normalizations of the single-top quark and diboson samples are valid to next-to-leadingorder (NLO) [45] and LO [46], respectively. The diphoton sample is used only to validate the background estimation method and so its normalization is not relevant. We generate signal samples for both analyses using the pythia generator with the CMS fast simulation [47] of the detector. The models are characterized by the masses of the particles in the decay chain. The small S-S mass splitting, the central feature of stealth SUSY, is taken to be 10 GeV, and we assume the S mass to be 100 GeV.

The largest uncertainty in the assumed shape of the S T distribution is due to the statistical uncertainty in the estimation of the fitted parameter p 1 (Section 4), which results in a systematic uncertainty of 31% for S T > 1200 GeV. The second largest uncertainty associated with the shape arises from the assumption that the S T shape is independent of N jets . We estimate this uncertainty by first separately fitting the S T distributions for N jets = 4 and N jets \u2265 5 to the nominal function, for the diphoton simulation in the selection A region and for the data in the selection B region. We then compare the resulting fitted parameter values with the nominal results for N jets = 3 in the corresponding sample and take the largest difference as the systematic uncertainty in the values of the parameters. The largest difference is observed for N jets \u2265 5 and corresponds to a systematic uncertainty of 15% in the background prediction. The smallest shape uncertainty, which is related to the choice of the fit function, is evaluated by constructing the envelope formed by the nominal fit function and the two alternate fit functions described in Section 4 and results in a 12% variation in the total background prediction for S T > 1200 GeV.",

For the \u00b1 analysis, the uncertainty due to the jet energy scale is 5%. We assign an uncertainty of 1% to account for the muon trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, 3% to account for the electron reconstruction efficiency, and 0-7% (depending on the S T threshold and N jets ) to account for the finite size of the simulated event samples. For both analyses the uncertainty related to the size of the data sample is 2.6% [59], while the uncertainties related to the PDFs and pileup interactions are found to be negligible.",

The data are seen to agree with the background estimate within the uncertainties. Fig. 5 shows the corresponding results for the \u00b1 analysis. The event yields for S T > 1200 GeV are listed in Table 4 with the total (stat. + syst.) uncertainties. The data are seen to agree with the background expectations. We determine 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the squark pair production cross section in the stealth SUSY framework described above. We use the modified frequentist CL S method [60,61] based on a log-likelihood ratio test statistic that compares the likelihood of the SM-only hypothesis to the likelihood of the presence of signal in addition to the SM contributions. For the \u03b3 analysis, the likelihood functions for N jets = 4 and N jets \u2265 5 are based on the expected shapes of the S T distributions for signal and background, and the total likelihood function is the product of the two. For the \u00b1 analysis we perform a simultaneous comparison of the number of signal and background events passing the optimized S min T threshold defined in Section 5 in the N jets = 4, 5, 6, and \u22657 samples, with the likelihood function given by the product of Poisson likelihood terms from each of the N jets regions.",

For the \u00b1 analysis, all uncertainties except those arising from statistical uncertainties in the control samples are taken to be correlated across the N jets bins. Fig. 6 shows the cross section upper limits for the \u03b3 analysis as a function of the squark and neutralino masses. The predicted NLO + NLL cross section is used to place constraints on the masses of the squarks and neutralinos under the assumption of stealth SUSY. We show the observed (median expected) mass exclusion with a band corresponding to the variation of the theoretical (experimental) uncertainties by one standard deviation. For higher neutralino masses, we exclude squark masses below 1050 GeV at a 95% CL for the \u03b3 analysis. At low masses the neutralino becomes more boosted, and the resulting decay products are more tightly collimated, spoiling the isolation of the photon. As a result the limit degrades for neutralino masses below 300 GeV.

Selection B is applied to events passing the H T trigger and requires H T > 800 GeV, exactly one photon with p T > 15 GeV, and at least two jets. Additionally, we require p T < 75 GeV for the photon to make this sample disjoint from a single photon selection, not discussed here, that was used to test the background estimation method. Events that satisfy selection B, along with simulated diphoton events, are used to validate the background estimation method. Events that satisfy selection A are further divided into three samples, shown in",
