A baseline detector concept, APODIS (A PFA Oriented Detector for the HIggS factory), has been proposed for the CEPC CDR (Conceptual Design Report) study. We explore the Higgs signatures at this baseline setup with \u03bd\u03bdHiggs events. The detector performance of the charged particles, the photons, and the jets are quantified with Higgs \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5, \u03b3\u03b3, and jet final states respectively. The accuracy of reconstructed Higgs boson mass is comparable at different decay modes with jets in the final states. We also analyze the Higgs \u2192 WW * and ZZ * decay modes, where a clear separation between different decay cascades is observed.",

The CEPC, a future high energy collider project based on a 100 km circumference main ring [3], is therefore proposed. Operating at 240 GeV center of mass energy, the CEPC has an instant luminosity of \u223c3\u00d710 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and can deliver 10 6 Higgs bosons [4]. The CEPC can determine the absolute Higgs boson couplings to the relative accuracy of 0.1% -1%, roughly one order of magnitude superior to the Higgs signal strength measurements at the HL-LHC [5,6].",

            "text": "At the CEPC, the Standard Model (SM) Higgs bosons are produced mainly through the Higgsstrahlung process ( e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH) and the vector boson fusion processes (the Z fusion process e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 H, and the W fusion process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdH), see Figure 1. The corresponding cross sections with a 125 GeV SM Higgs boson using non-polarized beam at different center of mass energy is shown in Figure 2. At the CEPC, roughly a quarter of the Higgs boson is generated in association with a pair of neutrinos (\u03bd\u03bdH), including both the W fusion events and the ZH events with Z decays to \u03bd\u03bd. The Higgs boson is responsible for almost all the detector signals in these \u03bd\u03bdH events, providing benchmark samples for the CEPC detector performance study. This manuscript presents the performance analysis of the CEPC baseline detector geometry APODIS (a.k.a. the CEPC v4) [7]. Using full simulated \u03bd\u03bdH samples, we analyze a set of Higgs signal distributions that covers all the major SM Higgs decay modes. In section 2, we introduce the baseline detector and the software tools. Section 3 shows the reconstruction results of the Higgs signals. A conclusion is given in section 4.",
