The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector. Events are selected by requiring two jets with large rapidity separation and invariant mass, one or two leptons (electrons or muons), and a W or Z boson decaying hadronically. No excess of events with respect to the standard model background predictions is observed and constraints on the structure of quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of dimension-8 effective field theory operators are reported. Stringent limits on parameters of the effective field theory operators are obtained. The observed 95% confidence level limits for the S0, M0, and T0 operators are \u22122.7 < f S0 / 4 < 2.7, \u22121.0 < f M0 / 4 < 1.0, and \u22120.17 < f T0 / 4 < 0.16, in units of TeV \u22124 . Constraints are also reported on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for vector boson fusion production of charged Higgs bosons as a function of mass from 600 to 2000 GeV. The results are interpreted in the context of the Georgi-Machacek model.",

The non-Abelian structure of the EW sector leads to self-interactions between gauge bosons via triple and quartic gauge couplings. At the CERN LHC interactions from VBS are characterized by the presence of two gauge bosons in association with two forward jets with large rapidity separation and large dijet invariant mass. The discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] established that W and Z gauge bosons acquire mass via the Higgs mechanism. Models of physics beyond the SM predict enhancements in VBS processes through modifications of the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons [4,5]. Fig. 1 shows a representative Feynman diagram involving quartic vertices. An excess of events with respect to the SM predictions could indicate the presence of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs) [6].",

A second goal of this paper is to search for charged Higgs bosons that are produced via vector boson fusion (VBF) and decay to W and Z bosons. Proposals exist for extended Higgs sectors with additional SU(2) isotriplet scalars that give rise to charged Higgs bosons with couplings to W and Z bosons at the tree-level [24,25]. Specifically, the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model [26], with both real and complex triplets, preserves a global symmetry SU L (2) \u00d7SU R (2), which is broken by the Higgs vacuum expectation value to the diagonal subgroup SU L+R (2). Thus, the tree-level ratio of the W and Z boson masses is protected against large radiative corrections. In this model, singly (doubly) charged Higgs bosons are produced via VBF that decay to W and Z bosons (same-sign W boson pairs).",

The individual particles are identified as charged and neutral hadrons, leptons, and photons. The missing transverse momentum, p miss T , is defined as the magnitude of the negative vector p T sum of all reconstructed particles in the event. Its magnitude is denoted by p miss T . Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [48] with a distance parameter of 0.4, as implemented in the Fast-Jet package [49,50]. Jet momentum is determined as the sum of all particle momenta in the jet. Corrections are applied to the jet energy as a function of jet \u03b7 and p T to account for detector response nonlinearities, contribution from pileup, and residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and simulation [51,52]. Additional selection requirements remove spurious jets originating from isolated noise patterns in certain regions of the hadron calorimeter [53]. These corrections are also propagated to the p miss T calculation. The b quark jet identification criteria are based on a multivariate technique to combine the information from displaced tracks with the information from secondary vertices associated with the jet and on the possible presence of a soft muon in the event from the semileptonic decay of the b quark [54].",

The increase of the yield as a function of the aQGC exhibits a quadratic behavior, and a fitted parabolic function is used to interpolate between the discrete coupling parameters of Table 2 Expected yields from various background processes in WV and ZV final states. The combination of the statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown. The predicted yields are shown with their best-fit normalizations from the backgroundonly fit. The aQGC signal yields are shown for two aQGC scenarios with f T 2 / 4 = \u22120.5 TeV \u22124 and f T 2 / 4 = \u22122.5 TeV \u22124 for the WV and ZV channels, respectively. The charged Higgs boson signal yields are also shown for values of s H = 0.5 and m H5 = 500 GeV in the GM model. The statistical uncertainties are shown for the expected signal yields. the simulated signals. This is done for each bin of the mass distribution of the WV or ZV system. Table 3 shows the individual lower and upper limits obtained by setting all other aQGCs parameters to zero for the WV and ZV channels and their combination. These results give the most stringent constraints on the aQGC parameters for the S0, S1, M0, M1, M6, M7, T0, T1, and T2 operators. The effective field theory is not a complete model and the presence of nonzero aQGCs will violate tree-level unitarity at sufficiently high energy. It is important to note that the given limits do not include dipole form factors or other procedures to avoid unitarity violation [82]. Constraints on resonant charged Higgs boson production are also derived.

            "text": "A search for anomalous electroweak production of WW, WZ, and ZZ boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV was reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at 13 TeV. Final states with one or two leptons and a hadronically decaying W/Z boson, reconstructed as one large-radius jet, are considered. The contribution of the major background process W(Z)+jets in the WV (ZV) channel is evaluated with data control samples. No excess of events with respect to the SM background predictions is observed. Constraints on the quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of dimension-8 effective field theory operators are obtained. Stringent limits on the effective field theory operators S0, S1, M0, M1, M6, M7, T0, T1, and T2 are set. These are the first searches for anomalous electroweak production of WW, WZ, and ZZ boson pairs in WV and ZV semi-leptonic channels at 13 TeV. The limits improve the sensitivity of the current CMS fully leptonic results at 13 TeV [9,13,15 We congratulate our colleagues in the CERN accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the computing centers and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses. Finally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: BMBWF and FWF (Austria); FNRS and FWO (Belgium); CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, FAPERGS, and FAPESP   ",

Candidate events with a second opposite-charged and same flavor isolated lepton with p T > 30 GeV select the ZV \u2192 V decays. The candidate Z boson invariant mass must be within 15 GeV of the nominal Z boson mass [65]. The presence of additional muons or electron, with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 (2.5) for muons (electrons), satisfying less restrictive selection requirements than the signal lepton candidate selection and with average selection efficiencies above 95% [61,62], is used as a condition to further reduce events from the top quark and triboson background processes.

The longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum in WV \u2192 \u03bdV events is estimated by constraining the mass of the charged lepton and neutrino system to be the nominal W boson mass [65]. This is similar to the approach used in a previous CMS search [66]. The resulting quadratic equation is solved using p miss T as an estimate of the neutrino transverse momentum. The solution with the closest match to the longitudinal component of the charged lepton momentum is selected. Only the real part is considered if no real solution is found. The momentum of the W boson is then uniquely determined.Additional selection criteria are employed to enhance the sensitivity to aQGCs in the WV channel. The W and V bosons in the VBS and VBF topologies are mostly produced in the central rapidity region with respect to the two selected jets. Candidate events are required to have z *",
