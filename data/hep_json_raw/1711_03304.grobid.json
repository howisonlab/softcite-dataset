Using the high statistics data collected in 2010 on a transversely polarised proton target COMPASS has evaluated the transverse momentum weighted Sivers asymmetries both in xand in z-bins. The results are also compared with the standard unweighted asymmetries. Using the whole data sample collected over the years on transversely polarised deuteron and proton targets COMPASS has measured the transversity induced \u039b polarisation in the reaction \u03bcN \u2192 \u03bc \u039bX. Possible future SIDIS COMPASS measurements will also be briefly mentioned.",

By now, we have published a large number of results, and in this workshop several COMPASS contributions will cover the various facets of the hadron structure, namely the longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon in semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering (SIDIS), the transverse spin structure of the nucleon in SIDIS, in exclusive reactions, and in Drell-Yan scattering, and the hadron multiplicities in unpolarised SIDIS [1]. In this review I will shortly remind the most important results we have obtained on the transverse spin structure of the nucleon in SIDIS, then I will present our most recent work on the weighted Sivers asymmetries and on the \u039b polarisation, and I will conclude mentioning the future measurements we are planning.",

            "text": "The description of the nucleon structure in terms of collinear parton distributions functions (PDFs), i. e. distributions depending only on Bjorken x and the negative squared fourmomentum transfer Q 2 , has recently been generalized to take into account the parton transverse momentum k T . A complete picture of the nucleon at leading order needs a total of eight transverse momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs. After integration over the transverse momentum three of them reduce to the \"collinear\" PDFs, namely the number density, the helicity and the transversity distributions. The other five TMD PDFs are sensitive to the direction of the quark transverse momentum, they vanish when integrating over k T , and their measurement provides important information on the dynamics of the partons in the transverse plane in momentum space. Particularly interesting is the measurement of the SIDIS cross-section when the target nucleon is transversely polarised. In this case 8 (5 in case of unpolarised lepton beam) different spin-dependent azimuthal modulations of the produced hadrons are expected, from which invaluable information on the TMD PDFs can be extracted. All these target spin dependent azimuthal modulations have been investigated by the HERMES and COMPASS Collaborations in pioneering experiments. In particular, HERMES [2,3] and COMPASS [4,5,6] are up to now the only SIDIS experiments that have shown that the Sivers function [7], the transversity function and the Collins function [8] are different from zero. It is also of interest to remark that out of the 8 possible transverse spin azimuthal modulations in the SIDIS cross-section only the Collins and the Sivers asymmetries have been found to be different from zero, while the others have all been measured to be compatible with zero. And that there is no clear experimental evidence that the second T-odd TMD PDF, the so called Boer-Mulders function, which should show up in the azimuthal modulations of the unpolarised SIDIS cross-section, is different from zero. It has also to be added that the non-zero results for the asymmetries have been obtained scattering leptons on a proton target, while the corresponding asymmetries on a deuteron target (as measured by COMPASS) are compatible with zero [9,10], hinting at a cancellation between the u-and d-quarks PDFs.",

This dihadron asymmetry can be expressed as the product of the quark transversity distribution and a chiral-odd dihadron fragmentation function, which survives after integration over the two hadron momenta, and thus can be analyzed in the framework of collinear factorization. The mirror symmetry of the Collins asymmetry of positive and negative hadrons and the similarity between the positive hadron Collins asymmetry and the dihadron asymmetry suggested us an in-depth comparison between the two asymmetries. The conclusion of this investigation [11] was that both the single hadron and the dihadron transverse-spin dependent fragmentation functions are driven by the same elementary mechanism, which is very well described in the 3 P 0 recursive string fragmentation model [12].

Combined analysis of the proton and deuteron data soon allowed for first extractions of the Sivers function for u-and d-quarks [14,15,16,17], which turned out to be different from zero, with similar strength and opposite sign, a most important result in TMD physics.",

Now we know that both the u-and the d-quark transversity are different from zero, so it is possible to check whether there is any transfer of polarisation from them to the lambda, and obtain information on H \u039b/q 1 . Summing over all quark species, we get: where R is the rotation about the normal to the scattering plane which brings the initial proton momentum along the \u039b momentum [27]. \u039b hyperons are a natural choice to investigate such transversity transmitted polarisation: their weak decay channel \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 is in fact self-analysing, that is, the polarisation is revealed through the angular asymmetry of the decay proton:",
