The physics program was very successful with milestones such as the measurement of mixinginduced CPV in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03a8 K 0 S decays leading to the Noble Prize for Kobayashi and Maskawa in 2008 [1], the precise measurement of the CKM matrix elements [2], and the discovery of tetra quarks [3]. Its successor, the Belle II experiment, will soon start to record the first collisions. To allow for the envisaged 40-times higher peak luminosity, the collider and detector were upgraded. In addition, the Belle II Analysis Software Framework (BASF2) [4] was developed from scratch. An thorough validation of the software is necessary to ensure the integrity of upcoming analyses. In this article we describe the software package (b2bii) based on [5], which converts simulated and recorded Belle events into the Belle II format.",

The conversion process is visualized in Figure 1. The B2BIIMdstInput module opens the PANTHER-based Belle mDST files and reads the data event-by-event into the main memory. The data of the current event is represented in the memory by a series of PANTHER tables. The B2BIIFixMdst module applies various calibration factors onto the PANTHER tables, for instance on the beam-energy, the momenta and error matrices of the fitted tracks, the energy deposition in the ECL, and the particle identification information of the CDC and TOF. It also performs standard cuts to ensure that the selection of the detector data and simulated events is identical to the one obtained with BASF. Finally, \u03c0 0 candidates are reconstructed from the \u03b3 particle objects and the corrected ECL clusters. The index of each entry can be used to relate entries to other entries, for instance, to express a mother-daughter relationship between particles (a particle which decays inside the detector is called the mother of its decay-products, which are the daughters).",

Array objects are the equivalent to the tables used by PANTHER. The entries of different array objects can be connected by adding so-called relations, which are stored in a separate array object. The relations allow the expression of many-to-many connections between arbitrary entries of the array objects, for instance the relation between a track and the associated clusters: this allows the analyst to easily access all clusters which are associated to a given track. Single objects are used to store the remaining event-wise information, for instance the meta data of each event, or particle lists created by the analyst. A particle list is a list of Particle array entries used to organize the reconstruction of decay-chains in BASF2. BASF2 processes the data event-by-event, meaning the in-memory representation of most ROOT objects contains only a single event at a given point.

Often a reconstructed particle which misses final state radiation is considered as signal, whereas a reconstruction with a missing gamma is considered as wrong. A simple heuristic is applied to distinguish the two cases: Photons from a decay M \u2192 AB...\u03b3 are flagged as final state radiation, and photons from a decay M \u2192 A\u03b3 are flagged as gammas. In particular photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and D * \u2192 D\u03b3 are considered gammas.

Actually, there is no correct answer to the question of whether the photon is final state radiation or not. Hence, the behavior of the heuristic is not wrong, but probably unexpected by the analyst, because the initial state radiation amplitude dominates in this decay.3 BASF already implemented a function for recovering the lost bits, but it was apparently not applied.",
