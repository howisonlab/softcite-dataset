The observed hadronic energy in charged-current \u03bd\u00b5 interactions is combined with muon kinematics to permit separation of the quasielastic and \u2206(1232) resonance processes. First, we observe a small cross section at very low energy transfer that matches the expected screening effect of long-range nucleon correlations. Second, additions to the event rate in the kinematic region between the quasielastic and \u2206 resonance processes are needed to describe the data. The data in this kinematic region also has an enhanced population of multi-proton final states. Contributions predicted for scattering from a nucleon pair have both properties; the model tested in this analysis is a significant improvement but does not fully describe the data. We present the results as a double-differential cross section to enable further investigation of nuclear models. Improved description of the effects of the nuclear environment are required by current and future neutrino oscillation experiments.",

Fermi-gas models [1] are still widely used by neutrino experiments to describe the nuclear environment, but incorporate only simple proper-ties such as Fermi motion and Pauli blocking. Such models are unable to precisely describe high-statistics data for neutrino scattering from oxygen [2], carbon [3][4][5][6][7][8], and iron [9], especially for processes at low three-momentum transfer such as quasielastic (QE) and \u2206(1232) resonance production. The prevailing interpretation of these discrepancies is that more detailed nuclear models are required [10][11][12]. Uncertainties in nuclear modeling also impede investigation into fundamental quantities like the nucleon axial form factor.",

We use the measured hadronic energy to determine the full kinematics of an inclusive sample of interactions. These data from the MINERvA experiment exhibit a process with multiple protons in the final state, such as those predicted by scattering from two particles leaving two holes (2p2h), with energy transfer between the QE and \u2206 reactions [24,25]. Also, the cross section at low energy transfer is small, consistent with the effects of long range nucleon-nucleon correlations, such as those computed using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) technique [24,26,27]. In this Letter, we first present the analysis strategy and hadronic energy estimators, then the selection of the low three-momentum sample, comparison of the data and simulated events in reconstructed quantities, and the extraction of a doubledifferential cross section which will enable further comparisons to interaction models. The presence of a multinucleon component is confirmed by directly counting protons near the neutrino interaction point.",

Differences in the normalization of high and low energy samples are consistent with the energy-dependent uncertainties of the flux. An extreme case of zero 2p2h component above 5 GeV is disfavored by more than three standard deviations, with the muon energy scale being the largest systematic uncertainty. This favors the hypothesis that the apparent tension between MiniBooNE [5] and NO-MAD [3] arises from differences in selecting multi-proton final states, and not from strong neutrino energy dependent nuclear effects. The lack of energy dependence is also confirmation that the low-\u03bd method [50][51][52][53] may be effective in constraining the relative E \u03bd dependence of the neutrino flux, even with unmodeled nuclear effects.",

This is in contrast to the QE, \u2206, and coherent pion interactions which produce a single recoiling nucleon, nucleon and pion, and only a pion, respectively, before final state interactions (FSI). The Nieves model predicts [28] that proton plus neutron initial states are 50 to 80% of the total. The presence of additional protons was inferred from the energy spectrum of hadronic activity near the neutrino interaction point of QE events in an earlier MINERvA result [6]. Another observation of proton pairs is reported by ArgoNeuT [54]. Using a technique to effectively count protons, we find the data have more events with two or more observable protons in the final state, compared to the default model. This analysis identifies protons in MINERvA directly using the Bragg peak at the end of their range in scintillator: protons are likely to deposit 20 MeV or more in the scintillator strip where they stop (which may be the strip where the interaction occurred). We define a search region around the neutrino interaction point \u00b1170 mm in the beam direction and \u00b183 mm in the transverse direction. Pions and neutrons are likely to exit the search region or leave only low energy deposits. Simulated QE and \u2206 production events with a pion from the 0.4 < q 3 < 0.8 sample produce an average of 1.0 strips with activity more than 20 MeV in the interaction region. Two-nucleon events from the 2p2h process or \u2206 interactions that lose their pion to FSI produce an average of 1.6 and 1.5 strips with 20 MeV, respectively.",
