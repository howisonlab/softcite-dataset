The large B-meson production cross-section allows enough data to be collected to study the tiny effects of CP-violation in B systems. In particular, the results described in this paper cover measurements of the mixing phase \u03c6 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s , decay width difference \u2206\u0393 s , semileptonic asymmetry a sl s in the B s system and direct CP violation in the B s and B u systems.",

Angular analysis could be used to separate the CP components (see figure 1) and measure the lifetime of each component and phase \u03c6 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s [7]. Additional information on the initial state flavor of the B s meson helps resolve the sign ambiguity on \u03c6 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s for a given \u2206\u0393 s and improves the precision of results. The CDF collaboration used the data sample corresponding to 1.7 fb \u22121 (this result was updated recently using 2.8 fb \u22121 data sample [8]) and the D\u00d8 data sample corresponds to 2.8 fb \u22121 . Constraints on the strong phases \u03b4 i from the B d system allow the sign ambiguity on \u2206\u0393 s to be resolved (see recent theoretical work [9]).
