The QCD Lagrangian could contain a term, the \u03b8 term [1], that would give rise to CP violation in strong interactions; however, no strong CP violation has been observed. The experimental upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) implies a limit \u03b8 10 \u221210 [2]. The closeness of the value of \u03b8 to zero is seen as a fine-tuning problem, the so-called \"strong CP problem\". Solutions to the strong CP problem may involve axions [3], extra space-time dimensions [4], massless up quarks [5], string theory [6] or quantum gravity [7].",

In the Standard Model (SM) these decays could happen via the CP-violating weak interaction, through mediation by a virtual K 0 S meson, with expected branching fractions B \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221227 and B \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 < 4 \u00d7 10 \u221229 [8]. Based on the limit from the nEDM measurements, strong decays mediated by the \u03b8 term would have branching fractions below about 3 \u00d7 10 \u221217 [8]. Any observation of larger branching fractions would indicate a new source of CP violation in the strong interaction, which could help to solve the problem of the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The current limit for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode, B \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level (CL), comes from the KLOE experiment [9], which looked for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the decay \u03c6(1020) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 .

The BDT is trained using a sample of 820 000 simulated D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events for the signal, generated uniformly in phase space, and about 10 7 background candidates obtained from sidebands of width 20 MeV/c 2 on each side of the D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass peak in the data.",
