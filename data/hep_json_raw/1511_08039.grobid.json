The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb \u22121 recorded with the LHCb detector. The bosons are identified in the W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd and Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channels. The cross-sections are measured for muons in the pseudorapidity range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5, with transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV/c and, in the case of the Z boson, a dimuon mass within 60 < M \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 120 GeV/c 2 . The results are \u03c3 W + \u2192\u00b5 + \u03bd = 1093.6 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 7.2 \u00b1 10.9 \u00b1 12.7 pb , \u03c3 W \u2212 \u2192\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd = 818.4 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 5.0 \u00b1 7.0 \u00b1 9.5 pb ,",

The dominant uncertainty on these predictions reflects the uncertainties on the parton density functions (PDFs). The forward acceptance of the LHCb detector allows the PDFs to be constrained at Bjorken-x values down to 10 \u22124 [6]. Ratios of the W and Z cross-sections provide precise tests of the SM as the sensitivity to the PDFs in the theoretical calculations is reduced and many of the experimental uncertainties cancel.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with JHEP01(2016)155 a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of a scintillating-pad detector (SPD), preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [20], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. A requirement that prevents events with high occupancy from dominating the processing time of the software trigger is also applied. This is referred to in this article as the global event cut (GEC).",

To define a degree of isolation, a cone with radius R = \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c6 2 = 0.5 is constructed around the direction of the muon track. Excluding the candidate muon momentum, requiring that there are small amounts of transverse momentum (p cone T < 2 GeV/c) and transverse energy (E cone T < 2 GeV) in the cone reduces background originating from generic QCD events. Requiring the transverse momentum of all other muons in the event to be less than 2 GeV/c reduces the contamination from Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events. An upper limit on the IP of 40 \u00b5m removes candidates in which the muon is not consistent with originating from the primary vertex. Such candidates could be due to electroweak boson decays to tau leptons, which in turn decay to muons, or semileptonic decays of heavy flavour hadrons. Genuine muons are expected to leave lowenergy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. An upper limit of 4% on the amount of energy that is deposited in the calorimeters relative to the momentum of the track (E calo /pc) reduces the background from energetic pions and kaons punching through the calorimeters to the muon stations.

Only muons with p T smaller than 70 GeV/c are considered. The W \u00b1 boson signal and the Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 background templates are based on distributions predicted by the ResBos generator. The Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd templates are taken from Pythia 8 simulation. The overall fraction of the electroweak background (Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays) in the W boson candidate sample is determined using a data-driven method to be (10.84 \u00b1 0.21)%. A template for backgrounds due to misidentified hadrons is taken from data using a sample of randomly triggered pions and kaons that are weighted by their probability to be misidentified as muons. This component is left free to vary in the fit, and is determined to account for about 9.6% of the total candidates. Finally, a template of heavy-flavour decays is obtained from data using muons with an IP of more than 100 \u00b5m. The fraction of this background is determined from a fit to the muon IP distribution and is found to be (1.31 \u00b1 0.09)% of the W boson candidate sample. The momentum calibration for high-p T muons is performed using the data-driven technique outlined in ref. [44]. A more detailed description of the fit implementation is given in ref. [8]. The fit result in the full \u03b7 \u00b5 range is presented in figure 1 (left), where the normalised residuals show an imperfect description of the data by the adopted templates, similar to the 7 TeV analysis. The effect of this discrepancy on the signal yield is at the few per mille level. The overall purities are \u03c1 W + = (78.91 \u00b1 0.15)% and \u03c1 W \u2212 = (77.49 \u00b1 0.18)%.",

The tag and the probe tracks are required to satisfy the fiducial requirements. The tag must be identified as a muon and be consistent with triggering the event, while the probe is defined so that it is unbiased with respect to the requirement for which the efficiency is being measured. The efficiency is studied as a function of several variables, which include both the muon momenta and the detector occupancy. In this analysis, reconstruction, identification and trigger efficiencies are applied as a function of the muon pseudorapidity. The efficiency in each bin of \u03b7 \u00b5 is defined as the fraction of tag-and-probe candidates where the probe satisfies the corresponding track reconstruction, identification or trigger requirement. All efficiencies are observed to be independent of the muon charge.",

An alternative definition for the QCD background template, potential mismodelling of the lepton p T shape in Pythia for events that contain jets, and the normalisations of the background templates are accounted for with additional uncertainties. The total uncertainties on the W + and W \u2212 integrated cross-sections from the sample purity are 0.28% and 0.21%. For the Z boson sample, the systematic uncertainty on the purity is determined by considering alternative definitions of the heavy-flavour background samples, and by varying by their uncertainties the probabilities for hadrons to be misidentified as muons. In addition, an uncertainty accounting for the assumption that the purity is the same for all variables and bins of the analysis is evaluated by comparing to cross-section measurements using a binned purity, rather than a global one.

The large degree of correlation between the uncertainties allows for sub-percent determination of the cross-section ratios. These represent the most precise determinations to date of electroweak boson production at the LHC. Using previous results from the \u221a s = 7 TeV data set, the evolution with the centre-of-mass energy is studied. Good agreement between measured and predicted cross-section ratios is observed. The experimental uncertainties are dominated by luminosity uncertainties of about 1.5%. Double ratios of cross-sections at different centre-of-mass energies are independent of the luminosity and are thus a more precise class of observables, determined with precision of between 0.7% and 0.9%. In the cross-section ratios, the predictions deviate slightly from the measurements. Such deviations can be expected in BSM extensions that feature new sources of W and Z production. This motivates the extension of this analysis to higher energies, as will be possible with future data.",
