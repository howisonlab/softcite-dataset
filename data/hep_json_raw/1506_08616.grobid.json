Most of the analyses use 20 fb \u22121 of collisions at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, although in some case an additional 4.7 fb \u22121 of collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV are used. New analyses are introduced to improve the sensitivity to specific regions of the model parameter space. Since no evidence of third-generation squarks is found, exclusion limits are derived by combining several analyses and are presented in both a simplified model framework, assuming simple decay chains, as well as within the context of more elaborate phenomenological supersymmetric models.",

In many supersymmetric models, the large Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs sector makes the Higgs boson mass sensitive to the masses of the scalar top (referred to as stop in the following) states, such that, to avoid fine tuning, their masses are often required to be light. Thet R andt L components mix to form the mass eigenstatest 1 andt 2 ,t 1 being defined as the lighter of the two. The scalar superpartner of the lefthanded chiral component of the bottom quark (b L ) belongs to the same weak isospin doublet as thet L , hence they usually share the same supersymmetry-breaking mass parameter: a light stop can therefore imply the existence of a light scalar bottom. The lightest sbottom mass eigenstate is referred to asb 1 .",

These searches have found no evidence of third-generation squark signals, leading to exclusion limits in many SUSY models. The aim of this paper is to sum-marise the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to R-parityconserving 1  [38][39][40][41][42] models including the direct pair production of stops and sbottoms using the full \u221a s = 8 TeV proton-proton collision dataset collected during Run 1 of the LHC. 2 The third-generation squarks are assumed to decay to the stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) directly or through one or more intermediate stages. The analyses considered are those previously published by the ATLAS collaboration on the topic, together with new ones designed to increase the sensitivity to scenarios not optimally covered so far. A wide range of SUSY scenarios are studied by combining different analyses to improve the global sensitivity.",

Two different types of models have been considered: simplified models, where the third-generation squarks are assumed to decay into typically one or two different final states, and more complex phenomenological supersymmetric models, where the stop and sbottom have many allowed decay channels. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. 6.",

Appendix A briefly summarises the layout of the ATLAS detector and the general principles used in the reconstruction of electrons, muons, jets, jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets), and the missing transverse momentum vector p miss T (whose magnitude is referred to as E miss T ). Appendix B discusses the analyses used to derive the exclusion limits presented in Sects. 4 and 5. The analyses that have already been published are only briefly reviewed, while those presented for the first time in this paper are discussed in detail. Appendix C provides further details of a combination of analyses which is performed for the first time in this paper. Finally, Appendix D provides details about the generation and simulation of the signal Monte Carlo samples used to derive the limits presented. 1 It is also assumed that the decay of the third-generation squarks is prompt: long-lived and metastable stops/sbottoms are discussed elsewhere [36,37]. 2 The analysis exploiting the measurement of the tt cross section discussed in this paper also uses 4.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV.",

However, this assumption can be relaxed, and exclusion limits derived as a function of the branching ratio of thet 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 decay, BR(t 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ), assuming that BR(t 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ) + BR(t 1 \u2192 b f f \u03c7 0 1 ) = 1. Two different scenarios, with m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) = 10, 80 GeV, are considered. The first compressed scenario is characterised by lowp T stop decay products, and the set of signal regions which have sensitivity is the tc-M, independently of the decay of the stop. In the second scenario, the phase space available for thet 1 decay is larger, and the full set of tc-M, tc-C, t1L-bCa_low, t1L-bCa_med and WW-SR selections have different sensitivity, depending on BR(t 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ). The cross-section limit is derived by combining the analyses discussed above. The SR giving the lowest expected exclusion CL s for each signal model and for each value of BR(t \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ) is chosen. Figure 5 shows the result of these combinations. For m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) = 10 GeV, the sensitivity is completely dominated by the tc-M signal regions, hence no significant dependence on BR(t \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ) is observed. In this case, stop masses up to about 250 GeV are excluded. For m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) = 80 GeV, the sensitivity is dominated by the tc-C signal regions at high values of BR(t \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ). For lower values of BR(t \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 ), the \"soft-lepton\" and WW signal regions both become competitive, the latter yielding a higher sensitivity at smaller Table 1 Summary of the ATLAS analyses and signal regions used in this paper.

The expected limit on the stop mass is about 50 GeV higher at low m\u03c70 1 than in the individual analyses. The observed limit is increased by roughly the same amount and stop masses between 200 and 700 GeV are excluded for small neutralino masses. 5 A similar combination is performed to target a scenario where the stop can decay ast 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 with branching ratio x and ast 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 with branching ratio 1 \u2212 x.

The inner detector (ID), in combination with a superconducting solenoid magnet with a central field of 2 T, provides precision tracking and momentum measurements of charged particles in a pseudorapidity 10 range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ID consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector and a straw tube tracker (|\u03b7| < 2.0) that also provides transition radiation measurements for electron identification. A high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeter system, with acceptance covering |\u03b7| < 3.2, uses liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium. A scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage for |\u03b7| < 1.7. The end-cap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with LAr electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The muon spectrometer has separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers which provide trigger coverage for |\u03b7| < 2.4 and muon identification and momentum measurements for |\u03b7| < 2.7.",

The uncertainty is derived following the same methodology as that detailed in Ref. [92]. Events used in the analyses presented in this paper were selected using the ATLAS three-level trigger following different chains based on the signatures being considered. A common set of cleaning cuts, aimed at rejecting events heavily contaminated by non-collision backgrounds, or events containing badly measured or fake jets is applied to all analyses. The experimental signature of third-generation supersymmetric particles includes the production of b-jets in association with missing transverse momentum and possibly additional jets and charged leptons. Different signatures are investigated in this paper to gain sensitivity to a variety of possible topologies arising from the production and decay of stops and sbottoms. Different event selections share common definitions of the final reconstructed objects, which are detailed in the remainder of this Appendix. Analysis-specific departures from those definitions are detailed for each case in Appendix B or in the specific analysis paper.",

Several criteria, including calorimeter shower shape, quality of the match between the track and the cluster, and the amount of transition radiation emitted in the TRT detector, are used to define three selections with decreasing efficiency and increasing purity, named respectively 'loose', 'medium' and 'tight' [104]. These three electron selections are used throughout this paper in the definitions of various signal and control regions.

The main background is given by SM processes containing two W bosons in the final state (mainly tt and W W ) [18]. To discrimi-nate the stop signal from the SM background, the stransverse mass variable m T2 [107,108] is used. The stransverse mass, computed using the two leptons as visible particles and the missing transverse momentum vector, exhibits a kinematical end-point at m W for most SM processes. Because of the presence of additional E miss T due to the LSP, the end-point for a SUSY signal can be at larger values, depending on the mass separation between the particles involved in the decay.

To derive exclusion limits, five signal regions (t2L) have been defined, requiring different jet multiplicities and different m T2 thresholds. A selection requiring two b-jets and based on m T2 computed using them as visible particles is sensitive to the chargino decay mode with m(t 1 ,\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) > m t .

The main difference with respect to the scenario considered in Ref. [65] is that the three-body decay tends to yield b-jets with lower p T , leading to a fitted b for the combined sample which is different from that expected for tt events alone. The limits obtained are summarised in Fig. 16 for a neutralino mass of 1 GeV. A 95 % CL limit that excludes stop masses below 175 GeV is obtained. The figure also shows the effect on the limit of a \"sneaky top squark\" scenario [111]: the presence of at 1 with mass similar to that of the top quark could bias the measurement of the top-quark mass itself. The bias in the top-mass measurement introduced by the existence of at 1 with mass mt 1 = 170 GeV depends on the analysis technique and channel, and was evaluated to be at most 1 GeV for the two-and three-dimensional template techniques used in the ATLAS top mass measurement in the lepton+jets channel [112]. The effect of a potential bias of 1 and 2.5 GeV on the top-mass measurement was studied by recalculating the observed 95 % CL limit on \u03bc when reducing the predicted SM tt production cross section from the baseline value of m t = 172.5 \u00b1 1.0 GeV to those obtained for top mass central values of 173.5 and 175 GeV. The corresponding limit on the stop mass is reduced by about 5 and 15 GeV, respectively.",

The CR for W W production (CRW) is defined by m T2 > 35 GeV, X > 0.04, and has a purity of 72 %.

Their classification and estimation follows closely those defined in Ref. [18]. A few differences, discussed in the following, exist on the estimation of the theory-related uncertainties. The total uncertainty on the yield of the W W production process is composed of three terms: the uncertainty on the NLO hard-scattering calculation is taken to be the difference between the prediction of POWHEG and aMC@NLO both using PYTHIA for the parton shower; the uncertainty addressing the choice of the parton-shower model is estimated as the difference of the aMC@NLO predictions showered either with HERWIG or PYTHIA; the uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scale is evaluated by changing the scales independently by a factor of two or one-half and taking the maximum difference. The estimated relative uncertainties on the signal region yields are about 6 % in SR1-SR4 and SR6; 11 % in SR7 and 29 % in SR5. Similar comparisons performed on the W Z and Z Z process yield uncertainties ranging from 30 to 45 % depending on the signal region considered. Additional systematic uncertainties are assigned to the small expected yields from Z + jets production (80 %), W t (50-100 % depending on the SR considered), and non-prompt lepton background. The values of the normalisation factors obtained when performing the fit to the control regions only are shown in Table 5.",

These limits are also reported in Table 7. Finally, 95 % CL exclusion limits are derived in specific supersymmetric models of direct pair production of stops.

The specific choices made for the p T and pseudorapidity thresholds and working points of the final-state objects, as well as the trigger selection, are the same as those in Ref. [120].

The categorisation is also used to reweight the different flavour components of the tt+jets background to obtain a better modelling. These categorisation and reweighting procedures are discussed in detail in Ref. [120]. In particular, the tt + bb component, which is simulated with POWHEG, is reweighted to a full NLO calculation [121] performed in SHERPA 1.4.1+OpenLoops [122,123]. The reweighting is done at generator level using a number of kinematic variables such as the top quark p T , tt system p T , R and p T of the dijet system not coming from the top-quark decay. A different reweighting is applied to the tt + cc and tt+ lightjets components, which is based on the ratio of the differential cross sections at \u221a s = 7 TeV obtained in data and simulation as a function of the top quark p T and tt system p T [124].",

All samples are produced with a varying number of simulated minimum-bias interactions overlaid on the hard-scattering event to account for multiple pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup).
