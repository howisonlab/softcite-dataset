Reactors have played a major role in the study of neutrino oscillations, a phenomenon that indicates that neutrinos have mass and that neutrino flavours are quantum mechanical mixtures. Over the past several decades, reactors were used in the discovery of neutrinos, were crucial in solving the solar neutrino puzzle, and allowed the determination of the smallest mixing angle y 13 . In the near future, reactors will help to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to solve the puzzling issue of sterile neutrinos. N eutrinos, the products of radioactive decay among other things, are somewhat enigmatic, since they can travel enormous distances through matter without interacting even once. Understanding their properties in detail is fundamentally important. Notwithstanding that they are so very difficult to observe, great progress in this field has been achieved in recent decades. The study of neutrinos is opening a path for the generalization of the so-called Standard Model that explains most of what we know about elementary particles and their interactions, but in the view of most physicists is incomplete.",

Since weak interactions are the only way neutrinos interact with anything, the un-needed right-handed components of the neutrino field are absent in the Model by definition and neutrinos are assumed to be massless, with the individual lepton number (that is, the number of leptons of a given flavour or family) being strictly conserved. This assignment was supported by the lack of observation of decays like m \u00fe ! e \u00fe \u00fe g or K L ! e AE \u00fe m \u00c7 , despite the long search for them.",

That discovery represents one of the very few instances that show that the Standard Model is indeed incomplete. The phenomenon of neutrino oscillations means that neutrinos have a finite mass, albeit very small, and that lepton flavour is not a conserved quantity. Box 1 explains the basic physics of neutrino oscillations and their relation with neutrino masses, and introduces the parameters used in the oscillation formalism. Determination of all their values, with ever increasing accuracy, was and continues to be the main goal of neutrino experiments. The current experimental values of the mass-squared differences Dm 2 ij and the mixing angles y ij can be found in the latest editions of the Review of Particle Physics 1 and is also shown in Box 1. Historically, the concept of neutrino oscillations was first considered by Pontecorvo 2,3 and by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata 4 , hence the neutrino mixing matrix is usually called the PMNS matrix.",

Similarly, if a positively charged muon (m \u00fe ) is produced in the decay of the meson p \u00fe , the muon neutrino (n m ) is always produced as well. However, if neutrinos have a finite mass, the flavour composition of a neutrino beam could vary regularly as a function of the distance and energy.

Traditionally, such measurements were compared with the expected n e spectrum of the reactor.

These electron spectra are then transformed into the n e spectra using the obvious fact that these two leptons share the total energy of each b-decay branch. The transformation is on the basis of fitting first the electron spectra to a set of 30 or more virtual branches, with the equidistant end point spacing, determining from the fit their branching ratios. The conversion to the n e spectrum is performed in each of these virtual branches. That conversion is based on the assumption that the electron spectrum is known precisely. When all virtual branches are put together, one has to also take into account that different nuclear charges Z contribute with different weights to different electron and n e energies.

It appeared that more than half of the solar neutrinos were missing. This was referred to as the 'Solar Neutrino Problem'.

The vertical overburden is 2,700 metre water equivalent (m.w.e.). It is surrounded by 55 Japanese nuclear reactor cores, which then produced B30% of the total electricity in Japan. The n e fluxweighted average baseline is B180 km, well suited for KamLAND to study the parameters suggested by the solar neutrino experiments. The reactor operation information such as thermal power, fuel burn-up and fuel exchange, and enrichment records, were provided by all Japanese reactors, which allowed KamLAND to calculate the instantaneous fission rate of each isotope accurately.",

Even with such powerful reactor n e sources and a massive detector, the long baseline suppresses the expected signal at KamLAND to only about one reactor n e event per day. In comparison, the background from internal and external radioactivity is one million times higher. The experiment is only possible owing to the powerful coincidence signature (the positron followed by the delayed neutron capture g) of inverse beta decay, as illustrated in Fig. 2. A time difference of less than 1 ms and distance less than 2 m between the prompt and delayed signals is required in the analysis. Only the innermost 6-m-radius scintillator region is used to reduce the accidental coincidence from external radioactivity. Information about the event energy, position and time was used to further reduce the accidental background to B5% of the candidates.",

It is then captured by a proton B200 ms later and releases a 2.2-MeV g-ray (the capture time can be significantly reduced by the doping of isotopes with very large neutron capture cross-section such as gadolinium). The detection of this prompt-delayed signal pair indicates an n e candidate. neutron emitters 9 Li and 8 He; the fast neutrons from muons passing through the surrounding rock; as well as atmospheric neutrinos. Figure 3a shows the prompt energy spectrum of n e candidate events, observed with 2.9 kton \u00c1 year exposure, overlaid with the expected reactor n e and background spectra. A total of 1,609 events were observed, which is only B60% of the expected signal if there are no oscillations. The ratio of the backgroundsubtracted n e candidate events to no-oscillation expectation is plotted in Fig. 3b as a function of L/E n . The spectrum indicates almost two cycles of the periodic feature expected from neutrino oscillations, strongly disfavouring other explanations of the n e disappearance.",

            "text": "A common technology used in both the first-and secondgeneration experiments is the gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator as the n e detection target. Gd has a high thermal neutron capture cross-section. With B0.1% gadolinium loading, the neutron capture time is reduced to B28 from B200 ms for the unloaded scintillator (as used in KamLAND). Furthermore, Gd de-excitation after the neutron capture releases an 8-MeV gamma-ray cascade, which gives a delayed signal well above natural radioactivity (in contrast, neutron capture on a proton releases a single 2.2-MeV g). The accidental coincidence background is therefore drastically reduced.  Addition of near detectors at baselines of a few hundred metres is the most significant improvement of the second-generation experiments over the previous ones. As discussed above, the uncertainty in predicting the reactor antineutrino flux is relatively large (2-5%). This flux uncertainty, however, can be largely eliminated by the relative measurement between near and far detectors. The Double Chooz experiment expands CHOOZ by adding a near detector at a distance of B400 m. The installation of that near detector, however, was delayed because of civil construction. Double Chooz started taking data in May 2011 with only a far detector, and used the Bugey4 measurement 14 to normalize the reactor flux. The RENO experiment was built near the six reactors of the Yonggwang nuclear power plant (NPP) in Korea. The two identical detectors were located at 290 and 1,380 m, respectively, from the centre of the reactor array. RENO started taking data in August 2011. The Daya Bay experiment was built near the six reactors of the Daya Bay NPP in southern China. Daya Bay had eight identical antineutrino detectors (ADs). Two ADs were placed at B360 m from the two Daya Bay reactor cores. Two ADs were placed at B500 m from the four Ling Ao reactor cores. Moreover, four ADs were placed at a far site B1,580 m away from the six-reactor complex. This modular detector design allows Daya Bay to largely remove the correlated detector systematics. Daya Bay started taking data in December 2011.",

In 2012, all three experiments, Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO, reported clear evidence of n e disappearance at Bkilometre baselines after only a few month's running 20,22,23 . In particular, Daya Bay excluded y 13 \u00bc 0 by 5.2 s.d. with 55 days of data 20 . Figure 4a shows the result of this discovery. The ratio of the detected to expected no-oscillation n e signals at the six detectors located in the three experimental halls is plotted as a function of weighted baseline. The signal rate at the far site shows an obvious B6% deficit with respect to the near sites, and fits nicely to the theoretical oscillation curve (in red). The precision of   the y 13 measurement improved quickly with more data. With the data collected in Daya Bay through November 2013 (ref. 57), the best-fit value is sin 2 2y 13 \u00bc 0.084\u00b10.005. Although the last known, the precision in y 13 measurement (6%) is now the best among all three mixing angles. Similar to KamLAND, the ratio of the detected n e events to no-oscillation expectation at Daya Bay is plotted in Fig. 4b as a function of L/E n . The combined data from the three experimental halls show a near-complete cycle of the expected periodic oscillation feature. The smaller amplitude and shorter wavelength of the oscillation, compared with the case of KamLAND, indicate the different oscillation component driven by y 13 and Dm 2 31 . The best-fit frequency of the oscillation yields Dm 2",

The difference between the baselines to the two NPPs is controlled to less than 500 m to prevent significant degradation of the MH discrimination power 63 . JUNO is expected to start data taking in 2020. The proposed RENO-50 (ref. 26) experiment will be located in the city of Naju, B47 km from the Hanbit NPP with six cores of 2.8 GW th each. The detector will be placed at underground of Mt. Guemseong with an overburden of 900 m.w.e. RENO-50 is expected to begin data taking in 2021.",

In the following we will primarily use JUNO as an example to illustrate the significant challenges in building such a large experiment. The preliminary design of JUNO includes a central detector submerged in a water pool with the muon trackers installed on top of the pool. The water pool is equipped with PMTs and acts as an active Cherenkov detector for vetoing muons. It also provides passive shielding against the natural radioactivities from the surrounding rock and air. The top trackers provide complementary measurements of the cosmic muons. The central detector consists of 20 kton of LS, contained either in a spherical acrylic tank supported by stainless steel frames, or a thin transparent balloon contained in a stainless steel vessel. The detector looks similar to the one in SNO or KamLAND, but is 20 times larger. In order to collect enough light, the central detector is viewed by B18,000 20-inch PMTs. The PMTs have implosion containers to mitigate the risk of implosion chain reactions. Taking into account the mechanical clearance, the PMTs provide a near maximal surface coverage of 75-78%. RENO-50 has a similar detector design with 18-kt LS and 15,000 20-inch PMTs.",

The light yield and the optical transparency of the LS also need to be improved.

The 9 Li and 8 He isotopes are mostly produced by the muons accompanied by large electromagnetic or hadronic showers 68 . In KamLAND, if a shower muon is tagged, the whole detector is vetoed for 2 s. Such a veto strategy will lead to a significant signal loss at JUNO and RENO-50. Since the lateral distance of the isotopes from the parent muon trajectory is approximately exponential 68 , a small veto region along the muon track can efficiently remove the background with minimal loss of signals. Thus, the ability to track the shower muons is essential, which demands new developments in the muon veto system and improvements on the simulations and reconstructions.",

            "text": "The LSND anomaly indicates the existence of additional fourth or more neutrino families with masses mB1 eV. Since these additional neutrinos cannot couple to Z bosons, they must lack weak interactions and are therefore sterile. Sterile neutrinos are observable only through their sub-dominant mixing with the familiar active neutrinos. The light sterile neutrinos, coincidentally, are also among the leading candidates to resolve outstanding puzzles in astrophysics and cosmology [81][82][83][84] . On the other hand, the light sterile neutrinos are generally not 'natural' in the theories that extend the neutrino Standard Model. For example, the popular type-I see-saw model [85][86][87][88] , which provides an elegant explanation of the small neutrino masses and the matterantimatter asymmetry of the universe 89 , predicts only heavy sterile neutrinos (m410 10 eV). If the light sterile neutrinos indeed exist, as LSND indicates, they would suggest new frontiers in both experimental and theoretical physics.",

            "text": "The LSND anomaly so-far remains experimentally unconfirmed, despite many efforts. However, there are several hints supporting LSND's findings, even though none are really conclusive. The MiniBooNE experiment, designed at a similar L/E baseline as LSND using accelerator neutrinos, observed event excess in the n m -n e and n m ! n e appearance channels that have been interpreted as consistent with LSND 90,91 . The GALLEX 92 and the SAGE 93 solar neutrino experiments, during their calibrations using intense neutrino sources ( 51 Cr, 37 Ar), observed an B24% event deficit in the n e disappearance channel. This deficit is often referred to as the 'Gallium anomaly'. Recently, re-evaluations of the reactor n e flux resulted in an increase in the predicted n e rate 37,39 (see earlier sections for details). Combining the new predictions with the reactor experimental data at baselines between 10 and 100 m (refs 9-15) suggests an B4-6% deficit between the measured and predicted reactor n e flux, so-called 'reactor antineutrino anomaly' 27,94 . These experimental anomalies can be interpreted by light-sterile neutrinos 95 , but might also be caused by an imperfect knowledge of the theoretical predictions or experimental systematics. The preferred region (Dm 2 B1 eV 2 and sin 2 2yB0.1), however, is in some tension with the limits derived from other appearance [96][97][98][99] or disappearance searches 15,[100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107] . There is, therefore, a strong motivation, despite the rather confusing present experimental status, to search for the lightsterile neutrinos. This led to a high-priority world-wide programme 108 with many proposed next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments. Different technologies will be used, including short-baseline accelerator experiments [109][110][111][112][113] with various neutrino beams, 51 Cr ( 144 Ce-144 Pr) n e n e \u00f0 \u00de source experiments [114][115][116][117] near or inside large LS detectors, as well as very short-baseline (B10 m) reactor (VSBR) n e experiments. In order to unambiguously resolve the LSND anomaly, the oscillation pattern in the L=E space need to be observed, as in KamLAND (Fig. 3) and Daya Bay (Fig. 4). VSBR experiments provide unique opportunities to do so, given the many advantages provided by reactors.",

Table 2 summarizes some of the key parameters of the proposed VSBR experiments. The oscillation length of the B1-eV mass-scale sterile neutrinos is B10 m for reactor n e 's; thus, all proposed experiments deploy their detectors at distances of 4-20 m from the reactor cores. The reactor cores should preferably be compact in size to minimize the oscillations inside the cores; therefore, most experiments utilize compact research reactors with thermal power of tens of megawatts. Those research reactors are typically highly enriched in 235 U, in contrast to the commercial reactors in the NPPs.",

The cosmic-ray-related background is therefore high. One advantage of using research reactors is that they can be turned on or off on demand, which helps to measure the nonreactor background. The reactor-related backgrounds, such as fast neutrons and high-energy gamma rays, are however more difficult to determine as they appear together with the n e signals. Sufficient active veto and passive shielding are necessary. However, given the tight space near the reactor cores, they have to be carefully designed.",

The Gd-LS technology is mature and a good pulse shape discrimination against the neutron background has been demonstrated. An advantage of the 6 Li-loaded scintillator is that the delayed neutron capture process 6 Li(n, a)t produces an a particle and a triton, instead of a g-ray. This provides a good localization of the delayed signal and an additional pulse shape discrimination against the g-background. Some detectors are highly segmented into small cells in order to achieve good position resolution and further background rejection by using the multicell event topologies. There are, however, more inactive layers in the segmented detectors; therefore, the edge effects have to be accurately simulated and measured. It is also more challenging to perform calibrations and control the relative variations among cells for the segmented detectors. For all detectors, sufficient light yield is required to precisely measure the reactor n e spectrum and the possible distortions from neutrino oscillations.",

The expected flavour composition of the reactor neutrino flux, for neutrinos of 4 MeV energy used as an example, is plotted as a function of distance to the reactor cores. The fraction of neutrino flavours is calculated on the basis of the neutrino oscillation theory introduced in Box 1. Reactor neutrino oscillation experiments are placed at different baselines to measure the oscillation features driven by different mechanisms. The experiments are usually categorized as follows: very short-baseline (LB10 m); short-baseline (LB100 m); kilometre-baseline (LB1 km); medium-baseline (LB50 km); and long-baseline (L4100 km) experiments. Details of the past and future reactor experiments, their goals and achievements are the main topics of this Review.",

In the bottom of the figure, the reactor n e flux from the individual isotopes37,39 , weighted by their typical contribution to the total flux in a commercial reactor, is shown. The detection of n e relies on the inverse beta decay reaction, whose crosssection41,42 is shown as the blue curve. Their product is the interaction spectrum measured by the detectors, shown as the red curve. The steps involved in the detection are schematically drawn in the top of the figure.The n e interacts with a proton, becoming a positron (e \u00fe ) and a neutron. The e \u00fe quickly deposits its energy and annihilates into two 511-keV g-rays, which gives a prompt signal. The neutron scatters in the detector until being thermalized. It is then captured by a proton B200 ms later and releases a 2.2-MeV g-ray (the capture time can be significantly reduced by the doping of isotopes with very large neutron capture cross-section such as gadolinium). The detection of this prompt-delayed signal pair indicates an n e candidate.",
