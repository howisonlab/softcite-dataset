This process is significantly lower in rate than neutrino-induced charged-current coherent pion production, because of Cabibbo suppression and a kinematic suppression due to the larger kaon mass. We search for such events in the scintillator tracker of MINERvA by observing the final state K + , \u00b5 \u2212 and no other detector activity, and by using the kinematics of the final state particles to reconstruct the small momentum transfer to the nucleus, which is a model-independent characteristic of coherent scattering. We find the first experimental evidence for the process at 3\u03c3 significance.",

            "text": "Charged mesons may be produced in inelastic, coherent charged-current reactions of neutrinos. This reaction is believed to occur when an off-shell W boson fluctuates to a meson. The meson is brought on the mass shell by exchange of a particle carrying no quantum numbers with the target nucleus, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Charged pion production through this mechanism has been observed and measured with O(10)% precision on nuclei ranging from carbon to argon and across a range of neu-trino (and antineutrino) energies from a few GeV to tens of GeV [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. If the mechanism described above is the source of these events, then there should be an analogous, Cabibbo-suppressed process in which a K \u00b1 meson is produced. In this Letter, we report the first experimental evidence of this process.",

The meson-nucleus elastic cross section and its exponential decrease with increasing |t| are parameterized from meson-nucleus scattering data [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Models must be used to extrapolate away from Q 2 = 0. The model most commonly used in neutrino event generators [14][15][16][17] is that of Rein and Sehgal [12], which assumes no vector current and extrapolates the axial-vector current using a multiplicative dipole form factor F 2 dipole (Q 2 ) = 1/(1 + Q 2 /m 2 A ) 2 to modify Eq. 1. Other authors have proposed alternate extrapolations away from Q 2 = 0 [13,[18][19][20]. At low energies, modifications to Eq. 1 due to finite masses become important, restricting the allowed kinematics to [21,22]. This restriction on |t| removes more phase space for kaon production than it does for pion production due to the larger meson mass, m M . An alternate approach is to start with the Cabibbo-suppressed single kaon production cross section on nucleons [23] at low neutrino energies and calculate a coherent sum [24].",

Even in PCAC models, the dearth of data on low energy K + -nucleus elastic scattering at the relevant kaon energies [25,26] precludes a precise calculation. However, the rate in the signal model does not affect the result, and in fact the model is only needed to determine energy deposited near the interaction point and the distribution of |t|, and both of those quantities are most affected by well-modeled detector resolutions. Therefore, we generate coherent pion production with genie 2.8.4 [14] and recalculate hadronic kinematics while holding the lepton kinematics and magnitude of the four-momentum transfer to the nucleus fixed. The larger kaon mass means there is only a physical solution for 26% of pion events for MINERvA's neutrino flux. The rate is also reduced by a factor of (f K /f \u03c0 )",

The ratio of the K + to \u03c0 + elastic scattering cross sections on carbon is calculated to be \u223c 0.7 [28], consistent with measurements at higher meson energies [25]. We therefore expect our flux-averaged cross section for coherent K + production to be \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 41 cm 2 per carbon nucleus. The signal reaction produces events with a forward K + and \u00b5 \u2212 and no additional energy near the vertex. Processes that produce the same final state, but often with additional low energy particles at the interaction vertex and with large |t|, are simulated using the genie 2.8.4 neutrino event generator [14]. Inelastic reactions for W < 1.7 GeV are simulated with a tuned model of discrete baryon resonance production [29]. The transition to deep inelastic scattering is simulated using the Bodek-Yang model [30]. Hadronization at higher energies is simulated with the AGKY model [31] based on the gradual transition from KNO scaling [32] to the LUND string model of PYTHIA [33] with increasing final state hadronic invariant mass, W . In genie, parameters that control the rate of strange particle production in hadronization are tuned such that rates of \u039b and K 0 S production on deuterium and neon agree with bubble chamber measurements [34][35][36][37][38][39]. Final state interactions, in which hadrons interact within the target nucleus, are modeled using the INTRANUKE package [14]. genie does not simulate FSI processes where K + are produced in \u03c0 + interactions, for example \u03c0 + n \u2192 K + \u039b. However, \u03c0 + strong interactions can only produce pairs of strage particles, and \u039b or \u03a3 baryons will cause events to be rejected.",
