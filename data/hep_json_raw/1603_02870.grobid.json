The decay proceeds at leading order via a b \u2192 sss loop transition and is therefore sensitive to the possible presence of particles beyond the Standard Model. A first observation is reported with a significance of 5.9 standard deviations. The value of the branching fraction is measured to be (5.18 \u00b1 1.04 \u00b1 0.35 +0.67   \u22120.62 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is related to external inputs. Triple-product asymmetries are measured to be consistent with zero.",

A Feynman diagram of the gluonic penguin that contributes to this decay at leading order is displayed in Fig. 1. This transition has been the subject of theoretical and experimental interest in B 0 s and B 0 decays, since possible beyond the SM particles in the loop could induce non-SM CP violation [1][2][3]. The process has been probed with decay-time-dependent methods in the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 decay modes [4][5][6][7], which test for CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay. In addition, measurements of CP violation in the decay have been performed with the flavourspecific B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03c6 channel [8]. The results to date are consistent with CP conservation in the b \u2192 sss process. Model-independently, non-SM physics contributions could appear differently in these decay modes, though many models contain strong correlations [9].",

            "text": "Measurements with \u039b 0 b baryons offer the possibility to look for CP violation in the decay, both by studying CP asymmetries and by means of T -odd observables. These observables have been studied in greater detail for B 0 s and B 0 meson decays than those for \u039b 0 b baryons [4,8,10,11]. Proposed methods to study T -odd asymmetries of \u039b 0 b baryons [12] exploit the polarisation structure of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039bV decays, where V denotes a vector resonance [12], and can be affected by the initial \u039b 0 b polarisation if non-zero. An LHCb measurement of the initial polarisation in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/ \u03c8\u039b decays has yielded a value consistent with zero, though polarisation at the level of 10% is possible given statistical uncertainties [13]. No SM prediction exists specifically for the T -odd asymmetries in \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03c6 decays, though no large asymmetries are expected given the prediction of CP conservation in the decays of beauty mesons for the same transition. Measurements of CP asymmetries have been performed by LHCb in an inclusive analysis of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039bhh decays [14], where h(h ) refers to a kaon or pion, with corresponding CP asymmetries measured to be consistent with zero.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.5 GeV. In the subsequent software trigger, at least one charged particle must have a transverse momentum",

The B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 non-resonant component has been observed by the BaBar[28], Belle[6] and LHCb[29]  Collaborations. This is separated from the signal decay through the different K + K \u2212 invariant mass line shapes. No significant partially reconstructed background, in which one or more of the final state particles are missed, is found in the B 0 mass region. Peaking backgrounds, from decays in which at least one of the final state particles has been misidentified, are suppressed by the narrow K + K \u2212 mass window around the \u03c6 meson and are treated as systematic uncertainties.The B 0 signal is modelled with the same modified Gaussian function as used in Ref.[30]. The modified Gaussian gives extra degrees of freedom to accommodate extended tails far from the mean. The \u03c6 signal is modelled with a relativistic Breit-Wigner shape [31] convolved with a Gaussian resolution function. The K 0 S signal is parametrised by the sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean. Decays from real B 0 mesons to the K 0 S K + K \u2212 final state in which the K + K \u2212 pair is non-resonant are described by the same B 0 and K 0 S line shapes as the signal, but with a phase-space factor to describe the non-resonant kaon pairs. The phase-space factor is given by the expression (m 2 \u2212(2m K ) 2 )/m 2 , where m is the K + K \u2212 invariant mass and m K is fixed to the value of the charged kaon mass. The use of a Flatt\u00e9 function [32] rather than a phasespace factor to describe a possible scalar component under the \u03c6 resonance is found to have a negligible effect on the results and is therefore not included. The combinatorial background is modelled by exponential functions in all three mass dimensions.A simultaneous fit to the long and downstream datasets is performed. The B 0 resolution, modified Gaussian tail parameters and resolutions and fractions of the K 0 S Gaussian functions are constrained to values obtained from a fit to simulated data, performed separately for long and downstream datasets. The total yield and fraction in the downstream dataset are left as free parameters for each component.The fit to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03c6 channel uses the same fit model as the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 control channel: a modified Gaussian function is used to describe the \u039b 0 b mass shape, a double Gaussian model to describe the \u039b shape, and a relativistic Breit-Wigner convolved with a Gaussian resolution function to describe that of the \u03c6 resonance. Due to the relatively unexplored mass spectra present in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03c6 decay, the background contributions have been identified using the data sidebands. In the final fit, four components are present. These are the signal \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u03c6 component, the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039bK + K \u2212 non-resonant component in which the K + K \u2212 dimension is described using the phase-space factor defined previously, combinatorial components with true \u03c6 or \u039b resonances, and a component that has a combinatorial origin in all three mass dimensions. Combinatorial backgrounds are modelled by exponential functions in each fit dimension. As for the case of the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 fit, the total yield and fraction in the downstream dataset are left as free parameters for each component. In addition, the same parameters are constrained to simulated data as in the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 fit.",

In addition to the track reconstruction efficiency, the vertexing efficiency of longlived particles contains disagreement between data and simulation.

In order to determine the systematic uncertainties, 1000 pseudoexperiments are generated with the alternative model and are subsequently fitted with the nominal model. The average difference between the generated and fitted yield values is taken as the systematic uncertainty. This leads to uncertainties of 3.0% and 0.6% for the signal and control mode yields, respectively.Systematic uncertainties associated with the efficiency corrections from simulated datasets are considered. The limited size of the simulated sample gives rise to an uncertainty of 2.2%. The main uncertainties in the tracking and vertexing correction factors arise from the limited size of the control sample, which leads to uncertainties of 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively. For the case of the trigger efficiency, uncertainties related to the software trigger cancel between the signal and control modes, as the software trigger decision is made only on the decay products of the \u03c6 meson.
