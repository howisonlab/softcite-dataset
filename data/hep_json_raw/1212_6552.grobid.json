These bottomonium bound states have a rich spectrum whose masses and transition amplitudes shed valuable light on the strong interactions. The present article reviews some recent developments in bottomonium physics. These include the discovery of the spin-singlet states \u03b7 b (1S, 2S) and h b (1P, 2P), the first D-wave states, one or more candidates for spin-triplet \u03c7 bJ (3P) excitations, and above-threshold states with strong transitions to states below threshold. Information on transitions, production, and signatures of new physics is also presented.",

It is most likely that this receives little contribution from the \u03c7 b0 (3P), whose partial width to hadronic states is expected to be considerably larger than that of the other two states (29), so it is probably to be compared with some weighted combination of the predicted masses of \u03c7 b1 (3P) and \u03c7 b2 (3P).",

Their participation in the intermediate state of the transitions from the \u03a5(5S) which produce h b (1P, 2P) as strongly as \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) follows naturally from a careful accounting of the ratio of bb triplet and singlet in their wave functions.

The properties of these states are summarized in Table 1. Both have isospin I = 1, positive G-parity, and are determined to have spin-parity J P = 1 + by angular analysis of their production and decay kinematics.

Pioneering work in this area (5, 6, 7) has been extended to include the effects of relativistic corrections (see, e.g., (58)) and the effects of coupling to open channels (see, e.g., many references in (17)). Potential model predictions for the masses of the 1D and 3P levels had a narrow range of ten or twenty MeV and were verified within that range. For the lowest-lying levels, lattice gauge theories (extended to include the effects of light-quark pairs) have also provided an effective description (see, e.g., (59)). One prediction of spin-dependent effects, shared in many approaches, also had great success. This is the small value of the hyperfine splitting in 1P and 2P bb states, as confirmed by the h b (1P) and h b (2P) masses (51). This may be traced to the vanishing of the P-wave wave function at the origin. The hyperfine splitting in nS states posed more of a problem for potential models, with a wide range of predictions (34). Recent estimates of M [\u03a5(1S)] \u2212 M [\u03b7 b (1S)] based on lattice gauge theory (36, 37) have been fairly close to the observed values.

Two-pion transitions were the only hadronic transitions known in the system until the obser-vation by the CLEO Collaboration of an unexpectedly large rate for the transition \u03c7 b1,2 (2P)) \u2192 \u03c9\u03a5(1S) published in 2004(78). Since then, updated measurements of the previously known dipion transitions have been made(79,80,81,82), and, additionally, a wide array of new transitions have been investigated by CLEO, Belle and BaBar : \u03c7 bJ (2P) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c7 bJ (1P) (83, 81), \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b7\u03a5(1S) (84, 82, 85), and both \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b7 transitions from states above the open beauty threshold, \u03a5(4S, 5S) to states below threshold (\u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S)) (86, 87, 41). Measurement of the relative rates for various hadronic transitions, together with invariant mass and angular distributions, particularly for those transitions mediated by different terms in the multipole expansion, can be particularly enlightening for our understanding of hadronization. The past decade has seen substantial advances in the study of hadronic transitions in the bottomonium spectrum as the following discussion shows. 3.6.1 Progress In \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03a5(mS) Among the more interesting questions concerning dipion transitions between \u03a5(nS) states below open beauty threshold arose from the stark contrast between the invariant mass distributions of the pion pair for the transition \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03a5(1S) as compared to that for \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03a5(1S). The \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass distribution in the latter transition agrees well with that from the analogous transition \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8, while the former transition has a double-humped invariant mass structure. While the 2S \u2192 1S transitions can be explained by a fairly simple matrix element, the \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03a5(1S) distribution cannot.",

The resulting nearly background-free analysis revealed branching fractions of (1.63 +0.10 )% for the \u03c7 b1 (2P) and \u03c7 b2 (2P) transitions, respectively.The \u03c7 bJ (2P) \u2192 \u03c9\u03a5(1S) process is expected to proceed via the emission of three E1 gluons(89), since the quantum numbers of the \u03c9 are that of the photon, J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 and the ratio of rates for the \u03c7 b2 (2P) transition to that for the \u03c7 b1 (2P) transition is expected to be 1.3 \u00b1 0.3. The measured branching fractions for the \u03c9 transitions from CLEO yield a ratio of rates between 0.9 and 1.5, in agreement with this prediction.3.6.3 \u03c7 bJ (2P) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c7 bJ (1P) Dipion transitions are expected to be the dominant transitions between radially excited heavy quarkonium states and their lower-mass partners, as they appear in the lowest possible order in the multipole expansion (77). Transitions from the \u03c7 bJ (2P) and \u03c7 bJ (1P) states of the same J (and in fact the states \u03b7 b (2S) and \u03b7 b (1S)) have been long expected, and in 2006, CLEO published the first observation of \u03c7 bJ (2P) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c7 bJ (1P) transitions. The CLEO analysis (83) utilized the involved a full reconstruction of the decay chain \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ (2P); \u03c7 bJ (2P) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c7 bJ (1P); \u03c7 bJ (1P) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5(1S); \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and again used the full CLEO \u03a5(3S) data set. The results from both \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 analyses were combined, and branching fractions of (6.0 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b1 1.4)% and (8.6 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b1 2.1)%, for J = 2 and J = 1, respectively (63). A study by BaBar published in 2011 (81), using a much larger sample of \u03a5(3S) decays, obtained precise measurements of the branching fractions: B(\u03c7 b1 (2P) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c7 b1 (1P)) = (9.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.9)% and B(\u03c7 b2 (2P) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c7 b2 (1P)) = (4.9 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.6)%. 3.6.4 \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b7\u03a5(1S) and search for related transitions The decay \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 was one of the first hadronic transitions observed in charmonium, with a branching fraction of B[\u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8] = (3.28 \u00b1 0.07)%(63), which is quite large given the tiny available phase space. By contrast, until a few years ago, only an upper limit was known for the corresponding bottomonium process: B[\u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b7\u03a5(1S)] < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (90). The production of a pseudoscalar meson in hadronic transitions between two 3 S 1 states involves the flip of a heavy quark spin (77, 91, 92). Such transitions in bottomonium thus can probe the chromomagnetic moment of the b quark. Their rates are expected to scale as \u0393 \u221d (p * ) 3 /m 4 Q , where m Q is the mass of the heavy quark Q = c, b. Then one predicts \u0393[\u03a5(2S, 3S) \u2192 \u03b7\u03a5(1S)] \u0393[\u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8] = (0.0025, 0.0013) ,",

Their dominant decays are to those open-bottom mesons whose pair-production threshold lies lower in mass. The large \u03a5(4S, 5S) data samples accumulated by BaBar and Belle make possible, despite their small expected branching fractions, the observation of hadronic and radiative transitions from \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) -and their observation yields additional interesting and important information concerning the nature of the bottomonium system. Both BaBar and Belle have studied the transitions \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S, 2S) using their large \u03a5(4S) data samples, exclusively reconstructing the full transi-tion, with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 observed in conjunction with the leptonic decay \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 = (e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) of the daughter \u03a5(nS) state. The partial widths for \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S, 2S) thus obtained are similar to the partial widths for \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S, 2S) (86, 87). This is what one would have na\u00efvely expected, though the BaBar analysis made an important observation concerning the invariant mass of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs emitted in the \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(2S) transition. That is, the distribution of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass in this transition bears a striking resemblance to that of the \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S) transition. Interestingly, both are \u2206n = 2 transitions, while the \u2206n = 3 transitions resemble more closely their \u2206n = 1 counterparts. By contrast, the transitions \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S) observed by the Belle Collaboration showed significant discrepancies with respect to theoretical expectations. In a sample of 21.7 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 collisions at an energy corresponding to M (\u03a5(5S)), Belle observed very large rates for the transitions \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S, 2S, 3S): up to 100 times larger than the corresponding rates for\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transitions among sub-threshold \u03a5(nS) states(41). This was so far above the expectations of similar rates that immediately speculation ensued concerning the possible existence of tetraquark or other exotic non-\u03a5(nS) states near \u03a5(5S) (93).",

A detailed understanding of this process is therefore an important test of our understanding of QCD. A number of different approaches have been proposed to factorize the highmomentum (short-distance) scale process leading to a QQ pair (predominantly by gluon-gluon fusion diagrams) and the low-momentum (long-distance) scale of the process that binds the QQ into color singlet quarkonia of the given quantum numbers: the color singlet model (CSM) (94, 95, 96), NRQCD factorization (97), fragmentation function factorization (98), and k T factorization (99, 100).The mutual relations and differences among these approaches are discussed in detail in(17). One of the open issues regards the contribution of QQ pairs that are in color singlet (CS) as compared to those in which the QQ pairs are in a color octet (CO). In the QCD-based CSM only the former is considered, while in the NRQCD, k t and fragmentation approaches both singlet and octet contributions exist.The parameters relevant for the calculation of the color singlet contribution can be extracted from measurements of quarkonium decays using potential models or lattice calculations, so the inclusive differential cross section has no additional free parameters. It is not possible at present to relate the parameters of the color-octet contribution to quantities measured in quarkonium decays, and they are usually determined from fits to differential cross sections.",

            "text": "However the cross sections for bottomonia are much smaller, and until the advent of the LHC, most of the measurements of heavy quarkonium hadroproduction involved J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S). Also, experimentally it is more difficult to determine the \u03a5(nS) that are directly produced subtracting the contribution originating from the decays of higher resonances, since the spectrum below the open-flavor threshold is much richer compared to that of charmonium.4.1 Differential cross sections for \u03a5(nS) vs. theoryOne of the key features of the differential cross section for direct \u03a5(nS) production is its p t dependence. At leading order the color singlet contribution has a p \u22128 t dependence, while the color octet contribution has a p \u2212dependence due to gluon fragmentation. However at NLO the color singlet contribution has large corrections proportional to p \u22126 t , and a small correction proportional to p \u22124 t due to quark fragmentation. The NNLO corrections have been only partially calculated, but the gluon fragmentation provides large corrections proportional to p \u22124 t . No significant rapidity (y) dependence is expected in the central region. In the high p t limit the shapes of the differential cross sections are predicted to be the same for all the \u03a5(nS). For the color singlet contribution the ratios of the \u03a5(nS)/\u03a5(1S) cross sections are simply related to the ratios of wavefunctions at the origin. The CDF experiment measured the inclusive differential cross section, as a function of p t , for \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) production in pp collisions at \u221a s TeV in the rapidity interval |y| < 0.4 (101). The D0 experiment measured the inclusive differential cross sections for \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) in a broader interval, |y| < 1.8 (102). The \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and \u03a5(3S) differential cross sections have been measured at LHC in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The CMS experiment has measured the differential cross sections as a function of p t for p t < 30 GeV/c 2 in the rapidity range |y| < 2 (103). They find that the p t dependence of the three cross sections is in excellent agreement with the Tevatron measurements despite the substantial differences in collision energy and y interval. The LHCb experiment, whose detectors cover the forward rapidity region, has presented measurements of the double differential cross section as a function of p t and y for p t < 15 GeV/c 2 and 2.0 < y < 4.5 (104). Finally, the ATLAS experiment has recently extended the measurement of these cross sections up to p t < 70 GeV/c 2 in the rapidity range |y| < 2.25 based on an integrated luminosity of 1.8 fb \u22121 (105). The measured cross sections are in agreement with the measurements from CMS and LHCb, in the rapidity ranges covered by both experiments. The measured cross sections are qualitatively in agreement with the various predictions, but ultimately no prediction is able to describe cross sections accurately in all p t ranges. The comparison is made more difficult by the uncertainties in the \u03a5(nS) polarization, which result in uncertainties in acceptance corrections, and by the uncertainties in the contribution to the inclusive differential cross sections from decays of higher resonances. The ratios of the \u03a5(2S, 3S) to \u03a5(1S) cross sections as a function of p t have been measured by CMS (103) and ATLAS (105). Both experiments observe an increase for both ratios up to p t \u2248 30 GeV/c 2 . At larger p t , so far measured only by ATLAS, the cross section ratios seem to reach a saturation. At large p t the direct production is expected to dominate over indirect contributions from decays of higher resonances, and ATLAS observes that the values of the plateau are somewhat large, but compatible, with the values of the ratios of the wavefunction at the origin as expected for the color singlet contribution.",

Heavy quarkonia, however, also may be used to search for hints of new physics. We describe in this section some recent new-physics searches in studies of bottomonium decays. 5.1 Decays of \u03a5(1S) \u2192 invisible via \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Decays of \u03a5(nS) states to final states that are not observable by typical multipurpose detectors offer an excellent place to search for the impact of physics beyond the standard model, chiefly because the only allowed \"invisible\" decays of \u03a5(nS) within the standard model are the decays \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, whose branching fractions can be fairly tightly constrained by the well-measured leptonic decays of \u03a5(nS). The SM prediction for B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 invisible), based on the present measurement of the leptonic decay rate of \u03a5(1S), is \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (114). If the rate of invisible decays of \u03a5(nS) is observed to be substantially larger than the predicted rate, the presence of additional new mediating bosons, which would increase the expected \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd rate, could be the cause. Another potential explanation would involve the decay of \u03a5(nS) to pairs of dark matter candidate particles -such an enhancement could increase the invisible branching fraction up to near 10 \u22123 (115).

While lepton flavor violation is now well established in the neutrino sector due to oscillations between neutrino flavors, it is generally agreed that lepton flavor violation in the charged sector (CLFV) is so highly suppressed that its observation at any level is an unambiguous sign of new physics. A number of efforts to observe CLFV have been made in B and K decays, or in decays of leptons themselves -but the study of charged lepton flavor violating decays of \u03a5(nS) has only recently been explored in any detail.
