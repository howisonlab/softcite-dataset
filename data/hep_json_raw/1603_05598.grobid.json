Using a large sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays from 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collision data, measurements of the reconstruction efficiency, as well as of the momentum scale and resolution, are presented and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The reconstruction efficiency is measured to be close to 99 % over most of the covered phase space (|\u03b7| < 2.5 and 5 < p T < 100 GeV). The isolation efficiency varies between 93 and 100 % depending on the selection applied and on the momentum of the muon. Both efficiencies are well reproduced in simulation. In the central region of the detector, the momentum resolution is measured to be 1.7 % (2.3 %) for muons from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc (Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) decays, and the momentum scale is known with an uncertainty of 0.05 %. In the region |\u03b7| > 2.2, the p T resolution for muons from Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays is 2.9 % while the precision of the momentum scale for lowp T muons from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays is about 0.2 %.",

This type has the lowest purity of all the muon types but it recovers acceptance in the region where the ATLAS muon spectrometer is only partially instrumented to allow for cabling and services to the calorimeters and inner detector. The identification criteria for CT muons are optimised for that region (|\u03b7| < 0.1) and a momentum range of 15 < p T < 100 GeV. \u2022 Extrapolated (ME) muons: the muon trajectory is reconstructed based only on the MS track and a loose requirement on compatibility with originating from the IP. The parameters of the muon track are defined at the interaction point, taking into account the estimated energy loss of the muon in the calorimeters. In general, the muon is required to traverse at least two layers of MS chambers to provide a track measurement, but three layers are required in the forward region. ME muons are mainly used to extend the acceptance for muon reconstruction into the region 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.7, which is not covered by the ID.",

The calculation of the energy loss in the calorimeter was also improved. An analytic parameterization of the average energy loss is derived from a detailed description of the detector geometry. The final estimate of the energy loss is obtained by combining the analytic parameterization with the energy measured in the calorimeter.

Loose, Medium, and Tight are inclusive categories in that muons identified with tighter requirements are also included in the looser categories. Medium muons The Medium identification criteria provide the default selection for muons in ATLAS. This selection minimises the systematic uncertainties associated with muon reconstruction and calibration. Only CB and ME tracks are used. The former are required to have \u22653 hits in at least two MDT layers, except for tracks in the |\u03b7| < 0.1 region, where tracks with at least one MDT layer but no more than one MDT hole layer are allowed. The latter are required to have at least three MDT/CSC layers, and are employed only in the 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.7 region to extend the acceptance outside the ID geometrical coverage. A loose selection on the compatibility between ID and MS momentum measurements is applied to suppress the contamination due to hadrons misidentified as muons. Specifically, the q/p significance is required to be less than seven. In the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5, about 0.5 % of the muons classified as Medium originate from the inside-out combined reconstruction strategy. Loose muons The Loose identification criteria are designed to maximise the reconstruction efficiency while providing good-quality muon tracks. They are specifically optimised for reconstructing Higgs boson candidates in the four-lepton final state [5]. All muon types are used. All CB and ME muons satisfying the Medium requirements are included in the Loose selection. CT and ST muons are restricted to the |\u03b7| < 0.1 region. In the region |\u03b7| < 2.5, about 97.5 % of the Loose muons are combined muons, approximately 1.5 % are CT, and the remaining 1 % are reconstructed as ST muons. Tight muons Tight muons are selected to maximise the purity of muons at the cost of some efficiency. Only CB muons with hits in at least two stations of the MS and satisfying the Medium selection criteria are considered. The normalised \u03c7 2 of the combined track fit is required to be <8 to remove pathological tracks. A two-dimensional cut in the \u03c1 and q/p significance variables is performed as a function of the muon The reconstruction efficiencies for signal and background obtained from tt simulation are reported in Table 1. The results are shown for the four identification selection criteria separating low (4 < p T < 20 GeV) and high (20 < p T < 100 GeV) transverse momentum muon candidates. No isolation requirement is applied in the selection shown in the table. When isolation requirements are applied, the misidentification rates are reduced by more than an order of magnitude. It should be noted that the higher misidentification rate observed for Loose with respect to Medium muons is mainly due to CT muons in the region |\u03b7| < 0.1.",

The probe muon is required to have a transverse momentum of at least 10 GeV and to satisfy the Loose isolation criteria. While this is sufficient to ensure high purity in the case of MS probe tracks, further requirements are applied to both the ID track and CT muon probes. In the case of ID tracks, an isolation requirement is applied which is considerably stricter than the Loose selection in order to suppress backgrounds as much as possible. In addition, the invariant mass window is tightened to 5 GeV around the Z boson mass, rather than the 10 GeV used in the other cases. For CT muon probes, additional requirements on the compatibility of the associated calorimeter energy deposit with a muon signature are applied to further enhance the purity. The ID probe tracks and calorimeter-tagged probe muons must also have transverse and longitudinal impact parameters consistent with being produced in a primary pp interaction, as required for tag muons. A probe is considered successfully reconstructed if a reconstructed muon is found within a cone in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane of size R = 0.05 around the probe track.",

The systematic uncertainties in the SFs are estimated by varying the background contributions within their uncertainties and by varying some of the selection criteria, such as the invariant mass selection window, the isolation of the tag muon, the minimum quality of the probe muon, the opening angle between the two muons, and the R between the probe muon and the closest jet. In Fig. 8, the largest systematic uncertainty contribution over the entire p T region arises from having neglected the \u03b7 dependence of the SFs, which are usually provided as a function of \u03b7 and p T . In the lowp T region, other important contributions are due to the background estimation and the mass window variation, while the highp T region is dominated by statistical uncertainties in data and simulation. The total uncertainty is at the per mille level over a wide range of p T and reaches the percent level in the highp T region. The suppression factor for muons from light mesons or b/c semileptonic decays is estimated from simulation and depends on the isolation working point, ranging from a minimum of 15 for LooseTrackOnly to a maximum of 40 for Gradient.",

In J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays, the intrinsic width of the resonance is negligible with respect to the experimental resolution. The bulk of the peak is modelled by a Crystal Ball function; a Gaussian distribution centred on the Crystal Ball function is added to the signal description to model the tails of the distribution. The non-resonant background is described by an exponential function. In Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays, the fits use a convolution of the true lineshape (modelled by a Breit-Wigner function) with an experimental resolution function (a combination of a Crystal Ball and a Gaussian function). Similarly to the J/\u03c8, the non-resonant background is described by an exponential function. The peak position and width of the Crystal Ball function are used as estimators for the m \u03bc\u03bc and \u03c3 (m \u03bc\u03bc ) variables in the various \u03b7 and p T bins. Figure 10 shows the position of the peak of the invariant mass distribution, m \u03bc\u03bc , obtained from the fits to the Z boson and J/\u03c8 samples as a function of the pseudorapidity of the highestp T muon for CB pairs. The distributions are shown for data as well as corrected simulation, with the ratio of the two in the lower panel. The simulation is in very good agreement with the data. Minor deviations are contained within the scale systematic uncertainties of 0.05 % in the barrel region, increasing with |\u03b7| to 0.1 %(0.3 %) in the region |\u03b7| \u223c 2.5 for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc (J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) decays. The systematic uncertainties shown in the plots include the effects of the uncertainties in the calibration constants described in Sect. 8.1 and the changes in the fit parameterization. The observed level of agreement demonstrates that the p T calibration for combined muon tracks described above provides a very accurate description of the momentum scale in all \u03b7 regions, over a wide p T range. Similar levels of data/MC agreement are observed for the ID and MS components of the combined tracks. Figure 11 displays the dimuon mass resolution \u03c3 (m \u03bc\u03bc ) as a function of the leading-muon \u03b7 for the two resonances. The dimuon mass resolution is about 1.2 and 1.6 % at small \u03b7 values for J/\u03c8 and Z bosons, respectively, and increases to 1.6 and 1.9 % in the endcaps. This corresponds to a relative muon p T resolution of 1.7 and 2.3 % in the centre of the detector and 2.3 and 2.9 % in the endcaps for J/\u03c8 and Z boson decays, respectively. After applying the momentum corrections described above, the simulation reproduces the resolution measured in data, well within the systematic  uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are estimated following the same procedure described for the determination of the energy scale. Good agreement between the dimuon mass resolution measured in data and simulation is also observed for the ID and MS components of the combined tracks.",
