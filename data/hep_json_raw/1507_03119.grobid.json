The data, collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . Selected events contain an electron or a muon and four or more jets, where at least one jet is identified as originating from b-quark hadronization. The inclusive charge asymmetry is found to be 0.0010 \u00b10.0068 (stat)\u00b1 0.0037 (syst). In addition, differential charge asymmetries as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum, and invariant mass of the tt system are studied. For the first time at the LHC, the measurements are also performed in a reduced fiducial phase space of top quark pair production, with an integrated result of \u22120.0035 \u00b1 0.0072 (stat) \u00b1 0.0031 (syst). All measurements are consistent within two standard deviations with zero asymmetry as well as with the predictions of the standard model.",

A possible hint for new physics in the top quark sector is the discrepancy between the measured tt forwardbackward asymmetry and the SM expectations, reported by the CDF [1,2] and D0 [3][4][5] Collaborations at the Tevatron. Although this discrepancy has become smaller as the measurements and SM calculations [6,7] have been refined, it has generated a number of theoretical explanations invoking contributions from physics beyond the SM (BSM). These have in turn led to models based on axigluons or Z bosons as mediators in the tt production process. An overview of the theoretical explanations can be found in Ref. [8] and references therein.",

At leading order (LO), the tt production is symmetric with respect to the exchange of the top quark and antiquark. At higher orders, QCD radiative corrections to the qq \u2192 tt process induce an asymmetry in the differential distributions of top quarks and antiquarks. The interference between initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) processes, as well as the interference between the Born and box diagrams, generate a correlation between the E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. direction of the top quark momentum and that of the incoming quark [9]. Similarly, the direction of the top antiquark momentum is related to that of the incoming antiquark. These processes induce a forward-backward asymmetry (A FB ) at the Tevatron pp collider. The charge-symmetric pp collisions at the CERN LHC result in a different effect. At the LHC, the larger average momentum fraction of the valence quarks leads to an excess of top quarks produced in the forward and backward directions, while the top antiquarks are produced more centrally. This makes the difference in the absolute values of the rapidities 1 of the top quark and antiquark, |y| = |y t | \u2212 |y\u00aft|, a suitable observable to measure the tt charge asymmetry at the LHC experiments.

For an event to be accepted, the primary vertex must satisfy criteria on its location within the detector volume, as well as on the quality of its reconstruction. Jets are clustered from PF particles with the anti-k T [32] algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.5. Charged hadrons identified as originating from pileup vertices are removed before clustering into jets. Further corrections [33] to the jet energy are applied, depending on jet \u03b7 and p T , the jet area in \u03b7-\u03c6 space, and the median p T density of the event. The selected jets must lie within |\u03b7| < 2.5 and are required to have p T > 30 GeV. The jet p T resolution in data is approximately 10% worse compared to simulations. To account for this, the transverse momenta of jets in the simulated samples are smeared accordingly. Finally, jets from the hadronization of b quarks are identified using the medium working point of the combined secondary vertex algorithm [34]. The b tag identification efficiency of this algorithm for b jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 varies between 60 and 70%, while the misidentification rate for jets arising from light quarks or gluons is about 1% [35].",

The selection efficiencies relative to the full phase space for the inclusive measurement and for the differential measurement in m tt are depicted in Fig. 2. The selection efficiency of the fiducial phase space is defined by the ratio of all selected events to the events present in the fiducial phase space. It should be noted that the selected events also include events that do not pass the criteria of the fiducial phase space; their influence is implicitly corrected for in the acceptance correction because of the way the selection efficiency is defined. Thus this correction is multiplicative in nature, which is justified by the inherent similarity of these events to the events that are intended to be measured. One limiting factor for the precision of the analysis is the presence of sizeable statistical fluctuations in the response matrices as they are obtained from simulated events. To mitigate this effect, one can exploit an approximate symmetry of the response matrix under charge conjugation. For events resulting from a charge-symmetric initial state like gluon-gluon fusion it can be assumed that reconstruction effects also have a predominantly charge-symmetric behaviour. From this reasoning, the symmetry is enforced for this analysis by averaging those bins of the gluongluon contribution to the response matrix that correspond to each other under charge conjugation.",

The uncertainty in the theoretical prediction by K\u00fchn and Rodrigo [10] is estimated by varying the top quark mass, the PDFs, and the \u03bc R and \u03bc F scales, with the scale uncertainties being the dominant effect. The uncertainty in the theoretical prediction by Bernreuther and Si [11,49] contains only the effects of variations of the \u03bc R and \u03bc F scales. The tt charge asymmetry for the fiducial phase space is computed with the tt production and semileptonic/non-leptonic tt decay matrix elements at NLO. The top quark decay matrix elements at NLO contain additional scale dependencies. This results in a larger scale uncertainty as compared to the charge asymmetry for the full phase space. Another recent CMS analysis of the inclusive charge asymmetry in the full phase space [50], which uses a slightly more model-dependent ap- proach to achieve lower uncertainties, and a recently published ATLAS measurement of inclusive and differential charge asymmetries [51] both yield results that are comparable to the ones presented here.",

The latter is capable of reproducing the CDF results [2] by introducing an anomalous effective axial-vector coupling to the gluon at the one-loop level. The gluon-quark vertex is treated in the approximation of an effective field theory with a scale for new physics contributions of order 1.5-2.0 TeV. Predictions for the asymmetry as a function of p tt T are not available for this theory and for one of the SM calculations. Because of the importance of the region of high m tt for the detection of new physics, we provide an additional, more finelygrained differential measurement of the asymmetry as a function of this observable.",

The observed distributions are then corrected for acceptance and reconstruction effects. For the first time at the LHC, acceptance corrections to the tt charge asymmetry are performed not only to the full phase space but also to a fiducial phase space. Within two standard deviations, all measured values are consistent with the predictions of the standard model and no hint of new physics contributions is observed. The charge asymmetry in the high-mass region is about two standard deviations below the predictions from an effective field theory with the scale for new physics at 1.5 TeV.

Furthermore, electron candidates are selected based on the value of a multivariate discriminant, which combines different variables related to calorimetry and tracking parameters, but also p T and \u03b7 of the electron candidate. In this definition, electrons must have p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5 and I rel < 0.15, while passing a loose criterion on the value of the multivariate discriminant. Muons are required to have p T > 10 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and I rel < 0.2.",
