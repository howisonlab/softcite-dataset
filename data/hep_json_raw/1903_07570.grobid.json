            "text": "A measurement of observables sensitive to spin correlations in tt production is presented, using 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Differential cross-sections are measured in events with exactly one electron and one muon with opposite-sign electric charge as a function of the azimuthal opening angle and the absolute difference in pseudorapidity between the electron and muon candidates in the laboratory frame. The azimuthal opening angle is also measured as a function of the invariant mass of the tt system. The measured differential cross-sections are compared to predictions by several NLO Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations. The observed degree of spin correlation is somewhat higher than predicted by the generators used. The data are consistent with the prediction of one of the fixed-order calculations at NLO, but agree less well with higher-order predictions. Using these leptonic observables, a search is performed for pair production of supersymmetric top squarks decaying into Standard Model top quarks and light neutralinos. Top squark masses between 170 and 230 GeV are largely excluded at the 95% confidence level for kinematically allowed values of the neutralino mass.",

            "text": "The lifetime of the top quark is shorter than the timescale for hadronisation (\u223c10 \u221223 s) and is much shorter than the spin decorrelation time (\u223c10 \u221221 s) [1]. As a result, the spin information of the top quark is transferred directly to its decay products. Top quark pair production (tt) in QCD is parity invariant and hence the top quarks are not expected to be polarised in the Standard Model (SM); however, the spins of the top and the anti-top quarks are predicted to be correlated. This correlation has been observed experimentally by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in proton-proton collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV [2-5] and \u221a s = 8 TeV [6][7][8][9]. It has been also studied in protonantiproton collisions at the Tevatron collider [10][11][12][13][14]. This paper presents measurements of spin correlation at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV in proton-proton collisions using the ATLAS detector and data collected in 2015 and 2016.",

            "text": "Due to the unstable nature of top quarks, their spin information is accessed through their decay products. However, not all decay particles carry the spin information to the same degree, with charged leptons arising from leptonically decaying W bosons carrying almost the full spin information of the parent top quark [15][16][17][18]. This feature, along with the fact that charged leptons are readily identified and reconstructed by collider experiments, means that observables to study spin correlation in tt events are often based on the angular distributions of the charged leptons in events where both W bosons decay leptonically (referred to as the dilepton channel). The simplest observable is the absolute azimuthal opening angle between the two charged leptons [19], measured in the laboratory frame in the plane transverse to the beam line. This opening angle is denoted by \u03c6. Non-vanishing spin correlation was observed by the ATLAS experiment using the \u03c6 observable and \u221a s = 7 TeV data [2]. Since that time, spin correlation in tt pairs has been extensively studied by both ATLAS and CMS using many observables and techniques. Spin correlation measurements have also been used to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) either directly, by searching for decreases in the expected SM spin correlation induced by scalar supersymmetric top squarks (stops) [6], or indirectly by setting limits on effective field theory operators, such as the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric dipole operators [8]. Previous measurements by ATLAS [2,3,6] and CMS [5,8] using \u03c6 show slightly stronger spin correlation than expected in the SM, but with experimental uncertainties large enough that the results are still consistent with the SM expectation. In this paper, improved Monte Carlo (MC) generators are employed relative to previous spin correlation results from ATLAS to better control the systematic uncertainties. The spin correlation is measured as a function of the invariant mass of the tt system, as well as inclusively.",

Such a scenario is difficult to constrain with conventional searches; however, observables such as \u03c6 and the absolute difference between the pseudorapidities of the two charged leptons, \u03b7, are highly sensitive in this regard. The \u03c6 distribution was previously used in such a search by ATLAS [6] and this new paper also includes \u03b7 for this purpose. Although this observable is only mildly sensitive to the SM spin correlation, it is sensitive to different supersymmetry (SUSY) hypotheses; the two observables are therefore used together in this paper to set limits on SUSY top squark production.",

The data considered in this analysis were recorded under stable beam conditions and required all sub-detectors to be operational. Each selected event included additional interactions from, on average, 24 inelastic pp collisions in the same proton bunch crossing, as well as residual detector signals from previous and subsequent bunch crossings, collectively referred to as \"pile-up\". Events were required to pass either a single-electron or single-muon trigger. Multiple triggers were used to select events: the lowestthreshold triggers utilised isolation requirements to reduce the trigger rate, and had transverse momentum ( p T ) thresholds of 24 GeV for electrons and 20 GeV for muons in 2015 data, or 26 GeV for both lepton types in 2016 data. These triggers were complemented by others with higher p T thresholds and no isolation requirements to increase event acceptance.",

Additional pp interactions were generated with Pythia 8 (v8.186) [26] and overlaid onto signal and background processes in order to simulate the effect of pile-up. The simulated events were weighted to match the distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing that are observed in data.

This sample was used, along with the nominal sample, as a template in the extraction of spin correlation, described in Sect. 8. A further Powheg + Pythia 8 sample was generated with the spin correlations enabled in MadSpin, to allow a comparison of the simulation of Powheg + Pythia 8 with and without the use of MadSpin. In order to facilitate comparisons to predictions from fixed-order calculations or from other MC generators, the primary spin correlation coefficients as measured in the nominal Powheg-Box sample, using the formalism described in Ref.

The history of the stable particles in the generator-level record was used to identify fake leptons from these processes.

The reconstructed selection is used for the measurement of \u03c6 as a function of the tt invariant mass. It has a more stringent b-tagging requirement of at least two b-tagged jets and also requires that at least one solution was found for the reconstruction of the tt system (described in detail later in this section).

A less strict b-tagging selection requirement of only one or more b-tagged jets is used in the inclusive selection in order to increase the event selection efficiency. Only events with exactly one electron and one muon are considered as this decay mode provides the highest signal purity as well as more than sufficient data statistics.

To mitigate these effects, the assumed value of m t is scanned between the values of 171 and 174 GeV, in steps of 0.5 GeV, and the p T of the measured jets are smeared using a Gaussian function with a p T -dependent width between 14% and 8% of their measured p T . This smearing is repeated 5 times.",

The solution which produces the highest w gives the kinematics of the reconstructed event. Solutions which provide an invariant mass of the tt system below 300 GeV, or which provide t ort quarks with negative energies, are rejected. For around 5% of events, no solution can be found, even after smearing. Only events with at least for the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 inclusive selection. In all figures, the rightmost bin also contains events that are above the x-axis range. The dark uncertainty bands in the ratio plots represent the statistical uncertainties while the light uncertainty bands represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The systematic uncertainties include contributions from leptons, jets, miss-ing transverse momentum, background modelling, pile-up modelling and luminosity, but not PDF or signal tt modelling uncertainties. The observed distribution is compared to the sum of signal and background using three different tt signal models: Powheg +Pythia 8, Powheg +Herwig 7 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8, and the ratio panel compares the summed prediction to data for the three models one solution with a weight above 0.4 are considered, where this criterion was chosen to optimise the angular resolution in the top quark reconstruction. The efficiency for tt reconstruction is \u223c80%. Due to the implicit assumptions about m t and m W , the reconstruction efficiency found in simulated background samples is much lower (\u223c60% for t W and Drell-Yan processes) and leads to a suppression of background events. Table 1 shows the event yields before and after reconstruction in the signal region. The different effects of the system-atic uncertainties on each type of selection are discussed in greater detail in Sect. 7. and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8, and the ratio panel compares the summed prediction to data for the three models ased and stable unfolding procedure for the \u03c6 observable (described further in Sect. 5).",

Jet and pile-up effects are also significant, but only in the absolute cross-sections. Overall, reasonable agreement is observed in the inclusive cross-section between the data and MC predictions but significant shape effects are apparent, particularly in the normalised observables where the uncertainties are small. Ignoring the differences in the absolute fiducial cross-sections between different MC generators, the shapes predicted by different generators are fairly consistent, except perhaps at very high \u03b7. In the \u03c6 observable, an obvious trend is observed, with the data tending to be higher than the expectation at low \u03c6 and lower than the expectation at high \u03c6. For \u03b7, the data and expectation agree well at low values, even in the normalised cross-sections, but there is a slight tension at higher values. The unfolded, normalised parton-level cross-sections for \u03c6 in four tt invariant mass bins are shown in Table 4. They are compared with different NLO ME generators and parton showers in Fig. 8 and the systematic uncertainties are illustrated in Fig. 9. Each differential cross-section is normalised within its m tt range. In all regions of invariant mass, the systematic uncertainties arising from the modelling of the tt and jets are dominant, with statistical uncertainties on the data becoming more important at higher values of invariant mass. In the lowest region of invariant mass, the various NLO predictions differ from each other and from the data. In the other regions of m tt the differences are less pronounced and agree within the uncertainties.",

Previous measurements from ATLAS and CMS have also observed f SM > 1 but the uncertainties were such that the results were consistent with the prediction, even without template uncertainties included [2-9]. The central f SM value as a function of m tt is found to increase as a function of m tt ; however, the uncertainties on f SM are much larger than in the inclusive case and none of the results deviate substantially from the SM expectation. A number of cross-checks were performed to attempt to understand the results in terms of either the limitations of the modelling of the tt system or by experimental effects not covered by the systematic uncertainty prescription described above. The NLO generators used in this analysis model tt production at NLO in QCD (hereafter simply referred to as NLO) but do not fully include NLO effects in the decays of the top quarks, nor do they directly consider the effects of interference between the initial and final states. The production and decay of the top quarks are factorised using the narrow-width approximation (NWA). The MCFM generator [80] can provide fixed-order predictions for tt production and decay at full NLO in the dilepton channel under the NWA. The effect of the spin analysing power of the lepton itself also changes from unity at LO to 0.998 at NLO [16] and this is also not considered in the nominal hypothesis templates. Alternative hypothesis templates were generated using MCFM (using the same scale and PDF settings as the nominal Powheg + Pythia 8 sample), illustrated in Fig. 13, and the prediction is remarkably close to the prediction from Powheg + Pythia 8. It is concluded that the LO decays of the top quarks used in the nominal hypothesis templates have little effect on the measurement and do not explain the observed differences between data and predictions.",

Naturalness arguments suggest that SUSY models with light top squarks may provide a solution to the hierarchy problem; however, a light top squark with a mass nearly degenerate with that of the top quark (so called \"stealth stops\") are challenging to detect using direct searches. It has been shown that leptonic spectra, such as \u03b7, can differentiate betweent 1t1 and SM tt production [86] and in previous searches ATLAS exploited differences between the expected spin correlations in the \u03c6 observable to set lim-its ont 1t1 production at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV [6]. In this analysis the sensitivity of both of these observables is exploited simultaneously to maximise the sensitivity to stealth stop scenarios. Double-differential distributions of \u03c6 in ranges of \u03b7 of | \u03b7| < 1.5, 1.5 < | \u03b7| < 2.5, and 2.5 < | \u03b7| < 4.5 are constructed as this was found to provide the optimal sensitivity to a wide variety oft 1t1 scenarios, where the majority of the expected sensitivity comes from the | \u03b7| component.

Limits are determined using a profile likelihood ratio in the asymptotic limit, using nuisance parameters to account for sources of systematic uncertainties. The limits are extracted at the 95% confidence level (CL) using the CL s prescription [87]. The absolute cross-sections are used in the limits and the tt cross-section is set to its SM value (as described in Sect. 3) but allowed to vary as a nuisance parameter within the theoretical uncertainties. All experimental and modelling systematic uncertainties that are considered for the differential cross-section results and for the spin correlation measurement are also considered here as nuisance param-eters in the fit. In addition, these sources of experimental uncertainty are also considered on thet 1t1 samples. In contrast to the tt prediction, SUSY modelling uncertainties such as the choice of factorisation and renormalisation scales, the merging and matching scale, and the Pythia tune are found to produce a negligible contribution on the shape of the distributions. The limits are found to be insensitive to these systematic uncertainties, which are therefore neglected. Finally, an additional uncertainty is included to account for the spread of predictions observed in Fig. 13. The difference between the NLO background tt predictions from Powheg + Pythia 8 and the NLO QCD + Weak expanded predictions is taken, symmetrised, as a theoretical model uncertainty in order to  account for the differences observed in the data compared to the prediction as discussed in Sect. 8. This encompasses the range of current NLO predictions of the tt background process, particularly for the \u03c6 observable. The fit was found to be very sensitive to correlations between the additional radiation and MC generator uncertainties, therefore these uncertainties were split into individual nuisance parameters per bin to break the correlations. The largest sources of systematic uncertainty on the limits are the tt cross-section uncertainty, the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of radiation settings and MC generator in the tt simulation, and the theoretical model uncertainty on the tt background. Without this final systematic uncertainty, the observed limits would become stronger due to the poorer description of the background compared to the data and the difference between the expected and observed limits would also become stronger. The limits are also found to be stable when the tt prediction is reweighted to match the NLO QCD + Weak expanded prediction. SUSY production for a given mt 1 , m\u03c70",

In the presence of two-body top squark decays, the top production cross-section used in the fit would be too high, resulting in more stringent limits being set on top squarks near and above the top quark mass. The limits would be most affected for mt 1 = m t and the effect would disappear with increasing top squark mass. Equivalently, three-body top squark decays would affect limits near and below the top quark mass; however, as this analysis does not consider masses below mt 1 = 170 GeV this effect is small. The magnitude of the expected bias on the top quark mass and the top quark pair production cross-section due to two-body top squark decays is estimated in Refs. [89,90]. For m\u03c70 1 = 1 GeV, the maximum bias is approximately m t = 2.0 (0.4) GeV for mt 1 = 170 (200) GeV, resulting in a cross-section shift of 5.3% (1.1%). In addition, for m\u03c70 1 = 20 GeV, the maximum bias is approximately m t = 1.5 (0.5) GeV, resulting in a cross-section shift of 3.9% (1.3%). The fits are performed again assuming these biases, interpolated for the region of 170 \u2264 mt 1 \u2264 200 GeV and m\u03c70 1 \u2264 20 GeV. This results in an increase in the observed top squark cross-section limit at mt 1 = 170 GeV of 8 pb, and an extension of the 1\u03c3 error band in Fig. 17 by 10 GeV towards lower values of mt 1 . However, neither the expected nor the observed upper limits set by the analysis are altered. Some of the excluded phase-space has already been excluded by existing direct measurements, however, these results are more stringent than the existing limits [91] in a kinematically challenging region (where mt \u223c m t ) not currently excluded by direct searches [92,93].
