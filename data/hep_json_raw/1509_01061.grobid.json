Within uncertainties, all measurements agree, supporting the hypothesis that fragmentation is independent of the specific production process. Averages of the fragmentation fractions over all measurements are presented. The average has significantly reduced uncertainties compared to individual measurements.",

Therefore, these measurements are a necessary ingredient for any QCD prediction of charm-hadron production. In this context, it is important to validate the hypothesis that fragmentation fractions are universal, i.e. independent of the hard production mechanism. Thus, once precisely measured in one experiment, they can be applied in any reaction. Another important check is that the sum of fragmentation fractions of all known weakly decaying charm hadrons is equal to unity, thus checking if all weakly decaying states are known.",

Due to independent data sets and different detector types and constructions, the experimental statistical and systematic uncertainties in most cases can be treated as uncorrelated between measurements. However, a careful treatment of correlated uncertainties due to common usage of branching ratios and theory inputs is essential, as in many measurements these are one of the leading uncertainty sources. In the past several combinations of fragmentationfraction data were performed with fewer inputs: the summary of the charm fragmentation fractions in e + e \u2212 at the Z resonance [25], the combination of e + e \u2212 measurements [26,27] as well as the combination of e + e \u2212 and e \u00b1 p measurements [28]. Compared to those, the present analysis extends to a larger set of measurements, in particular the final measurement in PHP by the ZEUS experiment at HERA [15], the pp measurements from LHCb [19,20], ALICE [21-23], ATLAS [24] and the + c measurements from the BABAR experiment [8]. It uses the up-to-date branching-ratio values [25,29,30], treats correlations of branching-ratio uncertainties and recent theory predictions with reduced uncertainties [31,32] as input.",

The result is more model dependent than the default combination, but has a higher precision. At the same time, the result visibly differs from the result of the default procedure. This may partially be traced to the value S Z = 0.9292 \u00b1 0.0261 for the accurate LEP measurements,   [57,58] are shown with open symbols. Note, that the latter are quoted from the original papers, i.e. without correction to the up-to-date branching ratios and with no branching ratio uncertainty, if not given in the source which differs markedly from 1 (see Sect. 3.2). This difference is also reflected in the larger \u03c7 2 /n dof value compared to the default global combination. The difference in the f (c \u2192 + c ) precision is to a large extent due to inclusion of the precise BABAR data [8].",
