The detector design is based on the BNL E787/E949 experiments, which detected seven K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd candidate events. Two orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity relative to the BNL experiments comes from enhancements to the beam line and the detector acceptance. Precise measurement of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio with the same level of uncertainty as the well-understood Standard Model prediction allows for sensitivity to new physics at and beyond the LHC mass scale.",

Virtual effects in K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd loop diagrams allow us to learn about the flavor-and CPviolating couplings of any new particles that may be discovered at the LHC, and to potentially observe the effects of new particles with masses higher than those accessible by the LHC. The K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio in the Standard Model is precisely predicted by theory. The technique to measure the branching ratio experimentally, though challenging, is well-established, and, because seven candidate K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd events have already been seen, a large signal is assured. For these reasons, precision measurement of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio is an ideal opportunity to test the Standard Model and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.",

Worcester for the ORKA Collaboration) 1 ASU, BNL, FNAL, Illinois, INFN-Napoli, INFN-Pisa, INR-Moscow, JINR, Mississippi, Notre Dame, Texas-Arlington, Texas-Austin, Tsinghua, UBC, UNBC, UASLP The ORKA collaboration proposes to build a stopped-kaon experiment to measure the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio with the same uncertainty as the Standard Model prediction, using protons from the Main Injector at FNAL. The ORKA experiment is the primary topic of this presentation. Section 2 describes the status of the Standard Model calculation of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio, and the potential for new physics to affect that branching ratio. The experimental history and current status of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching ratio measurement are described in 3. Section 4 describes the BNL E787/E949 experiments on which the ORKA design is based, plans to dramatically improve on the sensitivity of these experiments with ORKA, and the current status of the ORKA experiment.

This uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the CKM matrix; in the near future, improvements to the theory and measurements of the CKM elements are expected to reduce it by a factor of two. Therefore, a deviation of the measured decay rate from the SM prediction as small as 30% could be detected with 5\u03c3 significance if the measurement precision matched the theoretical uncertainty. Many models of new physics predict significant enhancements to the Standard Model branching ratios of K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd and K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the range of branching ratio predictions for minimal flavor violation (MFV), Littlest Higgs with T parity (LHT) [2], Randall-Sundrum with custodial protection (RSc) [3], and four quark generations (SM4) [4]. It is interesting to note that tighter constraints on non-SM effects for K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd may be imposed by direct CP violation ( / ), so that less than a factor of two enhancement in this branching ratio would be allowed [5].

Figure 4 shows the momentum spectrum of the outgoing charged particle for K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd signal and important K + -decay background sources. To suppress background to a sufficiently low level, the detector must have excellent \u03c0 + particle identification to reject background from K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, highly efficient 4\u03c0 solid-angle photon veto coverage to reject background from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays, and a K + identification system to remove beam-related background. Figure 4 also shows two kinematic regions that can be used to search for K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd decay in the data; these regions are chosen to avoid background. In the PNN1   : Range in plastic scintillator vs. momentum for charged particles accepted by the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd PNN1 trigger. The concentrations of events resulting from two-body decays are labeled \"K \u03c02 peak\" and \"K \u00b52 peak.\" The decays K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03b3 contribute to the muon band. The pion band results from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03b3 decay in which the \u03c0 + scatters in the target or range stack and beam \u03c0 + that scatter in the target. region, the \u03c0 + momentum lies between the \u03c0 + momentum from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decay and the \u03c0 + kinematic limit of 227 MeV/c. The \u00b5 + momentum from K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decay lies above the \u03c0 + kinematic limit. In the PNN2 region, the \u03c0 + momentum is below that from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decay, but analysis of this region is complicated by having additional sources of background from three-body decays of the K + . Beam related background, in which a K + decays in flight, a beam \u03c0 + scatters in the stopping target, or a K + undergoes charge exchange, must also be considered. Figure 5 shows the range and momentum of the charged particle for all events passing the PNN1 trigger. Background from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 , various 3body decays, and scattered pions are identified.",

The ORKA range stack has increased segmentation relative to the range stack in BNL E949; this will reduce losses from accidental activity and improve \u03c0/\u00b5 particle identification. ORKA will use higher quantum efficiency photodetectors and/or better optical coupling to increase the scintillator light yield, which will improve \u00b5 identification.

The experiment has the strong support of the FNAL PAC and received Stage 1 approval from the FNAL directorate in December 2011. The preferred site for the experiment is B0, so that ORKA can re-use the CDF solenoid, cryogenics, and infrastructure. The ORKA detector is being designed to fit inside the CDF solenoid. Planning and design efforts are underway to decommission CDF in a way that facilitates eventual use of CDF hall by ORKA; this effort is being funded in the FY13 FNAL budget. Plans are being made and beam-line elements are being identified for a beam line to transport protons from the Main Injector extraction point to B0 in the Tevatron tunnel. A preliminary design for the kaon beam line from the production target to the detector has been simulated and is being refined. Research and development on detector design has begun. The collaboration, currently consisting of 16 institutions from six countries, is seeking additional members. Because ORKA is a fourth generation detector, building on experience from BNL E787/E949, an aggressive construction schedule is thought possible. The collaboration plans to start ORKA construction in spring of 2014 and begin taking data by 2017.",
