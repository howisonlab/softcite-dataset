The searches use 20 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV. A likelihood-driven scan of a five-dimensional effective model focusing on the gaugino-higgsino and Higgs sector of the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is performed. This scan uses data from direct dark matter detection experiments, the relic dark matter density and precision flavour physics results. Further constraints from the ATLAS Higgs mass measurement and SUSY searches at LEP are also applied. A subset of models selected from this scan are used to assess the impact of the selected ATLAS searches in this five-dimensional parameter space. These ATLAS searches substantially impact those models for which the mass m(\u03c7 0 1 ) of the lightest neutralino is less than 65 GeV, excluding 86% of such models. The searches have limited impact on models with larger m(\u03c7 0 1 ) due to either heavy electroweakinos or compressed mass spectra where the mass splittings between the produced particles and the lightest supersymmetric particle is small.",

In that work, all 19 of the pMSSM parameters were varied and the strongest direct constraints on sparticle production were obtained in searches for squarks and gluinos. In this article, attention is restricted to a five-dimensional (5D) sub-space of the pMSSM in order to assess the impact of the ATLAS Run-1 searches (using 20 fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 8TeV) specifically on the electroweak production of SUSY particles, and the corresponding constraints on dark matter. This provides a study complementary to that in ref. [26] by decoupling strong-interaction production processes from the phenomenology, and thus allows more extensive exploration of the regions of parameter space relevant to electroweak production. The scanning strategy used to select models is also different to ref. [26], where models were sampled from uniform distributions in the pMSSM parameters, and then required to satisfy a variety of experimental constraints. In this study, an \"initial likelihood scan\" is performed to select models, using constraints from direct dark matter searches, precision electroweak measurements, flavourphysics results, previous collider searches, and the ATLAS Higgs boson mass measurement.",

Three additional signal regions target the more difficult scenario of\u03c7 + 1\u03c7 \u2212 1 production where the charginos decay via W bosons. Finally, a seventh signal region requiring an opposite-sign light-lepton pair (e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) with an invariant mass consistent with a Z boson and an additional pair of jets is used to target\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 2 production where the chargino decays via a W boson and the neutralino decays via a Z boson. The 2\u03c4 analysis [33] uses four signal regions to search for\u03c4 -pair,\u03c7 + 1\u03c7 \u2212 1 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 2 production, where the charginos and neutralinos decay via third-generation sleptons. Events with a pair of opposite-sign hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons (\u03c4 had ) and large m T2 are selected for the search. The 3 analysis [34] searches for weakly interacting SUSY particles in events with three light leptons (e/\u00b5), two light leptons and one \u03c4 had , or one light lepton and two \u03c4 had . Twenty-four signal regions are defined to target\u03c7 Although this article is restricted to these four analyses, other SUSY searches could provide sensitivity in some regions of the parameter space considered in this article. For example, the ATLAS disappearing-track analysis [36] targets direct long-lived charginos with proper lifetimes O(1 ns) so it could have sensitivity to compressed models where the mass difference of the lightest chargino and the LSP is much less than 1GeV. Consideration of this analysis is beyond the scope of this article. Furthermore, the ATLAS monojet search [37] targets pair-produced dark matter particles but makes no assumption of an underlying supersymmetric theory. These results do not yet have sensitivity to direct electroweak SUSY production so is not considered further in this analysis.",

Two different prior distributions are adopted: \"flat priors\" are uniform in all model parameters, while \"log priors\" are uniform in the logarithm of all model parameters, except for tan \u03b2, for which a uniform prior is used for both sets. Flat priors tend to concentrate sampling towards large values of the parameters (as most of volume of the prior lies there), while log priors concentrate their scan in the lower mass ( 1TeV) region (since this metric gives every decade in the parameter values the same a priori probability). The posterior samples resulting from the flat and log prior scans are then merged to achieve a reliable mapping of the (prior-independent) profile likelihood function, as advocated in ref. [38].

One difference with respect to the published analyses is that signal regions that would normally be statistically combined in the likelihood fit are now treated as separate signal regions, and CL s values are calculated for each region. Similarly, for binned signal regions each bin is treated separately. The results from the 500 models are used to fit a \"calibration function\" between the particle-level yields and the CL s values for each signal region. This accounts for the SM background prediction in each signal region, together with the observed data. There is one remaining free parameter, which roughly corresponds to the average selection efficiency for SUSY events that pass the particle-level selection. Only those signal regions where the average efficiency could be determined with a statistical precision of better than 20% are considered in the final analysis. In addition, it is required that at least one of the 500 models is excluded, with expected and observed CL s < 0.05. Of the original 44 signal regions, 25 pass these requirements. The 19 rejected signal regions typically have a low acceptance for the EWKH models, due to either very stringent kinematic criteria, or a requirement for \u03c4 had candidates, which have a low yield in the EWKH models considered, due to JHEP09(2016)175 the very high mass of the stau. The real selection efficiency varies from model to model, and the calibration procedure therefore can only gives accurate results when averaged over many models. No additional systematic uncertainty for model-to-model variations is applied.",

Large values of the cross-section are not penalised in the likelihood scan because the scaling factor \u03be given in Equation (3.5) reduces the predicted number of recoil events, weakening both the XENON100 and LUX constraints. The largest cross-sections are achieved when the\u03c7 0 1 acquires some higgsino component, whereas crosssections are suppressed when the\u03c7 0 1 has an increased bino or wino component in the low/intermediate\u03c7 0 1 mass regions.
