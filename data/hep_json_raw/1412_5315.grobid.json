            "text": "The dominant processes contributing to W + c-jet production are qg \u2192 W c and qq \u2192 W g followed by g \u2192 cc. The production cross section for the first process is sensitive to the quark and gluon parton density functions (PDFs). Since the c-b quark Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element is very small (|V cb | 2 \u2248 0.0016) [5], the contribution of a b-quark initial state in the PDF is negligible. Comparing the d-quark and s-quark PDFs, the probability of interaction of a gluon with a d-quark is greater than that with an s-quark, but the CKM matrix element suppresses d \u2192 c transitions since |V cd | 2 \u2248 0.04. As a result, the expected contributions from s-quark and d-quark initial states for a jet transverse momentum p jet T > 20 GeV at the Tevatron are around 85% and 15%, respectively [6]. According to the alpgen + pythia [7,8] simulation for W + c-jet events, the contribution from qg \u2192 W + c dominates the entire 20 < p jet T < 100 GeV region with the contribution from qq \u2192 W + cc events increasing from about 25% to 45% as jet p T increases from 20 to 100 GeV. Measurement of the pp \u2192 W + c-jet differential cross section should provide information about the s-quark PDF. This PDF has been measured directly only in fixed target neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering experiments at relatively low momentum transfer Q 15-20 GeV [9][10][11][12][13][14]. A probe of the s-quark PDF at the Tevatron tests the universality of s(x, Q 2 ), where x is the Feynman variable [15], and its QCD evolution up to Q 2 10 4 GeV 2 .",

The previous D0 and CDF measurements are inclusive; the CMS and ATLAS inclusive results were augmented by distributions in the pseudorapidity of the lepton from W decay. It is important to note that the measurements listed above are performed by requiring opposite electric charges of a soft lepton inside a jet from semileptonic charmed hadron decay with a lepton from W decay elsewhere in the event, and measuring the cross section for \"opposite-sign\" (OS) minus \"same-sign\" (SS) events. A requirement of opposite signs for the leptons and subtraction of events with the same signs suppresses the sign-symmetric backgrounds as well as W + cc events due to gluon splitting, which become significant at high jet p T . All measurements are in agreement with the perturbative next-toleading order (NLO) QCD predictions [20,21] that include contributions from gluon splitting within total theoretical uncertainties of 15-30%.",

We use pythia with CTEQ6L1 [34] PDFs. alpgen generates multi-parton final states using tree-level matrix elements (ME). When interfaced with pythia, it employs the MLM scheme [7] to treat ME partons produced from showering in pythia. For the signal process, we also use the sherpa MC generator [35] that matches partons from the leading-order ME with up to two real parton emissions to the parton-shower jets according to the CKWK matching scheme [36]. The generated events are processed through a geant-based [37] simulation of the D0 detector geometry and response. To accurately model the effects of multiple pp interactions and detector noise, events from random pp crossings with a similar instantaneous luminosity spectrum as in data are overlaid on the MC events. These MC events are then processed using the same reconstruction code as for the data. The MC events are also weighted to take into account the trigger efficiency and small observed differences between MC and data in the distributions of the instantaneous luminosity and of the z coordinate of the pp collision vertex.",

The Z -boson p T distribution is modeled to match the distribution observed in data [39], taking into account the dependence on the number of reconstructed jets. To reproduce the W -boson p T distribution in simulated events, we use the product of the measured Z -boson p T spectrum times the ratio of W to Z -boson p T distributions at NLO [39,40]. The NLO + NNLL (next-to-next-to-leading log) calculations are used to normalize tt production [41], while single top quark production is normalized to NNLO predictions [42]. The NLO W W , W Z, and Z Z production cross section values are obtained with the mcfm program [43]. The multijet background contribution is estimated from data using the \"matrix method\" [30]. For the final states studied here the multijet background is small ( 2%) and arises mainly from the semileptonic decays of heavy quarks in which the muon satisfies the isolation requirements. To reduce the contribution from tt production that increases with jet p T , we restrict the scalar sum of all the jet p T values (H T ) to be less than 175 GeV. This requirement reduces the tt fraction by a factor 1.5-2, depending on jet p T , and has signal efficiency greater than 95% except in the highest PT bin where it falls to 82%. The tt fraction after the H T cut varies between 5 and 20% with increasing jet p T . Identification of b and c jets is crucial for this measurement.",

These criteria ensure sufficient information to classify the jet as a heavyflavor candidate and have a typical efficiency of about 90%. Light parton jets (those resulting from light quarks or gluons) are suppressed using a dedicated artificial neural network (b-NN) [44] that exploits the longer lifetimes of heavy-flavor hadrons relative to their lighter counterparts. The inputs to the b-NN include several characteristic quantities of the jet and associated tracks to provide a continuous output value that tends towards one for b jets and zero for the light jets. The b-NN input variables providing most of the discrimination are the number of reconstructed secondary vertices (SV) in the jet, the invariant mass of charged particle tracks associated with the SV (M SV ), the number of tracks used to reconstruct the SV, the two-dimensional decay length significance of the SV in the plane transverse to the beam, a weighted combination of the tracks' transverse impact parameter significances, and the probability that the tracks associated with the jet originate from the pp interaction vertex, which is referred to as the jet lifetime probability (JLIP). The jet is required to have a b-NN output greater than 0.5. For jet p T in a range between 20 and 150 GeV this selection is (36-47)% efficient for b-jets and (8-11)% efficient for c jets with relative systematic uncertainties of (4.2-6.5)% for both the b jets and c jets. The systematic uncertainty is obtained from a comparison of the heavy flavor tagging efficiencies in data and MC as described in [44]. Only 0.2-0.4% of light jets are misidentified as heavy-flavor jets and comprise 7% to 15% of the final sample, with a larger fraction at lower jet p T . In addition to the b-NN output, we obtain further information by combining the M SV and JLIP variables, which provide good discrimination between b, c, and light quark jets due to their different masses [45,46]. We form a single subtracted from the D MJL distribution in data before the fit. The ratio of the W + light parton jets to W + all jet flavors has been estimated using alpgen + pythia MC events taking into account the data-to-MC correction factors as described in Ref. [44], and has been cross checked in data using looser cuts on b-NN output in the range from 0.15-0.3.",
