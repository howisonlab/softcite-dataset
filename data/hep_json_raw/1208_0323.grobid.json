We also measure for the first time the longitudinal polarization fraction of B 0 s \u2192 D Decays of B s mesons help elucidate the weak Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa structure of the Standard Model (SM). B s decays can be studied at e + e \u2212 colliders by running at the \u03a5(5S) resonance, which subsequently decays to B Here we substantially improve this measurement using 121.4 fb \u22121 of data. In addition to the five-times-larger data set, there are other improvements to the analysis: the data have been fully reprocessed using reconstruction algorithms with higher efficiency for \u03c0 0 's and low momentum tracks; we use larger control samples to evaluate systematic uncertainties; and we take background probability density functions directly from data rather than from simulation. We also make the first measurement of the fraction of longitudinal polarization",

These are expected to be mostly CP -even, and their partial widths are expected to dominate the difference in widths between the two B s -B s CP eigenstates, \u2206\u0393 CP s [2]. This parameter equals \u2206\u0393 s / cos \u03c6 12 , where \u2206\u0393 s is the decay width difference between the mass eigenstates, and \u03c6 12 = arg(\u2212M 12 /\u0393 12 ), where M 12 and \u0393 12 are the offdiagonal elements of the B s -B s mass and decay matrices [3]. The phase \u03c6 12 is the CP -violating phase in B s -B s mixing. Thus the branching fraction gives a constraint in the \u2206\u0393 s -\u03c6 12 parameter space. Both parameters can receive contributions from new physics (NP) [4,5]. Previous constraints on \u2206\u0393 s and NP contributions to \u03c6 12 were obtained from a time-dependent angular analysis of B s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decays [6][7][8]. A constraint on \u03c6 12 can be derived from the CP asymmetry measured in B s semileptonic decays [9].",

Inserting all values gives the branching fractions listed in Table I. These results have similar precision as other recent measurements [20] and are in agreement with theoretical predictions [21,22]. The statistical significance is calculated as \u22122 ln(L 0 /L max ), where L 0 and L max are the values of the likelihood function when the signal yield Y i is fixed to zero and when it is floated, respectively.
