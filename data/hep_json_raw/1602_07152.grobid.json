Trilinear gauge boson vertices are a consequence of this symmetry, and the values of the self-couplings are fixed in the SM. Any measured deviation would be an indication of physics beyond the standard model at that vertex. For production of a Z boson and a photon, these couplings are zero in the SM. New symmetries or new particles that only become relevant at higher energies could result in a cross section that differs from the SM prediction [1,2], particularly for final-state bosons with high transverse momentum.",

The \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 final state can be produced through initial-state radiation (where a photon is emitted by an initial-state parton) or through anomalous coupling vertices. The allowed electroweak tree-level diagram in the SM for Z\u03b3 production in pp collisions is shown in Fig. 1 (top). The s-channel production via a ZZ\u03b3 or Z\u03b3 \u03b3 aTGC is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). The most general Lorentz-invariant and gauge-invariant ZV\u03b3 vertex can be described by four coupling parameters h V photon transverse momentum spectrum has similar sensitivity to CP-violating and CP-conserving couplings. The results are generally interpreted in terms of the CP-conserving aTGCs h V 3 and h V 4 . The sensitivity to aTGCs in Z\u03b3 production is higher in the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decay mode than in Z boson decay modes with charged leptons, because the branching fraction for a Z boson decay to a pair of neutrinos is six times higher than for a decay to a particular charged lepton pair, and the acceptance in the neutrino channel is higher.",

Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gasionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The energy resolution for photons with transverse momentum \u2265 60 GeV varies between 1% and 2.5% over the solid angle of the ECAL barrel, and from 2.5% to 3.5% in the endcaps [9].

The energy in the HCAL associated with the photon supercluster should not exceed 5% of its energy as measured in the ECAL. Moreover, the photon candidates must have a shower distribution in the ECAL consistent with that expected for an electromagnetic (EM) shower [9]. To further reduce photon contamination arising from misidentified jets, isolation requirements on photon candidates are imposed. Energy deposits for isolation are obtained by considering particles in a cone around the axis defined by the supercluster position and the primary vertex [9]. In particular, the scalar sum of transverse momenta (in GeV) of all photons within a cone of R = 0.3 around the supercluster, excluding a strip of width in \u03b7 of 0.015, is required to be less than 0.7 + 0.005p \u03b3 T ; the scalar sum of the transverse momenta (in GeV) of all charged hadrons, associated with the primary vertex, within a hollow cone of 0.02 < R < 0.30 around the supercluster is required to be less than 1.5; and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta (in GeV) of all neutral hadrons within a cone of R = 0.3 around the supercluster is required to be less than 1.0 + 0.04p \u03b3 T . Due to the large number of additional proton-proton interactions (pileup) in the same bunch crossing at the LHC, it is difficult to know the true origin of the photon for a \u03b3 + / E T final state (our estimate is correct 50% of the time), which could lead to an underestimation of isolation values. Therefore, an additional PF-based charged particle isolation is calculated for each vertex and the largest value of this isolation sum is required to be smaller than the nominal threshold used for charged particle isolation.",

The method is based on a class of jets, referred to as \"photon-like\" jets, that have properties similar to electromagnetic objects. Photon-like jets are required to pass a very loose photon selection but at the same time fail one of the isolation requirements. The method also relies on the ratio of jets passing the full photon selection to those identified as photonlike jets. This ratio is measured in a control sample enriched in QCD multijet events. To suppress the contribution of electroweak processes, the missing transverse energy in this control sample is required to be smaller than 30 GeV. Because this sample also contains true isolated photons from QCD direct photon production, this contribution must be subtracted from the numerator of the ratio. The required correction is estimated by performing a fit to the distribution of the candidate shower width variable \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 [9]. Two shower shape profiles are used in this fit, the shower shape of true photons, obtained from simulated \u03b3 + jet events, and the shower shape of photon-like jets, obtained from the charged hadron isolation sideband in data. This corrected ratio is used to weight a set of data events where the photon candidate passes the photon-like jet selection criteria. The estimated number of background events is found to be 45 \u00b1 14, where the uncertainty reflects an uncertainty in the estimation of the ratio, as well as the statistical uncertainty of the sample scaled for the final estimate.",

Additionally, there are systematic uncertainties due to the jet energy scale and jet resolution in the measurement of / E T , which give +2.3 \u22122.3 % and +1.2 \u22121.4 %, respectively, and the unclustered energy scale, which gives +1.9 \u22120.6 %. For pileup, a central value for the total inelastic cross section of 69.4 mb [28,29] is used. A variation of \u00b15% in the number of interactions is used to cover the uncertainty in A due to pileup modeling, which is 0.3%. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity [30] is 2.6%. Other sources include the uncertainty in the correction factor \u03c1, which contributes 6.4%.",
