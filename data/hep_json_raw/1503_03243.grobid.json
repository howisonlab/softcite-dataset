The fiducial cross section for this process is measured in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS detector in 2012. Events are selected using the W boson decay to e\u03bd or \u03bc\u03bd as well as requiring two isolated photons. The measured cross section is used to set limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings in the high diphoton mass region.",

            "text": "In the standard model (SM), the self-couplings of the electroweak gauge bosons are specified by the non-Abelian SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de structure of the electroweak sector. Since any deviation in the self-couplings from this expectation indicates the presence of new physics phenomena at unprobed energy scales, the measurement of the production of multiple electroweak gauge bosons represents an important test of the SM. This Letter presents a measurement of the triboson production cross section, discussed in Ref. [1], where the W boson decays into e\u03bd or \u03bc\u03bd [W\u00f0l\u03bd\u00de\u03b3\u03b3], and its sensitivity to anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) WW\u03b3\u03b3. Such final states mainly come from events where the W boson is produced in the hard interaction between the two partons, and the photons either originate from initial or final state radiation processes, or from triple or quartic gauge vertices together with the W boson. The inclusive and exclusive cross sections are both measured. The inclusive case has no restriction on the W\u03b3\u03b3 recoil system, whereas the exclusive case includes a veto on events containing one or more jets. Limits on AQGC parameters are set in the exclusive phase space with a diphoton mass larger than 300 GeV. Total and differential cross sections for the diboson production processes WW, WZ, ZZ, W\u03b3, and Z\u03b3 have been reported previously by the ATLAS [2][3][4][5], CMS [6][7][8], D0 [9][10][11], and CDF [12][13][14] Collaborations, including limits on anomalous triple gauge boson couplings. Limits have been set on AQGCs by ATLAS [15], CMS [16,17], the LEP experiments [18][19][20][21], and D0 [22].",

Muon candidates are identified, within pseudorapidity [26] j\u03b7j < 2.4, by associating complete tracks or track segments in the MS with tracks in the ID [41]. Electron candidates are reconstructed within j\u03b7j < 2.47 as electromagnetic clusters associated to a track [42], whereas photons are reconstructed as electromagnetic clusters with j\u03b7j < 2. 37 [43]. The calorimeter transition regions at 1.37 < j\u03b7j < 1.52 are excluded for electrons and photons. Identification criteria based on shower shapes in the EM calorimeter for photons, and additionally on tracking information for electrons, referred to as \"tight\" in Refs. [42,44], are used. The E miss T uses the energy deposits in the calorimeters within j\u03b7j < 4.9 and the muons identified in the MS, as described in Ref. [45]. Reconstructed muons, electrons, and photons are required to have p \u03bc;e;\u03b3 T > 20 GeV and to be isolated. Photons are considered isolated if the sum of calorimeter transverse energy deposits in a cone of size \u0394R \u00bc 0.4 around the candidate is smaller than 4 GeV.

For electrons, the calorimeter transverse energy deposits and the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks in a cone of size \u0394R \u00bc 0.2 must be below 0.2 \u00d7 p e T and 0.15 \u00d7 p e T , respectively.

The two photons must be outside of their mutual isolation cones by requiring \u0394R\u00f0\u03b3; \u03b3\u00de > 0.4. To suppress the contribution from final-state radiation, the lepton and photons are required to have \u0394R\u00f0l; \u03b3\u00de > 0.7. Events containing a second reconstructed lepton are rejected to reduce background from Drell-Yan events. In the electron channel, additional requirements are used to suppress events in which one electron is misidentified as a photon (mainly originated from the Z\u03b3 process): the transverse momentum of the e\u03b3\u03b3 system is required to be greater than 30 GeV, and the invariant mass of the electron and the leading, subleading or both photons is required to be outside a 13, 8 or 15 GeV wide window around the Z boson mass, respectively. Exclusive events are defined with a veto on additional jets compared to the inclusive selection. Jets are reconstructed from clustered energy deposits in the calorimeter using the anti-k t algorithm [47] with radius parameter R \u00bc 0.4 and are required to have p T > 30 GeV and j\u03b7j < 4.4. Jets at \u0394R < 0.3 from the selected lepton and photons are rejected. In order to reduce pileup effects, for jets with p T < 50 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.4, more than 50% of the summed scalar p T of tracks within \u0394R \u00bc 0.4 of the jet axis must be from tracks associated to the primary vertex. Table I shows the expected background as well as the observation. The background expectation alone is not sufficient to describe the data indicating the presence of signal events. The fake-photon background from W\u03b3j \u00fe Wjj is estimated by performing a two-dimensional template fit to the isolation energy distributions of the leading and subleading photons, as described in Ref. [48]. Three background templates are obtained from data by reversing some of the photon identification requirements based on shower shape; the signal templates are taken from MC simulation. Contributions from events where a jet satisfies the electron identification criteria, or the muon originates from heavy-flavor decays, i.e. from \u03b3\u03b3 \u00fe jets processes, are estimated by using a two-dimensional sideband method constructed from the lepton isolation and E miss T variables, as described in Ref. [5]. The distribution of the diphoton invariant mass in the two channels is shown in Fig. 1. Alternative methods have been used to cross-check the estimate of the backgrounds coming from fakes, all of them provide consistent results. In the estimation of the fakephoton background, systematic uncertainties arise from the limited number of events in the control regions, the functional form used to describe the background isolation energy distribution, the definition of the control region, the modeling of the signal in the MC samples and the corresponding statistical uncertainty. In the estimate of the fake-lepton background, systematic uncertainties related to TABLE I. The background composition in each channel is shown for the inclusive (left) and exclusive (right) cases. The W\u03b3j \u00fe Wjj and \u03b3\u03b3 \u00fe jets backgrounds are estimated using data-driven techniques, whereas the others are extracted from MC simulation. The number of candidate events in data passing the full selection is also shown.",

The  031802-3 calculations are performed using the MCFM default electroweak parameters [50] and the CT10 PDF set. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to the invariant mass of the l\u03bd\u03b3\u03b3 system. The fragmentation of quarks and gluons to photons is included using the fragmentation function GDRG_LO [51]. The kinematic requirements at parton level match the fiducial acceptance of Table II. In addition to the inclusive prediction, an exclusive cross section is obtained by vetoing events with an additional jet emission. To account for the difference between jets defined at parton and particle levels, a correction factor of about 0.87 in the exclusive case is computed and applied to the prediction as documented in Ref. [5]. Uncertainties on the two predictions include the effect of varying independently the renormalization and factorization scales by factors of 0.5 and 2.0, evaluating the CT10 PDF error sets scaled to the 68% confidence level (C.L.), the uncertainties on quark or gluon fragmentation to a photon, and the parton to particle correction factors.

The measured cross section is higher by 1.9\u03c3 in the inclusive case, while better agreement is seen in the exclusive case, similar to the measurement of W\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 in Ref. [5]. In the case of Z\u03b3 and W\u03b3, higher order corrections were calculated to be smaller for the exclusive compared to the inclusive case [52]. As the process W\u03b3\u03b3 has similar properties, the exclusive measurement is expected to be in better agreement with the theoretical prediction than the inclusive one. Therefore, in the following, the exclusive measurement will be used for the AQGC limits setting, as done in Ref. [5].",

            "text": "The AQGCs are introduced as dimension-8 operators following the formalism defined in the Appendix of Ref. [53]. While many operators give rise to anomalous couplings of the form WW\u03b3\u03b3, this study is restricted to f T0 =\u039b 4 , f M2 =\u039b 4 , and f M3 =\u039b 4 , where \u039b represents the scale at which new physics appears, and f the coupling of the respective operator. The W\u03b3\u03b3 final state is expected to be particularly sensitive to the T0 operator, whereas the other two operators can be related to the parameters of the dimension-6 operators used at LEP [18][19][20][21] and by CMS [16] via the transformations described in Ref. [54]. To preserve unitarity up to high energy scales, a form factor is introduced which depends on the energy, the form factor scale \u039b FF and an exponent n, following the formalism described in Refs. [55,56]. The scale \u039b FF is independent of the new physics scale \u039b [57]. The largest form factor scale ensuring unitarity for this process at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, calculated using the VBFNLO generator [58][59][60][61], is given by n \u00bc 2 and \u039b FF \u00bc 600 GeV for f T0 =\u039b 4 , and \u039b FF \u00bc 500 GeV for f M2 =\u039b 4 and f M3 =\u039b 4 . Deviations from the SM prediction for the AQGC parameters, which are predicted to be zero, lead to an excess of events with high diphoton invariant mass. The phase space to study AQGCs was optimized using the expected significance calculated on simulated events. The optimal phase space was found to be the exclusive selection with the additional requirement of m \u03b3\u03b3 > 300 GeV. The SM backgrounds in this region are determined from a fit to the observed m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution. The expected SM background is 0.01 AE 0.03\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.20\u00f0syst\u00de [0.02 AE 0.05\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.46\u00f0syst\u00de] events in the electron (muon) channel, where uncertainties include systematic effects due to the extrapolation procedure, depending on the modeling of the spectrum and on the initial background estimate used in the extrapolation. No events are observed in the high-mass region.",

The limits on the AQGC parameters are extracted with a frequentist profile likelihood test [62], using the methodology of Ref. [5]. The expected and observed limits at 95% C.L. on the AQGC parameters are shown in Table IV for different values of n. The limits on f M2 =\u039b 4 and f M3 =\u039b 4 improve on the previous results from LEP [18][19][20][21] and D0 [22], but are less stringent than those from CMS [16,17]. The limit on f T0 =\u039b 4 is tighter than the previous limit published by CMS [17,63]. This can be explained by the fact that f T0 =\u039b 4 is especially sensitive to transversely polarized W bosons, which are favored in the present study [53].",
