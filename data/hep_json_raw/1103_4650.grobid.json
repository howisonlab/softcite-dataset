            "text": "At hadron colliders, the search for high-mass dilepton resonances has the advantage of very low hadronic backgrounds and well-understood electroweak backgrounds. The search for dielectron resonances is additionally motivated by the event excess at a dielectron mass M ee = 240 GeV/c 2 reported by a CDF analysis [1] performed with an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb \u22121 . Moreover, a recent CDF search [2] for Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravitons decaying to diphotons will benefit significantly from the addition of the dielectron decay channel. The RS model [3] solves the hierarchy problem by introducing an extra compact dimension accessible only to gravity. The phenomenology of this model leads to a small number of distinct Kaluza-Klein states (spin-2 gravitons G) that couple to SM particles and can be individually detected as resonances of pairs of jets, leptons, photons or gauge bosons. Other possible sources of dielectron resonances include the production of heavy spin-1 (e.g., Z \u2032 [4]) and spin-0 particles (e.g., Higgs boson [5] and supersymmetric particles [6]).",

To ensure a uniform trigger response, we require the central electron to have p T > 20 GeV/c. A supplementary trigger, more efficient especially for electrons with p T > 70 GeV/c, is also used. The second electron can pass either through the central or forward detector region and it is required to have p T > 5 GeV/c. The tracking system provides the direction of the electrons, whereas the absolute value of their 3-momentum is determined from the energy deposited in the calorimeters. This energy deposition is required to geometrically match the track and the deposition's lateral shape must be consistent with that expected from electrons. The additional transverse calorimeter energy deposited in a cone of \u2206R = (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 = 0.4 around each electron must be less than 10% of its transverse energy. The electrons are required to be separated by \u2206R > 0.4 and to have the z coordinate of their tracks at the origin within |\u2206z| < 5 cm. The average z position of the two tracks must be within 4 cm of an interaction vertex. Finally, each electron must have a track with an impact parameter less than 0.02 cm, if the track is reconstructed including information from the silicon detector, or less than 0.2 cm otherwise. The forward electrons can be linked to special silicononly tracks in order to extend the reach in \u03b7 beyond that of the drift chamber coverage.

The total MC systematic uncertainty on the expected event yield is \u223c 10 %. The respective QCD-background systematic uncertainty is \u223c 50 %, which comes from the variation in the measurement of the fake probabilities using different jet-rich CDF datasets triggered with varied jet-energy thresholds. Since the SM background is very low in the high dielectron-mass region of interest, the results are not overly sensitive to the systematic uncertainties. Figure 1(a) shows the M ee spectrum for SM expectation and CDF data. We observe good agreement in the Z-boson resonance region, which validates our efficiencies, scale factors, data luminosity and theoretical cross sections. We observe a long mass tail coming mainly from the DY process. Figure 1(b) shows the M ee spectrum between 200 and 600 GeV/c 2 ; above 200 GeV/c 2 , we expect 793 \u00b1 96 events and observe 801.

Calorimeter resolution induces an uncertainty on the dielectron mass of 16 GeV/c 2 for this event. The two electrons have transverse momenta of 482 and 468 GeV/c; they originate from the same primary vertex and are oppositely charged. The event is characterized by very low hadronic activity (no jets are reconstructed) and by a low missing transverse energy of 17 GeV -separated by 23 degrees in \u03c6 from the 468 GeV/c electron -coming most probably from the resolution of the calorimeter.",

Here N i pseudo follows a Poisson distribution convoluted with a Gaussian of mean equal to N i SM and standard deviation equal to the SM systematic uncertainty for the i-th bin. Figure 2 shows the p-value as a function of the M ee . The band defines the 1-\u03c3 expected range of the minimum p-value that could be observed in any mass bin. This range is calculated from the probability distribution of minimum p-values determined with the use of pseudoexperiments. The probability to observe a SM event with M ee \u2265 960 GeV/c 2 is 4%. Above 600 GeV/c 2 , we expect 3.6 \u00b1 0.4 events and observe three. The second most significant excess of events is observed at \u223c320 GeV/c 2 , as shown in Fig. 2.",

            "text": "The measured M ee spectrum can be used to set a limit on RS-graviton production. Here we parametrize the RS model using the mass of the lightest RS graviton (m 1 ) and the dimensionless parameter \u221a 8\u03c0k/M P l \u2261 k/M P l , where k is the curvature scale of the extra dimension and M P l is the Planck mass. RS-graviton sig- nal MC is generated using pythia and values of m 1 from 200 to 1100 GeV/c 2 . The signal-MC events are normalized in the same manner as the background-MC events. The leading-order pythia cross section is multiplied by a scale (\"K-factor\") to correct for next-toleading-order effects. The CDF acceptance for the dielectron RS-graviton signal, determined using MC, is \u223c27%. The acceptance is approximately independent of the RS-graviton mass due to the inclusion of forward electrons, as lower-mass gravitons (m 1 < 700 GeV/c 2 ) would decay to at least one forward lepton more often than higher-mass gravitons. The RS-graviton decays to two jets (branching ratio BR=70%), two charged leptons (BR=6%), two neutrinos (BR=6%), two photons (BR=4%) and two weak bosons (BR=14%). For graviton masses above 200 GeV/c 2 , these branching ratios are graviton-mass-independent. Given the considerable dijet background in a hadron-collider environment, and the low leptonic branching fraction of the weak bosons, the prompt dilepton and diphoton final states offer the greatest sensitivity. The inclusion of dielectrons in the diphoton RS search [2] results in a 50% increase in the rate of potentially produced signal. Here we present the cross section and mass limits for the dielectron channel alone and for the combined dielectron and diphoton channels. Figure 3(a) shows the 95% confidence level (C.L.) cross-section (\u03c3 \u00d7 BR(G \u2192 ee)) upper limit as a function of the lightest RS-graviton mass m 1 along with five theoretical cross-section curves for k/M P l = 0.01 to 0.1, a theoretically interesting range that would provide a solution for the fine-tuning problem. The limits are set using a frequentist method that compares the backgroundonly with the signal+background hypotheses, taking into account correlated background systematic uncertainties  2,18]. The intersection of the cross-section exclusion limit with the theoretical cross-section curves gives the 95% C.L. lower limit on m 1 for the respective coupling. For k/M P l = 0.1, the dielectron-only m 1 lower limit is 914 GeV/c 2 , if we use proper mass-dependent RSgraviton K-factors [19,20], and 935 GeV/c 2 assuming a fixed K-factor of 1.54 [7], for comparison with previous results [1,7]. For m 1 > 700 GeV/c 2 , the dielectron-only analysis excludes cross sections greater than 2 fb at the 95% C.L. Figure 3(b) shows the 95% C.L. cross-section (\u03c3 \u00d7 BR(G \u2192 ee/\u03b3\u03b3)) upper limit from the combination of the dielectron and diphoton analyses. The two analyses are combined as independent channels bound by a common production cross section and some correlated systematic uncertainties [18]. For k/M P l = 0.1, the combined m 1 lower limit is 1058 GeV/c 2 , if we use proper mass-dependent RS-graviton K-factors, and 1092 GeV/c 2 assuming a fixed K-factor of 1.54. For m 1 > 700 GeV/c 2 , the combined ee/\u03b3\u03b3 analysis excludes cross sections greater than 0.9 fb at the 95% C.L. Figure 4 shows the exclusions in the k/M P l vs. m 1 parameter space for the dielectron analysis, the diphoton analysis and their combination. For k/M P l = 0.1, the inclusion of electrons improves the previous CDF RSgraviton limit [2] by \u223c95 GeV/c 2 and surpasses the previous published [7] best limit by \u223c40 GeV/c 2 . Table I summarizes the combined ee/\u03b3\u03b3 RS-graviton lower mass limits for different values of k/M P l .",
