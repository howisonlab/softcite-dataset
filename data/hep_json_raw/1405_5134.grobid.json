The measured asymmetries provide evidence at the 3-sigma level for positive gluon polarization in the Bjorken-x region x > 0.05. A fundamental and long-standing puzzle in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) concerns how the intrinsic spins and orbital angular momenta of the quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons sum to give the proton spin of /2 [1]. The flavor-summed quark and anti-quark spin contributions, \u2206\u03a3, account for less than a third of the total proton spin [2][3][4][5][6]. Due to the limited range in momentum transfer at fixed Bjorken-x accessed by fixed-target experiments, the polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data used to extract \u2206\u03a3 provide only loose constraints on the gluon spin contribution, \u2206G, via scaling violations.",

The NLO pQCD calculations indicate that mid-rapidity jet production at RHIC is dominated by quark-gluon (qg) and gluon-gluon (gg) scattering, which together account for 60 \u2212 90% of the total yield for the jet transverse momenta studied here.

The data presented here were extracted from an integrated luminosity of 20 pb \u22121 recorded in the year 2009 with the STAR detector [17] at RHIC. The polarization was measured independently for each of the two counterrotating proton beams (hereafter designated blue (B) and yellow (Y)) and for each fill using Coulomb-nuclear interference proton-carbon polarimeters [18], calibrated via a polarized atomic hydrogen gas-jet target [19]. Averaged over RHIC fills, the luminosity-weighted polarization values for the two beams were P B = 0.574 and P Y = 0.573, with a 6.5% relative uncertainty on the product P B P Y [20]. The helicity patterns of the colliding beam bunches were changed between beam fills to minimize systematic uncertainties in the A LL measurement. The asymmetry A LL is determined from the ratio of yields for different beam-spin configurations, as in our prior work [7][8][9]. Detector acceptance, trigger efficiency, and several other effects cancel in this ratio. Segmented Beam-Beam Counters (BBC) [21], symmetrically located on either side of the STAR interaction point and covering the pseudo-rapidity range 3.4 < |\u03b7| < 5.0, measured the helicity-dependent relative luminosities and served as local polarimeters.",

Because the TPC reconstructs the momentum of all charged particles, the inclusion of tower energy from charged hadrons results in an overestimation of the jet momentum. Fluctuations in the deposited tower energy when charged hadrons interact with calorimeter materials further distort the jet momentum and degrade the jet momentum resolution. In previous STAR jet analyses [7][8][9], this hadronic energy was accounted for by subtracting energy corresponding to a MIP from the energy deposited in any BEMC or EEMC tower with a charged track passing through it, and then using simulations to estimate the residual correction. In this analysis, the E T of the matched tower was adjusted by subtracting either p T c of the charged track or E T , whichever was less. This procedure reduces the residual jet momentum corrections. It also reduces the sensitivity to fluctuations in the hadronic energy deposition, resulting in an improved jet momentum resolution of 18% compared to 23% in previous analyses. The bottom panel of Fig. 1 demonstrates that this new \"p T subtraction\" scheme leads to an average for the neutral energy fraction (NEF) of the jet energy that is close to the value of about 1/3 expected from isospin considerations.",

Parton jets are formed from the hard-scattered partons produced in the collision, including those from initial-and final-state radiation, but not those from the underlying event or beam remnants. Previous STAR analyses [7][8][9] corrected the data back to the particle level. Here, we correct the data to the parton jet level because parton jets provide a better representation of the jets in an NLO pQCD calculation. The antik T algorithm with R = 0.6 was used to reconstruct parton jets for the simulated PYTHIA events described above.

Each sum is over individual runs that were 10 to 60 minutes long, a period much shorter than typical time variations in critical quantities such as P B,Y and r. Values of r were measured run-byrun, and range from 0.8 to 1.2. The STAR trigger biases the data sample by altering the subprocess fractional contributions (gg vs. qg vs. qq). At low p T , the JP efficiency for quark jets is approximately 25% larger than for gluon jets. For p T > 20 GeV/c, the differences are negligible. Similarly, detector and trigger resolutions may smear and distort the measured A LL values. The size of these effects depends on the value and shape of the polarized gluon distribution as a function of Bjorken-x. The A LL values for detector jets were corrected for trigger and reconstruction bias effects by using the simulation to compare the observed asymmetries at the detector and parton jet levels. The PYTHIA event generator does not have options to simulate polarization effects in proton-proton collisions, but asymmetries can be constructed by using the kinematics of the hard interaction to access polarized and unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) and calculate the expected asymmetry on an event-by-event basis. In this way, the trigger and reconstruction biases were calculated for a range of polarized PDFs that bracket the measured A LL values. The average of the minimum and maximum A parton LL \u2212 A detector LL values for each jet p T bin was used to correct the measured A LL by amounts ranging from 0.0002 at low p T to 0.0011 at high p T , and half the difference was assigned as a (correlated) systematic uncertainty. Figure 2 shows the inclusive jet A LL plotted as a function of parton jet p T for two \u03b7 bins. The vertical size of the shaded uncertainty bands on the A LL points in Fig.  2 reflects the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertainties due to corrections for the trigger and reconstruction bias (2 \u2212 55 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and asymmetries associated with the residual transverse polarizations of the beams (3 \u2212 26 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). The trigger and reconstruction bias contributions are dominated by the statistics of the simulation sample. The residual transverse polarization contributions are dominated by the statistical uncertainties in the measurement of the relevant transverse double-spin asymmetry (A \u03a3 ) [9]. Both of these uncertainties are primarily point-to-point fluctuating. Contributions to A LL from non-collision backgrounds were estimated to be less than 2% of the statistical uncertainty on A LL for all jet p T bins and deemed negligible. Likewise, uncertainties associated with the possible dependence of the underlying event on the configuration of the beam spins were neglected. The relative luminosity uncertainty (\u00b15\u00d710 \u22124 ), which is common to all the points, is shown by the gray bands on the horizontal axes. It was estimated by comparing the relative luminosities calculated with the BBCs and Zero-Degree Calorimeters [17], and from inspection of a number of asymmetries expected to yield null results. The horizontal size of the shaded error bands reflects the systematic uncertainty on the corrected jet p T . This in-cludes calorimeter tower gain and efficiency and TPC tracking efficiency and momentum resolution effects. An additional uncertainty has been added in quadrature to account for the difference between the PYTHIA parton jet and NLO pQCD jet cross sections. The PYTHIA vs. NLO pQCD difference dominates for most bins, making the parton jet p T uncertainties highly correlated. The values for A LL by p T bin, their uncertainties, and correlations are given in [28] together with particle and parton jet p T .",

In their recent work [34], NNPDF finds that the integral of \u2206g(x, Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) over the range 0.05 < x < 0.20 is 0.17 \u00b1 0.06. This is to be compared with the threefold less precise value of 0.05 \u00b1 0.15 prior to the inclusion of the present STAR jet data. The value over the range x > 0.05 is 0.23 \u00b1 0.06 [34,35].",
