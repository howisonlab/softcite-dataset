Thus, the study of various conserved quantities on an event-by-event basis offers the possibility to study the phase transition and the nature of high density matter. The ALICE experiment is well suited for precise event-by-event measurements of various quantities. In this article, the event-by-event fluctuations of mean transverse momentum and net-charge distributions as measured by the ALICE experiment are presented.",

The central detectors cover the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 0.9, with good momentum measurement as well as good particle identification capabilities. This gives us an excellent opportunity to study the fluctuations and correlations of physical observables on an event-by-event basis. In this analysis, the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) 3) is used for selecting tracks, the Inner Tracking System (ITS) is used for vertexing and triggering and VZERO scintillator hodoscope is used for estimating centrality 4) as well as triggering. The present analysis is performed by taking the z-vertex within \u00b110 cm of the detector's center, |\u03b7| < 0.8 and the charged particle transverse momentum, p T , from 0.15 GeV/c to 2 GeV/c. \u00a72. Mean transverse momentum fluctuations Event-by-event fluctuations of mean transverse momentum, i.e. p T , contain information on the dynamics and correlations in heavy-ion collisions. The fluctuations in p T may be related to the critical behavior of the system in the vicinity of a phase boundary 5), 6) or the occurrence of thermalization and collectivity. 7) In general, there may be a variation of fluctuations (increase or decrease) in heavy-ion collisions with respect to the pp collisions which serves as the baseline measurement.",
