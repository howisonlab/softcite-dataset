            "text": "Measurements of dijet pT correlations in Pb+Pb and pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-ofmass energy of ^/sNN = 2.76 TeV are presented. The measurements are performed with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using Pb+Pb and pp data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 0.14 nb-1 and 4.0 pb-1, respectively. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-lq algorithm with radius parameter values R = 0.3 and R = 0.4. A background subtraction procedure is applied to correct the jets for the large underlying event present in Pb+Pb collisions. The leading and sub leading jet transverse momenta are denoted pT1 and pT2 . An unfolding procedure is applied to the two-dimensional (pT1, pT2) distributions to account for experimental effects in the measurement of both jets. Distributions of (1/N )dN/dxj, where Xj = pT2/pT1, are presented as a function of pT1 and collision centrality. The distributions are found to be similar in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions and pp collisions, but highly modified in central Pb+Pb collisions. Similar features are present in both the R = 0.3 and R = 0.4 results, indicating that the effects of the underlying event are properly accounted for in the measurement. The results are qualitatively consistent with expectations from partonic energy loss models.",

            "text": "Jets have long been considered an important tool for study ing the matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In these collisions, a hot medium of deconfined colour charges is produced, known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Jets pro duced in the initial stage of the collision lose energy as they propagate through the medium. This phenomenon, known as jet quenching, was first observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [1,2]. Early measurements using fully reconstructed jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC provided a direct observation of this phenomenon [3]. In Pb+Pb collisions the transverse momentum ( pT) balance between two jets was found to be distorted, resulting from configurations in which the two jets suffer different amounts of energy loss. This measurement was the experimental confirma tion of some of the initial pictures of jet quenching and signatures of a deconfined medium [4].",

Signifi cant theoretical advances also occurred in this period, and while a complete description of jet quenching is not available, some models are capable of reproducing its key features and provid ing testable predictions. Measurements of the dijet asymmetry, Aj = (pT1 -pT2)/(pT1 + pT2), where pT1 and pT2 are the transverse momenta of the jets with the highest and second highest pT in the event, respectively, have been crucial in facilitating these develop ments. The experimental results demonstrate that the measured asymmetries in central collisions, where the geometric overlap of the colliding nuclei is almost complete, differ from those in pp col lisions more than is expected from detector-specific experimental effects [3,9,10]. However, such effects, in particular the resolution of the measured jet pT, must be corrected for in order for the measurement to be directly compared to theoretical calculations. Unfolding procedures have been applied to correct for such effects for single-jet measurements [6]; however, the dijet result requires a two-dimensional unfolding to account for migration in the pT of each jet separately. The measurement reported here is the first unfolded Pb+Pb dijet measurement and as such can be directly compared to theoretical models.",

The (pT1, pT2) dis tributions are less strongly correlated for jets reconstructed with a smaller value of R due to the effects of parton radiation out side the jet cone, which makes them less suitable as a probe of medium-induced effects in Pb+Pb collisions. However, for smaller jet sizes the effect of the UE on the measurement is significantly reduced.

The minimum-bias trigger is defined by a logical OR of the TE trigger with a threshold of ETot = 50 GeV and the ZDC coin cidence trigger. The combined trigger is fully efficient in the range of centralities presented here. In the events selected by the ZDC coincidence trigger alone, at least one track is required to remove empty events. The jet trigger [18] first selects events satisfying the TE trigger with a threshold of ETot = 20 GeV. A jet reconstruction procedure is then applied using the anti-kt algorithm with R = 0.2 and utilising a UE subtraction procedure similar to that used in the offline reconstruction described in Section 4. Events with at least one jet with ET > 20 GeV at the electromagnetic scale [19] are se lected by the jet trigger. The use of R = 0.2 for jets in the trigger, as opposed to the values of R = 0.3 and 0.4 applied in the mea surement, is motivated by the need to define an algorithm that is robust against UE fluctuations, which grow with R. The effects of the different R values on the trigger efficiency are discussed in Section 5. The minimum-bias trigger operated with a prescale of approximately 18 while no prescale was applied to the jet trigger. After accounting for these prescales, the recorded events corre spond to integrated luminosities of 8 pb-1 and 0.14 nb-1 for the minimum-bias and jet-triggered samples, respectively.",

To fully populate the kinematic range considered in the measure ment, hard-scattering events are generated for separate intervals of pT, the transverse momentum of outgoing partons in the 2 2 hard-scattering, and combined using weights proportional to their respective cross sections. Separate samples are generated for the Pb+Pb and pp analyses, with the simulated detector conditions chosen to match those present during the recording of the re spective data samples. In the pp data sample, the contribution of additional collisions in the same bunch crossing (pile-up) is ac counted for by overlaying minimum-bias pp collisions produced at the same rate as in the data, generated by Pythia version 8.160 [27] using the A2 [28] tune with CT10 PDF set [29]. In the Pb+Pb sam ple, the UE contribution to the detector signal is accounted for by overlaying the simulated events with minimum-bias Pb+Pb data. The vertex position of each simulated event is selected to match the data event that is overlaid. Through this procedure the MC sample contains contributions from underlying-event fluctuations and harmonic flow that match those present in the data. The com bined signal is then reconstructed using the same procedure as is applied to the data. So-called truth jets are defined by applying the anti-kt algorithm with R = 0.3 and R = 0.4 to stable particles in the MC event generator's output, defined as those with a proper lifetime greater than 10 ps, but excluding muons and neutrinos, which do not leave significant energy deposits in the calorimeter.",

Thus combinatoric jet pairs, with out any underlying angular correlation, are expected to acquire a modulation to their A0 distribution determined by the dominant flow harmonics [33].

The response is typically characterised in terms of the jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy resolution (JER). These quantities describe the mean and width of the pTeco distributions at fixed pTruth, expressed as a frac tion of pTruth. Generally, the mean of pTeco differs from pTruth by less than a percent, independent of pTruth and centrality. This indi cates that the subtraction of the average UE contribution to the jet energy is under good experimental control. The JER receives contri butions both from the response of the calorimeter and from local UE fluctuations about the mean in the region of the jet. The latter contribution dominates at low pT with the resolution as large as 40% at pT ~ 30 GeV in the most central collisions. At the same pT, the JER is only 20% in peripheral collisions, similar to that in pp collisions.

Here 8prior is the uncertainty due to the choice of prior, obtained using the procedure described above. The statistical uncertainties are evaluated using a pseudo experiment technique. Stochastic variations of the data are gen erated based on its statistical uncertainty and each variation is unfolded and projected into xj. The statistical covariance of the set is taken as the statistical uncertainty. An additional covariance is obtained from applying the pseudo-experiment procedure to the response matrix and combined with that obtained from applying the procedure to the data. The 82tat for each xj bin is taken to be the diagonal element of the resulting covariance matrix. The statis tical covariance matrices exhibit similar trends across all pT1 and centrality ranges. Nearby xj bins show a strong positive correla tion that diminishes for bins separated in xj, and is expected from the effects of the procedures for unfolding and mapping to xj. Bins well separated in xj show an anti-correlation attributable to the normalisation of (1/N )dN/dxj. Fig. 4 shows VX82 as a function of niter along with its various contributions for the 100 < pT1 < 126 GeV range and 0-10% centrality interval. Since the unfolding is performed in two dimensions, the value of niter cannot be chosen separately for each range of pT1 .

The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the total VS82 for each range of pT1 considered in the measurement along with the total combined over all pT1 ranges. The value of niter for each centrality bin and R value is chosen by considering the niter de pendence of VX82 for each pT1 bin and selecting a value that maintains comparable uncertainties across all pT1 ranges. The more central bins require the most iterations, resulting from the larger jet energy resolution in these events. The number of iterations for R = 0.4 jets is at most 20 for 0-10% centrality and at the least 6 for 60-80% centrality.

The first accounts for differences between the detector operating conditions in the Pb+Pb and pp data, which were recorded in 2011 and 2013, respectively. This is derived by using charged-particle tracks reconstructed in the inner detector to provide an independent check on the JES, which only uses infor mation from the calorimeter. For each jet, all reconstructed tracks within AR < 0.4 and having pJj-rk > 2 GeV, are matched to the jet and the scalar sum of the track transverse momenta is evaluated. The ratio of this sum to the jet's pT is evaluated both in data and in the MC sample, and a double ratio of the two quantities is formed. The double ratio obtained in peripheral Pb+Pb data is compared with that in pp data. The precision of the comparison is limited by having too few events in the peripheral Pb+Pb data and at high jet pT, and a pT-and n-independent uncertainty of 1.46% is assigned to account for potential differences.",

Since the MC sample is constructed using the data overlay procedure, it is expected that the centrality depen dence of the JER should be well described in the MC sample. This is checked by studying the distribution of UE fluctuations using random, jet-sized groups of calorimeter towers in Pb+Pb data. The standard deviations of these distributions describe the typical UE contribution beneath a jet. The centrality dependence of the UE fluctuations is compared to that of the JER in the MC sample, and a systematic uncertainty is included to account for the observed differences.

Differ ences may arise between the data and MC sample from differences in the calorimetric response or because the jets in the two sam ples have different internal structure. The contribution of the latter is constrained by using existing jet shape measurements [37]. An uncertainty in the energy scale is applied to account for residual differences, which are 1.5% at the lowest pT and decrease sharply as a function of pT to a limiting value of 0.3% at high pT. A similar study comparing the variances of the pR=0.3 /pR=0.4 distributions is used to constrain the uncertainty in the relative resolution. This uncertainty is applied in the R = 0.3 jet measurement in the same fashion as the other JER uncertainties described above. Although larger than the centrality-dependent contribution, it is also much smaller than the centrality-independent contribution. As the response matrix is sparsely populated (containing 404 bins), statistical fluctuations could introduce instabilities in the unfolding. To evaluate the sensitivity to such effects, along with any other defects in the response, a new response matrix is con structed as a factorised product of single-jet response distributions, i.e. assuming the responses in pT1 and pT2 are independent. The data are unfolded using this new response and the differences be tween the unfolded distributions are taken as a systematic uncer tainty. Systematic uncertainties in the unfolding due to the choice of prior are estimated as described in the previous section and are also included. \u00a7l-\u015d 12 Fig. 6.

In the 0-10% centrality bin for 100 < pT1 < 126 GeV, the xj distri bution develops a significant peak at xj ~ 0.5 indicating that the most probable configuration for dijets is for them to be highly un balanced. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in the pp data where the most probable values are near xj ~ 1. The centrality dependent modifications evolve smoothly from central to periph eral collisions, and the results in the 60-80% centrality bin and the pp data are consistent. At larger values of pT1 the xj distributions are observed to narrow and the differences between the distribu tions in central Pb+Pb and pp collisions lessen. This is qualita tively consistent with a picture in which the fractional energy loss decreases with increasing jet pT. The features in the data are com patible with those observed in previous measurements of dijets in Pb+Pb collisions by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, however, the trends in this measurement are more prominent due to the application of the unfolding procedure. This result constitutes an important benchmark for theoretical models of jet quenching and the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

The parameters c3 and c4 are obtained by fitting the A^> distribution for jet pairs with |An| > 1 in the region 0 < A^ < y, which is indicated by the red squares (scaled to match the black circles in the yellow region for presentation purposes). The error bars denote statistical errors. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)",
