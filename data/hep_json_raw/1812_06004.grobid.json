Among these processes, the decays B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 and B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc have precise Standard Model (SM) predictions [1] given the absence of hadrons in the final state. 1 Due to helicity suppression, they are also highly sensitive to particles predicted in extensions of the SM such as charged scalars [2]. Measurements of the B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 decay from the B factories [3][4][5][6] lead to an average branching fraction of (1.4 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7] consistent with the SM prediction within the experimental uncertainty. An upper limit of 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 [8] is set on the B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc branching fraction at 90% confidence level.",

This problem is not present for the decay B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc , depicted in Fig. 1. The decay receives a contribution from the B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc \u03b3 * with \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 amplitude, where the annihilation to the \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc pair occurs through an intermediate B * meson. It also receives contributions from the B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc V amplitude, where V denotes a vector meson such as the \u03c9 or the \u03c1, that can decay to a pair of muons. With these contributions, nearly all decays have a muon pair with a mass below 1 GeV/c 2 . The only theoretical calculation available is based on vector-meson dominance and predicts that the corresponding branching fraction, B(B + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ), is around 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 [11].",

To best exploit the limited amount of data available for training, a ten-fold cross-validation method [30] is employed. The BDT contains information about kinematic and geometric properties of the B + candidate and associated muon tracks together with the total number of reconstructed tracks in the event. The most distinguishing properties between signal and combinatorial background candidates are the isolation of the decay vertex (as described in Ref.

The requirement on the BDT response is optimised by maximising the figure of merit [32] where \u03b5 S is the signal efficiency of the selection and n B refers to the estimated number of background candidates in the signal region. The optimal BDT working point is 40% efficient on simulated signal events while rejecting 99% of the combinatorial background.

The largest systematic uncertainty arises due to the choice of the shape for the combinatorial background. If the combinatorial background is allowed to have two components with different exponential slope, the upper limit on the branching fraction changes by 14.2%. While the fit does not improve from adding in an extra component, its existence cannot be excluded from the fit to the data. In simulation, the nominal signal model, as described in Sect. 2, creates a photon pole, increasing the branching fraction in the low dimuon mass region. The associated systematic uncertainty is estimated by replacing this decay with a model assuming a uniform phase-space distribution, but still with one of the muon pairs having a mass below 980 MeV/c 2 . This results in a 4.6% systematic uncertainty. Using the model from Ref. [11] results in a smaller variation.",
