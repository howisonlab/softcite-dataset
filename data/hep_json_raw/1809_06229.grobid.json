For example, the SM cannot account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry currently present in the Universe, it does not provide a Dark Matter candidate and it does not explain its own gauge group structure, the charge assignment of the fermions or the mass hierarchy between the different families. A more global theory that extends the SM at higher energies and shorter distances could provide an answer to some of these questions, which are at the core of modern particle physics.",

            "text": "Searches for signs of New Physics (NP) existing beyond the SM are performed in two ways. The first one looks for the direct production of new particles. The key ingredient for this so-called \"relativistic path\" is the amount of energy available in the collision, which drives the maximum mass range that can be probed. For this reason, the vast majority of the most stringent limits on the mass of NP particles have been obtained at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, as shown for example in Ref. [1]. The second method, the so-called \"quantum path\", exploits the presence of virtual states in the decays of SM particles. Due to quantum mechanics, these intermediate states can be much heavier than the initial and final particles, and can affect the rate of specific decay modes as well as their angular distributions. The most evident example is the \u03b2 decay of the neutron that probes physics at the W -boson scale. Flavour physics, which studies the properties of s-, c-and b-hadrons, has been extremely successful in providing information on the virtual particles involved in the processes examined. A famous example is the observation of CP violation in K decays [2] that could be interpreted as a sign of the existence of three quark families in the SM [3], several years before the discovery of the third generation [4,5]. Similarly, the first observation of the B 0 -B 0 mixing phenomenon [6] revealed that the t-quark mass was much larger than anticipated, eight years before its direct measurement [7,8]. The investigation of the effects induced by virtual particles on SM decays requires very large data samples, since (for a given coupling to NP) the larger the NP scale, the smaller the influence on the process. While the relativistic path probes the scale of potential NP contributions in a direct way through specific signatures, the quantum path provides constraints correlating the scale and the coupling to NP.",

Firstly, the fermion fields are organised in three generations with the same gauge charge assignments leading to the same structure of couplings in all three generations (universality). Secondly, the Higgs mechanism for the breakdown of the electroweak gauge symmetry does not affect the universality of the gauge couplings (including electromagnetism). Finally, the only difference between the three families comes from the Yukawa interaction between the Higgs field and the fermion fields. The diagonalisation of the mass matrices yields mixing matrices between weak and mass eigenstates occurring in the coupling of fermions to the weak gauge boson W \u00b1 , which are the only source of differences between the three generations: the CKM matrix, V , for the quarks and the PMNS matrix, U , for the leptons.",

            "text": "This last point is the key element to consider in order to design observables testing LU within the SM. For a given transition in the SM, quarks and leptons stand on a different footing. The flavour of the quarks involved in a transition can be determined experimentally (mass and charge of the fermions involved), so that the CKM matrix elements involved can be determined unambiguously for a given process. In the case of Flavour-Changing Charged-Current (FCCC) transitions like \"tree-level\" b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd decays ( Fig. 1), where represents any of the three charged leptons, a single CKM matrix element is involved (V cb ). In the case of Flavour-Changing Neutral-Current (FCNC) processes, like \"loop-level\" b \u2192 s + \u2212 decays (Fig. 2), the CKM matrix elements at play depend on the flavour of the quark running through the loop and have the form (V ib V * is ), where i = t, c, u. The unitarity of the CKM matrix and its hierarchical structure allow one to express all CKM products in terms of a leading term (V tb V * ts ) and a Cabibbo-suppressed contribution (V ub V * us ). For the lepton part, the charged leptons can be easily distinguished in the same way as quarks, whereas most of the time the neutrino mass eigenstates cannot be distinguished (their mass differences are negligible compared to the other scales and they are not detected in experiments). For example, considering the decay width of the FCCC transition b \u2192 c \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 leading to a final state with a \u03c4 lepton and an unspecified (anti)neutrino mass eigenstate, one has to sum over the amplitudes associated to the production of all the three possible (anti)neutrino mass eigenstates. The overlap of each mass eigenstate with the produced weak interaction eigenstate \u03bd \u03c4 is given by the PMNS matrix U , so that the decay width features a factor of the form i=1,2,3 |U \u03c4 i | 2 , which is equal to 1 due to the unitarity of the PMNS matrix in the SM. Therefore, the PMNS matrix plays no role in the SM, as well as in extensions featuring only three light neutrinos, and it is ignored in most computations. These characteristics explain why either purely leptonic or semileptonic processes that involve leptons of different generations, but with the same quark transition, are preferred to test LU, so that there are no PMNS matrix elements and the CKM ones can cancel out in ratios.",

The idea is akin to building the Fermi theory, which is valid for \u03b2 decays, starting from the electroweak theory: even though the latter has desirable features (e.g. renormalisability and ultraviolet completion), the former is adapted for low-energy transitions involving only light particles. The Fermi theory is obtained by neglecting the propagation of the W gauge boson, leading to a point-like four-fermion interaction. More generally, the effective theory valid at low energies, i.e. large distances, is constructed by ignoring the short-distance propagation of the massive (and/or energetic) degrees of freedom and conserving only the light (and/or soft) particles as dynamical degrees of freedom, propagating over long distances. The effects of the massive degrees of freedom are absorbed into short-distance coefficients multiplying the operators built from light fields. The effective Hamiltonian approach can be applied to both FCCC and FCNC, which are illustrated in the two cases of interest in the following. In the case of FCCC decays, such as b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd , this idea yields the effective Hamiltonian:",

Once again, due to the universality of lepton couplings for the three generations, the SM Wilson coefficients have the same value for all three lepton generations. Analysing the processes within this approach offers several advantages. The determination of the Wilson coefficients requires a matching to the high-energy theory (here, the SM) at the electroweak scale O(m t , M W ) and a running from this scale down to the low-energy scale \u00b5 b = O(m b ). The renormalisation group equations used then provide a re-summation of hard gluon exchanges generating large logarithms, which are then included in the Wilson coefficients [25][26][27] leading to an accurate determination of the Wilson coefficients at the low-energy scale. At the level of accuracy reached by such computations, electroweak corrections both in the SM and in NP scenarios can also be included and may prove important [27,28].",

This approach can be extended to NP operators, leading to products of different lepton tensors L and hadron matrix elements involving other quark bilinears.

These long-distance contributions are much more difficult to handle theoretically than form factors, due to their non-local nature (i.e., involving two operators at different space-time positions), even though theoretical estimates are available for some of these decays (see Sec. 8.1.2 for more detail). In particular, these contributions describe the decay through intermediate charmonium resonances such as B \u2192 K * \u03c8(\u2192 + \u2212 ). The lightest ones, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), provide very large peaked contributions, so that hadronic SM physics dominates q 2 regions close to the charmonium resonance masses. The corresponding regions (bins) of the dilepton invariant mass squared, q 2 , are thus generally not included in the analyses, unless one wants so learn information on the long-distance dynamics of these resonances. The higher charmonium states contribute less significantly, and their contributions appear as wiggles that tend to cancel each other when integrated over large q 2 bins, so that they are expected to yield an average close to the perturbative QCD result [31]. According to specific resonances models [32], this quark-hadron duality is expected to hold at a few percent level for the branching ratio of B \u2192 K + \u2212 decays, whereas the extension to other decay modes and observables remain to be investigated. It should be stressed that these additional non-local contributions occur for FCNC, since electromagnetic interactions can convert intermediate light cc or u\u016b pairs into a final pair of charged leptons, but they do not appear in the case of FCCC, where only form-factor contributions should be present and there are no resonant contributions (which could yield strong variations with q 2 ). Once again, these decay amplitudes can be analysed in the helicity amplitude formalism, leading to a set of angular observables describing the differential cross section for the decay [29,30,33].",

Depending on the energy q 2 released to form the lepton pair, the form factors can be estimated using different theoretical approaches: Light-Cone Sum Rules (LCSR) can be used for small q 2 (i.e. large recoil of the final-state hadron in the b-hadron rest frame) [34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41], and Lattice QCD simulations for large q 2 (small recoil) [42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]. In both regimes, a further expansion of the theory in powers of \u039b/m b (where \u039b corresponds to the typical scale of QCD of order 1 GeV) can be performed. The resulting effective field theories (respectively Soft-Collinear Effective Theory [50][51][52][53] and Heavy-Quark Effective Theory [54][55][56]) can be used to provide approximate relationships between the form factors and thus reduce the number of independent hadronic inputs needed. It should also be emphasised that most of these theoretical approaches treat the final state as a stable particle under the strong interaction, even though vector particles are unstable and with a finite width (in particular D * and K * ), which may require a specific assessment of the corresponding systematics.",

From a theoretical point of view, it is often beneficial to choose observables based on ratios, so that common hadronic form-factors cancel out in the numerator and the denominator: the hadronic uncertainties are decreased and rely on the theoretical evaluation of ratios of form factors, which are often better determined than absolute form factors. From an experimental point of view, the use of ratios is also advantageous since it alleviates the dependence on the absolute knowledge of efficiencies and thus reduces the size of the systematic uncertainties.",

            "text": "A particular interesting feature of b-hadrons is the large number of weak decay modes these can access, which is a consequence of the large b-quark mass. Therefore, in order to study decay modes with small branching fractions, the accelerators need to run at instantaneous luminosities in excess of 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and thus have large beam currents.  The two detectors roughly cover the full solid angle, however, because of the asymmetric beam energies, these are more instrumented in the direction of the high-energy beam and are offset relative to the average interaction point by a few tens of centimetres in the direction of the low-energy beam. Since most of the particles produced in B-meson decays have relatively low momentum, multiple scattering is the main source of inaccuracy in the momentum measurement. For this reason, both detectors (including the beam pipe) are characterised by a low-material budget. The vertex resolution is excellent (10 \u2212 20 \u00b5m), both along the beam direction and in the transverse plane. The reconstruction efficiencies for charged particles and photons, down to momenta of a few tens of MeV/c, is very high and the momentum resolution is very good over a wide spectrum to help separating signal from background. The detectors also have excellent particle identification (PID) capabilities (including K/\u03c0 separation for a momentum range between 0.6 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c) and allow the detection of photons down to an energy of 20 MeV, which permits an efficient bremsstrahlung recovery. Finally, the trigger systems are more than 99% efficient for events with BB pairs. In order to distinguish signal from background events, the B invariant mass reconstructed from the measured decay products is exploited. The experimental setup of the B-factories enables setting additional kinematic constraints that improve the knowledge of the B-meson momentum and allow for better discriminating signal from background. Since the \u03a5 (4S) resonance decays uniquely into a pair of B mesons, the energy of the B-decay products is equal to half of the CM energy. This enables defining two weakly correlated discriminating variables, \u2206E and m ES : the former compares the reconstructed B-meson energy to the beam energy in the CM frame; the latter, also known as the beam-energy substituted mass (BaBar), corresponds to the B-meson mass reconstructed from the measured momenta of the decay products and the beam energy (the equivalent variable at Belle is the beam-energy constraints mass, M bc ). The \u2206E resolution depends on the detector performance and varies a lot depending on the final state (e.g. for the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 this is about 29 MeV/c 2 [57]). The m ES resolution depends mainly on the accelerator energy spread and is of the order of 2 to 3 MeV/c 2 . The well-constrained kinematics of the BB pair is also extremely helpful to impose extra constraints to reconstruct final states with neutrinos.",

The detector performances are expected to be better than those of the BaBar and Belle experiments, most notably for the impact parameter and secondary vertex resolutions, K 0 S reconstruction efficiency and PID.  The main mechanism for bb production at the LHC is gluon-gluon fusion, where the two b-quarks are predominantly produced collinearly and close to the beam directions. This characteristics has strongly influenced the design of the LHCb detector [61], which is a single-arm forward spectrometer with a polar-angle coverage between 10 and 300 mrad in the horizontal plane and 250 mrad in the vertical one ( Fig. 8). At the LHC energies the bb cross section is very large, \u223c 295 \u00b5b at 7 TeV and increasing roughly linearly with the CM energy. This value is more than five orders of magnitude larger than the \u03a5 (4S) cross section (\u223c 1 nb), however, the ratio of the bb cross section to the total inelastic one is of the order of 1/4 at the \u03a5 (4S) CM energy and about 1/300 at the LHC for a CM energy of 7 TeV. As a consequence of this small ratio, the collection of interesting data requires the usage of a complex trigger system consisting of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Since the occupancy of the calorimeters is significantly higher than that of the muon stations, the constraints on the trigger rate require that higher thresholds should be imposed on the electron transverse energy than on the muon transverse momentum. The most noticeable effect on LU tests is the difference in the efficiencies of the electron and muon hardware triggers for the kinematics of interest. Another significant difference compared to the B-factories is the very large energy of the B decay products. Consequently, electrons emit a large amount of bremsstrahlung and a dedicated recovery procedure is in place in order to improve the momentum reconstruction. Despite this method, the B mass resolution is still degraded for final states involving electrons compared to final states including muons or charged hadrons, as illustrated in Fig. 9.",

At the B-factories, the J/\u03c8 invariant mass peak reconstructed using different lepton flavours is similar, as shown in Fig. 10. In particular, the event yields are similar indicating that the efficiency to reconstruct the two final states is comparable. Due to the combined effect of reduced bremsstrahlung and of a performant recovery algorithm, the dilepton invariant mass distribution for the e + e \u2212 final state only exhibits a slightly wider J/\u03c8 peak and a small radiative tail compared to the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state. On the contrary, the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 invariant mass reconstructed by LHCb when the J/\u03c8 is identified via its decay to two muons or two electrons manifests striking differences, as displayed in Fig. 9. Despite the bremsstrahlung recovery procedure, the electron final state features a long radiative tail and its yield is about five times smaller than that of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). The B + \u2192 K + J/\u03c8 (\u2192 + \u2212 ) decay mode can also provide interesting information to compare the B-factories and the LHCb experiment. The yield reported in Ref.

While this number is similar to the B + \u2192 K + J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) yield (88 \u00d7 10 3 ) reported in Ref.

In order to handle the very large backgrounds resulting from the partial reconstruction of these final states, diverse tools that exploit the extremely different experimental environments of the B-factories and of the LHC have been developed. In both cases, pure leptonic as well as hadronic decays of the \u03c4 are considered. At the B-factories, the missing information due to the undetected neutrinos is compensated by the full reconstruction of the other B meson in the event, since the only tracks present in the event are originating from the decays of the two B mesons produced by the \u03a5 (4S) decay. At the LHCb experiment instead, the additional information needed to constrain the final state is obtained from the precise reconstruction of the decay vertices involved, which, paired with the large boost due to the CM energy of the LHC, allow the measurement of the flight distance of the particles and provide enough information to compensate for the missing neutrinos. Despite the very different production rates and the stringent requirements that have to be applied in the more difficult LHC environment, the results reported in Sec. 6 indicate that the statistical precision is similar between the B-factories and the LHCb thanks to the dedicated techniques that have been developed. Moreover, the systematic uncertainties are typically of similar size as the statistical ones.",

The Belle experiment has split the data in two regions, below and above m 2 miss = 0.85 GeV 2 /c 4 , and performed a simultaneous fit to the two sub-samples [79]. In the low region, only the m 2 miss distribution is fitted, while in the high region, a two-dimensional fit is performed using the m 2 miss and the output of a neural network, optimised to suppress contributions from background events. The neural network includes m 2 miss , E * , kinematic variables and information from the calorimeter system. The projection of the fit results on m 2 miss for the BaBar analysis is shown in  D * 0 mesons. These decays, whose branching fractions are not well known, pollute the m 2 miss range between the peak at m 2 miss \u223c 0 and the signal region. The Belle experiment has also performed two additional measurements of R D * . The first one using semileptonic B-tag and leptonic \u03c4 decays [80], and the second with hadronic B-tag and 1-prong hadronic \u03c4 decays [81]. The latter includes also a measurement of the \u03c4 polarisation, P \u03c4 (D * ) = \u22120.38 \u00b1 0.51 +0.21 \u22120.16 . In order to tag semileptonic B decays, a D * + is combined with a light lepton. The cosine of the angle between the B 0 momentum and the D * + \u2212 in the \u03a5 (4S) rest frame, cos \u03b8 B\u2212D * , is then calculated under the hypothesis that only one massless particle is not reconstructed. The final sample is composed by a 5% (68%) of signal (normalisation) events, estimated from simulation. A neural network, O NB , is trained using simulated samples in order to separate the signal from the normalisation events. This neural network uses as input cos \u03b8 B\u2212D * , m 2 miss and the visible energy E vis = i E i , where E i is the energy of the ith particle in the \u03a5 (4S) rest frame. The ratio R D * is obtained from a two-dimensional extended maximum-likelihood fit to cos \u03b8 B\u2212D * and O NB . Three parameters are floating in the fit: the signal, the normalisation and the B \u2192 D * * \u2212 \u03bd components. The dominant systematic uncertainties are due to the limited statistics of the simulated samples and the knowledge of the B \u2192 D * * \u2212 \u03bd decays. The hadronic B-tag and 1-prong hadronic \u03c4 decay analysis includes semitauonic B decays with a D * \u2212 or a D * 0 in the final state. The separation of signal events from background sources is obtained through a fit to a single variable E ECL , the energy of the electromagnetic calorimeter clusters not associated to the reconstruction of the B-tag and the signal candidate. The signal is normalised with respect to the average of B \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03bd decays.

            "text": "[ps]  Using 3-prong hadronic \u03c4 decays the LHCb collaboration has also measured the ratio of branching fractions B [82,83]. From this measurement, R D * can be obtained using the B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 D * + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd \u00b5 branching fractions as external inputs [1]. Thanks to the use of the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 0 ) \u03bd \u03c4 decay, it is possible to exploit the \u03c4 decay vertex. The B 0 and \u03c4 momenta are estimated imposing constraints on the B 0 and \u03c4 masses, in order to reconstruct the \u03c4 decay time and q 2 = (p B \u2212 p D * \u2212 ) 2 . The dominant background due to inclusive B \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + (X) decays is highly suppressed by requiring the \u03c4 vertex to be significantly displaced from the B vertex. The remaining background is dominated by doubly-charmed B \u2192 D * \u2212 D(X) decays, where D represents a D + s , D 0 or D + meson. A boosted decision tree (BDT) is trained to suppress this background. The BDT includes information from the calorimeter system to suppress events where a photon or a \u03c0 0 are present, the invariant masses of oppositely charged pion pairs, the invariant mass of the D * \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + system and additional kinematic variables. After applying a requirement on the BDT, a three-dimensional fit to the BDT, the \u03c4 decay time and the q 2 variable is performed. The fit projections are shown in Fig. 13. The main systematic uncertainties are due to the limited size of the simulated samples and the knowledge of the doubly-charmed decays B \u2192 D * \u2212 D(X).",

The J/\u03c8 meson is reconstructed using the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state, which offers a clear trigger signature that helps compensating for the small B + c production. The B + c momentum is approximated in the same way as in the R D * measurement. The ratio R J/\u03c8 is obtained from a three-dimensional binned fit to m comb. bkg. from backgrounds due to B 0 and B + decays. The signal and background components are described by templates obtained from simulated events and validated with data. The fit projections are shown in Fig. 14. As for the other analyses, a significant part of the systematic uncertainty is due to the size of the simulation samples, but contrary to the R D * measurements, the systematic uncertainty due to the poor knowledge of the form factors involved in B + c semileptonic decays and its consequence on the shapes extracted from the simulation and used in the fit is also important.",

A combined analysis of B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B \u2192 K * e + e \u2212 decays, with both charged and neutral B meson decays, has been performed. Signal yields are extracted by fitting the beam-energy constrained mass, M bc (Fig. 17). The differential decay rate of these transitions can be described by three angles and q 2 . The coefficients that appear in the differential decay-rate expression can be combined to define new angular observables, P i [117][118][119], that are largely free of form-factor uncertainties. To take full advantage of the limited statistics, a folding technique that exploits the symmetries of the decay rate can be adopted, allowing the measurement of P 4 and P 5 . In order to test LU, the difference between such observables for the two leptonic modes, Q i [120], is determined. The analysis is performed in four independent bins of q 2 , as well as in an extended region that covers the range 1-6 GeV 2 /c 4 . Maximum likelihood fits to the angular distributions are performed to measure each observable in each bin q 2 . The data combines all charged and neutral decay channels, but is split between the muon and electron modes to test LU. The precision of the results is limited by the size of the data sample. The largest systematic uncertainty is due to the modelling of the efficiency. The distribution of the angular observables as a function of q 2 is shown in Fig. 18.",

The high bremsstrahlung rate for electrons due to the higher energies, and the low efficiency of the hardware trigger due to the high occupancy of the detector complicate the analysis procedure, in particular making it more difficult to separate signal from backgrounds. A dedicated bremsstrahlung recovery procedure is used to improve the electron momentum reconstruction, and signal candidates are classified depending on how many calorimeter clusters consistent with bremsstrahlung photons were recovered. However, the limited performances still degrade the resolution of the reconstructed invariant masses of both the dielectron pair and the B candidate (as shown in Fig. 19). In order to mitigate the signal loss due to the low efficiency of the calorimeter hardware trigger, decays with electrons in the final state are also selected through the hadron hardware trigger, using clusters associated with the decay products of the hadronic system, or by any hardware trigger from particles in the event that are not associated with the signal candidate. Several control samples identified on data are used to study the reconstruction performances (e.g. bremsstrahlung recovery, trigger and PID), in particular B \u2192 K ( * ) J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) decays, and ultimately the precision of the measurements is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the decays involving electrons. Both charged and neutral B decays are studied, but the hadronic system is only reconstructed using charged K and \u03c0 mesons to exploit the very good performances of the tracking and vertexing systems. Specific vetoes for peaking backgrounds are applied and the combinatorics is controlled using BDT or neural-network classifiers, while residual background due to decays where one or more of the products of the B decay are not reconstructed is modelled in the fit. The yields are extracted using one-dimensional fits to the reconstructed B mass, separately in trigger and bremsstrahlung categories (Fig. 20).",

Measurements have been performed as double ratios to the resonant B \u2192 K ( * ) J/\u03c8 (\u2192 + \u2212 ) modes to help mitigate the effect of significant differences in reconstruction performance between decays with muons or electrons in the final state. Due to the similarity between the reconstruction efficiencies of B \u2192 K ( * ) + \u2212 and resonant decay modes, many sources of systematic uncertainty are substantially reduced. The main residual experimental systematics are due to the modelling of the trigger response and description of the bremsstrahlung emission. The R K measurement has a relative precision of about 12%, while for R K * this amounts to about 17% in either q 2 bins. A summary of the R K ( * ) measurements is presented in Tab. 10 and in Fig. 21.   ",

In contrast with the tree-level case (\u03c4 lepton versus light leptons), the two leptons have light masses that can be neglected over most of the phase space, apart from the region of very small q 2 . Theoretical predictions in the SM for R K and R K * are extremely accurate [121,122] as hadronic uncertainties cancel to a large extent. R K needs only f + /f 0 for the m 2 /q 2 suppressed part of the branching fraction. R K * involves several helicity amplitudes with a large number of form factors, however, some of them are suppressed due to the V -A structure of the SM and the smallness of the lepton masses, leading to a good theoretical control of these quantities. Moreover, electromagnetic corrections have been estimated to be small and under control [110]. Some SM predictions are listed in Tab. 11. Finite-width effects and the underlying S-wave component of the K\u03c0 system were also discussed, with no indications of significant contributions [123][124][125].",

The BaBar and Belle measurements, which have a more limited precision, are found to be in agreement with the SM expectation. Significant deviations with respect to the SM predictions would indicate a violation of LU that cannot be due to hadronic effects, as these would impact in the same way b \u2192 s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and b \u2192 s e + e \u2212 transitions. Such effects, however, are particularly relevant in regard to the deviations observed in b \u2192 s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 alone, where there is an ongoing discussion concerning the size of hadronic effects (see Sec. 8.1.2). It is sometimes stated that R Hs observables have always limited hadronic uncertainties, but this statement must be modulated. More specifically, the hadronic uncertainties remain small as long as there are no significant LU-violating effects. If these are present, interferences between LU-violating and conserving contributions may spoil the cancellation of hadronic uncertainties. These effects might come from NP or from lepton-mass effects in the SM. The latter are only important at low q 2 , wherever m 2 /q 2 is not small compared to 1 (e.g. below q 2 \u223c 1 GeV 2 /c 4 ), and affect in particular the first measured bin in R K * . In this bin one thus expects larger theoretical uncertainties than in the region above 1 GeV 2 /c 4 , as well as at any value of q 2 in the presence of LU-violating NP [120,129].",

These deviations from LU observed in semileptonic b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd and b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions may not be explained within the SM and suggest a NP origin. This can be analysed either in a general Effective Field Theory approach or through specific NP models. The challenge does not consist only in explaining the deviations from LU observed in both decays, but also to reproduce other related measurements. More specifically, these NP explanations should reproduce the pattern of deviations observed in b \u2192 s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 observables, such as the branching fractions in B \u2192 K\u00b5 125,132,133] as well as the B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 angular observables [116,[134][135][136][137][138].

For the local part, form factors have been estimated in different kinematic regimes using several kinds of LCSR computations and lattice QCD simulations, with a good agreement and control over uncertainties [37,41,45,46,154], leading to a limited impact on the extraction of the Wilson coefficients [129,155,156]. For the non-local part, the contribution of charm loops can be taken into account at low-meson recoil relying on quark-hadron duality [32]. At large-meson recoil, one can use the available computations from LCSR [154,157], exploit these computations as an order-of-magnitude estimate, or take simpler estimates based on dimensional analysis. Another approach to assess these contributions consists in adding a general parametrisation with parameters fitted to the data. This has been implemented, for example, by adding to the decay amplitudes either polynomials in q 2 [158] fitted to branching fractions and angular observables, or polynomials in the conformal variable z(q 2 ) fitting not only b \u2192 s + \u2212 observables but also theoretical and experimental information on charmonia [159]. The charm-loop contribution obtained yield results for various observables in good agreement with the predictions obtained using the estimates in Refs. [154,157].",

The significance for the favoured NP scenarios considering only the LU observables R K and R K * (and excluding other b \u2192 s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 processes) is at the 3-4 \u03c3 level [126,127,153,158,160,161]. The violation of LU between muons and electrons is indeed significant, around 25% at the level of the C 9 coefficients. More specifically, the fit favours NP in the Wilson coefficients corresponding to left-handed quark currents: negative C N P 9\u00b5 and positive C N P 10\u00b5 decrease both B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 whereas positive C N P 9e and negative C N P 10e increase both B \u2192 Ke + e \u2212 and B \u2192 K * e + e \u2212 , and thus improving the agreement with the data. Moreover, good fits are obtained along the directions C N P 9 = \u2212C N P 10 , which arises naturally in models obeying SU (2) L invariance. A typical outcome of these global fits in terms of constraints on Wilson coefficients is shown in Fig. 23.",

In the EFT language, this photon contribution is described by the LU coefficients C 7,7 related to b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions, combined with the coupling of the photon to the lepton pair (which is LU in the SM and indeed measured as such to a very high accuracy, see for instance Sec. 3.4). LU-violating contributions could only come from other operators (like C 9 ), which are kinematically suppressed compared to the photon pole contribution. Therefore, NP contributions can improve the agreement with experiment slightly, but they would not be able to reproduce the central value currently measured for the R K * in this bin without contradicting measurements at higher q 2 (this is however not a problem within the current experimental uncertainties).",

Recent combined analyses [126,127,153,162] single out some NP scenarios preferred over the SM with a significance at the 5 \u03c3 level, consistently with earlier analyses that were mainly restricted to b \u2192 s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 processes [155,[163][164][165]. These scenarios agree with the ones presented above for fits restricted to LU observables. This is particularly the case where NP contributions enter only C 9\u00b5 and in both C 9\u00b5 and C 10\u00b5 , for which constraints can be extracted much more precisely than from the restricted set of LU observables. With this extended set of observables, there is still the possibility of adding NP also in electron Wilson coefficients, which however is not very much constrained, and suggests a much smaller NP coupling to electrons compared to muons. Scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor contributions are not favoured by the fits to the data [126,127,153,162].",

This approach ensures in particular that there is no significant lepton-flavour violation in FCNC such as b \u2192 s + 1 \u2212 2 with 1 = 2 (as could be expected in cases where no symmetries are invoked [178]).

The quantum numbers involved in b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd and b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes correspond to exchanges of two heavy colourless vector bosons (W , Z ), heavy colourless scalars (charged or neutral heavy Higgs-like bosons), or heavy coloured vector or scalar bosons (leptoquarks) [170]. In these simple models, both LU and lepton-violating effects are often generated together (for instance in leptoquark models), unless specific symmetries are imposed to prevent lepton-flavour violating couplings (for instance in Z models). In both cases, information on LU as well as lepton-flavour violation (such as B \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5\u03c4 [173]) provides interesting guides for model building, in conjunction with constraints from direct production at the LHC.",

            "text": "As the FCCC b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd transition occurs at tree level in the SM, NP explanations also occur typically at tree level. Various models with single mediators have been proposed, with heavy charged vector bosons (W ) [179][180][181][182], heavy charged scalars (H ) [183][184][185][186][187][188][189][190], or coloured vector or scalar bosons (leptoquarks) [145,176,177,[191][192][193][194][195][196][197][198][199][200][201][202][203][204]. A last possibility allowed by the quantum numbers of the fermions involved consists in vector-like quarks that mix with chiral SM quarks and change the couplings to the W boson (including right-handed couplings), but unless light right-handed neutrinos are introduced, they do not affect the couplings to the leptons and thus yield LU contributions which are not of interest here. Heavy vector and scalar bosons are disfavoured by the global fits (scalar) and by the direct LHC searches (vector) [151,179]. Leptoquark models provide a larger set of possibilities, with six different type of representations (lumping together representations differing only through hypercharge) [143,170,205]: three are scalar leptoquarks (S 1 , R 2 , S 3 ) and three are vector leptoquarks (U 1 , V 2 , U 3 ). All of them are triplets under SU C (3), but they have different representations under SU L (2): singlet (S 1 , U 1 ), doublet (R 2 , V 2 ) or triplet (S 3 , U 3 ). Two of them, S 1 and R 2 , are able to generate tensor contributions (correlated with scalar contributions). Leptoquark models are also bounded by high-p T constraints [151], but the bounds can be avoided by assuming large couplings to the second generation [176,206,207].",

This can be solved at the price of involving righthanded neutrinos [199]. Another possibility consists in combining the contributions from two different scalar leptoquarks. The combination of R 2 and S 3 provides a particularly good description of all available data at low and high energies generating both left-and right-handed currents. It features a complex scalar contribution to b \u2192 c \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 and can be embedded in a SU (5) Grand Unified Theory [222]. Another option consists in combining S 1 and S 3 , leading to solutions with only left-handed currents [170,206,223].",

However, such a massive vector leptoquark requires additional fields to build an ultraviolet complete model, for which several possibilities have been investigated further. For instance, models based on SU (4) Pati-Salam symmetry rely on partially unified gauge groups where the hypercharge and the colour charge are combined according to a single SU (4) gauge group. Stringent bounds coming from light-quark processes require different couplings of the leptoquark to the different generations, leading to the introduction of a Pati-Salam gauge group for each of the three generations [207,[224][225][226][227][228]. Another possible ultraviolet completion corresponds to composite models where an extended global symmetry group is broken spontaneously to give rise to the Higgs boson (as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson) as well as many other particles (Higgs doublets, leptoquarks, colourless and coloured vector bosons) [170,229]. Related models have been proposed, based on partial compositeness and feature heavy vector-like quarks and leptoquarks [202,223,[230][231][232][233].",

The measurements of the R D * ratio by the LHCb experiment have systematic uncertainties that are comparable to the statistical ones, and therefore the extrapolation to future sensitivities should take into account their evolution as well. The two main contributions to the systematic uncertainty are due to the modelling of the fit components and to the limited size of the simulated samples. The background modelling is estimated using dedicated control samples from data and larger datasets will improve its precision. However, in order to simulate larger statistics and reduce the associated uncertainties, challenging software developments are mandatory to speed up production times without affecting their accuracy.",

The Belle-II measurements are expected to be completely dominated by the statistical uncertainty. For LHCb, a linear dependence of the bb production cross section on the centre-of-mass energy and unchanged detector performances compared to Run1 are assumed. This is a conservative approximation since from 2021 the bottleneck of the hardware trigger level will be removed and efficiencies for channels with electrons and hadrons in the final state will increase significantly. However, the larger pile up in the Upgrade-I could increase the background contamination.",

As a consequence, a violation of LU would be an unambiguous sign of the existence of physics beyond the SM. This property has been tested throughout the years by using a variety of different probes: the production and the decay of electroweak gauge bosons, the decay of quarkonia, the leptonic and semileptonic decays of mesons with light quarks (including the c quark), however, no significant signs of deviations from the SM predictions have been observed.",

For these processes the SM predictions can be computed using an effective Hamiltonian approach that separates shortand long-distance contributions, and require non-perturbative inputs (e.g. form factors) obtained through diverse theoretical methods.",

Firstly, constraints on NP contributions to the short-distance Wilson coefficients of the Hamiltonian can be extracted from the experimental results using the effective Hamiltonian approach. Secondly, simple NP models that provide the desired short-distance contributions via the exchange of one or two mediators can be built without contradicting the limits on direct production or indirect contribution to low-energy processes. Finally, full-fledged NP models with a proper ultraviolet completion can be designed to match the previous models at lower energies.",

Both the Belle-II and LHCb experiments will be in an ideal position to provide additional information by significantly reducing the uncertainties on the LU observables already studied and by measuring new observables that will further constrain NP models. The present situation should thus evolve rapidly with the combined efforts of experimentalists and theorists, and has the potential to provide very exciting news in the coming years.",
