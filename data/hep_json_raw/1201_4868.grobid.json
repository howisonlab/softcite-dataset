In particular, the ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 neutral TGC vertices are are absent, whereas the WWZ and WW\u03b3 vertices are predicted non-zero. For this reason, the measurement of the di-boson final states at the LHC provides an important test of the SM: beyond Standard Model physics could contribute to the TGCs and result in modified diboson cross sections or final state kinematics. Furthermore, non-resonant di-boson productions are a background to the search for the Higgs boson, so it is essential to understand their detection sensitivity.",

In comparison with the WW analysis, the WZ analysis benefits from a three-lepton requirement which reduces most of the background. For that reason, and in order to increase the analysis acceptance, slightly looser lepton requirements are applied for the leptons making the Z candidate than for the one entering the W. After selection, a total of 71 events are observed in a sample of integrated luminosity L = 1.0 fb \u22121 . The total estimated background is of 10.5 +3.0 \u22122.2 events, composed of Z + jet and top events with a jet mis-identified as a lepton (estimated with a data-driven technique), and ZZ \u2192 llll (estimated from the MC).
