In the second phase (HERA-2) from 2003 to 2007, the positron and electron samples have increased by a factor of 2 and 10 respectively. In addition, spin rotators installed at the H1 and ZEUS interaction regions have provided longitudinal electron and positron polarization at HERA-2.",

Both H1 and ZEUS have performed their first search using the data of 1992 of less than 30 nb \u22121 [18]. Indeed, the HERA ep collider is an ideal machine to look for resonant production of new particles (LQs, squarks), which couple via Yukawa couplings directly to a lepton and a parton, up to the center of mass energy. 2 This is in contrast to the pair-production in e + e \u2212 at the LEP or in pp at the Tevatron collider, in which case the mass reach for a direct search is up to half of the center of mass energy. The search for the first generation LQs considers its decay into an electron and a quark or into a neutrino and a quark. These LQ decays lead to final states identical to DIS events. One cannot distinguish them on an event by event basis, but has to rely on different angular distributions, e.g. flat for scalar LQs and steeply falling for DIS events.",

The excess generated in a short period of time a huge number of speculations on possible new physics including resonant production of LQs or squarks. However, the later high statistics data samples collected by both experiments did not confirm the excess, and constraints on LQ production were derived. An example for the existing constraints using the full HERA data sample from H1 on a scalar LQ, which decays exclusively into an electron and a quark, is presented in Fig. 5  [20]. The new preliminary limit significantly improves the previous limit from HERA-1 [21]. For moderate Yukawa coupling values \u03bb of about 0.03 \u2212 0.6, it also extends well beyond the direct limit from the Tevatron [22] and the indirect limit from LEP [23].  Searches for LQs coupling to first and second generation fermions have also been performed [24]. In this case, the final state lepton is different from the incident electron (lepton flavor violating processes), and the searches are thus essentially background free.

In all topologies, the predicted event rate agrees with the number of observed events [30]. However, when a comparison is made requiring for the invariant mass of the two highest P T leptons M 12 > 100 GeV, an excess is observed in most of the topologies (Table 1), although the number of observed events remains statistically limited. Demanding P T > 100 GeV for the leptons, 5 (0) events are observed in the e + p (e \u2212 p) sample with 0.96 \u00b1 0.12 (0.64 \u00b1 0.09) expected.

The search looks for events with a singly produced H \u00b1\u00b1 decaying into a high mass pair of same charge leptons, one of them being an electron. No evidence for H \u00b1\u00b1 production is observed; out of the observed multi-lepton events from the HERA-1 data, only one di-electron event is compatible with the H \u00b1\u00b1 signature. Mass dependent upper limits are derived on the Yukawa coupling h el of the Higgs boson to an electron-lepton pair. Assuming that the doubly-charged Higgs decays only into an electron and a muon via a coupling of electromagnetic strength h e\u00b5 = \u221a 4\u03c0\u03b1 em = 0.3, a lower limit of 141 GeV on the H \u00b1\u00b1 mass is obtained at 95% CL. For a doubly-charged Higgs decaying only into an electron and a tau and a coupling h e\u03c4 = 0.3, masses below 112 GeV are ruled out.

Isolated lepton events at large missing P T Since the observation of the first isolated muon event with large P T by H1 in 1994 [34], searches have been pursued and extended by H1 and ZEUS to all three types of leptons and with increasingly larger data samples [35]. The results [36,37] 3 with the full HERA data are summarized in Table 2. H1 has observed an excess in both the e and the \u00b5 channel. The excess is, however, not confirmed by ZEUS. ZEUS has, on the other hand, observed 2 isolated \u03c4 lepton events with a hadronic final state (X) at large transverse momentum (P X T > 25 GeV) for 0.20 \u00b1 0.05 expected, based on the HERA-1 data, of which 49% is contributed by the SM signal events from single W production with a genuine isolated \u03c4 and missing transverse momentum in the final state.
