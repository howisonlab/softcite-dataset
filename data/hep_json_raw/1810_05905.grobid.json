The search uses the data set collected with the CMS detector in 2016, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The analysis considers three exclusive final states and uses reconstruction techniques that are optimized for top quarks with high Lorentz boosts, which requires the use of nonisolated leptons and jet substructure techniques. No significant excess of events relative to the expected yield from standard model processes is observed. Upper limits on the production cross section of heavy resonances decaying to a tt pair are calculated. Limits are derived for a leptophobic topcolor Z resonance with widths of 1, 10, and 30%, relative to the mass of the resonance, and exclude masses up to 3.80, 5.25, and 6.65 TeV, respectively. Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon in the Randall-Sundrum model are excluded up to 4.55 TeV. To date, these are the most stringent limits on tt resonances.",

Resonances decaying to tt pairs can be found in models that contain TeV scale color singlet Z bosons [3][4][5], a pseudoscalar Higgs boson that may couple strongly to tt pairs [6], axigluons [7][8][9], or colorons [10][11][12][13], and especially models that contain a leptophobic topcolor Z [14]. Additionally, extensions of the Randall-Sundrum model [15,16] with extra dimensions predict Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the gluons g KK [17] or gravitons G KK [18], which can have large branching fractions to tt pairs. This analysis searches for spin-1 resonances that do not interfere with SM tt production. Previous searches at the Fermilab Tevatron have excluded a leptophobic Z boson up to 900 GeV [19][20][21][22][23][24] at 95% confidence level (CL). Experiments at the CERN LHC have excluded various Z and g KK models at 95% CL in the 1-4 TeV mass range [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. The results presented here represent a significant improvement on the previous searches for tt resonances. This paper presents a model-independent search for tt resonances. Since no excess is seen, limits are calculated on several spin-1 resonance models of varying widths. The tt system, and all its daughter particles, decay as described by the SM. The top quark predominately decays to a W boson and a bottom quark (b). Each of the two W bosons in the event can decay to either a lepton and its corresponding neutrino or to hadrons. The analysis considers three subanalyses based on the decay modes of the two W bosons: dilepton, single-lepton, and fully hadronic decay modes of the tt system. In the fully hadronic channel, both W bosons decay to hadrons. In the single-lepton channel, one W boson decays to an electron (e) or muon (\u00b5) and its neutrino (\u03bd) counterpart, while the other W boson decays to hadrons. In the dilepton channel, both W bosons decay to an e or \u00b5 and a \u03bd. The leptonic selections are not optimized to identify electrons or muons originating from leptonically decaying tau leptons; however, such particles are not excluded by the event selections. The search is based on \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton (pp) collision data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .",

Because of the dijet topology of the search region, the largest reducible background arises from dijet events produced from quantum chromodynamic (QCD) interactions between the colliding protons. This background, referred to as QCD multijet production, can be reduced considerably by requiring one of the subjets in each of the two large radius jets, which are selected by the t tagging algorithm, to be consistent with the fragmentation of a bottom quark [33]. A subjet is defined as a smaller radius jet reconstructed within a larger radius jet. The use of subjet b tagging for categorization nearly eliminates the QCD multijet background leaving only the tt continuum in the highest sensitivity category.",

In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry. Muons are detected by four layers of gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet. The inner tracker measures charged-particle trajectories within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, and provides an impact parameter resolution of approximately 15 \u00b5m. A two-stage trigger system [34] selects pp collision events of interest for use in physics analyses.

Charged hadrons that are not associated with the PV in the event are excluded from the jet clustering procedure via charged hadron subtraction (CHS) [36]. All jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets are clustered using the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm [38] with a distance parameter of 0.4 (AK4 jets). If a lepton is found with \u2206R < 0.4 of an AK4 jet, its four-momentum is subtracted from that of the jet. The single-lepton and fully hadronic analyses also use anti-k T clustered jets with a distance parameter of 0.8 (AK8 jets). These larger-radius jets are used to tag the hadronic decay of top quarks. A highmass resonance decay creates daughter particles with significant Lorentz boost. The three jets from the top quark decay merge into a single-larger AK8 jet. Jets in all three channels are contaminated with neutral particles that are generated from additional pp collisions within the same or a neighboring bunch crossing (pileup). The extra energy in each jet is corrected based on the average expectation of the pileup within the jet footprint [43]. The expected energy offset due to pileup is modeled as a function of the number of primary vertices in the event [40]. Jets that are produced from the decay of charm and bottom quarks are identified using the combined secondary vertex algorithm (CSV) [44]. Loose, medium, and tight operating points are used in this analysis. They have a probability of 10, 1, and 0.1%, respectively, of misidentifying a light-parton jet as heavy flavor, where the light-flavor jet has p T > 30 GeV and is determined from a simulated multijet sample with a center-of-mass energy between 80 and 120 GeV [33]. They correspond to a b tagging efficiency of 81, 63, and 41%, respectively, for b jets (p T > 20 GeV) in simulated tt events. All jets are required to pass a minimal set of criteria to separate them from calorimeter noise and other sources of jets that do not originate from the PV [45]. Events are also required to pass a set of selections that remove spurious p miss T that is generated from calorimeter noise [46].",

[49], is applied to AK8 jets that use pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) corrections [50], referred to as PUPPI jets, in order to separate hadronically decaying top quarks from light quark or gluon jets. While CHS only removes charged particles originating from pileup, PUPPI corrects for both charged and neutral pileup particles. PUPPI jets, as opposed to CHS jets, are therefore used for t tagging because of their better performance as a function of pileup. The CMS t tagging algorithm only considers jets with p T > 400 GeV, as lower-momentum top quarks frequently decay into resolved jets. The algorithm iteratively reverses the jet clustering procedure in order to remove soft radiation. First, it reclusters the AK8 PUPPI jet with the Cambridge-Aachen jet clustering algorithm [51]. It then separates the jet (j) into two subjets, j 1 and j 2 , which must satisfy the \"soft drop\" (SD)",

If not, the lower-p T subjet is discarded and the declustering procedure continues with the higher-p T subjet.

For all samples, the pileup distributions are weighted to have an average of 23 pileup interactions per event, as measured in data. The same event reconstruction software is used for data and simulated events. Differences of a few percent in the resolution and reconstruction efficiency are corrected to match those measured in data using dedicated samples from data [75]. To remove contributions from low-mass resonances and Z/\u03b3(\u2192 )+jets production in events with same-flavor lepton pairs, the dilepton invariant mass is required to be above 20 GeV and outside of the Z boson mass window 76 to 106 GeV. Contamination from QCD multijet background is reduced by applying a two-dimensional (2D) selection for both leptons: \u2206R min ( , j) > 0.4 or p T,rel ( , j) > 15 GeV, where \u2206R min ( , j) is the minimum \u2206R-distance between the lepton candidate and any AK4 jet with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 3 and p T,rel ( , j) is the p T of the lepton with respect to the axis of the \u2206R-nearest AK4 jet. The 2D selection reduces the QCD multijet background by a factor of \u2248100. Events are further required to contain at least two AK4 jets with |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 100 and 50 GeV  for the leading and subleading jets, respectively. It is required that at least one of the two leading jets must be b tagged as determined by the loose CSV tagger operating point. Finally, p miss T is required to be larger than 30 GeV. The resulting sample is dominated by the irreducible tt background, which amounts to >90% of the total background. Figure 2 shows the distributions of \u2206R sum = \u2206R( 1 , j) + \u2206R( 2 , j) in \u00b5\u00b5, ee, and e\u00b5 subchannels, where \u2206R( 1 , j) and \u2206R( 2 , j) are the \u2206R variables between the leading and subleading lepton and the nearest jet. The lepton-jet pairs from Z boson decays are expected to be collimated and populate the low-\u2206R sum region.

The opposite \"probe\" jet is used to determine the t mistag rate. This rate is parametrized as a function of probe jet momentum (p) and is measured for each of the three subjet b-tag categories (figure 7). This \"anti-tag and probe\" procedure is repeated for the tt simulation, indicating that there is a small (\u22482%) contribution from SM tt events. The observed tt contamination is then subtracted from the anti-tag and probe data selection.",

The most constrained nuisance parameters are those associated with the tt renormalization and factorization scales as well as the top tagging efficiency, which are constrained to 8.5 and 9.2% of their prior uncertainty. The average nuisance parameter has a post-fit uncertainty that is 75% lower than its prior estimate. 1. Standard model cross sections.

For the g KK resonance hypothesis, the analysis excludes masses up to 4.55 TeV (4.45 TeV expected). These results represent a significant improvement on the previous results in this channel from the 2015 data taking period, not only because of the increase in integrated luminosity, but also the reduction in the uncertainty in the multijet background estimate in the fully hadronic channel, the improved W+jets rejection via the W+jets BDT in the single-lepton channel, and the inclusion of dilepton event categories in the combination. The absolute cross section limits are 10-40% better, for m tt above 2 TeV, than the previous result released by CMS [31] scaled to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .
