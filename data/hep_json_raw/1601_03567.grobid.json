A method utilising the production of \u03c4 leptons via W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays is used. This method is applied to the sample of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. No event is observed passing the selection criteria, and the observed (expected) upper limit on the \u03c4 lepton branching fraction into three muons, Br(\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc), is 3.76 \u00d7 10 \u22127",

            "text": "The observation of a lepton-flavour-violating (LFV) process involving charged leptons would be a major breakthrough in understanding the matter content of the universe and would support the hypothesis of leptogenesis [1]. In particular, LFV processes involving both a \u03c4 lepton and a muon are seen as most promising for such an observation, given the cure-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch rent measurements of neutrino oscillations [2]. In the Standard Model (SM), such processes have a vanishingly small branching fraction, e.g. Br(\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc) < 10 \u221214 [3], while a number of models beyond the SM predict it to be of the order of 10 \u221210 -10 \u22128 [4][5][6]. The current limits on branching fractions of neutrinoless \u03c4 lepton decays are of the order of few times 10 \u22128 [7][8][9][10], for Z boson LFV decays they are about 10 \u22125 [2,11,12], and for the LFV decay of a Higgs boson to a \u03c4 lepton and a muon they are about 1 % [13,14]. The main experimental obstacles to improve the sensitivity with \u03c4 leptons are the small number of produced \u03c4 leptons world-wide.",

            "text": "In this article, a search for neutrinoless \u03c4 lepton decays to three muons is performed with 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected with ATLAS detector in 2012 at 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy. The search is focused on a particular source of \u03c4 leptons, namely W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays with subsequent \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc decay. In such events, \u03c4 leptons are produced with a transverse momentum ( p T ) mostly in the range of \u223c25\u221250 GeV. Due to the relativistic boost of the \u03c4 lepton, the muons from the \u03c4 LFV decay are produced in close geometrical proximity to each other but isolated from other energetic particles in the event. The tau-neutrino from the W boson decay appears as missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) in the detector and together with the transverse momentum of the three muons ( p 3\u03bc T ) gives a transverse mass, m T = 2 p 3\u03bc T E miss T (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6), compatible with the W boson decay, where \u03c6 is the angle between the directions of the p 3\u03bc T and the E miss T . The unique signature in the detector is three muons with invariant mass equal to the mass of the \u03c4 lepton and with a significant missing transverse momentum that is on average back-to-back with the three muons in the transverse plane. Since no energetic jet is expected in the majority of W boson production events, very small hadronic activity is predicted beyond that from the soft underlying event or multiple simultaneous pp collisions (pile-up). A large fraction of such \u03c4 leptons decay sufficiently far from the W production vertex to give a fully reconstructable additional vertex. This allows the selection of three muons originating from a vertex which is displaced from the primary interaction vertex. The background events usually contain one or two muons originating from the decay of hadrons, including decays in flight, while the remaining tracks are hadrons mis-measured as muons, originating from e.g. a pile-up jet or a pion punching through the calorimeter. The dominant background is due to muons originating from decays of bor c-hadrons (heavy flavour, HF). Although such decays are typically accompanied by jets of particles produced in the direction opposite to the HF jets, in a fraction of the events the associated jet is lost or mis-measured, mimicking the signal E miss T . A small light-flavour multi-jet contribution is also present while the contribution from leptonic decays of vector bosons is negligible.",

A loose event selection is applied to collect a high-quality sample of candidate events satisfying |m 3\u03bc \u2212 m \u03c4 | 1 GeV. The characteristics of the loose sample of events are then analysed with a boosted decision tree (BDT). The BDT input variables are chosen so that the BDT output and the three-muon mass are uncorrelated in the mass range used in the analysis. A tight selection, following an initial cut on the BDT output, is applied to separate the signal from the background. After the optimal cut on the BDT output is found, a search is performed for an excess of events at the \u03c4 lepton mass above the expected background level.",

These are six multi-muon triggers and one dimuon plus E miss T trigger. The software-based trigger thresholds used for the muons range from 4 to 18 GeV in transverse momentum while the E miss T threshold is 30 GeV. The trigger efficiency for simulated signal events within the muon-trigger acceptance (three generator-level muons with p T > 2.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4) is \u223c31 % for the combination of all triggers used in the analysis. To evaluate the trigger performance in the region where the muons have a small angular separation, as is typical for the signal, a tag-and-probe study is performed using data events containing high-momentum J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidates. For this study, the data are collected using a single-muon baseline trigger with a p T threshold of 18 GeV. Single-muon efficiencies are measured separately for the different thresholds which define the six multi-muon triggers. Each multi-muon trigger efficiency is calculated as the product of the singlemuon efficiencies. Correction factors are applied to account for the limited performance of the trigger system in identifying a pair of muons as two muon-trigger objects. At small angular separations ( R 0.2), where most of the signal is expected and where these limitations are most pronounced, these corrections must be taken into account. These factors are measured from the efficiency to identify two independent muon-trigger objects for different R values between the tag-and the probe-muon. The total efficiency of the seven triggers is calculated considering correlations between any of the triggers. The trigger efficiency, measured from the data, is compared to the one measured in simulated J/\u03c8 events for the seven different triggers separately and jointly. Agreement between data and MC simulation was found to be within 11 % for all relevant values of R and p T , where the largest difference comes from events where the R separation is smallest. The systematic uncertainty on A s \u00d7 s due to the trigger is therefore taken to be 11 %.",

While the trigger efficiency is measured with respect to muon reconstruction as the baseline, the reconstruction efficiency is measured with respect to ID tracking, which in turn is close to 100 % efficient [22]. Small deviations from the assumed value for ID tracking efficiency have a negligible impact on this measurement. The tag-and-probe procedure is performed using muons as tags and ID tracks as probes. The baseline sample for the reconstruction efficiency measurement includes a large number of non-muon tracks, which must be subtracted. This is done in bins of probe-track p T ( p trk T ) and bins of the angular separation between the tagmuon and the probe-track, R \u03bc+trk . To describe the J/\u03c8 peak and the background, a small range in tag-muon plus probe-track invariant mass, m \u03bc+trk \u2208 [2600, 3500] MeV, is fit to a double Gaussian function plus an exponential function and a second-order polynomial. In each p trk T or R \u03bc+trk bin, the ratio of the J/\u03c8 peak component integral to the full shape (J/\u03c8 plus background) integral is used as a weight to correct the p trk T or R \u03bc+trk shape itself. This is done separately for the probe-track distributions (denominators) and the muonmatched probe-track distributions (numerators). The ratio of the above two weighted distributions is defined as the reconstruction efficiency per p trk T or R \u03bc+trk bin. The efficiency measured with this approach in data is compared with the one from simulation and the difference at small R \u03bc+trk results in an uncertainty of 13.1 % per event.",

These muons are required to originate from a common vertex. Second, a loose selection is applied to this sample to obtain a background sample that can be used to train the BDT, which is constructed using the TMVA toolkit [23]. The loose selection cuts (using a number of vertex quantities as well as kinematic quantities) are chosen to obtain a large background sample for training, while rejecting background that is kinematically inconsistent with the signal. Before training the BDT, the data events are divided into three regions based on the three-muon mass value. These are the blinded region (which includes the signal region), a sideband region and a BDT training region as defined in Table 1. Third, a tight selection (tightening the loose selection with a few additional cuts) is applied while simultaneously placing an initial loose cut on the BDT score, denoted by x>x 0 . The x>x 0 cut removes background-like events having a very low BDT score, while the tight selection further reduces the background in the blinded and sideband regions. Fourth, the background rejection as a function of the BDT cut is studied using data events in the sideband region passing the tight+x>x 0 selection. This allows to optimise the final cut on the BDT score, denoted by x>x 1 . The statistical analysis is performed for the tight+x>x 1 selection. The signal region (SR) is defined as an interval around the \u03c4 lepton mass with a half-width corresponding to twice the resolution of the three-muon mass, \u03c3 s = 32 MeV, as obtained from the signal MC sample. The analysis was blinded in a slightly wider region to allow variation of the signal region definition. The signal MC sample is divided into two independent samples. One signal sample is used for the BDT training while the second signal sample is used for estimating the A s \u00d7 s . The background in the signal region is estimated from a fit to the three-muon mass distribution in the sidebands (SB) using the tight+x>x 0 selection. This estimate is then scaled down to the final BDT score cut, x 1 , using a fit to the BDT shape as explained below.",

No events are observed in the signal region for the final selection while 0.193\u00b10.131 syst \u00b10.037 stat background events are expected.

Although this limit is not yet competitive with searches performed at B-factories [7,8] and at LHCb [9], it demonstrates the potential of LHC data collected by ATLAS as a probe of lepton flavour violation in \u03c4 lepton decays. This analysis utilises single \u03c4 lepton production in an environment very different from B-factories, which rely on \u03c4 lepton pair production in e + e \u2212 collisions. The method and sample presented here were used to improve the ATLAS muon trigger and reconstruction of lowp T , collimated muons relevant to the \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc search. The analysis is limited by the number of W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays and by the systematic uncertainty, which depends on the size of the data sample. With the much larger data sets anticipated at Run 2 of the LHC, the sensitivity of ATLAS to lepton-flavour-violating decays will be improved significantly.",

The solid grey area shows the signal shape (obtained from MC simulation), normalised to the area of the data for the tight+x>x 0 selection. For illustration, the signal is not constrained to the SRations. The dominant uncertainty component is the impact on R(x 1 ) of varying the sideband ranges definition. The differences from the nominal values of R(x 1 ) and N b (x 0 ) are summed in quadrature and are translated to uncertainties in N b (x 1 ). The systematic uncertainty associated with the",
