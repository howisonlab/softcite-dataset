            "text": "We previously performed a study of A FB for \u039b and\u039b production [1], where A FB is defined as the relative excess of \u039b (\u039b) baryons produced with longitudinal momentum p z in the p (p) direction. These results are in agreement with the observations in a wide range of proton collision experiments that the\u039b/\u039b production ratio follows a universal function of the \"rapidity loss\" y p \u2212 y between the beam proton and the produced\u039b or \u039b baryon which does not depend significantly on \u221a s or on the nature of the target p,p, Be, or Pb (see Ref. [1] and references therein). These results support the view that a strange quark produced directly in the hard scattering of pointlike partons, or indirectly in the subsequent showering, can coalesce with a diquark remnant of the beam particle to produce a \u039b baryon with a probability that increases as the rapidity difference between the incoming proton and outgoing \u039b baryon decreases. If this hypothesis is correct, we also expect A FB > 0 for \u039b c (\u039b c ), and \u039b b (\u039b b ) production in which a c or b quark can coalesce with a diquark form the proton. For the B mesons and \u039e and \u2126 baryons, we expect A F B \u2248 0 since these particles do not share a diquark with the proton. Previous D0 measurements include A FB (B \u2212 , B + ) [2] and A FB (\u039b b ,\u039b b ) [3].",

The collision region is surrounded by a central tracking system that comprises a silicon microstrip vertex detector and a central fiber tracker, both located within a 1.9 T superconducting solenoidal magnet [4], surrounded successively by the liquid-argon/uranium calorimeters, a layer of the muon system [5], comprising drift chambers and scintillation trigger counters, the 1.8 T magnetized iron toroids, and two additional muon detector layers after the toroids. The longitudinal momentum p z and the rapidity y \u2261 ln [(E + p z )/(E \u2212 p z )]/2 are both measured with respect to the proton beam direction in the pp center of mass frame where E is the energy of the baryon. We present results for the full integrated luminosity of 10.4 fb \u22121 , collected from 2002 to 2011, using two data sets (i) pp \u2192 \u039e \u2213 X, and (ii) pp \u2192 \u00b5\u039e \u2213 X. The first data set is unbiased since it is collected using a pre-scaled trigger on beam crossing (\"zero bias events\") or with a pre-scaled trigger on energy deposited in the forward counters (\"minimum bias events\"). The second data set is selected with a suite of single muon triggers which implies that most events contain heavy-quark (b or c) decays. This data set is defined using the same muon triggers and muon selections as in Ref. [8,9]. The muon data provides a sizable data set that adds additional statistics for the analysis. For \u2126's there are fewer events, so we only present results for the set pp \u2192 \u00b5\u2126 \u2213 X.",

            "text": "The polarities of the solenoid and toroid magnets were reversed about once every two weeks during data-taking to collect approximately the same number of events for each of the four solenoid-toroid polarity combinations. We apply weights to equalize the sums of \u039e \u2212 and \u039e + candidates reconstructed for each of the four polarity combinations. This averaging over magnet polarities cancels contributions from the detector geometry to A \u2032 FB and A \u2032 \u039e , but not to A \u2032 NS [1].  The raw asymmetry A \u2032 FB has negligible contributions from detector effects after averaging over solenoid and toroid magnet polarities. The raw asymmetries A \u2032 NS and A \u2032 \u039e are dominated by detector effects [1]. The quadratic term A \u2032 NS A \u2032 \u039e in Eq. (3) corrects A \u2032 FB for the detector effects A \u2032 NS and A \u2032 \u039e on the particle counts N F (\u039e \u2213 ) and N B (\u039e \u2213 ). We can therefore set A \u2032 FB = A FB where A FB is defined in Eq. (1).",

Charged particles with transverse momentum in the range 1.5 < p T < 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.2 are considered as muon candidates. Muon candidates are further selected by matching central tracks with a segment reconstructed in the muon system and by applying tight quality requirements aimed at reducing false matching and background from cosmic rays and beam halo. To ensure that the muon candidate traverses the detector, including all three layers of the muon system, we require either p T > 4.2 GeV or |p z | > 5.4 GeV [8,9]. The inclusive muon sample contains 2.2 \u00d7 10 9 reconstructed muons and 7.7 \u00d7 10 4 reconstructed \u039e \u2212 and \u039e + candidates with p T > 2 GeV, as well as 1.4 \u00d7 10 4 reconstructed \u2126 \u2212 and \u2126 + candidates.",
