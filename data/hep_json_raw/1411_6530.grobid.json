The experimental signature is a distinctive topology of a pair of jets, originating at a secondary vertex. Events were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.5 fb \u22121 . No significant excess is observed above standard model expectations. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of a heavy neutral scalar particle, H, in the mass range of 200 to 1000 GeV, decaying promptly into a pair of long-lived neutral X particles in the mass range of 50 to 350 GeV, each in turn decaying into a quark-antiquark pair. For X with mean proper decay lengths of 0.4 to 200 cm, the upper limits are typically 0.5-200 fb. The results are also interpreted in the context of an R-parity-violating supersymmetric model with long-lived neutralinos decaying into a quark-antiquark pair and a muon. For pair production of squarks that promptly decay to neutralinos with mean proper decay lengths of 2-40 cm, the upper limits on the cross section are typically 0.5-3 fb. The above limits are the most stringent on these channels to date.",

We therefore search for events containing a pair of jets originating from a common secondary vertex that lies within the volume of the CMS tracker and is significantly displaced from the colliding beams. This topological signature has the potential to provide clear evidence for physics beyond the standard model (SM).",

In the first model, a long-lived, scalar, neutral exotic particle, X, decays to qq. It is pair-produced in the decay of a non-SM Higgs boson (i.e. H \u2192 2X, X \u2192 qq [5]), where the H boson is produced through gluon-gluon fusion. In the second model, the long-lived particle is a neutralino\u03c7 0 1 , which decays into two quarks and a muon through an R-parity violating coupling. The neutralinos are produced in events containing a pair of squarks, where an squark can decay via the processq \u2192 q\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 qq 0q00 \u03bc [2]. Both models predict up to two displaced dijet vertices per event within the volume of the CMS tracker. The event selection is optimized for best sensitivity to the H model. The same event selection is then applied to the neutralino model to yield an additional interpretation of the search result.",

In the central region in pseudorapidity (\u03b7), the pixel tracker consists of three coaxial barrel layers at radii between 4.4 and 10.2 cm and the strip tracker consists of ten coaxial barrel layers extending outwards to a radius of 110 cm. Both detectors are completed by endcaps at either end of the barrel. Each endcap consists of two disks in the pixel tracker, and three small and nine large disks in the strip tracker. Together they extend the acceptance of the tracker up to j\u03b7j < 2.5. The pixel tracker provides threedimensional hit position measurements. The strip tracker layers measure hit position in r\u03d5 in the barrel, or z\u03d5 in the endcaps. A subset of strip tracker layers carry a second strip detector module, mounted back to back to the first module and rotated by a stereo angle of 100 mrad, which provides a measurement of the third coordinate (z in the barrel, r in the endcaps). The initial track candidates (track seeds) are formed using only those layers that provide threedimensional hit positions (pixel layers or strip layers with a stereo module). The outermost stereo layer in the barrel region is located at a radius of 50 cm. The track reconstruction algorithm can therefore reconstruct displaced tracks from particles decaying up to radii of \u223c50 cm from the beam line. The performance of the track reconstruction algorithms has been studied in simulation and with data [15].",

We use several combinations of squark and neutralino masses: \u00f0mq; m~\u03c70 1 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0350; 150\u00de, (700,150), (700,500), (1000,150), (1000,500), (1500,150), and (1500,500) GeV. The R-parity violating coupling \u03bb 0 211 [2] is set to a nonzero value and enables the decay of the\u03c7 0 1 into a muon, an up quark, and a down quark. The values of \u03bb 0 211 are chosen to give a mean transverse decay length of approximately 20 cm.",

The vertex fitting procedure down-weights tracks that seem inconsistent with the fitted vertex position, based on their \u03c7 2 contribution to the vertex. To include a track in the vertex, its weight is required to be at least 50%. This procedure reduces the bias caused by tracks incorrectly assigned to the vertex, e.g. tracks originating from pileup interactions. The secondary vertex fit is required to have a \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom less than 5. The distance in the transverse plane between the secondary and the primary vertices, L xy , must be at least eight times larger than its uncertainty. We require that the secondary vertex includes at least one track from each of the two jets. This requirement greatly reduces the background contribution from vertices due to nuclear interaction in the tracker material. The nuclear interaction vertices are characterized by low invariant mass of the outgoing tracks, making it unlikely that the outgoing tracks are associated with two distinct jets. The invariant mass formed from all tracks associated with the vertex, assuming the pion mass for each track, must be larger than 4 GeVand the magnitude of the vector p T sum of all tracks must be larger than 8 GeV. Vertices can be misreconstructed when displaced tracks originating from different physical vertices accidentally cross. To suppress such vertices, for each of the vertex tracks we count the number of missing tracker measurements along the trajectory starting from the secondary vertex position until the first measurement is found. We require that the number of missing measurements per track, averaged over all the tracks associated with the displaced vertex, is less than 2.",

The probability density functions p S\u00f0B\u00de;i are obtained using normalized signal and background MC distributions of dijet candidates passing the preselection. Because of the limited number of events in the background MC samples, we select the MC events with a looser trigger than the signal trigger, only requiring H T > 300 GeV with no additional requirement of a displaced dijet candidate. The same loose trigger was in operation during data collection. However, only a fraction of the events passing the trigger was recorded, so that the effective integrated luminosity for this data sample amounts to 17 pb \u22121 . Figure 2 presents the distributions of all four variables entering the likelihood discriminant for data, SM background MC simulation, and signal MC samples. The signal model distributions are found to have little dependence on the input masses and lifetimes, and therefore all the signal samples are merged in creating the p S;i functions. The three selection criteria (number of prompt tracks and prompt track energy fraction of jet 1, number of prompt tracks and prompt track energy fraction of jet 2, and vertex/ cluster discriminant) classify the events into eight regions. As listed in Table I, the events in the A region fail all three criteria, events in the B, C, D regions fail two of them and pass one, events in the E, F, G regions fail one and pass two other criteria, and events in the signal region H pass all the criteria. As the selection criteria are mutually independent in background discrimination, the background level in the signal region H can be estimated using different products of event counts in the other regions, namely FG/B, EG/C, EF/D, DG/A, BE/A, CF/A and BCD=A 2 . We use BCD=A 2 for the background prediction because it yields the smallest statistical uncertainty. If the selection criteria are perfectly independent, all of the above products predict statistically consistent amounts of background. However, the spread of the background predictions may be larger due to systematic effects (e.g. residual interdependence of the variables). We therefore assign the largest difference between BCD=A 2 and the other six products as a conservative systematic uncertainty in the background prediction.",

The K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decay provides an abundant source of displaced tracks owing to the K 0 S mean proper decay length of 2.68 cm [28]. The reconstruction of a K 0 S candidate depends upon the reconstruction of the two pions. Therefore it is proportional to the square of the efficiency for finding displaced tracks. Approximately 250 000 K 0 S candidates are obtained from a data sample collected with a multijet trigger. K 0 S candidates from simulation are obtained using QCD multijet samples. The MC simulation does not reproduce perfectly either the overall production rate for K 0 S , or their kinematic distributions [29]. In order to account for these differences, we first select K 0 S candidates with transverse decay lengths L xy < 2 cm, where tracking efficiency is high and well simulated. We then match the p T and \u03b7 distributions for these candidates and obtain weights, binned in p T and \u03b7, as well as an overall scale factor, that are applied to all K 0 S candidates. Figure 4 presents the decay length distributions of the K 0 S candidates in data and simulation after this reweighting. Data and simulation agree within 10% in the  entire range of the tracker acceptance. Therefore, we estimate the tracking efficiency systematic uncertainty to be 5%. We study the track finding systematic uncertainty by removing 5% of tracks before dijet reconstruction and selection. For all signal models, the signal reconstruction efficiency is lowered by at most 4%.",

Data and simulated events are selected using a trigger that requires H T > 300 GeV. The simulated signal and SM background distributions are scaled to an integrated luminosity of 17 pb \u22121 . For purposes of illustration, the signal process H \u2192 2X \u2192 2qq is assigned a 10 \u03bcb cross section for each mass pair. The differences between the mass pairs arise mainly from differences in the kinematic acceptance. Error bars and bands shown for the data, simulated SM background, and data/SM background ratio distributions, correspond to statistical uncertainties. The data/SM ratio histograms are shown with neighboring bins merged, until the relative statistical uncertainty is less than 25%. The last bin in each histogram is an overflow bin.",
