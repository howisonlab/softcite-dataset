The search is performed by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess of events above the expectation from the standard model background is found. The results are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model in which the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. An upper limit is set on the product of the cross section for associated Higgs and Z boson production and the branching fraction for such a Higgs boson decay, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. For a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the standard model production cross section, this corresponds to an observed (expected) upper limit on this branching fraction of 4.6 (3.6)% at 95% confidence level. These are the first limits on Higgs boson decays to final states that include an undetected massless dark photon.",

The observation of a sizable branching fraction of the Higgs boson to invisible or almost invisible final states [4][5][6][7] would be a strong sign of physics beyond the standard model (BSM). Studies of the new boson at a mass of about 125 GeV [8,9] show no significant deviation from the standard model (SM) Higgs boson hypothesis, and measurements of its couplings constrain its partial decay width to undetected decay modes [10,11]. Assuming that the couplings of the Higgs boson to W and Z bosons are smaller than the SM values, an upper limit of 38% has been obtained at 95% confidence level (CL) on the branching fraction of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to BSM particles [11].",

Several BSM models predict Higgs boson decays to undetected particles and photons [7,12,13]. In this search, the target final state is Z(\u2192 )H(\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 D ), where = e, \u00b5, and \u03b3 D is a massless dark photon that couples to the Higgs boson through a charged dark sector [14][15][16][17], and is undetected in the CMS detector. The branching fraction to such an invisible particle and a photon, B(H \u2192 invisible + \u03b3), can be as large as 5%, and be consistent with all model parameters and current LHC constraints [15]. A Feynman diagram for such a process is shown in figure 1. While the main focus is the case where the production cross section (\u03c3 ZH ) is assumed to be the same as that for the SM-like Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, the same analysis is also used to search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons with masses between 125 and 300 GeV, since similar decays are also possible for potential non-SM scalar bosons.",

Jets are calibrated in the simulation, and separately in data, accounting for energy deposits of neutral particles from pileup and any nonlinear detector response [42]. Jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.7 are considered in the analysis. The effect of pileup is mitigated through a charged-hadron subtraction technique, which removes the energy of charged hadrons not originating from the primary interaction vertex (PV) [43]. The PV is defined as the vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T . Here, the physics objects are the jets clustered using the jet finding algorithm [41,44] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector p T sum of those jets.",

For each individual bin, a Poissonian likelihood term is used to describe the fluctuation of the yields around the expected central value, which is given by the sum of the contributions from signal and background processes. The uncertainties affect the overall normalizations of the signal and background yields, as well as the shapes of the predictions across the distributions of the observables. Correlations between systematic uncertainties in different categories are taken into account. Uncertainties that purely affect the normalization within a category are incorporated as nuisance parameters with log-normal priors, while those associated with changes in shapes are assigned probability density functions described by a polynomial interpolation with a Gaussian constraint. The total likelihood is defined as the product of the likelihoods of the individual bins and the probability density functions for the nuisance parameters, including the product of the likelihood for the individual years. In summary, the maximum-likelihood fit function, L, can be written as: 1) where i runs over the three data-taking periods, j runs over the m T bins, k runs over the two |\u03b7 \u03b3 | values, P(N | \u03bb) is the Poisson probability, \u03b8 are nuisance parameters for the systematic uncertainties, and\u03b8 are their default values.

These scale factors are determined using Z \u2192 events in the Z boson peak region that were recorded with unbiased triggers [47,48]. The scale factors depend on the p T and \u03b7 of the lepton, and are within 2% of unity for both electrons and muons. The uncertainty in the determination of the trigger efficiency leads to an uncertainty smaller than 1% in the expected signal yield. The lepton momentum scale uncertainty is computed by varying the momenta of the leptons in simulation by their uncertainties, and repeating the analysis selection. The resulting yield uncertainties are \u22481% for both electrons and muons. The above procedure is applied also to determine the scale factors for photons, and the yield uncertainty for photon candidates is \u22481.5%. These uncertainties are treated as correlated across the three data sets.",

The uncertainty in the jet energy scale is 2-5%, depending on p T and \u03b7 [42], and the impact on the expected signal and background yields is about 3%. In this analysis, b tagging is used to reject events with genuine b quark jets in the final state, since signal events have no b quarks to first order in the decay channel of interest. The b tagging efficiency in the simulation is corrected using scale factors determined from data [45]. These values are estimated separately for correctly and incorrectly identified jets.

The signal size is chosen for illustration purposes to be 0.1\u03c3 ZH , to have a rounded number relatively close to the minimum where this analysis is expected to have sensitivity, and to avoid quoting large expected yields. The product of acceptance and selection efficiency increases at larger m H values because of the larger p T values for all objects in the events. The m T distributions for events with |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1 and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | > 1 after the event selection are shown in figure 3. Agreement between the data and the background-only prediction is observed. By using the fit strategy described in section 6, upper limits as a function of m H are derived for the product of \u03c3 ZH and B(H \u2192 invisible + \u03b3). For m H = 125 GeV, this result can be interpreted as an upper limit on B(H \u2192 invisible + \u03b3) assuming the production rate for an SM Higgs boson [29]. The upper limits at 95% CL are calculated using a modified frequentist approach with the CL s criterion [62,63] and asymptotic method for the test statistic [53,64]  range from \u223c40 to \u223c4 fb as m H increases from 125 to 300 GeV.

No significant excess of events above the expectation from standard model backgrounds is found. The results are used to place limits on the product of the cross section for associated ZH production and the branching -11 -JHEP10 (2019)139fraction for such decays of the Higgs boson, in the context of a theoretical model where the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% confidence level at m H = 125 GeV on B(H \u2192 invisible + \u03b3), assuming standard model ZH associated production, are 4.6 and 3.6%, respectively. Allowing for deviations from standard model ZH production, the product of \u03c3 ZH and B(H \u2192 invisible + \u03b3) is excluded above \u223c40 to \u223c4 fb, for m H ranging from 125 to 300 GeV.
