            "text": "Based on current CERN infrastructure, an electron-proton collider is proposed at a centre-of-mass energy of about 9 TeV. A 7 TeV LHC bunch is used as the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates electrons to 3 TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam. Although of very high energy, the collider has a modest projected integrated luminosity of 10-100 pb \u22121 . For such a collider, with a centre-of-mass energy 30 times greater than HERA, parton momentum fractions, x, down to about 10 \u22128 are accessible for photon virtualities, Q 2 , of 1 GeV 2 . The energy dependence of hadronic cross sections at high energies, such as the total photon-proton cross section, which has synergy with cosmic-ray physics, can be measured and QCD and the structure of matter better understood in a region where the effects are completely unknown. Searches at high Q 2 for physics beyond the Standard Model will be possible, in particular the significantly increased sensitivity to the production of leptoquarks. These and other physics highlights of a very high energy electronproton collider are outlined.",

With its centre-of-mass energy of about 300 GeV, HERA dramatically extended the kinematic reach [1] for the deep inelastic scattering process compared to fixed-target experiments. A broad range of physics processes were studied and new insights were gleaned from HERA which complemented the pp and e + e \u2212 colliders, the Tevatron and LEP. The LHeC project [2,3] is a proposed ep collider with significantly higher energy and luminosity than HERA with a programme to investigate Higgs physics and QCD, to search for new physics, etc. This will use significant parts of the LHC infrasa e-mail: mw@hep.ucl.ac.uk tructure at CERN with different configurations, such as e A, also possible.

            "text": "The VHEeP machine would strongly rely on the use of the LHC beams and the technique of plasma wakefield acceleration to accelerate electrons to 3 TeV over relatively short distances. Given such an acceleration scheme, the luminosity will be relatively modest with 10\u2212100 pb \u22121 expected over the lifetime of the collider. With such an increase in centreof-mass energy, the VHEeP collider will probe a new regime in deep inelastic scattering and QCD in general. The kinematic regime accessible will be extended by three orders of magnitude compared to that measured at HERA. This article puts forward the physics case for such a collider, highlighting some of the measurements most sensitive to unveiling new physics. Complementary studies of high energy ep colliders have been performed elsewhere [4][5][6], considering both the accelerator design [4,5] and physics potential [6].",

The basic kinematics and properties of the final state at these new energies are discussed and also their effect on the choice of detector design are described in Sect. 4. In Sects. 5 and 6, the headline physics areas in QCD and beyond the Standard Model are outlined. These include measuring the total photon-proton cross section, the deep inelastic scattering cross section at the lowest possible x values and the search for leptoquarks. In Sect. 7, the broad spectrum of other possible areas of study in high energy electron-proton collisions is briefly given.

Using a laser pulse or electron bunch to drive the plasma \"wakefield\", accelerating gradients of up to, respectively, 100 GV m \u22121 [12] and 50 GV m \u22121 [13] have been measured. This acceleration concept can also make use of bunches of protons [14], given high energy proton bunches are available and hence the possibility to have the acceleration performed in one stage. Simulation has shown that the plasma wakefield created by the LHC proton bunches can accelerate a trailing bunch of electrons to 6 TeV in 10 km [15]. The concept of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration will be tested by the AWAKE collaboration at CERN which aims to demonstrate the scheme for the first time [16][17][18]. The initial aims of the AWAKE experiment are to demonstrate GeV acceleration of electrons within 10 m of plasma [16][17][18]. Following this, the AWAKE collaboration proposes to accelerate bunches of electrons to 10 GeV in about 10 m of plasma [19].",

The facility uses one of the LHC proton beams to generate wakefields and accelerate a trailing electron bunch which then collides with the other proton beam. This is shown in a simple schematic in Fig. 1 in which the electron beam is chosen to have an energy of 3 TeV, achieved in a plasma accelerator of 4 km, and the proton beams have an energy of 7 TeV. Separation of the drive proton beam and witness electron beam will be needed to avoid pp collisions; as well as the temporal difference, the beams will need to be separated transversely by O (mm). Further study of this important issue is needed. Although the energy of VHEeP will be very high, obtaining high luminosities will be, as with all plasma wakefield acceleration schemes, a challenge. In these initial studies, an integrated luminosity over the lifetime of VHEeP of 10\u2212100 pb \u22121 is considered [20,21], based on the expected capabilities of the LHC and pre-accelerators. The lower limit will be sufficient for measurements at low x where the cross section is expected to rise with decreasing x. A higher integrated luminosity will aid the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, typically at high Q 2 .",

A projection for a measurement at the expected maximum W at VHEeP is also shown; further measurements of similar precision at lower W are also expected. The many cross sections at low energies can be fitted in Regge phenomenology in which the dominant contributions arise from Reggeon exchange, which falls with increasing centre-of-mass energy, and Pomeron exchange, which rises. As an example, two such fits from Donnachie and Landshoff [26,27] are shown in the figure. The 1992 fit predates HERA data and is made over the range 6 < W < 20 GeV. It has a single Pomeron term and a single Reggeon term. The 2004 fit includes HERA data (photoproduction, as well as DIS data for Q 2 < 45 GeV 2 ) and allows an additional second Pomeron term. Up to the highest HERA energies, both fits give good descriptions of the data. At higher energies, the second Pomeron term starts to become dominant and the cross-section predictions differ significantly. Also shown is an extrapolation based on the Froissart bound [28], \u03c3 \u03b3 p \u221d ln 2 (s). Assuming measurements from VHEeP up to W \u223c 6 TeV, even with very low luminosities (L = 49 nb \u22121 , as used in the ZEUS measurement [29]), the data will be able to strongly constrain the A photon-proton collision of W = 6 TeV, corresponding to photon and proton energies of, respectively, 1.3 and 7 TeV, is equivalent to a 20 PeV photon on a fixed target. This extends significantly into the region of ultra high energy cosmic rays. Therefore VHEeP data could be used to constrain cosmic-ray air-shower simulations and so will be of benefit to understanding the nature of cosmic rays at the highest energies (for example, see [30]).",

Clearly, the cross sections must take on another form and start to level out, be it through saturation or some other mechanism. As shown, data from VHEeP will be able to determine this behaviour.",

This interpretation relies on choosing a particular reference frame to view the scattering-the Bjorken frame. In the frame where the proton is at rest, it is the state of the photon or weak boson that differs with varying kinematic parameters. For the bulk of the electron-proton interactions, the scattering process involves a photon, and we can speak of different states of the photon scattering on a fixed proton target. What is seen is that the photon-proton cross section rises quickly with W for fixed Q 2 [39]. In the proton rest frame, we interpret this as follows: as the energy of the photon increases, time dilation allows shorter lived fluctuations of the photon to become active in the scattering process, thereby increasing the scattering cross section. Figure 8 shows the results of extrapolation of fits to the energy dependence of the photon-proton cross section for different virtualities as given in the caption [40], for two different assumptions on the energy behaviour. In one instance (blue curves), the energy dependence is assumed to follow a simple behaviour at small values of x:",

The HERA limits are \u03bb = 0.01 just below the kinematic limit of 0.3 TeV, rising rapidly to \u03bb = 1 at about 1 TeV [46,47]. Limits from the LHC experiments are also \u03bb = 1 at about 1\u22122 TeV for pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV for L \u223c 20 fb \u22121 [48,49]. Given the increased centre-of-mass energy and higher luminosities the sensitivity to leptoquark production at the LHC will extend to 2\u22123 TeV. Hence VHEeP has a sensitivity to leptoquark production significantly beyond the HERA limits and LHC limits, both measured and expected.",

Standard tests of QCD, performed at HERA and other colliders, will be possible in this new kinematic regime, such as measurements of the strong coupling constant, jet and heavy flavour production and properties of the hadronic final state. The structure of the proton and photon can be further investigated and fits of the parton densities to the data performed. The results will be related to the measurements above, sensitive to effects such as saturation, but more conventional determinations of the inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section can be made in a region less sensitive to the more exotic QCD effects. In particular, given the possibility to change the beam energy and to also vary this as widely as possible, the longitudinal structure function can be well measured, which was done with only limited precision at HERA given the relatively small lever arm in centre-ofmass energy [50,51]. Given the possibility to run with other heavy ions as well as protons in the LHC, VHEeP will also be able to investigate the properties of electron-ion, e A, scattering. Finally, diffraction, an area of QCD re-invigorated at HERA, and particularly sensitive to low-x dynamics can be studied.",

Recent simulations of the scheme indicate that acceleration of electrons with 7 TeV LHC proton bunches could be used to bring electrons to 3 TeV with an average gradient of about 1 GeV/m. This opens up tremendous opportunities for considering very high energy colliders; in this paper, we consider the possibility of colliding 3 TeV electrons accelerated in this way with 7 TeV protons from the LHC. This will allow an extension of the kinematic reach of the HERA electron-proton collider by three orders of magnitude, albeit with moderate luminosities.",

While cross sections for standard s-channel physics lead to extremely high luminosity requirements for TeV and beyond energy scales, there are physics questions which can be probed with lower luminosities. Since achieving high luminosities with realistic power consumption could be technologically much more difficult than achieving high energies, it is important that the physics case for a high energy but low luminosity collider be investigated. We consider just such an option in this paper-a very high energy electron-proton collider, VHEeP. We have investigated a number of physics topics that could be addressed by VHEeP and found that indeed very fundamental particle physics questions could be addressed by such a collider. These range from clarifying the underlying physics leading to the energy dependence of cross sections at very high energies, including unraveling the mechanisms for a saturation of the cross section growth, to opening new windows for physics beyond the reach of the LHC, such as leptoquark production with masses beyond 3 TeV. The studies presented in this paper are just a small first step in understanding the physics possibilities of such a collider, and we heartily encourage our colleagues to consider other topics. While we believe that the collider parameters given in this paper are achievable, there is a long road ahead to realise such a machine. New ideas could well arise along the way that would allow for higher luminosities than we have assumed here. Clearly, serious studies of the accelerator and detector will be needed. We believe these are warranted by the exciting physics that a collider such as VHEeP would provide.",
