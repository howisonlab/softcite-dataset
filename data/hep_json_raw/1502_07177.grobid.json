The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.5-20.3 fb \u22121 . No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed; 95% credibility upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction of Z resonances decaying into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pairs as a function of the resonance mass. As a result, Z bosons of the Sequential Standard Model with masses less than 2.02 TeV are excluded at 95% credibility. The impact of the fermionic couplings on the Z acceptance is investigated and limits are also placed on a Z model that exhibits enhanced couplings to third-generation fermions.",

            "text": "Searches for new heavy resonances decaying to tau lepton pairs are both theoretically and experimentally well motivated [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Heavy Z bosons often arise in grand unified theories and while they are typically considered to obey lepton universality, this is not necessarily a requirement. In particular, some models offering an explanation for the high mass of the top quark predict that such bosons preferentially couple to third-generation fermions [7,8]. Models containing non-universal Z bosons can explain the anomalous dimuon production observed at the D0 experiment [9,10] and the excess in semileptonic B-meson decays into tau leptons observed at the Belle and BaBar experiments [11][12][13]. Searches in the ditau channel are also sensitive to sgoldstino-like scalars in supersymmetric models [14,15], hidden sector Z models [16] and to the anomalous tau lepton dipole moments and higherorder tau-gluon couplings [17].",

The \u03c4 had \u03c4 had , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had and \u03c4 e \u03c4 had channels are analysed, accounting for 42%, 23% and 23% of the total \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 branching fraction, respectively.

The algorithm relies on a leading order approximation in which spin amplitudes are used to calculate the spin density matrices for hard 2 \u2192 2 Born level - processes. The impact of interference between Z and Z/\u03b3 * is typically small (as discussed in section 8.1), so it is not included. For each signal model, several mass hypotheses are considered, ranging from 500 to 2500 GeV in steps of 125 GeV. All generated events are propagated through a detailed Geant4 simulation [63] of the ATLAS detector and subdetector-specific digitisation algorithms [64] and are reconstructed with the same algorithms as the data. Pile-up is simulated by overlaying minimum-bias interactions generated with Pythia 8 (with an MC tune specific to the LHC [65]) on the generated signal and background events. The resulting events are reweighted so that the distribution of the number of minimum-bias interactions per bunch crossing agrees with data. Due to the high momenta of the tau decay products, however, pile-up has little impact on the analysis. The effective luminosity of most simulated samples is at least as large as the integrated luminosity of the data; the statistical uncertainty from the limited sample size is accounted for in the statistical analysis.",

The calculation of the four-momentum uses clusters with \u2206R < 0.2 from the initial jet-axis and includes a final tau-specific calibration derived from simulated samples, which accounts for out-of-cone energy, energy lost in dead material, underlyingevent and pile-up contributions and the typical composition of hadrons in hadronic tau decays. The size of the tau-specific calibration is typically a few percent. The calibrated energy scale in data and simulation have been compared and agree within the \u223c1.5% uncertainty of the measurement. Candidates are required to have either one or three associated tracks (prongs) reconstructed in the inner detector. The tau charge is reconstructed from the sum of the charges of the associated tracks and is required to be \u00b11. The charge misidentification probability is found to be negligible. Hadronic tau decays are identified with a multivariate algorithm that employs boosted decision trees (BDTs) to discriminate against quark-and gluon-initiated jets using shower shape and tracking information. Working points with a tau identification (ID) efficiency for 1-prong/3-prong candidates of about 55%/40% (medium) for the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had and \u03c4 e \u03c4 had channels and 65%/45% (loose) for the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel are chosen, leading to rates of false identification for quark-and gluoninitiated jets of below a percent. The tau ID efficiency is independent of p T and pile-up. Corrections of a few percent are applied to the efficiency in simulation. Candidates arising from the misidentification of electrons are rejected using a separate BDT. In the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had channel, a dedicated selection is applied to suppress candidates arising from the misidentification of muons. Tau candidates are required to have p T > 30 GeV and to be in the fiducial volume of the inner detector, |\u03b7| < 2.47. The transition region between the barrel and endcap EM calorimeters, with 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, is excluded. In the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channels, candidates that have the highest-p T track in the range |\u03b7| < 0.05 are rejected.

In contrast to the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel, the background is dominated by W +jets production, with a minor contribution from multijet production. To reduce the sensitivity to the differing fake-factors in W +jets and multijet events (due to a different quark/gluon fraction), events failing a very loose level of BDT tau identification (corresponding to efficiencies of 98% and 90% for 1-prong and 3-prong hadronic tau decays, respectively) are rejected. This significantly suppresses the gluon contribution, which typically consists of wider jets with higher hadron multiplicity which are more readily rejected by the tau ID. In the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channels, there is also a nonnegligible contribution to the first control region (fail-ID control region) from background processes containing hadronic tau decays, which is subtracted using simulation. The fakefactors are measured in a high-purity W +jets control region and they depend on p T , \u03b7  and N track of the tau candidate. The W +jets control region uses the same selection as the signal region but with the medium BDT tau ID replaced by very loose BDT tau ID and the m T requirement replaced by 70 GeV \u2264 m T \u2264 200 GeV. A second control region enriched in multijet events is defined, which has a higher fraction of gluon-initiated jets and represent an extreme variation in the jet composition. This control region uses the same selection as the W +jets control region but the lepton is required to fail isolation, the m T requirement is replaced by m T < 30 GeV and E miss T < 30 GeV is required. A 30% systematic uncertainty is derived from the difference in the fake-factors in the multijet and W +jets control regions. Figures 2(left) and 2(right) show the fake-factors measured in each of the two control regions in the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had channel, integrated across all |\u03b7| regions, for 1-prong and 3-prong candidates, respectively.

Firstly, the standard E miss T reconstruction treats the selected tau candidate in the fail-ID control region as a jet rather than a hadronic tau decay. Therefore, the E miss T is recalculated in the fail-ID control region using the tau hypothesis for the selected tau candidate. Following this, a slight bias in the shape of the E miss T distribution is corrected for by reweighting in bins of the E miss T projected along the direction of the tau candidate. An additional 20% uncertainty is applied to the estimate of the jet background event yield obtained after the full event selection, derived from the difference in the estimate between applying and not applying the E miss T reweighting.",

The events are required to contain one isolated muon that: has p T > 40 GeV, has E 0.2 T /p T < 6% and is matched to the object that passed the trigger. There must be no additional muons or electrons and at least one tau candidate with opposite charge to the muon. The remaining contamination from multijet events is suppressed by requiring cos \u2206\u03c6(\u00b5, E miss T ) + cos \u2206\u03c6(\u03c4 had-vis , E miss T ) < \u22120.15, which disfavours back-toback topologies where the E miss T vector points either in the direction of the muon or the tau candidate. The leading-p T tau candidate is used to measure the fake-rate. Figures 3(left) and 3(right) show R sub-lead tau-ID for 1-prong and 3-prong tau candidates, respectively. The fakerates R lead tau-ID (including the trigger requirement in the numerator) have a similar behaviour but are a factor of two to four lower. The requirement of opposite charge between the muon and the tau candidate enhances the contribution of the leading-order qg \u2192 Wq process in which the tau candidate originates from a quark-initiated jet. To evaluate the systematic uncertainty from applying these fake-rates to simulated samples with different jet origin, the fake-rates are also calculated for events where the tau candidate has the same charge sign as the muon. These events have a higher fraction of gluon-initiated jets and represent an extreme variation in the jet compostion, resulting in lower fake-rates as shown in figure 3(left) and figure 3(right). A 60% uncertainty is assigned to cover the range of the measured fake-rates for events with opposite-or same-sign tau candidates. The uncertainty is omitted for W +jets events as they are expected to have the same jet composition as events in the control region.

The uncertainty is evaluated using 90% CL MSTW2008NNLO PDF error sets and also takes into account potential differences between the following PDFs at the same \u03b1 S : MSTW2008NNLO, CT10NNLO, NNPDF2.3 [76], ABM11 [77] and HERAPDF1.5 [78].

This uncertainty is not considered for the signal as it is strongly model dependent. An uncertainty of 5% is estimated for diboson production, derived from scale, PDF and \u03b1 S variations.

            "text": "Changing the fermionic couplings of the Z from their SSM values can alter the signal acceptance of the analysis. Such changes are primarily due to alterations in either the tau polarisation or the total Z decay width. Alteration of the tau polarisation changes the tau decay kinematics. Most importantly it affects the visible momentum fraction, which enters the analysis through the p T thresholds of the reconstructed visible tau decay products and via the threshold on m tot T . The most extreme impact on the acceptance is seen for models that couple only to left-handed or right-handed tau leptons: Z L and Z R , respectively. Alteration of the quark couplings can impact the acceptance if it alters the tau polarisation. However, the maximum impact is much smaller than when altering the couplings to tau leptons. As the kinematic limit (due to the collision energy) for high-mass Z production is approached, the signal exhibits an increased fraction of low-mass off-shell production. The fraction of off-shell events increases rapidly as a function of the decay width. Figure 4 shows A\u03b5 for the Z L and Z R models, and two models with artificially altered decay widths: Z narrow (\u0393/m Z = 1%) and Z wide (\u0393/m Z = 20%), each divided by A\u03b5 for Z SSM (\u0393/m Z \u2248 3%). Interference between Z and Z/\u03b3 * is not included. The statistical uncertainty is typically below 5% but can be up to 14% at low mass. A smoothing is applied to reduce fluctuations. For Z L and Z R , the largest impact is observed at low mass, where the p T and m tot T thresholds are much more stringent on the signal. In this case, alteration of the tau couplings can lead to changes of up to +50% and \u221225%. The impact on the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had and \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channels are different due to the different effect of polarisation on leptonic and hadronic tau decays. For Z narrow and Z wide , the impact is most prominent at high mass where changes of up to +20% and \u221245% are observed. At low mass, A\u03b5 only changes for widths above 10%. The impact is the same for all channels. For all Z models, the change in A is very similar to that in A\u03b5, indicating that the efficiency is insensitive to changes in the Z couplings.",

The model is motivated by the idea that the large mass of the top-quark may suggest that the third fermion generation has a dynamical behaviour different from the first two generations. Accordingly, the SM weak SU(2) gauge group is split into two parts: one coupling to light fermions (the first two generations), SU(2) l and one coupling to heavy fermions (the third generation), SU(2) h .

Large mixing between \u03c4 and \u00b5 leptons has been considered as an additional feature of the model, but is ignored here as it would lead to stronger limits via the dielectron and dimuon searches. The Z NU couples almost exclusively to left-handed fermions, and while the coupling strength differs for light and heavy fermions, it is largely insensitive to the electric charge or weak isospin, leading to almost universal couplings for all light and heavy fermions.  by weakened couplings to light quarks (sin 2 \u03c6 \u223c 0) or the branching fraction is suppressed by weakened couplings to tau leptons (sin 2 \u03c6 \u223c 1).

The \u03c4 had \u03c4 had , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had and \u03c4 e \u03c4 had channels are analysed. The observed number of events in regions with high total transverse mass are consistent with the SM expectations. Limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction for such resonances. The resulting lower limit on the mass of a Z decaying to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in the Sequential Standard Model is 2.02 TeV at 95% credibility, in agreement with the expected limit of 1.95 TeV in the absence of a signal. The impact on the Z acceptance from altering the Z couplings and the total decay width is found to be significant, and can be up to 50%. The impact from interference between Z and Z/\u03b3 * is only important when the total decay width of the Z is large. Limits on the non-universal G(221) model are also established, where Z bosons with masses below 1.3-2.1 TeV are excluded in the range 0.03 < sin 2 \u03c6 < 0.5 assuming no \u00b5-\u03c4 mixing.",
