The theoretical description of these nonperturbative processes, which have not yet been measured in detail at the LHC, poses a significant challenge to models. The two pions are measured and identified in the CMS silicon tracker based on specific energy loss, whereas the absence of other particles is ensured by calorimeter information. The total and differential cross sections of exclusive and semiexclusive central \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production are measured as functions of invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system in the fiducial region defined as transverse momentum p T (\u03c0) > 0.2 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7(\u03c0)| < 2.4.

            "text": "The central exclusive production (CEP) process has been studied for a long time from both theoretical [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] and experimental [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] perspectives. In this process, both protons remain intact in the collision and a central system is produced. The process is referred to as exclusive when no particles other than the central system are produced. If one or both protons dissociate into a forward diffractive system, the process is called semiexclusive production. Various central systems can be produced in this process, like \u03c0  (VMP), which are illustrated by the diagrams shown in Fig. 1. The pomeron (P) is a color singlet object introduced to explain the rise of e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch the inelastic cross section at high collision energies [19,20]. The quantum numbers of the pomeron constrain the possible central systems in DPE processes, whereas the photon exchange restricts the central system in VMP processes. By functioning as a quantum number filter, the CEP process is suitable to study low-mass resonances, which would be difficult to study otherwise. Furthermore, DPE processes are also suitable to search for glueballs (bound states of gluons without valence quarks), because they provide a gluon-rich environment [21,22]. Another process that could contribute to the same final state is the two-photon fusion \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0",

Within the solenoid volume are a tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, covering the |\u03b7| < 3.0 region. Forward calorimeters extend the \u03b7 coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and is located in the 3.8 T solenoid field. Three pixel barrel layers (PXB) are situated at radii of 4.4, 7.3, and 10.2 cm; PXB also has two pixel endcap disks (PXF). The strip tracker consists of the innermost tracker inner barrel (TIB) and the tracker inner disks (TID), which are surrounded by the tracker outer barrel (TOB). It is completed by endcaps (TEC) on both sides. The barrel part of the strip tracker has a total of 10 layers at radii from 25 to 110 cm, whereas the endcap of the strip tracker consists of 12 layers.

The multiparticle background in the selected exclusive sample consists of events with more than two particles created in the interaction, of which only two are observed because the additional particles yield energy deposits below the thresholds, or outside the acceptance. The SD, DD, ND, and CD processes with more than two centrally produced particles belong to this contribution. A method based on control regions is used to estimate this multiparticle background. Control regions are selected in which events have at least two calorimeter towers above threshold, not matched to the two selected pions, with all the other selection criteria satisfied. The distribution of the number of events selected in this way as a function of the number of extra towers with energy above threshold is shown in Fig. 3. The counts in the bins with 2, 3, 4, and 5 towers are used to estimate the background. The normalization factor is calculated using the following assumption: ",

The validity of this assumption is checked by comparing the true and predicted number of background events in inclusive MC samples (Table 3). The observed discrepancy reflects the differences between OS and SS events and is included as a systematic uncertainty in the estimate of the total number of multiparticle background events, as discussed in Sect. 5.4. With this formula and the fact that all SS events are multiparticle events because of charge conservation, it is possible to calculate the value of N mhad,OS (0 towers), which is the number of multiparticle background events. The expected distribution of the multiparticle background is obtained using OS events with 2-5 extra calorimeter towers. This method does not take into account the background contribution from \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , because this decay cannot be observed in the SS events. This latter contribution is negligible (0.5%) based on MC simulation results.  this assumption and the measured ratios, the average K/\u03c0 and p/\u03c0 ratios are then calculated over the entire momentum range of the exclusive sample. These average ratios can then be used to compute the number of K + K \u2212 and pp events under two extreme scenarios.

These include reconstruction effects, particle identification, correction factors, background estimation, and the luminosity estimation. The uncertainty assigned to the tracking efficiency in the case of a single track is 3.9% [29], which corresponds to 7.8% uncertainty for two tracks. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the multiple reconstruction rate for a single track is also 3.9%, which propagates to a maximum of 0.4% uncertainty in the cross section for two tracks, which is neglected in the analysis. Misreconstructed tracks bias the sample in two ways: either a CEP event is rejected if a third misreconstructed track is found, or an event is identified as CEP with a misreconstructed and a genuine track. This source of systematic uncertainty is estimated to be 1% for a single track, which is the maximal misreconstruction rate calculated using inclusive MC samples in the kinematic region ( p T (\u03c0) > 0.2 GeV and |\u03b7(\u03c0)| < 2.4) of the analysis. Since the probability to have two or more misreconstructed tracks in these low-multiplicity events is negligible, the final uncertainty remains 1%. From the comparison of the dime mc and starlight simulations, the uncertainty of the vertex correction is estimated to be 1%. The systematic uncertainty in the pileup correction factor for a single event is calculated from only the systematic uncertainties in the luminosity measurement that do not affect its overall normalization. Indeed, the normalization-related systematic uncertainties are compensated in the exponential fit described in Sect. 5.2. The uncertainties that do not affect the normalization are estimated to be 1.6% and 1.5% for 5.02 [44] and 13 TeV [45] data, respectively. These values propagate to a 1% uncertainty in the pileup correction factor for a single event.

Exclusive events are selected by vetoing additional energy deposits in the calorimeters and by requiring two oppositely charged pions identified via their mean energy loss in the tracker detectors. These events are used together with correction factors to obtain invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity distributions of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system. The measured total exclusive \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production cross section is 32.6 \u00b1 0.7 (stat) \u00b1 6.0 (syst) \u00b1 0.8 (lumi) and 33.7 \u00b1 1.0 (stat)\u00b1 6.2 (syst) \u00b1 0.8 (lumi) \u03bcb for 5.02 and 13 TeV, respectively. The observed mass spectrum exhibits resonant structures, which can be fitted with a simple model containing four interfering Breit-Wigner functions, corresponding to the f 0 (500), \u03c1 0 (770), f 0 (980), and f 2 (1270) resonances, and a continuum contribution modeled by the dime mc. The exclusive production cross sections are extracted from this fit. The obtained cross sections of \u03c1 0 (770) production are higher than the starlight model prediction, which can be explained by the presence of semiexclusive production which is not modeled by the starlight generator. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
