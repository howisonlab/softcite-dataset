            "text": "The top quark mass is measured using a template method in the tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel (lepton is e or \u03bc) using ATLAS data recorded in 2012 at the LHC. The data were taken at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel is characterized by the presence of a charged lepton, a neutrino and four jets, two of which originate from bottom quarks (b). Exploiting a three-dimensional template technique, the top quark mass is determined together with a global jet energy scale factor and a relative b-to-light-jet energy scale factor. The mass of the top quark is measured to be m top = 172.08 \u00b1 0.39 (stat) \u00b1 0.82 (syst) GeV. A combination with previous ATLAS m top measurements gives m top = 172.69 \u00b1 0.25 (stat) \u00b1 0.41 (syst) GeV.

The result is obtained from pp collision data recorded in 2012 at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV with an integrated luminosity of about 20.2 fb \u22121 . The analysis exploits the decay tt \u2192 W + W \u2212 bb \u2192 \u03bdqq bb, which occurs when one W boson decays into a charged lepton ( is e or \u03bc including \u03c4 \u2192 e, \u03bc decays) and a neutrino (\u03bd), and the other into a pair of quarks. In the analysis presented here, m top is obtained from the combined sample of events selected in the elec-tron+jets and muon+jets final states. Single-top-quark events with the same reconstructed final states contain information about the top quark mass and are therefore included as signal events.",

These templates are fitted to functions that interpolate between different input values of the physics parameter while fixing all other parameters of the functions. In the final step, an unbinned likelihood fit to the observed data distribution is used to obtain the value of the physics parameter that best describes the data. In this procedure, the experimental distributions are constructed such that fits to them yield unbiased estimators of the physics parameter used as input in the signal Monte Carlo (MC) samples. Consequently, the top quark mass determined in this way corresponds to the mass definition used in the MC simulation. Because of various steps in the event simulation, the mass measured in this way does not necessarily directly coincide with mass definitions within a given renormalization scheme, e.g. the top quark pole mass. Evaluating these differences is a topic of theoretical investigations [15][16][17][18][19].",

It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. Its bending power is 2.0 to 7.5 T m. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A three-level trigger system was used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and used a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels that together reduced the accepted event rate to 400 Hz on average depending on the data-taking conditions during 2012.",

The integrated luminosity is 20.2 fb \u22121 with an uncertainty of 1.9% [21]. The modelling of top quark pair (tt) and single-top-quark signal events, as well as most background processes, relies on MC simulations. For the simulation of tt and single-top-quark events, the Powheg-Box v1 [22][23][24] program was used. Within this framework, the simulations of the tt [25] and single-top-quark production in the s-and t-channels [26] and the W t-channel [27] used matrix elements at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S with the NLO CT10 [28] parton distribution function (PDF) set and the h damp parameter 2 set to infinity. Using m top and the top quark transverse momentum p T for the underlying leading-order Feynman diagram, the dynamic factorization and renormalization scales were set to m 2 top + p 2 T . The Pythia (v6.425) program [29] with the P2011C [30] set of tuned parameters (tune) and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDFs [31] provided the parton shower, hadronization and underlying-event modelling.",

The CTEQ6L1 PDFs and the corresponding AUET2 tune [47] were used for the matrix element and parton shower settings. The W +jets and Z +jets events containing heavyflavour (HF) quarks (W bb+jets, Zbb+jets, W cc+jets, Zcc+jets, and W c+jets) were generated separately using leading-order (LO) matrix elements with massive bottom and charm quarks. Double-counting of HF quarks in the matrix element and the parton shower evolution was avoided via a HF overlap-removal procedure that used the R between the additional heavy quarks as the criterion. If the R was smaller than 0.4, the parton shower prediction was taken, while for larger values, the matrix element prediction was used. The Z +jets sample is normalized to the inclusive NNLO calculation [48]. Due to the large uncertainties in the overall W +jets normalization and the flavour composition, both are estimated using data-driven techniques as described in Sect. 4.2. Diboson production processes (W W , W Z and Z Z) were simulated using the Alpgen program with CTEQ6L1 PDFs interfaced to the Herwig (v6.520) [49] and Jimmy (v4.31) [50] programs. The samples are normalized to their predicted cross-sections at NLO [51].",

The number of additional interactions is Poisson-distributed around the mean number of inelastic pp interactions per bunch crossing \u03bc. For a given simulated hard-scatter event, the value of \u03bc depends on the instantaneous luminosity and the inelastic pp cross-section, taken to be 73 mb [21].

The systematic uncertainty assigned to each bin is calculated from the sum in quadrature of all systematic uncertainties discussed in Sect. 4.3. Within uncertainties, the predictions agree with the observed distributions in Fig. 1, which shows the transverse momentum of the lepton, the average transverse momentum of the jets, the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark p T,had , the transverse momentum of the tt system, the logarithm of the event likelihood of the best permutation and the distance R of the two untagged jets q 1 and q 2 assigned to the hadronically decaying W boson. The distributions of transverse momenta predicted by the simulation, e.g. the p T,had distribution shown in Fig. 1c, show a slightly different trend than observed in data, with the data being softer. This difference is fully covered by the uncertainties. This trend was also observed in Ref.

Compared with the preselection, cm is increased from 0.71 to 0.82, albeit at the expense of a significant reduction in the number of selected events. The purity \u03c0 cm is increased from 0.28 to 0.41. In addition, the intrinsic resolution in m top of the remaining event sample is improved, i.e. the statistical uncertainty in m top in Fig. 3 is almost constant as a function of r BDT ; in particular, it does not scale with the square root of the number of events retained. For the signal sample with m top = 172.5 GeV, the template fit functions for the standard selection and the BDT selection, together with their ratios, are shown in Fig. 12 in Appendix A. The shape of the signal modelling uncertainty derives from a sum of contributions with different shapes. The curves from the signal Monte Carlo generator and colour reconnection uncertainties decrease, the one from the underlying event uncertainty is flat, the one from the initial-and final-state QCD radiation has a valley similar to the sum of all contributions, and finally the one from the hadronization uncertainty rises. Some distributions of the observed event kinematics after the BDT selection are shown in Fig. 4. Good agreement between the MC predictions and the data is found, as seen for the preselection in Fig. 1. The examples shown are the observed W boson transverse mass for the semi-leptonically decaying top quark in Fig. 4a and the three observables of the m top analysis (within the ranges of the template fit) in Fig. 4b-d. The sharp edge observed at 30 GeV in Fig. 4a originates from the different selection requirements for the W boson transverse mass in the electron+jets and muon+jets final states.",

By using JSF and bJSF, most of the uncertainties in m top induced by JES and bJES uncertainties are transformed into additional statistical components caused by the higher dimensionality of the fit. This method reduces the total uncertainty in m top only for sufficiently large data samples. In this case, the sum in quadrature of the additional statistical uncertainty in m top due to the JSF (or bJSF) fit and the residual JES-induced (or bJES-induced) systematic uncertainty is smaller than the original JES-induced (or bJES-induced) uncertainty in m top .

If possible, the corresponding uncertainty in m top is evaluated by varying the respective quantities by \u00b11\u03c3 from their default values, constructing the corresponding event sample and measuring the average m top change relative to the result from the nomi-nal MC sample with 500 pseudo-experiments each, drawn from the full MC sample. In the absence of a \u00b11\u03c3 variation, e.g. for the evaluation of the uncertainty induced by the choice of signal MC generator, the full observed difference is assigned as a symmetric systematic uncertainty and further treated as a variation equivalent to a \u00b11\u03c3 variation. Wherever a \u00b11\u03c3 variation can be performed, half the observed difference between the +1\u03c3 and \u22121\u03c3 variation in m top is assigned as an uncertainty if the m top values obtained from   the variations lie on opposite sides of the nominal result. If they lie on the same side, the maximum observed difference is taken as a symmetric systematic uncertainty. Since the systematic uncertainties are derived from simulation or data samples with limited numbers of events, all systematic uncertainties have a corresponding statistical uncertainty, which is calculated taking into account the statistical correlation of the considered samples, as explained in Sect. 8.5. The statistical uncertainty in the total systematic uncertainty is dominated by the limited sizes of the simulation samples. The resulting systematic uncertainties are given in Table 3 independent of their statistical significance. Further information is given in Tables 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in Appendix A.

The individual uncertainties are compared in Table 3 for three cases: the standard selection for the \u221a s = 7 TeV [9] and 8 TeV data and the BDT selection for \u221a s = 8 TeV data. Many uncertainties in m top obtained with the standard selection at the two centre-of-mass energies agree within their statistical uncertainties such that the resulting total systematic uncertainties are almost identical. Consequently, repeating the \u221a s = 7 TeV analysis on \u221a s = 8 TeV data would have only improved the statistical precision. The picture changes when comparing the uncertainties in \u221a s = 8 TeV data for the standard selection and the BDT selection. In general, the experimental uncertainties change only slightly, with the largest reduction observed for the JES uncertainty. In contrast, a large improvement comes from the reduced uncertainties in the modelling of the tt signal processes as shown in Table 3. This, together with the improved intrinsic resolution in m top , more than compensates for the small loss in precision caused by the increased statistical uncertainty. The individual sources of systematic uncertainties and the evaluation of their effect on m top are described in the following.",

The systematic uncertainty in m top from the uncertainty in the single-top-quark normalization is estimated from the corresponding uncertainty in the theoretical cross-section given in Sect. 3. The resulting systematic uncertainty is small compared with the systematic uncertainty in the tt production and is consequently neglected. For the modelling of the signal processes, the consequence of including single-top-quark variations in the uncertainty evaluation was investigated for various uncertainty sources and found to be negligible. Therefore, the single-top-quark variations are not included in the determination of the signal event uncertainties. As shown in Fig. 1, the distributions of transverse momenta in data are slightly softer than those in the Powheg+Pythia MC simulation samples. Similarly to what was observed in the tt \u2192 dilepton channel for the p T, b distribution, in the tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel the Powheg+Herwig sample is much closer to the data for several distributions of transverse momenta. The p T,had distribution is much better described by the Powheg+Herwig sample as was also observed in Ref. [78]. In addition, but to a lesser extent, the MC@NLO sample used to assess the signal Monte Carlo generator uncertainty and the samples to assess the initial-and final-state QCD radiation uncertainty discussed next also lead to a softer distribution in simulation. Given this, the observed difference in the p T,had distribution is covered by a combination of the signal-modelling uncertainties given in Table 3.",

The most complex cases are the uncertainties involving eigenvector decompositions, such as the JES and b-tagging scale factor uncertainties, and the uncertainty categories that do not apply to all input measurements. The JESuncertainty-induced uncertainty in m top is obtained from a number of JES subcomponents. Some JES subcomponents have an equivalent at the other centre-of-mass energy and others do not. As in Ref. [14], the JES subcomponents without an equivalent at the other centre-of-mass energy are treated as independent, resulting in vanishing estimator correlations for that part of the covariance matrix. For the remaining subcomponents, the estimator correlations are partly positive and partly negative. As an example, for the flavour part of the JES-uncertainty-induced uncertainty in m top , the two most precise results, the tt \u2192 dilepton and tt \u2192 lepton + jets measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV, are negatively correlated. Consequently, for this pair, the resulting estimator correlation for the total JES-induced uncertainty in m top is also negative. At the quoted precision, the two assumptions about the equivalence of the JES subcomponents between the datasets at the two centre-of-mass energies, i.e. the weak and strong correlation scenarios described in Table 10 in Appendix A, leave the combined value and uncertainty unchanged.",

The BLUE method uses a linear combination of the inputs to combine measurements. The coefficients (BLUE weights) are determined via the minimization of the variance of the combined result. They can be used to construct measures for the importance of a given single measurement in the combination [98]. For any combination, the measured values x i , the list of uncertainties \u03c3 ik and the correlations \u03c1 i jk of the estimators (i, j) for each source of uncertainty (k) have to be provided. For all uncertainties, a Gaussian probability distribution function is assumed. For the uncertainties in m top for which the measurements are correlated, when using \u00b11\u03c3 variations of a systematic effect, e.g. when changing the bJES by \u00b11\u03c3 , there are two possibilities. When simultaneously applying a variation for a systematic uncertainty, e.g. +1\u03c3 for the bJES, to a pair (i, j) of measurements, e.g. the tt \u2192 lepton + jets and tt \u2192 dilepton measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV, both analyses can result in a larger or smaller m top value than the one obtained for the nominal case (full correlation, \u03c1 i jk = +1), or one analysis can result in a larger and the other in a smaller value (full anti-correlation, \u03c1 i jk = \u22121). Consequently, an uncertainty from a source only consisting of a single variation, such as the bJES-uncertainty-induced uncertainty or the uncertainty related to the choice of MC generator for signal events, results in a correlation of \u03c1 i jk = \u00b11. The estimator correlations for composite uncertainties are evaluated by calculating the correlation from the subcomponents. As an example, for the tt \u2192 lepton + jets result at \u221a s = 8 TeV, the subcomponents of the JES uncertainty are shown in Table 10 in Appendix A. For any pair of measurements (i, j), this evaluation is done by adding the covariance terms of the subcomponents k with \u03c1 i jk = \u00b11 and dividing by the total uncertainties for that source.

            "text": "ik is the sum of the single subcomponent variances in analysis i. This procedure is applied to all uncertainty sources that consist of more than one subcomponent to reduce the large list of uncertainty subcomponents per estimator of O(100) to a suitable number of uncertainty sources, i.e. to those given in Table 4. Since the full  Fig. 7d is for the two analyses in the tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel at the two centreof-mass energies. Each point represents the observed shifts for a systematic uncertainty or a subcomponent of a systematic uncertainty together with a cross, indicating the corresponding statistical precision in the systematic uncertainty in the two results. The solid points indicate the fully correlated cases, and the open points indicate the anti-correlated ones. 8 For many significant sources of uncertainty in Fig. 7a, the tt \u2192 lepton + jets and tt \u2192 dilepton measurements are anti-correlated. As shown in Ref. [9], this is caused by the in situ determination of the JSF and bJSF in the threedimensional tt \u2192 lepton + jets analysis. In contrast, for most sources of uncertainty, a positive estimator correlation is observed for the tt \u2192 dilepton and tt \u2192 all jets measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV, shown in Fig. 7b. The prominent     exception is the hadronization-uncertainty-induced uncertainty in m top , i.e. the single largest uncertainty in the tt \u2192 all jets measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV, for which the two measurements are anti-correlated. On the contrary, the tt \u2192 lepton + jets and tt \u2192 all jets measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV, shown in Fig. 7c, are positively correlated for this uncertainty. Finally, the tt \u2192 lepton + jets measurements at the two centre-of-mass energies in Fig. 7d show a rather low correlation. The correlations per source of uncertainty and the total estimator correlations are summarized in Table 5.",

Adding the remaining results reduces the quoted combined uncertainty by 0.02 GeV, which is smaller than the statistical precision in the uncertainty of the previously achieved result of m (3) top . The changes in statistical uncertainties in the combined value and its uncertainty due to variations of the input systematic uncertainties within their uncertainties are evaluated for two cases, namely for m (3) top and for the combination of all results. Following Ref.

An optimization employing a BDT selection to efficiently suppress less-well-reconstructed events results in a significant reduction in total uncertainty, driven by a significant decrease in theory-modelling-induced uncertainties. With this approach, the measured value of m top is m top = 172.08 \u00b1 0.39 (stat) \u00b1 0.82 (syst) GeV with a total uncertainty of 0.91\u00b10.06 GeV, where the quoted uncertainty in the total uncertainty is statistical. The precision is limited by systematic uncertainties, mostly by uncertainties in the calibration of the jet energy scale, b-tagging and the Monte Carlo modelling of signal events. This result is more precise than the result from the CDF experiment, but less precise than the CMS and D0 results, measured in the same channel.",

The distributions of m reco top and m reco W are narrower for the BDT event selection, which means the resolution in the two masses is improved compared with what is observed for the standard selection. The R reco bq distribution is slightly shifted to lower values for the BDT event selection, but the difference is small.  For the BDT selection, a number of systematic uncertainties listed in Table 3 are calculated by performing pseudoexperiments for more than one systematic variation.

            "text": "[65].b-tagging:Mismodelling of the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rate is accounted for by the application of jet-specific scale factors to simulated events[66]. These scale factors depend on jet p T , jet \u03b7 and the underlying quark flavour. The ones used in this analysis are derived from dijet and tt \u2192 dilepton [66] events. They are the same as those used for the measurement of m top in the tt \u2192 dilepton channel[14].Similarly to the JES uncertainties, the b-tagging uncertainties are estimated by using an eigenvector approach, based on the b-tagging calibration analysis[66][67][68]. They include the uncertainties in the b-tagging, c/\u03c4 -tagging and mistagging scale factors. This uncertainty in m top is derived by varying the scale factors within their uncertainties and adding the resulting fitted differences in quadrature. In this procedure, uncertainties that are considered both in the b-tagging calibration and as separate sources in the m top analysis are taken into account simultaneously by applying the corresponding varied b-tagging scale factors together with the varied sample when assessing the corresponding uncertainty in m top . The final uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of these independent components. Compared with the result from \u221a s = 7 TeV data, this uncertainty is reduced by about one third for both the standard and BDT event selections in accordance with the improvements made in the calibrations of the b-tagging algorithm[66,67].Leptons:The lepton uncertainties are related to the electron energy or muon momentum scale and resolution, as well as trigger, isolation and identification efficiencies. These are measured very precisely in high-purity J/\u03c8 \u2192 + \u2212 and Z \u2192 + \u2212 data [57,58,95]. For each component, the corresponding uncertainty is propagated to the analysis by variation of the respective quantity. The changes are propagated to the E miss T as well.Missing transverse momentum:The remaining contribution to the missing-transverse-momentum uncertainty stems from the uncertainties in calorimeter-cell energies associated with lowp T jets (7 GeV < p T < 20 GeV) without any corresponding reconstructed physics object or from pile-up interactions. They are accounted for as described in Ref.[69]. The corresponding uncertainty in m top is small.Pile-up:Besides the component treated in the JES uncertainty, the residual dependence of the fitted m top on the amount of pile-up activity and a possible mismodelling of pile-up in MC simulation is determined. For this, the m top dependence in bins of n vtx and \u03bc is determined for data and MC simulated events. Within the statistical uncertainties, the slopes of the linear dependences of m top observed in data and predicted by the MC simulation are compatible. The same is true for JSF and bJSF. The final effect on the measurement is assessed by a convolution of the linear dependence with the respective n vtx and \u03bc distributions observed for data and MC simulated events. The maximum of the n vtx and \u03bc effects is assigned as an uncertainty due to pile-up. The pile-up conditions differ between the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data. For the BDT selection of \u221a s = 8 TeV data used here, the average of the mean number of inelastic pp interactions per bunch crossing is \u03bc = 20.3 and the average number of reconstructed primary vertices is about n vtx = 9.4, to be compared with \u03bc = 8.8 and n vtx = 7.0 for \u221a s = 7 TeV data[65]",

Treating the pairs of measurements in the three tt decay channels as determining potentially different masses, namely m consistent values within uncertainties, i.e. the data do not show any sign of a decay-channel-dependent m top .The combined result of m top from the six measurements is m top = 172.69 \u00b1 0.25 (stat) \u00b1 0.41 (syst) GeV with a total uncertainty of 0.48\u00b10.03 GeV, where the quoted uncertainty in the total uncertainty is statistical. This combination is dominated by three input measurements: the measurement in the tt \u2192 dilepton channel from \u221a s = 8 TeV data and the two measurements in the tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel from \u221a s = 8 and 7 TeV data. With a relative precision of 0.28%, this new ATLAS combination of m top is more precise than the result from the CDF and D0 experiments and has a precision similar to the CMS combined result. This result supersedes the previous combined ATLAS result.With this precision in m top achieved, precise knowledge of the relation between the mass definition of the experimental analysis and the pole mass is becoming relevant. The com-bined result is mostly limited by the uncertainties in the calibration of the jet energy scales, b-tagging and in the Monte Carlo modelling of signal events.
