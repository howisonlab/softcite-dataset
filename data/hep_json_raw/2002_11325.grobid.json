            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM), events with two or more jets are usually produced by strong interactions described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Searches for resonances in dijet invariant-mass distributions provide a means to investigate a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Such searches are sensitive to heavy particles that decay into two partons which, following fragmentation, form two jets. Studies of this kind were among the first published using early data from the ATLAS [1][2][3][4] and CMS [5][6][7] experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, when operations at high energy first began. Later results used new datasets as the LHC increased the collision energy, from 7 TeV to 8 TeV during Run 1 [8][9][10], and then to 13 TeV for Run 2 [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. Typically, these searches initially focused on resonances with high dijet invariant masses, m jj , e.g. on enhanced event yields in the new kinematic regime opened up by the increase in energy. However, as the integrated luminosity collected at the highest available energy increased, without signs of new physics at high masses, there has been renewed interest in exploiting these large datasets to also look for signals in the region m jj < 1 TeV. These low-mass regions are difficult to access in inclusive dijet searches due to limitations imposed by -1 -",

Such studies have been performed with inclusive samples using analyses done at so-called 'trigger level' [10,13]. Other strategies involve requiring the presence of an associated object that can be used for triggering, such as a photon [19,20] or a jet [21][22][23][24] from initial-state radiation. The results presented here complement these techniques by searching for dijet resonances in events containing an isolated electron (e) or muon (\u00b5). Besides providing access to lower dijet invariant masses, the requirement of a final-state lepton in addition to jets provides sensitivity to a set of new-physics models that cannot be studied using jet triggers.",

The H + decay into tb is assumed. Parton showering and hadronisation are modelled using Pythia 8 with the A14 tune. This simulation uses the narrow-width approximation [57], and effects related to W boson polarisation and the interference between tbH + and the SM tt + bb background are not included. The narrow-width approximation has a negligible impact on the limit presented in this paper since the peak in the m jj distribution has a relative half width at half maximum (HWHM) of about 30% of the m jj peak position. This width is much larger than the H + natural width of about 4% of the H + mass for tan \u03b2 = 1, where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two scalar doublets in the 2HDM. While the tb final state includes more than two jets, simulation studies indicate that, for events arising from the tbH + process, m jj distributions obtained from the two JHEP06(2020)151 highest-p T jets have well-defined peaks for m H + values above 600 GeV.

(5.1) to accurately describe the background in the signal region, a likelihood fit is performed to the background estimate obtained from MC simulations of QCD multijet, W +jets and tt samples. The combined contribution from W and top-quark processes in the MC simulations varies from 1% to 10% as a function of m jj . The five-parameter fit function provides a good description of the signal region in this -7 -JHEP06(2020)151 MC sample. However, eq. (5.1) with p 5 = 0 also provides an adequate description of this distribution, which has far fewer events than are available in data. Additional studies were therefore undertaken, as described below. One is based on a control region (CR) defined for MC simulation, and the other on a CR defined for data; both provide far more events than are available in the MC distribution discussed above. These studies are also used to investigate possible effects related to jet reconstruction, or to leptons misidentified as jets, which may lead to structures in the m jj distribution that can be difficult to describe with a smoothly falling distribution and could be misinterpreted as a potential signal. In the first of these, a three-jet control region, referred to as the '2+1 jets' CR is constructed using MC events. This is identical to the signal region with the exception that a third jet with p T > 60 GeV is required instead of the charged lepton. Removing the requirement of a finalstate lepton increases the number of events in the dominant multijet background sample by more than an order of magnitude. No significant deviations of the MC distribution from the fit hypothesis of eq. (5.1) are observed in the 2+1 jets CR. The composition of this CR illustrates the decreased relative contributions from W and top-quark processes when requiring a third jet instead of a final-state lepton. Here, in the 2+1 jets CR, W and top processes contribute to the overall background at a level of less than 0.1% relative to QCD multijets.",

The LE-CR is expected to have an increased multijet contribution due to the contamination from misidentified electrons. The main goal of this region is to verify that the data do not show structures that can be interpreted as signals when using the analytic fits. The number of events in the LE-CR is a factor of ten larger than in the 2+1 jets CR used in MC studies. Studies of this control region demonstrate that jet reconstruction does not lead to structures that can be interpreted as signals. The fit hypothesis of eq.

The Bayesian Analysis Toolkit [65] is used to set 95% credibility level (CL) upper limits on the cross-section for new processes that have a signature of a new particle decaying into partons which fragment to two jets in events with at least one isolated lepton of p T > 60 GeV. In the case where no statistically significant deviations are observed according to the BumpHunter test, the exclusion limits are set at the 95% CL on the production cross-section times branching ratio for generic resonances, as well as for a range of theories beyond the Standard Model. For each test contribution from a signal model, a simultaneous likelihood fit of data using the signal contribution plus the background function is performed, with an additional parameter describing the normalisation of the -9 -JHEP06(2020)151 signal template. The free parameters of the fit function are considered as nuisance parameters. Systematic uncertainties are also included as nuisance parameters. To make sure the convergence of the likelihood fits, the initial parameters of the background function are set to the values determined during the search phase, but the parameters were not fixed or constrained during the fits. For a given mass, a number of such fits are performed for a range of possible signal yields. The resulting likelihood function is multiplied by a flat prior to give a posterior probability density. The 95% quantile in the signal contribution is calculated for each pseudo-experiment determined by integration of the posterior probability distribution; this is taken as the upper limit on the number of possible signal events in the data, for each resonance mass and width hypothesis. This value, divided by the integrated luminosity, provides a measure of the upper limit on the cross-section times acceptance times efficiency times branching ratio for a resonance with that mass and width. This method was also used to determine the expected limits, along with the corresponding 1 and 2 standard deviation (\u03c3) uncertainty bands. The expected limits are evaluated by replacing actual data by pseudo-data generated using the background function determined in the search phase. This limit-setting technique is described in [1] and was used in the previous ATLAS papers [2-4, 8, 11-13, 13, 16, 19].",

The acceptance is typically 40% for the lowest mass point, and increases to 60-90% for the highest mass, depending on the model. The efficiency correction includes various instrumental effects, such as the efficiencies for the trigger, lepton identification and lepton reconstruction efficiencies. A typical efficiency, averaged over the two lepton flavours, is 65-75%, depending on the particle mass and the type of BSM model. The efficiency is somewhat lower (about 50%) for the tbH + channel than for the other models due to a more complex final state leading to fewer isolated leptons.",

These uncertainties cause shifts in the dijet masses by as much as \u00b11.4%. The combined effect from all systematic uncertainties leads to a 6% increase in the limits relative to the limits without uncertainties. This increase is typically within the 1\u03c3 band around the expected limits shown later. The uncertainty associated with the JES and JER dominates the total systematic uncertainty for m jj 2 TeV. At m jj > 2 TeV the uncertainties associated with the background description become comparable. The effect of lepton energy scale uncertainties is found to be negligible. Systematic effects from the lepton trigger, and from lepton identification and reconstruction are taken into account by assigning a constant systematic uncertainty of 1%. This group of uncertainties accounts for differences between data and MC modelling. The effect of the trigger JHEP06(2020)151 on the shape of the m jj distribution is found to be negligible. An additional uncertainty in the limits is associated with variations of the shapes of the m jj signal distributions due to the PDF choice [12]. This arises from the fact that PDF uncertainty affects the angular distributions between the two jets, thus affecting simulated signal shapes used to derive the limits. Such shape-related systematic effects on the m jj distribution are accounted for by assigning a 1% PDF uncertainty to the calculated limits [12]. The PDF uncertainty is found to have a negligible effect on the acceptance corrections, which are dominated by the selection cut on the leptons. The uncertainty of 1.7% in the integrated luminosity is also accounted for.",

To determine if the data deviate significantly from the background-only hypothesis prediction, the BumpHunter[63] test is used. This test calculates the significance of any excess found in mass intervals in all possible locations of the binned m jj . The width of the search window varies from a minimum of two m jj bins up to half the extent of the full m jj mass distribution. For each of the chosen intervals in m jj , a local p-value is calculated from a unique hypothesis test statistic. The method takes into account the lookelsewhere effect[64] by combining each of the hypothesis tests to form a new hypothesis test, and calculating the minimum p-value amongst all tests. A global p-value is then calculated and transformed to a significance assuming that bin-by-bin fluctuations of the data follow a Poisson distribution. Pseudo-experiments are then used to determine the most significant local excess and, finally, a global significance is calculated. A null result from the BumpHunter test can only be used as an indication for non-observation of the searched-for processes but not as the necessary condition. Signal-injection tests using the BumpHunter background-only fit show a lower signal extraction efficiency for wide signals than for the signal-plus-background fit.",

In the region m jj < 2 TeV, the uncertainty related to this alternative function is negligible compared to the statistical variation of the nominal fit. The background shape uncertainty becomes comparable to the size of the statistical variations of the fit function at higher values of m jj . To account for the effects of the fit function choice on the extracted limits, the largest difference in the event yields between the nominal and the alternative background hypothesis is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The possibility of statistical biases related to the choice of functional form used to estimate the background is investigated using a closure test. To do this, pseudo-random distributions were created according to eq. (5.1) with the parameters obtained from the data and allowing bin-by-bin fluctuations. These were fitted using eq. (5.1) plus a Gaussian (signal) component with various fixed mean and width values, similar to what is done in the limit calculations. The distributions of the amplitude of the Gaussian components in these fits have mean values close to zero for all masses and widths, with RMS values indicating a negligible effect on the limits. This was also verified using more complex signal shapes predicted by the H + model. Several theoretical uncertainties associated with the H + model are considered. The uncertainty due to the choice of PDF is found to have a negligible effect on the m jj distribution for H + masses below 2 TeV used for the calculation of limits in this analysis.",
