The Z boson is reconstructed via its decays to electron or muon pairs. The analysed data were recorded in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within the uncertainties. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching fraction, with masses of the new bosons up to 1000 GeV. The results are interpreted in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet model.",

            "text": "Additional Higgs bosons are predicted in several extensions of the SM. Examples of these extensions are the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [7], whose phenomenology is based on the presence of an additional scalar Higgs doublet, and the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [8], which is a particular realisation of the 2HDM. The two Higgs doublets entail the presence of five physical states: two neutral and CP-even bosons (h and H); a neutral and CP-odd boson (A); and two charged scalar bosons (H \u00b1 ). Under particular theoretical assumptions [7], the model is often described by the following parameters: the mass of the CP-even boson H, m H ; the mass of the pseudoscalar A, m A ; the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets, tan \u03b2; the mixing angle \u03b1 between the two CP-even bosons; and the soft-breaking term, m 2 12 . Different couplings of the two doublets to right-handed quarks and charged leptons are predicted in various formulations of the 2HDM: in the Type-I formulation, all fermions couple to only one Higgs doublet; in the Type-II formulation, the up-type quarks couple to a different doublet than the down-type quarks and leptons; in the \"lepton-specific\" formulation, the quarks couple to one of the Higgs doublets and the leptons couple to the other; and in the \"flipped\" formulation, the up-type quarks and leptons couple to one of the Higgs doublets, while the down-type quarks couple to the other.",

Two scenarios are possible. In the conventional scenario, the pseudoscalar is degenerate in mass with the charged scalars and is heavier than the scalar H, thus allowing for the A \u2192 ZH process; while in the twisted [9] scenario, the scalar H is degenerate in mass with the charged scalars and is heavier than the pseudoscalar, thus allowing for the H \u2192 ZA process. Moreover, in the parameter space region where cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) approaches 0, the CPeven h has properties indistinguishable from a SM Higgs boson with the same mass. In this region, known as the alignment limit, the branching fraction of the heavy scalar H to a Z boson and a lighter pseudoscalar A is the largest. The branching fractions for several decay channels of the H and A bosons for m H = 300 GeV and m A = 200 GeV are shown in figure 2 as functions of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) (left) and tan \u03b2 (right).",

The analysis is performed under the assumption of the twisted mass hierarchy scenario, and subsequently extended to the conventional scenario by interchanging the masses of the two bosons. While this is not crucial when setting model independent upper limits, it appears particularly interesting for theoretical interpretation of the results in the context of the 2HDM, since the theoretical cross sections differ in the two scenarios. The search is based on LHC proton-proton (pp) collision data at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .

They are generated at nextto-leading order (NLO) precision in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, the DY, ttV, W+jets, triboson, and part of the diboson background samples are produced with MadGraph5 amc@nlo versions 2.2.2 [18] with the FxFx [19] procedure for NLO jet merging and MadSpin [20] to properly propagate spin information in the matrix element of the process. The tt, single top quark, SM Higgs boson production, and the remaining diboson background samples are produced with powheg version 2 [21][22][23][24][25]. The event generators are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [26] for parton shower and hadronisation. The underlying event tune is CUEPT8M1 [27], derived from the MONASH tune [28]. The NNPDF 3.0 [29] LO and NLO parton distribution functions (PDF) are used. Signal samples of 207 different mass hypotheses are produced for the process H \u2192 ZA \u2192 bb, with m H and m A ranging from 120 to 1000 GeV and from 30 to 1000 GeV, respectively. The choice of the mass hypotheses is strongly motivated by the need of achieving a complete coverage of the parameter space. The spacing between two adjacent mass hypotheses is chosen so as to take into account the worsening of the signal resolution as the mass increases, such that the signal shape can be interpolated with good accuracy over the whole search region. These samples are produced using MadGraph5 amc@nlo version 2.3.2 [18] interfaced with pythia 8.212 [26] for simulation of the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event using the CUEPT8M1 tune [27]. The PDF set used is NNPDF 3.0 [29] at leading order (LO) in the four-flavour scheme, and the factorisation and renormalisation scales are estimated dynamically. The total widths assumed for the H and A resonances are computed with 2HDMC [30]. Finally, the signal simulation does not account for production of the scalar H in association with b jets.",

The leading and subleading transverse momentum (p T ) thresholds applied by the triggers JHEP03 (2020)055are channel dependent, and vary from 17 to 23 GeV (8 to 12 GeV) for the leading (subleading) lepton. Trigger efficiencies are measured with a \"tag-and-probe\" method [38] as a function of lepton p T and \u03b7 in a data control region consisting of Z \u2192 events. Events with two oppositely charged leptons (e \u00b1 e \u2213 , \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) are selected using asymmetric p T requirements, chosen to be above the corresponding trigger thresholds, for the leading and subleading leptons. These requirements are 25 and 15 GeV, respectively, for e \u00b1 e \u2213 events; and 20 and 10 GeV, respectively, for \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 events. Electrons in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and muons in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered. Events with different-flavour leptons (e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) are also selected. The p T requirement for the leading lepton is 25 and 15 (10) GeV for the subleading electron (muon). These events mostly arise from tt production, and this region is used in the final template fit described in section 7 to obtain an estimate of the normalisation of the non-resonant background processes (tt, single top quark, diboson, and triboson) and of the shape of the tt process only. For simplicity, we will refer to events with two electrons, muons, and mixed-flavour leptons as ee, \u00b5\u00b5, and e\u00b5, respectively, throughout this paper.",

The PF candidates include photons, electrons, muons, neutral hadrons, and charged hadrons. The candidate vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects used in this determination are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [40,41] with the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. Electrons, reconstructed by associating tracks with ECAL clusters, are identified by a sequential selection using information on the cluster shape in the ECAL, track quality, and the matching between the track and the ECAL cluster. Additionally, electrons from photon conversions are rejected [42]. Muons are reconstructed from tracks found in the muon system, associated with tracks in the silicon tracking detectors. They are identified based on the quality of the track fit and the number of associated hits in the various tracking detectors [43]. The Rochester correction [44] is applied to the muon momenta to correct for misalignments of the detector or uncertainties in the magnetic field. The lepton isolation, defined as the scalar p T sum of all PF candidates in a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.4 around the lepton, excluding the lepton itself and corrected for contributions from particles not coming from the primary vertex, divided by the lepton p T , is required to be <0.06 for electrons and <0.15 for muons. Here, \u2206R is defined in terms of the track separation in \u03b7 and azimuthal angle (\u03c6, in radians) as \u2206R = (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 . Moreover, the lepton tracks are required to be connected to the primary vertex. Lepton identification and isolation efficiencies in the simulation are corrected for residual differences with respect to data. These corrections are measured in a data sample enriched in Z \u2192 events, using the \"tag-and-probe\" method, and are parameterised as a function of lepton p T and \u03b7.",

Jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, and be JHEP03 (2020)055separated from identified leptons by a distance \u2206R > 0.3. The missing transverse momentum vector, defined as the projection onto the transverse plane relative to the beam axis, of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF candidates, is referred to as p miss T [46,47]. Its magnitude is denoted by p miss T . Corrections to the jet energies are propagated to p miss T . The DeepCSV algorithm [48] is used to identify jets originating from b quarks. Jets are considered as b tagged if they have p T > 20 GeV and they pass the medium working point of the algorithm, which provides around 70% efficiency with a mistag rate of less than 1%, while the mistag rate for c jets is around 10%. Correction factors are applied in the simulation to the selected jets to account for the different response of the DeepCSV algorithm between data and simulation [48].

From the reconstructed objects, we search for resonances in the invariant masses. Specifically, the invariant mass of the A can be reconstructed from the b jet pair; and that of the H from the b jet pair and the lepton pair. Two categories are defined based on the lepton flavours considered: ee and \u00b5\u00b5. The Z mass, reconstructed from two opposite-sign leptons, is used in the selection criteria described in section 4 since it is common to all signals studied in this paper. The masses of the other two particles, H and A, vary according to the signal scenarios considered. Therefore, a simple and effective model independent approach to isolate the signal is to search for an excess of events in the reconstructed m jj and m jj distributions centered around the H and A candidate mass for each signal hypothesis. These distributions for \u00b5\u00b5 + ee events are shown in figure 3, where the background shapes and normalisations are obtained from simulation.",

To account for this mismodeling, given the similar precision of the DY + lightflavour and DY + heavy-flavour jets background samples at simulation level, the observed data-MC discrepancy is fitted with a polynomial function, which is used to reweight each DY + heavy-flavour jets simulated event in the signal region, and a shape uncertainty equal to 100% of the correction is applied.

The search is based on LHC proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . We consider decays such as H \u2192 ZA \u2192 bb, where H and A are the additional CP-even and -odd Higgs bosons above-mentioned, respectively, in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). They are searched for in the mass range from 120 to 1000 GeV for H and 30 to 1000 GeV for A. The search is subsequently extended to the A \u2192 ZH \u2192 bb process via interchanging the two mass parameters.",

Results are also interpreted in the scenario where m H = 379 GeV and m A = 172 GeV. In this context, the region with cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) in the range \u22120.9-0.3 and tan \u03b2 in the range 0.5-7.0 is excluded at 95% confidence level.
