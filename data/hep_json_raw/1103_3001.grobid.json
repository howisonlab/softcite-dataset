            "text": "Electron-positron annihilation at fixed center-of-mass (c.m.) energies has long been a mainstay of research in elementary particle physics. The idea of utilizing initialstate radiation (ISR) to explore e + e \u2212 reactions below the nominal c.m. energies was outlined in Ref. [1], and discussed in the context of high-luminosity \u03c6 and B factories in Refs. [2][3][4]. At high c.m. energies, e + e \u2212 annihilation is dominated by quark-level processes producing two or more hadronic jets. Low-multiplicity processes dominate below or around 2 GeV, and the region near the charm threshold, 3.0-4.5 GeV, features a number of resonances [5]. Thus, studies with ISR events allow us to probe a wealth of physics topics, including cross sections, spectroscopy and form factors. Charmonium and other states with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 can be observed, and intermediate states may contribute to the final state hadronic system. Measurements of their decay modes and branching fractions are important to an understanding of the nature of such states.",

The theoretical predictions of this anomaly rely on these measurements [10]. Improving this prediction requires not only more precise measurements, but also measurements from threshold to the highest c.m. energy possible. In addition, all the important sub-processes should be studied in order to properly incorporate possible acceptance effects. Events produced via ISR at B factories provide independent and contiguous measurements of hadronic cross sections from the production threshold to a c.m. energy of \u223c5 GeV. With more data we also are able to reduce systematic uncertainties in the cross section measurements.",

An important feature of ISR data is that a wide range of energies is scanned continuously in a single experiment, so that no structure is missed, and the relative normalization uncertainties in data from different experiments are avoided. Furthermore, for large values of x the hadronic system is collimated, reducing acceptance issues and allowing measurements down to production threshold. The mass resolution is not as good as the typical beam energy spread used in direct measurements, but resolution and absolute energy scale can be monitored by means of the measured values of the width and mass of well-known resonances, such as the J/\u03c8 produced in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3. Backgrounds from e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons events at the nominal \u221a s 0 and from other ISR processes can be suppressed by a combination of particle identification and kinematic fitting techniques. Studies of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 and several multi-hadron ISR processes using BABAR data have been performed [7,[11][12][13][14][15][16][17], demonstrating the viability of such measurements.

We fit the set of charged-particle tracks to a common vertex and use this as the point of origin in calculating the photon direction(s).

It is dominated by events with a hard \u03c0 0 that results in a fake ISR photon. These events otherwise have kinematics similar to the signal, resulting in the peaking structure at low values of \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 . We evaluate this background in a number of E c.m. ranges by combining the ISR photon candidate with another photon candidate in both data and simulated events, and comparing the \u03c0 0 signals in the resulting \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass distributions. The simulation gives an E c.m. -dependence consistent with the data, so we normalize it using an overall factor. The cross-hatched region in Fig. 1 represents e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K\u03c0\u03b3 events with K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays close to the interaction region, and one pion mis-identified as a kaon. The process has similar kinematics to the signal process, and a contribution of about 1% is estimated using the cross section measured in our previous study [16]. The hatched region represents the contribution from ISR e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events with one or two misidentified pions; this process contributes mainly at low \u03c7 2 values. We estimate the contribution as a function of E c.m. from a simulation using the cross section value and shape from our previous study [13]. All remaining background sources are either negligible or give a \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 distribution that is nearly uniform over the range shown in Fig. 1. We define the signal region by requiring \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 < 30, and estimate the sum of the remaining backgrounds from the difference between the number of data and simulated entries in the control region, 30 < \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 < 60, as shown in Fig. 1. The background contribution to any distribution other than \u03c7 2 is estimated as the difference between the distributions in the relevant quantity for data and MC events from the control region of Fig. 1, normalized to the difference between the number of data and MC events in the signal region. The non-ISR background is subtracted separately. The signal region contains 85598 data and 63784 simulated events; the control region contains 9684 data and 4315 simulated events. ",

We divide the number of reconstructed simulated events in each mass interval by the number generated in that interval to obtain the efficiency shown by the points in Fig. 3(b).

We simulate events with the ISR photon confined to the angular range 20-160 \u2022 with respect to the electron beam in the e + e \u2212 c.m. frame; this angular range is wider than the actual EMC acceptance.

The fraction of selected data events satisfying the tighter requirements differs from the simulated ratio by 1.5%. We take the sum in quadrature of this variation and the 1% model variation (2% total) as the systematic uncertainty due to acceptance and model dependence.  Our data sample contains about 3000 events in the J/\u03c8 peak. Comparing this number with and without selection on \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 we find less than a 1% difference between data and MC simulation due to mis-modeling of the shape of the \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 distribution. This value is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with the \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 selection criterion. To measure tracking efficiency, we consider data and simulated events that contain a highenergy photon and exactly three charged-particle tracks, which satisfy a set of kinematical criteria, including a good \u03c7 2 from a kinematic fit to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hypothesis, assuming one missing pion track in the event.

In Fig. 7(a) the K \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass (two entries per event) shows evidence of the K 1 (1270) and K 1 (1400) resonances, both of which decay into K\u03c1(770), although the latter decay is very weak [5]. In Fig. 7(b) we plot the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass for events with m(",

The K + K \u2212 \u03c1 0 (770) intermediate state makes up the majority of the remainder of the cross section. We exclude a small \u03c6 contribution by requiring |m(K + K \u2212 ) \u2212 m(\u03c6)| > 0.01 GeV/c 2 , and suppress the large K * (892) 0 contribution by means of the anti- Figure 11(a) shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution for the remaining events. The combinatorial background is relatively large, and includes a small contribution from f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. We fit the \u03c1(770) signal with a single BW (mass and width are fixed to 0.77 GeV/c 2 and 0.15 GeV, respectively) and a polynomial background (contribution shown by the hatched area) in each 0.025 GeV c.m. energy interval. The cross section obtained is shown in Fig. 11(b), and has no significant structures except the J/\u03c8 signal. The uncertainty in the \u03c1(770) shape, and also in the background shape, provides the largest contribution to the systematic error, estimated to be 20-30%. A small contribution to the background from f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is ignored in the fit, which does not result in a significant uncertainty. Intermediate states containing narrow resonances can be studied more easily. For the E c.m. energy range below 3.0 GeV, Fig. 12(a) shows a plot of the invariant mass of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair versus that of the K + K \u2212 pair. Horizontal and vertical bands corresponding to the \u03c1 0 (770) and \u03c6, respectively, are visible, and there is a concentration of entries in the \u03c6 band corresponding to the correlated production of \u03c6 and f 0 (980), as demonstrated by the open histogram of Fig. 12(b). The \u03c6 signal is clearly visible in the K + K \u2212 mass projection of Fig. 12(c). The large contribution from the \u03c1(770) is nearly uniform in K + K \u2212 mass, and the cross-hatched histogram shows the non-K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background estimated from the control region in \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 . The cross-hatched histogram also shows a \u03c6 peak, but this is a small fraction of the events. When we subtract this background and fit the remaining data with a double-Gaussian function for the \u03c6 signal, and a first-order polynomial function for the non-\u03c6 background (with a cut-off at the KK threshold), we obtain 3951\u00b191 events corresponding to the \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 intermediate state.",

Comparison with the solid curve in the same figure shows that the model dependence is weak, giving confidence in the efficiency calculation. We calculate the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section as described in Sec. IV C, and divide by the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 branching fraction (0.489 [5]). We show our results as a function of c.m. energy in Fig. 13, and list them in Table IV. The cross section has a peak value of about 0.6 nb at about 1.7 GeV, then decreases with increasing energy until the \u03c6(1020)f 0 (980) threshold, around 2.0 GeV. From this point it rises, falls sharply at about 2.2 GeV, and then decreases slowly. Except in the charmonium region, the results at energies above 3 GeV are not meaningful due to small signals and potentially large backgrounds, and are omitted from Table IV. Figure 13 displays the cross section up to 4.0 GeV in order to show the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) signals, which are discussed in Sec. IX.",

The efficiency is nearly uniform in the cosine of each angle, and so we study the number of events in each interval. We define the \u03c6 production angle, \u0398 \u03c6 , as the angle between the \u03c6 direction and the ISR photon  direction in the rest frame of the \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system (i.e., the effective e + e \u2212 collision axis). The distribution of cos \u0398 \u03c6 , shown in Fig. 14(a), is consistent with the uniform distribution expected if the quasi-two-body final state \u03c6X, X \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , is produced in an S-wave angular-momentum state. We define the pion helicity angle, \u0398 \u03c0 + , as that between the \u03c0 + and the recoil \u03c6 direction in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 rest frame. The kaon helicity angle, \u0398 K + is defined as that between the K + direction and the ISR photon direction in the \u03c6 rest frame. The distributions of cos \u0398 \u03c0 + and cos \u0398 K + , shown in Figs. 14(b) and 14(c), respectively, are consistent with those expected from scalar (uniform) and vector (cos 2 \u0398 K + ) meson decays, where for the latter the \u03c6 retains the helicity of the virtual photon to which the \u03c6X system couples.",

We repeat the analysis just described with the additional requirement that the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass be in the range 0.85-1.10 GeV/c 2 . A fit to the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum for this sample, analogous to that shown in Fig. 12(c), yields about 1350 events; all of these contain a true \u03c6, with a small fraction of events with the pion pair not produced through the f 0 (980), but the latter contribution is relatively small (see discussion in Sec. VII). By selecting events with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass below 0.85 GeV/c 2 , we similarly obtain a sample composed mostly of \u03c6f 0 (600) events. We convert the above two samples of f 0 (980) and f 0 (600) events in each mass interval into measurements of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6(1020)f 0 (980) and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6(1020)f 0 (600) cross sections as described above, dividing by the f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction of 2/3 to account for f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays. The cross sections are shown in Fig. 15 as functions of c.m. energy and are listed in Table V and Table VI. The \u03c6(1020)f 0 (980) cross section behavior near threshold does not appear to be smooth, but is more consistent with a steep rise to a value of about 0.3 nb at 2.0 GeV followed by a slow decrease that is interrupted by a structure around 2.175 GeV. In contrast, the \u03c6(1020)f 0 (600) cross section has a smooth threshold increase to about 0.8 nb, followed by a smooth decrease thereafter, and can be interpreted as the \u03c6(1680) resonance. It is important to note that all structures above 2.0 GeV seen in Fig. 13 relate only to the f 0 (980) resonance. Possible interpretations of these structures are discussed in Sec. VIII. Again, the cross section values are not meaningful for c.m. energy above about 3 GeV, except for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) signals, discussed in Sec. IX.",

From ISR e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03b3\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 events selected with and without the \u03c0 0 from the \u03c9 decay, we find that the simulated efficiency for one \u03c0 0 is too large by (3.0\u00b11.0)%, and we apply a correction of (+6.0 \u00b1 2.0)% because of the two \u03c0 0 s in each event.",

We show the results in Fig. 19 and list the values and statistical errors in Table VII. The cross section rises to a peak value near 0.8 nb at 2 GeV then shows a rapid decrease, which is interrupted by a large J/\u03c8 signal; the charmonium region is discussed in Sec. IX below. The drop at 2.2 GeV is similar to that seen for the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state. Again, the differential luminosity includes corrections for vacuum polarization that should be omitted for calculations of a \u00b5 .  The simulated K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 invariant mass resolution is 8.8 MeV/c 2 in the 1.5-2.5 GeV/c 2 mass range, and increases with mass to 11.2 MeV/c 2 in the 2.5-3.5 GeV/c 2 range. Since less than 20% of the events in a 0.04 GeV interval are reconstructed outside that interval, and the cross section has no sharp structure other than the J/\u03c8 peak, we again make no correction for resolution. The point-to-point systematic uncertainties are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties, and the errors on the normalization are summarized in Table VIII, along with the corrections that were applied to the measurements. The total correction is +8.9%, and the total systematic uncertainty is 7% at low mass, increasing linearly from 7% to 16% above 3 GeV/c 2 .",

Substructure in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 Final State A plot of the invariant mass of the K \u2212 \u03c0 0 pair versus that of the K + \u03c0 0 pair is shown in Fig. 20(a) (two entries per event) for the \u03c7 2 signal region after removing the \u03c6(1020) contribution by |m(K + K \u2212 ) \u2212 m(\u03c6)| > 0.01 GeV/c 2 . Horizontal and vertical bands corresponding to the K * (892) \u2212 and K * (892) + , respectively, are visible. Figure 20(b) shows as points the sum of the two projections of Fig. 20(a); a large K * (892) \u00b1 signal is evident. Fitting this distribution with the function used in Sec. IV E, we obtain the number of events corresponding  to K * (892) \u00b1 (7734 \u00b1 320) and K * (1430) \u00b1 (793 \u00b1 137) production. The K * (1430) \u00b1 :K * (892) \u00b1 ratio is consistent with that obtained for neutral K * production in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, but the number of K * (892) \u00b1 combinations in the peak is larger than the total number of K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events (5522). This indicates the presence of some number of correlated K * (892) + K * (892) \u2212 pairs. Fitting the K \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass distribution in each 0.04 GeV/c 2 bin of K + \u03c0 0 invariant mass, we obtain the number of K * (892) \u2212 and K * (1430) \u2212 events shown in Fig. 21(a,b). The correlated production of K * (892) + K * (892) \u2212 and K * (892) + K * 2 (1430) \u2212 is clearly seen, and the fits yield 1750 \u00b1 60 and 140 \u00b1 49 events, respectively. Note that K * (892) + K * (892) \u2212 accounts for about 30% of all K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events, in contrast with the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, where only 548 \u00b1 263 events (less than 1% of the total) are found to result from the K * (892) 0 K * (892) 0 pair production. We find no evidence for resonance production in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 or K \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 subsystems. Since the statistics are low in any given mass interval, we do not attempt to extract a separate K * (892) + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 + c.c. cross section. The total K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 cross section is roughly a factor of four lower than the K * (892) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + cross section observed in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state. This is consistent with what is expected from isospin considerations and the charged versus neutral K * branching fractions involving charged kaons. The selection of events containing \u03c6(1020) \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays follows that in Sec. IV F. Figure 22(a) shows the plot of the invariant mass of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 pair versus that of the K + K \u2212 pair. The \u03c6 resonance is visible as a vertical band, whose intensity decreases with increasing \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mass except for an enhancement in the f 0 (980) region ( Fig. 22(b)). The \u03c6 signal is also visible in the K + K \u2212 invariant mass projection for events in the control region, shown in Fig. 22(c). The relative non-\u03c6 background is smaller than in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode, but there is a large background from ISR \u03c6\u03c0 0 , \u03c6\u03b7 and/or \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events, as indicated by the control region histogram (hatched) in Fig. 22(c). The contributions from non-ISR and ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events are negligible. Selecting \u03c6 candidate and side band events as for the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode (vertical lines in Figs. 22(a,c)), we obtain the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mass projections shown as the open and cross-hatched histograms, respectively, in Fig. 22(b). Control region events (hatched histogram) are concentrated at low mass values in Fig. 22(b), and a peak corresponding to the f 0 (980) is visible over a relatively low background.",

Possible interpretations are discussed in Section VIII.  is the distribution for simulated K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 events, normalized to the data in the region \u03c7 2 4K < 5 where the relative contributions of the backgrounds and radiative corrections are small. The shaded histogram represents the background from non-ISR e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq events, evaluated as for the other modes. The region defined by the dashed contour represents the background from simulated ISR K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events with at least one charged pion misidentified as a kaon.",

We show the cross section in Fig. 28, and list the measured values in Table X. The cross section increases from threshold to a peak value of about 0.1 nb near 2.7 GeV, then decreases slowly with increasing energy. The only statistically significant narrow structures are the large J/\u03c8 peak and a possible narrow structure near 2.3 GeV, which will be discussed in Sec. VI D. Again, the differential luminosity contribution in each E c.m. interval includes corrections for vacuum polarization that should be omitted for the calculations of a \u00b5 . This measurement supersedes our previous result [13]. The simulated K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 invariant mass resolution is 3.0 MeV/c 2 in the 2.0-2.5 GeV/c 2 range, increasing with mass to 4.7 MeV/c 2 in the 2.5-3.5 GeV/c 2 range, and to about 6.5 MeV/c 2 at higher masses. Since the cross section has no sharp structure except for the J/\u03c8 peak, we again make no correction for resolution. The errors shown in Fig. 28 and listed in Table X are statistical only. The point-to-point systematic uncertainties are much smaller, and the errors on the normalization are summarized in Table XI, along with the corrections applied to the measurements. The total correction is +4.0%, and the total systematic uncertainty is 9% at low mass, linearly increasing to 13% above 3 GeV/c 2 .  pair that is closest to the \u03c6 mass is within \u00b110 MeV/c 2 of the \u03c6 peak, then we include the invariant mass of the other K + K \u2212 combination in Fig. 30(a). Events with K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 mass within \u00b150 MeV/c 2 of the J/\u03c8 mass are excluded. Events within \u00b150 MeV/c 2 of the J/\u03c8 mass are shown as the hatched histogram. The latter is in agreement with results from the BES experiment [31], for which the structures around 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0 GeV/c 2 were studied in detail. For the dots with error bars there is an enhancement at threshold that can be interpreted as being due to f 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay. This is expected in light of the \u03c6f 0 cross sections measured above in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final states, but a contribution from the a 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 can not be excluded. For the combined histograms of Fig. 30(a), we select events with m(K + K \u2212 ) < 1.06 GeV/c 2 (shown as region 1) and calculate a cross section enriched in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) reaction ( Fig. 30(b)). A bump at E c.m. = 2.175 GeV is seen; however, the small number of events and uncertainties in the f 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 lineshape do not allow a meaningful extraction of the cross section for this f 0 (980) decay mode.",

This low mass bump can not be formed by pure three-body phase space. Indeed, the \u03c6(1020)\u03c0\u03c0 threshold is 1.3 GeV, but the observed cross section has a slow rise starting at 1.4 GeV.

Note that the f 0 (980) parameters are consistent with the PDG values [5], indicating that interference with the f 0 (600) (or \u03c0\u03c0 coherent continuum) is minimal. This is expected because events with m(\u03c0\u03c0) < 0.85 GeV/c 2 are associated with the resonance at 1.7 GeV/c 2 in the \u03c6(1020)\u03c0\u03c0 mass, while the f 0 (980) contributes only to a structure above 2 GeV/c 2 (see Fig. 15).

To minimize these uncertainties, we use a BW description for \u03c3 and the Flatt\u00e9 approximation for f 0 to incorporate these two states in a simple model describing the structures in the \u03c6\u03c0\u03c0 cross section data of Fig. 13 (after scaling by a factor of 1.5 to take into account the \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 contribution). The model consists of the incoherent addition of two contributions at each value of E c.m. . The first represents the decay process \u03c6(1680) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (600), with the parameters of the \u03c3 given by Eq.

We note that in Ref. [9] the contribution from \u03c6(1680) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) decay was not taken into account. We see no physical evidence to justify doing this, and so allow the presence of this amplitude in our model. The angular distributions of Fig. 14 are consistent with the \u03c6(1020) and the S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 system being in an S-wave orbital angular momentum state, and so our model includes no centrifugal barrier factor in the amplitude representations.",

In addition, these signals allow checks of our mass scale, and of our measurements of mass resolution.

Figure 38 shows a plot of the invariant mass of a K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 pair versus that of the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system for events with the mass of the K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 pair near the K * (892) 0 mass, i.e., within the bands in Fig. 5(a), but with only one combination plotted in the overlap region. There is a large concentration of entries in the J/\u03c8 band with K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass values near 1.43 GeV/c 2 , but a relatively small number of events in a horizontal band corresponding to the K * 2 (1430) 0 production outside the J/\u03c8 region. We show the K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass projection for the subset of events with K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass within 50 MeV/c 2 of the nominal J/\u03c8 mass in Fig. 39 as the open histogram.

A small signal at the K * (892) 0 indicates the presence of K * (892) 0K * (892) 0 decay of the J/\u03c8; this is also seen as an enhancement in the J/\u03c8 band in Fig. 38. The enhancement at 1.9 GeV/c 2 of Fig. 39 may be due to the 3 F 2 ground state, or to the first radial excitation of the K * 2 (1430), neither of which has been reported previously. Subtracting the number of sideband events from the number in the J/\u03c8 mass window, we obtain 710\u00b130 events with K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass in the range 1.2-1.7 GeV/c 2 , which we take as a measure of J/\u03c8 decay into K * (892) 0 K * 0,2 (1430) 0 . According to Ref. [34], there is an equal contribution from K * 0 (1430) 0 and K * 2 (1430) 0 , which we cannot separate with our selection. We obtain 47 \u00b1 12 events in the 0.8-1.0 GeV/c 2 window for K * (892) 0K * (892) 0 decay, and 185\u00b121 events for decay to K * (892) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + with m(K\u03c0) in the 1.7-2.0 GeV/c 2 region. We convert these to branching fractions using Eq. (10), and divide by the known branching fractions of the K * states [5]. The results are listed in Table XIII, which are more precise than those in Ref. [5]. For the 1.7-2.0 GeV/c 2 mass region we obtain \u0393 J/\u03c8 ee B J/\u03c8\u2192K * (892) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + = (2.24 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b1 0.15) eV. We study decays into \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 using the mass distributions shown in Figs. 40(a),(b). The open histograms are for events with K + K \u2212 mass within the \u03c6 bands of Figs. 12(c) and 22(c). The hatched histogram in Fig. 40(a) is from the \u03c6 sidebands of Fig. 12(c), and represents the dominant background in the \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode. The hatched histogram in Fig. 40(b) is from the \u03c7 2 2K2\u03c0 0 control region, and represents the dominant background in the \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mode. Subtracting these backgrounds, and subtracting a small remaining background using J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) sideband events, we find 181\u00b119 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events, 45\u00b19 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events, and 19\u00b16 \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events. We convert these to branching fractions and, after correcting for the modes other than \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , list them in Table XIII. All are consistent with current PDG values, of which the first two are dominated by our previous measurement.",

Signals at the J/\u03c8 mass are visible in both cases. From Fig. 41(b) we estimate 16 \u00b1 4 \u03c6f 0 events in the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mode. However, \u03c6f 0 (980) is not the dominant mode contributing to J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay. The open histogram of Fig. 42 shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution for events in the J/\u03c8 peak of Fig. 40(a) (|m(K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u2212 m(J/\u03c8)| < 0.05 GeV/c 2 ); events in the J/\u03c8 sidebands (0.05 < |m(K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2212 m(J/\u03c8)| < 0.1 GeV/c 2 ) are shown by the hatched histogram. A two-peak structure is visible that is very similar to that studied by the BES Collaboration [31] and observed in D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay [32]. In both cases the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system is believed to couple to an ss system; both \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distributions exhibit a clear f 0 (980) peak and a broad bump in the 1.3-1.5 GeV/c 2 region. The analysis of Refs. [31,32] shows that this bump is made up of f 2 (1270) and f 0 (1370) contributions; we denote this region by f x . By selecting f 0 (980) in the 0.85-1.10 GeV/c 2 range and f x in the 1.1-1.5 GeV/c 2 range, shown by vertical lines in Fig. 42, and subtracting J/\u03c8 sideband background we find 57 \u00b1 9 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) events and 61 \u00b1 10 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f x events.",

The values obtained are considerably more precise than previous measurements, and cover this low-energy range completely. As such they provide useful input to calculations of the hadronic corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and of the fine structure constant at the Z 0 mass. These final states exhibit complex resonant substructures. For the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state we measure the cross sections for the specific channels e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03c6f 0 , and, for the first time, for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * 2 (1430) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 K + K \u2212 reactions. We also observe signals for the K 1 (1270), K 1 (1400), and f 2 (1270) resonances. It is difficult to disentangle these contributions to the final state, and we make no attempt to do so in this paper. We note that the \u03c1 0 signal is consistent with being due entirely to K 1 decays, and that while the total cross section is dominated by the K * (892) 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + channels, only about 1% of the events correspond to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 K * (892) 0 reaction.",

For the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state we note that the cross section is roughly a factor of four smaller than that for K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 over most of the E c.m. range, consistent with a factor of two isospin suppression of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state and another factor of two for the relative branching fractions of the neutral and charged K * to charged kaons.",

The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 invariant mass distributions both show a clear f 0 (980) signal, and a broad structure at lower mass interpreted as the f 0 (600). We obtain parameter values for these resonances. The \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section measured in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state shows a structure around 1.7 GeV and some structures above 2.0 GeV. The corresponding \u03c6\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 cross section in the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state shows similar behavior. If the f 0 (980) is excluded from the di-pion mass distribution, no structures above 2.0 GeV are seen. We fit the observed cross section with the VMD model assuming \u03c6(1680) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (600) and \u03c6(1680) \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (980) decay; the latter appears to be responsible for the threshold increase of the cross section at 2.0 GeV. Confirming our previous study [7], our data require an additional resonance at 2.175 GeV, which we call the Y (2175), with decay to \u03c6f 0 (980), but not to \u03c6f 0 (600). Further investigation reveals consistent results for the K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 final state, and clear Y (2175) signals in the K + K \u2212 f 0 (980) channels, with f 0 (980)\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . This structure can be interpreted as a strange partner (with c-quarks replaced by s-quarks) of the Y (4260) [35], which has the analogous decay mode J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , or perhaps as an ssss state that decays predominantly to \u03c6f 0 .",
