The LArTPC promises excellent background rejection capabilities, especially in this \"golden\" channel for both short and long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. We present the first experimental observation of electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos in the ArgoNeut LArTPC, in the energy range relevant to DUNE and the Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino Program. We have selected 37 electron candidate events and 274 gamma candidate events, and measured an 80% purity of electrons based on a topological selection. Additionally, we present a of separation of electrons from gammas using calorimetric energy deposition, demonstrating further separation of electrons from background gammas.",

The \u03c0 0 mesons decay preferentially into pairs of energetic gammas. These gammas are hundreds of MeV for the Booster Neutrino Beam [16,20,21], for example. A gamma, at typical neutrino beam energies, converts primarily through pair production -see Figure 1. Gammas can appear almost identical to electrons in most neutrino detector technologies, especially in the case that the two electromagnetic showers overlap or one of the gammas escapes the detector before interacting. A successful measurement of CP violation and resolution of short-baseline anomalies in neutrino physics requires high discrimination power between electron neutrinos and high energy gamma backgrounds.",

However, the small interaction rate of neutrinos, coupled with the small oscillation amplitudes for oscillations, means the available sample of electron neutrinos in data is small compared to backgrounds. This makes maximizing the detection of electron neutrinos and suppression of background signals essential. Liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) [22,23] technology provides excellent electron neutrino detection and electron/gamma separation. The primary method of discrimination between electrons and gammas exploits the radiation length (X 0 = 14 cm) in argon, which is large compared to the excellent spatial resolution of TPCs. This means that a gamma can leave a visible gap between its origin and the place in the TPC where it interacts. For an electron originating from a CC \u03bd e interaction no such gap will be present. This paper applies this topological selection to identify a pure sample of low energy electron neutrino events in a liquid argon time projection chamber. Figure 1. The cross section of high energy gammas on argon between 1 MeV and 1 GeV. Most gammas produced by neutrino interactions relevant to DUNE [9] and the SBN Program [16] are in this region. Here, \u03ba refers to the pair production cross section for the nuclear field and electron field. Pair production becomes the dominant cross section above 10 MeV.

Further, the hadronic activity at the neutrino interaction vertex could be invisible in the TPC data, either because it consists of only neutral particles or because the particles are below detection threshold. Without the presence of hadronic activity to distinguish the neutrino interaction vertex, it is not possible to observe a gap. In these cases, a second method of electron/gamma discrimination is possible which uses calorimetry at the start of the electromagnetic (EM) shower. An electron produces ionization consistent with a single ionizing particle, whereas the electron/positron pair produced by a gamma conversion produces ionization consistent with two single ionizing particles. The calorimetric discrimination of electrons from gammas through the measure of ionization at the beginning of the electromagnetic shower is frequently referred to as dE/dx discrimination.",

In Section V, we describe the details of the electromagnetic shower reconstruction and comparison of the electromagnetic showers to single particle Monte Carlo simulation of electrons and photons. More details about the shower reconstruction algorithms are available in Appendix A. As a validation of the electromagnetic shower reconstruction, we find that the most probable value of ionization at the beginning of an electron-induced electromagnetic shower is 1.76 \u00b1 0.02 MeV/cm, in agreement with the theoretical value. Based upon comparison with the single particle Monte Carlo, the topological selection produced a sample of electron neutrino candidates that was 80% \u00b1 15% pure.",

Finally, in Section VII we provide a demonstration of the calorimetric separation of electrons and photons through the dE/dx discrimination.

For more details on the construction and operation of the Ar-goNeuT detector see [28]. The NuMI beamline [31] is the higher energy of the two neutrino beams produced at Fermilab. The beam is capable of running in neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, depending on the polarity of the magnetic field applied in the focusing magnetic horn system. During the ArgoNeuT data taking, NuMI was running in the low energy mode, with the mean energy E \u03bd\u00b5 = 9.6 GeV, E\u03bd \u00b5 = 3.6 ( E \u03bd\u00b5 = 4.3 GeV in neutrino mode). Although the beam consists mainly of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos there is a small (\u223c2%) contamination of electron neutrino and anti-neutrino events, with an energy spectrum shown in Figure 2. This allows the study of electron neutrino interactions. Data presented here were taken in both neutrino (8.5e18 protons on target (POT) ) and anti-neutrino mode (1.20e20 POT).",

When the 240 waveforms of the wires of each plane are juxtaposed, and a color scheme is applied, an event can be visualized as seen in Figures 5 and 6. Due to the low interaction rate of neutrinos, events are typically empty (no significant ionization of any kind), and the next most common event contains externally produced particles, such as crossing muons from upstream interactions.

That is, a shower has many hits reconstructed as it travels through the TPC, whereas a track generally has one charge deposition detected per step through the TPC. Measuring the hit density along a particle, defined as hits per unit distance, can thus discriminate between tracks and showers. Since hits are only reconstructed on wires, the hit density is corrected to account for the fact that high angle tracks and showers (more parallel to the wires) have relatively fewer hits reconstructed. Figure 3 shows these separation parameters obtained using Monte Carlo simulations of single electrons as a model for electromagnetic showers, and single muons and protons as an archetype for tracks. The Monte Carlo for this analysis is a GEANT4 based Monte Carlo through the LArSoft package, and we simulate single particles isotropically in the detector to determine separation properties [32,37]. To select electromagnetic showers, a cut is made on the value of log(1 \u2212 E.V. P CA ) > \u22125 (see Figure 3 (top)). E.V. P CA is the first eigenvalue of the PCA analysis. This corresponds to rejecting all clusters that have a principal eigenvalue greater than \u223c0.999. A second cut is made on the corrected hit density to reject track-like events.

This suppresses the \u03bd \u00b5 charged current events in which the muon radiates significantly.

A signal peak finding algorithm is then used to find charge depositions on each wire, reconstructed as hits. The integral of the ADC count in each hit is used to calculate the charge dQ using an (ADC\u00d7Timetick)/Charge conversion constant. These constants are obtained using throughgoing muon events in a way analogous to [30], for every wire individually, on both collection and induction planes. To determine the constants, all of the muon hits (from a separate analysis) on each wire are fit with a Gaussianconvolved Landau distribution.

Once the shower develops, the electron and gamma populations become significantly less distinguishable (see Appendix B). The details and validation of the electromagnetic shower reconstruction algorithms are available in Appendix A. For the calorimetric separation of electrons and gammas to succeed, the dE/dx metric for each electromagnetic shower must be well reconstructed. As the charge depositions are measured discretely in 2D on single wires, in each of the wire planes we use the 3D axis of the shower to calculate an \"effective\" pitch (dx) between hits. This effective pitch is, in other words, the real distance in the TPC that a particle travels between its two projections (hits) on adjacent wires. Figure 8 shows the distributions of effective pitches for the electron and gamma samples. The effective pitch is at least the wire spacing, which is 0.4 cm in ArgoNeuT. The gamma distribution shows a slightly higher effective pitch, which is expected from Figure 18 showing that the gammas are at slightly higher angles to the wire planes than the electron sample. In the calculation of dE/dx, the effective pitch is used as the estimate of dx. A valuable cross-check is the distribution of every dE/dx deposition measured at the start of the shower. Figure 9 shows the distributions for the Monte Carlo single particle simulation of both electrons and gammas. The electron hits follow a Gaussian-convolved Landau distribution peaked at the dE/dx value corresponding to one single ionizing particle. The gamma distribution peaks at a value corresponding to two single ionizing particles, but is more complicated due to the presence of gammas that Compton scatter instead of pair producing (seen at approximately 2 MeV/cm in Figure 9).",

Since the gamma sample is produced entirely by selecting showers that are displaced from the neutrino interaction vertex, the purity of the gamma sample is taken to be nearly 100% in this analysis. The Monte Carlo sample is a sample of single gammas produced with a Gaussian energy distribution, with the distribution tuned to best match data gamma distribution. This tuning does not significantly affect the Monte Carlo distributions of dE/dx except to change the relative proportions of the Compton and pair production populations. Since the Monte Carlo is known to imperfectly model the data (single particle vs. neutrino induced gammas), a shape-only comparison is presented with area normalized distributions. There is some disagreement in shape, particularly at the Compton population and the peak of the pair production population. However, the data does appear to represent the Monte Carlo and the \u03c7 2 /dof goodness of fit, based on the statistical uncertainties of the data distribution between 0 and 8 MeV/cm, is 1.4. For the electron sample, we can not assume that the purity of the sample is 100% based on topology alone. As seen in Figure 4, a nonnegligible amount of gammas will convert at a sufficiently short distance that they will be selected as electrons in a topological based cut. Hadronic activity at the neutrino interaction vertex can also obscure the presence of a gap from a gamma. Therefore, the distribution of electron-like dE/dx hits analogous to Figure 10 is expected to be modeled by a combination of electron and gamma showers in Monte Carlo.",

            "text": "The electron and gamma distributions from Figure 9 are used to fit the equivalent distribution of the electron-candidate data sample, using a linear combination of electron and gamma Monte Carlo such that the normalization of the total Monte Carlo distribution is normalized, consistent with the data distribution. The \u03c7 2 /dof is minimized between the (area normalized) data distribution and the combination of the electron and gamma distributions from Monte Carlo. The best fit is shown in Figure 11. The \u03c7 2 /dof decreases from 2.78 with no gamma contamination to 1.02 when a gamma contamination is included at 20 \u00b1 15%, based on the data statistical uncertainties alone, and over the range of 0 to 8 MeV/cm. The 15% uncertainty is calculated as the width of the \u03c7 2 /dof distribution at \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1. This represents a direct measurement of the misidentification rate of the topological selection of electrons for this particular analysis, and demonstrates a method to measure this mis-ID rate in future electron neutrino searches in LArTPCs. As a final verification of the reconstruction, the measured distribution for the electron candidates is corrected by subtracting the gamma distribution from Figure 11, scaled by the 20% found above, using the gamma distribution from data. This background subtracted distribution is fit with a Gaussian-convolved Landau distri-bution to determine the most probable value of charge deposition. In particular, the most probable value of dE/dx for electron-like hits is consistent with the theoretical values as shown in Figure 12. For electrons above 100 MeV/c, as this sample is, the theoretical expectation of the most probable ionization is 1.77 MeV/cm. This is in good agreement with the fitted value of 1.76 \u00b1 0.02 MeV/cm, where the error is computed from the covariance matrix of the fit parameters (again, statistical uncertainty only). ",

As a validation, we have studied the kinematic behavior of the electron-candidate sample. Due to the small active volume of the ArgoNeuT detector, the electromagnetic showers are poorly contained and the initial electron energy is not a measurable quantity. Instead, we measure the distribution of reconstructed deposited energy, and we compare it to a simulation of electron neutrino events. The flux used to simulate the electron neutrino events is computed with a simulation of the NuMI beam with FLUKA [33]. The electron neutrino and anti-neutrino flux for NuMI in anti-neutrino mode is shown in Figure 2( E\u03bd e = 4.3 GeV, E \u03bde = 10.5). The electron neutrino and anti-neutrino flux is predominately electron anti-neutrinos. Figure 13 shows the kinematic distribution of the electron events' deposited energy and angle \u03b8, both calculated as described in Appendix A. Both the deposited energy and reconstructed angle are area normalized independently for both data and simulation. In both distributions, the data has not been corrected to account for the 20% contamination of gammas, whereas the simulation does not include any gamma contamination. Despite this discrepancy, the distributions are presented as a demonstration that the electron candidate sample is well modeled by the Monte Carlo, despite the low statistics and other deficiencies.",

In considering the ionization at the start of a gamma induced shower where an electron and positron pair are present, we assume the ionization clouds of the two particles are sufficiently separated such that a non-linear model incorrectly inflates the dE/dx from a dQ/dx, for higher values of dQ/dx. Thus, the dE/dx separation is computed using a minimally ionizing particle scale recombination correction for all charge depositions at the beginning of the shower in the electron and gamma samples. While this is not applicable for highly ionizing fluctuations, it prevents an over estimation of the dE/dx of gammas which artificially inflates the calorimetric separation power. If the non-linear model of recombination was used, it would result in a photon peak at 20% higher dE/dx, according to the parameterization in [38].",

For this analysis, when computing the dE/dx separation metric for a shower all of the hits within a rectangle of 4 cm along the direction of the shower and 1 cm perpendicular to the shower are collected, and the median is computed.

Despite the low statistics of the ArgoNeuT experiment, the electron and gamma separation using calorimetry is clearly validated. For example, when a cut is made at 2.9 MeV/cm we find a 76 \u00b1 7% efficiency for selecting electron candidate events in data with a 7 \u00b1 2% contamination from the gamma sample. Here, the uncertainties on the efficiency are estimated with the Feldman-Cousins method [40] and are statistical only. It must be noted, however, that the sample of electron candidates in this figure is not background subtracted. The efficiency to select electrons with the same cut at 2.9 MeV/cm, estimated with the Monte Carlo, is 91%. This is consistent with the above measurement that 20 \u00b1 15% of the electron candi- date sample, selected by topology only, is in fact gammas.

For each event, the true energy depositions are binned into \"hits\" with a pitch that corresponds to the pitch of the simulated shower on the collection plane. Then, the three dE/dx metrics above are computed for the true hits, and this processes is repeated while varying the length of the shower used in the dE/dx calculation. The number of hits used in the calculation is a function of the distance along the shower, from the start and moving along the axis of the shower, from which the hits are collected. The distance used is varied from 2 cm up to 20 cm, with a width of 1 cm. It was found that a width 1 cm was sufficient to collect the hits along the trunk of the shower. The results are provided in Figure 19, which show that the median metric is the most robust over a variety of distances used at the start of the shower. Give this result, the median is chosen as the optimal metric for this paper.",

Based upon the quality of the match between the projection and the 2D slopes, the 3D axis is adjusted until the best fit is obtained -see Figure 16. An initial guess, the arrow in black, is made for the start direction based on the 2D start directions (red arrows in each plane). The start direction in 3D is projected into each plane, and the error in the 3D start direction is calculated. An additional set of 3D directions (gray arrows) are also projected into each plane. If the central direction (in black) is chosen as the best fit direction, the angular separation between it and the other (gray) directions is decreased and the algorithm repeats. This procedure is repeated until the algorithm can no longer improve the accuracy of the 3D start direction.",

However, for this analysis, the poor resolution in a few measurements of the 3D axis has a minimal effect on the dE/dx calculation. This is due to the fact that the majority of the events are While investigating the methods to convert a sample of hits (per shower) into a single variable, three promising dE/dx metrics were developed:",
