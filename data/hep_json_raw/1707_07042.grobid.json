The decays \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 are observed for the first time with statistical significances of 9.6\u03c3, 13.4\u03c3 and 7.5\u03c3, respectively. The branching fractions are determined to be B(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (2.19 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , B(\u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (4.76 \u00b1 0.56 \u00b1 0.38) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , B(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 ) = (8.92 \u00b1 0.84 \u00b1 0.65) \u00d7 10 \u22125 and B(\u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 ) = (2.27\u00b10.43\u00b10.25)\u00d710 \u22125 , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The precision for the measurement of B(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 ) is significantly improved compared to previous measurements. Based on the measured branching fractions, the role played by the doubly and singly Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka disconnected transition amplitudes for \u03c7c0,2 decays into pseudoscalar meson pairs can be clarified.",

            "text": "During the past decades an enormous number of decay channels have been measured for J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) Note * . It can be attributed to the accumulation of high statistics of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) events which can be accessed directly in e + e \u2212 annihilations. As a result, many interesting properties associated with the strong decays of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) have been investigated and will advance our knowledge about the strong QCD in the interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative strong interaction regime. In contrast, little is known about the \u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) decays since they can not be produced directly in e + e \u2212 annihilation due to spin-parity conservation. In Ref. [1] it was argued that the ratio of the decay branching fractions between J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f 0 (1710) and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 (1710) [2] encodes the production mechanisms of light quark contents via the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule violations. In Refs. [3,4] parametrization schemes were proposed in order to further understand the OZI rule violating mechanisms in the two-body decays of \u03c7 cJ to SS, P P and V V (S = scalar, P = pseudoscalar, V = vector). It was shown that apart from the singly OZI (SOZI) disconnected process, the doubly OZI (DOZI) disconnected process may play a crucial role in the production of isospin-0 light meson pairs, for instance, in \u03c7 cJ \u2192 f 0 f \u2032 0 , \u03c9\u03c9, \u03c6\u03c6, \u03c9\u03c6, \u03b7\u03b7, \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 . By defining the relative strength r between the DOZI and SOZI violating amplitudes in addition to several other physical quantities in the SU(3) flavor basis, insights into the mechanisms for producing light meson pairs in charmonium decays can be gained.",

As for \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 P P decays, most of them have been well measured except for the processes with final states containing an \u03b7 \u2032 meson. Until now, only the branching fraction of \u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 is available with poor precision, while no obvious signals for \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 are observed [2]. It is worth noting that according to Eq. 15 in Ref. [3] the calculation of r is more sensitive to the branching fractions of \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 than those of \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 [3,4].

There is a superconducting solenoid magnet surrounding the electromagnetic calorimeter, providing a 1 Tesla (0.9 Tesla during 2012 data taking) magnetic field. The details of the BESIII detector can be found in Ref. [9]. The BESIII detector is simulated by the GEANT4-based [10] simulation software BOOST [11], which includes the geometric and material description of the BESIII detector, the detector response and digitization models, as well as a record of the detector running conditions and performances. The production of the \u03c8(3686) resonance is simulated by the Monte Carlo (MC) generator KKMC [12], in which the effects of beam energy spread and initial state radiation are considered. Known decays are generated by EVTGEN [13] using branching fractions quoted by the particle data group (PDG) [2], and the remaining un-known decays are generated with LUNDCHARM [14]. The transition of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ is assumed to be a pure E1 process [15].

The overall probability density functions in fitting include three components: the \u03c7 c0,2 signals, the \u03c7 c1 peaking background for specific modes, and the non-peaking background. In the fit, the \u03c7 c0,2 signals are described with the MC-simulated shape of histogram convolved with a Gaussian function to compensate for the potential resolution difference between data and MC simulation. Due to limited-size of data sample, the parameters of the Gaussian function are fixed to those obtained from control samples, such as \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,2 with \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0,2 with \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), which have similar final states of interest. The shape of the \u03c7 c1 peaking background for the specific modes are described with the MC simulation of the corresponding background modes, and their magnitudes are floated.

The detection efficiencies \u01eb, the \u03c7 c0,2 signal yields in the different decay modes, and the resultant decay branching fractions are summarized in Table I, where the signal yields in each decay mode are calculated according to the total number N \u03c8(3686) of \u03c8(3686) events, the detection efficiency and the product branching fractions in the subsequent decay.

The systematic uncertainty from the total number of \u03c8(3686) events, estimated by measuring inclusive hadronic events, is 0.7% [7,8]. The uncertainty from MDC tracking and photon detection have been studied with the high purity control sample of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 l + l \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0. The difference in the detection efficiency between data and MC simulation is less than 1% per charged track, which is taken as the systematic uncertainty [7]. Employing a method similar to that in Ref. [18], except using a larger J/\u03c8 data set [19], the difference of the photon detection efficiency between data and MC simulation is determined to be within 0.5% in the barrel and 1.5% in the endcaps of the EMC. In this analysis, the weighted uncertainty is 0.6% per photon by considering the photon angular distribution. The uncertainty due to \u03b7 reconstruction is determined by using a high purity control sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7pp decays. The difference of \u03b7 reconstruction efficiencies between data and MC simulation, about 1.0% per \u03b7 [20], is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty from the \u03b7 \u2032 mass window requirement is estimated by changing the \u03b7 \u2032 signal windows by one unit of the mass resolution. The resultant difference in the branching fractions is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty related to the kinematic fit is due to the inconsistency between data and MC simulation of the track parameters and their error matrices. In this work, only charged pions are involved and their track parameters in MC simulation are corrected by using the control sample \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 . As a consequence, the consistency between data and MC simulation is significantly improved. The difference of the detection efficiencies with and without the correction is taken as the uncertainty due to the kinematic fit. The detailed method to estimate the uncertainty of the kinematic fit can be found in Ref. [21]. The uncertainty in the fit arises from resolution compensation, fit range and background shape. The resolution compensation uncertainty is obtained by changing the width of Gaussian function to the most conservative value estimated by the different control samples. The uncertainties from fit range and background shape are estimated by shifting up or down the fit intervals by 10 MeV/c 2 and by changing the order of the Chebychev polynomial function, respectively. Summing the maximum uncertainties of each aspect in quadrature yields the uncertainty from the fit. The uncertainty from decay branching fractions of intermediate states in the subsequent decays is determined by setting the branching fractions, B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ ), B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), and B(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), randomly according to the Gaussian distributions, where the means and standard deviations of Gaussian functions are taken to be their central values of the branching fractions and the corresponding uncertainties in the PDG [2]. We repeat the same fitting process 100 times, and the standard deviations of the resultant branching fractions are taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty arising from the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X background subtraction is estimated by changing the \u03c0 0 mass window |M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 M \u03c0 0 | by \u00b11 MeV/c 2 in the event selection. Similarly, the uncertainty related to \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 is estimated by changing the J/\u03c8 mass window |M recoil \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2212 M J/\u03c8 | by 1 MeV/c 2 . The uncertainty arising from the veto \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 with J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 is estimated by shifting the J/\u03c8 mass window by \u00b11 MeV/c 2 .",

The branching fraction of the decay \u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 is also measured with improved precision. Table I summarizes the measured branching fractions of \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 . With the measured branching fractions, the relative strength r between the DOZI and SOZI violating amplitudes for the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 decays to P P final states, is estimated to be around \u22120.15 according to Eq. (15) in Ref. [3] with its input parameters. This implies that the contribution from the DOZI violating amplitude is suppressed in \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 P P decays in comparison with the SOZI ones [3,4]. In addition, we find B(\u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 )/B(\u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2248 45, which is about one order larger than the ratios for other pseudoscalar meson pairs, ranging from 3 to 6 for \u03c0",
