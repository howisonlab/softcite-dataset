The ratio of the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de to J=\u03c8 cross sections is also reported for jyj < 1.2, over the range 10 < p T < 100 GeV. These are the highest p T values for which the cross sections and ratio have been measured.",

            "text": "Studies of heavy-quarkonium production are of central importance for an improved understanding of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1]. The nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective-field-theory framework [2], arguably the best formalism at this time, factorizes high-p T quarkonium production in short-distance and long-distance scales. First, a heavy quark-antiquark pair, QQ, is produced in a Fock state 2S\u00fe1 L \u00bda J , with spin S, orbital angular momentum L, and total angular momentum J that are either identical to (color singlet, a \u00bc 1) or different from (color octet, a \u00bc 8) those of the corresponding quarkonium state. The QQ cross sections are determined by short-distance coefficients (SDCs), kinematic-dependent functions calculable perturbatively as expansions in the strong-coupling constant \u03b1 s . Then this \"preresonant\" QQ pair binds into the physically observable quarkonium through a nonperturbative evolution that may change L and S, with bound-state formation probabilities proportional to long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). The LDMEs are conjectured to be constant (i.e., independent of the QQ momentum) and universal (i.e., process independent). The color-octet terms are expected to scale with powers of the heavy-quark velocity in the QQ rest frame. In the nonrelativistic limit, an S-wave vector quarkonium state should be formed from a QQ pair produced as a color singlet ( 3 S \u00bd1 1 ) or as one of three color octets ( 1 S \u00bd8 0 , 3 S \u00bd8 1 , and 3 P \u00bd8 J ).",

The disagreement stems from the fact that different sets of measurements were considered. In particular, the results crucially depend on the minimum p T of the fitted measurements [6], because the octet SDCs have different p T dependences. Fits including low-p T cross sections lead to the conclusion that, at high p T , quarkonium production should be dominated by transversely polarized octet terms. This prediction is in stark contradiction with the unpolarized production seen by the CDF [7,8] and CMS [9,10] experiments, an observation known as the \"quarkonium polarization puzzle.\" As shown in Ref. [6], the puzzle is seemingly solved by restricting the NRQCD global fits to high-p T quarkonia, indicating that the presently available fixed-order calculations provide SDCs that are unable to reproduce reality at lower p T values or that NRQCD factorization only holds for p T values much larger than the quarkonium mass. The polarization measurements add a crucial dimension to the global fits because the various channels have remarkably distinct polarization properties: in the helicity frame",

They complement other prompt charmonium cross sections measured at the LHC, by ATLAS [14,15], LHCb [16,17], and ALICE [18]. The analysis is made in four bins of absolute rapidity (jyj < 0.3, 0.3 < jyj < 0.6, 0.6 < jyj < 0.9, and 0.9 < jyj < 1.2) and in the p T ranges 10-95 GeV for the J=\u03c8 and 10-75 GeV for the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de. A rapidity-integrated result in the range jyj < 1.2 is also provided, extending the p T reach to 120 GeV for the J=\u03c8 and 100 GeV for the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de. The corresponding \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de over J=\u03c8 cross section ratios are also reported. The dimuon invariant mass distribution is used to separate the J=\u03c8 and \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de signals from other processes, mostly pairs of uncorrelated muons, while the dimuon decay length is used to separate the nonprompt charmonia, coming from decays of b hadrons,from the prompt component.

The efficiency of the dimuon vertex fit \u03c7 2 probability requirement is also measured with the T&P approach, using a sample of events collected with a dedicated (prescaled) trigger. It is around 95%-97%, improving with increasing p T , with a 2% systematic uncertainty. At high p T , when the two muons might be emitted relatively close to each other, the efficiency of the dimuon trigger \u03f5 \u03bc\u03bc is smaller than the product of the two single-muon efficiencies [13], \u03f5 \u03bc\u03bc \u00bc \u03f5 \u03bc 1 \u03f5 \u03bc 2 \u03c1. The correction factor \u03c1 is evaluated with MC simulations, validated from data collected with singlemuon triggers. For p T < 35 GeV, \u03c1 is consistent with being unity, within a systematic uncertainty estimated as  FIG. 1 (color online).

These acceptances are calculated using a detailed MC simulation of the CMS experiment. Charmonia are generated using a flat rapidity distribution and p T distributions based on previous measurements [13]; using flat p T distributions leads to negligible changes. The particles are decayed by EVTGEN [25] interfaced to PYTHIA 6.4 [26], while PHOTOS [27] is used to simulate final-state radiation. The fractions of J=\u03c8 and \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de dimuon events in a given \u00f0jyj; p T \u00de bin with both muons surviving the fiducial selections depend on the decay kinematics and, in particular, on the polarization of the mother particle. Acceptances are calculated using polarization scenarios corresponding to different values of the polar anisotropy parameter in the helicity frame, \u03bb HX \u03d1 : 0 (unpolarized), \u00fe1 (transverse), and \u22121 (longitudinal). A fourth scenario, corresponding to \u03bb HX \u03d1 \u00bc \u00fe0.10 for the J=\u03c8 and \u00fe0.03 for the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de, reflects the results published by CMS [10]. The two other parameters characterizing the dimuon angular distributions [28], \u03bb \u03c6 and \u03bb \u03d1\u03c6 , have been measured to be essentially zero [10] and have a negligible influence on the acceptance. The acceptances are essentially identical for the two charmonia and are almost rapidity independent for jyj < 1.2. The two-dimensional acceptance maps are calculated with large MC simulation samples, so that statistical fluctuations are small, and in narrow jyj bins, so that variations within the bins can be neglected. Since the efficiencies and acceptances are evaluated for events where the two muons bend away from each other, a factor of 2 is applied to obtain the final cross sections.",

The numerical values, including the relative statistical and systematic uncertainties, are reported for both charmonia, five rapidity intervals, and four polarization scenarios in Tables 1-4 of the Supplemental Material [29]. Figure 2 shows the results obtained in the unpolarized scenario. With respect to the jyj < 0.3 bin, the cross sections drop by \u22485% for 0.6 < jyj < 0.9 and \u224815% for 0.9 < jyj < 1.2. Measuring the charmonium production cross sections in the broader rapidity range jyj < 1.2 has the advantage that the increased statistical accuracy allows the measurement to be extended to higher-p T values, where comparisons with theoretical calculations are particularly informative. Figure 3 compares the rapidity-integrated (unpolarized) cross sections, after rescaling with the branching fraction B of the dimuon decay channels [30], with results reported by ATLAS [14,15]. The curve represents a fit of the J=\u03c8 cross section measured in this analysis to a power-law function [31]. The band labeled FKLSW represents the result of a global fit [6] comparing SDCs calculated at NLO [3] with \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de cross sections and polarizations previously reported by CMS [10,13] and LHCb [17]. According to that fit, \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de mesons are produced predominantly unpolarized. At high p T , the values reported in this Letter tend to be higher than the band, which is essentially determined from results for p T < 30 GeV.",
