This search uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant deviation from the expectation of the Standard Model backgrounds is observed. Assuming the Standard Model Z H production cross-section, an observed (expected) upper limit of 67% (39%) at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio of invisible decays of the Higgs boson with mass m H = 125 GeV. The corresponding limits on the production cross-section of the Z H process with the invisible Higgs boson decays are also presented. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the dark matter candidate and mediator masses are reported in the framework of simplified dark matter models.",

In the SM, the invisible decay of the Higgs boson (H \u2192 Z Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bd) has a branching ratio B H\u2192inv of 1.06 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for m H = 125 GeV [3]. A larger B H\u2192inv can exist in many extensions of the SM. For example, a Higgs boson can decay to light neutralinos [4,5], graviscalars in extradimension models [6,7], Majorons [8][9][10], neutrinos [8,11,12], or dark matter (DM) through the Higgs portal model [13,14]. Observation of a B H\u2192inv significantly above the SM value would give a strong indication for physics beyond the SM (BSM).",

One of the hypotheses assumes that DM is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [15] that are nearly invisible to particle detectors. Experiments at the LHC can search for WIMPs produced in association with a detectable final state, and provide sensitive constraints on low-mass WIMP production [16][17][18]. Moreover, models with a sizable B H\u2192inv often involve a Higgs boson decaying into WIMPs, and thus, studying B H\u2192inv gives a unique probe into DM through its coupling to the Higgs boson.",

These background processes can result in the + E miss T final state with at least one boson decaying leptonically. Production of Z Z events is modelled with Powheg-Box v2 and gg2vv3.1.6 [58,59] for the quark-antiquark (qq Z Z ) and gluongluon (gg Z Z ) initial states, respectively. The qq Z Z and gg Z Z events are described at NLO and LO QCD accuracies, respectively. The qq Z Z production cross-section is corrected to NNLO QCD and NLO EW precision using K-factors binned in the invariant mass of the Z Z system, provided by the authors of Refs. [60,61]. The QCD and EW corrections to the qq Z Z cross-section are assumed to factorise, as suggested in Ref. [62]. In addition, the gg Z Z production cross-section is scaled to account for the NLO QCD correction [63]. The W Z and W W processes are generated with Powheg-Box v2, and their production cross-sections are predicted at NLO in QCD. All the diboson events are generated with the CT10 PDF set and showered using Pythia8.186 with the AZNLO tune. Generated events are processed through the ATLAS detector simulation [66] based on GEANT4 [67]. Additional pp collisions in the same proton bunch crossing (pile-up) are simulated with Pythia8.186 and overlaid to simulated events to mimic the real collision environment. The distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing in the simulation is weighted to reflect that in data. Simulated events are processed with the same reconstruction algorithms as for the data. Furthermore, the lepton momentum scale and resolution, the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies, and the trigger efficiencies in the simulation are corrected to match that measured in data.",

Additional requirements using the track and vertex information inside a jet [74] are applied for jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 to suppress pile-up contributions. Candidate b-jets (p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5) are identified with an algorithm providing 85% signal efficiency and a rejection factor of 33 for light-flavor jets [75]. The E miss T vector is computed as the negative of the vector sum of transverse momenta of all the leptons and jets, as well as the tracks originating from the primary vertex but not associated with any of the leptons or jets (\"soft-term\") [76]. Usage of the track-based soft-term, rather than the calorimeter-based one, minimises the impact of pile-up on the E miss T reconstruction. Events are required to have a collision vertex associated with at least two tracks each with p T > 0.4 GeV. Candidate events must have exactly two selected electrons or muons with opposite charges and p T > 20 GeV, and the leading lepton is further required to have p T > 30 GeV. To suppress the W Z background, events that contain an extra \"soft\" lepton are rejected, where the soft leptons satisfy the corresponding \"loose\" identification criteria and all other lepton selection criteria. The dilepton invariant mass (m ) is required to be in the range between 76 and 106 GeV to reject background processes with two leptons that do not originate from the prompt decay of a Z boson (non-resonant-).",

In addition, a requirement of m W T > 60 GeV is imposed in the control region to suppress non-W Z contributions, where m W T is constructed from the third lepton's momentum and the E miss T vector.

Backgrounds are reduced by removing events with extra leptons or any jets containing b-hadrons (\"b-jets\") and by requiring a boosted Z boson which is back to back with the missing transverse momentum vector ( E miss T ). Therefore, this search requires good measurement and identification of the leptons and jets and precise understanding of the E miss T . Electrons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the EM calorimeter matched to a track reconstructed in the ID. Candidate electrons must have p T > 7 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.47.",

To ensure that this assumption is valid, the control regions are defined so as to have the closure factor N A /N B \u00d7 N D /N C close to unity. The control regions are defined after the preselection, and a requirement of E miss T > 60 GeV and E miss T /H T > 0.12 (\"cleaning cut\") is imposed to remove the low-E miss T phase space that is far away from the signal region. Since the E miss T and the topological variables used in the event selection are expected to have only a small correlation, they are used to define regions B, C and D. Events are sorted into region B if E miss T < 90 GeV or E miss T /H T < 0.6 and into region C if satisfying both the E miss T and E miss T /H T selections but failing to satisfy any of the remaining criteria, and the rest of the events constitute region D.

Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have extended the study to a higher mass range and reported their search results in multiple final states [20-27]. Currently, the most stringent upper limit on B H\u2192inv is around 24% at the 95% confidence level (CL) [23,25] with m H = 125 GeV. With certain assumptions, constraints on B H\u2192inv can be inferred from the visible decay channels, and an upper limit of 34% was obtained using LHC Run-1 data [28]. Similarly, DM has been searched for in a range of final states at the LHC [29-43], and no hints have been found to date. This Letter reports a search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV or WIMPs produced in association with a Z boson using 36.1 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in 13 TeV pp collisions. The search is carried out in a final state with two isolated electrons or muons from a Z boson decay and large missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) due to an invisible Higgs boson decay or a WIMP pair ( + E miss T",

There is no significant data excess above the expectation of the SM backgrounds. An observed (expected) upper limit of 67% (39%) is set on B H\u2192inv at the 95% CL for m H = 125 GeV, which can be compared to the observed (expected) 95% CL limit of 75% (62%) derived in the same final state using the ATLAS data collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. The expected B H\u2192inv limit is much improved compared to the previous one, while the improvement in the observed limit is marginal due to the small data excess observed in this search. The corresponding observed (expected) limit on the production cross-section of the Z H process with prompt Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays and invisible Higgs boson decays is 40 (23) fb at the 95% CL. Finally, exclusion limits are placed on masses in a simplified dark matter model with an axialvector mediator and fermionic WIMPs. The mediator mass m med is excluded up to 560 GeV at the 95% CL for a light WIMP, while the WIMP mass m \u03c7 is excluded up to 130 GeV for m med = 400 GeV.The constraint on the existence of dark matter from this search provides another input to the global search for dark matter at the LHC.Bern and Geneva, Switzerland; MOST, Taiwan; TAEK, Turkey; STFC, United Kingdom; DOE and NSF, United States of America.
