            "text": "The recently discovered Higgs-like particle [1,2] has properties so far consistent with the Standard Model (SM) expectation in terms of spin, parity and couplings [3,4]. However the excess in fermionic decay channels is still not firmly established. Therefore the study of Higgs properties in fermionic decay channels is of great importance to confirm or disprove the SM nature of the discovered Boson. In the SM with the present dataset of approximately 24 fb \u22121 delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded by the CMS experiment [5] the Higgs decay modes into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (denoted by \u03c4\u03c4 in the following) and bb are accessible. For a mass of 125 GeV the branching ratios are about 6.2% for the \u03c4\u03c4 decay and about 57% for the bb decay. In the bb decay channel the different production modes are very difficult to access and suffer from very different background composition, therefore different analysis techniques are used to extract the Higgs signal in each production mode. The studied production modes cover gluon fusion (only in \u03c4\u03c4), vector boson fusion (VBF) and associated production with W/Z bosons and top quarks (only in bb).",
