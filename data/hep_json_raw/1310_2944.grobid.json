            "text": "The precision measurement of basic quantum chromodynamic (QCD) observables provides information on various aspects of the Standard Model. Measurements of high-p T (hard) QCD processes involving jets and photons can be used to constrain the gluon portion of the protons parton distribution functions (PDFs) at high-momentum fraction. Jet physics also provides a check of the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 S . The underlying event arising from multipleparton interactions, beam-beam remnants, and initial/final state radiation provides an irreducible background to all measurements. As such, a good description by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is essential for making precision measurements, and searches for physics beyond the standard model. A measurement of the effective area parameter for double-parton scattering has also been performed, which is an important background in certain searches. This proceeding to the LHCP 2013 conference provides a brief summary of recent results on QCD using the ATLAS [1] detector at the LHC.",

            "text": "Inclusive jet cross sections have been measured at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV for anti-k t jets with |y| < 4.4 and p T up to 300 GeV [2]. Because the pileup conditions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV are similar to those of the 2010 run at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the same jet energy calibration is used. This provides a detailed understanding of the correlations of the jet energy calibration uncertainty between the two measurements. The double-differential cross section has been measured as a function of both p T and y, so that the experimental uncertainties are much reduced when the ratio of 2.76 TeV is taken with 7 TeV. The measurement is also performed in bins of x T = 2p T / \u221a s and y, where the theoretical uncertainties largely cancel between the two centre-of-mass energies. A PDF fit exploiting the measurements at both 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV is performed, a e-mail: chris.meyer@cern.ch providing a strong constraint on the gluon PDF at highmomentum fraction (see figure 1). Multijet production [3] provides a direct probe to the dependence of the theory prediction on higher order terms. Two observables are defined: First, the cross section of events with \u2265 3 jets divided by the cross section of events with \u2265 2 jets, both as a function of highest jet-p T . Second, the ratio of \u2265 3-jet to \u2265 2-jet samples of the inclusive jet cross section as a function of jet p T . A ratio of the two observables is taken (see figure 2) to reduce the uncertainty on the jet energy calibration, the dominant source of error. Because the first definition is proportional to the probability that a two-jet event radiates a third jet (thus is proportional to \u03b1 S ), and is less sensitive to the choice of renormalisation/factorisation scale, it is used in the fit for \u03b1 S . The best fit for \u03b1 S is determined using NLOJet++ predictions interfaced with the MSTW 2008 PDF set, for a scan of \u03b1 S values. A best fit value of \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.111 \u00b1 0.006(exp.) +0.016 \u22120.003) (theory) is found, showing good agreement with the global average. The fit value for \u03b1 S using different p T bins is evolved to the average p T value for each bin (up to 800 GeV) using the two- loop approximation of the Renormalization Group Equation, where agreement within the experimental uncertainties is seen when compared to the world average.",

Activity in the transverse region is increased due to NLO emission, such that the difference in activity between two transverse regions is also an interesting observable. Good agreement is observed when restricting the comparison of data and leading order MC simulation to events with exactly two jets, as expected in a region of phase space with little emission. In general the MC simulation shows decent agreement across a variety of variables, with HER-WIG performing slightly better describing the properties of charged particles in underlying event (see figure 5).",

Jets with p T > 20 GeV and |y| < 2.8 are considered for this measurement. The double-parton production fraction is used to derive the effective area parameter (\u03c3 eff ) for hard double-parton scattering.
