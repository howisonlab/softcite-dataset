            "text": "In the standard model (SM), the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decay D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is strongly suppressed by the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism [1]. The branching fraction for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 from short-distance contributions, such as an electromagnetic penguin transition, is predicted to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u221211 [2][3][4]. Long-distance contributions due to a vector meson coupling to a photon are expected to enhance the branching fraction to the range (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10 \u22128 [3,4]. These predictions are orders of magnitude beyond the reach of current experiments, but some extensions to the SM can enhance FCNC processes by many orders of magnitude. For example, in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric SM, gluino exchange can increase the branching fraction for the c \u2192 u\u03b3 transition to 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 [5,6].",

There are about 20 million D 0 mesons produced [10] from \u03c8(3770) decays in this sample. Taking advantage of the fact that D-meson production near the \u03c8(3770) resonance is solely through DD, we apply a tagged technique pioneered by the MARK III Collaboration [11]. After reconstructing a hadronically decayingD in an event (the tag), we then search for D-decay candidates of interest in the remainder of the event. (Unless otherwise noted, charge conjugate modes are implied throughout this paper.) This strategy suppresses background and provides an absolute normalization for branching fraction measurements independent of the integrated luminosity and DD production cross section. Therefore, searches for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 with BESIII at open-charm threshold are uniquely clean and provide a valuable complement to studies at the \u03a5(4S).",

The BESIII detector, which is described in detail elsewhere [14], has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 and consists of four main components. A smallcelled, helium-based, multilayer drift chamber (MDC) with 43 layers provides momentum resolution for 1-GeV/c charged particles in a 1-T magnetic field of 0.5%. Excellent charged particle identification is achieved by utilizing the energy loss in the MDC (dE/dx). A timeof-flight system (TOF) for additional charged particle identification is composed of plastic scintillators. The time resolution is 80 ps in the barrel and 110 ps in the endcaps, giving 2\u03c3 K/\u03c0 separation for momenta up to about 1 GeV/c. An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) is constructed of 6240 CsI (Tl) crystals arranged in a cylindrical shape (barrel) plus two endcaps. For 1.0-GeV photons, the energy resolution is 2.5% in the barrel and 5% in the endcaps. Finally, a muon chamber system (MUC) is constructed of resistive plate chambers.

We extract the ST yield for each tag mode and the combined yields of all five modes from fits to M tag BC distributions in the samples described above. The signal shape is derived from the MC simulation which includes the effects of beam-energy smearing, initial-state radiation, the \u03c8(3770) line shape, and detector resolution. We then convolute the line shape with a Gaussian to compensate for a difference in resolution between data and our MC simulation. Mean and width of the convoluted Gaussian, along with the overall normalization, are left free in our nominal fitting procedure. The background is described by an ARGUS function [21], which models combinatorial contributions. In the fit, we leave free all parameters of the background function, except its endpoint which is fixed at 1.8865 GeV/c 2 . Figure 1 shows the fits to our tag-candidate samples. Tag yields, given in Table I, are obtained by subtracting the fitted background estimates from the overall fits in data within the narrow signal window M tag BC (1.858 < M tag BC < 1.874 GeV/c 2 ).

In order to correctly estimate their sizes, we take a data-driven approach by performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the two-dimensional distribution of \u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 versus \u2206E tag . We use \u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 distributions rather than M \u03b3\u03b3 BC distributions as the background from non-DD decays is more easily addressed in the fit.

The fitting ranges are |\u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 | < 0.25 GeV and |\u2206E tag | < 0.1 GeV. These wide ranges are chosen to have adequate statistics of the continuum backgrounds in our fit.

For the background from continuum processes, we include a flat component in two dimensions, allowing the normalization to float. The contribution from D + D \u2212 decays is completely negligible. We model the background from other D 0D0 decays with a pair of functions.

The systematic uncertainties in ST yields (1.0%) are estimated first for individual tag modes, and then combined in quadrature with weights based on the observed tag yields (N i tag ). The sources for the uncertainties of ST yields we consider are the choice of fit range, assumed signal parameterization, and the M tag BC signal window. Combined in quadrature, these total 3.8%.",

            "text": "We also consider six possible sources of systematic effects due to our fitting procedure. (1) Fits are redone with all possible combinations of fitting ranges: \u2212(0.12, 0.10, 0.08)<\u2206E tag <+(0.08, 0.10, 0.12) GeV and \u2212(0.30, 0.25, 0.20)<\u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 <+(0.20, 0.25, 0.30) GeV. 2The MC-based analytic form of the D 0D0 background shape (excluding the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 contribution) is varied by changing the input branching fractions for [17]. (3) The flat non-DD background shape is replaced with a shape that is linear in the \u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 dimension. (4) The fixed size of the background from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is varied by \u00b14.6%. (5) The fixed shape of the background from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is studied by comparing \u2206E distributions of DT events from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 /K 0 S \u03c0 0 /K\u03c0\u03c0 0 between data and MC simulations in which we intentionally ignore the lower-energy photon from each \u03c0 0 decay to mimic our background. We conclude that we do not need to assign additional systematic uncertainty due to the assumed D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 background shape in the fit, except to give an extra Gaussian smearing of \u03c3 = 5 MeV in the \u2206E tag dimension. (6) The fixed signal shape is studied based on the DT D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 sample in which we study distributions of its \u2206E tag and \u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 for four cases by requiring that one of the two photons from each of the two \u03c0 0 to have at least 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 GeV to mimic our signal photon energies. From all four cases, we find that we need an extra Gaussian smearing of \u03c3 = 16 MeV and a shift by a factor of 1.0025 in the \u2206E \u03b3\u03b3 dimension as well as an extra smearing of \u03c3 = 5 MeV in the \u2206E tag dimension. Table II summarizes systematic uncertainties that are independent of our fitting procedure, as well as systematic variations that we consider to estimate uncertainties due to the fitting procedure. In the next section, we describe how we combine these systematic uncertainties into our measurement.  Since we do not observe a signal, we set an upper limit on the branching fraction for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. We first obtain a smooth background-only PDF shape from the sample via the kernel estimation method [23]. This is done by utilizing the RooFit class [24] RooNDKeysPdf [25]. We then generate 2.2 million toy MC samples by randomly distributing points according to the PDF shape, while taking into account the Poisson distribution. We fit to each of these toy samples while randomly making systematic variations in the fitting procedure, as described in the previous section. We also simultaneously smear each of the fitted branching fractions with a Gaussian whose width (3.8%) corresponds to the total systematic uncertainty that is not associated with the fitting procedure. Figure 4 shows an accumulation of the resulting branching fractions for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The shaded region represents 90% of its physical region, which we use to set our 90% CL upper limit of B(D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) < 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . If the systematic uncertainty were ignored in setting this limit it would be reduced by 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . The expected measurement of branching fraction from these toy experiments is (+0.7 +2.0 \u22122.5 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , where the quoted uncertainties correspond to 68% of the areas under the curves in Fig. 4. The mean value of the accumulated branching fractions is consistent with the value of the branching fraction from the nominal fit to data at 0.6\u03c3 level. ",

The reconstruction of \u03c0 0 candidates is the same as those in the ST modes described in Section III A. We choose a pair of reconstructed \u03c0 0 s that give the smallest |\u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 |, and require \u22120.06 < \u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 < +0.03 GeV. The resolution of \u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is about 20 MeV. Then we extract the signal yield from a fit to M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BC . The efficiency is determined to be \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 = 36% from MC simulations. Figure 5 shows a fit to the M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BC distribution in 1.8400 < M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BC < 1.8865 GeV/c 2 . We use a double-Gaussian function to describe the signal shape, which is shown as a dotted line, and the background shape is described by an ARGUS background function [21]. From this fit, which yields \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 91.8/85, we obtain N \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 = 6277 \u00b1 156 events. In Fig. 5, we also overlay the backgrounds that are estimated by the MC simulations (gray shaded histogram).  The quoted total systematic uncertainty (3.6%) is the quadrature sum of the following seven sources of uncertainty. (1) The uncertainty due to \u03c0 0 reconstruction is estimated with a DT D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 sample. (2) Histogram binning scheme is varied. (3) Narrower (1.8450 < M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BC < 1.8820 GeV/c 2 ) and broader (1.8350 < M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BC < 1.8865 GeV/c 2 ) fit ranges are tried. (4) Narrower (\u22120.055 < \u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 < 0.025 GeV) and broader (\u22120.065 < \u2206E \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 < 0.035 GeV) requirements are applied. (5) Instead of using the ARGUS function [21], a MC-based background shape is used. (6) To assess a posible bias due to the signal line shape, we fix the all shape parameters of the double Gaussians based on the shape extracted from the DT D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 sample. 7The uncertainty of the determination of N D 0D0 is determined based on Refs. [9,10]. The resultant relative uncertainties are shown in Table III. Using 2.92 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilation data collected at \u221a s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we have searched for the FCNC decay D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and observe no significant signal. We set an upper limit B(D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) < 3.8\u00d710 \u22126 at the 90% CL, which is consistent with the upper limit previously set by the BABAR Collaboration [7] and with the SM prediction. Ours is the first experimental study of this decay using data at open-charm threshold. Employing the DT technique, we are able to suppress the backgrounds from non-DD decays effectively. Our analysis also shows that the peaking background from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 can be reliably estimated with a data-driven method.",
