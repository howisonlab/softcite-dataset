The data sample, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.14 fb \u22121 . In both cases the number of events observed after all selection requirements is consistent with expectations from background and standard model signal predictions. The resulting upper limits on the branching fractions are BF(B s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and BF(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 at 95% confidence level (CL). Furthermore, the combination of the results of the search for the decay B s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 by the CMS and LHCb experiments is presented. The combined upper limit is BF < 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 95% CL.",
