Some works have also shown that matter swapping between braneworlds can occur. Here we report the results of an experiment -at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France) -designed to detect thermal neutron swapping to and from another braneworld, thus constraining the probability p 2 of such an event. The limit, p < 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u221210 at 95% C.L., is 4 orders of magnitude better than the previous bound based on the disappearance of stored ultracold neutrons. In the simplest braneworld scenario, for two parallel Planck-scale branes separated by a distance d, we conclude that d > 87 in Planck length units.",

            "text": "Our observable Universe could be a braneworld: a fourdimensional surface embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime (the bulk) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. This idea is frequently considered in connection with the deepest questions of fundamental physics. In particular, quantum theories of gravity foresee the existence of extra dimensions to describe the spacetime at the Planck scale. Hidden braneworlds are also invoked to solve the hierarchy problem [8][9][10] or to elucidate the nature of dark matter and dark energy [11][12][13][14][15][16]. However, empirical evidence supporting braneworlds is currently lacking. In this paper, we report the results of a neutron-passing-through-walls experiment designed specifically to detect neutron swapping to and from another braneworld [17]. Indeed, as detailed hereafter, the theory allows for particles swapping between two adjacent branes in the bulk [17][18][19]. We used the nuclear reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France): a very bright source of neutrons which possibly also emits neutrons copiously into a hidden braneworld. To detect neutrons swapping back from the hidden world, we used a helium-3 counter shielded against the neutron background of the reactor hall with a rejection factor of about a million. Even without significant excess of events in the detector, we can set a limit on the neutron -hidden neutron swapping probability. Our experiment constitutes a unique experimental window to braneworlds and to Planck scale physics. Beyond braneworlds, our improved bound is relevant for other new-physics scenarios predicting oscillations of the neutron into a sterile particle [20][21][22][23][24]: quite a common concept.",

Standard-Model particles are trapped along this wall which is realized in the bulk as a scalar-field soliton [1], as suggested by the effective field theories relating to the low-energy limit of string theory [6]. Although many braneworlds could coexist within the bulk [5, 11-13, 15, 17-19], in the following we consider a twobrane Universe consisting of two copies of the Standard Model, localized in two adjacent 3D branes (see Fig. 1a). While -for processes below the brane energy scale c/\u03be -these two sectors are mutually invisible to each other at the zeroth-order approximation, matter fields in separate branes mix at the first-order approximation through L c = ig\u03c8 + \u03b3 5 \u03c8 \u2212 + ig\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b3 5 \u03c8 + , where \u03c8 \u00b1 are the Dirac fermionic fields in each braneworld -denoted (+) and (\u2212) [18]. The interbrane coupling g intrinsically depends on the distance d between branes and on their thicknesses \u03be as g \u223c (1/\u03be) exp(\u2212d/\u03be) [18]. The brane energy scale could be as high as the Planck scale m Pl \u2248 10 19 GeV: well beyond the reach of direct searches at high energy particle colliders. Still, it is possible to explore the braneworld through matter swapping induced by the coupling g at low energy. Indeed, precision experiments, in particular with neutrons, can be designed to monitor matter disappearance or disappearance-reappearance processes [17,19].",

From a practical point of view, each collision at a nucleus acts as a quantum measurement and the neutron is reduced either in our, visible, world or in the other, invisible, braneworld (to become a hidden neutron) with a probability p/2 [17]. Hidden neutrons could, therefore, be generated in the moderator medium of a nuclear reactor, where a high flux of neutrons undergoes many elastic collisions. Being located in another braneworld, these hidden neutrons would interact very weakly with matter and freely escape the reactor. However, the reverse swapping process would permit us to detect them -with an efficiency also proportional to pusing a usual neutron detector located close to the reactor. The disappearance and reappearance of neutrons due to the swapping between braneworlds would lead to the possibility of neutrons passing through a wall.",

The core dynamics were modelled assuming a simplified geometry (i.e. uniform fuel, minor neutron beam-tubes omitted, etc.) From this simulation, we obtained the evolution of the thermal neutron flux distribution after the start of the reactor cycle 175 (17 th June 2015) and during the experiment (6-10 th July 2015). In order to estimate the accuracy of the calculation, the simplified dynamic simulation was compared with a static simulation, using a fully detailed geometry made by ILL staff [29]. We found that the discrepancy in the total neutron fluxes is lower than 2% but the dynamical model overestimates the thermal neutron flux at the periphery of the reactor by up to 20%. To get a conservative estimate of the hidden neutron flux, we applied a global reduction factor of 0.8 of the neutron flux \u03a6 + calculated with the dynamical model.

Assuming that the hidden brane is empty, with zero gravitational energy, we set \u03b7 \u2248 100 eV corresponding to the typical binding energy of a neutron in the galactic gravitational field [15]. Then we assume that the thickness of the brane is given by the Planck length \u03be = L P \u2248 10 \u221235 m. In the simple model, the interbrane coupling depends upon the distance d between branes as g \u223c (1/\u03be) exp(\u2212d/\u03be) [18]. In this scenario we conclude that d > 87L P . For TeV-scale braneworlds (\u03be = L TeV \u2248 10 \u221219 m), the limit would be d > 50L TeV .

A compact fuel element sits in the centre of a 2.5 m diameter tank containing the heavy water moderator. Details such as inserts for neutron beam lines are not shown. The heavy water tank serves as a source of hidden neutrons generated by the (n + D 2 O \u2192 hidden n + D 2 O) scattering processes[17]. The detector is situated behind the biological shielding (1.5 m thick light water and 1.7 m thick dense concrete) at 7.35 m \u00b1 0.15 m from the centre of the reactor and at 30 cm below the median plane. We used a cylindrical helium-3 (+ 5 % of CO 2 ) counter with a volume of 33.5 cm 3 and a gas pressure of 4 atm at 20 \u2022 C. The detector was surrounded by a dedicated multilayer neutron shield.
