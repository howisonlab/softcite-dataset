Contrary to the expectations (cf. above) the shape of the distribution is very similar to the one of the K multiplicity sum, presented in the right panel of Fig. 1. For easier comparison the kaon multiplicity sum was multiplied by a factor 6.4, which minimizes the \u03c7 2 between \u03c0 and K multiplicity sums: a value of \u03c7 2 /ndf = 5.1/8 in the case when the correlation between positive and negative particles is taken into account as described above, or \u03c7 2 /ndf = 7.7/8 in the case when systematic uncertainties are treated as independent. Especially interesting is the fact that both multiplicities start to rise more or less at the same x. In [1], the increase for kaons is attributed solely to the strange quark PDF having very different shape from the non-strange sea. But as presented here, such an explanation does not work for the \u03c0 data. On the other hand, very similar shape of the distributions suggests that there is a common source which causes the observed effect.",

Moreover, as noted by the same authors in [6], the analyses of HERMES multiplicity data available in x and Q 2 representations do not give compatible results. For example for x representation at x = 0.17 and Q 2 = 3.2 GeV 2 the \u03c0 multiplicity sum is: 0.675 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b1 0.006. For almost the same kinematic point, x = 0.17 and Q 2 = 3.8 GeV 2 , but in Q 2 representation, the \u03c0 multiplicity sum is 0.714 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b1 0.007. A difference of about 6% is seen. It is much larger than statistical and systematic uncertainties, while a large part of the data is the same. Observe that the average x value of the presented data points is high enough, so that the point in Q 2 representation doesn't contain low x data (x < 0.08), whose presence could otherwise explain the observed difference. In my opinion the HERMES multiplicities should be available simultaneously in (x, y, z) or (x, Q 2 , z) representations so that such effects can be studied in more details. In what follows it is assumed that the current HERMES results in x representation were extracted correctly from the data. ",
