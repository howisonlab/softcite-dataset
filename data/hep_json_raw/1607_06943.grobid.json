            "text": "Measurements of the cross sections for massive gauge boson pair production in proton-proton collisions provide an essential test of the electroweak sector of the standard model (SM). The electroweak interaction in the SM is determined by the non-Abelian SU (2) L \u00d7 U (1) Y gauge group. The non-Abelian nature of the electroweak gauge group leads to gauge boson self-interactions via triple gauge couplings (TGCs) and quartic gauge couplings (QGCs). The weak gauge boson pair production includes TGC interactions as well as QGC interactions via vector boson scattering. Thus, the study of diboson production can directly test both the weak interaction and the non-Abelian nature of the electroweak gauge group. The next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) perturbative QCD corrections for the boson pair production have substantial impact on the predicted cross sections due to the addition of the gluon-initiated processes that are enhanced at energies available at the CERN LHC. The increase in the cross section is significant compared to the experimental uncertainties, allowing LHC boson pair cross section measurements to directly validate higher-order perturbative QCD calculations.",

The muons are selected from among the reconstructed muon track candidates by applying minimal quality requirements on the track components in the muon system and by ensuring that muons are associated to small energy deposits in the calorimeters. A single tight working point is defined. The electrons and muons are required to originate from the primary vertex, which is chosen to be the vertex with the highest sum of p 2 T of its constituent tracks [25]. For each lepton track the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex in the transverse plane, d xy , is required to be less than 0.01 (0.07) cm for electrons in the barrel (endcap) region and 0.01 cm for muons with p T less than 20 GeV and 0.02 cm for muons with p T greater than 20 GeV. The distance along the beamline, d z , must be less than 0.4 (0.6) cm for electrons in the barrel (endcap) and 0.1 cm for muons. For the very tight electron working point, electrons Jets are reconstructed using PF objects. The anti-k T jet clustering algorithm [26] with R = 0.4 is used. The standard method for jet energy corrections [27] is applied. These include corrections to the pileup contribution that keep the jet energy correction and the corresponding uncertainty almost independent of the number of pileup interactions. To exclude electrons and muons from the jet sample, the jets are required to be separated from the identified leptons by R > 0.3. In order to reject jets coming from pileup collisions (pileup jets), a multivariate-based jet identification algorithm [28] is applied. This algorithm takes advantage of differences in the shape of energy deposits in a jet cone between hard-scatter and pileup jets. The jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 5.0. To identify the top quark background contribution in its decay to b quarks, the CSVv2 b tagging algorithm [29] with the tight working point is used [30]. The efficiency for selecting b quark jets is \u224849% with a misidentification probability of \u22484% for c quark jets and \u22480.1% for light quark jets.",
