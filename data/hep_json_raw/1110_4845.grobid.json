The scattered muon and the produced hadrons are detected in a 50 m long wide-acceptance forward spectrometer with excellent particle identification capabilities [1]. A variety of tracking detectors are used to cope with the different requirements of position accuracy and rate capability at different angles. Particle identification is provided by a large acceptance RICH detector, two electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and muon filters.",
