Zucchelli ii6 (CDF Collaboration) \u2020 which, if observed, could provide indirect indications of unknown particles or interactions. To date, CP violation has been established in transitions of strange and bottom hadrons, with effects consistent with the SM predictions [1,2]. Studies of CP violation in the interactions of charm quarks offer a unique probe for non-SM physics. Charm transitions are complementary to the processes involving K and B mesons in that heavy uptype quarks (charge +2/3) are present in the initial state. Therefore, measurements of CP violation in charm probe the presence of down-type (charge \u22121/3) non-SM physics through charged-current couplings [3]. Because charm transitions are well described by the physics of the first two quark generations, CP -violating effects are expected not to exceed O(10 \u22122 ) in the SM [3]. Indeed, no CP violation has been experimentally established yet in charmquark dynamics [1]. Decay-time-dependent rate asymmetries of Cabibbosuppressed decays into CP eigenstates, such as D \u2192 h + h \u2212 , where D indicates a D 0 or D 0 meson, and h a K or \u03c0 meson, are among the most sensitive probes for CP violation in this sector [4]. Such asymmetries,",

Oscillations indicate D 0 -D 0 transitions governed by the exchange of virtual heavy particles occurring before the decay. Penguin decays are second-order transitions mediated by an internal loop. Either amplitude may be affected by the exchange of non-SM particles, which could enhance the magnitude of the observed CP violation with respect to the SM expectation. The asymmetry A CP (t) thus receives contributions from any difference between D 0 and D 0 decay amplitudes (direct CP violation) and from any difference in oscilla-tion probabilities between charm and anticharm mesons or interference between decays that follow, or not, an oscillation (indirect CP violation).

At level 2, drift-chamber tracks are combined with silicon-detector hits and their impact parameters (transverse distances of closest approach to the beam line) are determined with 45 \u00b5m resolution (including the beam spread) [16] and required to be between 0.12 and 1.0 mm. A more stringent opening-angle requirement of 2 \u2022 < \u2206\u03c6 < 90 \u2022 is also applied. Each track pair is then used to form a D-meson candidate, whose flight distance in the transverse plane projected onto the transverse momentum (L xy ) is required to exceed 200 \u00b5m. At level 3, the selection is reapplied on events fully reconstructed by an array of commercial processors.",

Two tracks from oppositely-charged par-ticles compatible with the trigger requirements are combined, with pion or kaon assignment, in a kinematic fit to a common decay vertex to form a D candidate. A charged particle with p T > 400 MeV/c is associated with each D candidate to form D * \u00b1 candidates. We improve the reconstruction with respect to Ref. [11] by using the position of the beam as a constraint in the fit of the D * \u00b1 decay and retain only candidates with good fit quality. Since the beam position is determined more accurately than the trajectory of the soft pion, this provides a 25% improvement in D * \u00b1 mass resolution. Other offline requirements are based on a more accurate determination of the quantities used in the trigger and are detailed in Ref. [11]. The D \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 samples are separated by requiring the selected candidates to have the relevant h + h \u2212 mass within 24 MeV/c 2 of the known D mass, m D [6]. We reconstruct 6.1 \u00d7 10 (Fig. 1). The composition of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample is dominated by the signal of D * -tagged D decays and a background of real D decays associated with random pions or random combinations of three tracks (combinatorics). In the K + K \u2212 sample, an additional background is contributed by misreconstructed multibody charm-meson decays, dominated by D 0 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and the D 0 \u2192 h \u2212 + \u03bd contributions, where is a muon or an electron. Each decay-mode sample is divided into charm and anticharm subsamples and into 30 bins of decay time between 0.15\u03c4 and 20\u03c4 , chosen so that each contains approximately the same number of candidates. The D decay time is determined as t = L xy m D /p T , with approximately 0.2\u03c4 resolution, independent of decay time. The observed decay-time distribution is biased by the trigger. The effect of the bias is assumed to be independent of the D-meson flavor and is accounted for when integrating Eq. (2) over each decay-time bin.",

Since we determine impact parameters using information associated with the D decay only, the shapes of the impact-parameter distributions of D 0 and D 0 mesons are consistent. The parameters of the primary component are fixed in all fits. They are derived from fits of candidates in the first decay-time bin (t/\u03c4 < 1.18), where any bias from the O(%) secondary contamination is negligible, as supported by repeating the fit using an alternative model derived from the second bin and observing no significant difference in the results. The parameters of the secondary component are determined by the fit independently for each decay-time bin. Example impactparameter fits are shown in Fig. 2.
