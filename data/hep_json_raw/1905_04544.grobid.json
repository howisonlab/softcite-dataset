The measurements were carried out using ramped beam technique which allows for the slow and continuous beam momentum change near the threshold of \u03b7 meson creation. The luminosity was obtained based on pd \u2192 3 He\u03b7 reaction and quasielastic proton-proton scattering. The bound state of \u03b7-meson and 3 He nucleus is searched for in pd \u2192 3 He2\u03b3 and pd \u2192 3 He6\u03b3 channels. The analysis is still in progress and the estimated upper limit value is on the level of few nanobarns.",

The experimental searches for \u03b7-mesic helium-3 have been performed by MAMI [7,8] and COSY11 [9,10] collaborations but no bound state was observed. In the experiment studying \u03b7 meson photoproduction [7,8], a peak-like structure was observed though its interpretation is still a subject of discussion. In earlier experiments on hadronic \u03b7 production [9,10], the upper limit for bound state creation cross section upper 70 nb was obtained.",

In these channels, the bound state would be visible in case of direct bound \u03b7 decay without being absorbed by any nucleon: pd \u2192 ( 3 He\u03b7) bound \u2192 3 He\u03b3\u03b3 and pd \u2192 ( 3 He\u03b7) bound \u2192 3 He\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u2192 3 He6\u03b3. For efficiency estimation, the Monte Carlo simulation for bound state production and decay was performed. The distribution of 3 He \u2212 \u03b7 relative momentum was calculated by S. Hirenzaki and H. Nagahiro [27]. The simulation was carried out with assumption that 3 He plays a role of spectator. Coupled \u03b7 meson decay on two \u03b3 quanta is assumed to be isotropic in the \u03b7 rest frame and the decay into three \u03c0 0 mesons was simulated assuming uniform phase space population. Each of \u03c0 0 decays into two \u03b3 quanta isotropically in \u03c0 0 rest frame.",
