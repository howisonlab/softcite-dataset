            "text": "We present midrapidity measurements from the PHENIX experiment of large parity-violating single spin asymmetries of high transverse momentum electrons and positrons from W \u00b1 /Z decays, produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at center of mass energies of \u221a s=500 and 510 GeV. These asymmetries allow direct access to the anti-quark polarized parton distribution functions due to the parity-violating nature of the W -boson coupling to quarks and anti-quarks. The results presented are based on data collected in 2011, 2012, and 2013 with an integrated luminosity of 240 pb \u22121 , which exceeds previous PHENIX published results by a factor of more than 27. These high Q 2 data probe the parton structure of the proton at W mass scale and provide an important addition to our understanding of the anti-quark parton helicity distribution functions at an intermediate Bjorken x value of roughly MW / \u221a s = 0.16. The determination of the contributions of partons to the spin of the proton has inspired significant theoretical and experimental effort for several decades [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. The quark contribution to the nucleon spin has been deduced through measurements in polarized inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive deepinelastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments [6,[12][13][14][15]. Although the overall quark contribution (\u2206\u03a3 = \u2206q + \u2206q) has been well-determined through DIS experiments (in the range 10 \u22123 < x < 1), the contributions from sea quarks separated by flavor (determined through SIDIS experiments) are comparatively poorly known. Data from HERMES and COMPASS [6,16] provide constraints on the contribution from the sea quarks, however, uncertainties in fragmentation functions and the low energy scales of fixed target experiments limit the accuracy with which these measurements can quantitatively deter- * PHENIX Co-Spokesperson: morrison@bnl.gov \u2020 PHENIX Co-Spokesperson: jamie.nagle@colorado.edu \u2021 Deceased mine the sea quark contribution [17]. As such, an independent measurement using a different technique [18] to determine the contribution from different flavors of sea quarks is desirable. The use of W -boson production provides just such a solution. Parity is maximally-violated in the W couplings to quarks and leptons, so W \u00b1 production in p+p collisions proceeds only by coupling to left-handed quarks and right-handed anti-quarks (u LdR \u2192 W + and d L\u016bR \u2192 W \u2212 ). By measuring decay leptons in the final state, the flavor and helicity state of the colliding quarks can be determined [18][19][20][21]. Asymmetries measured in W \u00b1 by reversing the helicity of a colliding proton are sensitive to the individual quark/anti-quark helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) (\u2206u, \u2206d, \u2206\u016b and \u2206d). Moreover, the energy scale for these events, of the order of the W -boson mass, allows for small and precisely calculable higher-order corrections.",

The energy resolution was determined from the p T -dependence of the widths of reconstructed \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson mass peaks. The same \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson mass peaks were used in the energy calibration of the EMCal, and were continuously monitored. Similar to our previous analysis [9] and test beam data results [24], the EMCal energy scale was confirmed to within 2.5%, for the energy range analyzed with this data. A loose time-of-flight cut was applied in the analysis to remove noncollision background.",

This was measured and monitored using straight tracks from special runs with the magnetic field off throughout the data taking period. An isolation cut was very efficient at suppressing background events with a high degree of activity around a candidate electron (as would happen for jet events). The cut parameter r iso was defined as r iso = (\u03a3E i ) /E e , where E i is the i-th EMCal cluster energy and track p T around the electron candidate in a cone with a radius in \u03b7 and \u03c6 of 0.4, and E e is the energy of electron candidate. A candidate was kept for the analysis if r iso < 0.1. Figure 1 shows the resulting yield of electron and positron candidates for the 2013 data set. A Jacobian peak around p e T =40 GeV/c corresponds to e \u00b1 from W and Z boson decays. The isolation cut removed about 90% of the background (as was evaluated from the background dominated region between 10 and 20 GeV/c) and left more than 90% of the signal in the Jacobian peak region untouched (as evaluated from simulations explained below). Similar results were obtained for the 2011 and 2012 data sets. Above 30 GeV/c the remaining candidate events after the isolation cut are dominated by W and Z decay to electrons/positrons, and by background events below 25 GeV/c. This background consists mainly of high momentum electrons/positrons from conversion of \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 decay photons, charged pions/kaons, b,c \u2192 e de-cays and accidental matching between high energy EM-Cal clusters and tracks in the DC. The Z-boson contribution in the signal region above 30 GeV/c was estimated to be 7% (25%) for the positrons (electrons) after all analysis cuts were applied, as determined from simulations. The asymmetry of the Z has been estimated theoretically using the DSSV08 PDF sets and measured by the STAR collaboration [11] to be \u22120.07\u00b10.14.",

Asymmetries obtained in this fashion must be corrected for background events, which are parity-conserving, in the signal region. This dilution factor can be defined as (A \u2212 B)/A, where A (B) is the number of all (background) events in the signal region 30 < p T < 50 GeV/c.

The major advantage of this method is that it does not require an a priori known functional form to test against data.

While the DSSV 14 curve was obtained from a global fit of DIS and SIDIS data (including recent COMPASS results [15,16]), the NNPDFpol1.1 uncertainty band contains the 2012 STAR [11] result for flavor separation in addition to DIS data. The theoretical asymmetry calculations agree with the data within 1.5 \u03c3 uncertainty of the data points. These results will be used to further constrain the quark and anti-quark polarized parton distributions functions at an intermediate Bjorken x value of roughly M W / \u221a s = 0.16. Figure 3 shows the combined asymmetry for all of the PHENIX data sets and published data from STAR [11]. The two data sets cannot be compared directly, because PHENIX measures the asymmetry from W \u00b1 + Z decays, while the STAR result is solely from W \u00b1 decays. The comparison can be made through the curves, which account for the specifics of each measurement. Qualitatively, both data sets show the same trend with data points below (above) the central value of the theoretical prediction for W + (W \u2212 ), for |\u03b7| < 0.5. The W \u2212 difference corresponds to a larger \u2206\u016b contribution in the covered x \u223c 0.16 range, when compared with the central value of the DSSV 14 PDF fit calculation.",

These new results and the STAR data [11] will help constrain the anti-quark PDFs in a global analysis. Asymmetries calculated from global fits based on previous measurements, such as DSSV14 and NNPDFpol1.1, are consistent with our data. The use of the electroweak interaction provides an independent tool to extract quark and anti-quark helicity contribution. The data presented here are complementary to previous SIDIS measurements and bring the field one step closer to elucidation of the proton-spin puzzle [1].",
