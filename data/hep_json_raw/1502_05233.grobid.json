The largest source of systematic errors comes from the errors on the measured efficiencies of \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 , that are used to correct the asymmetry for difference in efficiency of \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 . Another large source of systematic uncertainty comes from the QCD background estimation. The error from the QCD background estimation is taken from two parts, the error coming from the ratio of positive and negative muon events in the QCD background and the uncertainty in the shape of the MET distribution coming from the QCD background. Some of the other major sources of systematic uncertainty come from uncertainty in the muon momentum scale, effect of final state radiation (FSR) (FSR is not corrected for in the measured asymmetry but systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for its effect) and PDF uncertainties coming from the MC samples used in the measurement. Figure 6 displays the uncertainties coming from different sources for the p T > 25 GeV measurement of muon charge asymmetry. As a cross-check, muon charge asymmetry is measured separately for the positive and negative \u03b7 regions by performing an identical measurement in 22 muon \u03b7 bins. The asymmetry obtained from the negative and the positive regions is compared as shown in Figure 7 for the p T > 25 GeV case. The charge asymmetries for \u03b7 > 0 and \u03b7 < 0 regions are in good agreement with each other. The final measurement of the muon charge asymmetry along with the uncertainties is compared to predictions by five different PDF sets as shown in Figure 8 for the muon p T > 25 GeV sample and in Figure 9 for the muon p T > 35 GeV sample. The PDF predictions are calculated at NLO using NLO FEWZ 3.1. The measured muon charge asymmetry is in good agreement with predictions from CT10, NNPDF and HERA PDF sets. The agreement with predictions from MSTW PDF set is poor, although it is slightly improved for MSTW2008CPdeut PDF set.",
