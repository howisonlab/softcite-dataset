The result is consistent with theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. It is used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the predicted cross-section on m pole t , giving m pole t = 173.1 +2.0 \u22122.1 GeV. It is also combined with measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV to derive ratios and double ratios of tt and Z cross-sections at different energies. The same event sample is used to measure absolute and normalised differential cross-sections as functions of singlelepton and dilepton kinematic variables, and the results are compared with predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators.",

The large mass of the top quark, close to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, gives it a unique role in the Standard Model of particle physics and potential extensions, and tt production also forms an important background in many searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Precise measurements of absolute rates and differential distributions in tt production are therefore a vital tool in fully exploiting the discovery potential of the LHC.",

            "text": "Predictions for the inclusive tt production cross-section in proton-proton ( pp) collisions, \u03c3 tt , are available at next-tonext-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , including the resummation of next-tonext-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [1][2][3][4][5][6], and are in excellent agreement with measurements from ATLAS and CMS at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. At \u221a s = 13 TeV, and assuming a fixed top quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV, the NNLO+NNLL prediction is 832 \u00b1 35 +20 \u221229 pb, as calculated using the Top++ 2.0 program [14]. The first uncertainty corresponds to parton distribution function (PDF) and \u03b1 S uncertainties, and the second to QCD scale variations. The former were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [15] with the MSTW2008 [16,17], CT10 NNLO [18,19] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [20] PDF sets. 1 The latter was calculated from the envelope of predictions with the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales varied independently up or down by a factor of two from their default values of \u03bc F = \u03bc R = m t , whilst never letting them differ by more than a factor of two [21,22]. The total uncertainty corresponds to a relative precision of +4.8 \u22125.5 %. The predicted cross-section also depends strongly on m t , decreasing by 2.7% for a 1 GeV increase in the top mass. The top quark mass parameter used in the cross-section prediction is actually the pole mass m pole t , corresponding to the definition of the mass of a free particle. This allows \u03c3 tt measurements to be interpreted as measurements of m pole t , free of the theoretical ambiguities linked to the direct reconstruction of m t from the invariant mass of its decay products [23][24][25][26]. Ratios of tt production cross-sections at different centre-of-mass energies are also of interest, e.g. R tt 13/7 = \u03c3 tt (13 TeV)/\u03c3 tt (7 TeV). Predictions for such ratios benefit from significant cancellations in the QCD scale and top quark mass uncertainties, but are still sensitive to the choice of PDF. The NNLO+NNLL predictions with the same set of assumptions as given for \u03c3 tt above, and a 1 GeV uncertainty in m t , are R tt 13/7 = 4.69\u00b10. 16 and R tt 13/8 = 3.28\u00b10.08, i.e. relative uncertainties of 3.3% and 2.5%. Double ratios of tt to Z production cross-sections allow the experimental uncertainties to be further reduced, by normalising the tt cross-section at each energy to the corresponding cross-section for Z boson production [27].",

            "text": "The e\u03bc + b-tagged jets sample also allows precise measurements of the differential distributions of the leptons produced in tt events to be made. ATLAS has published [29] measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV of the absolute and normalised differential cross-sections as functions of the transverse momentum p T and absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | of the single leptons 3 (combined for electrons and muons), the p T , invariant mass and absolute rapidity of the e\u03bc system ( p e\u03bc T , m e\u03bc and |y e\u03bc |), the absolute azimuthal angle | \u03c6| between the two leptons in the transverse plane ( \u03c6 e\u03bc ), and the scalar sums of the transverse momenta ( p e T + p \u03bc T ) and energies (E e + E \u03bc ) of the two leptons. These distributions were found to be generally well described by predictions from a variety of leading-order (LO) multileg and next-to-leading-order (NLO) tt matrix-element event generators interfaced to parton showers, and by NLO fixed-order QCD calculations. The sensitivity of the data to the gluon PDF and to the top quark pole mass was also demonstrated. This paper measures the same distributions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, using tt samples which are about six times the size of those available at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Two-dimensional distributions of |\u03b7 |, |y e\u03bc | and \u03c6 e\u03bc as functions of m e\u03bc are also reported. The data are again compared with the predictions of various NLO tt matrix-element event generators, but the interpretations in terms of PDF constraints and m pole t are left for future work. The event selection, measurement methodology and uncertainty evaluations for both the inclusive tt cross-section and the differential distributions are similar to those used at 3 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector, and the z axis along the beam line. Pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan \u03b8/2, and transverse momentum and energy are defined relative to the beam line as p T = p sin \u03b8 and E T = E sin \u03b8. The azimuthal angle around the beam line is denoted by \u03c6, and distances in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space by R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . The rapidity is defined as y = 1 2 ln E+ pz E\u2212 pz , where p z is the z-component of the momentum and E is the energy of the relevant object or system. The distance in (y, \u03c6) space is given by R y = ( y) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [7,29], with the exception that the minimum lepton transverse momentum requirement has been lowered from 25 to 20 GeV, whilst still requiring at least one lepton to be above the lepton trigger threshold of [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] GeV. This increases the fraction of tt \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bdbb events that are selected by 16%, thus reducing the extrapolation uncertainties in the modelling of tt production and decay. The data and Monte Carlo simulation samples used in the analyses are described in Sect. 2, followed by the event reconstruction and selection in Sect. 3. The measurement methodology for both the inclusive and differential cross-sections is described in Sect. 4, and the evaluation of systematic uncertainties in Sect. 5. The inclusive cross-section results are given in Sect. 6, together with the derivation of the top quark pole mass from \u03c3 tt , and the corresponding tt and tt/Z cross-section ratios. The differential cross-section results are discussed in Sect. 7, and compared with the predictions of several tt event generators. Finally, conclusions are discussed in Sect. 8.",

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid producing a 2T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and an external muon spectrometer incorporating three large toroidal magnet assemblies. The analysis was performed on samples of protonproton collision data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to total integrated luminosities of 3.2 fb \u22121 in 2015 and 32.9 fb \u22121 in 2016 after data quality requirements. Events were required to pass a single-electron or single-muon trigger [33,34], with transverse momentum thresholds that were progressively raised during the datataking as the instantaneous luminosity increased. The electron trigger was fully efficient for electrons with reconstructed p T > 25 GeV in 2015 and the first 6 fb \u22121 of 2016 data, and for p T > 27 GeV for the remainder. The corresponding muon trigger thresholds were p T > 21 GeV for 2015 data, p T > 25 GeV for the first 6 fb \u22121 of 2016 data and p T > 27 GeV for the rest. Each triggered event also includes the signals from on average 14 (25) additional inelastic pp collisions in 2015 (2016) data, referred to as pileup.",

            "text": "Alternative tt simulation samples used to assess systematic uncertainties were generated with Powheg interfaced to Herwig7 (v7.0.4) [47] with the H7UE tune, and with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (v2.3.3.p1) generator (referred to hereafter as aMC@NLO) [48] with the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set, interfaced to Pythia8 with the A14 tune. In the aMC@NLO sample, the renormalisation and factorisation scales were set in the same way as for Powheg, and the MC@NLO prescription [49] was used for matching the NLO matrix element to the parton shower. Uncertainties related to the amount of initial-and final-state radiation were explored using two alternative Powheg + Pythia8 samples: one with h damp set to 3m t , \u03bc F and \u03bc R reduced by a factor of two from their default values, and the A14v3cUp tune variation, giving more parton-shower radiation; and a second sample with h damp = 3 2 m t , \u03bc F and \u03bc R increased by a factor of two and the A14v3cDo tune variation, giving less parton-shower radiation. These parameter variations were chosen in order to reproduce differential cross-section and jet multiplicity distributions measured in tt events, as discussed in Ref. [46]. The top quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV in all these samples, consistent with measurements from ATLAS [50] and CMS [51]. The W \u2192 \u03bd branching ratio was set to the Standard Model prediction of 0.1082 per lepton flavour [52], and the EvtGen program [53] was used to handle the decays of band c-flavoured hadrons. All the samples were normalised using the NNLO+NNLL inclusive cross-section prediction discussed in Sect. 1 when comparing simulation with data. Additional tt samples with different event generator configurations were used in comparisons with the measured normalised differential cross-sections as discussed in Sect. 7.2. Backgrounds in these measurements are classified into two types: those with two real prompt leptons (electrons or muons) from W or Z boson decays (including those produced by leptonic decays of \u03c4 -leptons), and those where at least one of the reconstructed leptons is misidentified, i.e. a non-prompt lepton from the decay of a bottom or charm hadron, an electron from a photon conversion, a hadronic jet misidentified as an electron, or a muon produced from the decay in flight of a pion or kaon. The background with two real prompt leptons is dominated by the associated production of a W boson and single top quark, W t. This process was simulated using Powheg v1 [54] with the CT10 NLO PDF set [18], interfaced to Pythia6 (v6.428) [55] with the P2012 tune [56]. The 'diagram removal' scheme [57] was used to handle the interference between the tt and W t final states that occurs at NLO. The sample was normalised to a cross-section of 71.7 \u00b1 3.8 pb, based on the approximate NNLO calculation [58,59] using the MSTW2008 NNLO PDF set [16,17], and taking into account PDF and QCD scale uncertainties. Smaller backgrounds result from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 (\u2192 e\u03bc)+jets, and from diboson production (W W , W Z and Z Z) in association with jets. These backgrounds were modelled using Sherpa 2.2.1 [60] (Z +jets) and Sherpa 2.1.1 (dibosons), as discussed in Ref. [61]. Production of tt in association with a leptonically decaying W , Z or Higgs boson gives a negligible contribution to the opposite-sign e\u03bc samples compared to inclusive tt production, but is significant in the same-sign control samples used to assess the background from misidentified leptons. These processes were simulated using aMC@NLO + Pythia8 (tt + W/Z ) or Powheg + Pythia8 (tt + H ) [61].",

The contributions via leptonic \u03c4 decays (t \u2192 W \u2192 \u03c4 \u2192 e/\u03bc) are included. The lepton four-momenta were taken after final-state radiation, and 'dressed' by including the four-momenta of any photons within a cone of size R = 0.1 around the lepton direction, excluding photons produced from hadron decays or interactions with the detector material. The reconstruction efficiency G e\u03bc represents the probability that the two leptons are reconstructed and pass all the identification and isolation requirements. A fiducial cross-section \u03c3 fid tt , for the production of tt events with an electron and a muon satisfying the requirements on p T and \u03b7, can then be defined as \u03c3 fid tt = A e\u03bc \u03c3 tt , and measured by replacing \u03c3 tt e\u03bc with \u03c3 fid tt G e\u03bc in Eq.

(1) allows the number of tt events with no reconstructed and b-tagged jets to be inferred from the event counts N 1 and N 2 . Measurement of the fiducial cross-section avoids the systematic uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the acceptance, in particular estimation of the fraction of tt \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bdbb events where at least one lepton has p T < 20 GeV or |\u03b7| > 2.5.

They were subdivided according to the number of b-tagged jets, irrespective of the number of untagged jets. The numbers of events with one and two b-tagged jets in each sample are shown in Table 2, together with the expected non-tt contributions from W t and dibosons evaluated from simulation, and Z (\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc)+jets and misidentified leptons evaluated using both data and simulation. The one b-tag sample is expected to be about 88% pure and the two b-tag sample 96% pure in tt events, with the largest backgrounds in both samples coming from W t production. The distribution of the number of b-tagged jets is shown for the 2015 and 2016 data samples together in Fig. 1a, and compared with the expectations from simulation, broken down into contributions from tt events (modelled using the baseline Powheg + Pythia8 sample), and various background processes. The predictions using alternative tt generator configurations (Powheg + Pythia8 with more or less parton-shower radiation, denoted by 'RadUp' and 'RadDn', and aMC@NLO + Pythia8) are also shown. All expected contributions are normalised to the integrated luminosity of the data sample using the cross-sections discussed in Sects. 1 and 2. The excess of data events over the prediction in the zero b-tagged jets sample (which is not used in the measurement) was also observed previously [7,9] and is compatible with the expected uncertainties in modelling diboson and Z +jets production.",

The production of a Z boson accompanied by heavy-flavour jets is subject to large theoretical uncertainties, so the background contributions in the one and two b-tag samples predicted by Sherpa (normalised to the inclusive Z cross-section predictions from FEWZ [72]) were further scaled by factors of 1.10 \u00b1 0.12 (one b-tag) and 1.20 \u00b1 0.12 (two b-tags) obtained from data. These scale factors were derived from the ratio of data to simulation event yields for Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc accompanied by one or by two b-tagged jets. The Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc yields were obtained by requiring two opposite-sign electrons or muons passing the selections detailed in Sect. 3, and performing a template fit to the dilepton invariant mass distribution in the range 30 < m < 150 GeV in order to subtract the contributions from tt events and misidentified leptons. The uncertainties are dominated by variations in the scale factors as functions of Z boson p T . Further uncertainties of 5% in the one b-tag sample and 23% in the two b-tag sample were assigned from the change in the final background prediction when replacing the Sherpa sample with one generated using MadGraph [73] interfaced to Pythia8, including re-evaluation of the scale factors. Similar procedures were used to evaluate the uncertainty in the Z +jets background prediction in every bin of the differential distributions, including a comparison of the per-bin predictions from Sherpa and Madgraph after normalising each sample to data in the inclusive Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc control regions.",

Table 3 shows that the simulation reproduces the observed numbers of same-sign events Table 3 Breakdown of estimated misidentified-lepton contributions in simulation to the one (1b) and two (2b) b-tag opposite-and same-sign (OS and SS) e\u03bc event samples from 2015 and 2016 separately. The various misidentified-lepton categories are described in Sect. 4.3, and the contributions labelled 'Other' include all sources other than photon conversions and heavy-flavour decays. For the same-sign samples, the estimated contributions of wrong-sign (where the electron charge sign is misidentified) and right-sign prompt lepton events are also shown, and the total expectations are compared with the data. The uncertainties are due to the limited size of the simulated samples, and values or uncertainties shown as zero are less than 0.5 events well, and the distributions shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that it also reproduces the general features of the lepton kinematic distributions, the largest differences in individual bins being around 20%. These studies validate the overall modelling of misidentified leptons by the simulation, even though the background estimates determined via Eq. (6) do not rely on the simulation providing an accurate estimate of the absolute rates of such events. Additional studies were performed using same-sign control samples with relaxed electron or muon isolation criteria (increasing the relative contribution of heavy-flavour decays), and changing the lepton selection to p T > 40 GeV (enhancing the fraction of photon conversions), and a similar level of agreement was seen both in rates and distribution shapes. The ratios R j in Eq. (6) were evaluated to be R 1 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 and R 2 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.9 for the 2015 data sample, and R 1 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.4 and R 2 = 1.9 \u00b1 1.0 for the 2016 sample. The uncertainties encompass the range of R j values seen for the major sources of misidentified-lepton events; as can be seen from the entries in Table 3, the opposite-to same-sign event count ratios are different for the main categories, and the uncertainty allows for their relative contributions to be different from that predicted by the baseline simulation. The R j values seen in the control samples with loosened isolation, and the predictions from alternative tt simulation samples using Pythia6 or Herwig7 instead of Pythia8 hadronisation were also considered. A conservative 50% uncertainty in the prompt lepton same-sign contribution was also taken into account, covering the mismodelling of electron charge misidentification in simulation and the uncertainties in the predicted cross-sections for tt + V and diboson processes. The final misidentified-lepton background estimates for the 2015 and 2016 opposite-sign data samples in the inclusive cross-section analysis are shown in Table 2. Figure 4 shows the corresponding same-sign event distributions for the dilepton variables, showing a similar quality of modelling of these kinematic distributions by the simulation as seen for the single-lepton variables in Fig. 3.

These tests demonstrated that the method is unbiased and correctly estimates the statistical uncertainties in each bin of each distribution. The simulation prediction is normalised to the same integrated luminosity as the data, and broken down into contributions where both leptons are prompt, or one is a misidentified lepton from a photon conversion originating from a top quark decay or from background, from heavy-flavour decay or from other sources. The statistical uncertainty in the total simulation prediction is significant in some bins, and is shown by the hatching. In the p T distributions, the last bin includes the overflows filled black points show the relative differences between the mean normalised differential cross-sections obtained from 1000 pseudo-experiments and the true cross-sections in each bin, divided by the true cross-sections to give fractional differences. The pseudo-experiments were generated from a reference tt sample, and the reference sample was also used to determine the values of G i e\u03bc and C i b in each bin i of the distributions. The compatibility of the filled black points with zero within the statistical uncertainty of the reference sample confirms that the method is unbiased for this sample. The open red points and dotted lines show the mean pseudo-experiment results and true values for an alternative sample with different underlying distributions, again expressed as fractional deviations from the true cross-sections in the reference sample, and obtained using G i e\u03bc and C i b values from the reference sample. The alternative samples were chosen in order to produce a large variation in the distribution under test. An independent tt simulation sample with m t = 175 GeV was used for the p T and p e\u03bc T distributions, and the baseline tt sample generated with NNPDF3.0 was reweighted to the predictions of the CT14 PDF set [74] for |\u03b7 | and |y e\u03bc |. In all cases, the results are consistent with the true values within the statistical uncertainties of the alternative samples, demonstrating that the simple bin-by-bin correction procedure correctly recov-   and L appearing in Eq.

The sources of systematic uncertainty are divided into the five groups discussed below, and are shown in detail for the inclusive and fiducial tt cross-sections in Table 4.

The tt generator uncertainty was determined by comparing the baseline Powheg + Pythia8 sample with aMC@NLO + Pythia8. The parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event uncertainty (referred to as 'hadronisation' below) was evaluated by comparing the baseline with Powheg + Her-wig7. The initial/final-state radiation uncertainty was evaluated as half the difference between the Powheg + Pythia8 model variations with more or less parton-shower radiation; as discussed in Sect. 2, these samples also include variations of \u03bc F and \u03bc R . As shown in Table 4, the tt generator uncertainty is larger for e\u03bc than for G e\u03bc , as the Powheg + Pythia8 and aMC@NLO + Pythia8 samples predict different particle-level acceptances A e\u03bc . In contrast, the differences in A e\u03bc and G e\u03bc for the tt hadronisation uncertainty have opposite signs, leading to a smaller shift in e\u03bc than in G e\u03bc . In the differential analyses, the bin-by-bin shifts in G i e\u03bc and C i b were fitted with polynomial functions to reduce statistical fluctuations. All these comparisons were carried out without applying the lepton isolation requirements, as the isolation efficiencies were measured in situ in data as discussed in Sect. 5.2, and the simulation was only used to predict the lepton reconstruction, identification and overlap removal uncertainties. This procedure also reduces the sensitivity to the modelling of hadronisation, the underlying event and colour reconnection.",

The potential effect on C b was studied by reweighting the baseline Powheg + Pythia8 tt sample so as to increase the fraction of events with at least three b-jets at generator level by 40%, an enhancement which reproduces both the rate of events with three b-tags and the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the third highestp T b-tagged jet in these events.

The values of C b and C i b also depend weakly on the efficiencies for tagging both heavy-and light-flavoured jets. The modelling of the b-tagging performance in simulation was corrected using scale factors determined using dileptonic tt events for b-jets [70], single-lepton tt events for charm jets [80], and dijet events for light-quark and gluon jets [81]. The corresponding uncertainties were propagated to the background and correlation coefficient estimates. The uncertainties related to jets and b-tagging are shown by the purple dashed lines in Fig. 6, and are dominated by the effects of b-tagging uncertainties on the background estimates.",

Further modelling uncertainties were assessed by comparing the predictions from the baseline W t sample with those of aMC@NLO interfaced to Herwig++ [84], with Powheg + Pythia6 samples with more or less parton-shower radiation, and with Powheg + Herwig7, in all cases normalising the total production cross-section to the approximate NNLO prediction.

A 0.1% variation in \u221a s corresponds to a 0.23% variation in \u03c3 tt , according to the NNLO+NNLL predictions of Top++ [14]. Following the approach of previous analyses [7,9], this uncertainty is included in the experimental uncertainty of \u03c3 tt , allowing the measurement to be compared with theoretical predictions for \u03c3 tt at exactly \u221a s = 13 TeV. The beam energy uncertainty also affects the predictions for both the absolute and normalised differential distributions, as e.g. the lepton p T distributions become slightly harder and the |\u03b7 | distributions slightly more forward as \u221a s increases. These shifts were evaluated by reweighting the aMC@NLO + Pythia8 tt sample using PDF weights calculated using LHAPDF [89] so as to vary the effective \u221a s by \u00b10.1%, and the resulting uncertainties were included in the differential cross-section results.

The analyses were initially performed 'blind' by multiplying the \u03c3 tt values by an unknown, randomly chosen scale factor which was only removed after verifying that consistent results were obtained from the 2015 and 2016 datasets, and after finalising all systematic uncertainties and stability studies. As a validation of the analysis procedures, the yields of Z \u2192 ee Table 5 Measurements of the inclusive total (\u03c3 tt ) and fiducial (\u03c3 fid tt ) tt production cross-sections at \u221a s = 13 TeV using the full dataset, the 2015 and 2016 datasets separately, and the combination of the 2015 and 2016 measurements. The fiducial cross-section requires an opposite-sign e\u03bc pair, with both leptons having p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, as discussed in Sect. 4.1. The four uncertainties for each measurement correspond to the statistical, experimental and theoretical systematic, integrated luminosity, and beam energy uncertainties. The total uncertainty is given in parentheses after each result and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc selections relative to the expectations from Powheg + Pythia8-based Z \u2192 simulation were also compared across all data-taking periods and trigger selections, and found to be compatible within the assigned systematic and very small statistical uncertainties. Table 5 shows the results for \u03c3 tt and \u03c3 fid tt from the entire 2015-2016 dataset treated as a single sample, the 2015 and 2016 datasets separately, and the combination of 2015 and 2016 results. The latter was performed using the best linear unbiased estimator technique [90,91], taking into account correlations in the systematic uncertainties. The combination gives the smallest total uncertainty, 9% smaller than that from all data treated as one sample, and gives the final results: \u03c3 tt = 826.4 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b1 11.5 \u00b1 15.7 \u00b1 1.9 pb, and \u03c3 fid tt = 14.07 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 pb, where the four uncertainties are due to data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects internal to the analysis, the knowledge of the integrated luminosity, and the knowledge of the LHC beam energy. The total relative uncertainties are 2.4% for both \u03c3 tt and \u03c3 fid tt . The 2015 and 2016 datasets have relative weights of 0.49 and 0.51. The uncertainties due to the luminosity are only partially correlated and are similar in magnitude in both datasets, leading to approximately equal weights despite the much larger data sample from 2016. Other uncertainties are largely correlated between the two datasets, except for the statistical components of uncertainties estimated from data, such as the electron and muon identification efficiencies, and the misidentified-lepton background estimate. The \u03c7 2 for the combination of 2015 and 2016 data is 0.23 for one degree of freedom, demonstrating good compatibility of the results. The values of b obtained in 2015 data and simulation are very similar, and 1.6% lower in 2016 data than simulation, well within the expected uncertainties in the modelling of b-tagging performance [70]. The result for \u03c3 tt is reported for a fixed top quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV, and depends on the assumed value according to (1/\u03c3 tt ) d\u03c3 tt /dm t = \u22120.20%/GeV. The m t dependence of \u03c3 fid tt is negligible. The fiducial cross-section was also corrected to remove the contribution of events with leptons from leptonic \u03c4 decays as discussed in Sect. 4.2, giving a result of \u03c3 fid tt,no\u2212\u03c4 = 12.05\u00b10.05\u00b10.16\u00b10.23\u00b10.03 pb. The breakdown of statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurements is given in Table 4, which also shows the average uncertainty contributions to e\u03bc and C b , weighted as in the combination. The largest uncertainties come from the calibration of the integrated luminosity, followed by tt modelling (generator, hadronisation, radiation and PDFs), background modelling (W t single-top crosssection and misidentified leptons), and lepton identification efficiencies. The uncertainties due to tt generator choices and PDFs are smaller for \u03c3 fid tt than for \u03c3 tt , but are offset by a larger uncertainty due to tt hadronisation, such that the total uncertainties in the two measurements are very similar.",

The results are also stable when tightening the jet selection to |\u03b7| < 1.0 and changing the b-tagging selection to use the 60% or 77% efficiency working points. However, a significant trend was found when tightening the lepton p T requirement from the nominal p T > 20 GeV in several steps up to p T > 55 GeV, where e\u03bc is reduced by a factor 4.4 and \u03c3 tt changes by \u22123.9 \u00b1 0.7%, the uncertainty corresponding to the uncorrelated statistical component only. This is caused by the lepton p T spectrum in data being significantly softer than that in the baseline Powheg + Pythia8 simulation (see Fig. 1c, e, and Fig. 12a below). As discussed in Sect. 7.2 and shown in Fig. 16, the p T distribution is better described by the alternative aMC@NLO + Pythia8 tt sample, or by reweighting the baseline Powheg + Pythia8 sample to better describe the measured top quark p T spectrum [92]. Using either of these tt samples to calculate e\u03bc increases the measured \u03c3 tt with a lepton p T > 20 GeV requirement by about 0.5%, and greatly improves the stability of the result against changes in the lepton p T requirement. Since this change is similar  , with the LHC beam energy uncertainties reduced according to Ref. [88] to the already assigned tt modelling uncertainties (in particular from the aMC@NLO vs Powheg comparison), no additional uncertainty was included.",

The likelihood in Eq. 7was maximised to obtain m pole t when using the CT14 NNLO PDF set to calculate \u03c3 theo tt , and also when using the NNPDF3.1_notop NNLO PDF set, with \u03b1 S uncertainties inferred from NNPDF3.1 as discussed in Sect. 6.1. Results were also obtained using the individual CT10, MSTW and NNPDF2.3 NNLO PDF sets to calculate \u03c3 theo tt , for comparison with the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV results. The MMHT and NNPDF3.0 PDF sets were not considered, as they include tt cross-section data in order to constrain the gluon PDF, and hence cannot also be used to determine m pole t without introducing a circular dependence [95]. In each case, the value of \u03c3 tt was recalculated using the corresponding NLO PDF set to calculate the value of e\u03bc . The results from each PDF set are shown in Table 6, together with the result using the PDF4LHC prescription to combine the CT10, MSTW and NNPDF2.3 results, keeping the CT10 central value but enlarging the uncertainty to cover the envelope of the positive and negative uncertainties of each individual PDF set. The NNPDF3.1_notop PDF set gives the smallest uncertainty of \u00b11.7 GeV, demonstrating the power of recent improvements in the gluon PDF determination to reduce the uncertainty on m pole t . However, given the approximate procedure used to evaluate the \u03b1 S uncertainty for this PDF set, the CT14 PDF set was chosen for the baseline result. Table 7 shows the breakdown of uncertainties in m   butions [29], and via the reconstruction of top quark differential distributions in inclusive tt [96] and tt +jet [97,98] events, as well as previous measurements using the total tt cross-section [7,10,12,13,94]. It is also consistent with the Particle Data Group average of m pole t = 173.1 \u00b1 0.9 GeV [99] from a subset of these measurements. The result using the CT14 PDF improves upon the previous ATLAS result from \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data using the CT10, MSTW and NNPDF2.3 PDFs combined with the PDF4LHC prescription [7]. However, using the PDF4LHC prescription with the \u221a s = 13 TeV data gives a larger uncertainty of +3.1 \u22122.0 GeV, as the prediction of \u03c3 tt from NNPDF2.3 starts to diverge from that of CT10 and MSTW at higher \u221a s (see Fig. 8), leading to a larger spread in the m t values from the different PDF sets.",

[7], corrected to reduce the LHC beam energy uncertainty to 0.1% [88]. The \u03c3 tt values and uncertainties are summarised in Table 8; the largest systematic uncertainties come in all cases from tt modelling and the knowledge of the integrated luminosity. As the nominal tt simulation sample used at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV was Powheg + Pythia6 with the CT10 PDFs, the \u221a s = 13 TeV result was rederived using a similar tt sample to calculate e\u03bc and C b , increasing the 13 TeV \u03c3 tt value by 0.46%. PDF uncertainties were evaluated for each of the error sets or replicas of the CT10, MSTW and NNPDF2.3 PDF sets, considering the effect of each individual variation to be correlated between the numerator and denominator of the \u03c3 tt ratio. Significant cancellations occur, leading to PDF uncertainties of about 0.5% in each ratio, significantly smaller than the 1% uncertainties for the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV \u03c3 tt measurements. The parton-shower radiation uncertainties were similarly evaluated using Powheg + Pythia6 samples with more and less parton-shower radiation in all datasets, giving residual uncertainties of around 0.4% in the ratios. Other tt modelling uncertainties due to the choice of NLO generator and hadronisation model were conservatively taken to be uncorrelated, due to the different alternative generators used in the measurements. The uncertainties due to the W t background cross-section and tt/W t interference were assessed in the same way at all \u221a s values and considered correlated. Lepton, jet and b-tagging uncertainties were mainly considered uncorrelated, due to the changes in detector configuration and lepton identification algorithms between measurements. The integrated luminosity measurements were based on different primary detectors at 7-8 TeV and 13 TeV, and the luminosity scale was calibrated using individual beam-separation scans  Ratios of inclusive tt production cross-sections measured at \u221a s = 13, and TeV, together with the corresponding NNLO+NNLL predictions using Top++ [14] with the PDF4LHC prescription for PDF and \u03b1 S uncertainties [15]. The three uncertainties in the measured ratios are due to data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects (including the LHC beam energy uncertainties) and knowledge of the integrated luminosities of the data samples. The ratio of \u221a s = 8 and 7 TeV results is taken from Ref. [7]. The total uncertainty is given in parentheses after each result  Fig. 8) leads to a small (< 0.1%) residual uncertainty on the ratios.",

The total uncertainties in the measurements are 3.9% for R tt 13/7 and 3.6% for R tt 13/8 , improving on the uncertainties of 4.9% and 4.7% obtained using the 2015 \u221a s = 13 TeV dataset alone in Ref. [27]. Figure 10 compares the measurements with the predictions using the CT10, MSTW and NNPDF2.3 PDF sets, as well as the more recent CT14 [74], ABM12LHC [102], ABMP16 [103], ATLAS-epWZ12 [104], HERA-PDF2.0 [105], MMHT14 [77] and NNPDF3.0 [44] PDF sets, some of which include some LHC data (including tt cross-section measurements in the cases of ABM12LHC, ABMP16, MMHT and NNPDF3.0). The ratio R tt 13/7 is lower than all the predictions, and the ratio R tt 13/8 higher than all the predictions except ABM12LHC. However, both ratios are compatible with all the predictions except ABM12LHC within two standard deviations. Some of these results are also reflected in Fig. 8. The behaviour of ABM12LHC is attributed to the lower gluon density at high Bjorken-x compared to the other considered PDF sets, which leads to a larger relative increase in the tt cross-section as a function of \u221a s. This behaviour is less apparent in the more recent ABMP16 PDF set, which includes more precise constraints from LHC top quark measurements. The current experimental uncertainties, dominated by the luminosity uncertainties which do not cancel in the ratios, do not allow the predictions using the other PDFs to be distinguished.",

The largest uncertainties come from the \u03c3 tt measurements, in particular the tt modelling uncertainties, which are mainly treated as uncorrelated between beam energies. Excluding PDF uncertainties, where the correlations between beam energies are fully accounted for, tt modelling uncertainties contribute 1.7% and 1.4% to the uncertainties on the ratios R tt/Z 13/7 and R tt/Z 13/8 . In principle, these uncertainties could be reduced by using a fully coherent set of tt simulation samples and uncertainty model at all beam energies, but that has not been attempted here.",

The measurement of the tt/Z cross-section ratio at \u221a s = 13 TeV is compatible with all the predictions within two standard deviations. Although the experimental uncertainty is only 1.7%, the predictions have common uncertainties of +4.0 \u22124.6 % from QCD scale and top quark mass variations, limiting the sensitivity to PDF variations. The pattern for the double ratios is similar to that seen for the tt-only ratios in Fig. 10; the normalisation to Z \u2192 cross-sections serves mainly to reduce the luminosity-related uncertainties. The double ratio R tt/Z 13/7 lies below all the predictions, and R tt/Z 13/8 lies above all the predictions except that of ABM12LHC. However, the measurements are consistent with all the predictions within two standard deviations, with the exception of ABM12LHC for R tt/Z 13/7 . Similar trends were seen in Ref.

The same data sample has been used to measure eight single-differential and three double-differential cross-sections as a function of lepton and dilepton kinematic variables, with uncertainties as small as 0.6% for normalised distributions in some parts of the fiducial region. The measured distributions are generally well described by the NLO matrix-element generators Powheg and aMC@NLO when interfaced to Pythia or Herwig for parton shower, hadronisation and underlying-event modelling. However, the Powheg-based predictions give lepton p T spectra that are significantly harder than those observed in data, and none of the predictions describe the low-mass part of the dilepton invariant mass distribution.
