            "text": "In the energy range between the mass of the \u03c8(3770) (just above the smallest open charm production threshold of D 0D0 ) and 4.7 GeV, which contains quite a few open charm production thresholds, several vector charmonium-like structures (known as Y states, e.g. Y (4260), Y (4360), Y (4660) ...) have been discovered in e + e \u2212 annihilation into hidden-charm final states [1][2][3][4][5][6]over the past decade. Their strong coupling to the hidden-charm final states and the difficulty in fitting all of the Y states to the potential model prediction [7] indicates that they could be exotic particle candidates, like hybrids, tetraquarks, meson molecules and so on [8]. The exclusive cross sections of e + e \u2212 annihilation into open charm final states could give the detailed coupling strength of these charmonium-like states to the open charm final states and could help in understanding the nature of these charmonium-like states. Such exclusive open charm cross sections have been measured by the BaBar [9][10][11] and Belle [12][13][14][15][16][17] experiments through initial state radiation (ISR) and by the CLEO-c [18] experiment with a set of scan data. The errors in CLEO-c's results are relatively small but the observed exclusive cross sections are not corrected for the radiative correction. As the event selection efficiency in this CLEO-c measurement does not depend on the radiative correction, it is possible to apply the radiative correction directly to the observed cross sections to get the Born cross sections, which have a clear definition and are more convenient in result comparison and theoretical application.",

[18]), which have no modification to the line shape and in turn the ISR correction factors. (For e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0D0 and D + D \u2212 , the systematic errors should be treated in the same way as the statistical errors, since Belle data are involved and their systematic errors are independent of those of the CLEO-c data.) While considering the statistical errors of the observed cross sections which are independent between energy points, the line shape and the obtained dressed cross sections could be different. To investigate the effects of the statistical errors of the observation on the dressed cross sections, we perform samplings of the \u03c3 dre 0 (s) according to a Gaussian distribution at each energy point, where the mean value and the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution are the central value and the statistical error of the observed cross section, respectively.
