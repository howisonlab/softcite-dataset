Comparison of observables like jet production rates or event shape variables with theoretical predictions allows the crucial free parameter of QCD-the strong coupling \u03b1 S -to be determined. The determination of \u03b1 S from many different observables provides an important consistency test of QCD. Recently, significant progress in the theoretical calculation of event shape observables has been made. Next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations are now available [8,9] as well as NNLO calculations matched with resummed terms in the next-to-leadinglogarithmic-approximation (NLLA) [10].",

This was followed by measurements between \u221a s = 14 GeV and \u221a s = 44 GeV [12] and between \u221a s = 91 GeV and \u221a s = 206 GeV [13] based on comparing JADE or ALEPH data with NNLO plus matched NLLA calculations. The strong coupling has also been determined at NNLO from the threejet rate at LEP [14]. In the present study, the revised NNLO calculations described in [8,9] are used to determine \u03b1 S at NNLO and NNLO + NLLA for 13 different energy values between 91 and 209 GeV. The data sample is that of the OPAL Collaboration at LEP. Hadronization corrections are treated in the manner described in [2,11,12,15]. The study is based on the same measurements of event shape variables, the same fit ranges (except for y D 23 as discussed below), and the same Monte Carlo models for detector and hadronization corrections as those in [15].",

Four-fermion background processes were simulated using grc4f 2.1 [24], KORALW 1.42 [25] with grc4f [24] matrix elements, with hadronization performed using PYTHIA. The above samples, generated at each energy point studied, were processed through a full simulation of the OPAL detector [26] and reconstructed in the same manner as the data. In addition, when correcting for the effects of hadronization, large samples of generator-level Monte Carlo events were employed, using the parton shower models PYTHIA 6.158, HERWIG 6.2 and ARIADNE 4.11 [27]. Each of these models used for the description of hadronization and detector response contains a number of tunable parameters.

To compare the QCD predictions with measured event shape distributions these predictions are corrected from the parton to the hadron level. The corrections are based on large samples of typically 10 7 events generated with the parton-shower Monte Carlo programs PYTHIA (used by default), HERWIG and ARIADNE (used to evaluate systematic uncertainties).

Hadronization: For the default analysis, PYTHIA is used to evaluate hadronization corrections (Sect. 4.2). As systematic variations, HERWIG and ARIADNE are used instead. The larger of the deviations is taken as the systematic uncertainty. It was observed in [46,47] that systematic uncertainties determined from the differences between the PYTHIA, HERWIG, and ARI-ADNE models are generally much larger than those that arise from varying the parameters of a given model. Theoretical uncertainties: The theoretical calculation of event shape observables is a finite power series in \u03b1 S . The uncertainties originating from missing higher order terms are assessed by changing the renormalization scale factor to x \u03bc = 0.5 and x \u03bc = 2.0. The rescaling variable is set to x L = 2/3 and x L = 3/2 (x L = 4/9 and x L = 9/4 in case of y D 23 ) [15]. The largest deviation with respect to the standard analysis is taken as the systematic uncertainty. A variation of the matching scheme is not studied because Rmatching is not available for NNLO + NLLA. The QCD calculations do not account for quark masses. As in [48] we studied mass effects at 91 GeV by performing the hadronization correction, excluding bb events at the parton level whilst including them at the hadron level. For the NLO and NNLO calculations with or without resummed logarithms, the resulting values of \u03b1 S (m Z 0 ) are larger by \u223c1% for 1 \u2212 T , C and y D 23 , by \u223c1.5% for B T and by \u223c2% for B W . They are smaller by \u223c0.5% for M H . This difference is always covered by the hadronization uncertainty. In [49] electroweak O(\u03b1 3 \u03b1 S ) corrections to event shapes are calculated. They comprise effects of initial state radiation, which in our approach are corrected for by Monte Carlo models. Further they include purely weak contributions which are at the per mil level and therefore not relevant for our level of precision.",

The fit results are in general not compatible within the combined statistical and experimental errors with the results when only the statistical covariance is used. These \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. values are smaller than those from employing the statistical covariances, however they still range up to 62 for B T . We return to this issue when we discuss the NNLO + NLLA fits below.    The results for \u03b1 S from the different event shape variables are remarkably consistent with each other, for each c.m. energy, as seen from Tables 11, 12 (but not in the case of the modified fit procedure whose results are shown in Table 5). We find root-mean-square (r.m.s.) values for \u03b1 S ( \u221a s) between 0.0012 at 183 GeV and 0.0044 at 202 GeV. The variations in \u03b1 S between the different variables are comparable to the total systematic uncertainties. The values of \u03b1 S are significantly larger at 91 GeV than at higher energies, providing evidence for the running of \u03b1 S . Theoretical uncertainties dominate at the Z 0 peak (except for y D 23 ), where the statistical uncertainties are small. Similarly, statistical un-  , and from the x \u03bc variation for 1 \u2212 T , B T , C. Compared with the NNLO analysis the values of \u03b1 S are lower by 0.4% on average, and the theoretical uncertainties are higher by 33%. Larger scale uncertainties are expected to arise at 91 GeV when the NLLA terms are added to the NNLO terms [10,13,50], because the NNLO calculation compensates for the variation of the renormalization scale in two loops, while the NLLA term compensates for the variation in only one loop. The difference we observe between \u03b1 S in the NNLO and NNLO + NLLA studies is smaller than the corresponding difference observed between the NLO and NLO + NLLA studies (Sect. 6.5), as predicted in [10]. This difference is also smaller than that observed at lower energies [12], as expected from the energy evolution of \u03b1 S .",

The experimental uncertainties are determined assuming that the smaller of a pair of correlated experimental uncertainties gives the size of the fully correlated uncertainty. The minimum overlap assumption results in a conservative estimate of the total uncertainty. The hadronization and theoretical systematic uncertainties are evaluated by repeating the combination with changed input values, i.e. using a different hadronization model or the different value of x \u03bc or x L that yields the maximum deviation.

This procedure is further explained in [2,15]. We assume the hadronization uncertainties to be partially correlated. The \u03c7 2 probability of the average for a running (constant) coupling in the NNLO + NLLA study is 0.59 (6 \u00d7 10 \u221213 ). The corresponding result for the NNLO study is 0.56 (2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). We interpret this as clear   evidence, from OPAL data alone, for the running of \u03b1 S in the manner predicted by QCD. We evolve the results in Table 7 with \u221a s > m Z 0 to a common scale m Z 0 using the QCD formula for the running of \u03b1 S . The results are then combined using the uncertaintyweighted averaging procedure mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 8 for the NNLO and NNLO + NLLA analyses. The consistency between these values and the results from 91 GeV (Table 7) demonstrates the compatibility of the data with the running predicted by QCD. The high energy data have smaller theoretical and hadronization uncertainties, and therefore complement the statistically superior 91 GeV data.",

The more complete NNLO or NNLO + NLLA QCD predictions thus lead to smaller theoretical uncertainties in our analysis. Adding the NLLA terms to the NNLO predictions significantly improves the description of the data. The standard procedure to quantify theoretical uncertainties leads, however, to somewhat larger uncertainties in most of the NNLO + NLLA fits.      ",

All event shape distributions are described reasonably well by the fitted predictions. The \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. values, which are large for the data at the Z 0 peak because they are based on statistical uncertainties only, range from 0.03 for y D 23 at \u221a s = 191.6 GeV to 228 for B T at \u221a s = 91.3 GeV. The uncertainties at this point are dominated by the experimental systematic uncertainties (discussed below). To check how the inclusion of the experimental errors in the fits reduces the large \u03c7 2 values, an alternative \u03c7 2 value is defined as follows.
