The branching fractions are determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp) = (2.112 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.031) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 nn) = (2.07 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Distributions of the angle \u03b8 between the proton or anti-neutron and the beam direction are well described by the form 1 + \u03b1 cos 2 \u03b8, and we find \u03b1 = 0.595 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b1 0.015 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp and \u03b1 = 0.50 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.21 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 nn. Our branching-fraction results suggest a large phase angle between the strong and electromagnetic amplitudes describing the J/\u03c8 \u2192 NN decay.",

            "text": "The J/\u03c8 meson is interpreted as a bound state of a charmed quark and a charmed antiquark (cc). The decay process J/\u03c8 \u2192 NN (N = p or n) is an octet-baryon-pair decay mode, and should be a good laboratory for testing perturbative QCD (pQCD) because the three gluons in the OZI-violating strong decay correspond to the three qq pairs that form the final-state nucleons. The ratio of the branching fractions for the pp and nn final states provides information about the phase angle between the strong and the electromagnetic (EM) amplitudes governing the decay [1][2][3]. Because the initial-state isospin is 0, the strong-decay amplitudes for the pp and nn final states must be equal. The J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp and J/\u03c8 \u2192 nn EM decays are expected to have amplitudes that are of about the same magnitude, but with opposite signs, like the magnetic moments (as discussed in Section VII). Because the EM decays of J/\u03c8 to pp and nn behave the same as non-resonant production of those final states, the magnitude of the EM decay amplitude of J/\u03c8 can be estimated from the cross section for continuum production e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp. If the strong and EM amplitudes are almost real, and therefore in phase, as predicted by pQCD [1][2][3][4][5], then interference would lead to a branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 nn about one-half as large as that for J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp. Conversely, if the strong and EM amplitudes are orthogonal, then the strong decay dominates and the branching fractions are expected to be equal. In previous experiments, J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp has been measured with good precision, while J/\u03c8 \u2192 nn has been measured with quite a large uncertainty [6,7]. They appear to be equal within errors, at odds with the pQCD expectation.",

A vertex fit is performed to the two selected tracks to improve the momentum resolution, and the angle between the p andp is required to be greater than 178 \u2022 . Finally, for both tracks, the measured momentum magnitude must be within 30 MeV/c (\u223c 3\u03c3) of the expected value of 1.232 GeV/c.

We measure differences between the data and MC separately for the efficiencies of tracking and particle identification, leaving the other selection cuts in place or tightening them for cleaner selection. The correlation between the corrections in the tracking and particle-identification efficiencies has been shown in MC studies to be small, so we combine them into a single correction function that is applied to the MC-determined efficiency.

In this case the momentum difference between the two n samples results in a greater difference in the EMC energy than was observed in then case. This disagreement is a source of systematic error, which we try to minimize by the use of the very loose energy cut on the n shower. For the E extra cut, we use J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp to obtain the efficiency (\u01eb data Eextra ). The requirements are identical to those described in Sect. V A.
