The MiniBooNE detector, 490 m downstream, is sensitive to dark matter via elastic scattering with nucleons in the detector mineral oil. Analysis methods developed for previous MiniBooNE scattering results were employed, and several constraining data sets were simultaneously analyzed to minimize systematic errors from neutrino flux and interaction rates. No excess of events over background was observed, leading to a 90% confidence limit on the dark-matter cross section parameter, Y = 2 \u03b1D(m\u03c7/mV ) 4 10 \u22128 , for \u03b1D = 0.5 and for dark-matter masses of 0.01 < m\u03c7 < 0.3 GeV in a vector portal model of dark matter. This is the best limit from a dedicated proton beam dump search in this mass and coupling range and extends below the mass range of direct dark matter searches. These results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to dark matter searches with beam dump experiments.",

A substantial program of experiments has evolved over the last several decades to search for non-gravitational interactions of DM, with yet no undisputed evidence in this sector. Most of these experiments target DM with weak scale masses and are less sensitive to DM with masses below a few GeV. To complement these approaches, new search strategies sensitive to DM with smaller masses should be considered [2].",

In these experiments, DM particles may be produced in collisions with nuclei in the fixed target, often a beam dump, and may be identified through interactions with nuclei in a downstream detector. Results from past beam dump experiments have been reanalyzed to place limits on the parameters within this class of models. In this Letter, we report on the first dedicated search of this type (proposed in [6]), which employs 8 GeV protons from the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB), reconfigured to reduce neutrino-induced backgrounds, combined with the downstream MiniBooNE (MB) neutrino detector ( Fig. 1).

With the assumption that DM scattering is purely elastic, the CCQE samples are free of DM-scattering events and, since they are well-measured via the large samples gathered in \u03bd-mode running, can be used to constrain the off-target neutrino flux. A sample of 956 CCQE events from off-target mode were reconstructed and compared to that predicted by the beam and detector simulations. The beam parameters input to the simulation were then adjusted, within their uncertainties, to reproduce that number of events and to improve the off-target flux estimate. A set of beam simulation variations, consistent with errors on the beam parameters and the total number of CCQE events, was created in order to determine the error on predicted fluxes.",

In particular, MB has measured \u03bd and \u03bd-nucleon neutral-current elastic (NCE) scattering [22,23] which has the same expected final state as \u03c7N scattering, allowing for the same mode of operation with well-understood detection and analysis methods. The MB detector [24] consists of 818 tons of mineral oil (CH 2 ) in a 610 cm-radius tank viewed by 1280 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in the inner, primary region and 240 PMTs arranged in pairs viewing the outer, optically separate, 35 cm thick veto region. Any PMTs with signal > 0.1 photoelectron are digitized and recorded in a 19.2 \u00b5s time window around the 1.6 \u00b5s BNB proton pulses. The signature of \u03c7N scattering events is a pattern of hits consistent with a track from a single proton or neutron of a few hundred MeV kinetic energy. The MB detector is sensitive to these sub-Cherenkov particles via a small amount of scintillation light emitted as they traverse the mineral oil. The event signature is the same as for previous \u03bd and \u03bd NCE cross section analyses performed by MB [22,23]. Analysis -A DM-candidate event sample was selected from the off-target data with selection criteria (\"cuts\") following the previous MB \u03bd-NCE analysis [23] and a reconstructed nucleon kinetic energy of 35 < T p < 600 MeV. This procedure requires exactly one time-cluster of hits coincident with the beam and with a time and spatial distribution consistent with a single nucleon and no pions. This selection, along with the requirement of no activity in the veto, minimizes contam-ination from beam-unrelated (cosmic) backgrounds and non-NCE beam-related backgrounds. Neutrino-induced NCE events are an irreducible background to this analysis; they must be estimated and subtracted. To better constrain the off-target neutrino flux and, therefore, the neutrino-induced backgrounds, the set of off-target CCQE events mentioned above was selected following cuts developed for our \u03bd-mode CCQE cross section measurement [25].",

The simulation, based on the model described in detail in Ref. [27], calculates rates for DM production and interactions in the detector as described in the introduction above. The attenuation of the \u03c7 flux in the beam dump and earth shield was calculated and is negligible for the model parameters considered here. The kinematic distributions of the particles involved for these mechanisms were obtained from the beam simulations. The energy distribution of the DM scattered nucleons from the DM simulation was used as input to the MB detector simulation which then could be used to calculate event efficiencies and generate a predicted nucleon energy distribution. In practice, since \u03c7N events have the same final-state signature as the NCE sample, existing simulation samples were used for a \u03c7N sample with an event-weight scaling based on the scattered nucleon energy. Only true NCE events were used for the DM signal. This is equivalent to assuming no DM interactions via resonant events and will result in a more conservative limit. The efficiency for a DM scattering event to be detected in this analysis is \u2248 35% for nucleon kinetic energy above \u2248 150 MeV but falls rapidly to < 1% at 50 MeV. In addition, the nucleons in carbon are subject to binding energy and final-state interactions further reducing the efficiency. The DM simulation of [27] does not include corrections for bound nucleons so they were applied using an effective efficiency calculated from the MB simulation which does account for those effects [25].",

In Fig. 7, with m V = 3m \u03c7 and \u03b1 D = 0.5, the 90% CL values for the dimensionless DM annihilation cross section parameter Y = 2 \u03b1 D (m \u03c7 /m V ) 4 may be plotted for this result and compared to different experimental exclusion regions. The choice of \u03b1 D = 0.5 is compatible with the bounds derived in Ref. [37] based on the running of the dark gauge coupling. However, it is important to note that the \u03c7 yield scales as 4 \u03b1 D . Thus for sufficiently small values of \u03b1 D the limits from other probes such as BaBar [32] will be stronger. With these DM parameter combinations, this result has expanded the search for DM to m \u03c7 values 2 orders of magnitude smaller than nucleon direct detection DM experiments and has excluded a vector mediator particle solution to the g \u2212 2 anomaly [30,31]. Within the context of the vector portal DM model and the chosen parameter constraints, this result sets the most stringent limits on DM in the range 0.08 < m \u03c7 < 0.3 GeV and, in a model where the DM does not couple to electrons [10], this limit is extended down to m \u03c7 \u2248 0.01 GeV.",
