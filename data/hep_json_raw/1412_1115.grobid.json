They are based on protonproton collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The measured inclusive cross section in the Z peak region (60-120 GeV), obtained from the combination of the dielectron and dimuon channels, is 1138 \u00b1 8 (exp) \u00b1 25 (theo) \u00b1 30 (lumi) pb, where the statistical uncertainty is negligible. The differential cross section d\u03c3/dm in the dilepton mass range 15-2000 GeV is measured and corrected to the full phase space. The double-differential cross section d 2 \u03c3/dm d|y| is also measured over the mass range 20 to 1500 GeV and absolute dilepton rapidity from 0 to 2.4. In addition, the ratios of the normalized differential cross sections measured at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV are presented. These measurements are compared to the predictions of perturbative QCD at next-to-leading and next-to-next-toleading (NNLO) orders using various sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The results agree with the NNLO theoretical predictions computed with fewz 3.1 using the CT10 NNLO and NNPDF2.1 NNLO PDFs. The measured double-differential cross section and ratio of normalized differential cross sections are sufficiently precise to constrain the proton PDFs.",

Hence, the rapidity and mass distributions are sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the interacting partons. The differential cross sections are measured with respect to |y| since the rapidity distribution is symmetric about zero. The high center-of-mass energy at the CERN LHC permits the study of DY production in regions of the Bjorken scaling variable and evolution scale Q 2 = x + x \u2212 s that were not accessible in previous experiments [5][6][7][8][9][10].

The theoretical systematic uncertainties in the cross section measurements for a given process at different center-of-mass energies are substantial but correlated, so that the ratios of differential cross sections normalized to the Z boson production cross section (double ratios) can be measured very precisely [11].",

The corresponding higher-order effects depend on the dilepton kinematic variables. Higher-order EW corrections are small in comparison to FSR corrections. They increase for invariant masses in the TeV region [33], but are insignificant compared to the experimental precision for the whole mass range under study. The NNLO QCD effects are most important in the low-mass region.

Non-QCD events, such as DY, are removed from the data sample using event selection and event subtraction based on simulation, leaving a sample of QCD events with characteristics similar to those in the analysis data sample. This sample is used to estimate the probability for a jet to pass the requirements of the electromagnetic trigger and to be falsely reconstructed as an electron. This probability is then applied to a sample of events with one electron and one jet to estimate the background contribution from an electron and a jet passing electron selection requirements. As the contribution from two jets passing the electron selections is considered twice in the previous method, the contribution from a sample with two jets multiplied by the square of the probability for jets passing the electron selection requirements is further subtracted. The QCD multijet background in the dimuon channel is evaluated by selecting a control data sample before the isolation and charge sign requirements are applied, following the method described in [49].",

As discussed in Sect. 7, single-lepton efficiencies of several types are measured with the tag-and-probe procedure and are combined into efficiency correction factors. The tag-and-probe procedure provides the efficiencies for each lepton type and the associated statistical uncertainties. A variety of possible systematic biases in the tag-and-probe procedure have been taken into account, such as dependence on the binning in single-lepton p T and \u03b7, dependence on the assumed shape of signal and background in the fit model, and the effect of pileup.
