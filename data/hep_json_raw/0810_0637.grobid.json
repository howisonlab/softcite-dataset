The experiment is dedicated to searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 decay and making precise lifetime measurements of 2\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 decay in seven isotopes. The main isotopes used for the 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 search are 7 kg of 100 Mo and 1 kg of 82 Se. There are smaller amounts of 116 Cd, 130 Te, 150 Nd, 96 Zr and 48 Ca for 2\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2 studies, and natural Te and Cu for background measurements. NEMO 3 employs an experimental technique of calorimetry and tracking, in order to detect the two final state electrons. The detector is cylindrical and is radially segmented into 20 equal sectors, each housing a thin source foil placed in the middle of a tracking volume, which is surrounded by the calorimeter. The tracker consists of 6180 drift cells operated in Geiger mode. The calorimeter walls are made up of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks coupled to low-radioactivity PMTs. They achieve energy resolution in the range 14%-17% FWHM for 1 MeV electrons and timing resolution of 250 ps. A solenoid magnetic field of 25 G is applied to provide charge identification. The whole detector is enclosed in a radon-free air tent, and covered by two levels of external radiation shielding.",
