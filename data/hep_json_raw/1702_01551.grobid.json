In addition there is indication of higher mass resonance production in \u03c8(2S) decays [5]. This is not necessarily the case in J/\u03c8 decays, but neither does the \u03c1(770) contribution saturate the spectrum. Attempts have been made to describe the J/\u03c8 decay distribution with additional partial waves [6]. It was found that interference effects are strong and even after adding \u03c0\u03c0 interactions up to \u2248 1.6 GeV/c 2 the description remained quite poor. Continuing to expand the partial wave basis to cover an even higher mass region would lead to a rather unconstrained analysis. On the other hand with the amplitudes developed in the Veneziano model, all partial waves are related to the same Regge trajectory, which gives a very strong constraint on the amplitude analysis [7].",

The BES III experiment [10] has performed an angular analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The analysis requires the presence of a broad J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 state in the K + K \u2212 threshold region, which is interpreted as a multiquark state. However Refs. [11,12] explain it by the interference between the \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700). On the other hand, the decay \u03c1(1450) \u2192 K + K \u2212 appears as \"not seen\" according to the PDG listing [13]. No Dalitz-plot analysis has been performed to date on the J/\u03c8 \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decay. We describe herein a study of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , J/\u03c8 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and J/\u03c8 \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays produced * Also at: Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News, Virginia 23606, USA \u2020 Now at: Wuhan University, Wuhan 43072, China \u2021 Now at: Universit\u00e0 di Bologna and INFN Sezione di Bologna, I-47921 Rimini, Italy \u00a7 Deceased \u00b6 Now at: University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK * * Now at: University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA \u2020 \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy in e + e \u2212 annihilation via initial-state radiation (ISR), where only resonances with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 can be produced. This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, a brief description of the BABAR detector is given. Section III is devoted to the event reconstruction and data selection. In Sec. IV, we describe the study of efficiency and resolution, while Sec. V is devoted to the measurement of the J/\u03c8 branching fractions. Section VI describes the Dalitz-plot analyses while in Sec. VII, we report the measurement of the \u03c1(1450) branching fraction. Finally we summarize the results in Sec. VIII.",

The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [15]. Charged particles are detected, and their momenta are measured, by means of a five-layer, double-sided microstrip detector, and a 40-layer drift chamber, both operating in the 1.5 T magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. Photons are measured and electrons are identified in a CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC). Charged-particle identification is provided by the specific energy loss in the tracking devices, and by an internally reflecting ringimaging Cherenkov detector. Muons are detected in the instrumented flux return of the magnet. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events [16], with sample sizes more than 10 times larger than the corresponding data samples, are used to evaluate signal efficiency and to determine background features.",

We observe prominent J/\u03c8 signals in both reactions and optimize the signal-to-background ratio using the data by retaining only selection criteria that do not remove significant J/\u03c8 signal. We require the energy of the less-energetic photon from \u03c0 0 decays to be greater than 100 MeV. Each pair of photons is kinematically fitted to a \u03c0 0 requiring it to emanate from the primary vertex of the event, and with the diphoton mass constrained to the nominal \u03c0 0 mass [13]. Due to the soft-photon background, we do not impose a veto on the presence of additional photons in the final state but we require exactly one \u03c0 0 candidate in each event. Particle identification is used in two different ways. For reaction (1), we require two oppositely charged particles to be loosely identified as pions.

We show in  Fig. 1, for events in the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ISR signal region, the distribution of \u03b8 ISR , the angle of the reconstructed ISR photon with respect to the e \u2212 beam direction in the laboratory system. We observe a narrow peak close to zero with a tail extending up to 140 0 while background events from J/\u03c8 sidebands are distributed over the full angular range. Since angular coverage of the EMC starts at \u03b8 > 23 0 , we improve the signal to background ratio for J/\u03c8 events where \u03b8 ISR > 23 0 , by removing events for which no photon shower is found in the EMC in the expected angular region. Therefore, we require the difference between the predicted polar and azimuthal angles from p ISR and the closest photon shower to be |\u2206\u03b8| < 0.1 rad and |\u2206\u03c6| < 0.05 rad. We do not use the information on the energy since some photons may not be fully contained in the EMC. For reaction (1) we define the helicity angle \u03b8 h as the angle in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 rest frame between the direction of the \u03c0 + and the boost from the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . We observe that residual background from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is concentrated at | cos \u03b8 \u03c0 | \u2248 1 and therefore we remove events having | cos \u03b8 \u03c0 | > 0.95. A very small J/\u03c8 signal is observed in the events removed by this selection. No evidence is found for background from the ISR reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR K + K \u2212 . Figure shows the M 2 rec distributions for the three reactions in the J/\u03c8 signal regions, in comparison to the corresponding M 2 rec distributions obtained from simulation. A peak at zero is observed in all distributions indicating the presence of the ISR process. We observe some discrepancy for reactions (1) and (2) due to some inaccuracy in reconstructing slow \u03c0 0 in the EMC. Figure 3 shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass spectra in the ISR region, before applying the efficiency correction. We observe strong J/\u03c8 signals over relatively small backgrounds and no more than one candidate per event. We perform a fit to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass spectra. Backgrounds are described by first-order polynomials, and each resonance is represented by a simple Breit-Wigner function convolved with the corresponding resolution function (see Sect. IV). Figure 3 shows the fit result, and Table II summarizes the mass values and yields. We observe (not taking into account systematic uncertainties) a J/\u03c8 mass shift of +2.9, +4.1, and -2.2 MeV/c 2 for the three decay modes.",

The ratios between the two minimum bias yields, corrected for the above efficiency loss gives directly the ratio of the two branching fractions which is in good agreement with the previous estimate.",

Figure 6 shows the projections of the estimated background contributions as shaded For the description of the J/\u03c8 Dalitz plot, amplitudes are added one at time to ascertain the associated increase of the likelihood value and decrease of the 2-D \u03c7 2 computed on the (m(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), cos \u03b8 h ) plane. We test the quality of the fit by examining a large sample of MC events at the generator level weighted by the likelihood fitting function and by the efficiency. These events are used to compare the fit result to the Dalitz plot and its projections with proper normalization. The latter comparison is shown in Fig. 6, and good agreement is obtained for all projections. We make use of these weighted events to compute a 2-D \u03c7 2 over the Dalitz plot. For this purpose, we divide the Dalitz plot into a number of cells such that the expected population in each cell is at least five events. We compute",

Also in this case we fit these sidebands using non-interfering amplitudes described by relativistic Breit-Wigner functions using the method of the channel likelihood [24]. The K * K contributions are symmetrized with respect to the kaon charge. Sideband regions are dominated by the presence of K * (892)K and K * 2 (1430)K amplitudes. We fit the J/\u03c8 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 Dalitz plot using the isobar model.
