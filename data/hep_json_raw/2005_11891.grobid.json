We observed no significant signals in 711 days of data. We obtain an upper limit for neutrino millicharge of 5.4\u00d710 \u221212 e at 90% confidence level assuming all three species of neutrino have common millicharge. We also set flavor-dependent limits assuming the respective neutrino flavor is the only one carrying a millicharge, 7.3\u00d710 \u221212 e for \u03bd e , 1.1\u00d710 \u221211 e for \u03bd \u00b5 , and 1.1\u00d710 \u221211 e for \u03bd \u03c4 . These limits are the most stringent yet obtained from direct measurements. We also obtain an upper limit for the neutrino magnetic moment of 1.8\u00d710 \u221210 Bohr magnetons. In addition, we obtain upper limits for the coupling constant of dark photons in the U(1) B\u2212L model of 1.3\u00d710 \u22126 if the dark photon mass is 1\u00d710 \u22123 MeV/c 2 , and 8.8\u00d710 \u22125 if it is 10 MeV/c 2 .",

Yet these detectors are also able to explore other physics topics due to their low backgrounds (BGs) and low energy threshold. A study using solar neutrinos was suggested in [5]. Solar neutrinos are generated by nuclear fusion in the Sun. The majority of solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton (pp) reaction, p + p \u2192 d + e + + \u03bd e in the pp-chain, which produces approximately 99% of the total solar energy. At Earth the flux of the pp solar neutrinos is 5.98\u00d710 10 cm \u22122 s \u22121 [6] and their spectrum is continuous with its endpoint at 422 keV. Another significant source of solar neutrinos is electron capture on 7 Be. The flux of 7 Be solar neutrinos at Earth is 5.00\u00d710 9 cm \u22122 s \u22121 [6] and their energy is monochromatic 862 keV. Here we search for interactions between these abundant low energy solar neutrinos and the electrons in the detector's LXe target that could be signatures of a neutrino electromagnetic millicharge, a neutrino magnetic moment, or interactions mediated by dark photons.",

For example, the lack of a charge asymmetry in the universe constrains the neutrino charge to be 4\u00d710 \u221235 e [10]. The most stringent upper limit from direct experimental searches is 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u221212 e [11]. The limit in [11] and the second most stringent one, 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u221212 e [12], were both obtained using reactor neutrinos, meaning electron antineutrinos, but also containing negligible amounts of other neutrino species such as\u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 . Thus these are antineutrino limits. The most stringent limit for neutrinos, on the other hand, was obtained by a vacuum birefringence experiment [13]. This limit is dependent on neutrino masses and < 3\u00d710 \u22128 e for neutrino masses of less than 10 meV. The limits from the reactor experiments do not have such a dependence on neutrino masses. This birefringence limit applies to all neutrino flavors. Solar neutrinos are produced as electron neutrinos, but due to neutrino oscillation at Earth they also contain \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 . In this paper we search for millicharge in all three neutrino flavors.",

It is not currently feasible to detect that small a neutrino magnetic moment experimentally. However, other extensions of SM theory yield neutrino magnetic moments at currently observable levels. For example, if the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the transition magnetic moment is estimated to be O(10 \u221212 \u223c 10 \u221210 )\u00b5 B in an extension that goes beyond a minimally-extended SM [15]. The Borexino experiment searched for a neutrino magnetic moment using 7 Be solar neutrinos. Borexino found no significant excess and set an upper limit of 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u221211 \u00b5 B [16].

The idea that the light vector boson of this hidden sector appears as a dark photon has been around for a long time [18,19], and the possibility that it appears at low energy has received wide interest. In the context of one such scenario, we search for a dark photon derived from a gauged U(1) B\u2212L symmetry, for which a noticeable increase of the cross section for electron-recoil from solar neutrino interactions is expected [20,21]. The mass M A \u2032 of the dark photon A \u2032 and coupling constant g B\u2212L are already constrained by various experimental and astrophysical analyses [21].

Data acquisition for the OD is triggered when eight or more of its PMTs register a signal within 200 ns. The ID is located at the center of the OD. An active target containing 832 kg of LXe is held in the copper structure of the ID. The ID's inner surface is \u223c40 cm away from the center and covered with 642 low-radioactivity PMTs (Hamamatsu R10789). Data-acquisition is triggered for the ID when four or more hits occur within 200 ns. Energy calibrations in the energy range between 1.2 keV and 2.6 MeV were conducted via the insertion of 55 Fe, 109 Cd, 241 Am, 57 Co, and 137 Cs sources along the vertical axis into the detector's sensitive volume, and by setting 60 Co and 232 Th sources outside the ID's vacuum vessel [23,24]. The time variation of the energy scale was traced via irradiation with 60 Co every week and by the insertion of 57 Co every other week.",

To account for atomic effects in xenon, which affect the signal expectation, we follow previous publications in using the free electron approximation (FEA) in our dark photon analysis. Effectively this approximation uses a series of step functions, one for every electron in the atom, each with the step at the respective electron's binding energy [26]. In our millicharge analysis on the other hand we follow [27] and use their results from their ab-initio multi-configuration relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) [28]. At 5 keV deposited energy the FEA cross section is about a factor of five less than the RRPA one. FEA was adopted for the dark photon analysis to be consistent with the magnetic moment analysis. In the magnetic moment analysis, we used FEA because RRPA calculations were only available below 20 keV. For this energy region, FEA predicts 5% less signal than the calculation based on RRPA. Thus the results of our neutrino magnetic moment and dark photon analyses based on FEA are conservative relative to what would be expected for RRPA. Figure 1 shows the deposited energy spectra of neutrino-electron interactions in xenon. The event rate due to dark photons is proportional to the forth power of g B\u2212L and the spectral shape depends upon M A \u2032 while the event rates due to a neutrino magnetic moment and to neutrino millicharge are proportional to the second power of these quantities. The expected signal spectrum results from the respective electron recoil spectrum in Figure 1 being folded with the detection efficiency of the detector, which is a function of energy:",

The MC takes into account the non-linearity of the scintillation response in LXe as well as corrections derived from the detector calibrations. The electron equivalent energy is calculated from photoelectron counts (PE), with the conversion factor from PE to electron equivalent energy determined by comparing calibration data to MC simulation. Energy resolution is taken into account based on calibration data. Gaussian smearing is applied to MC to reproduce the data [23]. The uncertainty of the scintillation efficiency coming from imperfect knowledge of the non-linearity of the scintillation response in LXe is included in the systematic uncertainty. The energy transferred in the interactions relevant to this paper ultimately becomes detectable as scintillation light emitted by electrons emerging from that interaction. As described in Section 2, radioactive sources were used to calibrate the detector response down to 1 keV. The uncertainty of this energy calibration is shown in Table 1 of [33]. For lower energies, it is \u00b14% at 1.65 keV and +7/\u22124% at 1 keV. We conservatively assume that the scintillation efficiency below 1 keV is zero since we have a large uncertainty [24].",

The R(Timing) selection is applied to suppress background events from the detector's inner surface. It was demonstrated that this selection is able to reduce events near the detector wall by a factor of ten around 5 keV as verified with the 241 Am calibration source. The position resolution of R(PE) is about 4 cm around R(PE) = 20 cm at 5 keV. The fiducial mass of natural xenon in that 20 cm volume is 97 kg. The analyzed energy range was then set to be 2-15 keV for the neutrino millicharge search and 2-200 keV for the neutrino magnetic moment and dark photon searches. The analyzed energy range 2-200 keV covers the expected signal after applying all reduction steps; it contains about 98% of the signal MC events for neutrino-magnetic-moment interactions, > 99% for dark photons of mass 1\u00d710 \u22123 MeV/c 2 , and about 92% for dark photons of mass 10 MeV/c 2 .",

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties in the signal were of two types. One came from the theoretical calculation of the signal. The uncertainty in the solar neutrino fluxes from the pp and 7 Be reactions are \u00b10.6% and \u00b17%, respectively [6]. Also of this type is the uncertainty in the atomic effects in neutrino-electron interactions in xenon, which is \u00b15% [27]. The other type of systematic uncertainty is related to the detector response. The most considerable systematic uncertainty in the signal is \u223c15% for the neutrino millicharge analysis, which came from the scintillation efficiency for electrons at low energy [24]. This is estimated by changing the scintillation efficiency parameters within the uncertainty obtained by calibration data with a 55 Fe source [24]. For energies > 30 keV, the uncertainty from the R(PE) cut, which corresponds to the uncertainty in fiducial mass, became dominant with \u223c 6%. This was estimated from the difference of reconstructed position between data and MC in the 241 Am and 57 Co source calibrations. The uncertainty in the scintillation-decay time for electron recoils and in optical properties of the LXe were estimated in the same way as in [4]. The uncertainty of signal strength due to the scintillation-decay time for electron recoils is \u223c 2 % for energies < 10 keV and less than 1 % for energies > 10 keV. The uncertainty of our signal estimates due to optical properties is \u223c 4 % for energies < 10 keV and less than 1 % for energies > 10 keV. Figure 2 shows the energy distribution of the BG simulation from 2 to 200 keV after event selection. The BG components in the fiducial volume were discussed in [4] for E recon < 30 keV and in [31] for E recon > 30 keV, respectively. The dominant BG component for E recon < 30 keV derives from the radioactive isotopes (RI) that existed at the inner surface of the detector. The RI we took into account are 238 U, 235 U, 232 Th, 40 K, 60 Co and 210 Pb in the detector-surface materials, which include RI in the PMTs and copper plate and ring used for the PMT support structure. Moreover, the 210 Pb accumulated on the inner surface of the detector is taken into account. RI induced surface events were often misidentified as events in the fiducial volume in the event reconstruction. All detector materials except for the LXe had been assayed using high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors or a surface-alpha counter [32]. The RI activities in the detector and their uncertainties were estimated by an analysis of alpha events and the energy spectrum without a fiducial volume cut. The dominant BG component for E recon >30 keV was from RI dissolved in the LXe. Such events were distributed uniformly in the LXe and could not be removed by a fiducial-volume cut. Two categories of RI were found to be dissolved in the LXe: One was impurities such as 222 Rn, 85 Kr, 39 Ar and 14 C. The 222 Rn and 85 Kr activities were estimated using event coincidence in the full volume of the ID. In [31], we identified 39 Ar and 14 C in the detector from gas analysis of xenon samples and by performing spectral fitting. The other category were mostly xenon isotopes: 136 Xe, which undergoes 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, and 125 I, 131m Xe and 133 Xe produced by neutron activation of common xenon isotopes. We estimated the concentration of 136 Xe from its natural abundance and that of 125 I from that of its precursor 124 Xe and the thermal-neutron flux at the Kamioka Observatory, respectively. The concentrations of 131m Xe and 133 Xe were estimated with a spectral fit performed in [31]. The peak from 131m Xe can be seen near 160 keV in Figure 2. We applied a data-driven correction to the simulated BG spectrum for E recon < 40 keV in order to take into account the systematic difference in the misreconstruction rate caused by dead PMTs as we did in [33]. The dead PMTs (9 out of 642 PMTs which had been found to be noisy or delivered strange responses) had been turned off. We evaluated the systematic difference of the probability with which events occurring close to the dead PMTs were reconstructed inside the fiducial volume. The difference between data and BG MC was found to be non-negligible below 40 keV. We applied a correction factor for the BG MC spectrum for such differences in each of the energy regions 2-5, 5-15, 15-20, 20-30 and 30-40 keV. These correction factors were estimated by comparing of the distance between the projection of the reconstructed vertex onto the detector surface and the dead-PMT position between data and BG MC in the fiducial volume. There are two systematic uncertainties associated with this correction factor. The first contribution was estimated by the difference in the correction factor estimated from the systematic difference of event rates in the fiducial volume by deliberately masking normal PMTs. The second contribution stems from the statistical uncertainty of the correction-factor estimate. The resultant correction and the systematic uncertainty of our BG model are shown in the inset of the bottom panel of Figure 2. These corrections amount to 0\u00b110%, 12\u00b114%, 14\u00b119%, 17\u00b128%, 46\u00b134% and 23\u00b120% in the energy regions 2-5, 5-15, 15-20, 20-30, and 30-40 keV, respectively. The systematic uncertainties in the BG MC were basically the same as those used in our previous WIMP-search analysis [4] for E recon < 30 keV except for the dead PMT contribution. The dominant uncertainties came from uncertainty about irregular aspects of the geometry of e.g. gaps between the PMT holder and PMT bodies, and the surface roughness and the optical reflectivity of the PMT support structures. For 30-200 keV, we re-evaluate the systematic errors for uncertainties in the performance of the reconstruction, the scintillation-decay time, and the optical parameters of the LXe. Again most significant systematic uncertainly in this energy range comes from the position reconstruction, and is \u223c6 % as discussed before. Its estimation method was the same as for the signal MC.",

The best fit \u03c7 2 is obtained at zero millicharge. Figure 3 shows the data and the best-fit signal + BG MC with the signal MC at the 90% CL upper limit. This limit is for neutrinos, not antineutrinos, and for neutrinos it is more stringent than the previous limit by more than three orders of magnitude [13]. Though the originally emitted solar neutrinos are \u03bd e , the neutrinos arriving at Earth consist of all three flavors, which are produced by neutrino oscillations: At Earth 54\u00b12% are \u03bd e , 23\u00b11% are \u03bd \u00b5 , and 23\u00b11% are \u03bd \u03c4 [22,34].

The 90% CL upper limit on the coupling constant as a function of the dark photon mass is shown in Figure 6, together with the limits and allowed region from other experimental and astrophysical analyses [21]. Like the other neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering experiments we exclude a wide area in this parameter space, and for neutrinos our limit on g B\u2212L is more stringent than Borexino's for M A \u2032 < 0.1 MeV/c 2 . While the exclusion areas derived in [21] from other experiments' publications already exclude an area larger than the one excluded by our analysis, our analysis is a dedicated one, incorporating our full knowledge of the detector response and our validated background models. Also most of the parameter space for the (g \u2212 2) dark photon prediction [21] was excluded by our analysis.",

            "text": "We conducted searches for exotic neutrino-electron interactions from solar neutrinos using 711 days of data in a 97 kg fiducial volume of the XMASS-I detector. We observed no significant signal. In the neutrino millicharge search, we set a neutrino millicharge upper limit of 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u221212 e at 90% CL assuming all three species of neutrino have common millicharge. This is comparable to limits from previous experiments using antineutrinos. It is however three orders of magnitude better than the best previous limit for neutrinos [13]. We set upper limits for individual flavors at 7.3 \u00d7 10 \u221212 e for \u03bd e , 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221211 e for \u03bd \u00b5 , and 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221211 e for \u03bd \u03c4 . Our upper limit for a neutrino magnetic moment is 1.8\u00d710 \u221210 \u00b5 B . Our result on dark photons in the U(1) B\u2212L model imposes severe new restrictions on the coupling constant with neutrino from M A \u2032 =1\u00d710 \u22123 to 1\u00d710 3 MeV/c 2 . In particular we almost exclude the area in which the U(1) B\u2212L model can solve the g \u2212 2 anomaly. Figure 6: 90% CL exclusion limits and allowed region on the coupling constant g B\u2212L as a function of the dark photon mass M A \u2032 . The black-solid line shows the exclusion limit of our analysis (XMASS). The 2\u03c3-allowed-region band from the muon (g\u22122) experiment is shown as \"(g \u2212 2) DP\" as the red-meshed region. The blue and magenta regions are excluded by laboratory experiments ((g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , (g \u2212 2) e , atomic phys., fixed target, B-factory [21] and NA48/2 [35]), respectively. The cyan and orange regions are excluded by cosmological and astrophysical constraints (Globular clusters, BBN [21]), respectively. BBN: the constraints of Big Bang nucleosynthesis on the mass of a light vector boson and its coupling constant to neutrinos in the B\u2212L scenario. In this case, Dirac neutrinos \u03bd R are assumed [36]. The range of region follows as [21]. The dotted lines are the estimated limit curves from neutrino-scattering experiments (GEMMA (\u03bd e ), Borexino (solar \u03bd), TEXONO-CsI (\u03bd e ) and CHARM II (\u03bd \u00b5 )) from [21].",
