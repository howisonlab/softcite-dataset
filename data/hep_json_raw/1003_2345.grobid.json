With the inclusion of long distance contributions the branching fractions can reach values of around 10 \u221213 [3]. The SM short distance Feynman diagrams for the D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay are shown in Fig. 1. The lepton-flavor violating (LFV) decays D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 are forbidden in the SM, but are possible in extensions of the SM with nondegenerate neutrinos and nonzero neutrino mixings and are expected to be of the order of 10 \u221214 [3] in these scenarios. All these predictions are orders of magnitude below the current experimental sensitivity.",

            "text": "In certain new physics (NP) scenarios, FCNC branching fractions can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude. For example, R-parity violating supersymmetry can increase the branching fractions of D 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 up to 10 \u221212 and 10 \u22128 , respectively [4]. The latter prediction is close to the current experimental sensitivity. As another example, so far unobserved leptoquarks were suggested as a possible explanation of the small discrepancy between the measured value of the D s meson decay constant and the prediction of lattice QCD [5]. Leptoquarks could also enhance the D 0 \u2192 + \u2212 branching fraction. In order to explain the measured D + s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd width by a leptoquark contribution, and comply with other constraints arising from charm meson decays, B D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 should be enhanced to 8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 [6]. The above examples demonstrate the importance of FCNC and LFV decays searches in the exploration of possible NP contributions. It should be noted that charm FCNC and LFV decays probe the couplings of the up-quark sector in contrast to B or K meson decays.",

Each charged track is required to have at least two associated vertex detector hits in each of the two measurement coordinates. To select pion and lepton candidates, we impose standard particle identification criteria. Charged pions are identified using dE/dx measurement from the CDC, Cherenkov light yields in the ACC, and timing information from the TOF [10]. Muon identification is based on the matching quality and penetration depth of associated hits in the KLM [11]. Electron identification is determined using the ratio of the energy deposit in the ECL to the momentum measured in the SVD and CDC, the shower shape in the ECL, the matching between the position of charged track trajectory and the cluster position in the ECL, the hit information from the ACC and the dE/dx information in the CDC [12].

The quantities \u2206M and \u2206q are measured relative to the nominal D 0 mass and nominal energy released in the D * + decay, respectively. The signal region in M is allowed to be asymmetric with respect to the nominal D 0 mass; for the \u00b5\u00b5 decay mode this provides some suppression of misidentified D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, since their invariant mass distribution peaks about 2 standard deviations below the D 0 mass; for the ee and e\u00b5 modes an asymmetric requirement accounts for the low mass tail due to electron bremsstrahlung. The requirement on the maximal allowed missing energy in the event is chosen to suppress background from semileptonic B decays; these events have larger missing energy due to undetected neutrinos. We found a broad maximum in F for the lepton identification probability, hence we repeated the procedure at fixed lepton identification criteria, optimizing only the size of the signal region and the maximal allowed missing energy in an event. The results are summarized in Table I. To estimate the number of combinatorial background events in the signal region, the sideband region |\u2206q| > 1 MeV is used. This region is chosen to reduce the statistical error and to exclude possible signal events and misidentification from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. The peaking background in the signal region due to misidentification of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays is estimated from the reconstructed D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays found in data by replacing the pion mass with the lepton mass and by weighting each event by",
