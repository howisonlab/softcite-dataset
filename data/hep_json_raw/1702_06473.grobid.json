The performance is studied using data collected during the first period of LHC operation (Run 1) and is compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The performance of the TRT, operating with two different gas mixtures (xenon-based and argon-based) and its dependence on the TRT occupancy is presented. These studies show that the tracking performance of the TRT is similar for the two gas mixtures and that a significant contribution to the particle momentum resolution is made by the TRT up to high particle densities.",

At the centre of the detector is an optimised, multi-technology tracking detector immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field produced by a solenoid. This central tracking detector, also called the inner detector (ID) [2], is designed to provide a high-precision reconstruction of charged-particle trajectories (\"tracks\"). The ID was successfully commissioned in 2008 [3], and since 2009 was operated with efficiency greater than 97% during the first period of the LHC operation (Run 1 in 2009-2013). The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and has full coverage in \u03c61 (see figure 1). It consists of a silicon pixel detector at the innermost radii (pixel), surrounded by a silicon microstrip Figure 1. The inner detector of the ATLAS experiment (during the first LHC data-taking period in 2009-2013) is viewed in the r-z plane, where r is the radial distance from the z-axis. The detector is symmetric with respect to the plane perpendicular to the beam line and passing through the collision point (0,0). Only the positive z side is shown.",

The positions of signals in individual detector elements (\"hits\") are used to reconstruct tracks inside the tracker. The track reconstruction algorithms employ local and global pattern recognition to identify a coherent pattern of hits corresponding to a track produced by a charged particle. An iterative track-fitting procedure is used to estimate the compatibility of the detector measurements with the track hypothesis and to compute the final track parameters [4]. These measurements correspond to the combination of neighbouring hits called \"clusters\" in the pixel and SCT detectors and to the distance of closest approach of the charged-particle track to each straw in the TRT. Figure 3 shows an event display illustrating reconstructed tracks in the ID with p T > 2 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4. A track from a particle traversing the ID volume with |\u03b7| < 2 would typically have 3 pixel clusters, 8 SCT strip clusters, and more than 30 TRT straw hits.",

The particle identification is based on TR, which arises when ultra-relativistic charged particles cross a boundary between media with different dielectric constants [5]. The probability of a given particle to emit transition radiation is determined solely by its Lorentz \u03b3-factor. In the X-ray energy range of the TR photons, this probability is a step-like function which rises from about zero to its maximum when the \u03b3-factor changes from about 500 to 2000. The TRT was built to exploit this effect, in particular to distinguish between electrons and pions up to momentum values of \u223c 100 GeV.",

The simulations used to describe the data are reported in section 2. A general description of the TRT, including a brief summary of the data acquisition system is given in section 3. Position coordinates of hits in the TRT are measured using drift-time information. The straw coordinate accuracy depends strongly on the calibration of the r-t relation, where r is the track position radius in the straw and t is the measured drift time. Section 4 describes the r-t calibration procedure. The track reconstruction accuracy substantially depends on precisely knowing the position of all TRT straw anode wires. A dedicated TRT alignment procedure was developed and the results of this procedure are presented in section 5. Results from studies of the TRT tracking parameters at low straw-occupancy are presented in section 6.1 for straw tubes filled with a xenon-based (Xe-based) gas mixture, which was the baseline operation during Run 1.

In most cases, the leaks are located in inaccessible areas and their repair is not possible. Because of the high cost of losing the Xe-based gas mixture, the possibility to operate the most affected modules with a significantly less expensive argon-based (Ar-based) gas mixture was investigated. In order to understand the TRT performance with such an Ar-based mixture, dedicated studies were performed during the proton-lead collisions in 2013 where leaking modules in the barrel and end-caps were supplied with the Ar-based mixture. The results of these studies are presented in section 6.2.

The TRT has two different geometrical arrangements of straws. The barrel section, where 52,544 straws are aligned parallel to the direction of the beam axis, covers the radial region 560 < r < 1080 mm and the longitudinal region |z| < 712 mm [14]. Two end-cap sections, each with 122,880 straws that are aligned perpendicular to the beam axis and point outwards in the radial direction, cover the regions 644 < r < 1004 mm and 827 < |z| < 2744 mm [15]. The TRT acceptance range is |\u03b7| < 2.0. The TRT barrel consists of 73 layers of straws organised in 3 cylindrical rings (green colour in figure 1), each containing 32 identical and independent modules. All the straws are embedded in stacks of polyproplylene or polyethylene fibres which produce transition radiation X-rays used for electron identification. The distance between straws is on average 6.8 mm in both the radial and azimuthal directions, and the length of the straws is 142.4 cm. In order to reduce the straw occupancy, the anode wires are separated electrically by glass wire joints at z = 0 so that each side is read out separately. The straws closest to the beam line have the largest occupancy. To further reduce occupancy, the wires in the innermost 9 of the 73 straw layers of the barrel are split into three parts, with only 34 cm of straw length being read out from each side, while the middle wire is not read out. These straws with shorter active region are referred to as short straws.",

The signal on each wire is then amplified, shaped, and discriminated against two adjustable thresholds [16]: low level (LL) and high level (HL). The LL threshold is used to measure an electron drift time for the tracking and is usually set to about 250-300 eV in absolute scale for the Xe-based gas mixture. The HL threshold is used to identify large energy deposits. The separation of particle types is based on the probability of a particle's signal in a straw to exceed the HL threshold, which is different for electrons which produce TR, and other particles with Lorentz factors below 1000 which do not produce TR. The HL threshold is optimised to obtain the best electron-pion separation and is set at about 6-7 keV for a Xe-based gas mixture.

This uncertainty is defined as the width \u03c3 of a Gaussian function fitted to the full range of the position residual distribution and thus is expected to be larger than the straw track position measurement accuracy. This uncertainty (referred to as the \"drift-circle error\") depends on the shortest distance between the anode wire and the particle crossing the straw. It is calibrated for both the data and Monte Carlo samples as a function of the drift time. An accurate determination of this uncertainty is necessary for track reconstruction [4], as it plays a role in the decision whether or not to include a given drift-radius measurement in the track-fitting procedure. Once a measurement is added to the track fitting, the uncertainty is also used to determine the weight of its contribution to the track fit. TRT hits with a track-to-wire distance within 2.5 times the drift-circle error (referred to as \"precision hits\") have the largest weight in the track fit. Figure 7 shows typical (during Run-1 conditions with 5 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 30) drift-circle errors as a function of the drift time for the barrel and end-cap regions of the TRT. A strong dependence of the drift-circle error on the drift time is seen, which can be divided in two regions. For t < 10 ns, which corresponds to the region very close to the wire (less than \u2248300 \u00b5m), the TRT measurements are assigned the anode wire coordinate during the track-fitting procedure. This procedure reduces the time jitter effect related to different arrival times of ionisation clusters at the anode wire as well as the effect of the left-right ambiguity (the ambiguity of the hit position being on the left or right side of the TRT straw centre) for the track-reconstruction procedure. As a result the drift-circle error decreases for this low drift-time interval. For tracks crossing the straw at distances larger than 300 \u00b5m from the wire (corresponding to drift times larger than \u224810 ns), the drift circles are accepted as track coordinates. This leads to an increase of the drift-circle error that rapidly drops with increasing drift radius, due to a reduction in the fluctuations of the first ionisation cluster arrival times (the clusters reach the wires at almost the same times, known as a \"focusing\" effect in wire chambers). The discrepancy between simulation and data is predominantly caused by differences in the tails of the residual distributions in data and simulation. Another effect contributing to the difference between simulation and data results from the approximations and models used to simulate the electrical behaviour of a straw tube as a transmission line. This effect is more pronounced for the barrel detector straws which are twice as long as the straws in the end-caps.",

The determination of the position of the active elements of the TRT is performed within the ATLAS alignment framework using a track-based technique which minimises the position residuals. The alignment of each ID detector is performed at several levels of granularity. Each structure has six basic degrees of freedom, corresponding to three translations along, and three rotations about, the x-, y-, and z-axes, whose origin and orientation depends on the alignment level. First, large structures such as the full barrel or the end-caps are aligned as individual units to correct for collective movements of the active elements (Level-1 alignment). Then, single sensitive devices are aligned (Level-2 and Levl-3 alignments). At Level 1, the alignment reference frame coincides with the ATLAS global coordinate frame (described in Footnote 1) and the TRT detector has the same granularity as the pixel and SCT detectors: one barrel component and two end-cap components.",

One can see a plateau at about 96% in straw efficiency for absolute values of track-to-wire distance below 1.5 mm, and a significant decrease in the region where the track passes close to the edge of the straw, due to the shorter track length in the straw. As mentioned earlier, the TRT LL threshold is set according to the TRT noise occupancy requirements and its absolute value in terms of energy scale is not a priori exactly known. Consequently, the LL threshold setting in the simulation was tuned to obtain agreement with the data for the plateau region of the straw efficiency distributions, separately for the barrel and end-caps. Agreement is best when the effective LL threshold is set to about 280 eV for the TRT barrel and to about 250 eV for the end-caps. Figure 10 shows the maximum straw efficiency as a function of the track \u03b7. In this figure, the maximum straw efficiency is extracted from a constant fit to the plateau of the straw efficiency vs track-to-wire distance for each bin of \u03b7. The maximum straw efficiency is found to be 96% on average. The few percent variations around this value are related to the variation of the particle incident angle relative to the straw and to the change of the signal amplitude along the wire. The straw efficiency is smaller for particle crossing the straws close to the barrel edge (in the barrel to end-cap transition region) because the number of straws crossed by particles in this region is smaller and because this is where the services for the SCT and TRT stands, along with the TRT barrel electronics. This leads to some reduction of the track reconstruction accuracy and hence decrease of the straws efficiency.  TRT, while for the barrel the simulation predicts a smaller position accuracy than observed in the data (up to about 10 \u00b5m). As described in section 4 for figure 7, this different degree of agreement between data and simulation in the barrel and the end-cap regions results from approximations and models used to simulate the electrical behavior of a straw tube as a transmission line. For the barrel detector, straws are twice as long as the straws in the end-caps. As already observed for the straw efficiency, there is a variation of the straw track position measurement accuracy around the central value of \u223c110 \u00b5m for the same reasons as mentioned earlier. In particular, the change of the signal amplitude along the wire has a significant effect for the long straws in the barrel. Although low-occupancy LHC fills were chosen for these studies (5 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 30) there is still some dependence of the straw track position measurement accuracy on occupancy. Figure 12 shows the averaged straw track position measurement accuracy as a function of \u00b5 for the TRT barrel and end-caps, comparing data with simulation. As seen in figure 11, the simulation underestimates the straw track position measurement accuracy in the barrel straws by about 6 \u00b5m on average, but the general trend as a function of \u00b5 is well reproduced. For the end-caps the simulation is in agreement with data. In the data, the average straw track position measurement accuracy over the entire TRT is in the range 105 \u00b5m-115 \u00b5m.",

            "text": "An Ar-based gas mixture was considered as an alternative to the Xe-based gas mixture for the TRT operation at the detector design stage. While it is not appropriate for electron identification due to its inability to absorb TR efficiently, it is expected to be fully adequate for tracking purposes. A special option for signals from an Ar-based gas mixture in the front-end signal-shaping electronics was foreseen in the TRT read-out design [16]. Because of the specific signal shape from the straw for an Ar-based mixture, the TRT read-out electronics integrates more charge during the signal processing than for a Xe-based mixture (about 15% instead of 5%) and hence can operate at a lower effective threshold. A lower threshold should result in an improvement of the drift-time measurement -14 -   accuracy. On the other hand, the Ar-based mixture has less density than the corresponding Xebased one, leading to an increase in the average distance between ionisation clusters and hence to a degradation of the drift-time measurement accuracy. In order to test the performance of an Ar-based mixture, and to be able to tune the simulation, a gas mixture of 70% Ar, 27% CO 2 , and 3% O 2 was used to fill the straws in some parts of the TRT (four modules in the first layer of the barrel and the end-cap wheels number 7 and 8 on the negative \u03b7 side, see figure 1) during the proton-lead collision data-taking period in 2013. Different runs with various high-voltage settings were taken for the Ar-filled straws. In order to compare data with simulation, a LL threshold scan in the simulation was performed to match the different high-voltage settings in data.   Figure 14. Position residual distribution for the Ar-based end-cap straws for data and simulation using the 100 eV threshold setting. Figure 13 shows the straw efficiency for an Ar-based mixture in the end-cap wheels as a function of the track-to-wire distance. This figure shows the same behaviour as seen previously for the Xe-based gas mixture (see section 6.1), with a plateau close to 100% efficiency and agreement between simulation and data. The higher plateau found here reflects the fact that for argon, the effective threshold is about a factor of three lower than that for xenon, thus increasing the sensitivity of the read-out electronics to low ionisation-energy clusters. Figure 14 depicts an example of the track position residual distribution for the Ar-filled straws in end-cap, for data and simulation, and for a LL threshold setting of about 100 eV. The simulation predicts better accuracy than that observed in data. This points to a small mismodelling of some parameters for the Ar-based mixture. The maximum straw efficiency and straw track position measurement accuracy as a function of different LL threshold settings are shown in figures 15 and 16 for the barrel and the end-caps. The straw efficiency shows little sensitivity to the LL threshold in the tested range whilst the dependence is more significant for the straw track position measurement accuracy. There is good agreement between simulation and data for the straw efficiency, while the straw track position accuracy is found to be about 10-15% worse in data. The straw track position accuracy is below 125 \u00b5m for all thresholds and over the entire TRT.  Figure 17.

With the 50 ns spacing, the occupancy in pp collisions reached in the TRT was at the level of \u223c25%, and approached the 90% level in heavy ion collisions. During the Run-2 period, started in 2015, the LHC operates with the design 25 ns bunch spacing and provides higher instantaneous luminosity. In these conditions the TRT straw occupancy significantly increases not only due to the increased luminosity but also due to the contribution from additional collisions in neighbouring bunches (out-of-time pile-up), which become more probable with the reduced bunch spacing. The TRT is designed to operate in a high occupancy environment thanks to the large number of measurements (30) provided by the TRT along reconstructed tracks. Even at very high occupancy there are always some precision hits which significantly contribute to the track-finding algorithm and to the particle momentum reconstruction accuracy. High-occupancy conditions are studied to understand the effect of large charged-particle densities on the TRT performance. The studies were carried out using a special high-\u00b5 LHC fill during a pp data-taking period in 2012, and using data from heavy ion collisions taken in 2011. Figure 17 shows the correlation between the TRT occupancy and \u00b5 for the high-\u00b5 LHC fill. The simulation well describes the linear dependence of the TRT occupancy on the pile-up. The average TRT occupancy for \u00b5 = 70 is about 35% in these pp collisions and can even reach a level of 50% in some events due to the large fluctuation of the number of primary collisions.",

            "text": "In this section, two TRT tracking parameters (TRT track extension fraction and precision hit fraction) are studied using particle tracks with p T in the 0.5-100 GeV range. The precision hit fraction is defined as the number of precision TRT hits (defined in section 4) divided by the total number of hits on the selected track. In the standard ATLAS track-finding algorithm, tracks are first found in the silicon trackers (pixel and SCT) and then TRT hits are added to extend the number of measurements on the reconstructed track. If for some reason (for instance because of hard interactions of particles with the detector material) TRT hits are not found by the algorithm, then the track parameters are calculated using only the information from silicon detectors. The TRT track extension fraction is the fraction of tracks reconstructed in the pixel and SCT detectors with their corresponding efficiencies [20], which also have a continuation (extension) in the TRT. In these studies, at least 18 TRT hits are required to be on such tracks. The TRT track extension fraction reflects how efficiently the information from the TRT is used in the standard ATLAS trackfinding algorithm. For an extension to be accepted, several criteria have to be fulfilled, related to the minimum number of TRT hits, the fraction of precision hits on this extension, or the overall goodness of the fit after inclusion of the TRT segment. Figure 18 shows a comparison of data and simulation for pp collisions for both the track extension fraction and precision hit fraction. The track extension fraction is almost constant for occupancies up to 50%. It happens that some tracks have a significant deviation from their ideal trajectory due to interactions with ID material. After these tracks are fitted, a lot of the TRT hits are lost because the real trajectory is not known well enough. These tracks generally fail to have the -  required minimum number of TRT hits on the extension. With increasing occupancy, additional hits are collected in the TRT track which are not from the particle of interest (background hits) but this causes the requirement to be fulfilled more frequently. This is why a small rise (2%) of the TRT extension fraction is observed in this figure.",

This happens because the probability for a background track to cross the straw closer to the wire than the particle of interest increases and causes the leading edge to be earlier than the real one. However, these background hits give wrong drift circle measurements and thus cannot be considered as precision hits. The consequence is that the total number of precision hits on the track decreases with increasing occupancy, which leads to a reduction of the extension fraction due to the requirement on this quantity mentioned above. The two effects compensate for each other, producing a plateau in the extension fraction distribution. The decrease of the TRT precision hit fraction can be seen directly in the right panel of figure 18. However, even for a detector with about 50% straw occupancy, more than 75% of the track hits correspond to precision hits. The simulation describes the data well.",
