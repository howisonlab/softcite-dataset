One of the important implications of this symmetry law is the requirement that in all processes involving particles and their antiparticles the corresponding probabilities and other parameters governing the process should be exactly the same. Many experiments based on that principle have been conducted to probe the CPT conservation. For instance, in the leptonic sector, a measurement of g-factor for electron and positron performed at the University of Washington in Seattle [4] or, in the baryonic sector, a mass measurement of proton and antiproton implemented at CERN [5,6].",

If observed, the pattern would also give a hint of the number of sterile neutrino flavors. The simplest assumption is the scenario with one additional sterile flavor, so-called 3 +1 scheme [12]. The current global fit to the oscillation data suggests that the additional mass-squared difference and mixing angle governing the active-to-sterile conversion should be of the order of m 2 41 \u223c 1 eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 ee \u223c 0.1 respectively [13]. Assuming these parameter values and relying on the proportionality between the energy and oscillation length, we may choose the energy of neutrinos in a way that at least one full oscillation period will overlap with the active volume of a single detector, like it is proposed in the Borexino SOX experiment [14]. The realization of this neutrino oscillometry method [15] will open a unique opportunity to search not only for disappearance oscillations to sterile neutrinos but also to check the validity of CPT conservation in the leptonic sector if such a transition is observed.",

The source of \u03bd e or \u03bd e would be located close to the top of the detector, as it is shown in Fig. 3B. In this case only the hemispherical volume near the top would be considered for analysis. This is clearly a less favorable geometry as it uses only part of the fiducial volume and has to cope with non-optimal coverage by the photo sensors (PMTs). The only considerable advantage of this geometry is that it eliminates the need to immerse the source into the volume of the detector. For the purpose of this analysis the two detector geometries differ just by a factor of 4 (volume of a sphere vs. hemisphere) hence energyand distance-dependent event rate in both cases can be expressed by the equation [21,29]:  where A 0 is the source activity at the start of the measurement, n the density of free protons (electrons) in the target, the width of bin with the center L, \u03c3 (E) the cross section for IBD or electron-neutrino scattering, S(E) the spectral shape (delta-function for monoenergetic neutrinos), P (L, E) the oscillation probability (1), t e the time of measurement and \u03bb the decay constant of the source. The total exposure time needed to complete the measurement would be about 355 days assuming that both sources are used subsequently. The event rates were plotted as a function of the distance from the source and are shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B for \u03bd e and \u03bd e respectively.

In the case of JUNO the energy resolution of 3%/ \u221a E [MeV] and position resolution of 9 cm (\u03bd e ) and 4.5 cm (\u03bd e ) were used. For LENA 6.1%/ \u221a E [MeV], 10 cm (\u03bd e ) and 4.5 cm (\u03bd e ) were used respectively.   Neglecting background from radioactive decays, the main background in the energy region of interest for \u03bd e detection arises from the solar neutrinos ( 7 Be). It is shown in Table 2. The influence of this factor on the final result was also taken into account in our estimations. Nevertheless, direct measurements of the solar background are carried out automatically whenever the sources are removed so the correction may be done afterwards. In the case of antineutrinos, the highest background comes from nuclear reactors and can be neglected, even in the case of JUNO detector, because the expected neutrino flux from 144 Ce-144 Pr source located in the middle of the detector is considerably higher than that of 12 power reactors 53 km away. The estimated event rates from sources with the strength of 8 MCi for 51 Cr and 0.12 MCi for 144 Ce-144 Pr as well as the corresponding backgrounds are presented in Table 2. The main outcome of our simulations is shown in Fig. 7 (for LENA) and Fig. 8 (for JUNO). The figures show a 5\u03c3 sensitivity limit calculated for 3 different sin 2 2\u03b8 ee values and plotted as a function of m 2 41 . For instance, if we check the performance for the parameters chosen by the global fit that is m 2 41 \u2265 1 eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 ee \u2248 0.1, we conclude from Fig. 7 that LENA will detect (at the 5\u03c3 level of measured events) a difference of m 2 41 neutrino/antineutrino and therefore CPT violation that exceeds 1%. For the same parameters JUNO would reach 0.5% sensitivity as it may be observed from Fig. 8. The slightly better sensitivity of the JUNO detector is a consequence of the spherical shape and better expected energy resolution.",

If the \"sterile\" oscillation patterns are detected, the experiment will yield new fundamentally important oscillation parameters and will be sensitive to the mass inequality on the level of a few tenths of a percent at 5\u03c3 significance. This sensitivity can be achieved assuming the current best-fit values of the oscillation parameters indicated by the global fit.",
