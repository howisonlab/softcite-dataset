            "text": "In R-parity-conserving SUSY models [11], the supersymmetric partners are produced in pairs. Top squarks are produced by strong interactions through quark-antiquark (qq) annihilation or gluon-gluon fusion, and the cross section of direct top-squark pair production is largely decoupled from the specific choice of SUSY model parameters [12][13][14][15]. The decay of the top squark depends on the mixing of the superpartners of left-and righthanded top quarks, the masses of the top superpartner, and the mixing parameters of the fermionic partners of the electroweak and Higgs bosons. The mass eigenstates of the partners of electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons (binos, winos, higgsinos) are collectively known as charginos,\u03c7 \u00b1 i , i = 1, 2, and neutralinos,\u03c7 0 i , i = 1, . . . , 4, where\u03c7 to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) which is stable and a dark-matter candidate [16,17]. For the models considered, either\u03c7 0 2 or\u03c7 \u00b1 1 is assumed to be the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Three different decay scenarios are considered in this search: (a) both top squarks decay viat 1 \u2192 t ( * )\u03c7 0 1 , (b) at least one of the top squarks decays viat 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 , where h is the SM-like Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, as illustrated in figure 1(a)\u2212(c), respectively. The interpretation of the results uses simplified models [18][19][20] where only one or two decay steps are allowed. In the case with two allowed decays, referred to later in this paper as a natural SUSY-inspired mixed grid, the mass splitting between the\u03c7 ), is assumed to be 1 GeV. A grid of signal samples is generated across the plane of the top-squark and\u03c7 0 1 masses with a grid spacing of 50 GeV across most of the plane, assuming maximal mixing between the partners of the left-and right-handed top quarks. In both the one-and two-step decay scenarios the LSP is considered to be a pure bino state. Additionally, results are interpreted in two slices of phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [21,22] models, referred to as wino-NLSP and well-tempered neutralino pMSSM models in the remainder of this paper. The pMSSM models are based on the more general MSSM [23,24] but with the additional requirements of no new sources of CP violation and flavour-changing neutral currents, as well as first-and second-generation sfermion mass and trilinear coupling degeneracy. Finally, results are also interpreted in a simplified model which is inspired by the pMSSM and is referred to as non-asymptotic higgsino. Details of the models that are used in the various interpretations are given in section 9.",

This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz for offline storage. In all search regions, a missing transverse momentum trigger, which is fully efficient for offline calibrated E miss T > 250 GeV in signal events, was used to collect data events. Data samples enriched in the major sources of background were collected with electron or muon triggers. The electron trigger selects events based on the presence of clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter, with a shower shape consistent with that expected for an electron, and a matching track in the tracking system. The muon trigger selects events containing one or more muon candidates based on tracks identified in the muon spectrometer and inner detector.

The fast simulation was validated against full GEANT4 simulation for several selected signal samples and subsequently used for all signal samples because of the large number of signal grid points needed for interpretation. All SM background samples used the GEANT4 set-up. All MC samples were produced with a varying number of simulated minimum-bias interactions overlaid on the hard-scattering event to account for multiple pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossing (pile-up). These events were produced using PYTHIA8 with the A2 tune [61] and MSTW 2008 PDF set [62]. The simulated events were reweighted to match the distribution of the number of pp interactions per bunch crossing in data. Corrections were applied to the simulated events to correct for differences between data and simulation for the lepton-trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, momentum scale, energy resolution, isolation, and for the efficiency of identifying jets containing b-hadrons, together with the probability for mis-tagging jets containing only light-flavour and charm hadrons.",

The signal contamination is below 8% in all CRs for all signal points that have not been excluded by previous ATLAS searches. No significant difference in the background estimates was found between the case where only SM backgrounds were considered and when signal is included in the estimation. As the CRs are not 100% pure in the process of interest, the cross-contamination between CRs from other processes is estimated. The normalization factors and the cross-contamination are determined simultaneously for all regions using a fit described below.",

Finally, the normalization of the tt+W /Z background in the signal region, which is completely dominated by tt + Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd), is estimated with a tt + \u03b3 control region in a way similar to the method described in ref.

Additionally, the presence of an isolated photon with p T > 150 GeV is required and it is used to model the Z decay in the signal regions because of the similarity between the diagrams for photon and Z production.

The largest impact of the tt theory systematic uncertainties on the total background yields arises for SRC and it varies from 11% to 71% by tightening the R ISR requirement.

Finally, the uncertainty in the estimated number of signal events which arises from the cross-section uncertainties for the various processes is taken into account by calculating two additional limits considering a \u00b11\u03c3 change in cross section. The cross-section uncertainty is \u223c15-20% for direct topsquark production and \u223c15-30% for gluino production [12][13][14][15] depending on the top-squark and gluino masses.",

The total background estimate is determined from a simultaneous fit to all control regions, based on a procedure described in section 7 but including the corresponding signal regions as well as control regions. Figure 7 shows the distribution of E miss T , m \u03c7 2 T2 , m b,max T , m T , R ISR , and H T for the various signal regions, with R ISR being shown combining SRC1-5. In these distributions, the background predictions are scaled to the values determined from the simultaneous fit. No significant excess above the SM prediction is observed in any of the signal regions. The smallest p-values, which express the probability that the background fluctuates to the data or above, are 27%, 27%, and 29% for SRB-T0, SRD-high, and SRA-TT, respectively. The largest deficit in the data can be found in SRC4 where one event is observed while 7.7 background events were expected. The 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the number of beyond-the-SM (BSM) events in each signal region are derived using the CL s prescription [87,88] and calculated from asymptotic formulae [84]. Model-independent limits on the visible BSM cross sections, defined as \u03c3 vis = S 95 obs / L dt, where S 95 obs is the 95% CL upper limit on the number of signal events, are reported in table 14.",

The profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic is used to set limits on direct pair production of top squarks. The signal strength parameter is allowed to float in the fit [85], and any signal contamination in the CRs is taken into account. Again, limits are derived using the CL s prescription and calculated from asymptotic formulae. Orthogonal signal subregions, such as SRA-TT, SRA-TW, and SRA-T0, are statistically combined by multiplying their likelihood functions. A similar procedure is performed for the signal subregions in SRB and SRC. For the overlapping signal regions defined for SRD (SRD-low and SRD-high), the signal region with the smallest expected CL s value is chosen for each signal model. Once the signal subregions are combined or chosen, the signal region with the smallest expected CL s is chosen for each signal model in thet 1 -\u03c7 0 1 signal grid.

The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 . The transverse momentum is the momentum component in the transverse plane.",

For SRC, the same requirements are used when defining the validation region (VRTC) except for the looser requirements of m S > 100 GeV, p 4,S T > 40 GeV and N S jet > 4. The \u2206\u03c6(ISR, p miss T ) requirement is inverted and m V /m S < 0.6, where m V is the transverse mass defined by the visible objects of the sparticle system and the E miss T , is applied in addition to the existing selection. The validation region to validate the background estimates in SRD (VRTD) is formed by applying the following requirements: 100 < m b,minT < 200 GeV, p 0,b T + p 1,b T > 300 GeV, p 3 T > 80GeV, and m b,max T > 300 GeV. All other requirements are applied exactly as in SRD-low except for the requirement on p 4 T which is dropped. Finally, the validation region defined for SRE (VRTE) applies only the same requirements on the number of b-jets, m 0 jet,R=0.8 , and m 1 jet,R=0.8 , and inverts the m b,min T requirement to 100 < m b,min T < 200 GeV. No other requirement is applied to VRTE.A one-lepton validation region for the W + jets background (VRW) is used to test the W background estimates in all SRs. In this case the validation region is designed based on the definition of CRW. Compared to CRW, the requirement that differs is \u2206R(b 0,1 , ) min , which is greater than 1.8 for the validation region. Two additional requirements are included in the definition of VRW, namely m b,min T > 150 GeV and m 0 jet,R=1.2 < 70 GeV.",
