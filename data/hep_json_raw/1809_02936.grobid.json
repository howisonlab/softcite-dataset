In particular, the weighted Sivers asymmetries provide direct information on the Sivers function, which is a leading-twist distribution that arises from a correlation between the transverse momentum of an unpolarised quark in a transversely polarised nucleon and the spin of the nucleon. Using the high-statistics data collected by the COMPASS Collaboration in 2010 with a transversely polarised proton target, we have evaluated two types of P T -weighted Sivers asymmetries, which are both proportional to the product of the first transverse moment of the Sivers function and of the fragmentation function. The results are compared to the standard unweighted Sivers asymmetries and used to extract the first transverse moments of the Sivers distributions for u and d quarks.",

            "text": "The traditional description of the nucleon structure in hard inclusive processes in terms of collinear parton distribution functions, which depend on the parton light-cone momentum fraction x and on a characteristic hard scale Q 2 , was recently generalised to take into account the transverse momentum k T of the parton with respect to the nucleon direction (for reviews, see [1][2][3]). A complete picture of the nucleon at leading twist requires a total of eight transversemomentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). They provide important information on the dynamics of the partons in the transverse plane in momentum space. Upon integration over the transverse momentum, three of them reduce to the number density, the helicity and the transversity collinear distributions. The other five TMDs contain prefactors that are sensitive to the direction of the quark transverse momentum vector k T , and their contribution to the hadronic tensor vanishes when integrating over k T .",

In semi-inclusive measurements of deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) off a transversely polarised nucleon, the Sivers TMD embodies in the cross section a sine modulation on the difference between the azimuthal angle \u03c6 h of the produced hadron and that of the target nucleon spin, \u03c6 S . The Sivers effect was experimentally observed in SIDIS using transversely polarised proton targets, first by the HERMES Collaboration [8,9] and then, at higher energy, by the COMPASS Collaboration [10,11]. The COMPASS measurements on the deuteron [12,13] showed asymmetries compatible with zero within the experimental accuracy. More recently, data on pion production off a transversely polarised 3 He target were made available by the Hall A Collaboration at JLab [14]. Combined analyses of these measurements [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] allowed for extractions of the Sivers functions and of their first transverse moments f",

The 1.2 m long NH 3 target was kept at 50 mK in a dilution refrigerator cryostat and segmented in three cells, 30 cm, 60 cm and 30 cm long respectively. The proton polarisation of about 80% was oriented vertically by a 0.63 T magnetic field that was provided by the saddle coils of the polarised target magnet [37]. The data were taken at a mean beam intensity of 3.5 \u00d7 10 8 \u03bc/spill, for a spill length of about 10 s every 40 s. About 37 \u00d7 10 9 events, corresponding to 1.9 PB of data, were collected in twelve separate periods. In order to minimize systematic errors, during each period of data taking the orientation of the proton polarisation in the three target cells was either up-down-up or down-up-down in the first subperiod, and reversed in the second one.

[26], where the pion Sivers asymmetries from the COMPASS proton [38] and deuteron [43] data are used as input. The data set used in Ref. [26] and the present one have the dominating pion data on the proton target in common, so that the results are strongly correlated. As can be seen in Fig. 12, in the present work the uncertainties on the extracted u v and d v Sivers function moments are on average smaller by a factor of about 1.5 with respect to the corresponding quantities in Ref. [26]. This is due to the fact that we assumed the Sivers function of the sea quarks to be zero, and no quantitative uncertainty was attributed to this assumption. Following the method of Ref. [26] and imposing the sea-quark Sivers functions to be zero, we have determined the u v and d v functions from the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 proton asymmetries [38] only and verified that both the central values and the uncertainties are very similar to the ones presented in this paper. Thus the differences visible in Fig. 12 can be attributed to the impact of the deuteron data and to the extraction of the sea-quark Sivers function, rather then to the use of unweighted asymmetries.",

These new observables provide the direct access to the first moment of the Sivers function avoiding the transverse-momentum convolution of the TMD Sivers and fragmentation functions, which enter in the standard Sivers asymmetry. The weighted asymmetries were determined for positive and negative hadrons using as weight either P T /zM or P T /M. In both cases, the asymmetries were found to be positive for positive hadrons in the range x > 0.013 and compatible with zero for negative hadrons with z > 0.2, very much as in the case of the standard Sivers asymmetries. The z dependence for positive hadrons agrees with the expectation in the case of u-quark dominance and of a measurement performed in the current-fragmentation region.",

In the leading-order pQCD formalism, the obtained values are model independent because of the use of weighted asymmetries and because of the point-by-point extraction. Extractions of the first moments of the Sivers functions, which are based on the Gaussian ansatz and use the standard proton Sivers asymmetries, compare well with our results.",

As in all other extractions of the Sivers functions from SIDIS asymmetries on transversely polarised nucleons, the d-quark Sivers function turns out to be poorly determined and strongly dependent on the assumptions on the Sivers functions of the sea quarks. This is due to the scarcity of Sivers asymmetry data taken with a transversely polarised deuteron target, as compared to the existing data taken with a transversely polarised proton target. The recently approved COMPASS run [44] with a transversely polarised deuteron target in 2021 is expected to allow for a much better extraction of the Sivers functions for both quarks and antiquarks.",
