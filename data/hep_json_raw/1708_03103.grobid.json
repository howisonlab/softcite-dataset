In previous experiments, only about 10% of the expected J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) radiative decays have been observed exclusively [8]. Within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), radiative decays of the vector charmonium states proceed predominantly via the emission of a real photon from the c orc quark, followed by the cc annihilation into two gluons.",

            "text": "Various phenomenological mechanisms, such as \u03b7 c -\u03b7 (\u2032) mixing [2,3], final-state radiation by light quarks [4,5], and the vector-meson dominance model in association with \u03b7 c\u03b7 (\u2032) mixing [6], are proposed to explain the properties of charmonium state radiative decays to a pseudoscalar meson. Measurements of these charmonium radiative decays provide important tests for the different theoretical predictions. The ratio R J/\u03c8 \u2261 B(J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b3\u03b7) B(J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) has been predicted based on the first-order perturbative QCD calculation, and R \u03c8(3686) \u2261 B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03b7) B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 ) is expected to be approximately the same; i.e. R \u03c8(3686) \u2248 R J/\u03c8 [7]. The decay rates of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 are expected to be smaller than those of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 or \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 as a consequence of suppressed gluon coupling to isovector currents. By assuming that the partial widths of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 are saturated by the \u03b7 c\u03b7 \u2032 mixing, the predicted branching fractions of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 were accounted for to the correct orders of magnitude in Ref. [9]. The CLEO experiment [10] measured the branching fractions of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) decays to \u03b3\u03c0 0 , \u03b3\u03b7, and \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 using a data sample of 27 \u00d7 10 6 \u03c8(3686) events, and found a value of R J/\u03c8 = (21.1 \u00b1 0.9)% and R \u03c8(3686) < 1.8% and so R \u03c8(3686) \u226a R J/\u03c8 . The most recent experimental results from the BESIII Collaboration [11] confirmed the small value of R \u03c8(3686) and made a first measurement of the branching fraction B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) of (1.58 \u00b1 0.4(stat.) \u00b1 0.13(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22126 based on a data sample of 106 \u00d7 10 6 \u03c8(3686) events. These results suggest a deviation from the saturation assumption [9] and imply that some other mechanisms are important in \u03c8(3686) radiative decays to a pseudoscalar meson (P). Reference [6] discusses decay mechanisms in the framework of the vector-meson dominance model associated with \u03b7 c -\u03b7 (\u2032) mixing in order to interpret the difference between J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) radiative decays to a pseudoscalar meson and predicts B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) = (0.07 \u223c 0.12) \u00d7 10 \u22126 . Reference [12] predicts B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) \u2248 2.19 \u00d7 10 \u22127 in the framework of the vector-meson dominance model. Another model, named survival hypothesis [13], predicts 0.8 < B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03b7) < 1.2.",

No event within the \u03b7 \u2032 signal region passes the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 selection criteria. Therefore the background from non-resonant production is negligible. For the charged decay mode \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, we use the events in the \u03b7 sideband region, [M \u03b7 \u22129\u03c3, M \u03b7 \u22126\u03c3] and [M \u03b7 +6\u03c3, M \u03b7 +9\u03c3], to check the contribution of non-\u03b7 backgrounds. The investigation shows that this kind of background distributes uniformly in the region of interest in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 invariant mass spectrum. A study of the inclusive \u03c8(3686) MC sample reveals that the channels \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 with J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are the dominant backgrounds with an \u03b7 in the final state.

The contribution from \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is negligible because of the small branching fraction.

One of the photons converts into an e + e \u2212 pair, which are misidentified as two photons if the track finding algorithm fails. To remove this kind of background, we require fewer than eight hits in the MDC in the region between the two radial lines connecting the IP and the two shower positions in the EMC. According to MC studies, almost all of peaking background caused by the gamma conversion process in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events can be rejected with only a 2.7% loss in the signal efficiency. The other backgrounds are the decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 2), with \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , which produce a peak in the signal region in the two-photon invariant mass. According to MC simulations and using the well-measured branching fractions quoted in the PDG [8], the background is expected to be 36.7 \u00b1 1.7 events.   Figure 3 shows the M (\u03b3\u03b3) spectrum for selected \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 candidates. A clear peak from the \u03c0 0 signal is observed. An unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the M (\u03b3\u03b3) distribution is performed to detemine the signal yield. The fit function consists of three components representing the signal, a smooth background from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3 ISR ) events, and a contribution from \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ decays with \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The signal is modeled by a MC simulated shape convoluted with a Gaussian function representing the resolution difference between the MC simulation and the data. The parameters of the Gaussian function are left free in the fit. The shape parameters of the smooth background are determined from the MC simulation and the magnitude is determined by the fit to data.

The statistical significance of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03b3\u03c0 0 are 7.3\u03c3 and 6.7\u03c3, respectively, and the decay branching fractions are measured with much improved precision, superseding the previous BESIII measurement [11]. A comparison of these results to those in Ref. [11] is shown in Table I. The branching fraction of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 is very close to the previous result but with greater precision, while those of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03b3\u03c0 0 are lower than the previous results, but consistent with them.",

            "text": "The ratio of branching fractions for \u03c8(3686) radiative decays to \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 is calculated to be R \u03c8(3686) = (0.66 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.02)%. This is about 30 times smaller than the corresponding ratio from J/\u03c8 radiative decays, R J/\u03c8 = (21.4 \u00b1 0.9)%. The large difference in the ratios of branching fractions between J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) radiative decays can be explained by the approach proposed in Ref. [6]. The measured ratio of branching fractions B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03b3\u03b7) = 1.11 \u00b1 0.30 agrees with the predictions in Ref [13]. However, the predicted branching fraction of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 in Ref. [6], B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 ) = (0.66 \u223c 1.15) \u00d7 10 \u22127 , is one order smaller than that in this measurement. Further investigations are necessary to understand the discrepancy. The results presented in this paper provide an ideal benchmark for testing various theoretical models of radiative decays of cc bound states. TABLE II.
