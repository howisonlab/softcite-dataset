The features of the neutrino mass hierarchy can be extracted from the |\u2206m 2 31 | and |\u2206m 2 32 | oscillations by applying the Fourier sine and cosine transform to the L/E spectrum. To determine the neutrino mass hierarchy above 90% probability, the requirements on the energy resolution as a function of the baseline are studied at sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.1. If the energy resolution of the neutrino detector is less than 0.04/ \u221a E \u03bd and the determination probability obtained from Bayes' theorem is above 90%, the detector needs to be located around 48-53 km from the reactor(s) to measure the energy spectrum of\u03bd e . These results will be helpful for setting up an experiment to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, which is an important problem in neutrino physics.",

[4][5][6][7][8], and the Fourier-transform methods [5,9,10]. The \u03c7 2 analysis methods based on the newly adopted Bayesian approach utilizes all the available information from experiments, and it is straightforward to incorporate the uncertainties in order to evaluate the sensitivity, providing robust and complementary results in the Fourier-transform methods [11]. Although the \u03c7 2 analysis methods are attractive and interesting, the Fourier-transform methods are more intuitive. The prominent merit of the Fourier-transform methods are that the mass hierarchy can be extracted without precise knowledge of the reactor antineutrino spectrum, the absolute value of the large |\u2206m 2 31 |, and the energy scale of a detector. The Fouriertransform methods were introduced to enhance and visualize the structures of mass hierarchy in the frequency spectrum, as first discussed in Ref. [12].",
