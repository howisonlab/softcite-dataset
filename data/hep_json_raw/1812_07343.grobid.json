The analysis targets Q \u2192 W b decays where the W boson decays leptonically. No significant deviation from the expected Standard Model background is observed. Upper limits are set on the QW b coupling strength and the mixing between the Standard Model sector and a singlet T quark or a Y quark from a (B, Y ) doublet or a (T, B, Y ) triplet, taking into account the interference effects with the Standard Model background. The upper limits set on the mixing angle are as small as | sin \u03b8 L | = 0.18 for a singlet T quark of mass 800 GeV, | sin \u03b8 R | = 0.17 for a Y quark of mass 800 GeV in a (B, Y ) doublet model and | sin \u03b8 L | = 0.16 for a Y quark of mass 800 GeV in a (T, B, Y ) triplet model. Within a (B, Y ) doublet model, the limits set on the mixing parameter | sin \u03b8 R | are comparable with the exclusion limits from electroweak precision observables in the mass range between about 900 GeV and 1250 GeV.",

While the discovery of the Higgs boson (H) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2, 3] excludes a perturbative, fourth generation of chiral quarks [4], since their contribution to loop-mediated Higgs boson couplings would significantly alter the production cross-section and the decay rates of the Higgs boson, the effects on Higgs boson production and decay rates from loop diagrams including VLQs are much smaller than the uncertainty in the current measurements [1].

For singlet T quarks, the branching ratios (Bs) are model-and mass-dependent, but in the high-mass limit, which is considered in this analysis, they converge towards 2:1:1 (W b:Zt:Ht) [1]. Due to its charge, the Y quark can decay only into W b and therefore B(Y \u2192 W b) = 100%.

            "text": "Single production of vector-like quarks is enabled by their coupling to SM quarks. As a result, searches for singly produced VLQs in pp collisions can be used to probe these couplings as a function of the VLQ mass, whereas searches for pair-produced VLQs allow limits to be set on VLQ masses; these mass limits are rather insensitive to the couplings, because the signals are produced through strong couplings. At high VLQ masses, single VLQ production can become the dominant production mechanism at the LHC, depending on the strength of the Qqb coupling. Results are presented here for two different models that use different formulations of the Lagrangian that describes these new particles and their interactions. In the model discussed in ref. [1] (renormalisable theory), a mixing term between the SM and vector-like quarks is introduced in a renormalisable extension of the JHEP05(2019)164 SM, while refs. [13,14] (non-renormalisable theory) use a phenomenological Lagrangian that is parameterised with coupling terms, but is non-renormalisable. The main difference between these approaches is that the Lagrangian in refs. [13,14] has additional terms that allow larger production cross-sections, while the Lagrangian in ref. [1] gives a complete description of the dependence of the B on the multiplet dimension, with left-and righthanded mixing angles \u03b8 L and \u03b8 R as model parameters. Within a given multiplet, \u03b8 L and \u03b8 R are functionally related. Therefore, a given value of either the left-or right-handed mixing angle fully determines all Bs for any given heavy-quark mass. For the interpretation in terms of coupling parameters c W b L and c W b R as introduced in refs. [13,14], assumptions must be made about the Q \u2192 W b, Q \u2192 Zt and Q \u2192 Ht Bs in case of Q = T . The relative contribution of the left-and right-handed components of the mixing and coupling also depends on the dimension of the VLQ multiplet. For T singlets, only the left-handed component (sin \u03b8 L or c W b L ) contributes. For a (B, Y ) doublet model, results are interpreted in terms of the dominant right-handed (sin \u03b8 R ) component; for a (T, B, Y ) triplet model, results are interpreted in terms of the dominant left-handed (sin \u03b8 L ) component [1]. The formulation of ref. [1] also allows within a certain multiplet model a comparison of the mixing angles with constraints from electroweak precision observables, such as the ratio R b of the partial width for Z \u2192 bb to the total hadronic Z-boson width and the oblique parameters S and T [15]. A comparison of the respective Lagrangians of the renormalisable models described in ref. [1] and the non-renormalisable models described in refs. [13,14] yields a simple relation between sin \u03b8 L,R and c W b L,R : c W b L,R = \u221a 2 sin \u03b8 L,R for the T singlet model and (B, Y ) doublet model and c W b L = 2 sin \u03b8 L for the (T, B, Y ) triplet model. This relationship is only true within the regime of validity of the renormalisable formulation, and if one considers only the interactions between Q, W and b.",

Assuming a B of 100% for the corresponding decay channel, the best observed T -quark mass limits are m T > 1430 GeV for T \u2192 Ht [23], 1340 GeV for T \u2192 Zt [33] and 1350 GeV for T \u2192 W b [20], independent of the size of the c W b coupling strengths. In ref. [34], seven individual analyses searching for BB or TT pair production were combined improving model-independent cross-section limits significantly over individual analyses. T quarks with a mass lower than 1310 GeV are excluded for any combination of decays into SM particles by this analysis. The observed lower limit on the pair-produced Y -quark mass is 1350 GeV [26]. These searches also report limits as a function of the assumed Bs. The best observed limits are m T > 1310 GeV and m T > 1280 GeV for a weak-isospin doublet [23] and singlet [27] respectively. Searches for single production of T quarks with decays into Zt [31] and single T /Y -quark production with decays into W b [22] were carried out by the ATLAS Collaboration using the Run-1 pp dataset at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV. In the T \u2192 Zt decay channel, assuming a mixing parameter sin \u03b8 L as low as 0.7, T quarks with masses between 450 GeV and 650 GeV are excluded [31], while for a QW b coupling strength of (c W b L ) 2 + (c W b R ) 2 = 1, the observed lower limit on the T -quark mass assuming B(T \u2192 W b) = 0.5 is 950 GeV [22].",

For a mass of 1000 GeV, a T -quark production cross-section times branching fraction above 0.8 pb (0.7 pb) is excluded for the T \u2192 Ht decay channel assuming left-handed (right-handed) coupling of the T quark to SM particles [28]. For Y quarks with a coupling of 0.5 and B(Y \u2192 W b) = 1, the observed (expected) lower mass limit is 1.40 (1.0) TeV [29]. This paper describes a search for Q \u2192 W b (Q = T or Y ) production, with the prompt W boson decaying leptonically, giving a lepton + jets signature characterised by the presence of exactly one electron or muon, 1 three or more jets and missing transverse momentum from the escaping neutrino. It is assumed that T quarks are produced in W b fusion only. For single production of a T quark, Zt fusion could in principle contribute as well, but can be neglected for this T -singlet search. For equal values of the T Zt and T W b couplings, the cross-section for Zt fusion is about one order of magnitude smaller than for W b fusion [14]. For the T -singlet case, the T Zt coupling is about a factor of \u221a 2 smaller than the T W b coupling and as a result B(T \u2192 Zt) is about a factor of two smaller than B(T \u2192 W b).",

For electrons, triggers with a p T threshold of 24 (26) GeV in 2015 (2016) and isolation requirements (in 2016 only) are used along with triggers with a 60 GeV threshold and no isolation requirement, and with a 120 (140) GeV threshold with looser identification criteria.

In addition, events must have at least one reconstructed vertex with two or more tracks with p T above 0.4 GeV that is consistent with the beam-collision region in the x-y plane.

A veto is placed on electrons in the transition region between the barrel and endcap electromagnetic calorimeters, 1.37 < |\u03b7 cluster | < 1.52. Electrons must satisfy the tight likelihood identification criterion, based on shower-shape and track-cluster matching variables, and must have a transverse energy E T = E cluster / cosh(\u03b7 track ) > 25 GeV, where E cluster is the electromagnetic cluster energy and \u03b7 track the track pseudorapidity. Muons are reconstructed [42] by combining a track reconstructed in the ID with one in the MS, using the complete track information from both detectors and accounting for the effects of energy loss and multiple scattering in the material of the detector structure. The muon candidates must satisfy the medium selection criteria [42] and are required to be in the central region of |\u03b7| < 2.5. To reduce the contribution of leptons from hadronic decays (non-prompt leptons), electrons and muons must satisfy isolation criteria that include both track and calorimeter information, and are tuned to give an overall efficiency of 98%, independent of the p T of the lepton.

Each topological cluster is calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale prior to jet reconstruction. The reconstructed jets from the clusters are then calibrated to the particle level by the application of corrections derived from simulation and from dedicated calibration samples of pp collision data at  [51] designed to select jets that originate from the hard scattering and reduce the effect of in-time pile-up. The identification of jets from b-quark decays (b-tagging) is beneficial in this analysis. To identify (tag) jets containing b-hadrons (henceforth referred to as b-jets), a multivariate discriminant is used that combines information about the impact parameters of innerdetector tracks associated with the jet, the presence of displaced secondary vertices, and the reconstructed flight paths of b-and c-hadrons inside the jet [52][53][54][55]. Jets are considered to be b-tagged if the value of the multivariate discriminant is larger than a certain threshold. The criterion in use is only calculated for central jets (|\u03b7| < 2.5) with p T > 25 GeV and has an efficiency of approximately 85% for b-jets in simulated tt events. The rejection factor against jets originating from light quarks and gluons (henceforth referred to as lightflavour jets) is about 34, and that against jets originating from charm quarks (c-jets) is about 3 [54], determined in simulated tt events. Correction factors are defined to correct the tagging rates in the simulation to match the efficiencies measured in the data control samples [54,56].",

The MC samples were processed either through the full ATLAS detector simulation [58] based on Geant4 [59] or through a faster simulation making use of parameterised showers in the calorimeters [60]. Effects of both in-time and outof-time pile-up, from additional pp collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings, were modelled by overlaying minimum-bias interactions generated with Pythia 8.186 [61] according to the luminosity profile of the recorded data. The distribution of the number of additional pp interactions in the MC samples was reweighted to match the pile-up conditions observed in data. All simulated samples used EvtGen [62] to model the decays of heavy-flavour hadrons, except for processes modelled using the Sherpa generator [63]. All simulated events were processed using the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis selection requirements as for the data, but small corrections, obtained from comparisons of simulated events with data in dedicated control regions, were applied to trigger and object reconstruction efficiencies, as well as detector resolutions, to better model the observed response. The main parameters of the MC samples used in this search are summarised in table 1. Samples for all SM background processes were generated with the full Geant4 model of the ATLAS detector.",

The efficiencies are measured in control samples of simulated events, and in data samples of tt events, D * mesons, and jets with impact parameters and secondary vertices consistent with a negative lifetime. Correction factors are defined to correct the tagging rates in the simulation to match the efficiencies measured in the data control samples [54,56]. The uncertainties associated with these measurements are factorised into statistically independent sources and include a total of six independent sources affecting b-jets and four independent sources affecting c-jets. Each of these uncertainties has a different dependence on jet p T . Seventeen sources of uncertainty affecting light-flavour jets are considered, and depend on jet p T and \u03b7. These correction factors are only determined up to a jet p T of 300 GeV for b-and c-jets, and p T of 750 GeV for light-flavour jets. Therefore, an additional uncertainty is included to extrapolate these corrections to jets with p T beyond the kinematic reach of the data calibration samples used; it is taken to be correlated among the three jet flavours. This uncertainty is evaluated in the simulation by comparing the tagging efficiencies while varying, e.g., the fraction of tracks with shared hits in the silicon detectors or the fraction of fake tracks resulting from random combinations of hits, both of which typically increase at high jet p T due to growing track multiplicity and density of hits within the jet. Finally, an uncertainty related to the application of c-jet scale factors to \u03c4 -jets is considered, but has a negligible impact in this analysis [56].",

A background-only fit in the SR and CRs shows that the interfering SM contribution, the shape of which is taken from the fully reconstructed MC simulation mentioned above, is in agreement with the size used to simulate the interference templates (\u03c3 I ) and can affect the total postfit background yield by about 4 %. This effect can be accounted for by adding the shape of the interfering SM background as an additional systematic uncertainty in the tt template (see section 6). Studies show that the expected and observed limits change by significantly less than one standard deviation with the addition of this systematic uncertainty. For the right-handed Y in a (B, Y ) doublet model, the interfering SM background contributions are much smaller than other background contributions in the SR and the CRs and are therefore negligible. Nonetheless, the non-simulated SM contributions mentionned above, which would lead to interference with a left-handed Y in a (T, B, Y ) triplet model or a T singlet quark, are non-negligible and are therefore taken into account in the fit by the same additional systematic uncertainty in the tt template. Since the interfering SM contributions are not explicitly taken into account in the fit, upper limits on the total cross-section for pp \u2192 W bq, \u03c3 tot = \u03c3 VLQ + \u03c3 I + \u03c3 SM , times branching ratio can not be determined, but limits on the coupling value of the vector-like T or Y quark to W b in a given model based on \u03c3 VLQ + \u03c3 I are set.",

            "text": "reduction becomes stronger with increasing mass and coupling value and is about 40% at a Q mass of 1500 GeV and a coupling value of 0.9. From the upper limit on \u03c3 VLQ + \u03c3 I , a corresponding coupling value c W b is calculated, a new signal template h VLQ+I (m VLQ ; c W b ) is constructed using the reweighting technique described above, and the fit repeated until convergence is observed in the coupling value c W b . It is explicitly checked that the result of the iterative procedure does not depend on the choice of starting value for c W b , by repeating the full iterative process with a lower or higher starting value than the one at convergence. If the coupling converges to a value smaller than the signal-production value of 0.5, the iterative procedure is repeated with a coupling much lower than the value at convergence. A systematic uncertainty of about 2.5% for the coupling reweighting and a shape uncertainty for the interference contribution are assigned to this procedure. Depending on the binning of the m VLQ distribution, it is possible that negative entries occur in some bins of the signal-plus-interference template due to the interference effect when large couplings are considered, and this poses a problem in the limit-setting procedure. To avoid this problem, the last bins in the reconstructed m VLQ distribution are merged until no negative bin entries exist. As a result, a different binning in the m VLQ distribution is chosen for each VLQ mass hypothesis for the T -singlet case and for the left-handed Y case, which guarantees (independent of c W b ) that all bins in the signalplus-interference template have positive values. The rebinning reduces the sensitivity for high-mass T and left-handed Y signals. As an example, figure 7 shows the fitted VLQ candidate mass distributions for left-handed Y signals with masses of 900 GeV and 1500 GeV and for left-handed T signals with masses of 800 GeV and 1200 GeV. For the T singlet model, the total integral of the signal-plus-interference template at reconstruction level can become negative for VLQ mass hypotheses above 1200 GeV. As a result, no coupling-value limits are set for the T singlet model with masses above 1200 GeV. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarise the observed and expected 95% CL s upper limits on the coupling value and limits on the mixing angle as a function of Q-quark mass, for the T singlet model (assuming B(T \u2192 W b) \u2248 0.5), the right-handed Y in a (B, Y ) doublet model, and the left-handed Y in a (T, B, Y ) triplet model respectively. The parameterisation of ref. [1] in terms of rightor left-handed mixing angles is chosen for the coupling limits; these can be easily translated to the parameterisation of ref. [14]  In figure 8, these direct mixing-angle bounds are compared with those from electroweak precision observables taken from ref. [1], assuming that there are no multiplets other than the one considered. For the (B, Y ) doublet model, the bounds presented here are competitive with the indirect constraints for VLQ masses between 800 GeV and 1250 GeV.    for a left-handed T quark in a T singlet model with masses of 800 GeV to 1200 GeV assuming B(T \u2192 W b) = 0.5.

            "text": "A search for the production of a single vector-like quark Q, where Q can be either a T or Y quark, with the subsequent decay into W b has been carried out with the ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data used in this search correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions with a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016. The selected events have exactly one isolated electron or muon, a high-p T b-tagged jet, missing transverse momentum and at least one forward jet. The Q candidate is fully reconstructed and its mass is used as a discriminating variable in a maximum-likelihood fit. The observed data distributions are compatible with the expected Standard Model background and no significant excess is observed. The search result is interpreted for Q = T in a T singlet model and Q = Y in either a (B, Y ) doublet model or in a (T, B, Y ) triplet model, taking into account the interference effect with the Standard Model background. Limits at 95% CL are set on the cross-section times branching ratio as a function of the VLQ mass in the case of the (B, Y ) doublet model, where interference has the smallest effect. The search results are translated into limits on the QW b mixing angle or coupling. In the T -singlet case, the 95% CL limit on | sin \u03b8 L | (c  R for a (B, Y ) doublet model assuming a branching ratio B(Y \u2192 W b) = 1, as a function of the VLQ mass. The surrounding bands correspond to \u00b11 and \u00b12 standard deviations around the expected limit. The excluded region is given by the area above the solid line. Constraints from electroweak precision observables, which are only valid for the mixing angles, from either the S and T parameters (dashed-dotted line) or from the R b values (long-dashed line), are also shown. These constraints are taken from ref. [1], where they are presented as a function of m B (in the (B, Y ) doublet case), respectively, m T (in the (T, B, Y ) triplet case) and translated to m Y using the value of the corresponding mixing angle constraint. masses between 800 GeV and 1800 GeV and the | sin \u03b8 R | bounds presented here are below the indirect electroweak constraints for masses between about 900 GeV and 1250 GeV where exclusion limits on | sin \u03b8 R | are around 0.18-0.19. In the case of the (T, Y, B) triplet, the limits on | sin \u03b8 L | (c W b L ) vary between 0.16 and 0.39 (0.31 and 0.78) for masses from 800 GeV to 1600 GeV. For all signal scenarios explored, this analysis is found to significantly improve upon the reach of previous searches.  Figure 9.
