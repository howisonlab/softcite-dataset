The electroweak cross section for the jj final state (with = e or \u03bc and j representing the quarks produced in the hard interaction) in the kinematic region defined by M > 50 GeV, M jj > 120 GeV, transverse momentum p Tj > 25 GeV, and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 j | < 5, is found to be \u03c3 EW ( jj) = 174 \u00b1 15 (stat) \u00b1 40 (syst) fb, in agreement with the standard model prediction. The associated jet activity of the selected events is studied, in particular in a signalenriched region of phase space, and the measurements are found to be in agreement with QCD predictions.",

This process is however predicted to have a distinctive signature of two jets of very high energy and large jj invariant mass, M jj , separated by a large rapidity interval that can be occupied by the two charged leptons and where extra gluon emission is suppressed [2,3]. We refer to jets produced through the fragmentation of the outgoing quarks in pure EW processes as \"tagging jets\", and to the process from which they originate as \"EW Zjj\". Figure 1 shows representative Feynman diagrams for the EW Zjj processes, namely (left) vector boson fusion (VBF), (middle) bremsstrahlung-like, and (right) multiperipheral * e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch production.

Both results have been found to agree with the expectations of the SM. Our present work reflects the measurement at CMS using pp collision data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV during 2012 that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . As the signal-to-background ratio for the measurement is small, different methods are used to enhance the signal fraction, to confirm the presence of the signal, and to measure the cross section. Besides the two multivariate analyses, based on the methods developed for the 7 TeV analysis [11], a new method is presented, using a model of the main background based on real pp collisions. The analysis of the 8 TeV data, offers the opportunity of reducing the uncertainties of the 7 TeV measurements, given the larger integrated luminosity, and to add robustness to the results with the new data-based method.

Muons are reconstructed by fitting trajectories based on hits in the silicon tracker and in the outer muon system [44]. Reconstructed electron or muon candidates are required to have p T > 20 GeV. Electron candidates are required to be reconstructed within |\u03b7| \u2264 2.5, excluding the CMS barrel-to-endcap transition region of the ECAL [45], and muon candidates are required to be reconstructed in the fiducial region |\u03b7| \u2264 2.4 of the tracker system. The track associated to a lepton candidate is required to have both its transverse and longitudinal impact parameters compatible with the position of the primary vertex (PV) of the event. The PV for each event is defined as the one with the largest p 2 T , where the sum runs over all the tracks used to fit the vertex. A particle-based relative isolation parameter is computed for each lepton, and corrected on an event-by-event basis for contributions from pileup. The particle candidates used to compute the isolation variable are reconstructed with the particle flow algorithm which will be detailed later. We require that the sum of the scalar p T of all particle candidates reconstructed in an isolation cone with radius R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 0.4 around the lepton's momentum vector is <10 or <12 % of the electron or muon p T value, respectively. The two leptons with opposite electric charge and with highest p T are chosen to form the dilepton pair. Same-flavour dileptons (ee or \u03bc\u03bc) compatible with Z \u2192 decays are then selected by requiring |M Z \u2212 M | < 15 GeV, where M Z is the mass of the Z boson [19].",

            "text": "Two types of jets are used in the analysis: \"jet-plus-track\" (JPT) [46] and particle-flow (PF) [14] jets. Both cases use the anti-k T algorithm [47,48] with a distance parameter of 0.5 to define jets. The information from the ECAL, HCAL and tracker are used by both algorithms in distinct ways. The JPT algorithm improves the energy response and resolution of calorimeter jets by incorporating additional tracking information. For JPT jets the associated tracks are classified as in-cone or out-of-cone if they point to within or outside the jet cone around the jet axis at the surface of the calorimeter. The momenta of both in-cone and out-ofcone tracks are then added to the energy of the associated calorimeter jet and for in-cone tracks the expected average energy deposition in the calorimeters is subtracted based on the momentum of the track. The direction of the jet axis is also corrected by the algorithm. As a result, the JPT algorithm improves both the energy and the direction of the jet. The PF algorithm [49,50] combines the information from all relevant CMS sub-detectors to identify and reconstruct particle candidates in the event: muons, electrons, photons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons. The PF jets are constructed by clustering these particle candidates and the jet momentum is defined as the vectorial sum of the momenta of all particle candidates. An area-based correction is applied to both JPT and PF jets, to account for the extra energy that is clustered through in-time pileup [51,52]. Jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER) for JPT and PF jets are derived from simulation and confirmed with in situ measurements of the p T balance observed in exclusive dijet and Z/photon+jet events. The simulation is corrected so that it describes the JER from real data. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. Jet identification criteria are furthermore applied to remove contributions from jets clustered from pileup events. These criteria are described in more detail in Ref. [53]. As will be detailed in Sect. 5.1, the efficiency of these algorithms has been measured in data and it is observed to be compatible with the expectations from simulation across the full pseudorapidity range used in the analysis.",

Thus, we build a data-based model for the shapes of the distributions of the kinematic observables of the tagging jets from \u03b3 jj events selected in a similar way as the Zjj ones. The differences, specific to the Z or photon-sample, are expected to be mitigated by reweighting the p T of the photons to the p T of the Z candidates. From simulation, we expect that the differences between the \u03b3 and Z masses do not contribute significantly when matching the dijet kinematics between the two samples after M jj > 2M Z is required. Given that the photon sample is affected by multijet production, and that the selection of the low-p T region in data is also affected by very large prescaling at the trigger stages, we impose tighter kinematic constraints on the reconstructed boson, with respect to the ones applied at preselection (Sect. 4). To match effectively the Z and photon kinematics, we require p T (Z or \u03b3 ) > 50 GeV and rapidity |y(Z or \u03b3 )| < 1.44. The rapidity requirement corresponds to the physical boundary of the central (barrel) region of the CMS ECAL [45].   The method is checked in simulation by characterising the DY Zjj or direct photon events in different physical regions defined according to the reconstructed M jj and comparing both distributions. Figure 5 illustrates the compatibility of simulated events with a high dijet invariant mass. Good agreement is found for the \u03b7 of the most forward jet, the \u03b7 jj variable and the ratio between the p T of the dijet system to the scalar sum of the tagging jets",

As discussed previously, the EW Zjj signal is characterised by a large \u03b7 jj jet separation that stems from the small-angle scattering of the two initial partons. Owing to both the topological configuration and the large p T of the outgoing partons, the M jj variable is also expected to be large. The evolution of \u03b7 jj with M jj is expected to be different in signal and background events and therefore these characteristics are expected to yield the best separation power between the EW Zjj and the DY Zjj productions. In addition, one can exploit the fact that the Z-boson candidate is expected to be produced centrally in the rapidity region defined by the two tagging jets and that the Zjj system is approximately balanced in the transverse plane. As a consequence, we expect the signal to be found with lower values of both y * and p hard T , compared to the DY background. Other variables which can be used to enhance the separation are related to the kinematics of the event ( p T , rapidity, and distance between the jets and/or the Z boson) or to the properties of the jets that are expected to be initiated by quarks. We combine these variables using three alternative multivariate analyses with the goal of cross-checking the final result. All three analyses make use of boosted decision tree (BDT) discriminators implemented using tmva package [56] to achieve the best expected separation between the EW Zjj and DY Zjj processes.",

A multivariate discriminator making use of the dijet and Z boson kinematics is built. A choice is made for variables which are robust against JES uncertainties. Extra discrimination information, related to the q/g nature of the jet, is included. All processes are modelled from simulation, and the description of each variable is verified by comparing data with the simulation-based expectations in control regions. Analysis B uses only the dimuon final state and the JPT jet reconstruction approach. It builds a discriminator which tries to profit from the full kinematics of the event including the tagging jets and the Z boson. Similarly to analysis A it expands one of the cross-check procedures previously adopted for the 7 TeV measurement [11] and relies on simulation-based prediction of the backgrounds. Analysis C uses solely dijet-related variables in the multivariate discriminator and selects both the dimuon and dielectron final states with PF jets. Lepton-related selection variables are not used as the main background is derived from the photon control sample. In this analysis events are split in four categories for M jj values in the intervals 450-550 GeV, 550-750 GeV, 750-1,000 GeV, and above 1,000 GeV, which have been chosen to have similar numbers of expected signal events.

The statistical methodology used is similar to the one used in the CMS Higgs analysis [5] using asymptotic formulas [58]. In this procedure some of the systematic uncertainties affecting the measurement of the signal strength are partially constrained. The DY Zjj strength is constrained by the uncertainties in analyses A and B and is free to change in C. In all cases the difference of the result relative to the one that would have been obtained without taking the interference term into account, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty of the measurement. This shall be discussed in more detail in the next section where the systematic uncertainties affecting our analysis are summarised.  Trigger and selection efficiencies-We assign total 2 and 3 % uncertainties on the total trigger and selection efficiencies in the ee and \u03bc\u03bc channels, respectively. These uncertainties have been estimated by comparing the lepton efficiencies expected in simulation and measured in data with a \"tag-and-probe\" method [60]. Jet energy scale and resolution-The energy of the jets enters in our analysis not only at the selection level but also in the computation of the kinematic variables used in forming discriminants. The uncertainty on JES affects therefore both the expected event yields, through the migration of events to different bins, and the final distributions. In addition to the standard JES uncertainty, the residual difference in the response observed in the balancing of a Z or \u03b3 candidate with a jet, discussed in Sect. 5, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The effect of the JES uncertainty is studied by rescaling up and down the reconstructed jet energy by a p T -and \u03b7-dependent scale factor [14]. An analogous approach is used for the JER. In both cases the uncertainties are derived separately of PF and JPT jets. q/g discriminator-The uncertainty on the performance of the q/g discriminator has been measured using independent Z+jet and dijet data, after comparing with the corresponding simulation predictions [54]. The parametrization of the estimated uncertainty is used on an eventper-event basis to derive alternative predictions for the signal and background which are profiled in the fit for the signal. Pileup-Pileup is not expected to affect the identification and isolation of the leptons or the corrected energy of the jets. When the jet clustering algorithm is run, pileup can, however, induce a distortion of the reconstructed dijet system due to the contamination of tracks and calorimetric deposits. We evaluate this uncertainty by generating two alternative distributions after changing the number of pileup interactions by \u00b15 %, according to the uncertainty on the inelastic pp cross section at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

The differences are particularly noticeable at very large M jj and at large y * . For the data-based modelling of DY Zjj we consider the effect induced on the discriminant functions from five distinct sources. Not all are of theoretical nature, nevertheless, we list them here for simplicity. We consider not only the statistical size of the photon sample but also the difference observed in data selected with a loose-photon selection relative to the data selected with a tight-photon selection. From simulation, the expected difference, between the tight-photon selection and a pure photon sample is also considered, and added in quadrature to the previous. Furthermore, we consider the envelope of the PDF changes induced in the simulated compatibility tests, and the contamination from residual EW \u03b3 jj events in the photon sample. For the latter, we assign a 30 % uncertainty to the EW \u03b3 jj contribution, which is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty in the simulated events for this process. Normalisation of residual backgrounds-Diboson and topquark processes are modelled with a MC simulation. Thus, we assign an intrinsic uncertainty in their normalisation according to their uncertainty which arises from the PDF and factorisation/renormalisation scales. The uncertainties are assigned based on [31,37,40]. Interference between EW Zjj and DY Zjj -The difference observed in the fit when the interference term is neglected relative to the nominal result is used to estimate the uncertainty due to the interference of the signal and the background. Table 2 summarises the systematic uncertainties described above. We give their magnitudes at the input level, and whether they are treated as normalisation uncertainties or uncertainties in the distributions used to fit the data. The uncertainties are organised according to their experimental or theoretical nature.",

Table 4 reports the event yields obtained in each category for method C. Fair agreement is observed between data and expectations for the sum of signal and background, for both methods, in all categories. The signal strength is extracted from the fit to the discriminator shapes as discussed in Sect. 6. Table 5 summarises the results obtained for the fits to the signal strengths in each method. The results obtained are compatible among the dilepton channels and different methods, and in agreement with the SM prediction of unity. Methods A and B are dominated by the systematic uncertainty stemming from the modelling of the DY Zjj background and the interference with the EW Zjj signal. Method C is dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the fit and, due to tighter selection criteria, is expected to be less affected by the modelling of the interference. In method C, the DY Zjj modelling uncertainty is partially due to the statistics of the photon sample. With the exception of jet energy resolution, which has a larger impact in method C due to its tighter M jj selection, all other uncertainties are of similar magnitude for the different methods.

These observables are measured using events that are required to satisfy the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and Z \u2192 ee selection criteria of analyses A and B. These observables are investigated following the prescriptions and suggestions from Ref. [62], where the model dependence is estimated by comparing different generators. Figures 11 and 12 show the average number of jets and the average cos \u03c6 jj as a function of the total H T and \u03b7 jj . The MadGraph + pythia (ME-PS) predictions are in good agreement with the data, even in the regions of largest H T and \u03b7 jj . In both cases we estimate that the contribution from EW Zjj is < 1 %. Jet multiplicity increases both as function of H T and \u03b7 jj . The increase of H T and \u03b7 jj induces, in average, an increase of jet multiplicity and leads to different dijet configurations in the azimuthal plane. In average the two selected jets are separated by 120 0 deg, independently of H T . This separation tends to decrease for larger \u03b7 jj separation. The behavior observed for cos \u03c6 jj when \u03b7 jj < 0.5 is related to the jet distance parameter used in the reconstruction (R = 0.5). In data, the separation of the jets in the cos \u03c6 jj variable, is observed to be <5 % smaller with respect to the simulation.",
