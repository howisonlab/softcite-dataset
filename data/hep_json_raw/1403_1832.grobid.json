The ratio R of the production rates is obtained to be (\u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 \u00b1 Zc(3900) \u2213 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) = 21.5 \u00b1 3.3(stat) \u00b1 7.5(syst))%. At the same time Belle also measured the cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 between 3.8 GeV and 5.5 GeV with 967 fb \u2212 1 data sample collected by the Belle detector at or near the \u03a5(nS) (n=1,2,..., 5) resonances. 36 The Y (4260) is observed and its resonant parameters are determined. In the Y (4260) signal region, the peak state Z(3900) \u00b1 is observed with a mass of (3894.5 \u00b1 6.6 \u00b1 4.5) MeV/c 2 and a width of (63 \u00b1 24 \u00b1 26) MeV in the \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 mass spectrum with a statistical significance larger than 5.2\u03c3. This new charged state is refer to as the Z c (3900) or Z c (3895). Here the ratio of the production rates is obtained from a one-dimentional fit to be B(Y (4260)\u2192Z(3900) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 )B(Z(3900) \u00b1 \u2192\u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8) B(Y (4260)\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) = (29.0 \u00b1 8.9) %, where the error is statistical only. For this fit the possible interferences between other amplitides are not included. This structure couples to charmonium and has an electric charge, which is suggestive of a state containing four quarks including cc and light quarks ud. The Fig. 5 shows the fit results from BESIII (left) and Belle (right). Unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the distribution of M (\u03c0J/\u03c8), using the larger one of the two combinations. The same signal shape for both experiments is parameterized as an S-wave BW function convolved with a Gaussian whose mass resolution is fixed at their own MC-estimated values depending on detectors.",

Here the large Z c signal yield permitted the establishment of the J P quantum number of the \u03c0Z c system to be 1 + . Assuming the Z c (3885) \u2192 DD \u2212 * signal and the Z c (3900) \u2192 \u03c0J/\u03c8 signal are from the same source, the partial width ratio \u0393(Zc(3885)\u2192DD \u2212 * ) \u0393(Zc(3900)\u2192\u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 = 6.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 2.7 is determined.

The proximity to the BB * and B * B * threshold mass suggest that these Z b states may be a molecular type state formed by two mesons. This interpretaion can be checked by studying the Z b \u2192 BB * and Z b \u2192 B * B * in the \u03a5 \u2192 \u03c0B(B * )B * three body decay. 34Figure 4shows two distinct peaks at the masses of Z b (10610) and Z b (10650). In this fit the mass was fixed to the earlier measurements. This three body decay analysis is extended to \u03a5(10860) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03a5(10860) \u2192 h b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 to measure not only the newly observed Z b states but also the fractions of individual contribution to the whole three-body signals. The relative fractions for Z b are B(Z b (10610)\u2192BB * ) B(Z b (10610)\u2192\u03c0 + (bb)) = 6.2 \u00b1 0.7 and B(Z b (10650)\u2192B * B * ) B(Z b (10650)\u2192\u03c0 + (bb)) = 2.8 \u00b1 0.4, here statistical errors added only.",
