            "text": "At e + e \u2212 colliders, charmonium states with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , such as the J /\u03c8 , \u03c8(3686), and \u03c8(3770), are produced through electronpositron annihilation into a virtual photon. These charmonium states can then decay into light hadrons through either the threegluon process (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2192 ggg \u2192 hadrons) or the one-photon process (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 hadrons). In addition to the above two processes, the non-resonant process (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 hadrons) plays an important role, especially in the \u03c8(3770) energy region where the non-resonant production cross section is comparable to the resonant one.",

            "text": "The \u03c8(3770), the lowest lying 1 \u2212\u2212 charmonium state above the DD threshold, is expected to decay dominantly into the OZIallowed DD final states [1,2]. However, assuming no interference effects between resonant and non-resonant amplitudes, the BES Collaboration found a large total non-DD branching fraction of (14.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 5.8)% [3][4][5][6]. A later work by the CLEO Collaboration, which included interference between one-photon resonant and one-photon non-resonant amplitudes (assuming no interference with the three-gluon amplitude), found a contradictory non-DD branching fraction of (\u22123.3 \u00b1 1.4 +6.6 \u22124.8 )% [7]. These different results could be caused by interference effects. Moreover, it has been noted that the interference of the non-resonant (continuum) amplitude with the three-gluon resonant amplitude should not be neglected [8]. To clarify the situation, many exclusive non-DD decays of the \u03c8(3770) have been investigated [9,10]. Low statistics, however, especially in the scan data sets have not permitted the inclusion of interference effects in these exclusive studies. BESIII has collected the world's largest data sample of e + e \u2212 collisions at 3.773 GeV. Analyzed together with data samples taken during a \u03c8(3770) line-shape scan, investigations of exclusive decays, taking into account the interference of resonant and nonresonant amplitudes are now possible. Recently, the decay channel of \u03c8(3770) \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 [11] has been studied considering the above mentioned interference. In this Letter, we report on a study of the two-body final state e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp in the vicinity of the \u03c8(3770) based on data sets collected with the upgraded Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) located at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPCII) [12]. The data sets include 2917 pb \u22121 of data at 3.773 GeV, 44.5 pb \u22121 of data at 3.65 GeV [13], and data taken during a \u03c8(3770) line-shape scan in the energy range from 3.74 to 3.90 GeV.",

The BESIII detector is a high-performance general purpose detector. It is composed of a helium-gas based drift chamber (MDC) for charged-particle tracking and particle identification by specific ionization dE/dx, a plastic scintillator time-offlight (TOF) system for additional particle identification, a CsI (Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) for electron identification and photon detection, a super-conducting solenoid magnet providing a 1.0 Tesla magnetic field, and a muon detector composed of resistive-plate chambers. The momentum resolution for charged particles at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%. The energy resolution of 1 GeV photons is 2.5%. More details on the accelerator and detector can be found in Ref. [12].",

The BaBar Collaboration [21,22] has taken into account bremsstrahlung, e + e \u2212 self-energy and vertex corrections in their radiative correction. Vacuum polarization is included in their reported cross section. This corrected cross section, which is the sum of the Born cross section and the contribution of vacuum polarization, is called the dressed cross section. In order to use the BaBar measurements of \u03c3 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp) [21,22] in our investigation, a radiative correction is performed to calculate the dressed cross section using the method described in Refs. [16,17]. With the observed cross sections as our initial input, a fit to the line-shape equation (Eq. (1)) is performed iteratively. At each iteration, the ISR correction factors are calculated and the dressed cross sections are updated. The calculation converges after a few iterations (\u223c 5). The dressed cross section at each data point is listed in Table 1. As a reference, the Born cross sections are also calculated and given in Table 1. The Born cross section around 3.773 GeV is in excellent agreement with a previous measurement obtained with CLEO data [23]. Summary of results at center-of-mass energies from 3.65 to 3.90 GeV.

To obtain a conservative uncertainty, an alternative MC simulated sample with \u03b1 = 0.683 is used and the difference in the results (1.0%) is taken as the uncertainty.

The future P ANDA (anti-Proton ANnihilations at DArmstadt) experiment is one of the key projects at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), which is currently under construction at GSI, Darmstadt. It will perform precise studies of antiprotonproton annihilations with various internal proton or nuclear targets and an antiproton beam in the momentum range from 1.5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c. In P ANDA, a detailed investigation of the charmonium spectrum and the open charm channels is foreseen. For this physics program, it is important to obtain experimental information on the so far unknown open charm cross sections, both to evaluate luminosity requirements and to design detector. Theoretical estimations vary with several orders of magnitude [33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41]. In the physics performance report for P ANDA [42], the DD production cross section is estimated to be 6.35 nb, with the unknown branching ratio of \u03c8(3770) \u2192 pp scaled from the known ratio of J /\u03c8 \u2192 pp. In this paper, the cross section of \u03c3 (pp \u2192 \u03c8(3770)) has been determined. As the first charmonium state above the DD threshold, \u03c8(3770) could be used as a source of open charm production.",

To extract the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) \u2192 pp, a fit, taking into account the interference of resonant and continuum amplitudes, is performed. In this investigation, the measured cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp from the BaBar experiment are included in a simultaneous fit to put more constraints on the continuum amplitude. The dressed cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) \u2192 pp is extracted from the fit and shown in Ta-",
