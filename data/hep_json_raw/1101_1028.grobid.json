In addition, we report the differential branching ratio and the muon forward-backward asymmetry in the B + and B 0 decay modes, and the K * 0 longitudinal polarization fraction in the B 0 decay mode with respect to the squared dimuon mass. These are consistent with the predictions, and most recent determinations from other experiments and of comparable accuracy. We also report the first observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay and measure its branching ratio BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = [1.44 \u00b1 0.33 \u00b1 0.46] \u00d7 10 \u22126 using 27 \u00b1 6 signal events.

Accurate SM predictions make the b \u2192 s\u2113\u2113 phenomenology suited to uncover early indications of new physics [1][2][3], especially through observables like the lepton forwardbackward asymmetry (A FB ) and the differential branching fraction (BR) as a function of dilepton mass M \u2113\u2113 . The b \u2192 s\u2113\u2113 amplitudes can be described in terms of short distance operators and effective Wilson coefficients C 7,9,10 . Some new physics models [1] allow the flipped sign of C 7 . This results in the opposite sign of A FB in the small q 2 region (q 2 \u2261 M 2 \u2113\u2113 c 2 ). Recently, BaBar and Belle [4] measured an A FB in the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decay larger than the SM expectation. The decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6(1020)\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has not been seen in previous searches by CDF [5] and D0 [6].",

We determine N s by Eq. 1with the world average BR and NN cut efficiency of the simulated signal events, and determine N b from the number of sideband events scaled to the signal region, which is defined as \u00b12\u03c3 from the world average B mass, and NN cut efficiency of the sideband events. For B 0 s decays, N s is taken from a theoretical prediction [13]. We maximize N s /(5/2 + \u221a N b ) [14]. The signal yield is obtained by an unbinned maximum log-likelihood fit to the B candidate invariant mass distribution. The likelihood is given by L = (f sig P sig + (1 \u2212 f sig )P bg ), where f sig is the signal fraction, P sig is the signal probability density functions (PDF) parametrized with two Gaussian distributions with different means, and P bg is the background PDF modeled with a first-or second-order polynomial. The signal PDF's are determined from the simulated signal and the B mass resolution is scaled by the ratio of the mass resolution in J/\u03c8h data and simulation, which ranges from 1.07 to 1.09. The background PDF's are determined from sideband data. Fitted parameters are f sig , the mean B mass, and the background shape. The fit range for B + and B 0 (B 0 s ) decays is from 5.18 (5.00) to 5.70 GeV/c 2 , to avoid the region dominated by the physics background.",

Points are the fit result. The solid curves are the SM expectation[1]. Two solid curves in (a, b) use maximum-and minimum-allowed form factors on differential BR plots. The dotted curves are the C7 = \u2212C SM 7 expectation. The dashed line is the averaged expectation in each squared dimuon mass bin and hatched regions are charmonium veto regions.",
