No indication of an H-dibaryon with mass near the MH = 2m\u039b threshold is seen in either the H \u2192 \u039bp\u03c0 \u2212 or \u039b\u039b decay channels and 90% confidence level branching-fraction upper limits are set that are between one and two orders of magnitude below the measured branching fractions for inclusive \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays to antideuterons. Since \u03a5(1S, 2S) decays produce flavor-SU (3)-symmetric final states, these results put stringent constraints on H-dibaryon properties. The results are based on analyses of 102 million \u03a5(1S) and 158 million \u03a5(2S) events collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider.",

The acceptance decreases and, therefore, the limits increase, with increasing lifetime: for \u03c4 H = 5\u03c4 \u039b , the acceptance is a factor of two lower and the limits are correspondingly twice as high. Conversely, for shorter lifetimes, the acceptance increases: for \u03c4 = 0.5\u03c4 \u039b , the acceptance is higher and the limits are more stringent by 12 \u00b1 2%. The results reported here are some of the most stringent constraints to date on the existence of an Hdibaryon with mass near the 2m \u039b threshold [26]. These upper limits are between one and two orders of magnitude below the average of the PDG value for inclusive \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays to antideuterons. Since \u03a5 \u2192 hadrons decays produce final states that are flavor-SU (3) symmetric, this suggests that if an H-dibaryon exists in this mass range, it must have very different dynamical properties than the deuteron, or, in the case of M H < 2m \u039b , a strongly suppressed H \u2192 \u039bp\u03c0 \u2212 decay mode.",

The +1\u03c3 (+2\u03c3) values from the fitted signal yields are shown as the dotted (dashed) bars. (For some mass bins, these are negative and not shown.) The vertical dotted line indicates the MH = 2m\u039b threshold. The limits below (above) the 2m\u039b threshold are for f1 = \u039bp\u03c0 \u2212 (f2 = \u039b\u039b). The horizontal dotted line indicates the average PDG value for B(\u03a5(1S, 2S) \u2192d X).",
