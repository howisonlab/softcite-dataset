The measurement is performed for invariant masses of the lepton pairs, m , between 46 and 200 GeV using a sample of 20.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions data at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012. The data are presented in bins of invariant mass, absolute dilepton rapidity, |y |, and the angular variable cos \u03b8 * between the outgoing lepton and the incoming quark in the Collins-Soper frame. The measurements are performed in the range |y | < 2.4 in the muon channel, and extended to |y | < 3.6 in the electron channel. The cross sections are used to determine the Z boson forward-backward asymmetry as a function of |y | and m . The measurements achieve high-precision, below the percent level in the pole region, excluding the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity, and are in agreement with predictions. These precision data are sensitive to the parton distribution functions and the effective weak mixing angle.",

This decay angle depends on the sine of the weak mixing angle, sin 2 \u03b8 W , which enters in the fermionic vector couplings to the Z boson. At leading order in electroweak (EW) theory it is given by sin 2 \u03b8 W = 1 \u2212 m 2 W /m 2 Z , where m W and m Z are the W and Z boson masses, respectively. Higher-order loop corrections modify this relation depending on the renormalisation scheme used, and so experimental measurements are often given in terms of the sine of the effective weak mixing angle, sin 2 \u03b8 eff [3]. High-precision cross-section measurements sensitive to the asymmetry, and therefore to the effective weak mixing angle, provide a testing ground for EW theory and could offer some insight into physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).",

Charged particles in the pseudorapidity 1 range |\u03b7| < 2.5 are reconstructed with the ID, which consists of layers of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors and a strawtube transition-radiation tracker having a coverage of |\u03b7| < 2.0. The ID is immersed in a 2 T magnetic field provided by the solenoid. The latter is surrounded by a hermetic calorimeter that covers |\u03b7| < 4.9 and provides three-dimensional reconstruction of particle showers. The electromagnetic calorimeter is a liquid-argon sampling calorimeter, which uses lead absorbers for |\u03b7| < 3.2. The hadronic sampling calorimeter uses plastic scintillator tiles as the active material and steel absorbers in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7. In the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2, liquid argon is used as the active material, with copper absorbers. A forward calorimeter covers the range 3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9 which also uses liquid argon as the active material, and copper and tungsten absorbers for the EM and hadronic sections of the subdetector, respectively. Outside the calorimeters, air-core toroids supply the magnetic field for the MS. There, three layers of precision chambers allow the accurate measurement of muon track curvature in the region |\u03b7| < 2.7. The majority of these precision chambers is composed of drift tubes, while cathode-strip chambers provide coverage in the inner layers of the forward region 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.7. The muon trigger in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 uses resistive-plate chambers in the central region and thin-gap chambers in the forward region. A three-level trigger system [28] selects events to be recorded for offline analysis.",

The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 differential cross section as a function of mass has been calculated at NNLO in perturbative QCD (pQCD) using FEWZ 3.1 [35][36][37] with the MSTW2008NNLO PDF set [38]. The renormalisation, \u00b5 r , and factorisation, \u00b5 f , scales were both set equal to m . The calculation includes NLO EW corrections beyond final-state photon radiation (FSR) using the G \u00b5 EW scheme [39]. A mass-dependent K-factor used to scale the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 MC sample is obtained from the ratio of the calculated total NNLO pQCD cross section with the additional EW corrections, to the total cross section from the Powheg sample. This one-dimensional (and therefore partial) NNLO K-factor is found to vary from 1.035 at the lowest invariant mass values considered in this analysis to 1.025 at the highest. This factor also improves the modelling of the Z boson lineshape. The DY production of \u03c4 pairs was modelled using Powheg in the same way as the signal simulation.",

The data were collected using two single-electron triggers in the central calorimeter region with E e T > 24 GeV or E e T > 60 GeV. The lower-threshold trigger has additional criteria for the shower shape and energy deposited in the vicinity of the electron candidate. The reconstructed central electrons are required to have E e T > 25 GeV, |\u03b7 e | < 2.4, and must satisfy the \"tight\" identification criteria.

Such ID misalignments bias the measurement of the muon track sagitta and have an opposite effect on the momentum of positively-and negatively-charged muons. Hence, the reconstructed invariant mass or rapidity of muon pairs are not affected, in contrast to measurements of cos \u03b8 * which are charge-dependent. These residual inner detector misalignments are corrected for based on two methods, one which uses Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events, and another using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events as described in reference [65].

The normalisation uncertainty in the top quark background, which is dominated by tt production, is taken to be 6% following the PDF4LHC prescription [69]. The uncertainty includes scale and \u03b1 S variations and also takes into account the uncertainty in the top-quark mass. Diboson (W W , W Z and ZZ) production is another important background source for which the normalisation uncertainties are about 10%. See reference [17] for additional information on the normalisation uncertainties of the various Monte Carlo samples used. The background contributions from W +jet processes are assigned a normalisation uncertainty of 5% for the central rapidity measurements. For the high rapidity electron channel, where W +jet is a dominant background, a variation of 60% is considered (see section 7.4).",

For each variation the change in the unfolded cross section is found to be much smaller than the change in the predicted cross section using each eigenvector PDF set. Changing the PDF set can alter the predicted cross section by up to a few percent but the influence on the unfolded result is less than 0.1%. Furthermore, the change in the unfolded result, using one to five iterations of unfolding, is much smaller than the total uncertainty in the data. This study is repeated by reweighting the signal MC events to different values of the scattering amplitude coefficient A 4 = 8 3 A FB , which is proportional to sin 2 \u03b8 W .

The magnitude of A FB is smallest for |y | = 0 and increases to a maximum in the region 1.0 < |y | < 2.0, before decreasing at larger rapidity.

The measurements are extended to high rapidity in the electron channel up to |y ee | = 3.6 in the mass range 66 < m < 150 GeV. The analysis uses 20.2 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected in 2012 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The central rapidity measurement channels are combined taking into account the systematic uncertainty correlations. Their combination achieves an experimental precision of better than 0.5%, excluding the overall uncertainty in the luminosity measurement of 1.9%.",

The fiducial cross sections are compared to a theoretical prediction calculated using Powheg at NLO with matched leading-logarithm parton showers. The calculation is approximately corrected for NNLO QCD effects and for additional higher-order electroweak effects applied as a function of m . The single-and double-differential measurements are well described by the prediction. Having applied corrections to the scattering amplitude coefficients in Powheg the prediction also provides a good description of the triple-differential measurements.",
