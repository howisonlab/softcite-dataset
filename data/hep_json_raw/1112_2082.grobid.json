The analysis is performed as a function of the highest charged-particle transverse momentum p T,LT in the event. Different regions are defined with respect to the azimuthal direction of the leading (highest transverse momentum) track: Toward, Transverse and Away. The Toward and Away regions collect the fragmentation products of the hardest partonic interaction. The Transverse region is expected to be most sensitive to the Underlying Event activity. The study is performed with charged particles above three different p T thresholds: 0.15, 0.5 and 1.0 GeV/c. In the Transverse region we observe an increase in the multiplicity of a factor 2-3 between the lower and higher collision energies, depending on the track p T threshold considered. Data are compared to Pythia 6.4, Pythia 8.1 and Phojet. On average, all models considered underestimate the multiplicity and summed p T in the Transverse region by about 10-30%.",

            "text": "The detailed characterization of hadronic collisions is of great interest for the understanding of the underlying physics. The production of particles can be classified according to the energy scale of the process involved. At high transverse momentum transfers (p T 2 GeV/c) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) is the appropriate theoretical framework to describe partonic interactions. This approach can be used to quantify parton yields and correlations, whereas the transition from partons to hadrons is a non-perturbative process that has to be treated using phenomenological approaches. Moreover, the bulk of particles produced in high-energy hadronic collisions originate from low-momentum transfer processes. For momenta of the order of the QCD scale, O(100 MeV), a perturbative treatment is no longer feasible. Furthermore, at the center-of-mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at momentum transfers of a few GeV/c, the calculated QCD cross-sections for 2-to-2 parton scatterings exceed the total hadronic cross-section [1]. This result indicates that Multiple Partonic Interactions (MPI) occur in this regime. The overall event dynamics cannot be derived fully from first principles and must be modeled using phenomenological -1 -",

            "text": "In this paper, we present an analysis of the bulk particle production in pp collisions at the LHC by measuring the so-called Underlying Event (UE) activity [2]. The UE is defined as the sum of all the processes that build up the final hadronic state in a collision excluding the hardest leading order partonic interaction. This includes fragmentation of beam remnants, multiple parton interactions and initial-and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR) associated to each interaction. Ideally, we would like to study the correlation between the UE and perturbative QCD interactions by isolating the two leading partons with topological cuts and measuring the remaining event activity as a function of the transferred momentum scale (Q 2 ). Experimentally, one can identify the products of the hard scattering, usually the leading jet, and study the region azimuthally perpendicular to it as a function of the jet energy. Results of such an analysis have been published by the CDF [2][3][4][5] and STAR [6] collaborations for pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.8 and 0.2 TeV, respectively. Alternatively, the energy scale is given by the leading charged-particle transverse momentum, circumventing uncertainties related to the jet reconstruction procedure at low p T . It is clear that this is only an approximation to the original outgoing parton momentum, the exact relation depends on the details of the fragmentation mechanism. The same strategy based on the leading charged particle has recently been applied by the ATLAS [7] and CMS [8] collaborations.",

These provide different descriptions of the UE associated with high energy hadron collisions. A general strategy is to combine a perturbative QCD treatment of the hard scattering with a phenomenological approach to soft processes. This is the case for the two models used in our analysis: Pythia and Phojet. In Pythia the simulation starts with a hard LO QCD process of the type 2 \u2192 2. Multi-jet topologies are generated with the parton shower formalism and hadronization is implemented through the Lund string fragmentation model [13]. Each collision is characterized by a different impact parameter b. Small b values correspond to a large overlap of the two incoming hadrons and to an increased probability for MPIs. At small p T values color screening effects need to be taken into account. Therefore a cut-off p T,0 is introduced, which damps the QCD cross-section for p T p T,0 . This cut-off is one of the main tunable model parameters.",

Firstly, the sub-leading track will have a different transverse momentum than the leading one. We refer to this as leadingtrack p T bin migration. It has been verified with Monte Carlo that this effect is negligible due to the weak dependence of the final distributions on p T,LT . Secondly, the reconstructed leading track might have a significantly different orientation with respect to the real one, resulting in a rotation of the overall event topology.

Since the tracking inefficiency is quite small (about 20%) applying it on the reconstructed data a second time does not alter the results significantly. To verify this statement we compared our results with a two step procedure. In this case the inefficiency is applied two times on measured data, half of its value at a time.

Measured data have been corrected for detector related effects; in particular we applied a data-driven correction to account for the misidentification of the leading track. The fully corrected final distributions are compared with Pythia 6.4, Pythia 8 and Phojet, showing that pre-LHC tunes have difficulties describing the data. These results are an important ingredient in the required retuning of those generators.",

We find that the ratio between the distributions at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV in this region saturates at a value of about 2 for track p T > 0.5 GeV/c. The summed p T distribution rises slightly faster as a function of \u221a s than the number density distribution, indicating that the available energy tends to increase the particle's transverse momentum in addition to the multiplicity. This is in qualitative agreement with an increased relative contribution of hard processes to the Underlying Event with increasing \u221a s. Moreover, the average number of particles at large p T,LT in the Transverse region seems to scale logarithmically with the collision energy. In general our results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with measurements from other LHC experiments (ATLAS and CMS) and show similar trends to that of the Tevatron (CDF).",
