The vertical band corresponds to the D 1 (2420) \u2212 signal and the horizontal band corresponds to the D 1 (2420) + . The projection to the R M(D + ) axis (Fig. 2) consists of a prominent D 1 (2420) \u2212 peak and a corresponding broad bump. The contributions of D 1 (2420) + D \u2212 and \u03c8(3770)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the selected data are determined using fits to the R M(D + ) one-dimensional distribution. The shape of this distribution is described using templates obtained from the signal MC simulation. In order to perform a likelihood scan of the resonance parameters, we generate a series of D 1 (2420) + signal MC with different values of mass and width, and smear these template shapes with a Gaussian function to take into account the resolution difference between data and MC simulations. The width of the Gaussian function is fixed to the difference of resolution in R M(D + ) for the control sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + D \u2212 . The signal shape for the mode \u03c8(3770)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is obtained from the MC simulation, where the resonance parameters of the \u03c8(3770) are taken from the PDG [13]. The relativistic Breit-Wigner function [13] is used to model the resonance lineshape of the \u03c8(3770) and D 1 (2420) \u2212 . A simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the data samples is performed at three high luminosity energy points of E c.m. = 4358.3, 4415.6 and 4599.5 MeV, with the resonance parameters of the D 1 (2420) + in common for all fits. The shapes and magnitudes of the combinatorial backgrounds are fixed according to the sample of the sideband events in R M(D + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), while the magnitudes of the D 1 (2420) + D \u2212 and \u03c8(3770)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212are the free parameters of the fit. The sum of the fitting components is shown inFig. 2. We obtain the mass and width of the D 1 (2420) + to be (2427.2 \u00b1 1.0) MeV/c 2 and (23.2 \u00b1 2.3) MeV, respectively.

Some calculations indicate that the Y (4260) is possibly a D 1 (2420)D molecular state, while the Z c (4430) is possibly a D 1 (2420)D * molecular state [8-11]. Hence, more studies on the properties of the involved D 1 (2420), such as mass and width, are helpful to better understand the nature of these exotic candidate states. The lightest charmonium state above the DD threshold is the \u03c8(3770) resonance, which is considered to have the quantum numbers of 1 3 D 1 [12,13]. Its spin-triplet partner 1 3 D 2 candidate, X(3823), has been observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 MeV at BE-SIII [16]. More precise measurements at different energy points are desired, as it provides an important way to investigate the intrinsic nature of the Y (4360) and \u03c8(4415) by studying the transitions between these charmonium(-like) states, such as Y (4360) \u2192 \u03c8(3770)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c8(3770)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In this analysis, we study the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 D + D \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at the center-of-mass (c.m.) energies, E c.m. , from 4358.3 to 4599.5 MeV, as listed in Table 1. Compared to the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0D0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , this final state has the advantage of being free from D * intermediate states, which greatly simplifies the analysis. We reconstruct the D + via its high branching fraction decay K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and adopt a recoil-mass technique to identify the D \u2212 and related resonant states. Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, inclusion of charge conjugate mode is implied throughout the context. Clear signals of the D 1 (2420) + and \u03c8(3770) are extracted in this data",
