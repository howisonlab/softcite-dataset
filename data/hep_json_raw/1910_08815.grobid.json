The results are based on data collected using the CMS detector at the LHC during runs with a special low-pileup configuration. Three analysis techniques with different degrees of dependence on simulations are used to remove the non-Bose-Einstein background from the correlation functions. All three methods give consistent results. The measured lengths of homogeneity are studied as functions of particle multiplicity as well as average pair transverse momentum and mass. The results are compared with data from both CMS and ATLAS at \u221a s = 7 TeV, as well as with theoretical predictions.",

These techniques are employed to characterize the size of the emission region at the freeze-out stage of the evolving system. Such studies have been performed by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV [3,4], 2.36 TeV [3], 2.76 TeV [5] and 7 TeV [4,5]. In these analyses, the one-dimensional (1D) correlations were measured in terms of the invariant relative momentum q 2 inv = \u2212q \u00b5 q \u00b5 = \u2212(k 1 \u2212 k 2 ) 2 = m 2 inv \u2212 4m 2 \u03c0 where k i refers to the four-momentum of each particle of the pair. The pion mass (m \u03c0 ) is assumed for all of the charged particles, since pions constitute the majority of the produced hadrons. Multi-dimensional analyses of the correlation functions in pp, proton-lead (pPb), and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions were performed by CMS [5] to explore the size of the source in different directions. Similar studies were also performed by other -1 -",

In nucleus-nucleus collisions, such structures can be parameterized by a Fourier expansion, providing information about the initial collision geometry and its fluctuations. In hydrodynamic models, initial state anisotropies are propagated to the final state via ultrarelativistic inviscid fluid evolution up to the freeze-out stage of the system. Additional measurements employing high multiplicity (HM) events in pp and in pPb collisions at the LHC resulted in evidence of collective behavior [23,24] even in such small colliding systems. Altogether, these results indicate that events with high multiplicity produced in pp collisions exhibit some properties similar to those in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The origin of such phenomena in small systems is still under debate [25], and BEC studies supply complementary information to shed light onto the origin of the observed similarities.",

In particular, for events with a small number of particles, the relative non-BEC contribution is enhanced. On the other hand, events in the high multiplicity range in pp collisions are more likely than events with similar multiplicities in heavy ion collisions to be affected by multi-jets. Therefore, the importance of accurate removal of these background effects is enhanced for the correlations studied in the current investigation. To address this requirement, the analysis is performed with three techniques that differ from each other in their dependence on simulations.",

Fitted values of R inv and \u03bb are presented as functions of event multiplicity as well as average pair transverse momentum (k T = 1 2 | p T,1 + p T,2 |) and mass (m T = m 2 \u03c0 + k 2 T ). The results are also compared to both previous experimental data and to theoretical predictions. This paper is structured as follows: sections 2-4 describe the experimental setup, the datasets and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations employed in the analysis, and the event and track selections, respectively. The generation, correction, and fitting procedures for the correlation functions, and the systematic uncertainties in those procedures, are detailed in sections 5 and 6, respectively. Results are presented in section 7, including comparisons with results from pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and theoretical predictions, and the summary is given in section 8. Finally, appendix A gives additional details on the analysis techniques and appendix B describes the study of an anticorrelation that was previously seen at lower energies [4,5]. This anticorrelation is also investigated in pp collisions at 13 TeV over the broad multiplicity range covered by this analysis. In particular, the depth of the dip is nonzero for events with high multiplicity. A more detailed discussion is given in an appendix because this topic is outside the main physics thrust of this paper.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS detector is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL, |\u03b7| < 3), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL,|\u03b7| < 3), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, quartz-fiber Cherenkov hadron forward (HF) calorimeters (3 < |\u03b7| < 5) complement the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors on both sides of the interaction point. These HF calorimeters are azimuthally subdivided into 20 \u2022 modular wedges and further segmented to form 0.175\u00d70.175 (\u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6) \"towers\". A muon system located outside the solenoid and embedded in the steel flux-return yoke is used for the reconstruction and identification of muons up to |\u03b7| = 2.4. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules. For nonisolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90 (45-150) \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [27]. The BPTX (Beam Pickup for Timing for the eXperiments) devices are used to trigger the detector readout. They are located around the beam pipe at a distance of 175 m from the IP on either side, and are designed to provide precise information on the LHC bunch structure and timing of the incoming beams. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [28]. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [29].",

Opposite sign pairs (i.e. +\u2212 and denoted \"OS\"), within the same |\u03b7| and p T ranges, are used by two of the analysis methods for removing non-BEC contributions to the correlation functions. The distributions in terms of the relative momentum of the pair q inv are divided into bins of the reconstructed charged particle multiplicity, N offline trk , and of k T . Although no particle identification is used, the contamination by particles other than charged pions is expected to be small, since pions are the dominant hadron species in the sample. For instance, the ratio of kaons to pions is about 12%, and protons to pions is roughly 6% for 7 TeV pp collisions [38]; for pp collisions at 13 TeV [39], the ratios are 11-12% and 5-6%, respectively, depending on the track multiplicity range. The unidentified kaons and protons contaminate the correlation function mainly in the low-q region, where the BEC effect is stronger (the contribution of nonidentical particle pairs depletes the signal). This contamination may lead to a reduction of the intercept parameter \u03bb as shown in figure 6 of ref. [5] for pp collisions at 7 TeV, which compares analyses of the same data using correlation functions generated with pairs of identical charged pions or pairs of unidentified charged hadrons. In contrast, as also seen in figure 6 in ref.

This reference sample can be constructed in several ways, most commonly by mixing tracks from different JHEP03(2020)014 events, as in this analysis. The default reference sample (called \u03b7-mixing) is constructed by pairing SS tracks from different events using the same procedure as refs. [3,4]. Two events are mixed only if they have similar reconstructed charged particle multiplicity in each of three pseudorapidity ranges: \u22122.4 < \u03b7 < \u22120.8, \u22120.8 < \u03b7 < 0.8, and 0.8 < \u03b7 < 2.4. For determining this matching criterion, a weight is assigned to each track of the event, depending on the \u03b7 range in which it occurs, and these weights are summed for each event. Then, the events are ordered according to this sum and the mixing is done by selecting two adjacent events in the ordered list and pairing each track in one event with all of the tracks in the other one. After being combined in this way, both events are discarded and not included in other pairings.",

The DR correlation function is fitted using eq. (53) to obtain R inv and \u03bb. This procedure reduces any bias due to the construction of the reference sample, with the advantage of directly removing non-BEC effects remaining in the data SR.

Lower multiplicities and higher k T ranges have larger systematic uncertainties because the contamination from the jet fragmentation background is higher in those regions.",

For the DR and HCS methods, the intercept parameter \u03bb rapidly decreases for increasing multiplicities in the very small N tracks region, whereas for multiplicities 10, it shows an almost constant value with increasing N tracks . The systematic uncertainties are larger for \u03bb using the CS method, with the fit values of \u03bb fluctuating and decreasing at higher multiplicities. This happens because \u03bb is very sensitive to the background modeling (non-BEC effects), which leads to larger uncertainties associated with its determination.",

Compatibility tests among the three methods, based on the variations of the measured values, assume the experimental uncertainties are either fully uncorrelated or fully correlated. For the fully correlated, most conservative case, the results agree within two standard deviations for most of the bins investigated. For the CS method, larger deviations are observed for the \u03bb parameter and the associated systematic uncertainties are also larger. This parameter is particularly sensitive to the analysis procedure adopted to remove the non-Bose-Einstein effects present in the signal, as observed in ref. [5]. Therefore, when comparing to other energies and theoretical models, only the values found using the HCS method are shown. This technique is less sensitive to the MC tune than the DR method, mainly in the HM region, and has smaller systematic uncertainties than the CS method. The ratio of RMS over mean for the differences amongst the values of the radius fit parameters obtained with the three methods is adopted as the relative uncertainty due to the variation between techniques (here called \"intramethod variation\").",

In addition, the opposite-sign (+\u2212) reference sample adopted by ATLAS causes distortions in the same-sign (++, \u2212\u2212) correlation functions due to resonance contamination.

In particular, for R inv obtained by CMS [3] and ALICE [14], they claim that a linear function in (dN tracks /d\u03b7) 1/3 for dN tracks /d\u03b7 > 7.5, matched with a fifth degree polynomial for smaller dN tracks /d\u03b7 values, fits the data better than a single function of (dN tracks /d\u03b7) 1/3 over the entire range. The dN tracks /d\u03b7 values in ref. [59] are for spectra extrapolated to p T of zero and therefore correspond more closely to the right panel of figure 5. Although theoretical predictions based on hydrodynamics are not available for pp collisions at 13 TeV yet, expectations for qualitative trends can be found in the literature. A framework based on event-by-event (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics, found that the three components of the radius fit parameters continuously grow with N tracks 1/3 for pp collisions [51]. Calculations using a hydrokinetic model also show a linear growth of the lengths of homogeneity with N tracks 1/3 [52]. Such a continuous increase is consistent with the results shown in figure 6 and was also observed for different collision systems (CuCu, AuAu, PbPb, and pp) and energies (ranging from 62.4 GeV to 7 TeV) in figure 1 of ref.

A similar trend of increasing length of homogeneity with multiplicity based on the UrQMD microscopic model for several colliding nuclei at different energies and for pp collisions at 7 TeV is found in ref. [60]. Instead of the one-dimensional R inv used in the present analysis, which combines temporal and spatial information, figure 1 of ref. [60] shows the three-dimensional radius parameters R long (along the beam) as well as R out and R side (both in the plane transverse to the beam direction), as functions of the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity, (dN tracks /d\u03b7) 1/3 . Although the behavior of each radius component varies, a trend of increasing with multiplicity is seen for all colliding systems. In the case of pp collisions, both R long and R side show a clear increasing trend, whereas the R out values estimated by UrQMD show an almost flat behavior or a slight tendency to decrease with increasing multiplicity. The color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory predicts an increase of the interaction radius (resulting from the initial overlapping of the two protons) as a function of the rapidity density dN/dy [61]. This dependence is parametrized by a third order polynomial in terms of x = (dN/dy) 1/3 for x < 3.4; beyond this point, the radius tends to a constant value, the so-called \"saturation\" radius. In the case of pp collisions at 7 TeV, this can be expressed by [61] ",

(7.1) could be reliable is around dN/d\u03b7 \u223c 5 in cases where no p T cut is applied to the data. This condition is better illustrated by the right plot in figure 5, and considering that the \u03b7 coverage in CMS and ATLAS is about 4.8, this minimum value would correspond to N (p T >0.1) tracks \u223c 25. This prediction for the radius behavior is based on a calculation relating particle multiplicity to a saturation scale using computations of the interaction radius determined from the CGC [62]. The parameterization given in eq. (7.1) is compared with the results from the HCS method in the right panel of figure 6. The predictions from the CGC are well below the data and the predicted saturation radius [61,62] is almost half the size of that seen in the data. In ref. [62], no explicit calculation of the BEC radii (corresponding to emission after the last interaction) is performed. Instead, only the initial size of the pp interaction region and the initial energy density are used, without considering any fluid dynamic evolution, which may explain the underestimated values for the CGC radius parameter seen in figure 6. Since the CGC calculation does not include the evolution of the system, it is not unexpected that it underestimates the measured radii. However, the CGC dependence of the radii on particle density, consisting of a rise followed by saturation, is similar to the shape seen in the data. To illustrate this behavior, a linear plus constant function is fitted to the data using statistical uncertainties only (see the right panel of figure 6).",

Three analysis methods, each with a different dependence on Monte Carlo simulations, are used to generate correlation functions, which are found to give consistent results. One dimensional studies of the radius fit parameter, R inv , and the intercept parameter, \u03bb, have been carried out for both inclusive events and high multiplicity events selected using a -19 -JHEP03(2020)014 dedicated online trigger. For multiplicities in the range 0 < N offline trk < 250 and average pair transverse momentum 0 < k T < 1 GeV, values of the radius fit parameter and intercept are in the ranges 0.8 < R inv < 3.0 fm and 0.5 < \u03bb 1.0, respectively.",

            "text": "Over most of the multiplicity range studied, the value of R inv increases with increasing event multiplicities and is proportional to N tracks 1/3 , a trend which is predicted by hydrodynamical calculations. For events with more than \u223c100 charged particles, the observed dependence of R inv suggests a possible saturation, with the lengths of homogeneity also consistent with a constant value. Comparisons of the multiplicity dependence are made with predictions of the color glass condensate effective theory, by means of a parameterization of the radius of the system formed in pp collisions. The values of the radius parameters in the model are much lower than those in the data, although the general shape of the dependence on multiplicity is similar in both cases. The radius fit parameter R inv is also observed to decrease with increasing k T , a behavior that is consistent with emission from a system that is expanding prior to its decoupling. Inspired by hydrodynamic models, the dependence of R \u22122 inv on the average pair transverse mass was investigated and the two are observed to be proportional, a behavior similar to that seen in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The proportionality constant between R \u22122 inv and transverse mass can be related to the flow parameter of a Hubble-type expansion of the system. For pp collisions at 13 TeV, this expansion is slower for larger event multiplicity, a dependence that was also found in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Therefore, the present analysis reveals additional similarities between the systems produced in high multiplicity pp collisions and those found using data for larger initial systems. These results may provide additional constraints on future attempts using hydrodynamical models and/or the color glass condensate framework to explain the entire range of similarities between pp and heavy ion interactions.",

The DR method was used in refs. [3][4][5] to reduce the bias due to the construction of the reference sample. The DR technique also has the advantage of reducing the non-BEC background that could remain in the SR (i.e., correlations coming from resonance decays and from energy-momentum conservation are not included in the reference sample, which is constructed with the event mixing technique adopted throughout this analysis). Therefore, by selecting a MC simulation that describes well the general properties of the data, those residual correlations can, in principle, be removed by taking the DRs with an SR defined similarly in MC events from non-BEC contributions [68,69]).",

Prior to its observation in pp collisions, this anticorrelation had been seen in e + e \u2212 collisions [69], with features compatible with a description provided by the \u03c4 -model [70], in which particle production has a broad distribution in proper time and the phase space distribution of the emitted particles is dominated by strong correlations of the spacetime coordinate and momentum components.

(53), and the value of the curve corresponding to the \u03c4 -model fit at its minimum (details can be found in ref. [5]). The corresponding results are shown in figure 11. The plot on the left shows the variation of \u2206 as a function of N tracks , for integrated values of k T . The depth of the dip decreases with multiplicity and suggest an approach to a constant value above N tracks \u223c 120. The behavior of the depth is shown as a function of k T in the right plot, for several N offline trk bins. In the lowest multiplicity bin, a clear decrease with k T is seen, but the slope decreases as JHEP03 (2020)014N offline trk increases. The results for 60 < N offline trk < 80 show a weak k T dependence and the values of \u2206 are almost constant for 80 < N offline trk < 140. The fact that the depth of the dip, although small, seems to tend to a constant value different from zero at the highest measured multiplicities raises the question of this effect being a consequence of the DR method or an intrinsic characteristic of the collision system that could keep memory of its initially small size, even at the highest track multiplicities produced so far in pp collisions.",
