The scheme makes use of amplitude models recently reported by the LHCb collaboration. Assuming that a four-bin scheme optimised on the models retains a similar sensitivity when applied in data, it is estimated that the statistical uncertainty on \u03b3 from the B-meson sample so far collected by the LHCb experiment will be as low as 5 degrees. This will be one of the most precise results available for any single decay mode in a B \u2212 \u2192 D K \u2212 measurement. Quantum-correlated DD data accumulated by the CLEO-c experiment are analysed to provide first constraints on the coherence factors and average strong-phase differences in the four bins, which are necessary inputs for the measurement. These constraints are compared with the predictions of the model, and consequences for the measurement of \u03b3 are discussed.",

The integration over the phase space of the D decay dilutes the quantum interference, which is manifested in the fact that the coherence factor is much smaller than unity. A more attractive approach is to perform the analysis in disjoint bins of phase space. In this case the parameters of Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) are re-defined within each bin. A given bin, if suitably chosen, can possess greater coherence and therefore exhibit enhanced interference effects than the integral over all phase space. In addition to improving the intrinsic sensitivity, this strategy also has the benefit of breaking degeneracies that exist in the inclusive analysis, thus enabling a single solution to be obtained from the data in the physical region of the Unitarity Triangle plane.",

[17], which reports amplitude models for both final states. The largest contributions to each decay mode are found to be via external W -emissions, manifesting themselves as the axial meson a 1 (1260) \u2212 in the favoured mode and the axial kaons K 1 (1270) + and K 1 (1400) + in the suppressed mode. Large contributions are also found in both decay modes from vector-vector, e.g. K * (892) 0 \u03c1(770) 0 , and scalar-scalar amplitudes. The values of the average strong-phase differences and coherence factors in local regions of phase space, as predicted by the model, are found to have small variations with respect to the choice of model components and parameters. Depending on the region of phase space considered, the predicted strong-phase differences and coherence factors are found to vary within a range of [1 \u2022 , 7 \u2022 ] and [0.005, 0.030], respectively.

The histograms in the latter plot are normalised such that the yield summed over the B-meson charges corresponds to about 600 candidates, which is approximately the size of the signal sample that can be reconstructed in the full LHCb Run 1 and Run 2 sample of 9 fb \u22121 , estimated by scaling the yields reported in the 3 fb \u22121 Run 1 analysis [13] and accounting for the change in b-production crosssection between Runs 1 and 2. In order to arrive at a sensitive binning scheme, the bins should be well separated in average strong-phase difference, which is achieved by dividing the phase space with a one-dimensional binning in the normalised strong-phase difference. This choice also results in bins with higher coherence than integrating over the phase space, which further improves the sensitivity. Similar considerations apply when choosing a binning scheme for the self conjugate [19,20]. In order for each bin to have a similar weight in the analysis, and therefore benefit the overall precision, it is also necessary to distribute approximately equally the expected number of CP-averaged decays in each bin. Therefore, it is required that the different bins have an equal product of the CF and DCS phase-space averaged amplitude integrals:",

From Table 1, and the contours in Fig. 3, it can be seen that bins 1 to 3 show reasonable compatibility between the measurements and the predictions, but the agreement is less satisfactory in bin 4. In order to assess the probability of such a configuration of results, under the assumption that the model correctly describes nature, an ensemble of simulated data sets is generated and fitted. This exercise returns a p-value of 6%. If future studies reveal that the true value of the global phase difference is somewhat higher than the central value measured in Ref.

For example, a value of 180 \u2022 , which lies within Table 1 Predicted and measured values of the coherence factors and strong-phase differences in four bins of phase space.

The uncertainty on \u03b3 associated with the finite size of the CLEO-c data set is estimated to be around 4. uncertainty to be halved, which would make it sub-dominant for the LHCb Run 1 and 2 data sets, even for the case of the hadronic parameters taking the values predicted by the model.

By making use of amplitude models of the D decays recently reported by the LHCb collaboration [17], it is possible to define bins in phase space that have high coherence, which will in turn allow for significantly increased sensitivity to \u03b3 . Assuming that a four-bin scheme optimised on the models has similar sensitivity when applied in data, and with perfect knowledge of the hadronic parameters of the D decays, it is estimated that an uncertainty of around 5 \u2022 will be attainable with the B-meson data set currently available at LHCb.

[10], are convenient for conveying information about the doubletag yields involving the CP and the like-signed-kaon tags. Any deviation of K 3\u03c0 CP from zero, or the \u03c1 K 3\u03c0 K \u03c0 (\u03c0 0 ),LS observables from one, is indicative of a non-zero coherence factor. These quantities are given here for the current analysis. In the fit presented in this Letter, however, it is the yields for these double tags that are used as input, due to the limitations of using the normal approximation of uncertainties for such small numbers of candidates. The measured values in each of the four bins defined in this paper are given in Table 2, and the correlation matrix for these measurements is shown in Table 3. Similarly, the 10 \u03c1 K 3\u03c0 L S observables in the four-by-four bins for the self tags are given in Table 4. The correlations between the results in these bins is negligible.
