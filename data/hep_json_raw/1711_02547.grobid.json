The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. The measurement is performed in the same-sign dilepton, three-and four-lepton final states. The production cross sections are measured to be \u03c3(ttW) = 0.77 +0.12   \u22120.11 (stat) +0.13 \u22120.12 (syst) pb and \u03c3(ttZ) = 0.99 +0.09 \u22120.08 (stat) +0.12 \u22120.10 (syst) pb. The expected (observed) signal significance for the ttW production in same-sign dilepton channel is found to be 4.5 (5.3) standard deviations, while for the ttZ production in threeand four-lepton channels both the expected and the observed significances are found to be in excess of 5 standard deviations. The results are in agreement with the standard model predictions and are used to constrain the Wilson coefficients for eight dimension-six operators describing new interactions that would modify ttW and ttZ production.",

This, coupled with the higher integrated luminosity collected at 13 TeV collisions, allows for a much more accurate study of these processes. Precise measurements of the production cross section for ttW and ttZ are of particular interest because these topologies can receive sizeable contributions from new physics (NP) beyond the standard model (SM) [2,3]. Furthermore, these processes form dominant backgrounds to several JHEP08(2018)011 Figure 1. Representative leading-order Feynman diagrams for ttW and ttZ production at the LHC.",

The contribution from \u03c4 leptons are included through their decays to electrons and muons. The analysis is performed in three exclusive final states, in which events with two leptons of same charge, denoted as same-sign (SS) dileptons, are used to extract the ttW signal, while events with three or four charged leptons that include a lepton pair of opposite charge and same flavor (OSSF) are used to measure the ttZ signal yield. In addition to the individual ttW and ttZ cross section measurements, a fit is performed in all three final states to simultaneously extract these cross sections. Furthermore, the results are interpreted in the context of an effective field theory to constrain the Wilson coefficients [9], which parameterize the strength of new physics interactions, for a set of selected dimension-six operators that might signal the presence of NP contributions in ttW and ttZ production.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel magnetic flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [10]. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [11]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events, while the second level selects events by running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing on a farm of computer processors.",

The selection efficiencies for the signal and background events that pass all requirements are found to be greater than 95 and 98% for the dilepton analysis and for the three-and four-lepton analyses, respectively. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to estimate some of the backgrounds, as well as to calculate the selection efficiencies for the ttZ and ttW signal events. The simulated events for the W\u03b3 * , WW, tWZ, and for pairs of top quarks associated with a pair of bosons (ttVV, where V = W, Z, or H) processes, are performed at leading order (LO) in QCD, and for ttZ, ttW, tZq, tHq, tHW, WZ, WWZ, WZZ, ZZZ, tt\u03b3 * , and Z\u03b3 * final states at NLO in QCD using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2. 2.2 or v2.3.3 [12]. The NLO powheg v2 [13] generator is used for the production of the ttH [14] and qq\u2192 ZZ [15,16] processes, while the gg \u2192 ZZ process is generated at LO in QCD with mcfm v7.0 [17]. The simulated samples of ZZ events are scaled to the cross sections calculated at next-tonext-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD for qq \u2192 ZZ [18] (using a scaling K factor of 1.1) and for gg \u2192 ZZ at NLO [19] (using K = 1.7). The NNPDF3.0LO [20] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for the simulation generated at LO and the NNPDF3.0NLO [20] PDF for those generated at NLO. Parton showering, hadronization, and the underlying event are simulated using pythia v8.212 [21,22] with the CUETP8M1 tune [23,24]. The double counting of the partons generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo and those with pythia is removed using the MLM [25] and the FxFx [26] matching schemes, in the LO and NLO generated events, respectively. All events are processed through a simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4 [27] and are reconstructed with the same algorithms as used for data. Simultaneous pp collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings, referred to as pileup (PU), are also simulated. The PU distribution used in simulation is chosen to match the one observed in the data.",

A relative isolation parameter, I rel , is determined by a cone-based algorithm. For each electron (muon) candidate, a cone of \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.3 (0.4) is constructed around the track direction at the event primary vertex, where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 are the respective differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle (in radians) relative to the lepton track. The scalar sum of the p T of all PF particles within this cone is calculated, excluding the lepton candidate and any charged particle not originating from the selected primary vertex. Exclusion of such particles removes the PU contribution from the charged particles, and a correction is therefore still required for the neutral component. The average energy density deposited by neutral particles in the event, computed with the FastJet [30,31] program, is therefore subtracted from the neutral component to the sum of the p T of particles in the cone. The quantity I rel is then defined as the ratio of this corrected sum to the p T of the lepton candidate. An electron candidate is selected if I rel < 0.1 for all three analyses, while a muon candidate is selected if I rel < 0.25 for the three-and four-lepton analyses, and if I rel < 0.15 for the SS dilepton analysis. Consistency of the origination of the lepton from the primary vertex is enforced by requiring lepton transverse and longitudinal displacements from the primary vertex to be less than 0.05 and 0.1 cm, respectively. Additionally, the transverse impact parameter is required to be smaller than 4 standard deviations, where the impact parameter is the minimum spatial distance between the lepton trajectory and the primary vertex.",

The main backgrounds to this analysis originate from misreconstruction effects: misidentification of leptons from heavy-quark decays, hereafter called nonprompt leptons to distinguish them from prompt leptons originating from W and Z boson decays, and mismeasurement of the charge of one of the leptons in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair.",

In order to distinguish these backgrounds from the signal, a multivariate analysis (MVA) has been developed. The MVA has been trained using the ttW signal and the main background process, using events with at least two jets, one or more of which are identified as b jets. Among the observables examined as inputs to the MVA training, the following are found to provide the best discrimination between the signal and background: the number of jets, N j , the number of b jets, N b , the scalar sum of p T of the jets, H T , p miss T , the highest-p T (leading) and the lowest-p T (trailing) lepton p T , the invariant mass calculated using p miss T and p T of each lepton, M T , the leading and next-to-highest-p T (subleading) jet p T , and the separation \u2206R between the trailing lepton and the nearest selected jet.",

Nonetheless, a residual background from such leptons leaks into the analysis selection. Such backgrounds are mainly expected from tt production, in which one or two of the leptons originate from the leptonic W boson decays and an additional nonprompt lepton comes from the semileptonic decays of a b hadron, as well as from Z \u2192 events containing an additional misidentified lepton. These backgrounds are estimated using a data-based technique. From a control sample in data, we calculate the probability for a loosely identified nonprompt lepton to pass the full set of tight requirements, designated as the tight-to-loose ratio. For loose leptons we choose a relaxed isolation requirement, I rel < 1, and additional electron identification requirements on the variables that distinguish prompt electrons from hadrons and photons which are misidentified as electrons. The tight-to-loose ratios are measured in a data control sample of QCD multijet events that are enriched in nonprompt leptons. This control sample consists of events with a single lepton and at least one jet, where the lepton and jets are separated by \u2206R > 1. We suppress -8 -JHEP08 (2018)011the prompt lepton contamination, mostly from W+jets, by requiring p miss T < 20 GeV and M T < 20 GeV, where M T is the transverse mass constructed using p miss T and the selected lepton. The residual prompt lepton contamination is subtracted using estimates from MC simulation. This subtraction is relevant only for the high-p T leptons, and its effect on the total estimated background does not exceed a few percent. These tight-to-loose ratios are parametrized as functions of the \u03b7 of the leptons and p cor T , with the latter calculated through corrections to lepton p T as a function of the energy in the isolation cone. This definition has no impact on the p T of the leptons that pass the isolation requirement, but modifies the p T of those that fail, and extract thereby a more accurate value of true p T [37]. The tight-to-loose ratios are then used together with the observed number of events in sideband regions. These sideband regions contain events that pass full event criteria in each analysis region, except that at least one of the leptons passes the loose selection but does not pass the tight selection. Each event in this region is assigned a weight as a function of the p T and \u03b7 of the loose lepton to account for the probability of the lepton to pass the tight selection.",

The tight-to-loose ratios are first measured for electrons and muons in simulated multijet events, and applied in simulated tt and Z+jets events in the same way as in data, to extract predictions for the nonprompt background contribution. These predictions agree very well with the observed yields in simulation, not only for the integral yields, but also for distributions in all kinematic variables used to form the analysis regions, including the boosted decision tree output D. Additionally, data control regions used in the signal-extraction regions and enriched in processes with nonprompt leptons, are formed to check any other potential sources of mismodeling. For the SS dilepton channel, we use the region with D < 0. Figure 4 shows the predicted background and observed data yields versus N j and the p T of the trailing lepton. Events in this region are also used in the signal extraction procedure for ttW. The potential systematic effects for the extrapolation from D < 0 to D > 0 are studied in simulation and found to be negligible compared to other sources of uncertainty. For the three-lepton channel this control region is defined by either the absence of an OSSF lepton pair, or by the presence of an OSSF, with its invariant mass being at least 10 GeV away from M (Z), and with at least one b jet present. This region is dominated by tt events in which both W bosons decay leptonically and an additional nonprompt lepton is present. Figure 5 shows the predicted and observed yields versus the flavor of the leptons, p miss T , N j , and N b .

The events are selected following the first four steps mentioned in section 4.2, in the given selection sequence, requiring two OSSF lepton pairs with an invariant mass within a 20 GeV window of M (Z). The distributions of the expected and observed data yields in this ZZ enriched control region are shown in figure 7. The ZZ control region, which is better than 95% pure in ZZ events, shows good agreement between data and simulation in events with extra jets. Based on this study in the four-lepton control region, as well as considering the studies done for the WZ background at high jet multiplicities, we assign a 20% systematic uncertainty. Additional experimental uncertainties, as previously described for the t(t)X and WZ backgrounds, are also applied to the ZZ background.",

The trigger efficiencies measured in simulation agree within 1% with the measurements in data, with an exception of the SS dimuon channel, in which the difference reaches 3%. The event yields in simulation are therefore scaled to match the trigger efficiencies in data. The systematic uncertainty due to this scaling is 2-4% depending on the channel.  Reconstructed lepton selection efficiencies are measured using a \"tag-and-probe\" method [43,44] in bins of lepton p T and \u03b7, and are higher than 65 (96)% for electrons (muons). These measurements are performed separately in data and in simulation. The differences between these two measurements are typically around 1-4% per lepton, which corresponds to 3-7% for all leptons in the event.

For the signal and backgrounds modelled through simulation, the resulting uncertainty is determined by the observed differences in yields with and without the shift in jet energies. The same technique is used to calculate the uncertainties caused by the jet energy resolution, for which the uncertainty is found to be 1-6%. These uncertainties are also propagated in the p miss T variable, and the resulting uncertainty in signal selection is found to be around 1%. The b tagging efficiency in the simulation is corrected using scale factors determined from data [33,34].

The summary of the expected and observed signal significances for each of these processes is given in table 6. We find an expected (observed) signal significance of 4.5 (5.3) standard deviations in the SS dilepton channel, and 4.7 (4.5) standard deviations in the four-lepton channel, while in three-lepton channel both the expected and the observed significances are found to be much larger than 5 standard deviations. The expected (observed) signal significances for ttW + and ttW \u2212 processes are calculated as well, being 4.2 (5.5) and 2.4 (2.3), respectively. The measured signal strength parameters are found to be 1.23 +0.19 \u22120.18 (stat) +0.20 \u22120.18 (syst) +0.13 \u22120.12 (theo) for ttW, and 1.17 +0.11 \u22120.10 (stat) +0.14 \u22120.12 (syst) +0.11 \u22120.12 (theo) for ttZ.

Because ttH is sizeable background to ttW, and the NP effects on ttH are considered as well, as they cannot be disentangled from NP effects on ttW. The range of Wilson coefficient values to study is chosen such that |c i | < (4\u03c0) 2 [61]. The dimension-six operators are encoded using the FeynRules [62] implementation from ref. [53], and we follow their notation and operator-naming scheme throughout this work. This implementation assumes flavor-independent fermion couplings. Because the W and Z boson couplings to light quarks are highly constrained by other measurements, i.e. inclusive W or Z cross section measurements, we removed all NP couplings to the first two generations. This modified implementation is used in Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo [63] to evaluate the cross section \u03c3 SM+NP expected due to both SM and NP effects at LO, with no constraints on the number of allowed QCD or electroweak vertices, for 30 values of c i , with all other couplings set to their SM values. We then fit those points with a quadratic function (see eq. (8.3)) to determine \u03c3 SM+NP (c i ).  Figure 13.

The analysis is performed in the same-sign dilepton final state for ttW, and the three-and four-lepton final states for ttZ, and these three final states are used to extract the cross sections for ttW and ttZ production. For both processes the observed signal significance exceeds 5 standard deviations. The measured signal strength parameters are 1.23 +0.19 \u22120.18 (stat) +0.20 \u22120.18 (syst) +0.13 \u22120.12 (theo) and 1.17 +0.11 \u22120.10 (stat) +0.14 \u22120.12 (syst) +0.11 \u22120.12 (theo) for ttW and ttZ, respectively. The measured cross sections are \u03c3(ttW) = 0.77 +0.12 \u22120.11 (stat) +0.13 \u22120.12 (syst) pb and \u03c3(ttZ) = 0.99 +0.09 \u22120.08 (stat) +0.12 \u22120.10 (syst) pb, in agreement with the standard model predictions. These results have been used to set constraints on the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators. Eight operators have been identified which are of particular interest because they change the expected cross sections of ttZ, ttW, or ttH without significantly impacting expected background yields. Both ttZ and ttH are affected by O 3G , O 3G , O 2G , and O uB . Only ttZ is affected by O Hu , while O H affects only ttH. All three processes ttZ, ttW, and ttH are affected by O uG and O uW . In cases where new physics beyond the standard model modifies the expected ttZ cross section, the sensitivity is mainly determined by ttZ and the fit is able to match the observed excess in data. No operators were identified which provide an independent handle on ttW. The constraints presented, obtained by considering one operator at a time, are a useful first step toward more global approaches.",
