Such couplings directly result from the nonabelian SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge symmetry of the SM. In the SM, the values of the couplings are fully determined by the structure of the Lagrangian; any deviation of the observed diboson production strength from the SM prediction, typically manifested as a change in the cross section, would indicate new physics. The expected change would lead to an overall increase JHEP04(2019)122 Figure 1.

Furthermore, WZ production is a major background to searches for new physics in multilepton final states; a precise determination of its cross section is crucial to improve the sensitivity of these searches. In addition, initial state radiation can be used as a probe of the boost of the WZ system through a differential study of the leading jet transverse momentum, since an initial state particle can radiate a jet and this jet will recoil against the WZ system.",

The most relevant of these results to this paper is the CMS analysis reporting the pp \u2192 WZ production cross section at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV as well as a search for anomalous TGCs (aTGCs) at \u221a s = 8 TeV in the multilepton final state using the full 2011 and 2012 data sets [15]. The ATLAS Collaboration has similarly analyzed the full 8 TeV data set [7], measured the inclusive and differential cross section, and set limits on aTGCs. The inclusive pp \u2192 WZ production cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV was measured in the multilepton final state by the ATLAS [8] and CMS [14] Collaborations, using the full 2015 data set. This paper presents a new analysis of pp \u2192 WZ production at \u221a s = 13 TeV using multilepton final states in which the Z boson decays into a pair of electrons or muons, and the W boson decays into a neutrino and either an electron or a muon. Compared to the previous results, the inclusive and differential cross sections are measured with increased precision (the overall uncertainty in the inclusive cross section is reduced by half), and more stringent confidence intervals on aTGCs are set, yielding the current best limits in two of the parameters.",

The modelling of the aTGCs JHEP04 (2019)122is done by applying the matrix element reweighting method [24] at LO accuracy to a signal sample generated with the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.3.3 generator [21] at NLO accuracy.

An identification algorithm, based on a multivariate analysis (MVA) using boosted decision trees (BDTs), is trained to discriminate signal leptons (from W and Z decays) from background leptons (mostly b hadron decays). The resulting classifier is referred to as the lepton MVA discriminator, and was trained using a sample of ttZ events: signal leptons originate from leptonic ttZ decays, and background leptons originate mostly from b hadron decays. Further details on the lepton MVA discriminator can be found in refs. [37,38]. The efficiencies have a high dependence on the lepton p T and \u03b7; typical values for electrons are 3-7% misidentification efficiency and 20/40/80/90% identification efficiency for low p T electrons in the endcap, low p T electrons in the barrel, high p T electrons in the endcap, and high p T electrons in the barrel, respectively. For muons, typical values are 2-10% misidentification efficiency and 80-100% identification efficiencies where higher values correspond to higher p T muons.

Charged hadrons not originating from the primary vertex are subtracted from the PF candidates considered in the clustering; this procedure is referred to as charged-hadron subtraction. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average, and are applied to the energy of the jet as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z +jet, and multijet events are used to correct for any residual differences in jet energy scale between data and simulation [42]. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [43].

The baseline selection is split, on the basis of the flavour composition of the leptonic triplet, into four categories denoted as: eee, ee\u00b5, e\u00b5\u00b5, and \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5. The signal region (SR) is defined by applying to the baseline selection additional requirements that are designed to increase the purity of the region by reducing specific background contributions. Consistency with the Z boson mass peak is enforced by requiring the invariant mass of the two leptons assigned to the Z boson to be close to m Z , |M ( Z1 Z2 ) \u2212 m Z | < 15 GeV. This requirement greatly reduces the contribution from nonresonant multilepton production processes such as tt production. A requirement that p miss T > 30 GeV is found to greatly reduce the Z+jets background contribution; in the following, residual events are included in the contribution labelled nonprompt. A large reduction in the number of events that include both a tt pair and a Z boson is obtained by rejecting events that contain one or more b-tagged jets. The invariant mass of the trilepton system M ( Z1 Z2 W ) is required to exceed 100 GeV. Finally, contributions from tetraleptonic decays in ZZ events are reduced by rejecting any event with an additional fourth lepton that passes a looser lepton selection. Generator-level requirements for the signal, designed to avoid infrared divergences, are matched at reconstruction level by vetoing events that do not contain a lepton pair passing a minimum invariant mass requirement of M ( ) > 4 GeV. This requirement also has the desirable effect of reducing the contribution from low-mass resonance processes.

Prompt background sources consist of the SM processes where the leptons originate in the decay of an SM boson or \u03c4 lepton; the nonprompt backgrounds consist of SM processes where the leptons originate in the decay of b hadrons. The nonprompt background contributions are heavily dominated by Z+jets production, with additional contributions from dileptonic tt decays. The total contribution of these processes to the signal region is estimated using the tight-to-loose method described in detail in ref. [40]. The probability for a loose lepton to pass the tight criteria is measured in a single-lepton+jets signal region enriched in nonprompt leptons. For each specific selection, an application region is defined starting from the same requirements and additionally requesting that at least one of the leptons passes the loose selection but fails the tight selection. Depending on the p T , |\u03b7|, and multiplicity of the failing leptons, the extrapolation from the control region to the application region is derived for each event as a transfer factor, based on the previously measured probability. The contamination of the application region due to the prompt contribution is estimated from simulation and its effect is subtracted from the total nonprompt estimation in the selection, using the same transfer factors. Uncertainties in the determination of the nonprompt contribution are estimated with simulated events by comparing the prediction of the method and the one derived directly from simulation; they are found to be dominated by the statistical uncertainty due to the limited amount of simulated events, and estimated to be about 30%. An additional source of systematic uncertainty is estimated to range between 5 and 30% from the differences observed amongst a number of methods used for the subtraction of the prompt background processes in the signal region.",

Since electron and muon identification efficiencies are computed separately, the uncertainty in their estimate is split by flavour and evaluated separately. The largest effects are in the eee category for the electron efficiency (about 5%) and in the \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5 category for the muon efficiency (about 3%). The uncertainty in the energy scale of the leptons is estimated to produce a variation of 1% in their p T ; the reconstructed muon p T is computed with a different method for high-p T muons (above 200 GeV), thus a conservative 5% uncertainty is assigned to each high-p T muon. The uncertainty in the lepton energy scale is assigned to each lepton -separately for electrons and muons -and propagated to the yields, with effects smaller than 1% in most cases.",

The uncertainties described in section 7 are included as additional nuisance parameters correlated across the bins. Confidence regions for each parameter and each combination of two parameters are derived using a multidimensional likelihood fit to the relevant parameters, with the remaining ones set to the SM values. Nuisance parameters are profiled in the likelihood fit. Appropriate confidence levels (CL s ) are derived assuming the distribution of the loglikelihood function is half a \u03c7 2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of free parameters. The full procedure is applied to derive one-dimensional confidence intervals in each of the anomalous couplings parameters, fixing the other two parameters to zero -the SM value. The results are shown in table 13. For each pair of parameters, a two-dimensional confidence region is derived, as shown in figure 16.",
