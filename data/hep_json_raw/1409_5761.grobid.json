            "text": "Despite considerable efforts over the last decades, hadron formation, which is part of the nonperturbative sector of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), remains poorly understood within the standard model of particle physics. Heavy-quarkonium production is an excellent probe of hadron formation. In the past years, significant progress has been made in the theory sector [1], especially in the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) [2]. This framework factorizes into distinct processes the short-distance creation of a heavy quark-antiquark pair, in either a color-singlet or a coloroctet configuration, and the long-distance formation of the quarkonium bound-state. The first process is presently calculated to nextto-leading order in perturbative QCD [3]. The bound-state formation is described by transition probabilities, called long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs), which are assumed to be constant (independent of quarkonium transverse momentum and rapidity) and universal (independent of the collision system and energy). In the Fock-state expansion of the heavy-quarkonium state, only a small number of color-singlet and color-octet terms contribute in the limit of small relative quark velocity v. The color-octet LDMEs are E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. not easily calculable and the dominant ones are, therefore, treated as free parameters and adjusted to agree with the experimental data [4][5][6].",

            "text": "The ratio of P-wave quarkonia production cross sections is a reliable test of predictions because many theoretical, as well as experimental, uncertainties cancel out. Prompt \u03c7 c measurements in hadron collisions were not possible until the advent of precise vertex detectors that allowed the separation of promptly produced \u03c7 c from those coming from the decay of B mesons [7]. This ability is important, as NRQCD predictions are valid only for promptly produced \u03c7 c . In the case of bottomonium, measurements are more difficult owing to the reduced production cross sections and the small separation in mass (19.4 MeV) between the \u03c7 b1 (1P) and the \u03c7 b2 (1P) (for readability the 1P is dropped hereafter). The production ratio of \u03c7 c2 and \u03c7 c1 is discussed in recent theoretical papers [3,8], but the debate on the importance of color-octet contributions remains open. In the bottomonium sector, the NRQCD velocity expansion is more rigorously valid given the smaller relative quark velocity. Therefore, the measurement of the \u03c7 b2 to \u03c7 b1 production cross section ratio should give further insight into the mechanism that governs quarkonium production [8]. At the LHC, the charmonium \u03c7 c2 /\u03c7 c1 production cross section ratio was measured by the experiment also reported a measurement of the \u03c7 b1 and \u03c7 b2 production cross section ratio using combined \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data [12].",

To reduce CPU usage, the \u03c7 b mesons were generated alone, without any \"underlying event\". This simplification should have no influence on the results of the analysis because any possible effect of accompanying particles on the track reconstruction efficiencies is identical for the two \u03c7 b states, canceling in the ratio.

Since the lowmass tail of the \u03c7 b2 shape falls under the \u03c7 b1 peak, it is important to use a reliable parameterization of the resolution function when evaluating the ratio of the \u03c7 b2 and \u03c7 b1 yields, N \u03c7 b2 /N \u03c7 b1 . The \u03c7 b mass resolution is dominated by the energy resolution of the converted photon and has a clear low-mass tail, typical of processes involving radiative losses (the electrons and positrons lose energy when traversing the tracker material). The simulated signal shape also reveals the presence of a small high-mass tail due to multiple scattering; the signal response is parameterized by a double-sided Crystal Ball (CB) function [21] consisting of a Gaussian core with two power-law tails, with independent exponents and transition points.",
