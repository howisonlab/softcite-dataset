Recently, it has been shown that non-thermally produced vector bosons (sometimes called hidden photons) related to a broken U(1) gauge symmetry are among the possible WISP (weakly interacting slim particles) dark matter candidates. The WISP Dark Matter eXperiment (WISPDMX) is the first direct hidden photon dark matter search experiment probing the particle masses within the 0.8 \u00b5eV-2.07 \u00b5eV range with four resonant modes of a tunable radio frequency cavity and down to 0.4 neV outside of resonance. In this paper, we present the results from the first science run of WISPDMX comprising 22 000 broadband spectra with a 500 MHz bandwidth and a 50 Hz spectral resolution, obtained during 10-second integrations made at each individual tuning step of the measurements. No plausible dark matter candidate signal is found, both in the individual spectra reaching minimum detectable power of 8 \u00d7 10 \u221219 W and in the averaged spectrum of all the measurements with the minimum detectable power of 5 \u00d7 10 \u221222 W) attained for a total of 61 h of data taking. Using these spectra, we derive upper limits on the coupling constant of the hidden photon at the levels of 10 \u221213 for the resonant frequency ranges and 10 \u221212 for broadband mass range 0.2 \u00b5eV-2.07 \u00b5eV, and steadily increasing at masses below 0.2 \u00b5eV.",

Apart from the well-recognized shortcomings of the model such as the apparently arbitrary choice of parameters and issues related to naturalness [1], the SM fails to provide a viable explanation for dark matter and spectacularly over-predicts dark energy, which are the two dominating components of the \u039bCDM (cosmological constant \u039b, cold dark matter) standard model of cosmology (for some non-standard insights to the \u039bCDM model, see [2]). In many extensions of the standard model, a hidden (or dark) sector is introduced to provide an explanation for the missing components observed in our universe (without violating other bounds). The hidden sector is minimally coupled via gravity to the common forms of matter; additional mediators include the so-called Hidden Photons (HPs), an Abelian boson uncharged under the Standard Model (SM) fields of the visible sector [3,4]. Hidden photons can be produced during inflation, avoiding thermalization and providing a relic abundance which is consistent with the estimated dark matter density in the Universe [5][6][7]. The hidden vector boson mixes kinetically with the SM photon providing a weak coupling [8,9]. The corresponding Lagrangian (natural units with = c = 1 are used) is given by",

In this case, the fractional bandwidth of an individual measurement is inversely proportional to the signal enhancement which typically exceeds a factor of 10 4 . For such experiments to cover a sizable range of particle mass, the cavity must be tuned, and a larger number of independent, narrow band measurements must be made. The WISP Dark Matter eXperiment (WISPDMX) described here expands this conceptual approach by using a tunable large-volume cavity and a broadband recording apparatus with a total bandwidth of 500 MHz (2.07 \u00b5eV) and a frequency resolution of 50 Hz (0.21 peV). This setup makes it possible to combine a set of tunable resonant measurements made simultaneously at four different cavity modes with out-of-resonance measurements made essentially over the entire 500 MHz frequency range.",

The reference frequency can drift over time and with changing temperature conditions. The temperature in the laboratory changes by as much as 2 \u2022 C. The spectrum analyzer was calibrated by the manufacturer in December 2016, and the frequency measured with the spectrum analyzer has a systematic uncertainty at the level of 10 2 Hz, taking into account that for the Rohde-Schwarz FSP 7, the relative aging rate\u03bd = 10 \u22126 yr \u22121 and the relative frequency drift per \u2022 C is 10 \u22126 . In addition to the systematic uncertainty, we estimate the statistical uncertainty from the fitting of the Lorentzian function 3.2 to be lower than 1 Hz (see also Fig. 10). As all these factors are substantially smaller than the intrinsic systematic uncertainty of the reference frequency, we take \u03c3 \u03bd = 10 2 Hz as the total frequency accuracy of our measurements. This corresponds to an error of \u03c3 m = 0.4 peV for the hidden photon mass, and hence this uncertainty would not affect the present WISPDMX measurements. It may however become a potentially adverse issue if one would attempt to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the resonant detection by summing multiple independent measurements.  Figure 11.

A scheme of the operational structure of WISPDMX measurements is shown in Fig. 14. The WISPDMX operations are ultimately structured into multiple measurement cycles. Each measurement cycle begins with a frequency calibration step (lasting for about 4 s). Subsequently, the data acquisition system acquires data for the current setting of the plunger assembly, and then the plunger assembly is moved to the next tuning position. These two operations are repeated ten times, before proceeding to the next measurement cycle. The output of both the frequency calibration module and the data acquisition system is stored on a local hard drive for offline processing and analysis.

The first and the last spectrum recorded over the course of the first science run are shown in the two panels of Fig. 15, demonstrating the stable broadband spectral profile. The broadband spectrum in the range below \u2248100 MHz is affected by the rapidly decreasing gain of the amplifier chain. In addition to this effect, there are several prominent and time-dependent noise peaks present in the spectrum. These noise peaks originate most likely from interference produced by one or several devices used in the measurements (e.g., the amplifiers, the radio switches, or the ADC clock) or from stray fields that penetrate the cavity, even though the cavity provides strong shielding. The stray noise may penetrate through the shielded coaxial cables, the coaxial connectors, and the unshielded amplifier box. The narrow band noise is subsequently amplified before recording it with the ADC. During the first science run, we did not have the capacity to fully investigate and eliminate the origins of these spurious features. Fortunately, most of them reside in the offresonance regions of the measured spectrum and cover multiple channels, and hence they can be easily mitigated and excluded from the analysis. These prominence of these interference signals should be reduced during the planned subsequent runs of WISPDMX which will be carried out with an improved setup and better radio shielding.",

The resulting number of level-I signal candidates reaching the significance level larger than 3 (S > 3) varies between 5 to 8, in a single ROI with \u2206\u03bd = 100 kHz. The level-I candidates are subsequently filtered using the position and amplitude test performed in the consecutive spectra. However, none of these level-I candidates pass the test on the expected variation of amplitude while tuning across the resonance. On the other hand, the level-I candidates are filtered using the line width test. Compliance with the expected line width of the hidden photon signal requires 5 consecutive channels with an excess for the TM 010 mode, 8 consecutive channels for the twin modes TE 111 , and 11 consecutive channels for the TM 020 mode. In our data, there are no such features, as none of the regions with the respective numbers of consecutive channels has a significance level of S > 2. This allows us to conclude that the resonant scan searches do not detect any candidate for the hidden photon signal above the level of 2\u03c3 single .

None of these quasi-periodic features has satisfied our selection criteria for a signal candidate, with most of them being limited to two spectral channels. We conclude nevertheless that the nature of this candidate signal needs to be further investigated with additional measurements that can be used to identify potential instrumental effects and to look for the annual modulation expected for the actual dark matter signal.  \u221260 km/s.

For the resonant modes, the sensitivity and exclusion limits can potentially be improved by applying the multiple bin analysis used in [42]. The quality of the broadband spectrum can be improved if the measurements are repeated in a better shielded environment which should help reducing the interference from external radio frequency signals, especially within the FM radio band at 80 MHz-110 MHz.",
