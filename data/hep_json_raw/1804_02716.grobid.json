The discovery was followed by a comprehensive set of studies of the properties of this new boson in the decay channels and production modes accessible with the LHC Run 1 data set. Measurements from ATLAS and CMS [7,8] have shown that the properties of the new boson are consistent with expectations for the SM Higgs boson [9][10][11][12][13][14].",

As a consequence, H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 was one of the most important channels for the discovery of the Higgs boson and first measurements of its properties [15,16]. In Run 2, with proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, this channel remains one of the most sensitive to continue the precise characterization of the Higgs boson. In this paper, measurements of the Higgs boson production rates with respect to the SM prediction (signal strength modifiers) are presented, along with measurements of the coupling modifiers to fermions and bosons, and effective coupling modifiers to photons and gluons, in the so-called \u03ba framework [17]. Improved precision on these parameters constrains possible deviations in the Higgs sector of the SM. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .",

Binned fits are used for speed of computation, and the chosen bin size of 250 MeV is sufficiently small compared to the mass resolution that no information is lost. The signal strength modifier \u00b5 is defined as the ratio of the observed Higgs boson rate in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel to the SM expectation. The data and the signal-plus-background model fit for each category are shown in figures 11-13. The m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution for the sum of all the categories is shown in figure 14. The one (green) and two (yellow) standard deviation bands shown for the background component of the fit include the uncertainty in the fitted parameters. Table 3 and figure 15 show the expected number of signal events for each category. The total number is broken down by the contribution (in percent) of each production mode -  Figure 10.

Systematic uncertainties are included in the form of nuisance parameters and the results are obtained using an asymptotic approach [52][53][54] with a test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio (q) [55]. The individual contributions of the statistical and systematic uncertainties are separated by performing a likelihood scan removing the systematic uncertainties to determine the statistical uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty is then taken as the difference in quadrature between the total uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty. The results can be found in figure 16.

The ratios are measured for the ggH, VBF, ttH, and VH production processes. VH is further split considering the decay of the associated boson into WH leptonic, ZH leptonic, and VH hadronic, which groups hadronic decays of both the W and Z bosons. The STXS approach differs from the signal strength modifier measurements in the splitting of the production modes, and reduces the dependence of the measurements on the theoretical uncertainties in the SM predictions, by avoiding the sizeable uncertainty associated with the extrapolation to the full phase space.
