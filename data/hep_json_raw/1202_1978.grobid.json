We search for stop pair production through the decayt 1t1 \u2192 bb\u00b5\u03c4\u03bd\u03bd, ort 1t1 \u2192 bb\u03c4 \u03c4 (\u2192 \u00b5\u03bd\u03bd)\u03bd\u03bd, in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3 fb \u22121 at a center-ofmass energy of 1.96 TeV, collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron pp Collider between April 2002 and July 2010. The signal topology consists of one isolated muon, one isolated \u03c4 lepton, and E / T coming mainly from undetected sneutrinos, and unreconstructed or mismeasured jets. The three-body decayt 1 \u2192 b \u03bd proceeds mainly through a virtual chargino\u03c7 + 1 (Fig. 1). In the MSSM, \u03c7 + 1 is the lightest mass eigenstate of the charged gauginohiggsino mass matrix that is a mixing of the win\u00f5 W + and the higgsinoH + , SUSY partners of the W boson and the charged Higgs boson, respectively. If\u03c7 + 1 is wino-like, the leptonic decay\u03c7 + 1 \u2192 +\u03bd occurs with equal rate to all lepton flavors. If\u03c7 + 1 is higgsino-like, the decay\u03c7 + 1 \u2192 \u03c4 +\u03bd is enhanced, owing to the large Yukawa coupling of the \u03c4 lepton. In that case, the deca\u1ef9 t 1 \u2192 b\u03c4\u03bd can be dominant. We consider two scenarios in our search that depend on the composition of the chargino. The wino scenario is defined by B(t 1 \u2192 b\u00b5\u03bd) = B(t 1 \u2192 b\u03c4\u03bd) = 1/3. For the higgsino scenario, we choose B(t 1 \u2192 b\u00b5\u03bd) = 0.1 and B(t 1 \u2192 b\u03c4\u03bd) = 0.8, which correspond to the maximal values reached with a scan of the MSSM parameter space using susy-hit [18]. In both scenarios, the signal is a combination of the bb\u00b5\u03c4\u03bd\u03bd and bb\u03c4 \u03c4\u03bd\u03bd final states.",

One of the main advantage of decision trees over analyses using simple requirements is that events that fail any individual selection criteria continue to be considered by the algorithm. The performance of the decision tree is improved by the boosting technique [36]. The basic principle is to create a tree, calculate an associated uncertainty, and create a new tree with a smaller uncertainty by re-weighting the misclassified events. We use adaptative boosting, known in the literature as AdaBoost [36]. The associated uncertainty n of a tree indexed by n is estimated as the fraction of misclassified events. The boosting weight of the n th tree is \u03b1 n = \u03b2 ln((1 \u2212 n )/ n ) where \u03b2 is an empirically determined parameter called boosting parameter. Misclassified events are given an additional multiplicative weight of e \u03b1n and the resulting new tree indexed by n + 1 is used to retrain the BDT and reduce the number of misclassified events. This procedure is repeated N times, where N is the number of boosting cycles. For the scalar top quark search, the best signal to background separation occurs for \u03b2 = 0.5 and N = 40.",

Systematic uncertainties related to reconstructed objects are estimated by changing each quantity by one standard deviation (s.d), and gauging the impact on the final measurement. Additional uncertainties arise from the choice of PDF, which affects the cross sections for the background components (6.3% for Z/\u03b3 * (\u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )+jets and Z/\u03b3 * (\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )+jets, 15% for W +jets and 10% for tt; 5.6%, 8.1%, and 5.5% for W W , W Z, and ZZ, respectively) and for signal (18% to 20%). To estimate the systematic uncertainties related to instrumental background, a MC scalar top quark signal is added as a background contribution during the stages that consider distribution and normalization of the MJ background. Each scalar top quark signal is considered, and the largest relative changes in the distribution and the normalization of the instrumental background are thereby estimated. The resulting uncertainties correspond to 5% and 10% for the normalization and the functional dependence, respectively.",

            "text": "In summary, a search for scalar top quark pair production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV has been performed in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3 fb \u22121 . Events containing one muon, one \u03c4 decaying hadronically, at least one jet, and missing transverse energy have been considered in this analysis. No evidence is found for the production of the lightest scalar top quark, and 95% CL exclusion limits are set in the plane [mt 1 ,m\u03bd]. The largest scalar top quark mass excluded is 200 GeV for a sneutrino mass of 45 GeV, and the largest sneutrino mass excluded is 85 GeV for a scalar top quark mass of 160 GeV. This is the first Tevatron limit obtained from a study of final states containing \u03c4 leptons fromt 1t1 \u2192 bb\u00b5\u03c4 E / T .",
