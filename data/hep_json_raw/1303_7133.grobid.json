The presence of pp in the final state allows intermediate states of any quantum numbers to be studied and the existence of the charged kaon in the final state significantly enhances the signal to background ratio in the selection procedure. Measurements of intermediate charmonium-like states, such as the X(3872), are important to clarify their nature [1,2] and to determine their partial width to pp, which is crucial to predict the production rate of these states in dedicated experiments [3]. BaBar and Belle have previously measured the B + \u2192 ppK + branching fraction, including contributions from the J /\u03c8 and \u03b7 c (1S) intermediate states [4,5]. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 , collected by LHCb at \u221a s = 7 TeV allows the study of substructures in the B + \u2192 ppK + decays with a sample ten times larger than those available at previous experiments.",

            "text": "The measurements of the relative branching fractions depend on the ratios of signal yields and efficiencies with respect to the reference mode. Since the final state is the same in all cases, most of the systematic uncertainties cancel. The systematic uncertainty on the efficiency ratio, in each region of pp invariant mass, is determined from the difference between the efficiency ratios calculated using the solid fitted line and the dashed point-by-point interpolation shown in Fig. 6. The uncertainty associated with the evaluation of the B + signal yield has been determined by varying the fit range by \u00b130 MeV/c 2 , using a single Gaussian instead of a double Gaussian function to model the signal PDF, and using an exponential function to model the background. For each charmonium resonance the systematic uncertainty on the signal yield has been investigated by varying the B mass signal window by \u00b110 MeV/c 2 , the signal and background shape parametrization and the subtraction of the cc contribution from the continuum. The systematic uncertainty associated with the parametrization of the signal tails of the J /\u03c8, \u03b7 c (1S) and \u03c8(2S) resonances is taken into account by taking the difference between the number of candidates in the observed distribution and the number of candidates calculated from the integral of the fit function in the range \u22126\u03c3 to \u22122.5\u03c3 . The systematic uncertainty associated with the selection procedure is estimated by changing the value of the BDT selection to \u22120.03, which retains 85 % of the signal with a 30 % background, and is found to be negligible. The contributions to the systematic uncertainties from the different sources are listed in Table 2. The total systematic uncertainty is determined by adding the individual contributions in quadrature.",
