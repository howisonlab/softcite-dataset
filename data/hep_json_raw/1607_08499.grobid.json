This article first considers measurements of cross-sections and related quantities at LHCb, which are generally used to probe and test QCD, either within the proton, studying PDFs, or within the hard interaction itself, where the modeling of higher order effects in perturbative QCD (pQCD), such as parton emission, can be tested by studying the transverse momentum of electroweak bosons and related variables. This article then considers a precision test of electroweak theory at LHCb: the measurement of the weak mixing angle. At each stage this article will set out the key motivations for performing such measurements in the forward rapidity region probed by LHCb. The measurements and results discussed here are based on data collected in the first period of LHC operations (LHC Run 1), where protons were collided at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, though the potential for future studies is also outlined.

Events containing a muon candidate with transverse momentum above 10 GeV are selected, while for electron candidates this threshold is 15 GeV. The LHCb trigger also implements a detector occupancy requirement, in order to remove a few large events which would otherwise dominate the processing time. \u2022 The tracking systems are located at different stages throughout the detector. Close to the interaction point is a silicon strip detector, the Vertex Locator (VELO). This is followed by a large silicon strip detector, a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three tracking stations (consisting of silicon strip detectors close to the beamline and straw drift tubes at larger angles). These provide a momentum resolution of about 1% for particles with momentum over 100 GeV, and allow the position of the interaction point in the transverse plane to be determined to a precision of \u223c 15 microns, with the precise resolution depending on the number of tracks associated to the vertex. 2,4 \u2022 Particle identification is achieved for muons using a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. 2 The electromagnetic calorimeter is used to identify electrons and photons. It was designed for the selection of low transverse energy (E T ) electromagnetic particles in the trigger. The readout is consequently optimized for the study of low E T physics, so correcting for the effects of bremsstrahlung from electrons poses a significant challenge. Regardless, electron directions, and consequently angular variables, are well determined by the tracking systems, and measurements at LHCb using electron final states provide important complementary information to studies using other final states. 5 \u2022 Jets are reconstructed using a particle flow algorithm, using the anti-k T algorithm, 6 and a radius parameter R = 0.5. The LHCb jet reconstruction is optimized for jets with p T up to about 100 GeV (since a jet produced with \u03b7 = 3 and p T = 50 GeV has total momentum over 500 GeV). The typical momentum resolution is roughly 10-15% for jets with p T > 20 GeV. The energy scale is known to an accuracy of about 3%, determined from the accuracy with which the energy of particles in the jet are measured, and confirmed in-situ through studies of the p T balance in Z+jet events. Heavy flavor jets are tagged by searching for secondary vertices in within the jets. A 65 (25)% tagging efficiency is achieved for b (c) jets with a 0.3% light jet misidentification rate. Partonic cross-sections are well known for W and Z boson production, with uncertainties at the level of 1-2%. 10 The PDF uncertainties on theoretical predictions for production cross-sections in proton-proton collisions can be significantly larger. Consequently measurements of electroweak boson production cross-sections provide benchmark tests of the proton structure, and can be used to test different approaches for modeling PDFs, and to place constraints on PDF fits, reducing PDF uncertainties. 11 Differential cross-sections with respect to rapidity are expected to be particularly useful for the study of PDFs, since the rapidity (y) of a boson with mass m can be related to the fractions of the proton longitudinal momenta carried by the colliding partons (the Bjorken-x values) through",

Consequently LHCb probes different values of Bjorken-x when studying electroweak boson production to ATLAS and CMS. The different regions probed by the LHC detectors in the x \u2212 Q 2 plane are shown in Fig. 1. For electroweak boson production in the LHCb acceptance the colliding partons typically have x values around 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22121 . Both regions of x probed by LHCb are of interest. Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model at much higher mass by ATLAS and CMS involve the collision of high x partons, so improvements to the understanding of PDFs through LHCb measurements have a direct impact here; any constraints achieved at high x by LHCb allow better understanding of Standard Model backgrounds in these searches, and will also allow any new physics signal to be understood more precisely. The low-x region has not been probed directly at electroweak energy scales before. Consequently measurements at these x-values provide important tests of DGLAP evolution of PDFs between different energy scales. 13-15,d LHCb measurements do not just reduce the PDF uncertainties in these two regions of x, since the functional form of the PDFs and review sum rules mean that LHCb data also have the ability to reduce the uncertainties on PDFs at intermediate values of x.

This section will concentrate on the inclusive measurements of W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5, [19][20][21] since these are the most precise measurements of electroweak boson production performed at LHCb, though measurements also exist of the Z boson production cross-section in the dielectron and ditau final states. 5,22,23 Given the limited forward acceptance of LHCb, measurements are made for a fiducial region, with no extrapolation to the full phase-space. For W bosons, the only fiducial requirements are that the muon produced by the W boson decay has p T > 20 GeV and 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5. In the analysis of Z boson decays, these requirements are made on both muons, in addition to the requirement that the dimuon invariant mass, m(\u00b5\u00b5), is in the range 60 < m(\u00b5\u00b5) < 120 GeV. This invariant mass requirement is necessary to remove the large virtual photon contribution at lower dimuon invariant masses, though study of the Drell-Yan process at low invariant masses is itself interesting and provides important PDF constraints at lower values of x. For the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 process the cross-sections are measured differentially as a function of the boson rapidity, the transverse momentum, and \u03c6 * \u03b7 . In addition the total cross-section within the fiducial region (the 'fiducial' cross-section) is found. For the W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd process both the fiducial cross-section and the differential cross-section as a function of the lepton pseudorapidity are measured separately for each boson charge. The W lepton charge asymmetry is determined from these measurements, as are ratios between the different fiducial cross-sections. These measurements are performed for both the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV datasets separately. The cross-sections are typically calculated from the number of events selected, the efficiencies associated with selection requirements and detecting the events, the purity of the selected sample and the integrated luminosity. Where necessary distributions are unfolded to correct for the effect of bin-to-bin migrations due to the detector response. The inclusive measurements are corrected for the effects of final state radiation (FSR), allowing final states containing different leptons can be directly compared. These correction factors are typically determined using HER-WIG++ and PYTHIA8, 24,25 with the difference between the two setting the uncertainty associated with the correction.",

The muon identification efficiency is determined by only placing the muon identification requirements on one of the leptons, the tag. The fraction of events where the other lepton, the probe, is identified as a muon defines this efficiency. The method is validated by applying it to simulation, where no bias is observed. The uncertainty associated with the efficiency determination is therefore set by the size of the sample used. The efficiencies for track reconstruction and for the triggering on a single lepton are found in a similar way, save that the efficiency associated with the occupancy requirement in the trigger is found separately. This requirement has negligible inefficiency in events containing only one proton-proton interaction. Distributions for events with multiple interactions are constructed using data selected with a minimum bias trigger configuration and from collisions where only one proton-proton interaction takes place, and where an electroweak boson is produced. These distributions can then be used to determine the efficiency of the occupancy requirement. This is cross-checked using additional triggers with looser occupancy requirements; the efficiency is found to be consistent between the two methods at the per-mille level. The efficiency of the additional requirements applied to select the W boson sample (that the muon is isolated and associated to a primary vertex, and that there are no other muons in the event) is determined by measuring the effect of these requirements on the high-purity Z boson sample.",

The asymmetry changes sign at high muon pseudorapidity, as the W \u2212 cross-section becomes larger than the W + cross-section. This arises from the V \u2212 A structure of the weak force: muons tend to be produced in the direction of the initial state quark, while anti-muons tend to be produced in the direction of the initial state anti-quark. The main theory uncertainty associated with the asymmetry is due to the PDFs, since other effects cancel. The high precision of the data relative to the theory uncertainties and the spread in predictions from different PDF sets gives the LHCb data considerable power to constrain the PDFs (the overall impact of LHCb measurements is discussed briefly below). The LHCb phase space is also complementary to that probed at ATLAS and CMS; Fig. 3 compares the ATLAS results for the differential charge asymmetry as a function of lepton pseudorapidity to those determined at LHCb for \u221a s = 7 TeV collisions, with simulation used to extrapolate the LHCb measurement for the effects of additional fiducial requirements present in the AT-LAS measurement.

The largest uncertainties associated with a W boson mass measurement at any LHC experiment are expected to arise from knowledge of the PDFs. However, the PDF uncertainties are anticorrelated between the ATLAS and CMS acceptance and the LHCb acceptance, such that any measurement at LHCb has a significant impact on the overall uncertainty in any combined LHC measurement. It is claimed that a combination of a measurement in the central region with a LHCb measurement will therefore be more precise than a combination of two measurements in the central region, and that a combination of ATLAS, CMS and LHCb measurements should be a factor of 1.3 more precise than a combination of ATLAS and CMS alone. 53 A combined measurement of the W boson mass using information from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb could reach a precision of about 10 MeV, improving on the current world average (15 MeV), assuming that the production processes are well understood. 53 A measurement of the W boson mass will therefore prove an important extension of LHCb's study of electroweak physics.",

Measurements of electroweak boson production cross-sections are consistent with Standard Model predictions, and have provided important constraints on PDFs at both low-x and at high-x, and have significantly reduced PDF uncertainties when included in global PDF fits. Various ratios of fiducial cross-sections are also able to test the Standard Model below the percent-level. Such studies will be complemented by similar measurements using the higher energy data currently being recorded. LHCb is also able to probe the weak mixing angle, through the study of the forward-backward asymmetry in Z boson decays. The forward region is particularly sensitive to such a measurement, since the dilution between the parton-level and proton-level asymmetry is reduced. The LHCb measurement is the most precise at the LHC, and is still statistically limited. Improved precision in this measurement is expected with analysis of the data currently being recorded.",
