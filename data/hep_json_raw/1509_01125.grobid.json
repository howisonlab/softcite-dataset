In this paper a general review on dependency between charge asymmetry constructed for semileptonic decays of short-and long-lived kaons and CPT symmetry is given. The current status of determination of charge asymmetry for short-lived kaon, obtained by reconstruction of about 10 5 KS \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd decays collected at DA\u03a6NE with the KLOE detector is also reviewed.",

Nevertheless, all of the mentioned symmetries plays an important role in particle physics, especially in calculations of the cross sections and decay rates. Weak interaction does not conserve the C, P, T or combined CP symmetry. However, up to now, there is no indication of CPT symmetry violation [1], which would also imply the break of Lorentz symmetry [2]. A special role in CPT violation searches plays a neutral kaon system which, due to a sensitivity to a variety of symmetry violation effects, is one of the best candidates for such kind of studies. One of the possible tests is based on comparison between semileptonic asymmetry in K S decays (A S ) and the analogous asymmetry in K L decays (A L ).",

DA\u03a6NE collider produce \u223c 1300 kaon pairs per second which corresponds to the luminosity 5 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . In order to obtain efficient detection of the K L mesons the KLOE detector was constructed with a view to properties of neutral kaon system. A schematic cross-section side view of the KLOE detector is shown in Figure 2. The main components of KLOE are the cylindrical drift chamber and the calorimeter, both surrounding the beam pipe. All elements are immersed in a 0.52 T magnetic field created by superconducting coils that are placed along the beam axis. The KLOE drift chamber (DC) is a 3.3 m long cylinder with an internal and external radii of 25 cm and 2 m, respectively, which allows to register about 40% of K L decays inside the chamber while the rest reach the electromagnetic calorimeter. Between the endplates around 12500 sense wires are streched and allows to obtain: a spatial resolution in the r, \u03d5 plane better than 200 \u00b5m, a resolution along the z axis of \u223c 2 mm and on the resolution of the decay vertex determination of \u223c 1 mm. Moreover, the curvature of the reconstructed tracks allows to determine the particle momentum with a relative accuracy of 0.4 %. The drift chamber allows to reconstruct information about charged particles while the calorimeter enables recording of both charged and neutral particles.

Those changes should increase by factor of three the amount of the delivered luminosity with respect to the performance reached before. Together with the upgrade of the KLOE detector this will allow to collect by KLOE-2 project the order of 10 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The detector itself was equipped with crystal (CCALT) [11] and tile (QCALT) [12] calorimeters which covers the low polar angles and improve the detection of the photons that are coming from K L decays in the drift chamber, respectively. Also, there were mounted the two pairs of small angle tagging devices that allows to detect the low (Low Energy Tagger [13]) and high (High Energy Tagger [14]) energy e + e \u2212 originated from e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 X reactions. However, the especially important for studies of CPT symmetry violation through semileptonic decays in neutral kaons is precise reconstruction of tracks momenta and vertex reconstruction close to the Interaction Point. This will be provided by Inner Tracker detector made out in a novel GEM technology [15]. Those upgrades will also improve the sensitivity of CPT and Lorentz invariance tests, which were presented by the KLOE experiment and became the most precise measurement of the CPT violating parameters \u2206a \u00b5 for neutral kaons in the Standard Model Extension (SME) [16]. Measured values of \u2206a \u00b5 currently have a precision of 10 \u221218 GeV and are proportional to the parameter \u03b4 K [17,18,19]. It should be emphasised that KLOE-2 aims to significantly improve the sensitivity of tests of discrete symmetries, through studies of K S charge asymmetry or quantum interferometry effects in the kaon decays, beyond the presently achieved results.",
