The data analyzed were recorded in proton-proton collisions at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.7 fb \u22121 . The final state considered in this analysis is particularly sensitive to signatures of a Higgs sector beyond the standard model, as predicted in the generic class of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs). No signal above the standard model background expectation is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are set for Higgs bosons with masses up to 1300 GeV. The results are interpreted within several MSSM and 2HDM scenarios.",

Its production in association with b quarks and subsequent decay into b quarks at the CERN LHC is, however, difficult to detect because of the high rate of heavy-flavour multijet production. There are, nevertheless, models beyond the SM that predict an enhancement of Higgs boson production in association with b quarks, which motivate the search for such processes.",

The additional constraints given by the fermion-boson symmetry fix all mass relations between the Higgs bosons and the angle \u03b1 at tree level, reducing the number of parameters at this level to only two. These parameters are commonly chosen as the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson, m A , and tan \u03b2. After the Higgs boson discovery at the LHC, MSSM benchmark scenarios have been refined to match the experimental data and to reveal characteristic features of certain regions of the parameter space [7,8]. Considered in this analysis are the m mod+ h , the hMSSM [9], the light stau ( \u03c4 ), and the light stop ( t) scenarios [7]. The m mod+ h scenario is a modification of the m max h scenario, which was originally defined to give conservative exclusion bounds on tan \u03b2 in the LEP Higgs boson searches [10][11][12]. It has been modified such that the mass of the lightest CP -even state, m h , is compatible with the mass of the observed boson within \u00b13 GeV [13,14] in a large fraction of the considered parameter space [7]. The hMSSM approach [9,15,16] describes the MSSM Higgs sector in terms of just m A and tan \u03b2, given the experimental knowledge of m Z and m h . It defines a largely model-independent scenario, because the predictions for the properties of the MSSM Higgs bosons do not depend on the details of the supersymmetric sector [17].",

The analysis focuses on neutral Higgs bosons A and H with masses m A/H \u2265 300 GeV that are produced in association with at least one b quark and decay to bb, as shown by the diagrams in figure 1. The signal signature therefore comprises final states characterized by at least three b quark jets (\"b jets\"), and the dominant background is multijet production. A fourth b jet is not explicitly required, since due to the process topology the majority of the signal events are found to have at most three b jets within the acceptance of this analysis. Events are selected by dedicated triggers that identify b jets already during data taking. This helps significantly to suppress the large rate of multijet production, while maintaining sensitivity to the signal process. The analysis searches for a peak in the invariant mass distribution, M 12 , of the two b jets with the highest transverse momentum p T values, which originate from the Higgs boson decay in about 66% of all cases at m A/H = 300 GeV, increasing up to 75% for m A/H \u2265 700 GeV. The dominant background is -3 - the production of heavy-flavour multijet events containing either three b jets, or two b jets plus a third jet originating from either a charm quark, a light-flavour quark, or a gluon, which is misidentified as a b jet.

The MSSM Higgs boson signal samples, pp \u2192 bb\u03c6+X with \u03c6 \u2192 bb, were produced at leading order (LO) in the 4-flavour scheme with pythia 8.212 [45]. Comparing this prediction to computationally expensive next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations [46] generated using MadGraph5 amc@nlo in version 2.3.0 [47,48], we find a very good agreement in the shapes of the leading dijet invariant mass distribution, M 12 , while the selection efficiency is up to 10% lower when using the NLO prediction. We correct the NLO effect by applying mass-dependent correction factors to the LO signal samples and assign a corresponding systematic uncertainty in the final results. Multijet background events from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes have been simulated with the MadGraph5 amc@nlo event generator [49,50] using the 5-flavour scheme and MLM merging [51]; they are used for studying qualitative features but not for a quantitative background prediction. The NNPDF 3.0 [52] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used in all generated samples. For all generators, fragmentation, hadronization, and the underlying event have been modelled using pythia with tune CUETP8M1 [53].

We congratulate our colleagues in the CERN accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the computing centres and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses. Finally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: BMWFW and FWF (Austria); FNRS and FWO (Bel-",
