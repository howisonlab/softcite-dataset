It is expected that the neutral kaon can acquire finite electromagnetic form factors because its wave function is affected by the order of magnitude difference between the mass of the strange quark and that of the down quark, or flavor S U(3) breaking. We report on the first measurement of the form factor of neutral kaons at the large timelike momentum transfer of |Q 2 | = 17.4 GeV 2 by measuring the cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K L at \u221a s = 4.17 GeV using CLEO-c data with an integrated luminosity of 586 pb \u22121 . We obtain F K S K L (17.4 GeV 2 ) = 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , with a 90% C.L. interval of (2.9 \u2212 8.2) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . This is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than F K + K \u2212 (17.4 GeV 2 ) = (44 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , and indicates that the effect of S U(3) breaking is small. In turn, this makes it unlikely that the recently observed strong violation of the pQCD prediction,",

            "text": "The quark-gluon structure of hadrons is of the greatest interest for our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction. One of the most important tools for the study of the internal structure of hadrons is the measurement of their electromagnetic form factors at large momentum transfers at which the probe photon sees the charges and spins of the quarks and gluons in the hadron rather than the composite hadron. Measurements of the electromagnetic form factors of the neutral mesons are particularly important because they can acquire finite values only due to their internal structure. Open-flavor neutral pseudoscalar mesons like K 0 , D 0 , B 0 , and B 0 s , which contain a quark and an antiquark of different flavors and masses, can have finite electromagnetic form factors. Kaons offer one of the best opportunities to study how the different masses of the constituent quarks affect the quark wave functions. With the strange quark being more than an order of magnitude more massive than the up/down quarks [1] the S U(3) flavor symmetry is broken in the kaon, and its wave function acquires an antisymmetric component. According to perturbative QCD (pQCD), measurement of the form factor of the neutral kaon at a large momentum transfer provides a sensitive measure of the effect of S U (3) breaking [2]. Unfortunately, the existing measurements of timelike form factors of neutral kaons are limited to small momentum transfers [3,4]. These include several measurements made at Novosibirsk by the CMD-2 and SND Collaborations between 1971 and 2006 [3,4]. All these measurements are limited to \u221a s < 1.38 GeV, or |Q 2 | < 1.90 GeV 2 . The latest of these [4] reports an average cross section of \u223c 0.30 nb in the  [3] and in the region \u221a s = 1.400\u22122.175 GeV [3,5]. For the region, \u221a s = 1.800 \u2212 2.175 GeV, s \u2248 4 GeV 2 , they report \u03c3 = 0.053 \u00b1 0.038 nb, and F 2 K S K L = 0.014 \u00b1 0.011, or F K S K L (4 GeV 2 ) = 0.12 \u00b1 0.05. In this Letter we report on the first measurement of the electromagnetic form factor of the neutral kaon, F K S K L (|Q 2 |), for the large timelike momentum transfer of |Q 2 | = 17.4 GeV 2 . Our measurement provides an estimate of the level of S U(3) breaking in the kaon wave function, and also allows us to comment on the conjecture that S U(3) breaking might be responsible for the recently observed large violation [6] of the pQCD prediction that for large momentum transfers the ratio of the form factors of the pion and the kaon, F(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/F(K \u00b1 ) should be equal the ratio of the squares of their decay constants, f 2 \u03c0 / f 2 K [7,8].",

However, Lepage and Brodsky [2] have pointed out that S U(3) breaking would give rise to an odd asymmetric component in the kaon wave function, and conjectured that if it were large it would lead to a large form factor for the neutral kaon. Chernyak and Zhitnitsky [9] proposed two-humped wave functions for pions and kaons based on QCD sum-rules, and predicted that the antisymmetric component in the kaon wave function due to S U(3) breaking is large. They did not calculate the form factor of the neutral kaon, but found its effect on the form factor of the charged kaon to be quite large. However, subsequent improved QCD sum-rule calculations predicted that the S U(3) breaking effect on the wave function of the kaon is small [10]. Recent lattice simulations [11] and Ads/CFT-based QCD calculations [12] also find small S U(3) breaking effects.",

Fig. 1 shows such a distribution normalized with the total number of events in the region X = 0.60 \u2212 0.98. It leads to the estimate of 0.3 background events in the signal region, X = 0.98 \u2212 1.02. The central value of signal events is thus 3.7.

Our measured value of the ratio, F K S K L /F K + K \u2212 = 0.12 in Eq. 6, and even the 90% CL upper limit of 0.19 are much smaller than being \"of order 1\". We therefore conclude that the present measurement implies that the S U(3) breaking effect on the quark wave function of the kaon is small. The present measurement enables us to also address the question of the relative magnitudes of the form factors of the charged kaon and pion. In our recent precision measurement of these form factors it was found that the ratio F \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (|Q 2 |)/F K + K \u2212 (|Q 2 |) = 1.09 \u00b1 0.04 for |Q 2 | = 17.4 GeV 2 . This is in strong disagreement, by more than 9 sigma, with the pQCD prediction that for large momentum transfers this ratio should be equal to the ratio of the squares of the pion and kaon decay constants, f 2 \u03c0 / f 2 K = 0.70 \u00b1 0.01. Since this pQCD prediction is based on the assumption of similar wave functions for pions and kaons, it was conjectured by Lepage and Brodsky [2] that its violation could perhaps be explained by the effect of S U(3) breaking in the kaon wave function, if it were found to be large. Our present evidence for a small S U(3) breaking effect in the kaon wave function makes it unlikely that it is responsible for the observed large violation of the pQCD prediction for F(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )/F(K + K \u2212 ) [2], and other possible explanations need to be considered.",
