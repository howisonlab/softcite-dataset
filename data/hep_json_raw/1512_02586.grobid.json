Events are selected containing at least three jets with scalar sum of jet transverse momenta (H T ) greater than 1 TeV. No excess is seen at large H T and limits are presented on new physics: models which produce final states containing at least three jets and having cross sections larger than 1.6 fb with H T > 5.8 TeV are excluded. Limits are also given in terms of new physics models of strong gravity that hypothesize additional space-time dimensions.",

            "text": "Many models of gravity postulate a fundamental gravitational scale comparable to the electroweak scale, hence allowing the production of non-perturbative gravitational states, such as micro black holes and string balls (highly excited string states) at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collision energies [1][2][3][4]. If black holes or string balls with masses much higher than this fundamental gravitational scale are produced at the LHC, they behave as classical thermal states and decay to a relatively large number of high transverse momentum (p T ) particles. One of the predictions of these models is that particles are emitted from black holes at rates which primarily depend on the number of Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom (number of charge, spin, flavour, and colour states). Spin-dependent effects, such as the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions in statistical mechanics, and gravitational transmission factors (also dependent on spin) are less important. Several searches were carried out using data from Run-1 at the LHC at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV by ATLAS [5][6][7][8][9] and CMS [10][11][12]. The analysis described here follows the method of a similar ATLAS analysis using 8 TeV data [5]. The increase in the LHC energy to 13 TeV in Run-2 brings a large increase in the sensitivity compared to Run-1; for the data set used here the increase is of the order of 50% in the energy scale being probed. Another analysis looking at dijet final states [13] is also sensitive to new physics of the type discussed here.",

A fit-based technique is used to extrapolate from the control region to a high-H T signal region to estimate the amount of the SM background. The observation is compared to the background-only expectation determined by the fit-based method. In the absence of significant deviations from the background-only expectation, 95% Confidence Level (CL) limits on micro black hole and string-ball production are set.

It consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector and a transition radiation straw-tube tracker. The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer, was added between Run-1 and Run-2 of the LHC, at a radius of 33 mm around a new, thinner, beam pipe. In the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 3.2, high granularity liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeters are used. An iron-scintillator tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage over |\u03b7| < 1.7. The end-cap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with LAr calorimetry for both EM and hadronic measurements. The muon spectrometer surrounds these calorimeters, and comprises a system of precision tracking chambers for muon reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.7 and trigger detectors with three large toroids, each consisting of eight coils providing magnetic fields for the muon detectors.",

The boundaries of these regions (C, V and S) depend on the integrated luminosity of the data sample used and inclusive jet multiplicity requirement. The following criteria must be satisfied: the lower boundary of the control region (C) should be sufficiently large that the shape of the H T distribution near the boundary is not distorted by event selection effects; contamination from a possible signal due to new physics in the control region must be small for all possible signals not excluded by prior results. There should be some background events in the validation region whose lower boundary is deterined by V , with a small signal to background ratio from signals that are not excluded by a previous analysis, so that the background extrapolation can be checked.

A data set of a few fb \u22121 has such a large range of sensitivity that significant signal contamination in the control and validation regions is possible. Therefore, a bootstrap approach is adopted and data sets are examined whose size increases by approximately a factor of ten at each step, starting with a sample whose sen-JHEP03(2016)026 sitivity is slightly beyond the Run-1 limit; simulation studies indicate an initial integrated luminosity of up to 10 pb \u22121 would be free of signal contamination. This will ensure that if a search in one step sees no new physics, the possible contributions of signal to the control and validation regions of the next step are small. For each data set the boundaries of the regions are determined as follows. Simulations are normalized to data in the normalization region, which is 1.5 TeV< H T < 2.9 TeV. First, the lower boundary of the validation region, V , is chosen from this normalized MC simulation so that at least 20 events are expected for S > H T > V . This will allow a quantitative comparison of the data and expectation in the validation region to check that the extrapolation procedure is working properly. The lower boundary of the control region (C) is determined by requiring that the fit functions applied to MC-pseudo-data have a reduced \u03c7 2 distribution peaked near one and then choosing C to minimize the pseudo-experiment-based uncertainty.
