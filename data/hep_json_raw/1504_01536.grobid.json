The search is performed in events where the top quark decays to a W b pair and the W boson decays to a charged lepton and a neutrino; the two bottom quarks hadronize and produce two clusters of particles (jets). Since no assumptions on the signal model other than on the natural width are made, this search is sensitive to any narrow resonant state decaying to a tb final state. A simple left-right symmetric SM extension [11], predicting the existence of W bosons of unknown mass and universal weak-coupling strength to SM fermions, is used as a benchmark model. The reconstructed width of the signal is dominated by resolution effects; the test signal is therefore applicable for any W -like particle whose width is small compared to the experimental resolution.",

One leading jet is required to be within the silicon detector acceptance, |\u03b7| < 0.8; the other satisfies |\u03b7| < 2.0. In addition to the large missing transverse-energy indicating the presence of a high-p T neutrino, the presence of a W boson decaying to an e\u03bd e or \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 pair is confirmed by requiring a reconstructed electron or muon. Leptonically decaying \u03c4 leptons are collected in the same way. Hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons from the W decay chain are mostly reconstructed as jets in the calorimeter. Three-jet events are thus retained, while events with more than three jets with E j T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are excluded. The majority of the background at this stage is quantum crhomodynamics (QCD) production of multijet events, which yields / E T generated through jet-energy mismeasurements. Neutrinos produced in semileptonic b-hadron decays also contribute to the / E T of these events. In both cases, the / E T is typically aligned with the projection on the transverse plane of the second or third jet momentum.

The jetprob algorithm [17] determines the probability that the tracks within a jet originate from the primary vertex; we choose for the latter algorithm the loose (L) working point. The efficiency for each b-tagging algorithm is approximately 40-50%. We require at least one of the first two leading jets in E T to be tagged by the secvtx algorithm. Events are further divided among twelve statistically independent subsamples, depending on whether there are no additional b\u2212tagged jets (1T), or an additional jet is tagged by jetprob but not by secvtx (TL), or tagged by secvtx (TT), the number of jets (two-jet or three-jet sample) and the presence or absence of a reconstructed electron or muon. This division increases sensitivity because signal-to-noise ratio and background composition differ across subsamples. The resulting preselection sample contains 25 256 events, to which a W boson with SM-like couplings and 300 GeV/ c 2 mass would contribute about 480 events.",

The kine-matic distributions of events associated with top-quark pair, single top quark, V+jets, W + c, diboson (V V ) and associated Higgs and W or Z boson (V H) production are modeled using simulated samples. The alpgen generator [18] is used to model V+jets at leading order (LO) in the strong-interaction coupling with up to four partons produced at tree level, based on generator-toreconstructed-jet matching [19,20]. The powheg [21] generator is used to model t-and s-channel single top quark production, while pythia [22] is used to model top-quark-pair, V V , and V H production. Each event generator uses the CTEQ5L parton distribution functions (PDF) [23]. Parton showering is simulated using pythia. Event modeling also includes simulation of the detector response using geant [24]. The simulated events are reconstructed and analyzed in the same way as the experimental data. Normalizations of the contributions from tand s-channel single top quark, V V , V H, and tt pair production are taken from theoretical cross-sections [25][26][27][28], while the normalization for W + c production is taken from the measured cross section [29]. For V+jets production, the heavy-flavor contribution is normalized based on the number of b-tagged events observed in an independent data control sample [30]. Contributions of V+jets and V V events containing at least one incorrectly b-tagged light-flavored jet are determined by applying to simulated events a per-event probability, obtained from a generic event sample containing mostly light-flavored jets [31,32]. The efficiency of the trigger-level selection is measured in data and applied to all simulated samples.",

We employ a Bayesian likelihood [37] with a uniform, non-negative prior probability for the W  boson production cross section times branching fraction, \u03c3(pp \u2192 W ) \u00d7 B(W \u2192 tb), and truncated Gaussian priors for the uncertainties on the acceptance and shapes of the backgrounds.

Systematic uncertainties include both uncertainties on template normalization and uncertainties on the shape of the NN sig distribution. Uncertainties due to the same source are considered 100% correlated. These uncertainties apply to both signal and backgrounds, and include luminosity measurement (6%), b-tagging efficiency (8 to 16%), trigger efficiency (1 to 3%), lepton identification efficiency (2%), parton distribution functions (3%), initialstate and final-state radiation simulation uncertainties (2%) and up to 6% for the jet-energy scale [14].

The production rates of events with a W or a Z boson plus heavy-flavor jets are associated with a 30% uncertainty. The shapes obtained by varying the b-tagging probability f i by one standard deviation from their central values are applied as uncertainties on the shapes of the QCD background. Changes in the shape of the NN sig distribution originating from jet-energy-scale uncertainties are also incorporated for processes modeled with simulations.
