            "text": "Two related searches for phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM) are performed using events with hadronic jets and significant transverse momentum imbalance. The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016-2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 . The first search is inclusive, based on signal regions defined by the hadronic energy in the event, the jet multiplicity, the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, and the value of the kinematic variable M T2 for events with at least two jets. For events with exactly one jet, the transverse momentum of the jet is used instead. The second search looks in addition for disappearing tracks produced by BSM longlived charged particles that decay within the volume of the tracking detector. No excess event yield is observed above the predicted standard model background. This is used to constrain a range of BSM models that predict the following: the pair production of gluinos and squarks in the context of supersymmetry models conserving R-parity, with or without intermediate long-lived charginos produced in the decay chain; the resonant production of a colored scalar state decaying to a massive Dirac fermion and a quark; or the pair production of scalar and vector leptoquarks each decaying to a neutrino and a top, bottom, or light-flavor quark. In most of the cases, the results obtained are the most stringent constraints to date.",

Similar searches were previously conducted by both the ATLAS [2][3][4][5][6][7] and CMS [8][9][10][11][12] Collaborations. Our analysis builds on the work presented in Refs. [9,11], using improved methods to estimate the background from standard model (SM) processes, in particular the multijet background arising from instrumental effects. Event counts in bins of the number of jets (N j ), the number of jets identified as originating from the fragmentation of a bottom quark (b-tagged jets, N b ), the scalar p T sum of all selected jets (H T ), and the M T2 variable or the p T of the single jet, are compared against estimates of the background from SM processes, as derived from dedicated data control samples.",

In such scenarios, some theoretical models [13,14] predict the existence of long-lived charged particles that can be identified as disappearing tracks, when they decay within the volume of the tracking detector and their charged decay products are below the p T detection threshold. Such signatures are rare in the SM and are often dominated by instrumental effects. The presence of disappearing tracks is exploited in order to suppress the background from SM processes, and to enhance the sensitivity towards these scenarios. Similar analyses were previously conducted by both the ATLAS [15,16] and CMS [17][18][19][20] Collaborations. We use events with at least two jets, and the M T2 variable to further suppress the background from SM processes. Event counts in bins of N j , H T , disappearing track length, and disappearing track p T are compared against estimates of the background from SM processes derived from dedicated data control samples.",

            "text": "Finally, the inclusive M T2 search is interpreted using models of leptoquark (LQ) pair production, similarly to Ref. [11]. Leptoquarks are hypothetical particles with quantum numbers of both quarks and leptons [38]. The spin of an LQ state is either 0 (scalar LQ or LQ S ) or 1 (vector LQ or LQ V ). Leptoquarks appear in BSM theories such as grand unified theories [38][39][40][41], technicolor models [42][43][44][45], compositeness scenarios [46,47], and R-parity violating SUSY [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]48], and have been suggested as an explanation of the anomalies observed in flavor physics [49][50][51][52][53][54][55]   [54,55] predicts an LQ V with a mass of O (TeV) decaying with 50% branching fraction to either a top quark and a neutrino (t\u03bd) or a bottom quark and a \u03c4 lepton (b\u03c4), which would be expected to be visible at the LHC. The final states and kinematic variables resulting from the pair production of LQ S , each decaying to a quark and a neutrino, are the same as those considered in searches for squark pair production in R-parity conserving SUSY, assuming that the squark decays directly to a quark and a massless neutralino [11,69]. The decay products of LQ V are also found to have similar kinematic properties [11,69]. Therefore, as the search presented in this paper is already optimized for squark pair production, it is also sensitive to LQ pair production. The LQ production with decays to a quark and a neutrino has been constrained using LHC data by both the ATLAS [70-72] and CMS [11,[73][74][75][76][77] Collaborations, either by reinterpreting the existing squark searches, or considering scenarios with mixed branching fractions where an LQ also decays to a quark and a charged lepton. The  After a brief description of the CMS detector in Sect. 2, the event selection and categorization as well as details of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the SM background estimation. Results and their interpretations are presented in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, a summary is provided in Sect. 7.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to about 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector and trigger system, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Refs. [92,93]. The pixel tracker was upgraded before the start of the data taking period in 2017, providing one additional layer of measurements compared to the older tracker [94].",

Only jets passing the selection criteria in Table 1 are used for counting and for the determination of kinematic variables. In particular, we consider jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, unless otherwise stated. Jets that contain the decay of a bottom-flavored hadron are identified using a deep neural network algorithm [102] with a working point chosen such that the efficiency to identify a bottom quark jet is in the range 55-70% for jet p T between 20 and 400 GeV. The misidentification rate is approximately 1-2% for light-flavor or gluon jets, and 10-15% for charm jets. We count b-tagged jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. The minimum p T threshold used for counting b-tagged jets is lowered to 20 GeV instead of 30, as used for N j , in order to maximize the sensitivity towards BSM scenarios with bottom quarks. The negative of the vector p T sum of all selected jets is denoted by H miss T , while the missing transverse momentum p miss T is defined as the negative of the vector p T sum of all reconstructed PF candidates. Their magnitudes are referred to as H miss T and p miss T , respectively. The p miss T is further adjusted to reflect the jet energy corrections [100,101]. Events with possible contributions from beam halo processes or anomalous noise in the calorimeter are rejected using dedicated filters [103,104]. For events with at least two jets, we start with the pair having the largest dijet invariant mass and iteratively cluster all selected jets using an algorithm that minimizes the Lund distance measure [105,106] until two stable pseudo-jets are obtained. The resulting pseudo-jets together with the p miss T are used to calculate the kinematic variable M T2 [1] as:",

Other background processes are also considered: ttV samples with up to two additional partons in the matrix element calculations are generated at LO precision with the MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2 generator, while single top quark samples are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) precision with the MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2 or powheg (v1.0, or v2.0) [111][112][113][114][115] generators.

We consider production of either LQ S or LQ V . In each case, we assume that only one LQ state is within mass reach of the LHC, and that the LQ decays with 100% branching fraction to a neutrino and a single type of quark: a light-flavor quark (q = u, d, s, or c), a bottom quark, or a top quark. The cross sections for LQ S (LQ V ) pair production are computed to NLO (LO) order in \u03b1 S following Ref. [55]. The LQ S pair production cross section depends only on the LQ mass. For LQ V , additional constraints are imposed by unitarity at high energy scales, leading to model dependent solutions and thus production cross sections. In the model of Ref. [55], developed to explain the flavor physics anomalies, the additional relevant parameter for the LQ V pair production cross section is \u03ba, a dimensionless coupling that is 1 in the Yang-Mills case and 0 in the minimal coupling case. We consider both values. For \u03ba = 1, the cross section for the LQ V pair production is a factor 5-20 times larger than that of LQ S , depending on the LQ mass. In the LQ V model, other free parameters are g t L and g b L , the couplings of the LQ V to t\u03bd and b\u03c4 pairs, respectively. However, g t L and g b L do not affect the cross section or the kinematics for the LQ V pair production, and we assume g t L = g b L = 0.1, as predicted to explain the flavor physics anomalies.",

All possible decays are assumed to occur with equal probability. Thus, the gluino branching fraction is 1/3 each for the decay to\u03c7 0 1 ,\u03c7 + 1 , and \u03c7 \u2212 1 , and the squark branching fraction is 1/2 to\u03c7 0 1 and 1/2 to the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 of opposite charge. The\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 1 are assumed to be wino-like, and their masses to differ by a few hundred MeV [13,14]. Thus, the phase space for the decay of the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 to \u00e3 \u03c7 0 1 and a charged pion is small. As a consequence, the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 has lifetime of the order of a few nanoseconds, and the momentum of the pion originating from its decay does not exceed a few hundred MeV. Hence, the final state shows negligible dependence on small variations of the mass difference between\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 1 . Lifetimes of the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 are probed in the range c\u03c4 0 (\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = 1-2000 cm. Uncertainties in the signal yield for the simplified models considered are listed in Table 7.

The area enclosed by the thick black curve represents the observed exclusion region, while the dashed red lines indicate the expected limits and their \u00b11 and \u00b12 standard deviation (s.d.) ranges. The thin black lines show the effect of the theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross section. Signal cross sections are calculated at approximately NNLO+NNLL order in \u03b1 S [136][137][138][139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146][147], assuming 50% branching fraction (B) for each decay mode in the mixed-decay scenarios, or unity branching fraction for the indicated decay other tagging and lepton efficiencies are neglected. Other uncertainties associated with the modeling of disappearing tracks are treated as correlated across search bins. Specifically, an uncertainty in the signal yield is assigned, equal to one half of the track selection inefficiency: 25 (17.5)% for P (M and L) tracks in 2016, and 10% for tracks of all lengths in 2017-2018. Additionally, a 6% uncertainty in the 2017-2018 signal yield is assigned to account for inaccu-  Figure 11 shows the exclusion limits at 95% CL for direct gluino pair production where the gluinos decay to light-flavor quarks under three different decay scenarios. Exclusion limits for direct gluino pair production where the gluinos decay to bottom and top quarks are shown in Fig. 12, and those for the direct production of squark pairs are shown in Fig. 13. Three alternate decay scenarios are also considered for the direct pair production of top squarks, and their exclusion limits are shown in Fig. 14. Table 8 summarizes the limits on the masses of SUSY particles excluded for the simplified model scenarios considered. These results extend the constraints on gluino and squark masses by about 100-350 GeV and on the\u03c7 0 1 mass by 100-250 GeV with respect to the limits in Ref. [9]. Figure 15 shows the exclusion limits for the mono-\u03c6 model [35,36]. Based on the LO cross section calculation, we obtain mass limits as large as 1660 and 925 GeV on m \u03c6 and on m \u03c8 , respectively. In this model, the analysis of Refs. [35,36] reports best fit parameters m \u03c6 , m \u03c8 = (1250, 900) GeV and product of the cross section and branching fraction of about 0.3 pb. For this mass point, we find a modest (1.1 standard deviations) excess, and we set an upper limit on the product of the cross section and branching fraction of about 0.6 (0.4 expected) pb, equal to 4.7 (3.2) times the assumed LO theoretical cross section.",

It is based on an LQ V that can decay to t\u03bd and to b\u03c4 final states, each with 50% Fig. 15 Exclusion limit at 95% CL for the mono-\u03c6 model. We consider the mass range where such a model could be interesting based on a reinterpretation of previous analyses [35,36]. The area enclosed by the thick black curve represents the observed exclusion region, while the dashed red lines indicate the expected limits and their \u00b11 and \u00b12 standard deviation (s.d.) ranges. The thin black lines show the effect of the theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross section. The blue star at m \u03c6 , m \u03c8 = (1250, 900) GeV indicates the best fit mass point reported in Refs. [35,36]. Signal cross sections are calculated at LO order in \u03b1 S branching fraction. In our analysis, events are selected with a charged-lepton veto, including hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. Hence, only the 25% of events where both LQs decay to t\u03bd are considered to set constraints on this model, and the theoretical prediction for this branching fraction is shown as a separate curve in Fig. 16 (lower). Table 9 summarizes the limits on the masses of the LQs excluded for the considered scenarios. These results extend the constraints on LQ masses by up to about 200 GeV      with respect to the limits of Ref.",

            "text": "This paper presents the results of two related searches for phenomena beyond the standard model using events with jets and large values of the kinematic variable M T2 . The first is an inclusive search, while the second requires in addition disappearing tracks. The measurements are based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2016-2018 with the CMS detector, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 . No significant deviations from the standard model expectations are observed. Limits on pair-produced gluinos and squarks are established in the context of supersymmetry models conserving R-parity. The inclusive M T2 search probes gluino masses up to 2250 GeV and the lightest neutralino\u03c7 0 1 masses up to 1525 GeV, as well as light-flavor, bottom, and top squark masses up to 1710, 1240, and 1200 GeV, respectively, and\u03c7 0 1 masses up to 870, 700, and 580 GeV in each respective scenario. In models with a long-lived chargino\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , where the gluinos and squarks decay with equal probability to\u03c7 0 1 ,\u03c7 + 1 , and \u03c7 \u2212 1 , the search looking in addition for disappearing tracks probes gluino masses up to 2460 GeV and\u03c7 0 1 masses up to 2000 GeV, as well as light-flavor (top) squark masses up to 2090 (1660) GeV and\u03c7 0 1 masses up to 1650 (1210) GeV. A resonantly produced colored scalar state \u03c6 decaying to a massive Dirac fermion \u03c8 and a quark has recently been proposed as an explanation of an excess in data identified in regions with low jet multiplicities, based on previous results by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. From the inclusive M T2 search, mass limits as high as 1660 and 925 GeV are obtained for \u03c6 and \u03c8, respectively, and an upper limit on the product of the cross section and branching fraction of about 0.6 pb with a local significance of 1.1 standard deviations is observed for the previously reported best fit point m \u03c6 , m \u03c8 = (1250, 900) GeV. The inclusive M T2 search is also used to constrain models of scalar and vector leptoquark (LQ) pair production with the LQ decaying to a neutrino and a top, bottom, or light-flavor quark. A vector LQ decaying with equal branching fraction to t\u03bd and b\u03c4 has been proposed as part of an explanation of recent flavor anomalies. In such a model, LQ masses below 1550 GeV are excluded assuming the Yang-Mills case with coupling \u03ba = 1, or 1225 GeV in the minimal coupling case \u03ba = 0. The results presented in this paper extend the mass limits of the previous version of the CMS inclusive M T2 search, using a subset of the present data, by hundreds of GeV. In most of the cases, the results obtained are the most stringent constraints to date.   ",
