A na\u00efve counting rule for light vector mesons predicts the longitudinal-polarization fraction to be f L \u223c 1 \u2212 O(m 2 V /m 2 B ) in such decays [2]. However, in loop-dominated modes such as B \u2192 \u03c6K * [3], the f L values are found to differ significantly from this prediction. In contrast, tree-dominated decays, e.g., B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 seem to follow the expected pattern [4]. The polarization puzzle is a prime motivation for measurements in other B \u2192 V V decays to test predictions of the QCD factorization and perturbative QCD approach. The sensitivity to f L is obtained by considering the decay process in the helicity basis.",

To suppress these events, a neural network [23] is employed by combining the following four quantities: a Fisher discriminant formed from 16 modified Fox-Wolfram moments [24], the cosine of the angle between the momentum of signal B candidate and the z axis in the CM frame, the separation along the z axis between the vertex of the signal B and that of the recoil B, and the recoil B's flavortagging information [25]. To reconstruct the decay vertex of the recoil B, the tracks not associated with the signal B are used. The training and optimization of the neural network are accomplished with signal and continuum MC events.

In this estimation, we assume the K * helicity angle distributions for f L = 0 and f L = 1 in the K\u03c0K * decay to be the same as those of our signal decay. We vary the amplitude and phase of the interference term and the fractions of f L = 0 and f L = 1 components of K\u03c0K * from 0 to 1. We assign the resulting shifts as the systematic uncertainties after refitting with this modified function.",

We assign an uncertainty on the absolute scale of the reconstruction efficiency due to the limited signal MC statistics. The uncertainty due to calibration factors to correct for the difference between data and simulations is obtained by varying those factors by their errors. We assign an uncertainty due to the different continuum suppression efficiencies at C N B = \u22120.5 in data and MC by using the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K * + control sample.
