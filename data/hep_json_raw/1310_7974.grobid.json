The polarized gluon and quark / antiquark measurements using jet and W boson production at RHIC have been formulated as key milestones of the US Nuclear Physics program. A recent global analysis provides for the first time evidence of a non-zero value of the gluon polarization 0.2 0.05 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.1 +0.06 \u22120.07 , i.e. of similar magnitude as the total quark spin contribution to the proton spin [1]. The analysis of data in 2009 using for the first time collisions of polarized protons at \u221a s = 500 GeV established a novel scheme to probe the quark flavor structure using W boson production. Data taken in 2012 suggest a large asymmetry of the spin contribution of anti-u quarks and anti-d quarks similar to the large and well-known  Figure 1.

            "text": "The gluon polarization program is based on the measurement of various probes, such as inclusive jet production and di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC using the STAR experiment. The full exploitation of the STAR Barrel and Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC / EEMC) is crucial for this analysis effort. Both the first measurement at STAR of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for inclusive jet production [2] and updates with higher precision [3,4] along with the first neutral pion measurement [5] have been published. Precision measurements of inclusive jet production [6] along with the first significant di-jet measurements [7] have been presented suggesting a statistically non-zero gluon spin contribution to the proton spin at the level of 0.2 0.05 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.1 +0.06 \u22120.07 , i.e. of similar magnitude as the total quark spin contribution to the proton spin. The measurement of the gluon polarization through inclusive measurements such as jet production and \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 production was the prime focus of the physics analysis program of the Run 3/4 and Run 5 data samples as well as the Run 6 and Run 9 data samples. The sensitivity of those inclusive measurements to the underlying gluon polarization in high-energy polarized proton-proton collisions has been discussed in detail in [8,9,10]. The 2006 inclusive jet cross-section measurement is shown in Figure 1 (a) [11]. Good agreement is found between data and full NLO calculations taking into account corrections for underlying event and hadronization effects. Figure 1 (b) shows the most recent STAR preliminary result of A LL for inclusive jet production as a function of p T based on the 2006 and 2009 data sample. The 2006 analysis has been published [4]. The 2009 data fall in-between the GRSV-STD (\u2206G = 1 0 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.4) [12] and DSSV (\u2206G = 1 0 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.0) [13] NLO calculations for A LL . The DSSV fit result was constrained by the 2005 [3] and 2006 [4] data. The 2009 result suggests a larger gluon polarization than the one suggested by DSSV, driven by the low-p T region. Prior to a full global analysis incorporating the 2009 result, a first step to quantify the impact of the 2009 result has been made by W. Vogelsang et al. [14]. This  study suggests a non-zero gluon polarization at the level of 0.2 0.05 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.13 and thus of similar magnitude as the quark spin contribution to the proton spin. Di-jet production at STAR will allow a better constraint of the underlying event kinematics to extract the shape of the gluon polarization in a global analysis [15]. The invariant di-jet mass is proportional to the sum of the partonic Bjorken-x values, x 1 + x 2 , whereas the pseudo-rapidity sum \u03b7 3 + \u03b7 4 is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the partonic Bjorken-x values, log(x 1 /x 2 ).",

The 2009 di-jet A LL measurement also suggests a larger gluon polarization scenario than those suggested by DSSV [13]. The data fall in-between the GRSV-STD [12] and DSSV [13] polarized PDFs used for a full NLO calculation similar to the inclusive-jet result shown in Figure 1. All current PHENIX and STAR A LL measurements taken together, in comparison to different NLO perturbative QCD predictions for A LL , provide a consistent picture which rules out a large gluon polarization scenario. At the same time, data taken in Run 9 provide the first evidence for a non-zero gluon spin contribution to the proton spin. A critical aspect to extract the gluon polarization of the proton is to perform a global analysis of several A LL measurements obtained from the PHENIX and STAR collaborations, taking into account a constraint of polarized PDFs at high Bjorken-x values by several polarized fixed-target DIS experiments. Figure 4 shows the impact of the Run 9 and future data sets on the polarized gluon distribution function [1]. The Run 9 result suggests a statistically non-zero value of the gluon polarization at the level of 0.2 0.05 \u2206g dx (Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) = 0.1 +0.06 \u22120.07 which is of similar magnitude as the total quark spin contribution itself.

A theoretical framework has been developed to describe inclusive lepton (l) production, p + p \u2192 W \u00b1 + X \u2192 l \u00b1 + X, that can be directly compared with experimental measurements using constraints on the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the final-state leptons [19,20]. This development profits from a rich history of hadroproduction of weak bosons at the CERN SPS and the FNAL Tevatron and provides a firm basis to use W production as a new high-energy probe in polarized p + p collisions [21]. The subsequent analyses of both the W boson asymmetry and cross-section measurements have been published [22,23]. The first cross-section measurement is shown in Figure 7. Data taken in 2012 suggest a large asymmetry of the spin contribution of anti-u quarks and anti-d quarks similar to the large and well-known asymmetry between the momentum distributions of anti-u quarks and anti-d quarks [24]. An upgrade of the STAR forward tracking system was carried out with the installation of the Forward GEM Tracker (FGT) in 2012 prior to the 2013 data taking period [25]. This upgrade will improve the ability of the STAR tracking system to track high-energetic electrons (positrons) from W \u2212(+) -boson decays at forward acceptance enhancing the sensitivity to quark / antiquark polarizations. The first published W measurement at mid-rapidity using the Run 9 data sample is based on L = 12 pb \u22121 [22]. This achievements marks a major milestone of the RHIC Spin program, in particular the ability of the STAR detector system to establish the reconstruction of W bosons, both for a cross-section and asymmetry measurement. The STAR detector systems used in this analysis are the STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) and the STAR Electromagnetic Endcap Calorimeter (EEMC). Only their tower response has been taken into account. The BEMC was used to measure the transverse energy, E T , of e \u00b1 . The suppression of QCD background by several orders of magnitude was based on the TPC, BEMC and EEMC. The STAR TPC plays a critical role to provide an efficient way for high-p T charge-sign discrimination of electron / positron track candidates. The reconstruction of W boson events is well established including the treatment of background. This will be the basis for future measurements, in particular the large Run 13 data sample of L 300 pb \u22121 . The critical new step is the development of tracking software concerning the charge-sign separation of high-p T electrons (positrons) from W \u2212(+) -decays for 1 < |\u03b7| < 2 using   Figure 6.

Any measurements beyond this first result will focus on making \u03b7 e dependent asymmetry measurements at midrapidity together with measurements at forward and backward pseudorapidities constraining the polarization ofd and\u016b quarks. A major step forward has been achieved with the release of preliminary results based on the Run 12 data sample shown in Figure 5 (b) [24]. While the W + asymmetry result is consistent with the DSSV prediction [13], the W \u2212 asymmetry result suggests a larger\u016b quark polarization. This is indeed the finding from a full global analysis incorporating the Run 12 asymmetry results. Figure 8 shows the impact on the polarized u and d antiquark distribution functions [1]. Future RHIC W asymmetry measurements shown in Figure 8 (a) will have a substantial impact in comparison to a global fit result which does not include any W asymmetry results from RHIC by approximately a factor of 2 compared to the original DSSV fit uncertainties [13,27]  (Figure 8   Figure 8.

It is the hope that these findings can be confronted with Lattice QCD calculations. The ground work has been laid by X. Ji et al. in a recent paper [28,29,30]. Results of W boson production suggest a large asymmetry in the QCD sea, i.e. the difference of the polarization of anti-u and anti-d quarks. Such a scenario has been discussed in the past in the context of a valence scenario by the GRSV group [12] and in particular by J. Soffer [31,32]. Recent lattice QCD calculations presented by H. Lin in [33] point to the same finding. The experimental goal of the RHIC Spin program is",
