However, despite many years of experimental efforts, none of these gluonic states have been established unambiguously. Possible reasons for this include the mixing between glueballs and conventional mesons, the lack of solid information on the glueball production mechanism, and the lack of knowledge about glueball decay properties.",

            "text": "Of these difficulties, from the experimental point of view, the most outstanding obstacle is the isolation of glueballs from various quarkonium states. Fortunately, there is a class of glueballs with three gluons and quantum numbers incompatible with quark-antiquark bound states, called oddballs, that are free of this conundrum. The quantum numbers of such glueballs include J P C = 0 \u2212\u2212 , 0 +\u2212 , 1 \u2212+ , 2 +\u2212 , 3 \u2212+ , and so on. Among oddballs, special attention should be paid to the 0 \u2212\u2212 state (G 0 \u2212\u2212 ), since it is relatively light and can be produced in the decays of vector quarkonium or quarkoniumlike states. Two 0 \u2212\u2212 oddballs are predicted using QCD sum rules [2] with masses of (3.81 \u00b1 0.12) GeV/c 2 and (4.33 \u00b1 0.13) GeV/c 2 , while the lowest-lying state calculated using distinct bottom-up holographic models of QCD [3] has a mass of 2.80 GeV/c 2 .",

All the parent particles in the above processes are copiously produced in the Belle experiment, and may decay to the oddballs with modest rates. Since the widths are unknown, we report an investigation of the 0 \u2212\u2212 glueballs with different assumed widths. The \u03c7 c1 is reconstructed via its decays into \u03b3J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and \u2113 = e or \u00b5, f 1 (1285) via \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and \u03c9 via \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 with \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.

Here, \u221a s is the center-of-mass (C.M.) energy of the colliding e + e \u2212 system. The data were collected with the Belle detector [5,6] operated at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [7,8]. Large Monte Carlo (MC) samples of all of the investigated glueball modes are generated with EVTGEN [9] to determine signal line-shapes and efficiencies. The angular distribution for \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 b1 is simulated assuming a pure E1 transition (dN/d cos \u03b8 \u03b3 \u221d 1 \u2212 1 3 cos 2 \u03b8 \u03b3 [10], where \u03b8 \u03b3 is the polar angle of the \u03a5(2S) radiative photon in the e + e \u2212 C.M. frame), and uniform phase space is used for the \u03c7 b1 decays. We use the uniform phase-space decay model for other decays as well. Note that G 0 \u2212\u2212 inclusive decays are modelled using PYTHIA [11].

We require the photon energy from \u03c7 c1 radiative decays in the \u03b3J/\u03c8 C.M. frame to satisfy 0.36 GeV < E * \u03b3 < 0.41 GeV to suppress the non-\u03c7 c1 backgrounds.

We perform a mass-constrained kinematic fit to the surviving \u03b7 candidates and require \u03c7 2 < 10. A clear K 0 S signal is seen in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution and such backgrounds are removed by requiring that the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass not fall between 0.475 and 0.515 GeV/c 2 .

Since the f 1 (1285) decays into \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 primarily via the a 0 (980)\u03c0 intermediate state, we require either M(\u03b7\u03c0 + ) or M(\u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 ) to be in a \u00b160 MeV/c 2 mass window centered on the a 0 (980) nominal mass.

No evident signal is found at three theoretically-predicted masses in the processes\u03a5(1S, 2S) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 + G 0 \u2212\u2212 , \u03a5(1S, 2S) \u2192 f 1 (1285) + G 0 \u2212\u2212 , \u03c7 b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + G 0 \u2212\u2212 ,and \u03c7 b1 \u2192 \u03c9 + G 0 \u2212\u2212 and 90% C.L. upper limits are set on the branching fractions for these processes. Figures 8 and 17 show the upper limits on the branching fractions as a function of the 0 \u2212\u2212 glueball width. The results presented in this article do not strongly depend on the spin-parity assumption of the glueballs. We also scan with fits across the mass regions up to 6.0 GeV/c 2 for all of the modes under study. All the signal significances are less than 3\u03c3 except for \u03a5(1S) \u2192 f 1 (1285) + G 0 \u2212\u2212 , where the maximum signal significance is 3.7\u03c3 at 3.92 GeV/c 2 . It should be noted that we report here the local statistical significances without considering the lookelsewhere effect, which will largely reduce the significances. As we do not observe signals in any of the modes under study, the upper limits can be applied almost directly to the glueballs in this mass region with the same width and opposite spin parity and charge-conjugate parity, such as J P C = (0, 1, 2, 3) +\u2212 and (1, 2, 3) \u2212\u2212 [23].
