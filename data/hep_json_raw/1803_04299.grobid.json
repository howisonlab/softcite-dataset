            "text": "Weak decays of charmed baryon provide useful information for understanding the interplay of weak and strong interactions, complementary to the information obtained from charmed mesons. The lightest charmed baryon + c is the cornerstone of the whole charmed baryon spectroscopy, and the measurement of the properties of + c provides essential input for studying heavier charmed baryons, such as singly and doubly charmed baryons [1,2] and b-baryons [3]. However, theory development in describing the + c has been slow [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11], mostly due to limited understanding of the nontrivial non-factorizable effects involved, especially the W -exchange process. This is very different from the cases of the D (s) meson decays, where the W -exchange amplitude is suppressed by color and helicity symmetries. Therefore, clean experimental measurements of the W -exchange-only process in + c decays play an important role in the identification of the nonfactorizable contribution in different theoretical calculations [12].",

            "text": "The Cabibbo-favored decays + c \u2192 0 K + and (1530) 0 K + proceed only through the W -exchange process, as depicted in Fig. 1. These two modes are typical + c decays to the baryon octet and decuplet states, respectively. In these two decay modes, large cancellation between different matrix elements occur in both S-and P -wave decays, making theoretical predictions very difficult [13]. Several model predictions of the branching fractions (B) for + c \u2192 ( * )0 K + (here and in the following, * 0 is used to denote the (1530) 0 ) are listed in Table 1. They show large variations from each other; the predicted B( + c \u2192 0 K + ) fall in the range of [1.0, 3.6] \u00d7 10 \u22123 [4,6,10,14,15], while the calculations for B( + c \u2192 * 0 K + ) give three distinct results with oneorder-of-magnitude difference [4,16,17]. In experiment, these two modes were studied by the CLEO [18] and ARGUS [19] collaborations more than 20 years ago. Both collaborations directly measured the relative decay rates compared to B( + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ), as given in Table 1. Correcting for the branching fraction of the refer- c , and the remaining phase space does not allow any additional hadrons, hence a double-tag technique [27] can be employed. This technique does not require a measurement of the luminosity and knowledge of the production cross section, thus providing a model-independent measurement of B( + c \u2192 ( * )0 K + ). First, we select a 'single-tag' (ST) sample of \u00af \u2212 c candidates by reconstructing the \u00af \u2212 c exclusively in one of 12 hadronic decays, as described later. Then, we search for + c \u2192 ( * )0 K + candidates in the system recoiling against the ST side; the collection of selected candidates is referred to as the double-tag (DT) sample. In this analysis, we only detect one K + in the DT side and deduce the presence of a ( * )0 in the final state from four-momentum conservation. The absolute B of + c \u2192 ( * )0 K + is then determined from the efficiency-corrected ratio of DT yields to ST yields.",

The components of the apparatus are a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight (TOF) system, a 6240-cell CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a superconducting solenoid providing 1.0 T magnetic field aligned with the beam axis, and a muon counter with resistive plate chambers as the active element. The momentum resolution for charged tracks in the MDC is 0.5% at a transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. The photon energy resolution for 1 GeV/c photos in the EMC is 2.5% in the barrel region and 5.0% in the end-cap region. The combined information of the ionization energy deposited in the MDC and the flight time measured by the TOF is used to perform particle identification (PID) for charged tracks. More details about the design and performance of the BESIII detector are given in Ref. [26].",

More information related to PID in BESIII can be found elsewhere [11]. Clusters in the EMC not associated with any charged track are identified as photon candidates if they satisfy the following requirements: the deposited energy is required to be larger than Candidates for K 0 S and \u00af are formed by combining two oppositely charged tracks of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and p\u03c0 + , respectively. For these two tracks, their distances of closest approaches to the IP must be within \u00b120 cm along the electron beam direction. No distance constraints in the transverse plane are required. The two daughter tracks are constrained to originate from a common decay vertex by requiring the \u03c7 2 of the vertex fit to be less than 100. Furthermore, the decay vertex is required to be separated from the IP by a distance greater than twice the fitted vertex resolution. In this procedure, as the combinational backgrounds have been highly suppressed, the charged pions are not subjected to the PID requirement described above, to have the optimal signal significance. The vertex fitted momenta of the daughter particles are used in the further analysis. We impose the requirements 487 < M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) < 511 MeV/c 2 and 1111 < M(p\u03c0 + ) < 1121 MeV/c 2 for K 0 S and \u00af candidates.

The above requirements on the invariant masses correspond to approximately \u00b13 standard deviations around the nominal masses [24].

In addition, pK 0 S \u03c0 0 candidates satisfying 1170 < M(p\u03c0 0 ) < 1200 MeV/c 2 are excluded to suppress the backgrounds with a \u00af \u2212 in the final state.

The measured B( + c \u2192 (1530) 0 K + ) favors the calculation in Ref. [4], while B( + c \u2192 0 K + ) in Ref. [4] has 4\u03c3 discrepancy from experimental result. This indicates that our results are essential to calibrate the W -exchange diagram amplitudes in these theoretical approaches.",

Apart from the poor precision of the two B's, the experimental result for B( + c \u2192 0 K + ) exceeds the upper end of the predictions by almost 2\u03c3 . Hence, an absolute and more precise determination of these B's is an important input for the modelization of the hadronic decays of charmed baryons. In this Letter, we present a study of the W -exchange-only decays + c \u2192 0 K + and (1530) 0 K + , based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb \u22121 [25] collected with the BESIII detector [26] at the center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 4.6 GeV.
