            "text": "The NEMO-3 experiment at the Modane Underground Laboratory has investigated the double\u03b2 decay of 48 Ca. Using 5.25 yr of data recorded with a 6.99 g sample of 48 Ca, approximately 150 double-\u03b2 decay candidate events have been selected with a signal-to-background ratio greater than 3. The half-life for the two-neutrino double-\u03b2 decay of 48 Ca has been measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [6.4 +0.7 \u22120.6 (stat.) +1.2 \u22120.9 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 yr. A search for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay of 48 Ca yields a null result and a corresponding lower limit on the half-life is found to be T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.0 \u00d7 10 22 yr at 90% confidence level, translating into an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of m \u03b2\u03b2 < 6.0 \u2212 26 eV, with the range reflecting different nuclear matrix element calculations. Limits are also set on models involving Majoron emission and right-handed currents. ",

            "text": "Neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) is the only feasible way of experimentally determining the Majorana or Dirac nature of light neutrinos. In the event that neutrinos are Majorana particles, this process may provide one of the most promising methods for measuring their absolute mass as well as the possible presence of additional CP-violating phases (see for example [1]). The corresponding two-neutrino decay mode (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) does not violate lepton number conservation and is allowed in the standard model. This mode has been observed for several isotopes and provides valuable inputs to nuclear matrix element (NME) calculations [2,3]. However no clear evidence for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 has been established to date, with the best half-life limits in the range 10 24\u221225 yr [4][5][6][7][8]. 48 Ca is a particularly interesting nucleus with which to search for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay since it has the highest kinetic energy release Q \u03b2\u03b2 = (4267.98 \u00b1 0.32) keV of any known double-\u03b2 decaying isotope [9]. This Q \u03b2\u03b2 -value is significantly above the bulk of naturally occurring radioactive backgrounds and, moreover, ensures a favourable phase space which enhances the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate. However 48 Ca has a low natural abundance of 0.187% and is difficult to enrich. Recent calculations also indicate a relative suppression of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 NMEs for 48 Ca compared to other isotopes [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].",

            "text": "The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay mode of 48 Ca was first discovered in the Hoover Dam TPC experiment, employing approximately 14 g of isotope [18]. With a sample of approximately 100 events, the half-life was measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [4.3 +2.4 \u22121.1 (stat) \u00b1 1.4(syst)] \u00d7 10 19 yr. A subsequent measurement in the TGV planar germanium array experiment using 1 g of isotope yielded T 2\u03bd 1/2 = 4.2 +3.3 \u22121.3 \u00d710 19 yr based on only 5 events in the region of interest [19]. Both of these measurements are in agreement with the shell model prediction of T 2\u03bd 1/2 = 3.7 \u00d7 10 19 yr [20]. Shell model calculations are expected to be the most reliable for 48 Ca. Nevertheless recent predictions for the two-neutrino half-life span a range of (2.0 \u2212 4.5) \u00d7 10 19 yr [12,[21][22][23]. Other NME schemes are less well suited to this isotope, although there is a QRPA prediction of 4.7 \u00d7 10 19 yr [24].",

Electrons pass through 50 cm wide wire chambers on each side of the source foils, containing in total 6180 Geiger cells operating in a gas mixture comprising helium with 4% ethanol quencher, 1% argon and 0.15% water vapour. Surrounding the tracker is the calorimeter, consisting of 1940 plastic scintillators coupled to low radioactivity photomultipliers. A copper coil mounted outside the calorimeter generates a 25 G solenoidal magnetic field and beyond that 165 tons of iron, in addition to borated water, paraffin and wood, are used to shield the inner detector from external radioactivity. Approximately 95% of 1 MeV positrons are rejected by determining the track curvature, and 1 MeV electrons are measured in the calorimeter with an energy resolution (FWHM) ranging from 14.1% to 17.7% and a timing resolution \u03c3 t \u2248 250 ps. A cylindrical coordinate system (R, \u03c6, Z) is used, with the Z\u2212axis pointing upwards, parallel to the source foil and tracker wires.",

With an enrichment fraction of (73.2 \u00b1 1.6)%, this corresponds to 6.99 g of 48 Ca.

Isolated calorimeter hits that have no energy deposits in neighbouring calorimeter cells and that are matched to reconstructed tracks have their energies corrected for the track impact position and are stored as electron candidates.

One of the most difficult distributions to simulate accurately is the opening angle of the two electrons in double-\u03b2 like event topologies, which requires accurate modelling not only of electron scattering in the source material but also the performance of the reconstruction algorithms for tracks with varying spatial separations. Separating two-electron events into exclusive samples comprising events with both electrons on the same side (SS) or opposite side (OS) of the source foil gives rise to fitted activities that are different from the combined sample by \u221214% (SS) and +11% (OS) respectively. Although this discrepancy has a statistical significance of only 1.2\u03c3, it is included here as an asymmetric systematic uncertainty on the half-life obtained from the inclusive 2e sample.",

The existence of right-handed weak currents would lead to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays with different electron kinematics from the neutrino exchange mechanism. The summed energy spectra do not differ significantly from the light neutrino exchange mode, giving consistent limits on the number of observed events.

Given the relatively low statistics and high level of background at the lower end of the spectrum studied in this work, only the n = 1 case is considered. The upper limit on the number of observed events is 9.35 at 90% C.L., which is combined with a detection efficiency of 13.4% to give a lower half-life limit of 4.6 \u00d7 10 21 yr. This result improves on the previously published best limit of 7.2 \u00d7 10 20 yr [44], obtained with data from [45]. An upper limit on the coupling between the \u03bd e and the Majoron of g ee < (1.0\u22124.3)\u00d710 \u22124 is extracted from the half-life limit using the phase space factor from [43] and matrix elements from [11][12][13][14][15][16][17].",

A larger and purer sample of \u03b2\u03b2 events has been selected than in previous experiments and the half-life for the standard model twoneutrino double-\u03b2 decay mode has been measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [6.4 +0.7 \u22120.6 (stat.) +1.2 \u22120.9 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 yr. This measured half-life is consistent with previous experimental measurements but has significantly smaller uncertainties. Note that this result differs from and supercedes a preliminary measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life for 48 Ca previously reported by the NEMO-3 collaboration [2,3]. The change in reported half-life is due primarily to a modified description of the source geometry following the decommissioning of the NEMO-3 detector. The half-life reported in this work is longer than suggested by shellmodel calculations, although the significance of this discrepancy is only at the level of 2\u03c3.",

Further investigation of the double-\u03b2 decay of 48 Ca using a similar experimental technique but with larger exposures would therefore lead to improved limits on 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 as well as provide a more precise measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life.
