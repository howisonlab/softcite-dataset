The new results, obtained with a fine energy and angular binning, increase the existing quantity of \u03c0 0 photoproduction data by \u223c 47%. Owing to the unprecedented statistical accuracy and the full angular coverage, the results are sensitive to high partial-wave amplitudes. This is demonstrated by the decomposition of the differential cross sections in terms of Legendre polynomials and by further comparison to model predictions. A new solution of the SAID partial-wave analysis obtained after adding the new data into the fit is presented.",

The data with the 1557-MeV beam were taken in the first half of 2013 (Run-I) and those with the 1604-MeV beam in the second half of 2014 (Run-II). Bremsstrahlung photons, produced by the beam electrons in a 10-\u00b5m Cu radiator and collimated by a 4mm-diameter Pb collimator, were incident on a 10-cmlong liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) target located in the center of the CB. In Run-I with the 1557-MeV electron beam, the energies of the incident photons were analyzed up to 1448 MeV by detecting the postbremsstrahlung electrons in the Glasgow tagged-photon spectrometer (Glasgow tagger) [18][19][20]. The uncertainty in the energy of the tagged photons is mainly determined by the number of tagger focal-plane detectors in combination with the energy of the MAMI electron beam used in the experiments. Increasing the MAMI energy results in increasing both the energy range covered by the spectrometer and the corresponding uncertainty in E \u03b3 . For the MAMI energy of 1557 MeV and the Glasgow tagger, such an uncertainty was about \u00b12 MeV. The systematic uncertainty in the absolute value of E \u03b3 , which is dominated by the energy calibration of the tagger, was about 0.5 MeV [20]. More details on the tagger energy calibration and uncertainties in the energies can be found in Ref. [21].",

The uncertainty of the EPT in E \u03b3 due to the width of its focal-plane detectors was about \u00b11.6 MeV, with a similar value (i.e. \u223c 1.6 MeV) in the systematic uncertainty in E \u03b3 due to the EPT energy calibration. The energy calibration of the EPT is based only on the simulation of electron tracing, using measured magnetic-field maps. The correctness of this calibration, as well as its uncertainty, was checked by measuring the position of the \u03b7 \u2032 threshold, E \u03b3 \u2248 1447 MeV.",

The first source of background was due to interactions of incident photons in the windows of the target cell. The subtraction of this background was based on the analysis of data samples that were taken with an empty (no liquid hydrogen) target. The weight for the subtraction of the empty-target spectra was taken as a ratio of the photon-beam fluxes for the data samples with the full and the empty target. A second background was caused by random coincidences of the tagger counts with the experimental trigger; its subtraction was carried out by using event samples for which all coincidences were random (see Refs.

Figure 1(a) shows the experimental cos \u03b8 distribution for E \u03b3 = 318 MeV (W=1215 MeV), which is obtained after subtracting the random and the emptytarget backgrounds. Since this energy bin is close to the \u2206(1232)3/2 + maximum, the statistical uncertainties in this distribution, based on 8 \u00d7 10 6 events, are very small (\u223c 0.2%). Figure 1(b) shows the corresponding angular acceptance, which is greater than 80% for the central range of \u03c0 0 production angles. The resulting \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross section for E \u03b3 = 318 MeV is depicted in Fig. 1(c). It is also compared to the prediction from the partial-wave analysis (PWA) by SAID [23] with its CM12 [24] solution (shown by a solid line). The experimental data points lie slightly above the phenomenological prediction, but their angular dependence is very close to it. Because all modern PWAs give very similar predictions for the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross section at the \u2206(1232)3/2 + maximum, the present results in this region do not contradict any of them. differential cross section. Since the shape of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross sections in this region changes rapidly with energy, the main goal of the present work was to measure it with the finest energy binning. Figure 2(b) shows that the angular acceptance drops for the very forward angles. At these energies, this occurs as many \u03c0 0 mesons produced at forward angles have both their decay photons going into TAPS, and such events do not pass the trigger requirements. The resulting differential cross section, plotted in Fig. 2(c), demonstrates again a quite reasonable agreement with the SAID CM12 solution [24]. Figure 3 shows the cos \u03b8 distributions for E \u03b3 = 1512 MeV (W=1928 MeV) from the data taken in Run-II. Despite the large quantity of the experimental events (9 \u00d7 10 5 ), a very low, and even zero, acceptance for the very forward and backward angles, caused by the trigger, did not allow the first two and the last two cos \u03b8 bins to be measured. However, the remaining 26 data points of the differential cross section lie close to the prediction from SAID CM12 [24].",

Figure 4 illustrates self-consistency of the results for the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross sections obtained by the A2 Collaboration in three different experiments. The results for the lowest energy, E \u03b3 = 218 MeV, taken in Run-I are compared in Fig. 4(a) with similar results obtained in the A2 experiment (A2-2008) with the Glasgow tagger and MAMI energy of 855 MeV [25]. As seen, the agreement of the two independent measurements is fairly good for both the absolute values and the angular dependence. Despite a general agreement, there are some discrepancies between the two sets of results, which cannot be explained by their statistical uncertainties. In our opinion, such discrepancies could be caused by several factors. There was a significant difference in the trigger of the two experiments and in the energy resolution of the calorimeters, as the experiment with the EPT (Run-II) was made with a much higher MAMI electron current. A poorer energy resolution in Run-II resulted in a larger smearing of the cos \u03b8 angular dependence. Another possible explana- tion is a slight mismatch in the energy calibrations of the two different tagged-photon spectrometers. Overall, the average systematic uncertainty in the differential cross sections due to the resolution in the c.m. \u03b8 and possible imperfections in the angular acceptance was estimated to be 2% for the results of Run-I. The corresponding systematic uncertainty for the results of Run-II is at least twice as high.",

The resulting total cross sections are plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of the c.m. energy W along with earlier A2 results obtained for energies up to E \u03b3 = 444 MeV (W=1309 MeV) [25] and results from Ref. [26], obtained for energies up to E \u03b3 = 790 MeV (W=1537 MeV), and from Ref. [28], obtained for energies above E \u03b3 = 300 MeV (W=1201 MeV). The latter data have no full angular coverage; they were obtained with extrapolating experimental differential cross sections into forward and backward angles by using the corresponding PWA results. For completeness, the data at higher energies are also compared in Fig. 6(b) to the SAID solution CM12 [24], shown by a magenta dashed line. As seen in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the present results are in good agreement, within the total uncertainties (calculated by adding the statistical and the overall systematic uncertainty in quadrature), with the earlier A2 results and in general agreement with the most recent experimental data and SAID CM2 solution based on fitting previous data, even if they do not have the full angular coverage.",

Three sets of predictions shown in this figure correspond to PWAs (namely, SAID CM12 [24], MAID2007 [30], and Bonn-Gatchina BG2014-02 [31]) based on fitting previous data. The fourth set of curves comes from SAID PR15 solution obtained after adding the present data points into the SAID fit. Compared to the SAID solution CM12, the new fit PR15 also involves the data added to obtain SAID DU13 solution [5] and other most recent polarization data from CBELSA/TAPS [9,10] and A2 at MAMI [11]. As seen, all three the previous PWAs are very close to each  /dp values (including information on the total \u03c7 2 from Eq.

Differences between the PWAs themselves as well as between the PWAs and the data points increase, especially for the MAID2007 solution, at energies that are away from the \u2206(1232)3/2 + peak. Then all the PWAs and the data points become closer again in the second and the third resonance regions. The largest difference between the present data and the three previous PWAs is observed for the MAID2007 solution; this could be explained by the fact that many of the most recent data sets were not available at the time when the MAID2007 solution was released.",

As seen, the peaks corresponding to the first, the second, and the third resonance region are clearly evident in the excitation function for each \u03c0 0 production angle. The experimental distributions are also compared to the three previous PWA solutions (SAID CM12 [24], MAID2007 [30], and BG2014-02 [31]) and the new SAID PR15 solution. For a better comparison in the energy range away from the \u2206(1232)3/2 + peak, all distributions are also plotted after rescaling by a factor 5. The comparison demonstrates that the largest discrepancies are seen for the very forward and backward production angles.",

An example of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross section near this dip (namely, at W = 1380 MeV) is shown in Fig 10(a). This effect, caused by the nearly complete cancellation between different contributions to the production cross section, is even better seen in the results of the new SAID PR15 solution, shown in Fig 10(b) by a blue solid line for cos \u03b8 = \u22121 (or \u03b8 = 180 \u2022 ). It is interesting that a very similar cancellation in the very backward \u03c0 0 production angles was observed in the charge-exchange reaction \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n at the same energy range. The SAID WI08 solution [33] (rescaled by a factor 10 \u22123 ) for \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n at \u03b8 = 180 \u2022 is plotted in Fig 10(b) by a red dashed line. In contrast, the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 + n reaction, depicted for the SAID PR15 solution by a black dashed line, has no such feature. Unfortunately, the quality and the angular coverage of the existing \u03b3n \u2192 \u03c0 0 n data do not allow a reliable prediction for very backward production \u03c0 0 angles in this energy range [34].",

As previously discussed, the effect from the angular-dependent systematic uncertainties should be considered, especially for the \u2206(1232)3/2 + energy region. To estimate the impact from these uncertainties, the values of the differential cross section for each angular bin were randomly shifted within the uncertainty magnitude (2%), followed by a new Legendre-polynomial fit. Such a procedure was then repeated several times, and the average spread of the fit results for each A j was considered as its systematic uncertainty caused by the angular-dependent systematic uncertainties in the differential cross sections. The systematic uncertainties in A j , obtained from the fits with j max = 10, are depicted by a black histogram at the bottom of each plot in Fig. 12, clearly peaking at the position of \u2206(1232)3/2 + . In this region, the magnitudes of the systematic uncertainties in A j at high orders are very close to the magnitudes of A j themselves.

            "text": "New measurements of \u03c0 0 photoproduction on the proton have been conducted with the A2 tagged-photon facilities at energies provided by the Mainz Microtron, MAMI C, with a maximum electron-beam energy of 1.6 GeV. The differential cross sections, obtained with a fine energy and angular binning, increase the existing quantity of \u03c0 0 photoproduction data by \u223c 47%. A new solution PR15 of the SAID partial-wave analysis obtained after adding the new data into the fit is presented. The magnitudes of \u03c7 2 /dp obtained for this solution indicate that the new \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p data are consistent with the existing \u03b3N \u2192 \u03c0N data sets. Owing to the unprecedented statistical accuracy and the full angular coverage, the results are sensitive to high partial-wave amplitudes. This is demonstrated by the decomposition of the differential cross sections in terms of Legendre polynomials and by further comparison to model predictions. The present data are expected to be invaluable for future partial-wave and coupled-channel analyses, which could provide much stronger constraints on the properties of nucleon states known in this energy range and, perhaps, even reveal new resonances. A more detailed analysis of the present \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross sections, combined with results from the A2 Collaboration obtained by measuring polarization observables, is currently in progress and will be published separately.",

A second background was caused by random coincidences of the tagger counts with the experimental trigger; its subtraction was carried out by using event samples for which all coincidences were random (see Refs.[17,22] for more details).For measuring the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross sections, all selected events were divided into 30 equal-width cos \u03b8 bins, covering the full range from -1 to 1, where \u03b8 is the angle between the directions of the outgoing \u03c0 0 and the incident photon in the c.m. frame. Also, the quantity of data collected for \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p was sufficient to obtain statistically accurate differential cross sections for every tagger channel in the energy range from E \u03b3 = 218 MeV to 1120 MeV, providing \u223c 4 MeV binning in E \u03b3 . For higher energies, energy bins were combined in two or more tagger channels.The typical experimental statistics and acceptance are illustrated inFigs. 1, 2, and 3 for different energies and data sets.Figure 1(a)shows the experimental cos \u03b8 distribution for E \u03b3 = 318 MeV (W=1215 MeV), which is obtained after subtracting the random and the emptytarget backgrounds. Since this energy bin is close to the \u2206(1232)3/2 + maximum, the statistical uncertainties in this distribution, based on 8 \u00d7 10 6 events, are very small (\u223c 0.2%).Figure 1(b)shows the corresponding angular acceptance, which is greater than 80% for the central range of \u03c0 0 production angles. The resulting \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross section for E \u03b3 = 318 MeV is depicted inFig. 1(c). It is also compared to the prediction from the partial-wave analysis (PWA) by SAID[23] with its CM12[24] solution (shown by a solid line). The experimental data points lie slightly above the phenomenological prediction, but their angular dependence is very close to it. Because all modern PWAs give very similar predictions for the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p differential cross section at the \u2206(1232)3/2 + maximum, the present results in this region do not contradict any of them.Figure 2(a)shows the experimental cos \u03b8 distribution for E \u03b3 = 1202 MeV (W=1771 MeV), which is near the third resonance region. The statistical uncertainties in this distribution, based on 8.5\u00d710 4 events, are larger but are still sufficient for a reliable analysis of the resulting",
