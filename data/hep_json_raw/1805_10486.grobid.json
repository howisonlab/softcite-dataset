            "text": "The first model independent results obtained by the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 experiment are presented. The data have been collected over 6 annual cycles corresponding to a total exposure of 1.13 t \uf0d7 yr, deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the I.N.F.N. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 apparatus, \u2243 250 kg highly radio-pure NaI(Tl), profits from a second generation high quantum efficiency photomultipliers and of new electronics with respect to DAMA/LIBRA-phase1. The improved experimental configuration has also allowed to lower the software energy threshold. New data analysis strategies are presented. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 data confirm the evidence of a signal that meets all the requirements of the model independent Dark Matter (DM) annual modulation signature, at 9.5 \uf073 C.L. in the energy region (1 -6) keV. In the energy region between 2 and 6 keV, where data are also available from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 (exposure 1.33 t \uf0d7 yr, collected over 14 annual cycles), the achieved C.L. for the full exposure (2.46 t \uf0d7 yr) is 12.9 \uf073; the modulation amplitude of the single-hit scintillation events is: (0.0103 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.0008) cpd/kg/keV, the measured phase is (145 \u00b1 5) d and the measured period is (0.999 \u00b1 0.001) yr, all these values are well in agreement with those expected for DM particles. No systematics or side reaction able to mimic the exploited DM signature (i.e. to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements of the signature), has been found or suggested by anyone throughout some decades thus far.",

            "text": "The origin of the DM annual modulation signature and of its peculiar features is due to the Earth motion with respect to the DM particles constituting the Galactic Dark Halo, so it is not related to terrestrial seasons. In fact, as a consequence of the Earth's revolution around the Sun, which is moving in the Galaxy with respect to the Local Standard of Rest towards the star Vega near the constellation of Hercules, the Earth should be crossed by a larger flux of DM particles around \u2243 2 June and by a smaller one around \u2243 2 December. In the former case, the Earth orbital velocity is summed to that of the solar system with respect to the Galaxy, while in the latter the two velocities are subtracted. The DM annual modulation signature is very distinctive since the effect induced by DM particles must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements: the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function (1) with 1 yr period (2) and a phase that peaks roughly \u2243 2 June (3); this modulation must only be found in a well-defined low energy range, where DM particle induced events can be present (4); it must apply only to those events in which just one detector of many actually \"fires\" (single-hit events), since the DM particle multi-\u00a9 R. Bernabei interaction probability is negligible (5); the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be \u2272 7 % of the constant part of the signal for usually adopted halo distributions (6), but it can be larger in case of some proposed scenarios such as e.g. those in Refs. [52 -56] (even up to \u2243 30 %). Thus this signature is not dependent on the nature of the DM particle, has many peculiarities and, in addition, it allows to test a wide range of parameters in many possible astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics scenarios.",

Moreover, self-controlled computer based processes automatically monitor several parameters, including those from DAQ, and manage the alarms system.

The results of Residuals, cpd/kg/keV the best fits are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 also shows the results of the fit obtained for DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 either including or not DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1, when the period and the phase are kept free in the fitting procedure. As reported in the table, the period and the phase are well compatible with expectations for a DM annual modulation signal. In particular, the phase is consistent with about June 2 nd and is fully consistent with the value independently determined by Maximum Likelihood analysis (see later). For completeness, we recall that a slight energy dependence of the phase could be expected (see e.g. Refs. [35, 55, 56, 58 -60]), providing intriguing information on the nature of Dark Matter candidate and related aspects.",

Thus, again evidence of annual modulation with proper features as required by the DM annual modulation signature is present in the single-hit residuals (events class to which the DM particle induced events belong), while it is absent in the multiple-hit residual rate (event class to which only background events belong). Similar results were also obtained for the two last annual cycles of DAMA/NaI [33] and for DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 [2 -5].

The obtained values are fully in agreement; in fact, the hypothesis that the two sets of modulation amplitudes as a function of the energy belong to same distribution has been verified by \uf063 2 test, obtaining e.g.: \uf063 2 / d.o.f. = 2.5/6 and 40.8/38 for the energy intervals (1 -4) and (1 -20) keV, respectively (\uf044E = 0.5 keV).

In addition to the \uf063 2 test, another independent statistical test has been applied: the run test (see e.g. Ref.

The lower (upper) tail probabilities obtained by the run test are: 70(70), 50(73), 85 (35), 88 (30) and 88(30) %, respectively.

No systematic or side processes able to mimic the signature, i.e. able to simultaneously satisfy all the many peculiarities of the signature and to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude, has been found or suggested by anyone throughout some decades thus far. In particular, arguments related to any possible role of some natural periodical phenomena have been discussed and quantitatively demonstrated to be unable to mimic the signature (see references; e.g. Refs. [7,8]). Thus, on the basis of the exploited signature, the model independent DAMA results give evidence at 12.9\uf073 C.L.

In particular, the DAMA model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics scenarios for high and low mass candidates inducing nuclear recoil and/or electromagnetic radiation, as also shown in various literature. Moreover, both the negative results and all the possible positive hints, achieved so-far in the field, can be compatible with the DAMA model independent DM annual modulation results in many scenarios considering also the existing experimental and theoretical uncertainties; the same holds for indirect approaches. For a discussion see e.g. Ref. [5] and references therein. Updated/new corollary analyses on various possible DM scenarios will be addressed in the next dedicated works. Finally, we stress that to efficiently disentangle among at least some of the many possible candidates and scenarios an increase of exposure in the new lowest energy bin is important. The experiment is collecting data and related R&D is under way.",
