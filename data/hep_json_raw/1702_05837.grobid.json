Zou 1   Using an electron-positron collision data sample of 2.93 fb \u22121 collected at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we present the first search for the radiative leptonic decay D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bde. The analysis is performed with a double tag method. We do not observe a significant D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bde signal, and obtain an upper limit on the branching fraction of D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bde decay with the energy of radiative photon larger than 10 MeV of 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% confidence level.",

            "text": "The radiative leptonic decays of heavy mesons have been studied with various models [1][2][3][4]. Within the perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) approach, the branching fraction of D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e decay is predicted to be of order 10 \u22124 [1]. Much smaller branching fractions, of order 10 \u22126 , are obtained within the light front quark model [2] and the non-relativistic constituent quark model [3]. In Ref. [4], the long-distance contribution is considered via the vector meson dominance (VMD) model and it is found that the decay rate may be enhanced significantly. To deal with non-perturbative effects, it is important to separate the hard and soft physics, typically with an approach known as factorization. Many approaches to factorization of the radiative leptonic decays of heavy mesons have been proposed [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In recent papers [12,13], factorization is extended to consider the first-order corrections in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s and the heavy quark mass; the branching fraction of D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e decay is predicted to be of order 10 \u22125 .",

To improve the degraded momentum resolution of the electron due to FSR and bremsstrahlung, the energy of neighboring photons, presumably due to FSR, is added back to electron candidates.

Other systematic uncertainties, related to the detection efficiencies, are summarized in Table III. To evaluate the systematic uncertainty related to the model of the decay dynamics, an alternative signal MC sample based on the single pole model [1,12] is produced, and the resultant difference in the detection efficiency with respect to the nominal value, 3.5%, is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties of electron tracking and PID are estimated to be 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively, by studying a control sample of radiative Bhabha scattering events. The uncertainty in photon reconstruction is assigned as 1.0%, based on a study of double-tagged D 0 \u2192 K S \u03c0 0 events [28]. The uncertainty related with the lateral moment requirement for the photon is estimated to be 4.4% by studying a photon control sample from radiative Bhabha scattering events. The quadratic sum of the above systematic uncertainties, related to detection efficiency, is 5.8%.",

[28,29] which takes into account the effects of both systematic and statistical uncertainties. We obtain a smooth probability density function (PDF) from the data sample using the kernel estimation method [30]. A large number of toy MC samples are generated according to the smooth PDF, while the number of events in each MC sample is allowed to fluctuate with a Poisson distribution according to the yield found in the fit to the data sample. The same fit procedure used for data is applied to each toy MC sample, while randomly making systematic variations in the fit procedure, as described in the previous section. In the calculation of the branching fraction B(D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e ) for the toy MC sample, the DT efficiencies are varied randomly according to the detection efficiency uncertainties (5.8%), and the ST yields and the corresponding efficiencies are varied randomly according to the statistical uncertainty due to the size of data and MC samples. The resultant distribution of B(D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e ) for all toy MC samples is shown in Fig 3. By integrating up to 90% of the area in the physical region B(D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e ) \u2265 0, we obtain an upper limit at the 90% C.L. for the branching fraction as B(D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e ) < 3.0 \u00d7 10 ",

No significant D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e signal is observed. With a 10 MeV cutoff on the radiative photon energy, the upper limit of the decay branching fraction for D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e is B(D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd e ) < 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% C.L.
