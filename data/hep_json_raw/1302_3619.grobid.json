An important collider dark matter signature is due to the production of a pair of these invisible particles with the initial-state radiation of a standard model particle. Currently, collider searches use individual and nearly orthogonal final states to search for initial-state jets, photons or massive gauge bosons. We combine these results across final states and across experiments to give the strongest current collider-based limits in the context of effective field theories, and map these to limits on dark matter interactions with nuclei and to dark matter self-annhiliation.",

For example, the mono-jet analyses do not veto events with a photon, and the mono-photon analyses allow the presence of one jet. From our parton-level sim-157 ulated event samples, we estimated the overlaps among 158 different channels and found that the overlap fraction is 159 less than 1%. 160 The individual analyses include signal uncertainties of 161 up to 20% on the cross section, mostly due to uncertain-162 ties in jet energy calibration and levels of initial-state 163 radiation. These uncertainties do not affect the cross-164 section limits, but can be simply applied to limits on 165 M . In each case, we quote the limit using the central 166 value. 167 To summarize, the assumptions made in this combinathe signal selections are orthogonal the intermediate step of a model-independent limit on the number of events N is no longer possible, as the limits depend on the relative distribution of signal events across channels, which is model specific. Instead, crosssection limits are obtained directly. These limits are then converted into limits on M , using the relationships from Ref. [15]. The individual-channel limits, combination across experiments and the grand combination of all 181 channels are shown in Table V for the D5 operator and 182 one choice of m \u03c7 .
