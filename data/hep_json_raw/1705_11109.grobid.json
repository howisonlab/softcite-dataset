            "text": "The study of hadronic decays of charmed baryons provides important information to understand both the strong and the weak interactions [1]. It also provides essential input to understand background contributions in the study of b-baryon physics, as b decays dominantly to + c . More than 30 years have passed since the + c baryon was first observed in e + e \u2212 annihilations by the Mark II experiment [2] and the knowledge of + c decays remains very poor compared to that for charmed mesons. So far, measured decay modes account for only about 60% [3]   8 Also at Goethe University Frankfurt, 60323 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 9 Also at the NRC \"Kurchatov Institute\", PNPI, 188300, Gatchina, Russia. 10 Also at Bogazici University, 34342 Istanbul, Turkey. ments exist except for + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + [3]. Therefore, searching for additional decay modes with \u2212 in the final state is important to build up knowledge on + c decays. In this paper, we report the first observation of the so-far undetermined, but expected to be large, decay of + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 . 11 In addition, we perform the first absolute measurement of the branching fraction for clean and straightforward BF measurement that is independent of the number of + c\u00af \u2212 c events produced.",

After weighting \u03b5 i \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 ) by the mode-bymode ST yields in data, we find the overall average efficiencies \u03b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + = (61.8 \u00b1 0.4)% and \u03b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 = (29.0 \u00b1 0.2)%, where the branching fraction for \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 is included. Substituting the With the DT technique, the BF measurement is insensitive to uncertainty in the ST efficiencies. The systematic uncertainties in measuring B( + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) and B( + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ) mainly arise from the efficiencies of \u03c0 detection and identification, fits to the M n\u03c0 \u2212 \u2212 M n distributions and the signal modelling in the MC simulation. The systematic uncertainties in the \u03c0 \u00b1 tracking and identification are both determined to be 1.0% by studying a set of samples of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 obtained from data with c.m. energy above 4.0 GeV. The \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is validated by analyzing DT events with  with different choices for signal shapes (double Gaussian function), background shapes (first-order polynomial function, thirdorder polynomial function and a MC-derived background shape) and fit ranges ((0.19, 0.34) GeV/c 2 ). The uncertainty in modelling the signal process is obtained by varying the reweighting factors of the observed kinematic variables within their statistical uncertainties and extracting the difference of the resultant efficiencies. The difference is estimated to be 2.0% for the studied channels and is taken as the systematic uncertainty due to the signal modelling. In addition, there are systematic uncertainties in obtaining N tot \u2212 c evaluated by using alternative signal shapes in the fits to the M BC spectra [13], resulting in an uncertainty of 1.0%, and in the statistical limitation of the MC samples, which is estimated to be 0.6 (0.7)% for + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 ).

The analysis technique in this work, which was first applied in the Mark III experiment[6], is optimized for measuring charm hadron pairs produced near threshold. First, we select the subset of our events in which a \u00af \u2212 c is reconstructed in an exclusive hadronic decay mode, designated as the single-tag (ST) sample. Events in this ST sample are then searched for the signal channel + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 )in the system recoiling against the ST to select double tag (DT) events. In the final states of + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 ), the \u2212 hyperon is detected through \u2212 \u2192 n\u03c0 \u2212 . As the neutron is not reconstructed in this analysis, we deduce its kinematic properties by four-momentum conservation. The absolute branching fraction (BF) of + c \u2192 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 ) is derived from the probability of detecting the DT signals in the ST sample.
