            "text": "Following the discovery of a Higgs boson (H) at the CERN LHC [1][2][3], with mass around 125 GeV and properties so far consistent with the standard model (SM) of particle physics, it has become important to search for new resonances that decay into pairs of such Higgs bosons. While non-resonant pair production of the Higgs boson is allowed in the SM, the theoretical production cross section is approximately 10 fb [4] and well beyond the sensitivity of currently acquired data. However, several well-motivated hypotheses of physics beyond the standard model posit narrowwidth resonances that decay into pairs of Higgs bosons, and could be produced with large enough cross sections to be probed with existing data. The radion [5] and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons in the Randall-Sundrum (RS1) [6] model of warped extra dimensions are examples of such resonances [7].",

The search for the narrow width resonance, denoted by X , is performed in the 270-1100 GeV mass range. Data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and recorded by the CMS experiment corresponding to an E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. integrated luminosity of 17.9 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV is used. We perform this search for the case where both Higgs bosons decay into bottom quark-antiquark pairs (bb) [8]. The main challenge of this search is to distinguish the signal of four bottom quarks in the final state that hadronize into jets (b jets) from the copious multijet background described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in pp collisions. We address this challenge by suitable event selection criteria that include dedicated b-jet identification techniques and a model of the multijet background that is validated in data control regions. Our results may be compared with a search performed by the ATLAS experiment [9] that also probes the physics of resonant Higgs boson pair production, albeit in the channel where one Higgs boson decays to bottom quarks and the other decays to photons.",

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [11,12] with a distance parameter of 0.5 applied on the collection of particle candidates reconstructed by the particleflow (PF) algorithm [13,14]. The PF algorithm reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with a combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. To mitigate the effect of additional particles that do not originate from the hard interaction in jet reconstruction, we subtract charged hadrons that do not arise from the primary vertex associated with the jet from the collection of clustered particles. Further, an average neutral energy density from particles not arising from the primary vertex is evaluated and subtracted from the jets [15]. Energy corrections for the jets are determined as functions of the jet transverse momentum p T and pseudorapidity |\u03b7|. Jet identification criteria [16] to reject detector noise misidentified as jets, and jets not originating from the hard interaction are also applied.",

Thus, their decay products originate from secondary vertices made of tracks that have impact parameters with respect to the primary vertex of a similar scale. The pixel tracker provides an impact parameter resolution of about 15 \u03bcm for charged tracks with |\u03b7| < 2.4. To maximize the b-tagging performance of the detector, we combine the output discriminants of several b-tagging algorithms described in Ref. [17] with a trained artificial neural network. This we call the combined multivariate (CMVA) algorithm. In particular, we combine the outputs of the combined secondary vertex (CSV) tagger that uses secondary vertices identified by the inclusive vertex finder (IVF) algorithm [18], the jet probability (JP) tagger, and the two soft lepton taggers.",

The angular distributions of a spin-2 resonance are distinct from those of a spin-0 resonance, and result in different kinematic distributions. Therefore, we evaluate the signal efficiencies for a narrow-width spin-2 resonance from a separate simulation of the first excitation of the KK graviton produced through gluon fusion in the same extra dimension scenario as the radion. The resonance is forced to decay to a pair of Higgs bosons where both Higgs bosons decay to bb. Samples of these signal events, as well as background events from diboson, W + jets, Z + jets and top-quark pair production (tt) processes, are generated using the MadGraph 5.1 [19] program interfaced with pythia 6.4 [20] for parton showering and hadronization. QCD multijet event samples are simulated with the pythia 6.4 program. A sample of events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson is simulated using the powheg event generator [21][22][23] interfaced with the herwig++ [24] program for showering and hadronization.

For jets with p T > 40 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 this working point yields a 75% efficiency for tagging jets originating from b hadrons and a mistagging rate of 3% for light-flavor jets. For the LMR, we combine these b jets into pairs to create HH candidates such that |m H \u2212 125 GeV| < 35 GeV for each candidate Higgs boson. The mass resolution on the Higgs boson in the LMR is found to be approximately 9 GeV. Selected HH candidates are required to have at least two jets with p T > 90 GeV.
