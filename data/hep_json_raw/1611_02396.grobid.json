The data were recorded by the NA61/SHINE detector at the CERN SPS. Starting with rapidity distributions dn/dy the procedure of obtaining total multiplicities is presented. The mean number of wounded nucleons W extracted from the Glissando MC model is used to calculate the ratio \u03c0 \u2212 / W . The results are compared to those from other experiments and their dependence on colliding systems and collision energy is discussed.",

In order to compare results obtained for different systems, an isospin correction should be applied. To this end phenomenological formulas are used: \u03c0 \u2212 N+N = \u03c0 \u2212 p+p + 1/3 and in the case of Au+Au the average ( \u03c0 \u2212 Au+Au + \u03c0 + Au+Au )/2. This procedure is based on the compilation of the world data and the model presented in [14]. The correction for nucleusnucleus collisions was only applied at 13A GeV where it is large. As seen from Fig. 2 the \u03c0 \u2212 / W ratio shows little dependence on the system size at the lower energies while a rising tendency is observed at the highest energy.",
