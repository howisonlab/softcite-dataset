The references of the generators, used for this study, are found in [7]. The background processes considered for this study are listed in Table 1. For the SM Higgs boson in ggF production, the QCD soft-gluon resummations, calculated in the nextto-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) approximation, are applied. The Z+jets production, modelled with up to five partons, is divided in two sources: Z+light-jets and Zbb. For data and simulation comparison, the QCD cross-section calculations (see Table 1) are used to normalize the simulation for inclusive Z boson and Zbb production. The ZJ/\u03c8 and Z\u03a5 Monte Carlo (MC) samples are normalized using the ATLAS measurement described in [10]. The SM Higgs productions, SM ZZ * and diboson processes are normalized with the theoretical cross-sections and decay branching ratios as well as their uncertainties. For taking into account the different conditions in the pileup, as a function of the instantaneous luminosity, the simulated minimunbias overlayed events, generated with PYTHIA8 onto the hard-scattering process, were used. Such events were reweighted according to the distribution of the mean number of interactions observed in data. All the MC background samples generated are reconstructed using the \"full detector simulation\" ATLAS software [11] which is based on GEANT4 [12]. The signal samples are reconstructed with the \"fast detector simulation\" ATLAS software [13] which only parametrized the response of the electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the ATLAS calorimeter, and the rest of the systems are reconstructed as \"full detector simulation\".",

The muon candidates selected are formed by matching reconstructed ID tracks with either a complete track or track-segment reconstructed in MS  [14]. The acceptance is extended using tracks reconstructed in the forward region of the MS (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.7), which is outside the ID coverage. If both an ID or a complete MS track are present, the two independent momentum measurements are combined; otherwise the information of the ID or the MS is used alone. In the case of the electrons candidates, they must have well-reconstructed ID track pointing to an electromagnetic calorimeter cluster and the cluster should satisfy a set of identification criteria [15]. Tracks associated with electromagnetic clusters are fitted using a Gaussian-Sum Filter [15], which allows for bremsstrahlung energy losses to be taken into account. Each electron (muon) must satisfy p T > 7 GeV (p T > 6 GeV) and be measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.47 (|\u03b7| < 2.7). The longitudinal impact parameters of the leptons along the beam axis z 0 are required to be within 10 mm of the reconstructed primary vertex (muons without ID track are exempted of this requirement). To reject the cosmic rays, muon tracks are required to have a transverse impact parameter d 0 (closest approach to the primary vertex in the x-y plane) of less than 1mm. For avoiding double-counting of leptons, an overlap removal is applied. If two electrons share the same ID track or within in a cone (\u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 < 0.1), the one with the highest transverse energy deposit in the calorimeter (E T ) is kept. An electron within in a muon cone (\u2206R = 0.2) is removed, and a calorimeter-based reconstructed muon within an electron cone (\u2206R = 0.2) is removed. After selecting the leptons with proper quality, events with at least four leptons, with all possible combinations of four leptons containing two same-flavor and opposite-sign (SFOS) defined the \"quadruplets\", are kept. Each lepton is ordered by p T , the three highest-p T leptons should have: p T l1 > 20 GeV, p T l2 > 15 GeV and p T l3 > 10 GeV. It is also required that at least one (two) of the lepton(s), from the quadruplet, must satisfy the single-lepton (dilepton) trigger requirements. Each dilepton invariant mass or each SFOS pair, from the quadruplet, are denoted by m 12 (formed by leptons 1 and 2) and m 34 (formed by leptons 3 and 4). For the H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l study, both Z d boson are considered to be on-shell, because of that, there is not any distinction between the SFOS pairs. If in the event there are several \"quadruplets\", only the quadruplet that satisfies the minimum value of \u2206m \u2261 |m 12 \u2212 m 34 | is selected. Subsequently, the transverse impact parameter significance (IP) and the isolation requirements are imposed to the leptons of the quadruplet selected, and four final requirements that defined the two signal regions (SR) considered in this study are shown in Table 3. In Figs. 1 and 2 show the dilepton and four-lepton invariant masses after the IP requirements, respectively, in the dilepton mass the m 12 and m 34 are combined.",
