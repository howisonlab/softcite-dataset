            "text": "The discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, H(125), at the CERN LHC in 2012 [1][2][3] was a major breakthrough in particle physics. A combined study of data from collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations shows the particle to have properties consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson [4][5][6][7][8][9] including the spin, couplings, and charge-parity assignment [10,11]. Lepton flavour violating (LFV) decays of the H(125) are forbidden in the SM. However, the presence of new physics in the Higgs sector is not excluded [12] and there exist many possible extensions of the SM that allow LFV decays of the H(125). These include the two Higgs doublet model [13], supersymmetric models [14][15][16][17][18][19][20], composite Higgs models [21,22], models with flavour symmetries [23], Randall-Sundrum models [24][25][26], and others [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]. A common feature of many of these models is the presence of additional neutral Higgs bosons (H and A) that would also have LFV decays [36,37].",

These constraints were a significant improvement over the previously set limits by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations using the 8 TeV pp collision data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb \u22121 [39][40][41][42]. Results from the previous CMS H(125) \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 search, performed using 8 TeV pp collision data, were used to set limits on high mass LFV H decays in a phenomenological study [12].

The search is performed in four decay channels, H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h , H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 e , H \u2192 e\u03c4 h , and H \u2192 e\u03c4 \u00b5 where \u03c4 h , \u03c4 e , and \u03c4 \u00b5 correspond to the hadronic, electronic and muonic decay channels of \u03c4 leptons, respectively. The final-state signatures are very similar to those of the H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decays, studied by CMS [43][44][45][46] and ATLAS [47]. However, there are some significant kinematic differences. The primary difference is that the muon (electron) in the LFV H \u2192 \u00b5(e)\u03c4 decay is produced promptly, and tends to have a higher momentum than in the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b5(e) \u03c4 decay. Only the gluon fusion production process is considered in this search and the signal is modelled assuming a narrow width of the Higgs boson. The strategy is similar to the previous LFV H(125) searches performed by the CMS Collaboration, but optimised for higher mass Higgs boson decays.",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [49]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of -2 -",

A trigger requiring at least one muon is used to collect the data sample in the H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h and H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 e channels. Triggers requiring at least one electron, or a combination of an electron and a muon are used for the H \u2192 e\u03c4 h and H \u2192 e\u03c4 \u00b5 channels respectively. Simulated samples of signal and background events are produced with different event generators. The H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 and H \u2192 e\u03c4 decay samples are generated with powheg 2.0 [51][52][53][54][55][56] at next-to-leading-order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Only the gluon fusion (ggH) [57] production mode has been considered in this analysis. These scalar boson samples are generated assuming the narrow width approximation for a range of masses from 200 to 900 GeV. The Z+jets and W+jets processes are simulated using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 [58] generator at leading order with the MLM jet matching and merging [59]. The MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator is also used for diboson production which is simulated at NLO with the FxFx jet matching and merging scheme [60]. The powheg 2.0 and 1.0 at NLO are used for top quark-antiquark (tt) and single top quark production, respectively. The powheg and MadGraph5 amc@nlo generators are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [61] for parton showering and fragmentation. The pythia parameters for the underlying event description are set to the CUETP8M1 tune [62]. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) used is NNPDF30nloas0118 [63]. The CMS detector response is modelled using Geant4 [64].",

Identification is based on the number of spatial points measured in the tracker and in the muon system, the track quality, and its consistency with the event vertex location. The identification working point chosen for this analysis reconstructs muons with an efficiency above 98% and a hadron misidentification rate of 0.1% for pions and 0.3% for kaons. The energy is obtained from the corresponding track momentum. An important aspect of muon reconstruction is the lepton isolation that is described later in this section.",

Finally, neutral hadrons are identified as HCAL energy clusters not linked to any charged hadron trajectory, or as a combined ECAL and HCAL energy excess with respect to the expected charged hadron energy deposit. All the PF candidates are clustered into hadronic jets using the infrared-and collinear-safe anti-k T algorithm [66], implemented in the FastJet package [70], with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions, increasing the apparent jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation studies so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jets, and multijet events are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and in simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [71]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures.",

The uncertainties that affect the shape of the M col distribution, mainly those corresponding to the energy scales, are represented by nuisance parameters whose variation results in a modification of the distribution [82,83]. A profile likelihood ratio is used as test statistic. The 95% CL upper limits on the H production cross section times branching fraction to LFV lepton channels, \u03c3(gg \u2192 H)B(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4) and \u03c3(gg \u2192 H)B(H \u2192 e\u03c4), are set using the CL s criterion [84,85] and the asymptotic approximation of the distributions of the LHC teststatistic [86], in a combined fit to the M col distributions. The limits are also computed per channel and category. The upper limits are derived in the analysed mass range in steps of 50 GeV.
