It has long been known 341 that a flat continuum distribution in this complex re-342 gion that includes many {bb} mass thresholds is overly simplistic [20], and we conclude that this internal inconsistency of the R \u2032 b fit, elucidated by P, is likely due to the model's na\u00efvet\u00e9. This finding leads to the conclusion that masses and widths for the \u03a5(10860) and \u03a5(11020) obtained from R (\u2032) b carry unknown systematic uncertainties due to the unknown shape of the continuum and its interaction with the resonance, which may vary with energy. The results reported here for the masses, widths, and relative phase of the \u03a5(10860) and \u03a5(11020) are thus from the \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 analysis, which are robust due to low continuum content. We have considered the following sources of systematic uncertainty: integrated luminosity, event selection efficiency, energy calibration, reconstruction efficiency, secondary branching fractions, and fitting procedure. The effects of the uncertainties in R (\u2032) b and R \u03a5(nS)\u03c0\u03c0 on \u03a5(5S) and \u03a5(6S) parameters depend on whether they are correlated or not over the data sets at different energy points. The overall uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 1.4%, while the uncorrelated variation is 0.1%-0.2%. The uncertainty in the bb event selection efficiency, \u01eb bb , stems from uncertainties in the mix of event types, containing B ( * ) , B ( * ) s , and bottomonia and is estimated to be 1.1% (uncorrelated). The uncertainty on R \u03a5(nS)\u03c0\u03c0 for each \u03a5(nS) is dominated by those on the branching fractions, B(\u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) [11]: \u00b12%, \u00b110%, and \u00b110% for n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The uncertainties from possible non-zero A c and/or A ic in R \u03a5(nS)\u03c0\u03c0 are obtained by allowing them to float in the fit and taking the variation of the fitted values of the other parameters with respect to default results. Possible biases due to constraints on k n and \u03b4 n in the fit are estimated by taking the shifts found by varying the constraints and included as systematic errors. The lower end of the fit range is varied between 10.63 and 10.82 GeV. Approximate radiative corrections to the visible cross-section measurements are made, as in Ref. [19], and the fits are repeated.
