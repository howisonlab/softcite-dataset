The ratio of the prompt J/\u03c8 plus W \u00b1 cross-section to the inclusive W \u00b1 cross-section is presented as a differential measurement as a function of J/\u03c8 transverse momenta and compared with theoretical predictions using different double-parton-scattering cross-sections.",

            "text": "The associated production of prompt J/\u03c8 mesons with W \u00b1 bosons provides a powerful probe of the charmonium production mechanism in hadronic collisions, allowing tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the boundary between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes. The ATLAS Collaboration has previously presented two analyses of J/\u03c8 mesons produced in conjunction with vector bosons: the associated production of prompt J/\u03c8 + W \u00b1 in \u221a s = 7 TeV data [1] and the production of prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 + Z in \u221a s = 8 TeV data [2]. This paper presents a new measurement of the ratio of the cross-section for associated production of prompt J/\u03c8 + W \u00b1 to the inclusive W \u00b1 production cross-section with W \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 + at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, exploiting a four-fold increase in integrated luminosity over the previous measurement [1]. The analysis strategy closely follows the methods of the earlier papers. Prompt production refers to a J/\u03c8 meson that is produced directly in the proton-proton collision or indirectly -1 -JHEP01(2020)095 from a heavier charmonium state, while non-prompt production occurs when the J/\u03c8 meson is produced in the decay of a b-hadron. The J/\u03c8 events that are produced from radiative decays of heavier charmonium states (such as \u03c7 c \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8) are not distinguished from directly produced J/\u03c8 mesons, as long as they are produced in the initial hard interaction.",

            "text": "Despite being studied for many decades [3][4][5][6][7][8][9], the production mechanism of J/\u03c8 mesons in hadronic collisions is not fully understood. The main models for perturbative calculations of heavy quarkonium production (QQ) in hadronic collisions differ in whether the system is produced in a colour singlet (CS) state or a colour octet (CO) state [10][11][12][13][14]. The CS model requires two hard gluons in a colour singlet in the initial state, or one gluon splitting into QQ where one of the quarks radiates a hard gluon. The non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework allows the QQ system to remain in a colour-octet state and then generates the final colour-neutral meson via low-energy non-perturbative matrix elements; these matrix elements are determined from fits to experimental data [11,12,[14][15][16].",

The fiducial measurement for J/\u03c8 + W \u00b1 is defined in a restricted kinematic range for the muons from J/\u03c8 decay, and is specific to the ATLAS detector, while the inclusive result is determined by correcting for the detector's kinematic acceptance to muons.

The cross-section ratios are presented for J/\u03c8 transverse momenta in the range 8.5 < p J/\u03c8 T < 150 GeV and rapidities satisfying |y J/\u03c8 | < 2.1. The results are presented initially for muons from J/\u03c8 decay in the fiducial volume of the ATLAS detector and then corrected for the kinematic acceptance of the muons in the fiducial region. This correction factor depends on the spin-alignment state of the J/\u03c8 produced in association with a W \u00b1 boson, which may differ from the spin alignment observed in inclusive J/\u03c8 production. Measurements of the azimuthal angle between the W \u00b1 boson and J/\u03c8 meson suggest that single-and double-parton-scattering contributions are both present in data. The measured prompt J/\u03c8 + W \u00b1 production rates are compared with a theoretical prediction at NLO for colour-octet prompt production processes. Due to the uncertainty in the value of the effective double-parton-scattering cross-section \u03c3 eff , two different values are used for comparisons of theoretical predictions with data. A smaller value of \u03c3 eff brings the predicted cross-section ratio closer to the measured value; however, neither value of \u03c3 eff is able to correctly model the J/\u03c8 p T dependence, possibly because colour-singlet processes are not included in the prediction.",
