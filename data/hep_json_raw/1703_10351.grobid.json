A combined fit is performed to the cross sections of these four final states to measure the resonant parameters of the Y (4220). We determine a mass M = (4219.6 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 5.1) MeV/c 2 and a total width \u0393 = (56.0 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b1 6.9) MeV for the Y (4220), where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones systematic. We determine the lower limit of its leptonic decay width of around 30 eV, which can be compared with the theoretical expectations of different models. We also estimate its partial decay width to \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 in different scenarios. These information is essential for the understanding of the nature of this state.",

The Y -states show strong coupling to hidden-charm final states in contrast to the vector charmonium states in the same energy region (\u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), \u03c8(4415)) which couples dominantly to open-charm meson pairs.

In addition, more data points are added even at low energy, although with low integrated luminosity, to further constrain the line shape in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [16] process. While the structure in \u03c9\u03c7 c0 mode was affected only slightly with the new measurements at high energies [17], in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c mode, the Y (4220) was observed with improved significance together with a new structure, the Y (4390). The resonant parameters are M = (4218.4\u00b14.0\u00b10.9) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (66.0\u00b19.0\u00b10.4) MeV for the Y (4220), and M = (4391.6 \u00b1 6.3 \u00b1 1.0) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (139.5 \u00b1 16.1 \u00b1 0.6) MeV for the Y (4390) [16]. The updated cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c are shown in Fig. 1, where the measurements at energy points both with integrated luminosities larger than 40 pb \u22121 (referred to as 'XY Z data sample' hereafter) and with integrated luminosities smaller than 20 pb \u22121 (referred to as 'R-scan data sample' hereafter) are presented. The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 at c.m. energies up to 5.0 GeV was first studied by the BABAR experiment, where the Y (4260) was observed [4]. Belle measured the cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 at c.m. energies between 3.8 and 5.0 GeV and reported that Y (4260) alone cannot describe the line shape satisfactorily [18]. Improved measurements with both BABAR [19] and Belle [5] full data samples confirmed the existence of non-Y (4260) component in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 but the line shape was parametrized with different models. Recently, BESIII reported a precise measurement of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross sections at c.m. energies from 3.77 to 4.60 GeV (as shown in Fig. 1) using data samples with an integrated luminosity of 9 fb \u22121 [20]. While the nature of the events at around 4 GeV is still ambiguous, the dominant resonant structure, the so called Y (4260), was found to have a mass of (4222.0\u00b13.1\u00b11.4) MeV/c 2 and a width of (44.1\u00b14.3\u00b12.0) MeV, in good agreement with the Y (4220) observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [16]. In addition, a new resonance with a mass of around 4.32 GeV/c 2 is needed to describe the high precision data.",

As such a state is not observed in other open charm final states [23], these four final states are probably the dominant decay modes of the Y (4220). By applying constraints to the resonant parameters in a simultaneous fit to the cross sections of these four processes, we may obtain the best knowledge on the Y (4220), including resonant parameters (mass, width, coupling to lepton pair, and decay branching fractions), and thus a better understanding of its nature [1], especially whether it is an exotic state, such as a tetraquark state in the diquark-antidiquark model [24], a vector molecular state of DD 1 (2420) [25], a mixture of two hadrocharmonium states [26], an \u03c9\u03c7 cJ molecule [27,28], or a charmonium-hybrid state [29].",

For the most interesting mode, Y(4220)\u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8, we obtain B \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 = (12.9 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 3.9)% (or a partial width of (7.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 2.2) MeV) for the case of smallest B \u00d7 \u0393 e + e \u2212 ; and B \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 = (11.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 1.9)% (or a partial width of (6.3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 1.1) MeV) for the case of highest B \u00d7 \u0393 e + e \u2212 . In these two particular cases, the branching faction of the Y(4220)\u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 is very big. We may also calculate the B \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 in the most extreme case, i.e., taking the smallest B\u00d7\u0393 e + e \u2212 for \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 and largest B\u00d7\u0393 e + e \u2212 for other modes, we find B \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 = (2.1\u00b10.3\u00b10.7)% (or a partial width of (1.2\u00b10.2\u00b10.4) MeV).",
