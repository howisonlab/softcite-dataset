Such di erences are associated with the non-invariance of fundamental interactions under the combined chargeconjugation and parity transformations, known as CP violation. Here, using data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, we search for CP-violating asymmetries in the decay angle distributions of \u039b 0 b baryons decaying to p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and p\u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 final states. These four-body hadronic decays are a promising place to search for sources of CP violation both within and beyond the standard model of particle physics. We find evidence for CP violation in \u039b 0 b to p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays with a statistical significance corresponding to 3.3 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties. This represents the first evidence for CP violation in the baryon sector.",

            "text": "he asymmetry between matter and antimatter is related to the violation of the CP symmetry (CPV), where C and P are the charge-conjugation and parity operators. CP violation is accommodated in the standard model (SM) of particle physics by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism that describes the transitions between up-and down-type quarks 1,2 , in which quark decays proceed by the emission of a virtual W boson and where the phases of the couplings change sign between quarks and antiquarks. However, the amount of CPV predicted by the CKM mechanism is not sufficient to explain our matter-dominated Universe 3,4 and other sources of CPV are expected to exist. The initial discovery of CPV was in neutral K meson decays 5 , and more recently it has been observed in B 0 (refs 6,7), B + (refs [8][9][10][11], and B 0 s (ref. 12) meson decays, but it has never been observed in the decays of any baryon. Decays of the \u039b 0 b (bud) baryon to final states consisting of hadrons with no charm quarks are predicted to have non-negligible CP asymmetries in the SM, as large as 20% for certain three-body decay modes 13 . It is important to measure the size and nature of these CP asymmetries in as many decay modes as possible, to determine whether they are consistent with the CKM mechanism or, if not, what extensions to the SM would be required to explain them 14- 16 .",

Throughout this paper the inclusion of charge-conjugate reactions is implied, unless otherwise indicated. CPV could arise from the interference of two amplitudes with relative phases that differ between particle and antiparticle decays, leading to differences in the \u039b 0 b and \u039b 0 b decay rates. The main source of this effect in the SM would be the large relative phase (referred to as \u03b1 in the literature) between the product of the CKM matrix elements V ub V * ud and V tb V * td , which are present in the different diagrams depicted in Fig. 1. Parity violation (PV) is also expected in weak interactions, but has never been observed in \u039b 0 b decays. To search for CP-violating effects one needs to measure CPodd observables, which can be done by studying asymmetries in the T operator. This is a unitary operator that reverses both the momentum and spin three-vectors 17,18 , and is different from the antiunitary time-reversal operator T 19,20 that also exchanges initial and final states. A non-zero CP-odd observable implies CP violation, and similar considerations apply to P-odd observables and parity violation 21 . Furthermore, different values of P-odd observables for a decay and its charge conjugate would imply CPV. In this paper, scalar triple products of final-state particle momenta in the \u039b 0 b centre-of-mass frame are studied to search for P-and CPviolating effects in four-body decays.

To avoid introducing biases in the results, all aspects of the analysis, including the selection, phase space regions, and procedure used to determine the statistical significance of the results, were fixed before the data were examined. The LHCb detector 29,30 is designed to collect data of b-hadron decays produced from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. It instruments a region around the proton beam axis, covering the polar angles between 10 and 250 mrad, where approximately 24% of the b-hadron decays occur 31 . The detector includes a high-precision tracking system with a dipole magnet, providing measurements of the momentum and decay vertex position of particle decays. Different types of charged particles are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, a calorimeter and a muon system. Simulated samples of \u039b 0 b signal modes and control samples are used in this analysis to verify the experimental method and to study certain systematic effects. These simulated events model the experimental conditions in detail, including the proton-proton collision, the decays of the particles, and the response of the detector. The software used is described in refs 32-38. The online event selection is performed by a trigger system that takes fast decisions about which events to record. It consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The software trigger requires \u039b 0 b candidates to be consistent with a b-hadron decay topology, with tracks originating from a secondary vertex detached from the primary pp collision point A boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier 40 is constructed from a set of kinematic variables that discriminate between signal and background. The signal and background training samples used for the BDT are derived from the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 control sample, since its kinematics and topology are similar to the decays under study; background in this sample is subtracted with the sPlot technique 41 , a statistical technique to disentangle signal and background contributions. The background training sample consists of candidates that lie far from the signal mass peak, between 5.85 and 6.40 GeV/c 2 ",

The values of a T -odd CP and a T -odd P are then calculated from A T and A T . In four-body particle decays, the CP asymmetries may vary over the phase space due to resonant contributions or their interference effects, possibly cancelling when integrated over the whole phase space.

The p-values of the CPsymmetry hypothesis are 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for schemes A and B, respectively, corresponding to statistical significances of 2.0 and 3.4 Gaussian standard deviations (\u03c3 ).

Applying this method to the \u03c7 2 values from schemes A and B individually, the p-values obtained agree with those from the \u03c7 2 test within the uncertainty due to the limited number of pseudoexperiments. To assess a combined significance from the two schemes, the product of the two p-values measured in data is compared with the distribution of the product of the p-values of the two binning schemes from the pseudoexperiments. The fraction of pseudoexperiments whose pvalue product is smaller than that seen in data determines the overall p-value of the combination of the two schemes 45 .

This is the first observation of these decay modes. Measurements of asymmetries in the entire phase space do not show any evidence of P or CP violation. Searches for localized P or CP violation are performed by measuring asymmetries in different regions of the phase space. The results are consistent with CP symmetry for \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 decays, but evidence for CP violation at the 3.3\u03c3 level is found in \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. No significant P violation is found. This represents the first evidence of CP violation in the baryon sector, and indicates an asymmetry between baryonic matter and antimatter.",
