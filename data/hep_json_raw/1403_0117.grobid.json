            "text": "Azimuthal particle correlations have been extensively studied in the past at various collider energies in p-p, p-A, and A-A collisions. Hadron-correlation measurements in heavy-ion collisions have mainly focused on studies of collective (flow) effects at low-p T and parton energy loss via jet quenching in the high-p T regime. This was usually done without event-by-event particle identification. In this paper, we present two-particle correlations with identified trigger hadrons and identified associated hadrons at mid-rapidity in Monte Carlo generated events. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of quantum number conservation and the flavour balance during parton fragmentation and hadronization. The simulated p-p events were generated with PYTHIA 6.4 with the Perugia-0 tune at \u221a s = 7 TeV. HIJING was used to generate 0 \u2212 10% central Pb-Pb events at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. We found that the extracted identified associated hadron spectra for charged pion, kaon, and proton show identified trigger-hadron dependent splitting. Moreover, the identified trigger-hadron dependent correlation functions vary in different p T bins, which may show the presence of collective/nuclear effects.",

            "text": "Charged hadron-hadron correlations have been extensively studied since the ISR and SppS experiments in the mid '70's [1]. These measurements have provided a good basis for investigating fragmentation processes. Well before jet reconstruction methods were born, these correlation measurements have been applied more recently in relativistic heavy-ion collisions where full jet reconstruction is challenging, especially at low jet energies. The focus of these studies was to investigate medium effects such as back-to-back jet suppression and modifications of the fragmentation process. Additionally, the discovery of long-range correlation structures in p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC was based on two-particle correlation measurements [2,3,4]. Various hadronization and hydrodynamical models of the space-time evolution of the hot and dense color medium, which have been employed to describe these phenomena, rely heavily on assumed parton and hadron distributions. Nevertheless, the measured hadron spectra and extracted fragmentation functions are integrated distributions which mix up all possible contributions of parton-hadron channels via the convolution of initial-state, QCD and final state effects of high energy collisions [5]. The only way to decouple the specific hadronization contributions is to test the conservation of quantum numbers by tracing the baryon number and flavor-specific emission patterns of hadrons from the partonic medium.",

Here, the baryon-to-meson ratio (for light and strange particles) is enhanced by more than a factor of three in Pb-Pb collisions compared to p-p collisions [6]. Since this unique kinematic range separates the low momentum thermal bulk production from the parton fragmentation dominated regime at high momenta, the expected production mechanism is of particular interest. On the other hand, the question of quantum number conservation during the phase transition from the partonic to the hadronic world can be addressed only through correlations beyond the simple baryon-to-meson ratios.",

Trigger particles with |\u03b7 trig | > 0.5 and the associated particles with |\u03b7 assoc | > 1 were rejected. In order to exclude the low-momentum region from the bulk effects, the transverse momenta of the trigger particles were considered above p T,trig > 2 GeV/c in all the cases.

A visible splitting effect is observed for all the trigger species starting from the first p T,assoc bin up to 10 \u2212 12 GeV/c. The largest splitting is observed in the unlike-sign correlation, p/p, where there is approximately 10-times more antiprotons than protons above a specific p T,assoc bin, that is the splitting strength is about an order of magnitude larger than the like-sign correlation p/p. The splitting, in case of unlike-sign pairs, for K + /K \u2212 is weaker than in the p/p but still comparable with it but the \u03c0 + /\u03c0 \u2212 shows very weak splitting. In contrast, the away-side p-p ratios, in Fig. 2 b, show an equal ratio for the pions and protons (compared to the near-side in Fig. 2 a). Conversely, kaons show a weak splitting in a limited transverse momentum range with respect to the near-side. The baryon number and charge is conserved and leads to highly correlated distributions in the same cone, since the fragmentation process was not modified by the media. These qualitative observations show that the strength of the quantum number conservation effects is increasing in the order of charge (C), strangeness (S ) and baryon number (B) respectively. In case of hadron correlations with multiple quantum number conservation (C, B, S , . . . etc.) this effect will be stronger.  baryon/meson anomaly was observed at RHIC and at the LHC [11], followed by the reversal of the splitting trend at higher transverse momenta. The charged pions show the splitting pattern only on the near-side. The lack of the splitting effect below 2 GeV/c may be attributed to the fact that in HIJING the embedded mini-jet production starts to appear around this scale. On the away-side (Fig. 2 d), it can be seen that the effect is opposite to the PYTHIA (Fig. 2 b), there are more like-sign particles coming from that region. Although it is much smaller than in the near-side, but not negligible. Moreover, we believe that the observed splitting of the protons and anti-protons presumably related to the embedded parametrization of baryon number and charge in HIJING. Further studies are ongoing to characterize better the observed splitting effects that provide an interesting contrast point between various MC event generators and experimental results from the LHC.",

In this section we investigate the p T,trig dependence of the spectra. We plot the differences between the like-sign and unlike-sign particle pairs for the normalized yields (dN PID assoc /dp T,assoc )/(dN hadron assoc /dp T,assoc ) as plotted in Fig. 2. Since positively charged triggers were choosen we came to the definition below in order to plot these ratios higher than one:   (3) where (+/\u2212) and (+/+) denote the unlike-sign and like-sign trigger/associated particle pairs, respectively. This ratio gives a more detailed insight into the evolution of the particle yield differences between the positive and negative associated particles as a function of p T,assoc . The ratios defined by Eq. 3are plotted for four different p T,trig trigger bins on the horizontal axis of Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 a it can be observed how the splits -in agreement with Fig. 2 -evolve as a function of p T,assoc in the near-side cone in PYTHIA events. In general, the splitting effect is the largest and growing for the case when we look at the differences between the p andp. Concerning strange particles it seems to saturate at higher p T,assoc . For pions the relative difference is about factor of 2 \u2212 3 at most. There is almost no change in the ordering of the species in the other p T,trig bins, 3 \u2212 7 GeV/c, 7 \u2212 10 GeV/c, and 10 \u2212 20 GeV/c, and the shapes remain at the same level.",

If we compare the columns, that is the different trigger/associated particle pairs, we can observe that on the near-side, the ratio of the number of the associated particles to the trigger particles is less for strange particles with respect to the baryons compared to the pions.

As for the first verification of the generated samples the identified hadrons were extracted from the raw associated particle spectra: \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 , K + , K \u2212 , p andp with fixed positively charged pion (\u03c0 + ) trigger in two separated \u2206\u03c6 regions, near-and away-side. Further investigation was needed to look deeper into the validity of the quantum number conservations of correlated particle pairs. For this reason we plotted the identified associated spectra for like-sign and unlike-sign trigger/associated particle pairs compared to the charged hadron identified associated spectra. We obtained conclusive results for PYTHIA: the PID-triggered-to-hadron-triggered associated spectra on the near-side show a signifi-cant splitting between the particles and anti-particles which have the largest effect for the baryon triggers, but is absent on the away-side. Qualitatively the difference between the baryon triggers and the pions is about one order of magnitude. For the HIJING simulation the results show an opposite trend to the PYTHIA up to p T,assoc = 7 \u2212 10 GeV/c and these effects are not vanishing on the away-side except for the pions. The splitting in Pb-Pb collisions starts at slightly larger p T,assoc threshold than in p-p because of the embedded physics in HIJING (for example the minijet production), but further investigation is needed with real data to confirm this observation. To conclude: collective/nuclear effects are visible in the studied 3 \u2212 10 GeV/c momentum range. There is no significant change between the yields of the unlike-sign particle pairs as we change the trigger p T,trig bins. Finally, we showed the PID-triggered azimuthal \u2206\u03c6 correlation spectra for the different trigger species. We have seen more associated protons than kaons on the near-side of the p-p collisions which does not depend on the applied trigger momentum p T,trig cuts. In Pb-Pb collisions the probability to generate protons or kaons as associated particles on the near-side is about equal.",
