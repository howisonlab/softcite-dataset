They also provide a clean environment to probe low energy QCD and measure fundamental properties of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Hadronic \u03c4 decays also play a critical role as a probe to search for new physics at the LHC. With the recent data collected at the B-Factory detectors, significant improvements in our knowledge of the hadronic decay structure can be made, allowing for improved modeling of \u03c4 decays at the LHC and at the next generation B-Factories.",

            "text": "Figure 4: The reconstructed and unfolded invariant mass spectra for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K \u2212 K + \u03bd \u03c4 channels. The reconstructed invariant mass distributions for (a) M(K \u2212 K \u2212 K + ), (b) M(K \u2212 K + ) and (c) M(K \u2212 K \u2212 ) are presented in the first row. In the second row, the (d) M(K \u2212 K \u2212 K + ), (e) M(K \u2212 K + ) and (f) M(K \u2212 K \u2212 ) unfolded invariant mass spectra are shown. For the reconstructed mass plots, the data is represented by the points with the error bars representing the statistical uncertainty. The blue (dark) histogram represents the non-\u03c4 background MC, the green (medium dark) histogram represents the \u03c4 backgrounds excluding the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 h \u2212 h + \u03bd \u03c4 cross-feed which are represented by the yellow (light) histogram. For the unfolded mass plots, the data is represented by the points with the inner error bars (green) representing the statistical uncertainty and the outer error bars (yellow) representing the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The integral of the unfolded distribution has been normalized to 1. The black dashed line is the generator level MC distribution used in the BABAR simulation which assumes that \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K \u2212 K + \u03bd \u03c4 decays entirely through \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6K \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 .",
