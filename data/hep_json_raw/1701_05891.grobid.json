The measurement probes the muon-tau symmetry hypothesis that requires maximal \u03b8 23 mixing (\u03b8 23 \u00bc \u03c0=4). Assuming the normal mass hierarchy, we find \u0394m 2 32 \u00bc \u00f02.67 AE 0.11\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 at the two statistically degenerate values 0.404 \u00fe0.030 \u22120.022 and 0.624 \u00fe0.022 \u22120.030 , both at the 68% confidence level. Our data disfavor the maximal mixing scenario with 2.6\u03c3 significance.",

            "text": "Neutrino flavor states (\u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , and \u03bd \u03c4 ) are superpositions of neutrino mass eigenstates (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3 ), giving rise to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations. The superpositions are described by the unitary matrix, U PMNS [1], that can be parameterized in terms of three mixing angles (\u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , and \u03b8 23 ) and a CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP . For a given distance traveled, the energy at which the largest oscillation probability occurs is governed by the differences in the squared masses of the neutrinos, \u0394m 2 21 and \u0394m 2 32 . The mixing angles and mass-squared differences have been measured by multiple experiments [2][3][4][5][6]. However, considerable uncertainty remains on the value of \u03b4 CP , the sign of \u0394m 2 32 , and whether \u03b8 23 is maximal, in the upper octant, or in the lower octant (\u03b8 23 \u00bc \u03c0=4, \u03b8 23 > \u03c0=4, or \u03b8 23 < \u03c0=4, respectively). Should \u03b8 23 \u00bc \u03c0=4, the \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd \u03c4 components of the \u03bd 3 mass eigenstate would be equal. Previous experimental results are compatible with \u03b8 23 \u00bc \u03c0=4 [3][4][5][6], motivating theoretical models with an underlying muon-tau symmetry in the neutrino sector [7]. More precise measurements are valuable in identifying viable theories of neutrino masses and mixing. In this Letter, we present updated measurements of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 by analyzing \u03bd \u03bc disappearance in NOvA data collected between February 6, 2014 and May 2, 2016. This corresponds to an accumulated 14-kton detector equivalent exposure of 6.05 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target, which is 2.2 times that used in our previous publication [6].",

The energy spectrum of the neutrinos produced by the NuMI beam [11] at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is measured by the Near Detector (ND) located 1 km away from the NuMI target. The neutrinos are subsequently detected 810 km away in the Far Detector (FD) near Ash River, MN. The 14-kton FD is located on the surface while the 290-ton ND is 100 m underground. Both detectors are sited off the central beam axis. The FD is 14.6 mrad off-axis so that the resulting narrow neutrino-energy spectrum peaks around 2 GeV, near the first oscillation maximum. The ND is positioned to maximize the similarity between the neutrino energy spectra observed at the two detectors. The flavor composition of beam neutrinos interacting in the ND (FD) is estimated from simulation to be 97.5% (97.8%) \u03bd \u03bc , 1.8% (1.6%)\u03bd \u03bc , and 0.7% (0.6%) \u03bd e \u00fe\u03bd e between 1-3 GeV, assuming no oscillations.",

Analysis of the hadronic energy distribution in the NOvA ND data further support this conclusion. While this is an area of active theoretical development [22], for the results presented here, our simulation has been augmented with a semi-empirical model in GENIE that posits neutrinos scatter from nucleon pairs (np and nn) within the nucleus [23]. The model is inspired by observations of rate enhancements in electronnucleus scattering data and their treatment via 2-particle 2-hole (2p2h) calculations that include meson exchange currents (MECs) [24]. Adjustments were made to the semiempirical model to achieve a more constant cross section for 2p2h-MEC processes above 1 GeV. These events are also reweighted as a function of three-momentum transfer and visible hadronic energy to match the ND data. The addition of 2p2h-MEC processes increases the simulated event rate by about 10% in both detectors, but the mean reconstructed neutrino energy and spectral shape remains largely unchanged. Additionally, as suggested by a reanalysis of bubble chamber data [25], the rate of \u03bd \u03bc -CC nonresonant single pion production in GENIE is reduced by 50% [26].",

Trajectories of charged particles are reconstructed using a technique based on the Kalman filter algorithm [28]. The resulting tracks are analyzed to identify muon candidates [29] by using four variables as inputs to a k-nearest neighbor (kNN classifier [30]: dE=dx likelihood, total track length, scattering likelihood, and fraction of planes along the track consistent with having additional hadronic activity. The kNN classifier is applied to all tracks in an event and the track with the highest output is used to select \u03bd \u03bc -CC candidate events. The impact of secondary particles carrying energy out of the detector is minimized by removing candidate events with hits in the outer two cells or planes, as well as events that have a short projected distance from the track ends to a detector edge. These containment requirements also significantly aid rejection of backgrounds originating outside the detector volume. The NC background is estimated from simulation to be 1.5% of the ND sample, while the background coming from both \u03bd e -CC and \u03bd \u03c4 -CC is well below 1%.",

As a first step, we select events within a 12 \u03bcs window centered on the beam spill. Additional cosmic ray rejection is achieved using a boosted decision tree [31] that includes information on the reconstructed event topology, such as track angle with respect to the beam, fraction of hits in the track, and scattering information. A high-statistics cosmic ray data set, recorded at times when there was no beam, was used in conjunction with simulated neutrino interactions to tune the cosmic rejection criteria. Using a separate data set collected alongside the beam spills in the long 550-\u03bcs readout window, we measure the rate of cosmic-induced background events passing our selection criteria. Overall, we reduce the cosmic-induced events occurring during the beam spills by 7 orders of magnitude, resulting in a cosmic background that is lower than the number of selected beam background events. The uncertainty on the remaining cosmic background is 9%, due to the limited size of that sample. The efficiency in the FD simulation for selecting contained \u03bd \u03bc -CC interactions is 62%.",

The estimated muon and hadronic energy resolution from our simulation are 3.5% and 25%, respectively, giving an overall energy resolution for selected \u03bd \u03bc -CC events of about 7% for both detectors. Studies of ND data show that the energy resolution is well modeled and that any remaining differences between data and MC calculations are accounted for by the systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis. Figure 1 shows the reconstructed muon energy, hadronic energy, and neutrino energy for selected \u03bd \u03bc -CC interactions in the ND.

The ratio also incorporates the effect of three-flavor neutrino oscillations, including matter effects, for any particular choice of the oscillation parameters. The FD true energy prediction is transformed into a reconstructed energy prediction using the simulated FD migration matrix.

These uncertainties can have an interdetector (relative) contribution, due to differences between the ND and the FD, and an absolute contribution that affects both detectors in the same way. The relative and absolute hadronic energy scale uncertainties are both estimated as 5%, based on studies of the ND response to protons in data compared to simulation and a comparison of different hadronic interaction models in GEANT4. The absolute muon energy scale uncertainty is set at 2% based on uncertainties in the simulation of energy loss in the detector materials [33]. The relative muon energy scale uncertainty, also 2%, arises from uncertainties in the material composition of the ND and the FD. A relative normalization uncertainty of 5% is dominated by the impact on the reconstruction efficiency of activity originating outside the detector. Neutrino cross section and hadronization uncertainties are taken from Ref. [34] with the following exceptions. The rescaled \u03bd \u03bc -CC nonresonant single-pion component is assigned a 50% uncertainty. Additionally, the 2p2h-MEC model rate uncertainty is also taken as 50%, motivated by remaining discrepancies between ND data and MC calculations. The absolute neutrino flux uncertainty of approximately 20% near the peak of the spectrum is dominated by uncertainties on hadron production [35]. This uncertainty is strongly correlated between the two detectors and is mitigated by the extrapolation procedure. The uncertainty on the number of selected NC, \u03bd e -CC, and \u03bd \u03c4 -CC background events is conservatively estimated at 100%. The simulated light output as a function of dE=dx was tuned using proton and muon tracks in the ND. The difference between the tuned response and the standard parameterization [36] was taken as a systematic uncertainty. Evaluation of different noise models in the simulation shows negligible changes to the energy scale and normalization. The main components of the analysis, including muon identification and event containment criteria, as well as muon and hadronic energy reconstruction, are nearly the same in both detectors, thereby reducing the impact of systematic effects. Table I summarizes the sources of uncertainty and their impact on the sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 measurements. The size of the impact is estimated by using the 68% C.L. interval from a fit to simulated data with only statistical uncertainty compared to a fit with the systematic uncertainty also included.",

The best fit has a \u03c7 2 =d:o:f: \u00bc 41.6=17, which arises mainly from bins in the tail of the energy spectrum that contain little information about the three-flavor oscillations. Restricting the fit to energies below 2.5 GeV reduces the \u03c7 2 =d:o:f: to 3.2=7 and does not significantly change the fit results. Maximal mixing, where sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.5, is disfavored by the data at 2.6\u03c3. Fixing sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.5 gives a best fit of \u0394m 2 32 \u00bc 2.48 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 (NH) with a prediction of 77.7 events.",
