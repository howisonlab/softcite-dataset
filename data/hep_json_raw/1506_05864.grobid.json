Considering hadrons in opposite thrust hemispheres of hadronic events, we observe clear azimuthal asymmetries in the ratio of unlike-sign to like-sign, and unlike-sign to all charged h1h2 pairs, which increase with hadron energies. The K\u03c0 asymmetries are similar to those measured for the \u03c0\u03c0 pairs, whereas those measured for high-energy KK pairs are, in general, larger.",

Since we measure the same dilution for KK, K\u03c0, and \u03c0\u03c0 samples, the asymmetry is corrected by rescaling A KK , A K\u03c0 , and A \u03c0\u03c0 using the same correction factor, which ranges from 1.3 to 2.3 increasing with z, as shown in Fig. 3.

We compare the bias results from the nominal selection, with those obtained by requiring different cuts on E tot , and/or by changing the detector acceptance region for the hadrons. The largest variation of the bias is combined in quadrature with the MC statistical error and taken as systematic uncertainty. The effects due to the particle identification are evaluated using tighter and looser selection criteria. The largest deviations with respect to the nominal selection are taken as systematic uncertainties: the average relative uncertainties are around 10%, 7%, and 5% for the KK, K\u03c0, and \u03c0\u03c0 pairs. Fitting the azimuthal distributions using different bin sizes, we determine relative systematic uncertainties, which are not larger than 5%, 1.9%, and 1% for the three samples. The systematic uncertainty due to the E tot cut is obtained by comparing the measured asymmetries with those obtained with the looser selection E tot > 10 GeV. The average systematic contribution is around 10% for the three samples in both reference frames. We use different fitting functions with additional higher harmonic terms. No significant changes in the value of the cosine moments with respect to the standard fits are found. As a cross-check of the double ratio method we fit the difference of R i distributions, and we compare the two results. The difference between the two procedures is negligible for K\u03c0 and \u03c0\u03c0 pairs, while it reaches 1% and 3% for kaon pairs in RF12 and RF0, respectively. All the other systematic contributions are negligible [11]. The Collins asymmetries measured for the 16 twodimensional (z 1 , z 2 ) bins, for reconstructed KK, K\u03c0, and \u03c0\u03c0 hadron pairs, are shown in Fig. 4 for RF12 and RF0, and are summarized in Tables reported in the Supplemental Material [30]. The asymmetries are corrected for the background contributions and K/\u03c0 contamination following Eq. 7, the MC bias is subtracted, and the corrections due to the dilution effects are applied. The total systematic uncertainties are obtained by adding in quadrature the individual contributions, and are represented by the bands around the data points. An increasing asymmetry with increasing hadron energies is visible for the U/L double ratio in both reference frames. The largest effects, but with less precision, are observed for KK pairs, for which A UL 12 is consistent with zero at low z, and reaches 22% in the last z bin, while somewhat smaller values are seen for \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 pairs. In particular, at low (z 1 , z 2 ) bins A UL for \u03c0\u03c0 pairs is nonzero, in agreement with the behavior observed in [11]. The small differences between the two data sets are due to the different kinematic region selected after the cut on cos \u03b8 th . The A UC asymmetry is smaller than A UL in all cases, and, for the KK pairs, the rise of the asymmetry with the hadron energies is not evident. We also note that the asymmetries for the KK pairs are larger than the others when the U/L ratio is considered, while they are at the same level, or lower, when they are extracted from the U/C ratio.",

We measure the azimuthal modulation of the double ratios U/L and U/C, which are sensitive to the favored and disfavored Collins FFs for light quarks. We simultaneously extract also the Collins asymmetries for \u03c0\u03c0 pairs, which are found to be in agreement with those obtained in previous studies [11,13]. The results reported in this paper and those obtained from SIDIS experiments can be used in a global analysis to extract the favored contribution of the strange quark, and to improve the knowledge on the u and d fragmentation processes [14][15][16].",
