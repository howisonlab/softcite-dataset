The contributions of \u03c9 and the \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de \u2212 \u03c9 interference are observed for the first time in the decays \u03b7 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 in both approaches. Additionally, a contribution from the box anomaly or the \u03c1\u00f01450\u00de resonance is required in the model-dependent approach, while the process specific part of the decay amplitude is determined in the model-independent approach.

            "text": "The radiative decay \u03b7 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 is the second most probable decay mode of the \u03b7 0 meson with a branching fraction of \u00f028.9 AE 0.5\u00de% [1] and is frequently used for tagging \u03b7 0 candidates. In the vector meson dominance (VMD) model [2], this process is dominated by the decay \u03b7 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1\u00f0770\u00de (hereafter referred to as \u03c1 0 ). In the past, the dipion mass distribution was studied by several experiments, e.g., JADE [3], CELLO [4], PLUTO [5], TASSO [6], TPC=\u03b3\u03b3 [7], and ARGUS [8], and a peak shift of about \u00fe20 MeV=c 2 for the \u03c1 0 meson with respect to the expected position was observed. Dedicated studies, using about 2000 \u03b7 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 events, concluded that a lone \u03c1 0 contribution in the dipion mass spectrum did not describe the experimental data [9]. This discrepancy could be attributed to a higher term of the Wess-Zumino-Witten anomaly, known as the box anomaly, in the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) Lagrangian [10]. To determine the ratio of these two contributions, it was suggested to fit the dipion invariant mass spectrum by including an extra nonresonant term in the decay amplitude to account for the box anomaly contribution [11]. Using a sample of 7490 AE 180\u03b7 0 events, evidence for the box anomaly contribution with a 4\u03c3 significance was reported by the Crystal Barrel experiment [12], whereas the observation was not confirmed by the L3 experiment [13] using 2123 AE 53 events.",

The amplitudes for \u03b7=\u03b7 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 therein are given as a product of the pion vector form factor F V \u00f0s\u00de and a reaction specific part P\u00f0s\u00de, where s is the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass squared.

The background subtracted and efficiency corrected angular distribution of \u03c0 \u00fe in the helicity frame of the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 system, j cos \u03b8 \u03c0 \u00fe j, is shown in Fig. 2. The distribution is very well described by dN=d cos \u03b8 \u03c0 \u00fe \u221d sin 2 \u03b8 \u03c0 \u00fe, which is expected for a P-wave dipion system. A detailed MC study indicates that the reconstructed \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de has a small shift with respect to the true value, and this is corrected as a function of M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de according to the values obtained in MC studies. The maximum shift is less than 0.75 MeV=c 2 . The M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de distribution with the mass shift correction is illustrated as dots with error bars in Fig. 3.",

The non-\u03b7 0 background is represented by the \u03b7 0 sideband events as discussed above, and is fixed in the fit. Fits with only the \u03c1 0 contribution and with additional \u03c1 0 -\u03c9 interference give the goodness of fit \u03c7 2 =ndf \u00bc 3365=110 and 3094=108, respectively, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom. The results indicate that these components are insufficient to describe the data and extra contributions are necessary. To improve the description of the data, we performed a fit, shown in Fig. 3(a), including the additional box anomaly term together with \u03c1 0 -\u03c9 interference, and much better agreement with \u03c7 2 =ndf \u00bc 207=107 is obtained. An alternative fit by replacing the box anomaly with the \u03c1 0 component gives considerably worse agreement with \u03c7 2 =ndf \u00bc 303=106, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Fit results of the above two cases are summarized in Table I. Both cases yield \u03c1 0 mass and width close to those in the PDG [1]. A fit including both the \u03c1 0 and box anomaly gives a reasonable goodness of fit (\u03c7 2 =ndf \u00bc 134=105). However, a very strong correlation in amplitude between the box anomaly and the \u03c1 0 components, i.e., the correlation coefficient is \u22120.986, is observed, due to the tail of the \u03c1 0 having a similar line shape as that of the box anomaly. Thus they are not well under control, and it is hard for one to distinguish them in the fitting. Whereas the mass and width of the \u03c1 0 are stable, which are 776.43 AE 0.36, 150.26 AE 0.56 MeV=c 2 , respectively. Therefore a refined model dependent amplitude beyond including just the \u03c1 0 or the box anomaly contribution is desirable.",

The uncertainty from binning is studied with the same fit procedure with varied bin width.
