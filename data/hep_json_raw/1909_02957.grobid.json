This measurement exploits B + \u2192 J/\u03c8(e + e \u2212 )K + decays, where one of the electrons is fully reconstructed and paired with the kaon, while the other electron is reconstructed using only the information of the vertex detector. Despite this partial reconstruction, kinematic and geometric constraints allow the B meson mass to be reconstructed and the signal to be well separated from backgrounds. This in turn allows the electron reconstruction efficiency to be measured by matching the partial track segment found in the vertex detector to tracks found by LHCb's regular reconstruction algorithms. The agreement between data and simulation is evaluated, and corrections are derived for simulated electrons in bins of kinematics. These correction factors allow LHCb to measure branching fractions involving single electrons with a systematic uncertainty below 1%.",

            "text": "The LHCb detector is designed for the study of b-hadron and c-hadron decays, using proton-proton collisions provided by the LHC. In order to achieve these physics goals, the trajectories of stable charged particles (tracks) need to be reconstructed accurately and with a high and well-known efficiency. The precise knowledge of this charged-particle reconstruction efficiency is essential in measurements of branching fractions, for example. While muons produced in heavy flavour decays are nearly unhindered by the LHCb detector material, electrons suffer from energy loss via bremsstrahlung. In some cases, the energy loss affects the trajectory to such a degree that the electrons no longer traverse all tracking detectors. Therefore, the track-reconstruction efficiency for electrons describes not only the performance of the trackreconstruction algorithms for electrons, but also the impact of this loss in geometrical acceptance.",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [4,5] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector, called the VELO, surrounding the pp interaction region [6], a large-area siliconstrip detector, the TT, located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm; and three stations of silicon-strip detectors (Inner Tracker) and straw drift tubes (Outer Tracker) [7] placed downstream of the magnet, referred to as the T stations. The complete tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. The IP is exploited to discriminate prompt tracks from heavy flavour decays. The dipole magnet deflects oppositely charged particles in opposite directions. Its polarity is periodically reversed throughout the data-taking. The configuration with the magnetic field pointing upwards (downwards), bends positively (negatively) charged particles in the horizontal plane towards the centre of the LHC ring. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ringimaging Cherenkov detectors [8]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [9].",

The resulting primary vertices are reconstructed using a seeding and fitting procedure, optimised for vertices distributed nearby the beam line [10]. The resolution of the reconstructed PVs depends on the track multiplicity of the PV is presented in ref. [11]. Figure 1 shows an overview of the relevant track types used in this paper: VELO tracks, composed of at least three hits in the VELO detector; and long tracks, which have hits in the VELO detector, T stations and optionally the TT detector. The momentum is inferred from the track's curvature in the magnetic field. Most physics analyses make use of long tracks, as they provide the best momentum and angular resolution among all of the track types. The VELO resides outside the magnetic field, and charged particles follow an approximately straight trajectory through the detector. Therefore, a VELO track only provides angular information about the particle's initial trajectory, and no information about the particle's absolute momentum. The reconstruction of long tracks starts with the reconstruction of VELO tracks, which are subsequently promoted by dedicated algorithms to long tracks [12,13]. Consequently, all long tracks must also satisfy the conditions of the VELO track reconstruction. The trigger [14] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which performs a full event reconstruction. This analysis uses specific trigger selections deployed for 2017 data taking which build the tag-and-probe candidates required for the analysis at the trigger level. In order to minimize potential correlations between the tag and probe sides of the signal candidate, the trigger selection is based on a minimal set of criteria required to reduce the output rate to an acceptable level.",

The decay products cover the momentum spectrum of interest to most analyses studying properties of heavy flavour in LHCb, with a typical average transverse momentum of a few GeV/c. One of the electrons and the kaon from the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 e + e \u2212 )K + decay are reconstructed as long tracks and define the tag candidate, while the other electron is reconstructed in the VELO and defines the probe candidate. The angular information of the VELO track combined with the information of the tag particles is sufficient to distinguish genuine signal decays from backgrounds, as illustrated in section 3.2. The long-track reconstruction efficiency for electrons is obtained by matching the VELO track to a long track. The probe track is defined as matched if a long track is found which has at least 70% of the clusters in the VELO detector in common, with a minimum of 6 shared clusters on a track.2 As an additional quality requirement, the reconstructed long track is required to have the correct electric charge associated, i.e. opposite to the charge of the tag electron.",

As the resulting uncertainty is smaller than the statistical uncertainties, the bin migration is treated as a systematic error, and no effort is taken to unfold the p T distribution. The resulting systematic uncertainty is O(0.15%) on average, but varies up to 2.5% in a region of phase-space with large statistical uncertainties on the measured ratios and a strong variation in the efficiency.",

Results using part of the data recorded in 2017 show a large variation of this efficiency over phase-space, comparable but not equal to the results from simulation. To provide a suitable correction for physics analyses, only the ratio between the reconstruction efficiency of electrons in data and simulation is relevant, in which systematic uncertainties are mitigated. The average systematic uncertainty on this ratio is 0.6% per track and varies with phase-space.",
