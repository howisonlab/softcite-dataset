The electromagnetic contribution from all other solar neutrino fluxes is negligible and is not considered in the fit. Including the electromagnetic component described by (2) in the pp-neutrino cross-section leads to a decrease of the pp-neutrino flux in the fit, compensating for the increase in the total cross section. Another important correlation arises from the presence of 85 Kr in the fitting function. An increase in the 7 Be rate due to the electromagnetic interactions is compensated for by a decrease in the 85 Kr counting rate. These two correlations in the fit decrease the overall sensitivity to the magnetic moment. The contribution from 85 Kr could be constrained from an independent measurement using a delayed coincidence, but the combination of a very low branching ratio of 0.4%, low tagging efficiency (\u223c18%), and a relatively low 85 Kr rate lead to very low statistics in the coincidence branch [21]. As a result, constraining 85 Kr doesn't improve the sensitivity. On the other hand, the correlation between the magnetic moment and the pp-neutrino flux can be constrained by applying the results from radiochemical experiments, which are independent to the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, to the sum of the neutrino fluxes detected in Borexino.",

Though P 2\u03bd depends on E \u03bd , the difference between P 2\u03bd (400) = 0.57 for a neutrino energy close to the pp-neutrino spectrum end-point of 420 keV (only a small fraction of the total pp-neutrino spectrum close to the end-point contributes to the sensitive region in our analysis) and P 2\u03bd (862) = 0.55 for 7 Be-neutrinos (higher energy line) is negligible. Moreover, tests performed by \"turning on\" separately the pp and 7 Be neutrino magnetic moments demonstrates that sensitivity to the magnetic moment is dominated by the 7 Be-neutrino contribution.

A new model independent limit of \u00b5 ef f \u03bd <2.8\u202210 \u221211 \u00b5 B is obtained at 90% C.L. including systematics. The limit is free from uncertainties associated with predictions from the SSM neutrino flux and systematics from the detector's FV and is obtained by constraining the sum of the solar neutrino fluxes using the results from gallium experiments. The limit on the effective neutrino moment for solar neutrinos was used to set new limits on the magnetic moments for the neutrino flavor states and for the elements of the neutrino magnetic moments matrix for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.",
