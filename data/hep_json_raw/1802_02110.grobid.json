            "text": "A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is performed in final states comprising one or more jets and missing transverse momentum using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The number of signal events is found to agree with the expected background yields from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of SUSY that assume the production of gluino or squark pairs and their prompt decay to quarks and the lightest neutralino. The masses of bottom, top, and mass-degenerate light-flavour squarks are probed up to 1050, 1000, and 1325 GeV, respectively. The gluino mass is probed up to 1900, 1650, and 1650 GeV when the gluino decays via virtual states of the aforementioned squarks. The strongest mass bounds on the neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV, respectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models inspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived gluinos. Values of the proper decay length c\u03c4 0 from 10 \u22123 to 10 5 mm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to 1750 and 900 GeV are probed for c\u03c4 0 = 1 mm and for the metastable state, respectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for c\u03c4 0 1 m. The search provides coverage of the c\u03c4 0 parameter space for models involving long-lived gluinos that is complementary to existing techniques at the LHC.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4] is an extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics that introduces at least one bosonic (fermionic) superpartner for each fermionic (bosonic) SM particle, where the superpartner differs in its spin from its SM counterpart by one half unit. Supersymmetry offers a potential solution to the hierarchy problem [5,6], predicts unification of the gauge couplings at high energy [7][8][9], and provides a candidate for dark matter (DM). Under the assumption of R-parity [10] conservation, SUSY particles are expected to be produced in pairs at the CERN LHC and to decay to the stable, lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The LSP is assumed to be the neutralino \u03c7 0 1 , a weakly interacting massive particle and a viable DM candidate [11,12]. So-called natural SUSY models, which invoke only a minimal fine tuning of the bare Higgs boson mass parameter, require only the gluino, third-generation squarks, and a higgsino-like \u03c7 0 1 to have masses at or -1 -",

The characteristic signature of natural SUSY production at the LHC is a final state containing an abundance of jets originating from the hadronization of heavy-flavour quarks and significant missing transverse momentum p miss T . Split supersymmetry [20,21] does not address the hierarchy problem -in contrast to natural SUSY models -but preserves the appealing aspects of gauge coupling unification and a DM candidate. In such a model, only the fermionic superpartners, and a finely tuned scalar Higgs boson, may be realized at a mass scale that is kinematically accessible at the LHC. All other SUSY particles are assumed to be ultraheavy. Hence, within split SUSY models, the gluino decay is suppressed because of the highly virtual squark states. For gluino lifetimes beyond a picosecond, the gluino hadronizes and forms a bound coloursinglet state containing the gluino and quarks or gluons [22], known as an R-hadron, before eventually decaying to a quark-antiquark pair and the \u03c7 0",

The search is performed with a sample of protonproton (pp) collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016. The analysed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 \u00b1 0.9 fb \u22121 [23]. Earlier searches using the same technique have been performed in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration [24][25][26][27][28][29]. The data set analysed in this analysis is a factor of 16 larger than that presented in ref. [29]. The search strategy aims to provide sensitivity to a broad range of SUSY-inspired models that predict the existence of a DM candidate, and the search is used to constrain the parameter spaces of a number of simplified SUSY models [30][31][32]. The overwhelmingly dominant background for a new-physics search in all-jet final states resulting from pp collisions is the production of multijet events via the strong interaction, a manifestation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Several dedicated variables are employed to suppress the multijet background to a negligible level while maintaining low kinematical thresholds and high experimental acceptance for final states characterized by the presence of significant p miss T . Signal extraction is performed using additional kinematical variables, namely the number of jets, the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, and the scalar and vector sums of the jet transverse momenta. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have performed similar searches in all-jet final states at \u221a s = 13 TeV, of which those providing the tightest constraints are described in refs. [33][34][35]. This search does not employ specialized reconstruction techniques [36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] that target long-lived gluinos.",

In this process, the identification of the particle type (photon, electron, muon, charged hadron, neutral hadron) plays an important role in the determination of the particle direction and energy. The energy of photons [50] is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons [51] is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL measurement, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons [52] is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. The reconstruction techniques used by this search are not specialized to target specific experimental signatures (such as displaced jets). The physics objects used in this search are defined below and are summarized in table 1. In the case of photons and leptons, further details can be found in ref. [29] and references therein.",

Photons are required to be isolated [50] within a cone around the photon trajectory defined by the radius \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 = 0.3, where \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206\u03b7 represent differences in the azimuthal angle (radians) and pseudorapidity. Isolation for an electron or muon is a relative quantity, I rel , defined as the scalar p T sum of all PF particle candidates within a cone around its trajectory, divided by the lepton p T . The cone radius is dependent on the lepton p T , \u2206R = min[max(0.05, 10 GeV/p T ), 0.2], to maintain high efficiency for semileptonic decays of Lorentz-boosted top quarks [56]. Isolated electrons and muons are required to satisfy I rel < 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Electron and muon candidates that fail any of the aforementioned requirements, as well as charged-hadron candidates from hadronically decaying tau leptons, are collectively labelled as single isolated tracks (SITs) if the scalar p T sum of additional tracks associated with the PV within a cone \u2206R < 0.3 around the track trajectory, relative to the track p T , satisfies I track < 0.1. All isolation variables exclude the contributions from the physics object itself and pileup interactions [50-52].

An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contributions from neutral particles produced in pileup interactions [55,57]. The raw jet energies are then corrected to establish a relative uniform response of the calorimeter in \u03b7 and a calibrated absolute response in p T . Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3+jets, and leptonically decaying Z+jets events [58]. Jets are required to satisfy p T > 40 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.

Events in both samples are categorized according to n jet , H T , and n b , with counts integrated over H miss T . The n jet categorization is identical to the SR. Background predictions are determined using up to eleven bins in H T that are then aggregated to match the H T binning schema used by the SR. The n b categorization for \u00b5+jets events is identical to the SR, whereas \u00b5\u00b5+jets events are subdivided according to n b = 0 and n b \u2265 1.

Simulated W+jets and Z+jets events are weighted according to the true vector boson p T to account for the effect of missing next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD and EW terms in the matrix-element calculation [64,65], according to the method described in ref. [66]. Within the range of vector boson p T that can be probed by this search, the QCD and EW corrections [65] are largest, \u224840% and \u224815%, at low and high values of boson p T , respectively. Simulated tt events are weighted to improve the description of jets arising from initial-state radiation (ISR) [67]. The weights vary from 0.92 to 0.51 depending on the number of jets (1-6) from ISR, with an uncertainty of one half the deviation from unity. The MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator is used at NLO accuracy to generate samples of s-channel production of single top quark, as well as ttW and ttZ events. The NLO powheg v2 [68,69] generator is used to describe the t-and Wt-channel production of events containing single top quarks, as well as ttH events.

            "text": "The rhadrons package within the pythia 8.205 program is used to describe the formation of R-hadrons through the hadronization of gluinos [22,85,86]. The hadronization process, steered according to the default parameter settings of the rhadrons package, predominantly yields meson-like ( gqq) and baryon-like ( gqqq) states, as well as glueballlike ( gg) states with a probability P gg = 10%, where g, g, q, and q represent a gluino, gluon, quark, and antiquark, respectively. The gluino is assumed to undergo a three-body decay, to a qq pair and the \u03c7 0 1 , according to its proper decay length c\u03c4 0 that is a parameter of the simplified model [87]. Studies with alternative values for parameters that influence the hadronization of the gluino, such as P gg = 50%, indicate a minimal influence on the event topology and kinematical variables for the models considered in this paper. Further, the model-dependent interactions of R-hadrons with the detector material are not considered by default, as studies demonstrate that the sensitivity of this search is only moderately dependent on these interactions, as discussed in section 8.",

These models assume the production of long-lived gluino pairs that decay to final states containing displaced jets and p miss T from the undetected \u03c7 0 1 particles. The long-lived gluino, with an assumed proper decay length c\u03c4 0 , is expected to hadronize with SM particles and form a bound state known as an R-hadron. The model-dependent matter interactions of R-hadrons are not considered by default. The sensitivity of this search is only moderately dependent on these matter interactions for models with c\u03c4 0 1 m, while no dependence is found for models with c\u03c4 0 below 1 m. Models that assume a \u03c7 0 1 mass of 100 GeV and gluino masses up to 1600 GeV are excluded for a proper decay length c\u03c4 0 below 0.1 mm. The bound on the gluino mass strengthens to 1750 GeV at c\u03c4 0 = 1 mm, before weakening to 900-1000 GeV for models with c\u03c4 0 > 10 m. For all values of c\u03c4 0 considered, the exclusion bounds on the gluino mass weaken to about 1 TeV when the difference between the gluino and \u03c7 0 1 mass is small. The search provides coverage of the c\u03c4 0 parameter space for models involving long-lived gluinos, such as the region c\u03c4 0 1 mm, that is complementary to the coverage provided by dedicated techniques at the LHC.",
