The measured values of the Michel parameters are\u03b7 = \u22121.3 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 and \u03be\u03ba = 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.2, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. This is the first measurement of these parameters. These results are consistent with the Standard Model predictions within their uncertainties, and constrain the coupling constants of the generalized weak interaction.",

The achieved instantaneous luminosity of 2.11 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is the world record.

The world's largest sample of \u03c4 leptons collected at Belle provides a unique opportunity to study radiative leptonic decay of \u03c4 .

This effective description can generally discard information about correlations in the phase space and thereby give significant bias. The residuals of the fitted Michel parameters from the SM prediction obtained by the fit to the MC distribution are taken as the corresponding systematic uncertainties.  Other notable uncertainties come from the accuracy of the measured branching ratios. In particular, the uncertainties of the branching ratios of the radiative decay \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4\u03bd \u03b3 dominate. The systematic effects of the cluster merging in the ECL are evaluated as a function of the angle between the photon and lepton clusters at the inner surface of ECL (\u03b8 ECL \u03b3 ). The limit \u03b8 ECL \u03b3 \u2192 0 represents the merger of the two clusters, and the comparison of the distribution between experiment and MC gives us the corresponding bias. A systematic effect due to the detector resolution is evaluated by comparing Michel parameters obtained in the fit with and without account of the resolution function.",

However, in the real experiment, we cannot precisely determine this energy because the \u03c4 \u2212 momentum is not directly reconstructed. Accordingly, there is a chance that an event that has a photon with an energy less than the threshold is also reconstructed as signal. This is only possible in a limited phase space, and such events are included in the selection with the fractions of 1.1% and 0.3% for electron and muon events, respectively. We take these fractions as sources of systematic effects due to the uncertainty of the experimental E * \u03b3 threshold.",
