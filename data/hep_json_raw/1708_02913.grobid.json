Measurements have been carried out at different center-of-mass energies in proton collisions and in collisions involving heavy ions. These include precision measurements of cross sections and polarizations, shedding light on hadroproduction mechanisms, and the observation of quarkonium sequential suppression, a notable indication of quark-gluon plasma formation. The observation of the production of bottomonium pairs is also reported along with searches for new states. We close with a brief outlook of the future physics program.",

            "text": "Bottomonia, bound states bb of a bottom quark and its antiparticle, constitute the heaviest meson system. The only heavier quark, the top quark, decays before it can hadronize. Light quark (u, d, s) constituents in mesons typically move at relativistic speeds as their masses are considerably smaller than the meson masses. Heavy quarkonia, charmonia and especially bottomonia, are in contrast approximately non-relativistic systems. This allows in turn the application of effective theoretical approaches to describe nonperturbative effects in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As a result, heavy quarkonia provide a valuable framework for probing the strong interaction as described by QCD within the Standard Model (SM) and for searching for new phenomena.",

A most complete approach is provided by nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), 1,2 which implements a factorization of the perturbative and nonperturbative terms. The latter are expressed in terms of long-distance matrix elements, assumed to be universal. Several effective QCD models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] of quarkonium production predict different cross sections and polarizations. The thorough measurement of these observables plays a crucial role in advancing the theoretical understanding of the quarkonium production mechanisms.",

The charged particles produced in the collisions leave trajectories in the CMS all-silicon Tracker. The particle momentum is precisely measured in the 3.8 T axial magnetic field. Since the start of its operation, several large data sets have been delivered by the LHC. The integrated luminosity recorded by CMS is shown in Fig. 3. 31 Early into the start of the LHC data taking in 2010, a full spectrum of the dimuon invariant mass was reconstructed by CMS. As evidenced in Fig. 4, even with an initial data set corresponding to a few hundred nb \u22121 , CMS was able to observe many SM particles, in a wide mass range from the \u03c9 to the Z boson. The figure essentially combines many particle physics discoveries of the past 50 years into a single picture.  Fig. 4. Dimuon invariant mass spectrum at CMS. Top left: 32 first version of the spectrum plot, produced with the very first LHC data, collected in 2010 and corresponding to 280 nb \u22121 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Bottom left: 33 the most recent version, produced with a data set of 13.1 fb \u22121 \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2016, which also highlights the dedicated heavy-flavor triggers in use by the experiment.

The similarities and differences among them are discussed in detail elsewhere. 34 These models provide different predictions for the quarkonium production cross sections and polarizations. Bottomonium states are heavier and more non-relativistic than charmonium states, so the comparison between experiment and theory is expected to be more reliable for bottomonium. 35 A precise measurement of bottomonium production is thus crucial for distinguishing among the models.",

The acceptance as a function of \u03a5 p T is shown in Fig. 6 (left). 43 The seemingly peculiar form of this graph shows that, when the \u03a5 is produced at rest, both muons are likely to reach the muon detector and pass the p \u00b5 T threshold.

The results agree within uncertainties in the |y| < 2 region; for example, \u03c3(pp \u2192 \u03a5(1S)X) \u2022 B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 7.50 \u00b1 0.05 (stat.) nb. is statistically compatible with the result in Eq. (3). The differential cross sections, corrected for acceptance and efficiency, as a function of \u03a5 p T and y are shown in Fig. 8. 45 The comparisons of the measured results with the CASCADE 46 MC generator, the CEM model without feed-down, 13 NRQCD COM at next-to-leading order (NLO) including feed-down, 12 CSM to NLO, and NNLO*, 10 are also shown in the figure. The cross sections reported above assume unpolarized production. Polarization affects the spatial distribution of the two muons from the \u03a5 decay, and therefore the fraction of the signal that is in the detector acceptance region. For extreme assumptions for the polarization, i.e. either fully transverse or fully longitudinal, the cross section results vary by about \u00b120%. A fiducial cross section may be defined as the \u03a5 yields corrected only by the efficiency but not by the geometric acceptance, which can be used to compare with theoretical models without making any assumption for the polarization. The product of the fiducial \u03a5(nS) cross section and dimuon branching fraction is: 45 As p T increases, higher-order corrections become more significant in several of the theoretical models. Therefore, cross section measurements in high p T regions are important for distinguishing among the models. The CMS analysis was further expanded using the full 4.9 fb \u22121 pp collision data taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV in 2011 with the p T coverage increased to 100 GeV. 47 Figure 9 (left) 47 shows the differential cross section as a function of p T from the two groups of data, one integrated over the rapidity range of |y| < 1.2 (CMS 2011, black dots) and the other scaled to the same range (CMS 2010, cross-hatched areas). The solid lines are the NLO NRQCD color-octet calculations from Ref. 48, with the range of p T further extended to p T < 100 GeV by the corresponding authors, which describe the trends of the data points for all the three \u03a5 states. This significant increase of the p T range is also useful in studying the p T dependence in other models.",

This was the first result of the \u03a5 cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV reported by CMS. 49  An analysis strategy similar to the one previously described was used: dimuons were selected in the central rapidity region, |y| < 1.2, and tighter muon p T acceptance thresholds were adopted, namely p \u00b5 T > 4.5 (4.0) GeV for |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 0.3 (0.3 < |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 1.4). The p T reach attained with this measurement based on the initial data is already 100 GeV, and will increase with enlarged Run 2 datasets. While the focus is in the high p T region, a lower threshold is effectively imposed from tightening trigger rate requirements. This measurement is reported from an \u03a5 p T of 20 GeV. The results are shown in Fig. 9 (right), 49 where a comparison of the \u03a5(nS) differential cross sections for the 7 and 13 TeV data sets is also given. The cross sections for all bottomonium states at 13 TeV are larger than the corresponding cross sections at 7 TeV by a factor of two to three. This increase is expected from the \u221a s-induced variation in the parton distribution functions, and is confirmed by simulations using the PYTHIA 8 description.

The polarization parameters depend on the reference frame in which they are measured. The three most commonly used reference frames are the helicity frame (HX), where the z-axis coincides with the \u03a5 momentum direction in the collision center-of-mass frame; the Collins-Soper (CS) frame, 56 where the z-axis is chosen as the bisector of the two beam directions in the \u03a5 rest frame; and the perpendicular helicity (PX) frame, 57 which is orthogonal to the CS frame. The y-axis is always taken along the direction of the vector product of the two beam directions in the \u03a5 rest frame. In addition, one can define some observables that do not depend on the frame in which they are measured. The bottomonium states are heavier and satisfy the non-relativistic approximation better than charmonium states. Measurements of the \u03a5 states, especially in the high p T region, are thus expected to provide more robust tests of NRQCD. Earlier measurements from CDF 37 and D0 58 collaborations were found to be in disagreement with the theoretical predictions, and also disagreed to some degree between the two experiments. In these earlier measurements only the \u03bb \u03b8 parameter was extracted, in a single polarization frame. CMS measured all the polarization parameters \u03bb \u03b8 , \u03bb \u03c6 , and \u03bb \u03b8\u03c6 , in the complementary polarization frames mentioned above, as well as the frame-invariant quantity\u03bb = (\u03bb \u03b8 + 3\u03bb \u03c6 )/(1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c6 ), using the pp data sample at \u221a s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb \u22121 . 59 Figure 12 shows the \u03bb \u03b8 , \u03bb \u03c6 , and \u03bb \u03b8\u03c6 measurements as function of p T , 59 for the \u03a5(nS) states in the HX frame, in the rapidity range |y| < 0.6. Measurements in complementary kinematic regions and reference frames were also performed. The frame-invariant parameters\u03bb for the three \u03a5 states were also studied as a function of the \u03a5(nS) p T , and are in good agreement in the HX, CS, and PX frames. 59 All polarization parameters are compatible with zero or small values in the three polarization frames.",

            "text": "Quarks and gluons are normally bound together to form composite particles. However, QCD allows for strongly interacting matter to undergo a phase transition to an unbound (deconfined) state at sufficiently high temperature and density. The unique medium of quarks and gluons in this deconfined state where the partons are no longer confined to hadrons is referred to as the quark-gluon plasma. This medium can be produced in heavy ion collisions, where once the heavy quarkonium states are formed they are expected to unbind due to the strong interactions with partons in the medium through a QCD Debye screening mechanism. 14 Above a certain temperature, the weaker bound states, such as \u03a5(3S), are expected to unbind more completely compared to the more strongly bound states, e.g. \u03a5(1S). At even higher temperatures, more of the weakly bound states are expected to dissolve. In the experiment, this sequential unbinding (also referred to as melting) of quarkonium states is expected to be observed as a sequential suppression of their yields. The suppression of heavy quarkonium states was accordingly proposed as the smoking-gun signature of the phase transition, and its sequential pattern as a probe of the medium temperature. 14,61,62 The NA50 63-65 and NA60 66 experiments at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, and the PHENIX 15 and STAR 67 experiments at BNL RHIC had measured suppression of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) yields in heavy ion collisions. However, these experiments were not able to carry out quantitative studies of the \u03a5(nS) states. Bottomonium states are regarded as better probes because recombination effects are believed to be much less significant than in the charmonia case. 68 Although the recombination effect is expected to increase for bottomonia from RHIC to LHC energies, it is predicted to remain small. 69 The first indication of \u03a5 suppression in heavy ion collisions was reported by CMS in 2011. 61,70,71 This result is based on data collected during the first LHC PbPb run in 2010 and a special pp run in 2011, at the same 2.76 TeV center-of-mass collision energy per nucleon pair ( \u221a s N N ). The PbPb and pp data sets correspond to integrated luminosities of 7.3 \u00b5b \u22121 and 230 nb \u22121 , respectively. Thanks to the good momentum resolution of the CMS detector and the large event samples, the three \u03a5 resonances observed in the dimuon mass spectrum were well separated for both PbPb and pp. Similar techniques were applied to the two data sets to extract yields and calculate cross sections. The results are shown in Fig. 14, 72 where the solid (blue) line represents the fit to the mass spectrum in PbPb, and the dashed (red) line represents the line-shape from the fit to the pp data. In this figure, all three \u03a5(nS) peaks are normalized such that the \u03a5(1S) yield in the pp line-shape matches the \u03a5(1S) yield in the PbPb fit. The \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) resonances in PbPb collisions are clearly more strongly suppressed than the \u03a5(1S), compared with the pp result. The statistical significance of the effect has been evaluated to be 2.4 \u03c3. The double ratio, [\u03a5(2S + 3S)/\u03a5(1S)] PbPb /[\u03a5(2S + 3S)/\u03a5(1S)] pp , measured in the kinematic region defined by p \u00b5 T > 4 GeV and |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 2.4, is found to be 0.31 +0.19 \u22120.15 (stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.), 61 significantly smaller than unity. Besides the hot-nuclear-matter (HNM), corresponding to the QGP, the suppression of \u03a5 production can also be caused by cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects. 73 But the CNM effects cancel to first order in the \u03a5 double ratio measurements. For example, one of the initial-state effects, \"shadowing,\" 73 is expected to suppress all three \u03a5 resonances by almost the same factor, so it has a small impact on their ratio. One of the final-state effects, \"nuclear absorption,\" 73 is expected to be less important at LHC collision energies. (To further probe CNM effects, measurements in proton-lead collisions are conducted as described in Sec. 3.2.) Other effects that could affect the suppression measurements, such as differences in the detector acceptance and efficiency, are similar for the different \u03a5 states and largely cancel in the double ratio analysis.",

Figure 16 shows the \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) R AA versus rapidity (left plot) and transverse momentum (middle plot). Centrality is an important parameter in QGP matter studies because it is directly related to the overlap region of the colliding nuclei. It is determined from the energy deposits in the forward calorimeter, 76 starting from 0% for the most central collisions. With Glauber model calculations, 77,78 the centrality variable can be expressed in terms of the number of nucleons participating in the collisions, N part .

A comparison between pPb/pp and PbPb/pp double ratios is provided in Fig. 19. 84 The \u03a5(nS)/\u03a5(1S) single ratios were also studied in the three collision systems, along with their dependency on event activity variables. In the left panel of Fig. 20, 84 the ratios are plotted with respect to the raw transverse energy deposited in the most forward part of the hadron calorimeters at 4.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2, while in the right panel, the ratios are plotted with respect to the number of charged particle tracks, excluding the two muons, with p T > 400 MeV and at |\u03b7| < 2.4. The tracks are required to originate from the same vertex as the muon pairs. tracks . The \u03a5(nS) mesons are required to satisfy p T > 7 GeV and |y| < 1.2. Error bars represent statistical uncertainties, while empty squares show the systematic uncertainties. 95 The decrease of the \u03a5(2S)/\u03a5(1S) ratio in Fig. 20 may indicate the presence of some new phenomena in quarkonium production in pp collisions. Other results recently published by the LHC experiments [85][86][87][88][89][90] can also be interpreted as hints of collective effects in the high multiplicity pp environment at the attained energies. 91,92 However, it is still not clear whether the medium produced in pp collisions could undergo a phase transition, as observed in PbPb collisions.",

The production ratios \u03c7 c2 /\u03c7 c1 have been measured by CMS, 96 LHCb, 97 and ATLAS, 98 providing valuable insight into the quarkonium production mechanism. The \u03c7 b1,b2 production cross section measurement is also important since it is particularly sensitive to color-octet contributions. 99,100 The measurement is challenging because of the small separation (only 19.4 MeV) between the \u03c7 b1 (1P ) and the \u03c7 b2 (1P ) peaks, as well as their small cross sections. The P -wave bottomonium production cross section ratio, \u03c3(\u03c7 b2 (1P ))/\u03c3(\u03c7 b1 (1P )), was measured with the 20.7 fb \u22121 pp collision data taken at \u221a s = 8 TeV. 100 The \u03c7 b1 (1P ) and \u03c7 b2 (1P ) states are detected through their radiative decays \u03c7 b1,2 (1P ) \u2192 \u03a5(1S) \u03b3, where the \u03a5(1S) decays to two muons, and the photon is reconstructed through its conversion to a e + e \u2212 pair in the inner layers of the tracker. Although the yield of reconstructed conversion photons is  100 The vertical error bars represent the statistical (inner bars) and total (outer bars) uncertainties. The dashed horizontal line is a fit of a constant to the CMS result and the horizontal band is the total uncertainty of the fit, which does not include the 9% uncertainty in the ratio of branching fractions. The band represents the ratio predicted by a theoretical calculation. 102 small, the four-momentum of the photon can be precisely determined through a fit to the electron and positron tracks in the tracker. With this strategy, the resulting mass resolution (of the order of 5 MeV) of the \u03c7 b candidates is sufficient to separate the \u03c7 b1 (1P ) and \u03c7 b2 (1P ) peaks.",

            "text": "The measurement of quarkonium pairs originating from a common vertex in pp collisions provides additional insight into the underlying mechanisms of particle production at the LHC. The study of quarkonium pair production is essential to understand contributions of SPS (single-parton scattering) and DPS (double-parton scattering) processes. It also forms the baseline for the search of quarkonium pair resonances, which are predicted by several studies. 103,104 In this section, the first observation and cross section measurement of \u03a5(1S) pair production, reported by Proton collisions at hadron colliders are described by parton models. Each colliding hadron is characterized as a collection of free elementary constituents. In a single hadron-hadron collision, two partons often undergo a single interaction (SPS), although the composite nature of hadrons permits multiple distinct interactions (multiple-parton interactions or MPIs) to occur, the simplest case being DPS. The SPS mechanism for heavy quarkonium pair production can be described to a good extent by the NRQCD COM approach. 11 However, contributions from the DPS mechanism are not easily addressed within this framework, 106 and DPS or MPIs are sometimes invoked to account for observations that cannot be explained otherwise. 107 Heavy quarkonium states are expected to probe the distribution of gluons in the proton since their production is dominated by gluon-gluon interactions. 108,109 The large event samples at the LHC enable a search for exotic states decaying into heavy quarkonium, such as tetra-bottom or tetra-charm quark states, and a measurement of the double \u03a5 cross section provides a benchmark measurement for these searches. 104,110 In the CMS pair production study, 105 each pp collision is scanned for a signature of four-muon candidates with the sum of muon charges equal to zero. To ensure a uniform muon acceptance and a well-defined kinematic region, selected muons are required to be within |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 2.4 and have p T > 3. 5 GeV. An \u03a5 candidate is reconstructed by combining two oppositely charged muons that originate from a common vertex. In constructing the \u03a5\u03a5 candidates, the two pairs of muons are assigned as (i) the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass of the higher-mass \u03a5 candidate, M \u00b5\u00b5 . Figure 24 shows 105 the projec-tion of the invariant mass distributions of the higher and lower mass muon pairs in the data with the superimposed 2D fit. The efficiency and acceptance of the detector are computed with a data-embedding method that repeatedly substitutes the measured muon four-momenta into different simulated events, which are then subjected to the complete CMS detector simulation and reconstruction chain.",

In addition, quarkonium states can be explored as final states in the search for new particles and rare processes. Studies of di-quarkonium production, such as reported in Sec. 5, open new opportunities to search for possible exotic resonance states decaying to quarkonium pairs. In the bottomonium case reported above, one may probe for four b-quark bound states. 104,110 Various unexpected quarkonium-like states have been identified since the discovery of the X(3872) state by BELLE more than a decade ago. 118 This exotic charmonium was discovered in the final state J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , tagged through B meson decays, and its prompt production has been confirmed by various experiments, including CMS. 119 A search is conducted for an exotic bottomonium counterpart. 120 This is done probing the corresponding final state \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , as shown in Fig. 25  (right). Besides the excited \u03a5 states that are expected (Fig. 2) and appear prominently in the spectrum, no excess is detected over background, despite the analysis having the sensitivity for detecting such a state if its relative strength were comparable to the corresponding value for the X(3872).

The CMS detector acceptance, trigger, and reconstruction capabilities have allowed the prompt collection of large data sets containing dimuon signals, down to low transverse momenta, resulting in the ability to probe a wide mass spectrum as shown in Fig. 4. While the muon detectors contribute particle identification and the seeds for online selection, the silicon tracker allows for precise kinematic and topological reconstruction of particle decays. In particular, the precision achieved allows for separately identifying lightest three \u03a5(nS) states -a capability that is fully exploited in the measurements reported here.",

Cross sections are among the first results extracted with initial data, both in LHC's Run 1 and Run 2 data-taking periods. Measurements in pp collisions at the unprecedented center-of-mass energies of 2.76, 5.02, 7, 8, and 13 TeV have been undertaken, within the rapidity window of |y| < 2.4, and dimuon momenta up to 100 GeV. Cross sections and cross section ratios have been measured for S-wave and P -wave states. In addition, the angular distribution of the final-state muons has been analyzed in complementary reference frames, resulting in detailed measurements of the polarization parameters. This measurement has been reported for all three S-wave states. The cross sections and the polarizations, combined in global fits, have shed considerable light on the QCD production mechanisms, contributing towards the resolution of the \"quarkonium puzzle\". Analysis of new LHC data will extend the kinematic reach of the measurements and, in addition, extend the cross section and polarization measurements to the P -wave states. These will be important pieces in the puzzle, and will allow the disentanglement of the P -to S-wave feed-down contributions, thus granting access to directly produced bottomonia.",

The considerable jump in collision energy and detector capability, as compared to previous heavy ion experiments, has placed CMS in a privileged position to explore the bottomonium sector in nuclear collisions. In particular, the experiment has delivered the first complete measurements of the individual states of the \u03a5 family in collisions involving heavy ions. Foremost, the ability to separately identify the individual \u03a5(nS) states has been explored to probe their relative suppression. Such a novel and robust analysis has experimentally established the pattern of sequential suppression, wherein the excited states are more suppressed than the smaller, more strongly bound states. The absolute suppression, in PbPb with respect to pp, of the individual states has also been assessed. Detailed measurements of bottomonia, in PbPb but also pPb and pp, have probed (hot and cold) nuclear and environment effects. The analysis of larger LHC data sets will explore P -wave states, quantifying the suppression of higher-mass states and their feed-down contribution to the inclusive measurements of the lighter ones. It will allow also to explore new observables, such as azimuthal anisotropies and polarizations through angular analyses, and to perform further studies of kinematic, angular, and environment dependencies. The continued exploration of the bottomonium sector, through more precise and new measurements, across different collisions systems and energies, will provide a more complete understanding of the underlying processes contributing to quarkonium production and suppression, and a more complete characterization of the properties of the hot medium attained with LHC collisions. Bottomonia can be explored in addition via photoproduction in collisions of protons or ions at the LHC. In such exclusive collisions, the incoming hadrons remain intact after the interaction and no other particles are produced, e.g. pA \u2192 pA\u03a5. 121 Such studies will offer a clean probe of the structure of the target hadron (A).",

At the same time, such studies of associated production open an interesting window into the spectroscopy realm, forming the basis for the search for new and exotic states.
