            "text": "The decays of the \u03c4 lepton into three pseudoscalar particles can provide information on hadronic form factors, K * resonance spectroscopy, and the Wess-Zumino anomaly [1], and also can be used for studies of CP violation in the leptonic sector [2]. By studying decays into final states that contain one or three kaons, it is possible to extract strange spectral functions, which can be used for a direct determination of the strange quark mass and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element |V us | [3][4][5]. These three hadron decays have been studied since the initial discovery of the \u03c4 lepton, but only the decay to three charged pions has been closely investigated. Even for this mode, measurements of its branching fraction have only been provided by the CLEO [6] and BaBar [7] groups. For all other modes, there are still many unresolved problems. For example, the branching fraction for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay recently measured by the BaBar collaboration [7] is significantly lower than the values from most previous measurements [8]; there is large scatter in the measured central values, which is reflected in the large scale factor (2.1) applied by the Particle Data Group when forming their average [8]. Intermediate two-and three-body resonance states in this decay have been previously studied but only with limited statistical precision, see, e.g., Refs [9][10][11]. There is evidence for quite rich dynamics, with strong signals for the K 1 (1270), K 1 (1400) and K * (1410) resonances in the three-body final state; other resonances can be seen in various two-body sub-systems. Theoretically, two intermediate resonances, the \u03c1(770) 0 and K * (892) 0 (or its excitations), are expected to contribute to \u03c4 decay into K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 : \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c1(770) 0 (\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03bd \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 (\u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 [12]. These are shown in Figs 1(a) and (b), respectively.",

We use events where the number of charged tracks is four and the sum of their charges is zero; the transverse momentum of each track in the laboratory frame is required to be larger than 0.1 GeV/c, and the tracks should extrapolate back to the interaction point within \u00b15 cm along the beam direction and \u00b11 cm in the transverse plane. The sum of the reconstructed momenta in the center-of-mass (CM) frame is required to be less than 10 GeV/c, and the sum of energies deposited in the calorimeter is required to be less than 10 GeV. The largest of the four tracks' transverse momenta is required to be greater than 0.5 GeV/c to reject two-photon events, which typically have low transverse momentum tracks. To reject beamrelated background, we require the position of the reconstructed event vertex to be less than 3 cm from the interaction point along the beam direction, and separated by less than 0.5 cm in the transverse plane. The missing mass, M 2 miss = (p init \u2212 tr p tr \u2212 \u03b3 p \u03b3 ) 2 , and the polar angle of the missing momentum in the CM frame are efficient variables for rejecting two-photon and Bhabha backgrounds. In the definition of the missing mass, p tr and p \u03b3 are the four-momenta of measured tracks and photons, respectively, and p init is the initial CM frame four-momentum of the e + e \u2212 beams. We require that the missing mass be larger than 1 GeV/c 2 and less than 7 GeV/c 2 , and that the polar angle with respect to the beam direction in the CM frame be larger than 30 \u2022 and less than 150 \u2022 .

The azimuthal angle between the momentum vector and the decay vertex vector of the reconstructed K 0 S is required to be less than 0.1 rad. The distance between the two daughter pion tracks at their point of closest approach is required to be less than 1.8 cm, and the flight length of the K 0 S in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction is required to be larger than 0.08 cm. Finally, we require the invariant mass of each K 0 S candidate to be inconsistent with that of a \u039b,\u039b, and a photon conversion, where the daughter tracks are assumed to be pions and protons (antiprotons) or electrons and positrons as appropriate. Candidate \u03c0 0 's are reconstructed from pairs of photon clusters. The energy of each photon is required to exceed 50 MeV for candidates in the barrel part of the calorimeter, and 100 MeV for candidates in the endcap part of the calorimeter.

Events containing one or more reconstructed K 0 S or \u03c0 0 are rejected.

            "text": "In order to take into account the effects of the mass spectra on the branching fraction measurements, we have determined the mass spectra of the four dominant decay modes iteratively. The uncertainties in branching fractions due to the mass spectra are evaluated by varying the unfolded spectra by one standard deviation of their statistical and systematic errors, assuming 100% bin-by-bin correlations for systematic errors. The trigger efficiency for the three-prong modes is \u223c86% with an uncertainty of \u223c0.6%. This efficiency is obtained using a trigger simulation program applied to the signal MC samples. The uncertainty due to the \u03b3 veto is evaluated by using different selection criteria for photon energy. The uncertainty due to the K 0 S veto is evaluated by removing the veto requirement. The uncertainties in background estimation include the effect of luminosity, the cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , and the subtraction of background from non-three-prong \u03c4 decays and continuum e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq. The uncertainty on the \u03c4 decay background subtraction is evaluated by propagating the errors from the \u03c4 branching fractions other than those with three-prongs. The fraction of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq background is negligible for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 modes, and is 2.0 \u00b1 0.2% and 2.9 \u00b1 0.3% for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + K \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 modes, respectively.

The effects of the uncertainties in the luminosity and the cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 [24] are negligible because we use { e, \u00b5 } events for normalization.

The following sources of systematic uncertainties in the mass spectra are considered: the unfolding procedure (UNF1 and UNF2), the kaon identification efficiency (KID), the background estimation other than the three-prong cross-feed (BGE), the effect of \u03b3 veto (GAM), and the track momentum scale (MOM).Table III summarizes variouscontributions to the systematic uncertainties on the normalized mass spectra 1/N(dN/dM) for each decay mode.The systematic uncertainty due to the unfolding procedure is determined from MC by comparing the generated and unfolded mass spectra (UNF1). Another estimation of the uncertainty of the unfolding procedure is obtained by changing the value of unfolding parameter that determines the effective rank of the response matrix (UNF2). This is the most important systematic uncertainty for KKK mode. The kaon identification efficiency and the fake rate are calibrated by using D * + sample as described in the previous section. The uncertainties due to the particle identification (KID) are evaluated by varying efficiency and cross-feed fraction by one standard deviation in the response matrix. The systematic uncertainty from the background estimation (BGE) is evaluated by varying the branching fraction values used in the MC by one standard deviation. The uncertainty due to the \u03b3 veto (GAM) is evaluated by using different selection criteria for photon energy and comparing the resultant unfolded spectra. For the uncertainty from the track momentum scale (MOM), we reconstruct \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D \u00b1 \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 decays. By comparing the reconstructed masses of \u03c6 and D \u00b1 mesons with their world average values, we conservatively assign 0.01% uncertainty for the momentum scale. By applying this variation to the reconstructed mass spectra of \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 h + h \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay and unfolding it, we obtain the uncertainties due to the momentum scale.The systematic uncertainty varies as a function of the mass of the hadronic system in each mode. The typical uncertainties averaged over all mass bins are evaluated by summing the systematic uncertainties of each bin and ignoring the correlations between bins, and the results are 0.7%, 2.2%, 2.2%, and 9.5%, for the \u03c4 \u2212",
