These models explain the parity violation observed in weak interactions as the consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at a multi-TeV mass scale. This paper describes a search for such a heavy partner, a heavy right-handed gauge boson W R , in events with two same-flavor leptons (e or \u00b5) and two jets. The study was conducted by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC, using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 recorded during the 2016 data taking period.",

We also assume that the right-handed quark mixing matrix is the same as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. In addition to the gauge bosons, LR models usually include heavy right-handed neutrinos (N R ) [5,6].

The lepton flavor is conserved, and there is no charge requirement on the leptons, which can be opposite-sign or same-sign. The SM processes that have the same final state of two same-flavor leptons and two jets include Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs with additional jets (DY+jets), tt production, tW from t-channel single top quark production, and diboson production (WZ, ZZ, WW) with jets. Contributions due to events with jets misidentified as leptons are considered, but are found to be negligible. The discriminating variable in this search is the invariant mass m jj constructed from the two leptons and two jets with the largest transverse momenta. We search for an excess of events above the SM prediction for different W R mass hypotheses in windows of m jj . A search for W R bosons that was performed by the CMS Collaboration at a centerof-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV excluded W R masses up to approximately 3 TeV at 95% confidence level (CL) [10]. An excess with a local significance of 2.8\u03c3 was observed in that search in the electron channel at m eejj \u2248 2.1 TeV. The excess did not appear to be consistent with signal events from the LR symmetric theory. The search presented in this paper extends this previous search using data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV during 2016. It does not overlap with other heavy neutrino searches previously carried out by the CMS Collaboration [11][12][13]. The ATLAS Collaboration has also carried out similar searches [14][15][16].",

The experimental mass resolution for barrel-barrel (barrel-endcap) dielectron pairs with a mass of 1 TeV is 1.0 (1.5)% [20]. To correct for observed discrepancies in energy scale and resolution between data and simulation, the measured electron energy is adjusted by a multiplicative factor that depends on \u03b7 and R 9 , where R 9 is the ratio of the energy in a 3\u00d73 matrix of ECAL crystals, centered on the crystal with the largest energy, to the full energy collected by a supercluster. In addition, the electron energy in simulated events is smeared by 1-3% using a Gaussian expression that varies as a function of \u03b7 and R 9 [20]. Differences in electron identification (ID) efficiency between data and simulation were taken into account by applying a scale factor (SF) of 0.972 \u00b1 0.006 (stat+syst) in the barrel and 0.983 \u00b1 0.007 (stat+syst) in the endcaps.",

The muon curvature distributions in data and simulation are compared for different ranges of \u03b7 and azimuthal angle (\u03c6, in radians), resulting in the assignment of a momentum scale uncertainty of 3% in the barrel and up to 9% in the endcaps. To account for differences in the reconstruction and identification efficiencies between data and simulation, \u03b7-dependent SFs in the range 0.95-0.99 are applied to simulated events [21].

Charged hadrons that originate from pileup interactions are removed from the list of reconstructed particles using the charged-hadron pileup subtraction algorithm [19]. The contributions of neutral particles that originate from pileup interactions to the calorimeter energies are removed by applying a residual average area-based correction [24]. The jet momentum is defined as the vector sum of all particle momenta associated with the jet, and is found to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum in simulated events over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Jet energy corrections are derived from the simulation, and are confirmed with in-situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, photon+jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [25]. Jet identification algorithms [25] also remove contributions to jets from calorimeter noise and beam halo.",

This distribution extends over a range of several TeV. While the LR symmetric models motivate the choice of the jj final state, we do not impose requirements on the signal shape specific to these models, in order to maintain sensitivity to other models. The strategy to search for an excess of events in a wide mass range is effective in analyzing the data without exploiting other characteristics of the benchmark signal model and reduces the effect of the uncertainties in the shapes of the backgrounds, especially in the high-m jj region. The expected number of signal and background events is estimated by counting the events falling in a particular m jj window. The upper and lower limits of the mass window are chosen as a function of m W R to obtain the most stringent expected cross section upper limits. Optimizing with respect to signal significance instead results in comparable mass windows. The width of the mass window for the electron final state varies from 130 GeV at low masses (m W R 800 GeV) to 3100 GeV at high JHEP05 (2018)148masses (m W R 6000 GeV). For muons, the mass window varies more, and becomes as large as 3800 GeV. The upper and lower bounds are fitted as functions of m W R to third degree polynomials to reduce the effect of statistical fluctuations in the optimization procedure.",

The expected and observed exclusions are shown as the dotted (blue) curve and the solid (red) curve, respectively. The thindotted (blue) curves indicate the region in (m WR , m NR ) parameter space that is expected to be excluded at 68% CL in the case that no signal is present in the data. range of right-handed neutrino masses is excluded at 95% confidence level. A W R boson decaying into a right-handed heavy neutrino with a mass m N R = 1/2m W R is excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 4.4 TeV, providing the most stringent limit to date.",
