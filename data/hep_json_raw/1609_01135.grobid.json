            "text": "Quarkonium has been identified as a sensitive probe of deconfinement in a seminal contribution by Matsui and Satz [1] to heavy-ion physics in 1986. In the last thirty years, the field has progressed significantly on the theoretical and the experimental side. Quarkonium observables are certainly one of the drivers of the heavyion physics programme at the LHC and a key sector to be studied in the future with higher precision thanks to larger available statistics and better resolution by all four large experiments. The experimental results at the LHC from Run 1, i.e., the data takings in the years 2010-2013, contributed significantly to the most recent progresses in the field. First, the LHC highlights and the still open questions are summarised in order to provide the context for future opportunities. A detailed review of the first data taking campaign until the beginning of 2013 and the theoretical context beyond the scope of this article can be found in Ref. [2].",

            "text": "In the charmonium sector, ALICE presented a clear sign of a low transverse momentum (p T ) J/\u03c8 production component leading to a larger nuclear modification factor R AA [7,8,9,10,12], i.e., a weaker suppression compared to the results at RHIC by PHENIX [13] and STAR [14,15] for the p T integrated results and at low p T . This increase has been widely interpreted as a signature of late-stage J/\u03c8 production either during the life-time of the deconfined medium produced in heavy-ion collisions proposed in Ref. [16] or at the phase boundary between hadronic and Quark-Gluon Plasma matter [17]. This production mechanism is seen as a  1 . In addition, ATLAS [20], CMS [21,22,23] and ALICE measured at larger p T stronger suppressions than ALICE at low p T . The experimentally more challenging \u03c8(2S) plays a crucial role to establish the physics picture of the different models and providing also discriminative power between them, see for instance in [24]. First measurements of the excited \u03c8(2S) have been published currently strongly limited by statistics [25,10,11] awaiting a coherent phenomenological interpretation. The degree of thermalisation of the quarkonium states in A-A collisions can be also probed by measuring their azimuthal correlation in momentum space with respect to the bulk of soft particles emitted in the collision. This azimuthal distribution can be described by a Fourier decomposition. Most prominently, a positive second Fourier coefficient v 2 is expected in case of (partial) thermalisation at intermediate and low transverse momentum in semi-central collisions. A hint of azimuthal anisotropy of inclusive J/\u03c8 has been observed by ALICE with Run 1 data [26] at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4.0). CMS could detect a finite v 2 for prompt J/\u03c8 at midrapidity (|y| < 2.4) for p T > 6.5 GeV/c and down to p T > 3 GeV/c for 1.6 < |y| < 2.4 [23]. In summary, the measurements point to a certain degree of thermalisation at low and intermediate p T 5 GeV/c, but they are at the moment not able to disentangle between models considering production and destruction of charmonia during the medium lifetime or the statistical hadronisation model assuming the production at the phase boundary with thermal weights. The imprecise knowledge of the initial charm quark abundance is in this context the largest uncertainty independent of the model class. Finally, an additional J/\u03c8 production component has been detected at very low transverse momentum, p T 0.3 GeV/c, presumably from photon-induced origin in analogy to the production in ultra-peripheral collisions [27].",

            "text": "Alternatively, it was proposed that the main mechanism for the modification of charmonium and bottomonium could be coherent energy loss due to small angle gluon radiation of the colour dipole traversing the nucleus [42]. This model could also reproduce the main features of the available data for J/\u03c8 [34,32,35] and \u03d2 (1S) [36,37] production at low p T , where the strongest modifications are observed both in data as well as in the model. In summary, a variety of models exists and there is at the moment no conclusive and broadly accepted interpretation of the available data. Therefore, it appears not advisable to use the p-A data on quarkonium to constrain the nPDF's. It is also not possible to conclude that the coherent energy loss is the main effect or to claim that CGC calculations provide the best description of the data. Extrapolations to the expected nondeconfined nuclear modifications in A-A collisions based on p-A data can only be done under assumptions correct within certain frameworks. Nevertheless, first data driven attempts were pursued [35], which prove the power of the precise measurements in p-A collisions to constrain the expectations in A-A collisions if the underlying assumptions are valid.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the \u03c8(2S) is stronger suppressed than the J/\u03c8 in p-A collisions at the LHC [43,44]. This behaviour lacks an explanation within the nuclear parton distribution framework and the coherent energy loss model. The comover model which incorporates a late-stage interaction of the cc pair leading to the suppression of the excited state could as a first model account for the experimental observation [45]. The measured behaviour of \u03c8(2S) production in A-A collisions [25,10] was also interpreted as a sign of latestage interactions like in p-A collisions within an in-spirit similar approach than the comovers and a later freeze-out of the \u03c8(2S) [46]. This interpretation will need to be reassessed with the Run 2 data, which starts to become available [25]. In addition, a decrease of the yield ratio between the excited \u03d2 states normalised to the ground state as a function of midrapidity multiplicity has been observed in p-A and in pp [47] data. This observation might be related to the same physics as the \u03c8(2S) suppression. In addition to measurements as a function of multiplicity in pp [48,47] as well as in p-Pb [47,49], centrality-differential measurements in p-A collisions aiming at the distillation of the purely geometrically induced effects have been put forward in two publications by the ALICE Collaboration [50,51] and in preliminary results by ATLAS [52] using different approaches. The ALICE measurement shows a centrality dependence of the stronger suppression of \u03c8(2S). The J/\u03c8 modification itself is roughly compatible with the mechanisms also describing the data as a function of rapidity and p T . A centrality dependence of the \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 ratio is also visible in the ATLAS result at p T > 10 GeV/c. A quantitative comparison of data and theory as a function of centrality in p-A collisions and a clear interpretation of the results will however require a further understanding of the centrality definition with its large intrinsic resolution and systematic uncertainties and its mapping in theoretical calculations in p-A collisions.",

After a general introduction about the quarkonium capabilities of the 4 large LHC experiments, explanations about the expected improvements by instrumental upgrades and the increase in statistical reach are given.

This request is the baseline scenario, which is also the goal for the improvements of the accelerator performance thanks to upgrades to be installed during the second long shut-down in 2019/2020. The 2015 accelerator performance exceeded the design luminosity and reached already 35% of the upgrade goal [53]. We assume in the following that the same or larger luminosities will be delivered to ATLAS and CMS compared to ALICE, since both detectors are able to cope with rates exceeding the maximum interaction rate considered for ALICE. The mid-term schedule of the LHC programme up to the start of Run 3 including these upgrades is summarised in Fig. 2. A comparison of the luminosities obtained in Pb-Pb in 2015 and the anticipated numbers for a one year performance during Run 3 is shown in Table 1. Since LHCb only joined recently the A-A programme, it is not possible to be quantitative about the certainly strong potential of LHCb in heavy-ion collisions for quarkonium studies and the delivered luminosities.    4 Access to quarkonium at the LHC in heavy-ion collisions Quarkonium 3 production measurements in hadronic collisions usually rely on the sizeable partial decay width of the vector states (\u03c8) to dileptons. In addition, p-wave states are accessible by measurements of the type \u03c8 + \u03b3, where the \u03b3 is rather soft. The clear distinction of the different states typically requires the reconstruction of the photon as a conversion 4 . The p-wave states also contribute significantly to the inclusive production of the J/\u03c8, the \u03d2 (1S) and the \u03d2 (2S) by feed-down. Hence, their behaviour is crucial for the interpretation of the vector state measurements. In the upcoming data periods, all four experiments will take data in p-A as well as in A-A collisions. In Fig. 3, the acceptance of the different detectors for the measurement of J/\u03c8 is shown as a function of p T and rapidity based on measurements in A-A or expected performance based on already available information and in the pp collision system as comparison in collider mode. For the \u03d2 family, all experiments have acceptance down to zero p T of the dilepton pair within the same rapidity ranges. However, the resolution, the trigger and read-out capabilities of the detectors set practical limits. In the following, we will discuss the potential of the different set-ups separately.",

A large fraction of the delivered luminosity is available as recorded dimuon trigger sample. Therefore, it was already able to largely profit from the delivered luminosity by the LHC in Run 1. The complete spectrometer is placed behind a hadron absorber during Run 1 and In 2019, in the second long shut-down, an upgrade is planned to supplement the spectrometer with silicon detector planes in front of the absorber [56].

These measurements are based on minimum bias or centrality triggers and are challenging due to the small signal-over-background ratios. The main limitation of the set-up is the read-out rate limitation of about 200 Hz, when triggering primarily on the 0-10% most central Pb-Pb events in 2011 [57], and about 1 kHz in p-Pb during Run 1 for low pile-up within the drift time of the TPC of about 90 \u00b5s. Due to this read-out rate limitation, the analyses are statistically limited and, e. g., the \u03c8(2S) could not be detected during Run 1. In the winter break between 2015 and 2016, the TPC read-out was upgraded in order to reach a 2 times faster read-out in Pb-Pb collisions [58]. In p-Pb collisions, a read-out rate of about 1.6 kHz during the 2016 data taking period was achieved.",

For the bottomonium system, this restriction allows to reach zero p T for the dilepton pair with large acceptance factors. For the charmonium, the acceptance limit implies a p T cut-off of about 7-10 GeV/c for the dimuon p T in the measurements at midrapidity. At the forward rapidity edge of the muon systems, the acceptance of the dimuon trigger reaches lower in p T as demonstrated, e.g., in [25] also in Pb-Pb collisions. The performance of the muon offline reconstruction even in most central Pb-Pb collisions allows for not strongly mitigated background conditions and similar resolutions as in pp collisions for tight track selections in case of CMS. An example showing the performance for the \u03d2 family measured by CMS in pp and Pb-Pb collisions during Run 1 is given in Fig. 6.  mentioned in the introduction. The exact increase of the available statistics will depend on the trigger menu set-ups. In Run 4, with the upgraded High Level Triggers (HLT's), the detectors will be able to cope with an input rate of 750 kHz from the L1 triggers for CMS [62] and about 200 kHz for ATLAS [63] in pp collisions. These upgrades will open the possibility to process a larger fraction the Pb-Pb interaction rate and a larger fraction of the event reconstruction in the HLT. A physics reach study for the projected 10 nb \u22121 was performed by CMS [64]. The number of produced \u03d2 (3S) in this data sample is comparable to the number of \u03d2 (1S) particles presently available from Run 1. 5500 raw prompt J/\u03c8 above p T > 30 GeV/c integrated over centrality are estimated. The measurement of the nuclear modification factor of the \u03d2 family will be possible in steps of 10 % centrality percentiles up to the most peripheral class in order to match smoothly the measurements in p-A and pp collisions. This measurement will allow to map out potential differences or similarities at the same track multiplicity in the different systems. Future measurements will certainly also profit from improved resolutions of the upgraded detectors as demonstrated for the B s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 projections for CMS [65]. As already demonstrated with a first statistically limited study with 2011 data with prompt J/\u03c8 [23], various azimuthal anisotropy measurements will become feasible already with the new data collected in 2015. CMS and ATLAS proved for the J/\u03c8 to have acceptance coverage down to p T = 0 (CMS) or 1 (AT-LAS) GeV/c in pp collisions at a rapidity around y = 2 [66,67]. In addition, the CMS collaboration demonstrated the power of their recorded number of minimum bias events in Pb-Pb collisions with D-mesons in the 2011 and 2015 data taking [68,69] amounting to about 150 million events in 2015. Certainly, minimum bias samples collected by the multi-purpose detectors could potentially allow measurements of charmonium extending to lower p T than presently available data based on muons fully reconstructed in the muon systems. The exact reach will depend on the size of the achievable signal over background ratio and the trigger menu.",

The detector is fast, features a HLT with an input rate of 1 MHz in pp collisions and a large event rate storage capability of about 10 kHz. In Pb-Pb collisions, the lower tracker granularity does not allow to measure most central collisions. Currently, the tracking optimised for pp collisions allows to measure up to 50% in centrality. A first idea of the performance in Run 2 based on the about 50 minimum bias collisions collected in 2015 can be deduced from the J/\u03c8 peaks shown in Fig. 8. Measurements of \u03c7 c states should be feasible in peripheral collisions based on the experience in pp collisions [72,73]. LHCb allows within the event classes accessible to measure the full zoo of open heavy-flavour hadrons down to low p T thanks to the boost along the beam axis. The open charm species accesible to LHCb include the \u039b c . It was measured down to p T = 2 GeV/c in pp collisions [70]. This measurement represents the only published charm baryon cross section at the LHC to date. The silicon vertex locator as well as the other tracker components will be completely replaced in the long shut-down of 2019-2020. The granularity of the detector will be strongly increased, since the detector upgrade set-up is foreseen to operate the detector at larger pile-up in pp collisions: instead of one visible collision on average per bunch crossing, the design is planned to cope with 5.2 visible interactions to reach operations at an instantaneous luminosity of 2 \u2022 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 [74] in pp collisions. Furthermore, all bunch crossings will be processed by the HLT of LHCb. This upgrade will be hence very beneficial for the centrality reach of the detector in Pb-Pb collisions. Detailed simulation studies and tracking optimisations need to be performed to estimate the reach in centrality.",

In this regime, heavy-quark observables are unique as the most direct access to quarks as colour-charge carriers implanted early on into the system without being destroyed or generated during the evolution. This p T regime is at the same time the most challenging, but also a very interesting one for perturbative QCD calculations compared to pp and p-Pb data due to the probed low Bjorken-x and the comparatively small size of the hard scale in the hard matrix element of a few GeV. In this context, the presence of a deconfined medium is not expected to modify strongly the production of the heavy-quark states themselves, but only their density distribution in rapidity, p T or relative to the rest of particle production or in species distribution, i.e., the abundance of open, hidden heavy flavour mesons or baryons. The total cc and bb production rate is hence assumed to be independent of deconfinement effects. Measurements in p-A collisions are due to this reason the testing ground of all non-deconfinement effects present in A-A collisions. However, depending on the dominating physical effects, also the production modification of total heavy-quark production itself and even more the production of more specific heavy quark observables might not factorise going from p-A to A-A easily.",

Nevertheless, a clear falsification or a confirmation of the expectation can provide large progress. A few ideas are listed in this context: 1. Drell-Yan production between the \u03c8(2S) and the \u03d2 (1S) and the J/\u03c8: this measurement was proposed in [78] for p-A collisions. With the requested luminosity by LHCb in the 2016 running, this observable should be in reach in p-A collisions [79]. Certainly, there are experimental uncertainty cancellations. The cancellation of scale variation uncertainties on the theory side was however controversial at this workshop.

It has been also proposed in the context of late stage J/\u03c8 production models, e.g. in Ref. [80]. Experimentally, the measurement of \u039b c , which contributes to about 10% of the total cc cross section in pp collisions, is certainly the main challenge and experimental uncertainty cancellations are limited. The measurement of \u039b c down to low p T is one of the key measurements of the ALICE upgrade. 3. J/\u03c8 over D-meson production as a function of centrality in A-A and compared to p-A and pp: this measurement with the p T integrated quantities is certainly feasible with LHCb in peripheral collisions with the presently available data and might be also feasible with the present data by ALICE with extrapolation down to zero p T at midrapidity. The upgrade of ALICE should allow to access the observable at midrapidity in A-A. There is certainly room for the cancellation of uncertainties in this ratio from an experimental point of view. Theoretically, the full exploitation of this ratio will require assumptions on the hadronisation of charm quarks. 4. \u03d2 production over non-prompt J/\u03c8 as a function of centrality in A-A and compared to p-A and pp: it should allow to cancel uncertainties in the dimuon trigger systems of CMS, ATLAS or LHCb and on muon tracking in general.

In addition, tests of perturbative QCD will be available in nuclear collisions in particular at low Bjorken-x. The full exploitation of the data will require good communication with the phenomenology and theory side in order to put the results in the context of other measurements and to benefit from uncertainty cancellations. The establishment of a standard picture of quarkonia and heavy quark production and medium interaction in heavy-ion collisions at very high collision energies will be a difficult but rewarding task in the quest for the quark-gluon plasma.",
