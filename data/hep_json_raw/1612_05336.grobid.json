The search targets T quarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in fully hadronic final states. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV the daughter top quark and Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and can each appear as a single hadronic jet. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds. An excess of events is searched for in the T quark candidate mass distribution in the data, which is found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the single T quark production cross sections and the branching fraction B(T \u2192 tH), and these vary between 0.31 and 0.93 pb for T quark masses in the range 1000-1800 GeV. This is the first search for single electroweak production of a vector-like T quark in fully hadronic final states.",

The T quark appears in many extensions of the standard model (SM) and usually mixes with the SM top quark [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Vector-like quarks (VLQs) like the T could have a role in regularizing the SM Higgs boson (H) mass, thus offering a solution to the hierarchy problem [7,8]. The production of VLQs can be in pairs via the strong interaction, or singly in association with the SM top or bottom quarks via the electroweak interaction. The electroweak couplings of the T quarks to the SM third-generation quarks are highly model dependent. These couplings determine the rates of the single T quark production modes, shown in figure 1. The expected decay channels of a T quark coupling to the SM top or bottom quarks are T \u2192 bW, T \u2192 tZ, and T \u2192 tH [9]. Probing such processes could shed light on the mixing of VLQs with the SM third-generation quarks.",

A search for single production of T quarks decaying to Wb was conducted JHEP04(2017)136 by the ATLAS collaboration using pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, and a limit on the T quark mass was set at 950 GeV [13]. For high VLQ masses, the pair-production cross section rapidly decreases as the phase space for producing two massive particles is limited. Above the TeV range, single production via the electroweak process is expected to dominate over pair production [14], and is thus the focus of this search.",

Recently, a companion CMS analysis has searched for a singly-produced T quark with T \u2192 tH using this 13 TeV data set in a leptonic final state [17], and set limits on the product of the T quark cross section and the branching fraction B(T \u2192 tH) in the mass range 1000-1800 GeV.",

These partons subsequently hadronize to produce jets. For T quarks with a mass above 1 TeV, the decay products of the top quark and the Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and collimated, producing two hadronic jets. The accompanying jets are softer. Thus, the signature of a massive T quark would be the presence of highly boosted jets with masses corresponding to those of the top quark and the Higgs boson, and an overall large hadronic activity in the event. The T quark candidates are reconstructed using the top quark and Higgs boson jets. In the T quark candidate mass distribution, a localized excess of events above the SM background is expected in the presence of a signal. This is the first search for single electroweak production of a vector-like T quark in fully hadronic final states. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are employed to identify the highly Lorentz-boosted top quark and Higgs boson arising from the decay of a TeV scale resonance. The search in these final states exploits the ability of jet substructure techniques to reconstruct hadronically decaying SM particles in a challenging fully hadronic environment.",

The limits are listed in table 4. The cross section limits are derived with a signal sample simulated using the narrow width of 10 GeV. Studies on samples generated using larger widths have established that the reconstructed M (T) distributions do not change significantly compared to the narrow width approximation for T quarks having a width of up to 10% of their masses. The signal selection efficiency is estimated to decrease by about 7% for a T quark with a width of 10%, which is well within the uncertainties of the measurement. Hence, the measured limits on the cross sections are valid within uncertainties for a T quark of width of up to 10%.",

The branching fractions for the singlet case are B(T \u2192 bW) : B(T \u2192 tZ) : B(T \u2192 tH) = 0.5 : 0.25 : 0.25, while for the doublet, B(T \u2192 bW) : B(T \u2192 tZ) : B(T \u2192 tH) = 0 : 0.5 : 0.5. In the SSM , only the LH coupling c bW L is allowed for the singlet scenario, while for the doublet case there is only the RH coupling c tZ R . The cross sections are calculated assuming c bW L = 0.5 and c tZ R = 0.5 for the singlet and doublet scenarios, respectively. The values of the coupling factors correspond to a relatively narrow width for the T quark over the mass range searched for. The SSM does not predict a RH singlet or a LH doublet, and thus theoretical curves are not shown for the upper right and the lower left plots of figure 4. However, it should be noted that such couplings may still be possible in a non-minimal model. Furthermore, the observed limits on the cross sections correspond to values of the coupling factors that are larger than those associated with narrow resonances in the SSM. For a resonance width of 10% of the mass, which is the largest value for which the quoted limits are valid, the expected couplings lie between 0.6-0.3 for a T quark of mass between 1000-1800 GeV.",

Boosted H and t tagging techniques are used to identify the Higgs boson and the top quark decays in the final state, and the invariant mass of the two gives the T quark candidate mass. The background is mostly due to the standard model tt+jets, with some contribution from multijet and W+jets processes. No significant excess of data above the background is observed in the T quark candidate mass distribution. The 95% confidence level upper limits on the product of the signal cross sections and the branching fraction B(T \u2192 tH) are set using Bayesian statistics. These vary between 0.31-0.93 pb for a T quark of mass ranging from 1000 to 1800 GeV, in the pp \u2192 Tbq and pp \u2192 Ttq production channels with left-handed and right-handed couplings to the standard model third-generation quarks. In the mass range considered for this analysis, the search sensitivity is essentially the same as that using leptonic final states [17]. The use of boosted techniques has led to an extension of the search region beyond those of previous analyses. This is the first time fully hadronic final states have been exploited in the search for single electroweak production of vector-like quarks at a hadron collider.",
