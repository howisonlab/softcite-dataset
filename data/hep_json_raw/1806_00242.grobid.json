The measured value in the H ZZ* channel is mHZ* = 124.79 \u00b1 0.37 GeV, while the measured value in the H yy channel is mY = 124.93 \u00b1 0.40 GeV.

The combined efficiency of the lepton triggers is about 98% for the H ZZ* 4T events (as suming mH = 125 GeV) passing the offline selection.

For the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) signal, the NNLOPS sample gen erated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [12] with mH = 123, 125, 126 GeV and the PDF4LHC NLO parton distribu tion function (PDF) set [13] was used.

The NLO ggF sim ulation was performed with Powheg-Box v2 [14] interfaced to Pythia 8 [15] for parton showering and hadronisation, and to Evt-Gen [16] for the simulation of b-hadron decays. The CT10NLO [17] PDF set was used for the hard process and the CTEQ6L1 [18] set for the parton shower. The non-perturbative effects were modelled using the AZNLO set of tuned parameters [19].",

These corrections to the simulated momentum resolution and momentum scale are parameterised as a power expansion in the muon pT, with each co efficient measured separately for the ID and MS, as a function of n and 0, from large data samples of J/0 pp and Z p+p decays. The scale corrections range from 0.1% to 0.5% for the pT of muons originating from J/0 p ' p and Z p ' p decays and account for inaccurate measurement of the energy lost in the traversed material, local magnetic field inaccuracies and geometri cal distortions. The corrections to the muon momentum resolution for muons from J/0 p+pand Z p+p-are at the percent level. After detector alignment, there are residual local misalign ments that bias the muon track sagitta, leaving the track x2 in variant [31,32], and introduce a small charge-dependent resolution degradation. The bias in the measured momentum of each muon is corrected by an iterative procedure derived from Z p+ pdecays and checked against the E/p ratio measured in Z e+edecays. The residual effect after correction is reduced to the per mille level at the scale of the Z boson mass. This correction im proves the resolution of the dimuon invariant mass in Z boson decays by 1% to 5%, depending on n and 0 of the muon. The sys tematic uncertainty associated with this correction is estimated for each muon using simulation and is found to be about 0.4 x 10-3 for the average momentum of muons from Z p ' p decays. For muons from Z p+pdecays, with momenta of about 45 GeV, the momentum scale is determined to a precision of 0.05% for muons with |nl < 2, and about 0.2% for muons with |nl > 2. Similarly, the resolution is known with a precision ranging from 1% to 2% for muons with |n| < 2 and around 10% for muons with lnl > 2 [33]. Both the momentum scale and momentum resolution uncertainties in the corrections to simulation are taken as fully cor related between the Run 1 and Run 2 measurements.",

The first and second calorimeter layers are in tercalibrated using the energy deposited by muons from Z p+p-decays, with a typical uncertainty of 0.7% to 1.5% (1.5% to 2.5%) as a function of n in the barrel (endcap) calorime ter, for |nl < 2.4. This uncertainty is added in quadrature to the uncertainty in the modelling of the muon ionisation in the simulation (1% to 1.5% depending on n). The energy scale of the presampler is estimated using electrons from Z boson decays, after correcting the simulation on the basis of the cor relations between the amount of detector material and the ratio of the energies deposited in the first and second layers of the calorimeter. The uncertainty in the presampler energy scale varies between 1.5% and 3% depending on n. \u2022 The cluster energy is corrected for energy loss in the inactive materials in front of the calorimeter, the fraction of energy de posited outside the area of the cluster in the n-0 plane, the amount of energy lost behind the electromagnetic calorimeter, and to account for the variation of the energy response as a function of the impact point in the calorimeter. The calibration coefficients used to apply these corrections are obtained from a detailed simulation of the detector response to electrons and photons, and are optimised with a boosted decision tree (BDT). The algorithm, described in Ref. [37], has been trained on sim ulated samples corresponding to the data-taking conditions of 2015 and 2016. The response is calibrated separately for elec tron candidates, converted photon candidates and unconverted photon candidates. In data, small corrections are applied for the 0-dependent energy loss in the gaps between the bar rel calorimeter modules (corrections up to 2%, in about 5% of the calorimeter acceptance) and for inhomogeneities due to sectors operated at non-nominal high voltage (corrections be tween 1% and 7%, in about 2% of the calorimeter acceptance). \u2022 The global calorimeter energy scale is determined in situ with a large sample of Z e+e-events selected in the 2015 and 2016 datasets. The energy response in data and simulation is equalised by applying n-dependent correction factors to match the invariant mass distributions of Z e+e-events. The un certainty in these energy scale correction factors ranges from 0.02% to 0.1% as a function of n, except for the barrel-endcap transition region (1.37 < ini < 1.52), where it reaches a few per mille. In this procedure, the simulated width of the recon structed Z boson mass distribution is matched to the width observed in data by adding in the simulation a contribution to the constant term c of the electron energy resolution, E = -\u00ae b \u00ae c. This constant term varies between 0.7% and 2% VE E for Ini < 2.4 with an uncertainty of 0.03%-0.3%, except for the barrel-endcap transition region, where the constant term is slightly higher (2.5%-2.9%) with an uncertainty reaching 0.6%.",

These sources include uncertainties in the method used to extract the energy scale correction factors, as well as uncertainties due to the extrap olation of the energy scale from Z e+e-events to photons, and also to electrons with energies different from those produced in Z e+e-decays. The latter arise from the uncertainties in the linearity of the response due to the relative calibration of the dif ferent gains used in the calorimeter readout, in the knowledge of the material in front of the calorimeter (inside and outside of the ID, referred to as ID and non-ID material in the following), in the intercalibration of the different calorimeter layers, in the mod elling of the lateral shower shapes and in the reconstruction of photon conversions. The total calibration uncertainty for photons with transverse energy (ET) around 60 GeV is 0.2%-0.3% in the bar rel and 0.45%-0.8% in the endcap. These uncertainties are close to those quoted in Ref. [36], but typically about 10% larger. The small increase in the uncertainty arises mostly from a larger uncertainty in the relative calibration of the first and second calorimeter lay ers with muons because of a worse ratio of signal to pile-up noise in Run 2 data. In the case of electrons with ET around 40 GeV, the total uncertainty ranges between 0.03% and 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance.

The two approaches may lead to different results from the decomposition of the uncertainty for a combination of measurements with significant and uncorrelated systematic uncer tainties.  [11,44]. The lepton pair with an invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass in each quadruplet is referred to as the leading dilepton pair, while the remaining pair is referred to as the subleading dilep ton pair. The selected events are split according to the flavour of the leading and subleading pairs; ordered according to the ex pected selection efficiency, they are 4z, 2e2z, 2^2e, 4e. Recon structed photon candidates passing final-state radiation selections are searched for in all the events [45]. Such photons are found in 4% of the events and their energy is included in the mass com putation. In addition, a kinematic fit is performed to constrain the invariant mass of the leading lepton pair to the Z boson mass, improving the m4t resolution by about 15% [7]. The improvement brought by the correction of the local tracker misalignments, as discussed in Section 4, is at the percent level for the m4i resolu tion of signal events. After event selection, the m4i> resolution for the signal (at mH = 125 GeV), estimated with a Gaussian fit around the peak, is expected to be about 1.6, 1.8, 2.2 and 2.4 GeV for the 4z, 2e2z, 2^2e and 4e channels respectively. In the fit range of 110 < m4\u00a3 < 135 GeV, 123 candidate events are observed.

The lepton energy response distributions are derived from simulation as a function of the lepton energy and detector region. The lepton energy response is modelled as a weighted sum of three Gaus sian distributions. For an observed event, the m4i> pdf is derived from the convolution of the response distributions of the four measured leptons. The direct convolution of the four leptons dis tributions, leading to 34 = 81 Gaussian distributions, is simplified to a weighted sum of four Gaussian pdfs following an iterative merging procedure as performed with the Gaussian-sum filter pro cedure [46,47]. An additional correction is applied to remove the residual differences which arise from the correlation between the lepton energy measurements introduced by the kinematic con strained fit on the leading dilepton pair and the BDT categorisation of events. These are corrected by a fit of scaling modifiers of the reduced response parameters to the simulated four-lepton resolu tion.

A first categorisation is based on whether the photons are reconstructed as converted or not, a second is based on the photons' impact points in the calorimeter (either in the barrel region, |nl < 1.37, or in the endcap region, |nl > 1.52), and a third is based on the num ber of interactions per bunch crossing. For each of these categories a new background model, a new signal model and new systematic uncertainty values are computed. For each category the compati bility of its mH value with the combined mH value is tested by considering as an additional likelihood parameter the quantity Ai equal to the difference between that category's mH value and the combined value. No value of Ai significantly different from zero is found. A similar test is performed to assess the global compatibil ity of all the different categories with a common value of mH. In the three categorisations considered the smallest global p-value is 12%.
