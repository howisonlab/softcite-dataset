The analysis is based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, collected with the LHCb detector. An excess with 2.8 \u03c3 significance is seen for the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp and an upper limit on the branching fraction is set at the 90 % confidence level: B(B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp) < 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , which is the first such limit. No significant signals are seen for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp\u03c0 + decays, for which the corresponding limits are set: B(B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp) < 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , which significantly improves the existing limit; and B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp\u03c0 + ) < 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , which is the first limit on this branching fraction.",

            "text": "The production of baryon-antibaryon pairs in B meson decays is of significant experimental and theoretical interest. For example, in the case of pp pair production, the observed decays B 0 \u2192 D ( * )0 pp [1,2], B + \u2192 K ( * )+ pp [3][4][5][6][7], B 0 \u2192 K ( * )0 pp [4,6] and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + pp [4,5] all have an enhancement near the pp threshold. 1 Possible explanations for this behaviour include the existence of an intermediate state in the pp system [8] and short-range correlations between p and p in their fragmentation [9][10][11]. Moreover, for each of these decays, the branching fraction is approximately 10 % that of the corresponding decay with pp replaced by \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [12]. In contrast, the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp has not yet been observed; the most restrictive upper limit being B(B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp) < 8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90 % confidence level [13], approximately fifty times lower than the branching fraction for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [14]. This result is in tension with the theoretical prediction of B(B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp) = (1.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [15]. Improved experimental information on the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp decay would help to understand the process of dibaryon production.",

All branching fractions are measured relative to that of the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which is well suited for this purpose due to its similar topology to the signal decays.

The combined tracking system provides momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [18]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [19].

At the hardware stage either one or two identified muon candidates are required. In the case of single muon triggers, the transverse momentum of the candidate is required to be larger than 1.5 GeV/c. For dimuon candidates a requirement on the product of the p T of the muon candidates is applied, \u221a p T1 p T2 > 1.3 GeV/c. In the subsequent software trigger, at least one of the final state muons is required to have both p T > 1.0 GeV/c and IP > 100 \u00b5m. Finally, the muon tracks are required to form a vertex that is significantly displaced from the primary vertices (PVs) and to have invariant mass within 120 MeV/c 2 of the known J/\u03c8 mass, m J/\u03c8 [12]. The selection uses a multivariate algorithm (hereafter referred to as MVA) to reject background. A neural network is trained on data using the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 control channel as a proxy for the signal decays. Preselection criteria are applied in order to obtain a clean sample of the control channel decays. The muons from the J/\u03c8 decay must be well JHEP09(2013)006 identified and have p T > 500 MeV/c. They should also form a vertex with \u03c7 2 vtx < 12 and have invariant mass within the range \u221248 < m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 m J/\u03c8 < 43 MeV/c 2 . The separation of the J/\u03c8 vertex from all PVs must be greater than 3 mm. The pion candidates must be inconsistent with the muon hypothesis, have p T > 200 MeV/c and have minimum \u03c7 2",

The nominal signal shapes are replaced with a bifurcated Gaussian function with asymmetric exponential tails. The background is modelled with an exponential function for B 0 (s) \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp decays, whereas a second-order polynomial function is used for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp\u03c0 + and the normalisation channel. Combined in quadrature, these sources change the fitted yields by 2.5, 2.6 and 0.7 events, which correspond to 42 %, 12 % and 92 % for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp, B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 pp\u03c0 + modes, respectively.

It is assumed that f u = f d . The uncertainty on the measurement of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction includes a contribution from this source.
