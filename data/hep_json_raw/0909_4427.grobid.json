            "text": "The understanding of QCD jet events is the dominant background-determination challenge in Supersymmetry (SUSY) searches, in events containing jets and missing transverse energy (E miss T ). Effects such as jet punch through the calorimeters and cosmic ray backgrounds can affect the E miss T . Other effects like pile-up of cavern and beam halo backgrounds can dramatically increase the cross-section of high E miss T QCD backgrounds. Sources of systematic uncertainties in the estimation of QCD backgrounds include sensitivity to underlying event models and parton distribution functions. In the next sections we discuss important techniques for estimating the QCD backgrounds uncertainties in searches for SUSY, under development by the ATLAS [1] collaboration. We evaluate the effects in terms of the effective mass, here defined as M eff = \u2211 4 i=1 |p T ( j i )| + E miss T , for its important discriminative power for SUSY. All studies shown here are for 14 TeV center-of-mass energy, but the methods are also valid at lower energies.",

These effects are estimated in what follows. For each event, the energy and momentum of each jet has been scaled by a constant factor, corresponding to a 10%, 5%, 3% and 1% uncertainty on the JES. The E miss T has also been adjusted accordingly, by an amount corresponding to the change in the sum of the jet momenta in the x and y directions. improved understanding of the JES to a level of 5% reduces the uncertainty on M eff by more than a factor of two, while a 3% value shows an improved uncertainty on M eff of between \u223c 10-30%. If 1% uncertainty in JES is achievable, the uncertainty in M eff will be \u223c 5-10%.",

Such sliced-sample production is also possible in ALPGEN. The number of PYTHIA events passing the ATLAS SUSY jet selection cuts [2] is 2.1 times larger than the number of ALPGEN events for the same integrated luminosity. Both samples were normalized to 1 fb \u22121 and ALPGEN samples were further multiplied by a factor of 2.1. Error bars on each histogram are based on the Monte Carlo statistics used in this study. Figure 2 (left) shows the p T distribution of the leading jet for ALPGEN and PYTHIA events. In PYTHIA, for example the 2 \u2192 2 scattering processes give softer leading p T jets because of the emmission of additional partons from the leading ones. The M eff distribution between generators are shown in Figure 2, right. The M eff distribution of ALPGEN events is harder than that of PYTHIA events, as expected from Figure 2, left.",

The understanding of the ATLAS detector and the underlying physics of QCD processes at high energy, will re- quire a sufficient amount of data. For this reason data-driven background estimates with minimal reliance on Monte Carlo simulation will be a priority for the early phase of data-taking. The data driven approach in ATLAS relies on smearing the jet transverse momenta in regions of low E miss T using a data-measured response function. This response function is defined as the distribution of event-by-event ratios of measured jet p T to true jet p T . The method to measure the calorimeter response to jets from data is divided in three steps: Gaussian response function measurement, full response function measurement including non-Gaussian tails and finally jet p T smearing.",

Smeared events are constructed from each selected seed event by smearing the transverse momenta of their constituent jets with the full jet response function determined in the second step.
