            "text": "A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the mass range from 0.2 to 3.0 TeV, decaying to a pair of W bosons, is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The W boson pair decays are reconstructed in the 2 2\u03bd and \u03bd2q final states (with = e or \u00b5). Both gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production of the signal are considered. Interference effects between the signal and background are also taken into account. The observed data are consistent with the standard model (SM) expectation. Combined upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction exclude a heavy Higgs boson with SM-like couplings and decays up to 1870 GeV. Exclusion limits are also set in the context of a number of two-Higgs-doublet model formulations, further reducing the allowed parameter space for SM extensions.",

            "text": "The discovery of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, with a mass close to 125 GeV, by the CERN LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS in 2012 [1][2][3] represents a major advancement in particle physics. Studies of the new particle have so far shown consistency with the SM Higgs mechanism predictions [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Throughout this paper, the observed SM Higgs boson is denoted as h(125). In order to determine whether the SM gives a complete description of the Higgs sector, precise measurements of the h(125) coupling strengths, JHEP03(2020)034 CP structure and kinematic distributions are required [16][17][18][19][20]. A complementary strategy involves the search for an additional Higgs boson, denoted X, whose existence would prove the presence of beyond the SM (BSM) physics in the form of a non minimal Higgs sector [21,22]. The search for an additional scalar resonance in the full mass range accessible at the LHC remains one of the main objectives of the experimental community.",

For the semileptonic channel, the leptonically decaying boson is reconstructed as a single isolated lepton and p miss T .

Jet substructure techniques are used to identify merged jets with two well defined subjets and to determine the merged jet mass, helping to discriminate vector boson hadronic decays from other jets. When the W boson hadronic decay products are resolved, it may be reconstructed using two quark jets (a dijet). The search is performed in a wide mass range from 0.2 up to 3.0 TeV.

The trigger efficiency for \u03bd2q signal events passing the offline event selection is about 93%. Both single-lepton and dilepton triggers are used to select events to study the 2 2\u03bd final state. In addition to the singlelepton triggers described, the 2 2\u03bd final state events are also selected by a trigger which requires one electron outside the central region (2.1 < |\u03b7| < 2.5) with p T > 27 GeV. The dilepton triggers require the presence of two leptons passing relatively loose identification and isolation requirements. For the dielectron (dimuon) trigger, the p T thresholds are 23 (17) GeV for the leading and 12 (8) GeV for the subleading electrons (muons). For the different-flavour dilepton trigger, the p T thresholds are either 8 GeV for the muon and 23 GeV for the electron, or 23 GeV for the muon and 12 GeV for the electron. The overall trigger efficiency for the combination of the single-lepton and dilepton triggers for 2 2\u03bd signal events passing the offline event selection is larger than 99%.",

The cross sections of the different single top quark processes are calculated at NLO [48], while the tt cross section is computed at NNLO, with next-tonext-to-leading-logarithmic soft-gluon resummation [49]. The WW diboson continuum background is simulated in a number of ways. The production of WW via qq (qq \u2192 WW) is generated using powheg [50] and Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo at NLO, WW production via gluon fusion (gg \u2192 WW) is generated using mcfm v7.0 [51] at leading order (LO), while a WW plus two jets (qq \u2192 qqWW) sample is produced with MadGraph5 amc@nlo at LO. The cross section used for normalizing the WW processes produced via qq is computed at NNLO [52]. For the gg \u2192 WW process, the difference between LO and NLO cross sections is large; a scale factor of 1.4 is theoretically calculated [53] and applied to the cross section prediction from mcfm. In order to suppress the top quark background processes, the 2 2\u03bd analysis implements an event categorization based on jet multiplicity. This approach spoils the convergence of fixed-order calculations of the qq \u2192 WW process and requires the use of dedicated resummation techniques for an accurate prediction of the differential distributions [54,55]. The simulated qq \u2192 WW events are therefore reweighted to reproduce the p WW T distribution from the p T -resummed calculation.",

            "text": "A signal interpretation in terms of a heavy Higgs boson with SM-like couplings and decays is implemented in this analysis. Both the ggF and VBF production mechanisms are considered. Due to the large expected width of the X resonance at high-mass, its interference with the WW continuum and the h(125) off-shell tail becomes significant [29]. The MELA matrix-element package [18,40,41], based on JHUGen for Higgs bosons, and on mcfm for the continuum WW background, has been used to estimate the interference of high-mass X resonances with the WW continuum and the h(125). The two sources of interference have opposite signs and partially cancel out with the size of the cancellation depending on the signal mass. Figure 1 displays the generator-level mass distribution of a ggF-produced 700 GeV signal and the effects of interference with the gg \u2192 WW continuum and gg \u2192 h(125) off-shell tail. The interference effect is taken into account for both the ggF and VBF production mechanisms. A parameter f VBF , which is the fraction of the VBF production cross section with respect to the total cross section, is included in the model and a number of hypotheses investigated. An interpretation in the context of a general 2HDM is conducted. Various formulations of the 2HDM predict different couplings of the two doublets to right-handed quarks and charged leptons: in the Type-I formulation [22], all fermions couple to only one Higgs doublet; in the Type-II formulation [22], the up-type quarks couple to a different doublet than the down-type quarks and leptons. There are five physical Higgs bosons predicted: two CP-even neutral bosons h and H; a neutral CP-odd boson A; and two charged bosons H \u00b1 . In most formulations of the 2HDM, h corresponds to the h(125), and H is an additional high-mass CP-even Higgs boson. The 2HDM has two important free parameters, \u03b1 and JHEP03(2020)034 tan \u03b2, which are the mixing angle and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, respectively. The quantity cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) is also of interest, as the coupling of the heavy Higgs boson H to two vector bosons is proportional to this factor. In the alignment limit, which occurs at cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0, the properties of h approach those of the SM Higgs boson, while the decay of H to vector bosons becomes heavily suppressed. Based on the constraints given by the measurements of the h(125) couplings, the largest possible deviations of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) from 0 allowed are approximately 0.3 and 0.1 for the Type-I and -II scenarios respectively [76,77]. Therefore the value of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) has been fixed to 0.1 for the 2HDM scenarios considered here. In this way the measured properties of the h(125) are incorporated into the definition of the scenarios while still allowing for a non-negligible branching fraction for H to vector bosons. In the limit that m A m Z , the masses of the H, A, and H \u00b1 bosons become approximately degenerate. For simplicity it is assumed that m H = m A = m H \u00b1 for the 2HDM scenarios considered. The width of H has a dependence on tan \u03b2, with relatively large widths predicted in comparison to both the SM widths and the experimental resolution for tan \u03b2 below \u22480.2 and m H above \u2248400 GeV. However, for the majority of the phase space explored the SM width assumption gives a reasonable approximation of the 2HDM predictions.",

            "text": "The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [78,79], which incorporates a Type-II 2HDM, is also considered. At tree level, the whole phenomenology can be described using just two parameters. By convention, these parameters are chosen to be tan \u03b2 and m A , the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson. Beyond the tree level, the MSSM Higgs sector depends on additional parameters which enter via higher-order corrections in perturbation theory, and which are usually fixed to values motivated by experimental constraints and theoretical assumptions. The m mod+ h [80] and hMSSM [81][82][83][84] benchmark scenarios are defined by setting these parameters such that a wide range of the m A -tan \u03b2 parameter space is compatible with the h(125) mass and production rate measurements at ATLAS and CMS. For the M 125 h , M 125 h (alignment), M 125 h ( \u03c7), and M 125 h ( \u03c4 ) benchmark scenarios, a significant portion of the parameter space is consistent with the h(125) measurements and with limits from searches for supersymmetry particles and additional Higgs bosons at ATLAS and CMS using pp collisions at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV [85]. The assumption of a SM width is a reasonable approximation for the MSSM scenarios considered, with relatively small widths predicted with respect to the experimental resolution for the majority of the phase space explored.",

This is implemented with MELA which uses JHUGen and mcfm matrix elements to calculate probabilities for an event to come from either signal or background, respectively. A WW resonance candidate is considered ggF-tagged if the kinematic discriminant is greater than 0.5.

The majority of the events passing the \u03bd2q selection come from W+jets and top quark production. An estimate of the W+jets and top quark background normalizations using two control regions in data is employed. A top quark enriched data control region is defined reversing the b jet veto, by requiring events with an additional jet which is b-tagged. Additionally, a sideband control region, with a similar background composition to that of the signal region, is defined by adapting the hadronic W candidate mass requirements of the signal region selection. In the boosted (resolved) category m J (m jj ) is required to be outside the W boson mass window  and within the range 40 < m J (m jj ) < 250 GeV. In the final fit to the data, the normalizations of both the W+jets and top quark backgrounds are allowed to float freely, with the observed yields in the control regions used to constrain the normalizations. This background estimation procedure is applied independently in each category.",
