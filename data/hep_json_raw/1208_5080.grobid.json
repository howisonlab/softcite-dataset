Jets are reconstructed using anti \u2212 kT, kT and SISCone jet finding algorithms with resolution parameter R = 0.4 in the range of transverse momentum from 20 to 100 GeV/c in the midrapidity region (| \u03b7 | < 0.5). The uncorrected charged jet spectra obtained using the three different jet finders show good agreement. The data are compared to predictions from PYTHIA-Perugia0, PYTHIA-Perugia2011, and PHOJET. The mean charged particle multiplicity in leading jets increases with increasing jet pT and is consistent with model predictions. The radial distributions of transverse momentum about the jet direction and the distributions of the average radius containing 80% of the total jet pT found in the jet cone (R = 0.4 in this analysis), indicate that high pT jets are more collimated than low pT jets.",

            "text": "Jets are collimated sprays of particles originating from the fragmentation of hard scattered partons (quarks and gluons) produced in pp (or A-A) collisions [2]. As such, jets serve as a proxy for the high p T partons produced in elementary hard scatterings. In pp collisions, they provide a unique tool to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [3]. Measurements of jet shapes in particular, provide the details of the jet fragmentation process [2]. Jet shapes are also sensitive to the type of partons (quarks or gluons) that fragment into hadrons. In addition, measurements in pp collisions provide a baseline for similar measurements in more complex A-A collisions where various nuclear effects are expected to take place. Jet shape observables have previously been measured by the CDF [4,5,6] and D0 [7] collaborations in pp collisions and more recently by the ATLAS [8] and CMS [9] collaborations in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In this paper we report preliminary results of charged particle jet properties measured by A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV.",

The V-ZERO (V0) counters [15] and the ITS are used for online trigger to select the minimum bias events. Only events with primary vertex within \u00b110 cm along the beam axis from the nominal interaction point are analyzed to ensure uniform acceptance in pseudo-rapidity (\u03b7) and minimize the need for complex acceptance corrections. This analysis is based on 161 M minimum bias events. Tracks are reconstructed using combined information from the TPC and the ITS. These tracks have uniform high tracking efficiency for charged particles, good momentum resolution and uniform \u03c6 distribution. Tracks are included in the analysis if p T,track > 0.150 GeV/c and | \u03b7 track | < 0.9.",

These effects were estimated using MC (PYTHIA) events. Uncertainties on the measured observables are estimated by varying the efficiency and momentum resolution by 5% and 20% respectively. Figure 2 (Top panel) shows the uncorrected transverse momentum distributions of charged particle jets obtained using the anti \u2212 k T (filled black circles), k T (filled red triangles), and SISCone (open blue circles) jet finding algorithms with R = 0.4 within | \u03b7 | < 0.5, in the range of transverse momentum from 20 to 100 GeV/c for pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The ratios between the uncorrected yields obtained with the k T , and SISCone to that obtained with the anti-k T are shown in the bottom panel. We observe that the three different jet reconstruction algorithms agree well with each other at detector level.",

Figure 5 shows the radial distributions of transverse momentum in the leading jet about the jet axis for jet p T between 20 to 30 GeV/c (left panel) and 60 to 80 GeV/c (right panel). It can be clearly seen in the figure that the transverse momentum density is largest near the jet axis and decreases with r. The higher slop for this decrease in case of high p T jets (right panel) indicates that high p T jets are more collimated than low p T jets.   Figure 5.
