In order to reach these goals, a study of hadron production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei. In this talk, the newest preliminary results on kaon spectra produced in Ar+Sc collisions at three beam momenta (30A, 40A and 75A) will be shown. The distributions of transverse mass and rapidity will be compared with results of NA61/SHINE (p+p, Be+Be) and NA49 (Pb+Pb, C+C, Si+Si), as well as with available world data.",

The yields of hadrons produced in the collisions are studied for indications of the onset of deconfinement (kink, horn and step) and the critical point of the phase transition (hill in event-by-event fluctuations). This paper discusses the analysis of Ar+Sc collisions, the next step of the system size scan, following the earlier analysis of p+p and Be+Be reactions. Comparison of obtained kaon spectra gives important insight into the dynamics of ion collisions in the transition region between reactions of light and heavy nuclei.",
