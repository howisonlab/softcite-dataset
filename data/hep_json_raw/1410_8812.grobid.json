The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb \u22121 collected in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. No deviation from the standard model predictions is observed for these final states. New, improved limits are set on dark matter production and on parameters of models with large extra dimensions. In particular, the first limits from the LHC on branon production are found and significantly extend previous limits from LEP and the Tevatron. An upper limit of 14.0 fb on the cross section is set at the 95% confidence level for events with a monophoton final state with photon transverse momentum greater than 145 GeV and missing transverse momentum greater than 140 GeV.",

With a photon in the final state, we gain sensitivity to the production of invisible particles. The SM-DM interaction is assumed to be mediated by a virtual particle (\"mediator\") with a mass M much heavier than the fermionic DM particle mass (M \u03c7 ). Various processes are contracted into an effective field theory (EFT) [2][3][4][5], assuming M much larger than the momentum transfer scale Q (i.e. M Q ) and a contact interaction scale given by \u22122 = g \u03c7 g q M \u22122 , where g \u03c7 and g q are the mediator couplings to \u03c7 and to quarks, respectively. Using this formalism, results from searches at the LHC can be related to limits for direct searches sensitive to \u03c7 -nucleon scattering [5].",

In this alternative scheme, the brane tension scale f is expected to be much smaller than other relevant scales such as M D . The particles associated with such fluctuations are scalar particles called branons. Branons are stable and massive scalar particles of mass M B , and are natural candidates for dark matter [12]. They can be pair-produced in association with SM particles at the LHC, giving rise to \u03b3 + missing transverse momentum final states [13].

Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.479) and two endcap (1.479 < |\u03b7| < 3.0) sections. Electrons are found by associating clusters of ECAL energy with adjacent tracker hits. Muons are detected in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, using gasionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid, and reconstructed from tracks in these detectors combined with those from the silicon tracker. Extensive forward calorimetry (3.15 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The energy resolution for photons with transverse momentum \u226560 GeV varies between 1.1% and 2.6% over the solid angle of the ECAL barrel, and from 2.2% to 5.0% in the endcaps [14]. The timing measurement of the ECAL has a resolution better than 200 ps for energy deposits larger than 10 GeV [14]. In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5\u00d75 arrays of ECAL crystals to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outward from the nominal interaction point. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [15].",

The only nonnegligible residual contribution to the candidate sample is found to arise from the beam halo, with an estimated 25 \u00b1 6 events. Table 1 shows the estimated number of events and associated uncertainty from each background process along with the total number of events observed in the data, for the entire data set, which corresponds to 19.6 fb \u22121 . The number of events observed in data agrees with the expectation from SM background. The photon E T and / E T distributions for the selected candidates and estimated backgrounds are shown in Fig. 1. The spectra expected from the ADD model for M D = 2 TeV and n = 3 are also shown for comparison. Limits are set for the DM, ADD, and branon models using the E \u03b3 T spectrum.  The product of the acceptance and the efficiency ( A ) is estimated by calculating A MC from the simulation, and multiplying it by the F to account for the difference in efficiency between simu-  lation and data. The ADD, DM, and branon simulated samples are processed through the full Geant4-based simulation of the CMS detector [26,27], trigger emulation, and the same event reconstruction programs as used for data. For DM production, the simulated samples are produced using MadGraph 5v1.3.12 [39], and requiring E \u03b3 T > 130 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.5. The estimated value of A MC for M \u03c7 in the range 1-1000 GeV varies over the range 41.6-44.4% for vector and 41.4-44.1% for axial-vector couplings, respectively. The E \u03b3 T spectra for ADD simulated events are generated using pythia 8.153 [40], requiring E \u03b3 T > 130 GeV. The A MC for the ADD model varies over the range 33.4-37.4% in the parameter space spanned by n = 3-6 and M D = 1-3 TeV.

The systematic uncertainty in A MC from the modeling of pileup, the energy calibration, and the resolution for photons, jets, and / E T is \u00b12.1%. The systematic uncertainty from the scale factor is 6.4%, resulting in a total systematic uncertainty in A MC of 6.7%. The systematic uncertainty in the measured integrated luminosity is \u00b12.6% [41].

In general, the effective operator could be a mixture of vector and axial terms; for explicitness, the limiting cases of pure vector and pure axial vector operators have been chosen, corresponding to spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions, respectively. Following the procedures of Refs.

These studies show that the condition M Q may not always be satisfied because of the high momentum transfer scale at the LHC energies. Therefore, to interpret the data in a meaningful way where the EFT does not hold, following [3] we consider a simplified model predicting DM production via an s-channel vector mediator. For this simplified model, the simulated samples are produced using MadGraph 5v1.5.12 [39], and requiring E \u03b3 T > 130 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.5. Limits on the SM-DM interaction mediator mass divided by coupling, for this model, are shown in Fig. 4. The mass of the mediator is varied for two fixed values of the mass of the DM particle: 50 GeV and 500 GeV, and the width of the mediator is varied from M/8\u03c0 to M/3 [3]. The contours for fixed values of \u221a g \u03c7 g q are also shown for comparison. For M \u03c7 = 500 GeV the results for a mediator with a mass 5 TeV are similar to those obtained from the EFT approach as listed in Table 3, while the limits are weaker for M 100 GeV. The limits are stronger than those of the EFT approach in the range of M from \u223c100 GeV to \u223c4 TeV, because of the resonance production enhancement in the cross section. In other words, the limits derived within the EFT framework are conservative in this region. For illustration purposes, similar distributions for M \u03c7 = 50 GeV are also shown in Fig. 4.",

The limits on M D for several values of n, the number of extra dimensions, are summarized in Table 5. These limits, along with existing ADD limits from the Tevatron [58,59] and LEP [60-63], are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of M D . All these results are based on LO cross sections. Our results extend significantly the experimental limits on the ADD model in the single-photon channel [64,70], and set limits of M D > 2.12-1.97 TeV for n = 3-6, at 95% CL. These results are comparable with the recent ATLAS limits [57].",
