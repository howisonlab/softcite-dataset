The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.58\u00b10.02 nb \u22121 recorded at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s NN = 5 TeV. Measurements of the differential cross-section, the forward-backward production ratio and the nuclear modification factor are reported using D 0 candidates with transverse momenta less than 10 GeV/c and rapidities in the ranges 1.5 < y * < 4.0 and \u22125.0 < y * < \u22122.5 in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass system.",

            "text": "Charm hadrons produced in hadronic and nuclear collisions are excellent probes to study nuclear matter in extreme conditions. The differential cross-sections of c-quark production in pp or pp collisions have been calculated based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and collinear or k T factorisation [1][2][3][4][5][6]. These phenomenological models [7] are also able to predict the differential cross-section of c-quark production including most of the commonly assumed \"cold nuclear matter\" (CNM) effects in nuclear collisions, where CNM effects related to the parton flux differences and other effects come into play. Since heavy quarks are produced in hard scattering (with momentum transfer squared Q 2 2m c ) typically at a short time scale, they are ideal to examine hot nuclear matter, the so-called \"quark-gluon plasma\" (QGP), by studying how they traverse this medium and interact with it right after their formation.",

Phenomenologically, collinear parton distributions are often used to describe the nuclear modification of the parton flux in the nucleus. The modification with respect to the free nucleon depends on the parton fractional longitudinal momentum x, Q 2 and the atomic mass number of the nucleus A [13,14]. In the low-x region, down to x \u2248 10 \u22125 \u221210 \u22126 , which is accessible at LHC energies at forward rapidity, a possible onset of gluon saturation may occur [15][16][17][18][19]. Its effect can be quantified by studying production of D 0 mesons at low transverse momentum p T [20], ideally down to zero p T . The in-medium energy loss occurs when the partons lose energy in the cold medium through both initialand final-state radiation.",

The luminosity has been determined using the same method as in the LHCb measurement of J/\u03c8 production in pPb collisions [46], with a precision of about 2%. The instantaneous luminosity during the period of data taking was around 5\u00d710 27 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , which led to an event rate that was three orders of magnitude lower than in nominal LHCb pp operation. Therefore, the hardware trigger simply rejected empty events, while the next level software trigger accepted all events with at least one track in the VELO. For the analyses presented below, simulated samples of pp collisions at 8 TeV are used to determine geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies. Effects due to the different track multiplicity distributions in the pp and pPb collision data and the effects of the asymmetric beam energies in pPb collisions are taken into account as described later. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [47,48] with a specific LHCb configuration [49]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [50], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [51]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [52][53][54].",

The fraction of nonprompt D 0 mesons originating from b-hadron decays, called D 0 -from-b in the following, is determined from the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP (D 0 )) distribution, where \u03c7 2 IP (D 0 ) is defined as the difference in vertex-fit \u03c7 2 of a given PV computed with and without the D 0 meson candidate [56,57]. On average, -4 -  prompt D 0 mesons have much smaller \u03c7 2 IP (D 0 ) values than D 0 -from-b. The fit is performed in two steps. First, the invariant mass distributions are fitted to determine the D 0 meson inclusive yield and the number of background candidates, then the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP (D 0 )) fit is performed for candidates with mass within \u00b120 MeV/c 2 around the fitted value of the D 0 mass. In the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP (D 0 )) fit, the number of background candidates is constrained to the value obtained from the invariant mass fit, scaled to the selected mass range.",

The geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies are estimated using pp simulated samples, validated with data. The difference between the distributions of the track multiplicity in the pPb and pp collisions is accounted for by studying the efficiency in bins of the track multiplicity, and weighting the efficiency according to the multiplicity distributions seen in pPb and Pbp data. The related systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 4.

The systematic uncertainty associated to the determination of the signal yield has contributions -6 -JHEP10(2017)090 from the signal and background models. The uncertainty associated to the modelling of the signal is studied by using alternative models of single or sum of two Gaussian functions to fit the invariant mass in the forward and backward samples. A variation of the parameters which are fixed in the default model, within the ranges indicated by the simulation, is also explored. The largest difference between the nominal and the alternative fits is taken as the uncertainty on the method, which results in a bin-dependent uncertainty, not exceeding 5%. The effect due to background modelling in the invariant mass fit is studied by using an exponential as an alternative to the linear function. This uncertainty is found to be negligible. For the fit to the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP (D 0 )) distribution, the \u03c1 L and \u03c1 R parameters of the prompt signal component are varied within the ranges studied in simulation. The distribution of combinatorial backgrounds is studied with candidates in different background mass regions. The shape of the distribution for the D 0 -from-b component is fixed when studying the variation of its fraction. The same procedure is followed to estimate the uncertainty on the log 10 (\u03c7 2 IP (D 0 )) fits.

The efficiency measurement is affected by the imperfect modelling of the tracking efficiency by simulation, which is corrected using a data-driven method [59], and the uncertainty of the correction is propagated into an uncertainty on the D 0 yield. The limited sizes of the simulated samples affect the precision of the efficiency, especially in the high multiplicity region. Another source of uncertainty is introduced by the choice of variable representing the detector occupancy, used to weight the distributions. The number of tracks and the number of hits in the VELO and in the TT and OT are all considered separately. The largest difference between the efficiencies when weighted by each of these variables and their average, which is the default, is taken as systematic uncertainty. An additional uncertainty comes from the detector occupancy distribution estimated in backward and forward data. The effects are summed in quadrature, yielding a total uncertainty on the tracking efficiency of 3% and 5% for the forward and backward collision sample respectively.",

The free nucleon PDF CT10NLO [65] is also used as a reference for the cross-section predictions in pp collisions.

Differential cross-section d\u03c3 dy * (mb) for prompt D 0 meson production as a function of |y * | in pPb forward and backward data, respectively. The first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the component of the systematic uncertainty that is uncorrelated between bins and the third is the correlated component. a function of rapidity are shown in figure 7 where a different suppression between the two charmonium states can be observed. In figures 5 and 6 the measurements are also compared with calculations in the CGC frameworks CGC1 [67] and CGC2 [68]. Both models include the effect of the saturation of partons at small x. The CGC models are found to be able to describe the trend of prompt D 0 meson nuclear modifications as a function of p T and of rapidity. The uncertainty band for CGC1 is much smaller than for CGC2 and for the nuclear PDF calculations, since CGC1 only contains the variation of charm quark masses and factorisation scale which largely cancel in this ratio of cross-sections. In the context of pPb collisions, recent measurements have shown that long-range collective effects, which have previously been observed in relatively large nucleus-nucleus collision systems, may also be present in smaller collision systems at large charged particle multiplicities [71][72][73][74]. If these effects are due to the creation of a hydrodynamic system, momentum anisotropies at the quark level can arise, which may modify the final distribution of observed heavyquark hadrons [75]. Since the measurements in this analysis do not consider a classification in charged particle multiplicity, potential modifications in high-multiplicity events are weakened as the presented observables are integrated over charged particle multiplicity.",

The measurement is performed in the range of D 0 transverse momentum p T < 10 GeV/c, in both backward and forward collisions covering the ranges 1.5 < y * < 4.0 and \u22125.0 < y * < \u22122.5. This is the first measurement in this rapidity region down to zero transverse momentum of the D 0 meson. Nuclear modification factors and forward-backward production ratios are also measured in the same kinematic range. Both observables are excellent probes to constrain the PDF uncertainties, which are currently significantly larger than the uncertainties on the experimental results. A large asymmetry in the forward-backward production is observed, which is consistent with the expectations from nuclear parton distribution functions, and colour glass condensate calculations for the forward rapidity part. The results are found to be consistent with the theoretical predictions considered.",
