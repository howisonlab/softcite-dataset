For very large values of z, i.e. z > 0.8, we observe the kaon multiplicity ratio to fall below the lower limits expected from calculations based on leading and nextto-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Also, the kaon multiplicity ratio shows a strong dependence on the missing mass of the single-kaon production process. This suggests that within the perturbative quantum chromodynamics formalism an additional correction may be required, which takes into account the phase space available for hadronisation.",

These studies have two disadvantages: i) that only information about D h q + D h q is accessible, and ii) without invoking model-dependent algorithms for quark-flavour tagging only limited flavour separation is possible. In contrast, the analysis of semi-inclusive measurements of deep-inelastic leptonnucleon scattering (SIDIS) is advantageous in that q and q can be accessed separately and full flavour separation is possible in principle. Here, the disadvantage is that in the pQCD description of a SIDIS measurement FFs appear convoluted with parton distribution functions (PDFs).",

Similarly, the impact of theoretical uncertainties, e.g. scale uncertainties, is largely reduced in the ratio. Also, while pQCD cannot predict values of multiplicities, limits for certain multiplicity ratios can be predicted.

For \u03c3 h in the current fragmentation region, the sum contains an additional convolution with the fragmentation function of the produced parton. The rather complicated NLO expressions for these cross sections can be found e.g. in Ref. [6]. Below, we will use only pQCD LO expressions for the cross section, while later for the presentation of results also multiplicity calculations obtained using NLO expressions will be shown. It is important to note that in the SIDIS factorisation approach the only ingredients that depend on the nucleon type are the nucleon PDFs, while the fragmentation functions depend neither on the nucleon type nor on x. In the LO approximation for the multiplicity, the sum over parton species a = q, q does not contain convolutions but only simple products of PDFs f a (x, Q 2 ), weighted by the square of the electric charge e a of the quark expressed in units of elementary charge, and FFs D h",

(5) receives corrections on the level of \u223c \u03b1 S /2\u03c0 . Using the MMHT14 NLO PDF set [10], the ratio (\u016b +d)/(u + d) is 0.440 \u00b1 0.023, but according to our calculation the lower limit is about 15% lower than this limit. 1 We note that because of the large uncertainties of s, s and D str , reasonable uncertainties are presently calculable only for the lower limits of R K , and not for R K itself. These uncertainties amount to about 3% for LO and about 6% for NLO predictions. In both cases the uncertainty of the (\u016b +d)/(u + d) ratio dominates, while in NLO also uncertainties of the gluon PDF play some role. The choice of FFs has negligible impact on LO or NLO calculations of the lower R K limit. The actual predictions for R K based on DSS [7] at LO accuracy and DEHSS17 [8] at NLO accuracy are larger than the lower limits for R K , which is expected as in the above calculation of lower limits the strange-quark contribution to kaon fragmentation was neglected. It was verified that when using more recent PDF sets (e.g. NNPDF30 at LO and NLO accuracy [11]), the R K values increase by about 10% for all cases that were discussed above. Hence our choice of the MSTW08 LO and MMHT14 NLO PDFs sets leads to a rather conservative estimation of the lower limit on R K .",

We found that four convolution integrals can effectively be neglected at high z, and only two that are related to convolutions of C 1 qq and C 1 qg have an important impact on the final results. The term related to C 1 qq alone would lead to an increase of R K above the limit given by Eq. (5). In contrast, the term related to C 1 qg , although appearing in a symmetric form in numerator and denominator, is negative, so that the lower limit of R K falls below that given by Eq. (5). We note that D fav or its convolution appears always in all relevant terms. Its choice hence appears to be rather irrelevant for the final result, as it largely cancels in the predicted lower limit for R K at NLO.",

Therefore, the R K predictions including these resummation corrections would be even closer to the expectations given by Eq. (5) than the NLO predictions shown below without including these corrections. An interesting work related to hadron-mass corrections [16] was originally criticised in Ref. [17], but the discussion is ongoing [18]. The approach discussed in this work allows one to obtain a value of R K below the limits discussed above. However, this approach seems to go beyond the standard factorisation theorem and corrections to D h q are needed, which depend on the type of target nucleon and produced hadron h. There were also other developments, e.g. Refs. [19][20][21], which are very important for a better understanding of the hadronisation process. Still, they appear to not effectively impact the predictions for R K in the high-z region at COMPASS kinematics.",

The target was longitudinally polarised but in the present analysis the data are averaged over the target polarisation, which leads to an effectively vanishing target polarisation on a level of better than 1%. The COMPASS two-stage spectrometer has a polar angle acceptance of \u00b1180 mrad, and it is capable of detecting charged particles with momenta above 0.5 GeV/c. The ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) was used to identify pions, kaons and protons. Its radiator volume was filled with C 4 F 10 leading to a threshold for pion, kaon and proton identification of about 3 GeV/c, 9 GeV/c and 18 GeV/c respectively. Efficient pion and kaon separation is possible with high purity for momenta between 12 GeV/c and 40 GeV/c. Two trigger types were used in the analysis. The \"inclusive\" trigger was based on a signal from a combination of hodoscope signals from the scattered muon. The \"semi-inclusive\" trigger required an energy deposition in one of the hadron calorimeters. The experimental set-up is described in more detail in Ref. [22].",

For a given event, reconstructed variables were used to count reconstructed events and generated variables to count generated events. In order to account for the strong z-dependence of the multiplicity in the large-z region, in this analysis the acceptance is unfolded as in Ref. [3] for x and Q 2 but not for z. Various methods for z unfolding were investigated in detailed studies, see appendix A for an example. The results presented in this Letter are obtained using the simplest version of z unfolding, i.e. unfolding only the dependence of R K on z corr . Here, z corr denotes the reconstructed value of z in the experiment, corrected by the average difference between the generated and reconstructed values of z, where the latter are determined by Monte Carlo simulations. In the left panel of Fig. 2, the K \u2212 over K + acceptance ratio obtained from x and Q 2 unfolding is shown as a function of the reconstructed z-variable in the first x-bin.

This difference between K \u2212 and K + yields is caused by the non-negligible thickness of the COMPASS target, which amounts to about 50% of a hadron interaction length, combined with a considerably larger absorption cross section for interactions of negative kaons compared to positive ones, see e.g. the results on the K \u00b1 -deuteron cross section in Ref. [25]. Depending on the longitudinal position of the primary interaction point Z vtx , the produced kaons traverse a varying thickness of the material contained in the 120 cm long target. As a result, more negative than positive kaons are absorbed when the interaction took place at the beginning of the target as compared to an interaction at the end of the target. It is verified that once the acceptance correction was applied, the obtained R K ratio is flat as a function of Z vtx . For the K \u2212 over K + acceptance ratio a 2% systematic uncertainty is used; this value is dominated by possible trigger-dependent variations of the multiplicities mentioned in the previous paragraph. The stability of R K is tested on data using several variables that are defined in the spectrometer coordinate system. The most sensitive one is the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of the produced kaon. The direction \u03c6 = 0 lies in the bending plane of the dipole magnets and points towards the side, to which positive particles are bent.",

In certain cases the charged-kaon multiplicity ratio is found to vary by up to 25%, with particularly small values close to a peak at \u03c6 = 0. This observation is accounted for by a systematic uncertainty that is taken as the difference between the multiplicity ratio measured over the full \u03c6-range and the one measured for |\u03c6| > 0.5. Typically, the relative uncertainty related to this \u03c6-dependence ranges between 3% and 11%, which makes it the dominant systematic uncertainty.

Additional studies were performed on data concerning misidentification probabilities of pions and protons being identified as kaons by varying the ratio of the kaon likelihood, which is the largest of all likelihoods in the selected sample, to the next-to-largest likelihood hypothesis,  As the COMPASS muon beam is (naturally) polarised with an average polarisation of \u22120.80 \u00b1 0.04, a spin-dependent contribution to the total lepton-nucleon cross section cannot be neglected a priori. This contribution is proportional to sin \u03c6 h and expected to be smaller than the spin-independent one, which is proportional to cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03c6 h [26]. Here, \u03c6 h denotes the azimuthal angle between the lepton-scattering plane and the hadron-production plane in the centre-of-mass frame of virtual photon and nucleon. Studies performed for previous COMPASS measurements [2,3] show that these effects can be neglected when using \u03c6 h -integrated multiplicities, as it is done in this analysis. Altogether, the total relative systematic uncertainty on R K is found to range between 5% and 12% depending upon the z-bin.

It is observed that with increasing z the values of R K are increasingly undershooting the expectations from LO and NLO calculations. The discrepancy between the COMPASS results and the NLO predictions reaches a factor of about 2.5 at the largest value of z. As the difference between the lower limit in LO and the NLO DEHSS prediction obtained under the assumption D str = 0 is never larger than 20%, it is very unlikely that any prediction obtained at NNLO would be able to account for such a large discrepancy.

However, the discrepancy between COMPASS results and both LO and NLO predictions is observed to be the same in the two x-bins within experimental uncertainties. The observed discrepancy cannot be explained by the threshold resummations from Ref. [15], as discussed in Section 2. The usage of DSS fragmentation functions [7] in the LO ansatz presented in Ref. [16] leads to a decrease of the R K prediction by about 25% in the last z bin. It is thus not enough to account for the observed discrepancy. However, larger changes could be obtained if FFs decrease to zero faster than expected in the DSS parametrisation. It is worth noting that in the LEPTO event generator a different factorisation approach is used, which is based on string hadronisation. However, it does not describe the data at high z, in spite of its considerably higher flexibility in comparison to the pQCD approach. Perhaps a special tuning of certain string fragmentation parameters, for example those governing low-mass string hadronisation, would lead to a better description of the data.",

The larger the value of z, the smaller is the number of possible final states in the process under study. The natural variable to study the \"exclusivity\" of a process is the missing mass, which is approximately given 2 . As the factor \u03bd(1 \u2212 z) appears in the missing mass definition, both the z and the \u03bd dependence of R K may be described simultaneously by this variable. Fig. 6 shows that R K as a function of M X follows a rather smooth behaviour.
