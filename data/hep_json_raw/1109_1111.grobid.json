The single pion production in the N N interactions is the main inelastic process at energies below 1 GeV. Despite the fact that a lot of experiments have been performed, many questions on this process are not yet answered. One of them is the question about a contribution of the isoscalar (I = 0) channel to the inelastic neutron-proton collisions. Since the neutron-proton scattering amplitude contains both isoscalar and isovector (I = 1) parts, a detailed investigation of the single pion production in the pp collisions (isovector contribution only) might give the most accurate information about the isovector channel which, in combination with the neutron-proton data, would allow one to extract correctly the contribution of the isoscalar channel.",

Most of them are constructed for the energy region near the production threshold and can not be applied at higher energies. For the energy range about 1 GeV the one-pion exchange (OPE) model [1] assumes a dominance of the one-pion exchange contribution to the inelastic amplitude. Pole diagram matrix elements were calculated using a beforehand form factor. The form factor function was obtained by fitting experimental data, so in fact this was a semiphenomenological model. In addition, only the P 33 partial wave was taken into account in the intermediate \u03c0N channel [2]. Nevertheless, this model predicts (up to a normalization factors) with a reasonable accuracy the differential spectra of the pp \u2192 pn\u03c0 + and pp \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 reactions in the energy range 600-1300 MeV [2,3]. At the same time discrepancies between the measured total cross sections for these reactions and the model predictions are sizeable enough.",

These values together with statistic of the events are listed in Table 1.  Fig. 1. The elastic cross section value given in Table 1 was calculated as 4\u03c0A 0 where A 0 is the coefficient in front of the Legender polynomial P 0 (z) in fitting the angular distribution by the Legender expansion in the angular range -0.95\u2264 cos\u03b8 \u22640.95. This range was chosen in order to take into account a loss of events due to forward elastic scattering when a slow proton had a short recoil path and could not be seen in the bubble chamber (at the momentum less than 80 MeV/c) or was missed under the scanning. This interval was determined by examining the stability of the Legender coefficients with decreasing fitted range of the angular distribution. Our value of the total elastic cross section is less than that given in works [4,6] approximately by 13%. We do not know the reason for this discrepancy: it could arise due to i) an insufficient control of the loss of events with small scattering angles or ii) an uncorrect calculation of the millibarn-equivalent in the chamber. To control the loss of events in the forward scattering we use the short-cut range for fitting of the differential cross section which should repair this shortcoming. Of course we have about 7% unmeasured events which were apportioned to the fraction of the fitted hypotheses for the cross section calculations. But it is difficult to believe that the fraction of missing elastic events is much larger. The missing events have superimposed second tracks: this topology is not the elastic scattering one, except for events with disposition of the scattering plane strongly in the normal direction to the frame of a film. As concerns the millibarn-equivalent calculation, we would like to pay attention that the values for the single pion production cross sections given in Table 1 are in a fairly good agreement with the above mentioned work [4].",

In this spin-orbital momentum decomposition we follow the formalism given in [7,8,9].

Following this decomposition, we use spectroscopic notation 2S+1 L J for the description of the initial state, the system of two final particles and the system \"spectator and two-particle final state\". For the initial pp system, the states with total momenta J \u2264 2 and angular momenta L = 0, 1, 2, 3 between two protons are taken into account. For the final three-particle system, we restrict ourselves in the fitting procedure by angular momenta L 2 = 0, 1, 2 and L \u2032 = 0, 1, 2. Due to nonresonant nature of the pp system in the energy region investigated here, there is no factorization of initial and final vertices, and the transition amplitude depends on all quantum numbers which characterize a partial wave (index \u03b1). Moreover, due to contribution of the triangle singularities, the production parameters can be complex-valued. The best description was obtained with the parameterization:",

(10) Figure 9 shows the result of such calculation at 1628 MeV/c using the value for the \u03c3(np \u2192 pp\u03c0 \u2212 ) cross section interpolated from the experimental data [15,16] (black square). The result of the work [14] where the partial wave analysis of the earlier pp \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 data was performed together with the np \u2192 pp\u03c0 \u2212 measurements taken with continues neutron beam is shown by the band. The isoscalar cross section calculated using the result of this analysis and new pp \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 data at 1628 MeV is fully consistent with this band and is not shown here.",
