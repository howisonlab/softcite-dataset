This topology is defined by particle activity in the ALICE central barrel and absence of particle activity outside. The fraction of events satisfying the double-gap requirement R DG is found to be 7.63 \u00b1 0.02(stat.) \u00b1 0.87(syst.) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The background of this double-gap fraction is estimated by studying the contributions of non-diffractive, single-and double-diffractive dissociation processes as modelled by Monte Carlo event generators, and is found to be about 10%.",

Additional detectors for triggering and event classification are available in the range \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < 5.1. Double-gap events can be identified by requiring activity in the central barrel and by the absence of activity in the more forward regions. At LHC energies, about 25 mb, i.e. one third of the inelastic hadronic cross section, are of diffractive origin as e.g. measured by ALICE in a previous study [2]. These diffractive events are mediated by a Pomeron [3] exchange. Central-diffractive events show the characteristic double-gap topology due to their double-Pomeron exchange. The centraldiffractive cross section is predicted to be about 800 \u00b5b [4].",

The first two layers are Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD) covering \u22122.0 < \u03b7 < 2.0 and \u22121.4 < \u03b7 < 1.4. The ITS is used for vertex reconstruction and, together with the Time-Projection Chamber (TPC), for tracking. In the forward region, the VZERO scintillator hodoscope for trigger purposes is located at \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 and 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1. In addition multiplicity-density measurements can be performed by the Forward-Multiplicity Detector (FMD) situated at \u22123.4 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 and 1.7 < \u03b7 < 5.0. It is a silicon strip detector built for multiplicity density measurements. The low material budget and low magnetic field of 0.5 T lead arXiv:1301.3507v1 [hep-ex] 15 Jan 2013 to a low single particle p T -threshold of 17 MeV/c for 50% detection efficiency.

In central diffractive processes, the protons can either stay intact or break up. The double-gap topology can be exploited as filter for central diffraction. However, at topology level, Pomeron, Reggeon or photon exchanges cannot be distinguished. The contribution from Reggeon exchanges is assumed to be comparable to lower energies, while the Pomeron contribution is expected to increase with energy. The ALICE pseudorapidity coverage and the corresponding gap definitions are shown in Fig. 1. The gaps are defined by the absence of activity induced by the passage of particles in the trigger signals of VZERO, FMD and SPD in the pseudorapidity ranges of \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22120.9 and 0.9 < \u03b7 < 5.1. The central activity is determined using SPD in the range of \u22120.9 < \u03b7 < 0.9. This double-gap configuration is a trade-off of large gaps suppressing background and a reasonable coverage for the centrally produced signal.  ",

The minimum-bias trigger is the logical-OR of the two VZERO and the SPD trigger signal, called MB or . A total of 300 million MB or triggers are used for this analysis. Luminosity determination within this data sample is possible by using the minimum-bias cross section \u03c3 MBand available from van-der-Meer scans and the MB and trigger count. The MB and trigger is derived from the coincidence of the two VZERO subdetectors. Furthermore, a monitoring of the gap-fraction for all involved detectors is done on a run-by-run basis. Runs deviating by more than 3\u03c3 from the data-taking period mean are rejected. In addition to the run selection, an event selection is applied. Furthermore, a vertex within \u00b14 cm of the interaction point in direction of the beam axis is required to ensure a continuous gap coverage. Moreover, pileup is rejected by identifying multiple vertices reconstructed from the SPD information. The number of double-gap events N DG and the number of MB AND events N MBand are analysed on a run-by-run basis.",

For example, doublediffractive dissociative events do not necessarily contain a vertex. This effect is estimated to be about 6%. Furthermore, the central activity can be missed, leading to a bias to lower cross section of approximately 5%. On the contrary, missing a particle in the gap shifts the cross section about 5% towards higher values. The uncorrelated error contribution is estimated to be 1.4% from the spread of the data-taking period means.",

Both PHOJET and PYTHIA6 are used with a tune for single and double diffractive dissociation but without central diffraction [2] in order to generate the data set for comparisons. However, further tuning is needed since generator multiplicity distributions are too low by up to 30% and 40% in the central and forward region, respectively. A first estimate of the bias caused by this deviation assumes the gaps to be uncorrelated and the multiplicity to be distributed according to a negative binomial distribution. This estimate leads to a reduction of the double-gap fraction seen in MC data as shown in Table 1. Both generators are unable to describe the double-gap fraction 7.63 \u2022 10 \u22124 observed in ALICE data. These findings can be interpreted as hints for central diffraction, since the simulated background amounts only to about 10%. However, the ALICE acceptance and efficiency for central-diffractive events need to be studied using Monte Carlo data.",
