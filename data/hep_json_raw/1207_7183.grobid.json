            "text": "The observations of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) have made notable improvements in the last few years [1]   [7]. However, although some critical parts of the interpretation rely on the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the air shower development, very forward particle emission in the hadronic interactions, which are relevant to the precise understanding of air showers, have been poorly understood thus far, especially at such high energies. To reduce the uncertainty in MC air shower simulations, the Large Hadron Collider forward (LHCf) experiment has performed measurements of the neutral particles emitted to the very forward region of proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In 2010, the operations at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 900 GeV were completed. The photon energy spectra obtained from the 7 TeV data have been previously reported elsewhere [8]. Below this energy, the measurement of the P T spectra of \u03c0 0 s by UA7 in the rapidity region Y = 5.05 -6.65 [9] is available. It is interesting to have a single-photon measurement at 0 degrees at different collision energies in order to discuss energy dependence. In this paper, we report the inclusive photon energy spectra in the very forward region for \u221a s = 900 GeV proton-proton collisions with the same detectors and analysis methods as those used for the \u221a s = 7 TeV analysis.",

In these fills, the LHC operated with one crossing bunch and one non-crossing bunch at IP1 in Fill IDs 1068 and 1069 and with four crossing bunches and three non-crossing bunches at IP1 in Fill ID 1128. The luminosity (L) at IP1 during these fills was measured by the ATLAS experiment [16].  inelastic collisions (N inel ) during the three fills was calculated to be 1.58\u00d710 7 . The luminosity during the three fills is summarized in Tab.1. During the \u221a s = 900 GeV fills, the LHCf operations were performed with a high-gain operation of the PMTs for the sampling layers to detect photons with energies as low as 50 GeV with a nearly 100 % trigger efficiency and with a lower threshold with respect to the \u221a s = 7 TeV data. The typical PMT gain for the high-gain operations was 3 -5 times higher than the nominal gain that was used to obtain the 7 TeV data. Neither the saturation of PMTs nor the range of ADC caused problems because the maximum energy of the incident photons were expected to be 8 times lower than those for the 7 TeV data. The data acquisition (DAQ) triggers were generated from beam pickup signals (BPTX) followed by \"shower trigger\" signals. The trigger condition of the shower trigger was that signals from any three successive scintillator layers in any calorimeters exceed the predefined threshold (approximately 17 MeV for high gain). The average DAQ live times during the LHCf \u221a s = 900 GeV operations was 99.2 % (Arm1) and 98.0 % (Arm2).",

Each PMT gain was premeasured for various HVs using N 2 laser calibration. The calibration of the deposited energy in each layer was performed for different HV settings (low-, nominal-, and highgain operations) using 50 -200 GeV/c electron beams and 150 GeV/c muon beams at the CERN SPS [13]. The non-uniformity of the light yield of each scintillator layer was measured using a \u03b2-ray source before assembling the detectors. Because a fraction of the shower particles leak out of the sides of the calorimeters ('shower leakage'), the total energy deposited was corrected for 'shower leakage' by a function of the shower impact position. This function was determined by the MC simulation. The impact positions of the showers were determined using the information from the position-sensitive layers. The events that fell within 2 mm of the edges of calorimeters were removed from the analysis to avoid the degradation of the energy resolution due to 'shower leakage'. We set the energy threshold of this analysis to 50 GeV to avoid background from the interactions between secondary particles and the beam pipe, which was expected to be concentrated below 50 GeV according to a MC simulation. The trigger efficiencies of both Arms were also checked by two samples. One was an unbiased data sample with nominal gain triggered by the shower triggers at the opposite side of the detector. The other was the detector MC simulation for both high and nominal gains. Considering the difference of gains (a factor 3 -5) between the high and nominal gain operations, the two methods gave consistent results. We found that the efficiencies were 100% for > 30 GeV incident photons for both arms for the higher gain. This was sufficiently lower than the 50 GeV analysis threshold.",

Additionally, we checked \u03c0 0 mass peaks in the 7 TeV data with a higher gain taken in a different period. We found +2.7 % (+0.7 %) differences of the mass peaks from those for the nominal gain in Arm1 (Arm2). These differences were compatible with the uncorrelated energy scale errors (\u00b13.5 %) quoted for the energy scale calibration of the detectors using the SPS beams or a longterm time variation. Conservatively, they were added to the energy scale's systematic error in quadrature. Finally, the energy scale uncertainties were estimated to be [\u221210.2 %, +1.8 %] and [\u22126.6 %, +2.2 %] for Arm1 and Arm2, respectively. The systematic uncertainties of the energy spectra due to the energy scale uncertainty are listed for the Arm1 and the Arm2 detectors in Tab. 2 and Tab. 3, respectively. The energy of photons in multi-hit events with more than one photons incident on a single tower would not be reconstructed correctly. We estimated the possible bias in the energy reconstruction due to double-incident events using MC simulation using QGSJET II-03. We found that the number of events whose true energies were modified by more than 2 % was very small. The fraction of such events was expected to be less than 1 % of the events having a total incident energy of >40 GeV. Although such multi-hit events can be identified using the lateral distributions measured by the positionsensitive layers, we did not apply the multi-hit cut or any correction to the spectra in this analysis to avoid a bias due to the misidentification of single photon events as multi-hit events.

Small modifications of the template (widening with respect to the peak position up to 30 % and a constant shift up to 1.0 r.l. for Arm1 and 0.8 r.l. for Arm2, to give the best match with the data) provide the size of uncertainty in the correction factors to the photon spectra.

Because the flux of the secondary particles produced by \u221a s = 900 GeV proton-proton collisions was expected to be uniform over the acceptance of the LHCf detectors, the beam center could not be determined directly from our measurements. In this analysis, we assumed that the beam center was at the center position determined by the alignment survey of the detectors. The beam center was located near the center of the small calorimeter of each Arm as shown in Fig. 1. The beam position and the beam angle were monitored by the Beam Position Monitor (BPMSW) installed \u00b1 21 m from IP1 [26]. The fill-by-fill fluctuation of the calculated 'beam center' at the LHCf detectors during the period for the presented data set was approximately 4 mm. We assigned a systematic uncertainty of \u00b12 mm to the beam center. To estimate the effect of this uncertainty on the energy spectra, we defined an area that had a slightly narrower acceptance than the calorimeter, and an energy spectrum was generated from the events falling within this area. Additionally, four spectra were made by shifting the area by \u00b12 mm vertically and horizontally. As a systematic uncertainty of energy spectra due to the uncertainty of the beam center, we assigned the differences of the spectra as shown in Tab. 4 and Tab. 5 for the Arm1 and the Arm2 detectors, respectively.

For the small tower, we selected events with the distance (r) from the beam center less than 11 mm, which corresponded to the pseudorapidity range of \u03b7 > 10. 15 (the circles in Fig. 1). Similarly, for the large tower, we set the conditions as 22 mm < r < 44 mm, which corresponded to the pseudorapidity range of 8.77 < \u03b7 < 9.46 (the arcs in Fig. 1). The calorimeters did not uniformly cover the pseudorapidity ranges as shown in Fig. 1. We confirmed that there was a negligible pseudorapidity dependence of the energy spectra inside each pseudorapidity range. The reconstructed photon energy spectra of Arm1 and Arm2 are shown in Fig. 3 in units of differential cross-sections d\u03c3/dEd\u2126, where E is the photon energy and \u2126 is the solid angle. The differential crosssection was calculated as d\u03c3/dEd\u2126 = 1/( Ldt) dN/dEd(cos\u03b8)d\u03c6, where N is the number of events in each energy bin, Ldt is the integrated luminosity after the correction for the DAQ live time for each Arm and \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and the azimuthal angles with respect to the beam axis, respectively. Considering the geometrical acceptance of the calorimeters, the averages of the polar angle \u03b8 are 39 \u00b5rad and 234 \u00b5rad for the small and the large tower, respectively. The error bars in Fig. 3 indicate the statistical uncertainty; the hatched areas show the systematic errors in which the particle identification and the beam position uncertainties were taken into account. Because the systematic uncertainties due to the energy determination may be correlated between Arm1 and Arm2 [8], they were not taken into account in Fig. 3.

The left and the right panels show the results of the small towers and the large towers, respectively. The pseudorapidity coverages of the small and the large towers are \u03b7 > 10.15 and 8.77 < \u03b7 < 9.46, respectively. Considering the geometrical shape of the calorimeters, the averages of the polar angle \u03b8 with respect to the beam axis are 39 \u00b5rad and 234 \u00b5rad for the small and the large towers, respectively. The error bars indicate the statistical errors, and the hatched areas indicate the total systematic uncertainties that come from particle identification and the 'beam center' position.  Figure 5: Ratio of the MC spectra divided by the data in each energy bin. The left and the right panels show the spectra for the pseudorapidity ranges of \u03b7 > 10.15 and 8.77 < \u03b7 < 9.46, respectively. The colored plots indicate the results of MC, QGSJET II-03 (blue), PYTHIA 8.145 (yellow), SIBYLL 2.1 (green), EPOS 1.99 (magenta) and DPMJET 3.04 (red). To describe the size of the errors, the experimental data are also shown on the ratio of unity with the statistical uncertainty (error bars) and the total uncertainty of data (the black hatches). The luminosity uncertainty was not included. The statistical uncertainties of each MC are shown as the error bars of MC.",
