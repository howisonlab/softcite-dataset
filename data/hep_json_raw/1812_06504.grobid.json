While the couplings to the top ( y t ) and bottom ( y b ) quarks are known with fair precision, there is E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. still a relatively large uncertainty in the measurement of the couplings to lighter quarks such as the coupling to the charm quark ( y c ). A proof-of-concept study determining limits on the modification of the SM Higgs boson coupling ( y SM c ) to the charm quark, \u03ba c = y c /y SM c , from the Higgs boson transverse momentum (p H T ) distribution was performed in Ref. [12]. Reinterpreting the ATLAS Collaboration measurements in Ref. [13], this analysis yields the overall bounds \u03ba c \u2208 [ \u221216, 18] at 95% confidence level (CL). Using the same data set, a reinterpretation of a search by the ATLAS Collaboration for the H \u2192 J / \u03c8\u03b3 channel [14] yields |\u03ba c | < 429 at 95% CL [15]. More recently, studies from the ATLAS Collaboration [16,17], using data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , yield an observed upper limit on the H \u2192 J / \u03c8 branching fraction of 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 95% CL that is an improvement of about a factor two with respect to the result obtained in Ref.

Additionally, we include a search for the Higgs boson produced with large p T and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark (bb) pair [29] in the combination of the p H T spectra. The differential cross sections for the following observables are combined: p H T , the Higgs boson rapidity |y H |, the number of hadronic jets N jets , and the transverse momentum of the leading hadronic jet p jet T . We interpret the p H T spectrum in terms of Higgs boson couplings. In order to take into account as many degrees of freedom as possible, multiple couplings are varied simultaneously. We present results obtained by varying simultaneously (i) the modifier of the Higgs boson coupling to the charm quark \u03ba c and the bottom quark \u03ba b , (ii) the modifier of the Higgs boson coupling to the top quark \u03ba t and the coefficient c g of the anomalous direct coupling to the gluon field in the heavy top quark mass limit, and (iii) \u03ba t and \u03ba b .",

In the case of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, the dominant production mode at the LHC, finite quark mass effects and moderate variations to Higgs boson couplings may manifest themselves through distortions of the p H T spectrum. We interpret the p H T spectrum for gluon fusion in terms of modifications of the couplings of the Higgs boson using two models: one tailored to heavy quarks and thus sensitive to effects at high p T [30,31], and the other considering the effect of lighter quarks in the gluon fusion loop [12]. The cross section for Higgs boson production in association with top quarks is taken to scale quadratically with \u03ba t . The other production processes are taken to be independent of these couplings. The coupling modifiers are described in the context of the \u03ba-framework [32]:",

In the case of the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis, the fiducial phase space is defined by requiring the ratio of the leading (subleading) photon p T to the diphoton mass to be greater than 1/3 (1/4). In addition, for each photon candidate the scalar sum of the generator-level p T of stable particles contained in a cone of radius R = 0.3 around the candidate is required to be less than 10 GeV, where R = \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 is the angular separation between particles and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle between two particles in radians. The selected photon pairs are categorized according to their estimated relative invariant mass resolution [25]. In the case of the H \u2192 ZZ analysis, the 4-lepton mass is required to be greater than 70 GeV, the leading Z boson candidate invariant mass must be greater than 40 GeV, and leptons must be separated in angular space by at least R > 0.02. Furthermore, at least two leptons must each have a p T > 10 GeV and at least one a p T > 20 GeV. The selected events are categorized according to their lepton configuration in the final state (4 electrons, 4 muons, or 2 electrons and 2 muons). In the case of the H \u2192 bb analysis, the analysis strategy requires the presence of a single anti-k T jet with a distance parameter of 0.8, p T > 450 GeV, and |\u03b7| < 2.5. For this analysis, the data is not unfolded to a fiducial phase space. Soft and wide-angle radiation is removed using the soft-drop grooming algorithm [47,48]. The jet mass after application of the soft-drop algorithm, m SD , peaks close to the Higgs boson mass in the case of signal events. To avoid finite-cone effects and the nonperturbative regime of the m SD calculation, events are selected based on the dimensionless mass scale variable for QCD jets defined as \u03c1 = log m 2 SD /p 2 T [47], which relates the jet p T to the jet mass. Events with isolated electrons, muons, or \u03c4 leptons with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 are vetoed in order to reduce the background from SM electroweak processes, and events with a missing transverse momentum greater than 140 GeV are vetoed in order to reduce the background from top quark-antiquark pair production. Additionally, a selection criterion is applied based on the compatibility of the single anti-k T jet with having a twoprong substructure [49][50][51][52]. Events are categorized according to their likelihood of consisting of two b quarks, which is computed using the double-b tagger algorithm [53].",
