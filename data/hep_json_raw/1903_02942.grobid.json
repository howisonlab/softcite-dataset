            "text": "A measurement of jet substructure observables is presented using data collected in 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC with proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Large-radius jets groomed with the trimming and soft-drop algorithms are studied. Dedicated event selections are used to study jets produced by light quarks or gluons, and hadronically decaying top quarks and W bosons. The observables measured are sensitive to substructure, and therefore are typically used for tagging large-radius jets from boosted massive particles. These include the energy correlation functions and the N -subjettiness variables. The number of subjets and the Les Houches angularity are also considered. The distributions of the substructure variables, corrected for detector effects, are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators. They are also compared between the large-radius jets originating from light quarks or gluons, and hadronically decaying top quarks and W bosons.",

This large transverse momentum leads to collimated decay products. They are usually reconstructed in a large-radius jet, whose internal (sub)structure shows interesting features that can be used to identify the particle that initiated the jet formation [1,2]. This is relevant for a host of measurements and searches, which involve identifying the large-radius jets coming from top quarks [3][4][5][6][7]. or Higgs bosons [8][9][10][11], for example in Run",

Given that often large differences have been seen between predictions from MC and data, large correction factors need to be applied to simulation results. Additionally, taggers suffer from large systematic uncertainties as the modelling of the substructure observables is not well constrained [2,12]. Most of these variables have never been measured in data, and performing a proper unfolded measurement is a common request from the theory community. Measuring these observables will help in optimising and developing current and future substructure taggers, as well as tuning hadronization models in the important but still relatively unexplored regime of jet substructure. The choice of variables measured in this paper prioritized jet shapes commonly used in jet tagging, as well as those most useful for model tuning.",

This paper presents measurements of substructure variables in large-radius jets produced in inclusive multijet events and in tt events at \u221a s = 13 TeV using 33 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2016 by the ATLAS experiment. In this analysis, the lepton+jets decay mode of tt events is selected, where one W boson decays into a muon and a neutrino, and the other W boson decays into a pair of quarks. Then the large-radius jets are separated into those that contain all the decay products of a hadronically top quark and those containing only hadronic W boson decay products.",

Additionally non-prompt and mis-reconstructed muons are a separate source of background for the top and W selections. Contributions from other processes were considered and found to be negligible. A data-driven method, following ref. [85], is used to estimate the contribution from the W +jets process while the single-top process is considered part of the signal. At the LHC the production rate of W + +jets events is larger than that of W \u2212 +jets due to the higher density of u-quarks than d-quarks in the proton. This results in more events with positively charged leptons. Other processes do not contribute significantly to this charge asymmetry. The data are used to derive scale factors that correct the normalisation and flavour fraction given by the MC simulation [86].",

In both cases a non-negligible fraction of events have more subjets, indicating the  presence of semi-hard gluon radiation. In the W selection, the instances with one subjet are few, while for the top selection, some fraction of events have two subjets, indicating either non-containment of the top quark decay products, or overlapping subjets that get reconstructed as a single subjet. For the dijet selection, Pythia8 and Sherpa describe the data the best, while for the top selection and W selection, there is more spread among MC predictions. Predictions from Herwig7 are very different from data for the dijet selection, a trend which is consistent across all observables.

The data discriminate between the various MC models probed. In general, Pythia8 for light-quark/gluon large-radius jet observables, and Powheg+Pythia8, Sherpa as well as MG5 aMC@NLO+Pythia8 for top quark and W boson large-radius jet observables, describe the data better than other models. The different hadronisation models in Sherpa in the djiet selection result in similar predictions. For most observables, Herwig7 in the dijet selection, and Powheg+Herwig7 in the top and W selections do not describe the data well. These measurements will be useful in improving the modelling of these substructure variables in MC generators. Since searches that utilise boosted topologies use these observables, or combinations of them, in tagging large-radius jets, a better modelling of them will help to increase the sensitivity of such searches.
