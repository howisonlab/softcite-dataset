The data were collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016 at the Large Hadron Collider, and they correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb-1. An observed (expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs signal strength, defined as the event yield normalised to the Standard Model prediction, of 3.8 (3.4) is obtained at 95% confidence level (CL). Assuming the ratio of the Higgs boson couplings to the Standard Model predictions is independent of the momentum transfer of the Higgs production mechanism considered in the analysis, a combination with the on-shell signal-strength measurements yields an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 14.4 (15.2) MeV.",

            "text": "The observation of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) marks a mile stone towards the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking [3][4][5]. Further studies of the spin, par ity and couplings of the new particle have shown no significant deviation from the predictions for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson [6][7][8][9][10]. Efforts to measure the properties of the Higgs boson are primarily focused on on-shell production. For a Higgs boson at a mass of 125 GeV [10,11], the expected natural width of the SM Higgs boson is r\u2122 ~ 4.1 MeV [12]. However, above 125 GeV offshell production of the Higgs boson has a substantial cross section at the LHC [13][14][15][16], due to the increased phase space as the vector bosons (V = W, Z) and top quark decay products become on-shell with the increasing energy scale. This provides an opportunity to study the Higgs boson properties at higher energy scales. Off-shell production can provide sensitivity to new physics that alters the interactions between the Higgs boson and other fundamental par ticles in the high-mass region [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].",

            "text": "The measured off-shell event yield from gluon-gluon fu sion (ggF) production normalised to the SM prediction, where this ratio is referred to as the signal strength ^off-shell. can be expressed as where ^Off-sheii 'Z/ 's the cross section of the off-shell Higgs bo son production via ggF with subsequent decay into a ZZ pair, and Kg,off-shell and Kz,off-shell are the off-shell coupling modifiers rela tive to the SM predictions associated with the gg H* production and the H* ZZ decay, respectively. The off-shell Higgs boson signal cannot be treated independently of the gg ZZ back ground, as sizeable negative interference effects appear [13]. The interference term is assumed to be proportional to VM-ofCshell = Kg,off-shell \u2022 KZ,off-shell. Similarly, ^on-shell for the on-shell Higgs   [15,25]. The above formalism describing the ratio of off-shell to on-shell cross sections also applies to the vector-boson fu sion (VBF) production mode. As in the previous measurement [26], for a measurement of Th it is necessary to assume that the onshell and off-shell coupling modifiers are the same, and for an upper limit that the on-shell coupling modifiers are not larger than the off-shell couplings. It is also assumed that any new physics which modifies the off-shell signal strength and the off-shell cou plings does not modify the relative phase of the interfering signal and background processes. Further, it is assumed that there are neither sizeable kinematic modifications to the off-shell signal nor new sizeable signals in the search region of this analysis unrelated to an enhanced off-shell signal strength. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have presented studies of the off-shell production of the Higgs boson using Run-1 proton-proton (pp) collisions data [26][27][28][29]. ATLAS obtained an observed (ex pected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs boson signal strength (Zoff-shell) in the range of 5.1-8.6 (6.7-11.0) [26], using the ZZ and WW channels. This range is determined by the assumption that the gg ZZ and gg WW background K-factors, correspond ing to the ratio of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD predic tions to the leading-order (LO) predictions, lie between one-half and twice the value of the gg H* ZZ(WW) signal K-factor. An observed (expected) 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit of Th < 23 (33) MeV was obtained, assuming the gg ZZ(WW) background K-factor is equal to the gg H* ZZ(WW) sig nal K-factor. CMS presented a similar study in the ZZ and WW channels, with observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit of Th < 13(26) MeV [29]. By comparison, the precision of Th from direct on-shell Higgs boson mass measurements alone is approximately 1 GeV [9,30,31], limited by measurement resolution.",

            "text": "This Letter presents an analysis of off-shell Higgs boson produc tion in the ZZ 4L and ZZ 2L2v final states (L = e, z), using 36.1 fb-1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at s/s = 13 TeV. The off-shell region is defined by requiring the invariant mass of the ZZ system (mZZ) to be above the on-shell ZZ production threshold, hence well above the Higgs boson mass, and the on-shell region is defined by a mass window around the 125 GeV resonance. This analysis adopts the same methodology used in the Run-1 analysis reported in Ref. [26]. The analysis for the ZZ 4L final state closely follows the Higgs boson measure ments and high-mass search in the same final state described in Refs. [32,33]. The off-shell Higgs signal strength is extracted using a matrix-element discriminant, defined in Section 4, in a mass re gion 220 GeV < m4L < 2000 GeV. The on-shell signal strength was measured in the 118 GeV < m4L < 129 GeV region in Ref. [32]. The analysis of the ZZ 2L2v channel, described in Section 5, follows a strategy similar to that used in the search for heavy ZZ reso nances described in Ref. [33]. For this channel, the signal strength is extracted from the transverse mass distribution in the 250 to 2000 GeV range. For off-shell production of the Higgs boson, the dominant processes of ggF and VBF are considered. Next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) QCD and NLO EW corrections are known for the off-shell signal process gg H* ^ ZZ [25]. More recently, NLO QCD corrections have also become available for the gg ZZ background and for the signal-background interference [34,35], for which additional details are given in Section 3. Given that the QCD corrections for the off-shell signal processes have only been calcu lated inclusively in the jet multiplicity, the analysis is performed inclusively in jet observables and the event selection is designed to minimise the dependence on the momentum of the ZZ system, which is sensitive to the jet multiplicity.",

ATLAS is a multipurpose detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylin drical geometry and a solid-angle1 * * * coverage of nearly 4n. The inner tracking detector, covering the region |nl < 2.5, consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector and a straw-tube transition-radiation tracker. The innermost layer of the pixel detector, the insertable B-layer [37], was installed between Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC. The inner detector is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T magnetic field, and by a finely segmented lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covering the region |nl < 3.2. A steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter provides coverage in the central region |nl < 1 .7. The endcap and forward regions, covering the pseudorapidity range 1.5 < |nl < 4.9, are instrumented with electromagnetic and hadronic LAr calorimeters, with copper or tungsten as the absorber material. A muon spectrometer system incorporating large super conducting toroidal air-core magnets surrounds the calorimeters. Three layers of precision wire chambers provide muon tracking in the range |n| < 2.7, while dedicated fast chambers are used for triggering in the region |n| < 2.4. The trigger system is com posed of two stages [38]. The first stage, implemented with custom hardware, uses information from calorimeters and muon chambers to reduce the event rate from about 40 MHz to a maximum of 100 kHz. The second stage, called the high-level trigger, reduces the data acquisition rate to about 1 kHz on average. The high-level trigger is software-based and runs reconstruction algorithms simi lar to those used in the offline reconstruction.",

The highest-pT lepton in the quadruplet must satisfy pT > 20 GeV, and the second (third) lepton in pT order is required to have pT > 15 GeV (pT > 10 GeV). Lepton pairs are formed from same-flavour opposite-charge leptons. For each channel, the quadruplet with a lepton pair whose mass is closest to the Z bo son mass is kept.

Other backgrounds, such as triboson production, ttV, Z + jets, and top quark production, constitute less than 2% of the total background in the off-shell signal region, and are either taken from simulation or from dedicated data control regions. Fig. 1(a) shows the observed and expected distributions of m4\u00a3 combining all lepton channels in the off-shell region. The data are in agreement with the SM predictions, with two small excesses at m4\u00a3 around 240 GeV and 700 GeV, each having a significance of about two standard deviations (2a), as evaluated by the high-mass resonance search reported in Ref. [33]. Table 1 shows the expected and observed numbers of events in the signal region and addi tionally in the 400 GeV < m4\u00a3 < 2000 GeV mass range, which is  enriched in signal. The latter mass region was chosen for this table since it is optimal for a counting experiment. The matrix-element kinematic discriminant fully exploits the event kinematics in the centre-of-mass frame of the 4\u00a3 system. It is computed from eight kinematic observables: the three masses m4\u00a3, mi2 and m34, and the leading Z boson production angle and four decay angles defined in Ref. [64]. These observables are used to calculate the matrix elements for the different processes with the MCFM program [15] at LO.

The PDF uncertainty corresponds to the 68% CL varia tions of the nominal PDF set NNPDF30NNLO for both qq ZZ and gg (H* ZZ, as well as the difference from alternative PDF sets. The alternative PDF sets used are CT10NNLO [68] and MMHT2014NNLO [69]. The uncertainty due to PDF is found to be about 3% in the high-mass region considered. The uncertainty due to higher-order QCD corrections (QCD scale uncertainty) is estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales independently, ranging from a factor of one-half to two. The un certainty in the K-factors due to the NLO QCD scale uncertainty is 10-20% as a function of mZZ for the gg-initiated ZZ processes in the probed high-mass region, and ranges from 5% to 10% as a func tion of mZZ for the qq ZZ background. The QCD scale uncer tainties are treated as correlated among the gg-initiated ZZ pro cesses, and uncorrelated with the qq-initiated ZZ process. There are a few additional normalisation uncertainties associated with the NLO K-factors discussed in section 3. In the region below 2mt, the higher-order corrections are computed with a maximum jet transverse momentum of 150 GeV to ensure a good description by the 1/mt expansion. The default scale uncertainty is therefore dou bled for events which have a jet with pT > 150 GeV, corresponding to about 8% of the events in this region. The scale uncertainty is also increased by 50% around the 2mt threshold, with a Gaussiansmoothed transition decreasing to the default uncertainty within 50 GeV of the threshold. This is intended to allow for possible ef fects on the K-factor which have not been estimated as the top quark moves on-shell. It is assumed that the 10-20% NLO QCD scale uncertainty for the gg-initiated ZZ processes covers the as sumption of massless loops above the 2mt threshold, and as well the uncertainties in the 1.2 scale factor estimated only for the NNLO/NLO signal correction but also applied to the background and interference components. These NLO QCD scale uncertainties are larger than those associated with the NNLO QCD signal uncer tainties. The EW correction uncertainty for qq ZZ is evaluated using the same method as in Ref. [26] and its impact is esti mated to be about 1%. The parton-shower uncertainty is evaluated by varying parameters in the parton-shower tunes according to Refs. [49,54] and found to be 2-3% in normalisation.",

The uncertainties in the number of expected events include the statistical uncer tainties from MC samples and systematic uncertainties, summed in quadrature. Empty entries correspond to contributions with event yields smaller than 0.1 events.",
