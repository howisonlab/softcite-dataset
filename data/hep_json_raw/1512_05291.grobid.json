Studies of this structure generally rely on a theoretical model of inelastic scattering of high energy nucleons, where a single parton (quark or gluon from one nucleon or a lepton in DIS experiments) interacts with a single parton from another nucleon. In this approach, the other \"spectator\" partons which do not take part in a hard 2 \u2192 2 parton collision are included in the so-called \"underlying event\".",

For example, processes such as the associated production of the Higgs and W bosons, with the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of b quarks, have substantial DP backgrounds [17].",

The first three measurements utilize a four jet final state, where the transverse momentum of the jets in each jet pair is balanced, resulting in the jets produced at almost opposite azimuthal angles. AFS [18] has found (for jet transverse energy E jet T > 4 GeV and pseudorapidity [31] |\u03b7 jet | \u2264 1) the ratio of DP/2jet cross sections to be 6%\u00b11.5%(stat) \u00b1 2.2%(syst). UA2 [19] retained only jet clusters with transverse momentum p jet T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | < 2 and set a 95% CL limit on the value of the DP cross-section, \u03c3 DP \u2264 0.82 nb. The CDF measurement of the DP fraction in four jet events [20] found a DP cross section of \u03c3 DP = 63 +32 \u221228 nb for jets having p jet T \u2265 25 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | \u2264 3.5. Additional CDF and D0 measurements [21][22][23][24] are based on the DP process comprising two parton scatterings with one of them having a dijet final state and the other having a \u03b3+jet or \u03b3 + b(c)-jet final state. D0 and LHCb measurements [25][26][27]30] probe the final states containing heavy quarkonia. In Ref. [26,27] the production of the studied final states in DP scattering is predicted to dominate the production in a single parton (SP) scattering. In this paper, we report the first measurement of DP scattering in diphoton-dijet (\u03b3\u03b3 +jj) channel.",

Photon candidates are identified as isolated clusters of energy depositions in one of three uranium and liquid argon sampling calorimeters.

In addition, the plastic scintillator intercryostat detector covers the region 1.1 < |\u03b7 det | < 1.4.

The hadronic portion of the calorimeter is located behind the EM section. The calorimeter surrounds a tracking system consisting of a silicon microstrip tracking (SMT) detector and scintillating fiber tracker, both located within a 1.9 T solenoidal magnetic field. The solenoid magnet is surrounded by the central preshower (CPS) detector located immediately before the calorimeter. The CPS consists of approximately one radiation length of lead absorber at normal incidence surrounded by three layers of scintillating strips. The luminosity of colliding beams is measured using plastic scintillator arrays installed in front of the two end calorimeter cryostats [39].",

The events used in this analysis pass the triggers designed to identify high-p T clusters in the EM calorimeter with loose shower shape requirements for photons. These triggers have \u2248 90% efficiency for a photon transverse momentum p \u03b3 T \u2248 16 GeV and are 100% efficient for p \u03b3 T > 35 GeV. To select photon candidates in our data samples, we use the following criteria [40,41]: EM objects are reconstructed using a simple cone algorithm with a cone size of \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.2. Regions with poor photon identification and degraded p \u03b3 T resolution at the boundaries between calorimeter modules and between the central and endcap calorimeters are excluded from the analysis. Each photon candidate is required to deposit more than 96% of the detected energy in the EM section of the calorimeter and to be isolated in the angular region between \u2206R = 0.2 and \u2206R = 0.4 around the center of the cluster: (E iso tot \u2212 E iso core )/E iso core < 0.07, where E iso tot is the total (EM+hadronic) tower energy in the (\u03b7, \u03c6) cone of radius \u2206R = 0.4 and E iso core is EM energy within a radius of \u2206R = 0.2. Candidate EM clusters that match to a reconstructed track are excluded from the analysis. We also require the energy-weighted EM cluster width in the finely-segmented third EM layer to be consistent with that expected for a photon-initiated electromagnetic shower. In addition to the calorimeter isolation cut, we also apply a track isolation cut, requiring the scalar sum of the track transverse momenta in an annulus 0.05 \u2264 \u2206R \u2264 0.4 to be less than 1.5 GeV. To further suppress the jet background, the photons are selected to satisfy the same requirement on a neural network (NN) discriminant as in Ref. [42].",

Each event must contain at least two photons in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.0 and at least two jets with |\u03b7 jet | < 3.5. The photon with the highest p T is named the \"leading photon,\" or first photon, and the photon with the second highest p T is denoted as the second photon. Similar terminology is applied to the jets. Events are selected with the leading photon transverse momentum p \u03b3 T > 16 GeV, the second photon p \u03b3 T > 15 GeV, and jets satisfying 15 < p jet T < 40 GeV. The upper requirement on the p T of the jets increases the fraction of DP events in the sample [22]. The numbers of events with exactly one identified pp collision (1VTX), exactly two identified pp collisions (2VTX), and their ratio are shown in Table II. The pp collision vertices are reconstructed using an track-based algorithm and are sorted according to their tracking activity. The vertices are required to be within |z| < 60 cm from the geometric center of the detector (the detector luminous region RMS is \u223c 20 cm) and have N trk \u2265 3 tracks.

            "text": "\u2022 DP data event model (mixdp): The DP event model is constructed by combining photons and jets from two events drawn from two samples: (a) an inclusive data sample of \u03b3\u03b3 events and (b) a sample of inelastic non-diffractive events selected with a minimum bias trigger (a trigger that only requires hits in the luminosity detectors) and a requirement of at least one reconstructed jet (\"MB\" sample) [22,44]. Both input samples contain events with exactly one reconstructed pp collision vertex. The resulting mixed event is required to satisfy the same selection criteria as applied to \u03b3\u03b3 + dijet data events with a single pp collision. By construction, the mixdp sample provides independent parton scatterings with \u03b3\u03b3 and dijet final states. Because the \u03b3\u03b3 process in a DP event is dominated by small parton momentum fractions (x), the x values in the dijet production process remaining after the first parton interaction occurs are expected to be generally unaffected, i.e. the two interactions have negligible correlation in momentum space. We have verified that the effect of adding the diphoton and dijet components in MIXDP with different vertex positions is negligible, since the MIXDP model is only used for modelling the transverse discriminating variable introduced below in Section V. Two possible event configurations with the \u03b3\u03b3 + dijet final state in a single pp collision are shown in Fig. 3. They can also be used as an illustration of the two DI events if one assumes that the processes shown come from two distinct pp collisions.",

The contribution of the vertex reconstruction efficiency to this quantity is partially absorbed into the acceptance calculation and very close to unity, as we discuss below. To calculate the efficiency for events with 1 pp collision to pass the vertex requirement, we use the \u03b3\u03b3 + dijet data with photon and jet selection criteria. The efficiency for simultaneously satisfying the two-vertex requirement is estimated separately for each jet-vertex assignment configuration, since the vertex efficiency depends on the objects originating from the vertex. For diphoton-dijet events originating from two separate vertices, we calculate \u01eb 2vtx as a product of the efficiency to pass the vertex cuts in the diphoton 2vtx data sample and the efficiency to pass the vertex cuts for dijets in the 2vtx MB sample. Similarly, for events with two jets originating from two separate vertices, we calculate the \u01eb 2vtx efficiency as a product of the efficiency to pass the vertex cuts for the \u03b3\u03b3 + 1 jet 2vtx data sample and the efficiency to pass the vertex cuts for jets in the 2vtx MB sample. The final efficiency is a combination of the two, weighted by the event type fraction. Table VII presents the vertex efficiencies for 1vtx and 2vtx samples and their ratio. We also estimate the probability to lose a hard interaction event because no primary vertex is reconstructed. We find that the fraction of such events in the MB event sample with jet p T > 15 GeV is about 0.1% and about 0.2% for the \u03b3\u03b3+ \u2265 1 jet events in data. Due to the vertex reconstruction algorithm, we may also have an additional reconstructed vertex that passes the vertex requirement. The rate at which this occurs is estimated using \u03b3\u03b3+ \u2265 1 jet events and \u03b3\u03b3+ \u2265 2 jets events simulated in MC without the events from random pp bunch crossings overlaid (there should not be a second vertex in this case).

The values of N c (1) and N c (2) are obtained from a Poisson distribution parametrized with the average number of hard interactions in each bin of the instantaneous luminosity, L inst , distribution, n = (L inst /f cross )\u03c3 hard , where f cross is the frequency of beam crossings for the Tevatron [36]. Summing over all L inst bins, weighted with their fractions, we get R c = (1/2)(N c (1)/N c (2)) = 0.45. Due to higher instantaneous luminosities, this number is smaller by approximately a factor of two compared to that for the data collected earlier as reported in Ref. [22]. Since R c and \u03c3 hard enter Eq. 7 for \u03c3 eff as a product, any increase of \u03c3 hard leads to an increase of n and, as a consequence, to a decrease in R c , and vice versa.
