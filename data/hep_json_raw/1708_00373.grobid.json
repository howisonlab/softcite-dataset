The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09 +0.27   \u22120.26 times the standard model expectation. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV leads to an observed significance of 5.9 standard deviations, equal to the expected significance. This is the first observation of Higgs boson decays to \u03c4 leptons by a single experiment.",

            "text": "In the standard model (SM) of particle physics [1][2][3], electroweak symmetry breaking is achieved via the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism [4][5][6][7][8][9], leading, in its minimal version, to the prediction of the existence of one physical neutral scalar particle, commonly known as the Higgs boson (H). A particle compatible with such a boson was observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC in the ZZ, \u03b3 \u03b3 , and W + W \u2212 decay channels [10][11][12], during the proton-proton (pp) data taking period in 2011 and 2012 at center-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. Subsequent results from both experiments, described in Refs. [13][14][15][16][17][18], established that the measured properties of the new particle, including its spin, CP properties, and coupling strengths to SM particles, are consistent with those expected for the Higgs boson predicted by the SM. The mass of the Higgs boson has been determined to be 125.09 \u00b1 0.21 (stat) \u00b1 0.11 (syst) GeV, from a combination of ATLAS and CMS measurements [19].",

The signal samples with a Higgs boson produced through gluon fusion (ggH), vector boson fusion (VBF), or in association with a W or Z boson (WH or ZH), are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) with the powheg 2.0 [31][32][33][34][35] generator. The minlo hvJ [36] extension of powheg 2.0 is used for the WH and ZH simulated samples. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) is NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 [37]. The ttH process is negligible. The various production cross sections and branching fractions for the SM Higgs boson production, and their corresponding uncertainties are taken from Refs. [38][39][40] and references therein.",

It is based on the clustering of neutral and charged PF candidates within a distance parameter of 0.4. Charged PF candidates not associated with the primary vertex of the interaction are not considered when building jets. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings. The energy of a jet is calibrated based on simulation and data through correction factors [53]. In this analysis, jets are required to have p T greater than 30 GeV and |\u03b7| less than 4.7, and are separated from the selected leptons by a R of at least 0.5. The combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm is used to identify jets that are likely to originate from a b quark (\"b jets\").

In order to correct the yield and distributions of the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , simulations to better reproduce the Drell-Yan process in data, a dedicated control sample of Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events is collected in data with a single-muon trigger, and compared to simulation. The control sample is composed of events with two well-identified and well-isolated opposite-charge muons with p T greater than 25 GeV and an invariant mass between 70 and 110 GeV. More than 99% of events in this region come from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays. Differences in the distributions of m /\u03c4 \u03c4 and p T ( /\u03c4 \u03c4 ) in data and in simulations are observed in this control region, and 2D weights based on these variables are derived and applied to simulated Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , events in the signal region of the analysis. In addition, corrections depending on m jj are derived from the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc region and applied to the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , simulation for events with at least two jets passing the VBF category selection criteria. After this reweighting, good agreement between data in the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc region and simulation is found for all other variables. The simulated sample is split, on the basis of the matching between objects at the generator and (bottom) categories in the \u03bc\u03c4 h decay channel. The background processes are chosen for illustrative purpose for their separation from the signal. The Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc background in the 0-jet category is concentrated in the regions where the visible mass is close to 90 GeV and is negligible when the \u03c4 h candidate is reconstructed in the 3-prong decay mode.

The magnitude of the uncertainty was determined in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events with one \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically and the other one to a muon, by performing maximum likelihood fits for different values of the visible energy scale of genuine \u03c4 h leptons. Among these events, less than half overlap with the events selected in the \u03bc\u03c4 h channel of this analysis. The fit constrains the visible \u03c4 h energy scale uncertainty to about 0.3% for all decay modes. The constraint mostly comes from highly populated regions with a high \u03c4 h purity, namely the 0-jet and boosted categories of the \u03bc\u03c4 h and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channels. The decrease in the size of the uncertainty is explained by the addition of two other decay channels with \u03c4 h candidates (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h and e\u03c4 h ), by the higher number of events in the MC simulations, and by the finer categorization that leads to regions with a high Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 event purity. Even in the most boosted categories, reconstructed \u03c4 h candidates typically have moderate p T (p T less than 100 GeV) and are found in the barrel region of the detector. As tracks are well measured in the CMS detector for this range of p T , the visible energy scale of genuine \u03c4 h leptons is fully correlated for all \u03c4 h leptons reconstructed in the same decay mode, irrespective of their p T and \u03b7.

This uncertainty has been measured in a region enriched in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events with one \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically and the other one decaying to a muon, by comparing the level of agreement in exclusive bins of the reconstructed \u03c4 h decay mode, after adjusting the inclusive normalization of the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 simulation to its best-fit value.

Using m vis and the reconstructed \u03c4 h decay mode as the observables in the 0-jet category of the \u03bc\u03c4 h and e\u03c4 h channels helps reduce the uncertainty after the signal extraction fit: the uncertainty in the rate of muons or electrons misidentified as \u03c4 h becomes of the order of 5%. The energy scale uncertainty for muons or electrons misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates is 1.5 or 3%, respectively, and is uncorrelated between reconstructed \u03c4 h decay modes. The fit constrains these uncertainties to about one third of their initial values. For events where quark-or gluon-initiated jets are misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates, a linear uncertainty that increases by 20% per 100 GeV in \u03c4 h p T accounts for a potential mismodeling of the jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification rate as a function of the \u03c4 h p T in simulations. The uncertainty has been determined from a region enriched in W + jets events, using events with a muon and a \u03c4 h candidate in the final state, characterized by a large transverse mass between the p miss T and the muon [54,55].

The p miss T scale uncertainties arising from unclustered energy deposits in the detector come from four independent sources related to the tracker, ECAL, HCAL, and forward calorimeters subdetectors. Additionally, p miss T scale uncertainties related to the uncertainties in the jet energy scale measurement, which lead to uncertainties in the p miss T calculation, are taken into account. The combination of both sources of uncertainties in the p miss T scale leads to an uncertainty of about 10% in the measured signal strength.",

The extrapolation uncertainty related to kinematic differences in the selections in the signal and control regions ranges between 3 and 10%, depending on the category. In addition, shape uncertainties related to the uncertainties in the applied corrections are considered; they reach 20% for some ranges of m jj in the VBF category. These uncertainties arise from the different level of agreement between data and simulation in the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc control region obtained when varying the threshold on the muon p T . The uncertainty in the QCD multijet background yield in the e\u03bc decay channel ranges from 10 to 20%, depending on the category. It corresponds to the uncertainty in the extrapolation factor from the same-sign to opposite-sign region, measured in events with anti-isolated leptons. In the \u03bc\u03c4 h and e\u03c4 h decay channels, uncertainties from the fit of the control regions with leptons passing relaxed isolation conditions are considered, together with an additional 20% uncertainty that accounts for the extrapolation from the relaxed-isolation control region to the isolated signal region. In the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h decay channel, the uncertainty in the QCD mutlijet background yield is a combination of the uncertainties obtained from fitting the dedicated control regions with \u03c4 h candidates passing relaxed isolation criteria, and of extrapolation uncertainties to the signal region ranging from 3 to 15% and accounting for limited disagreement between prediction and data in signal-free regions with various loose isolation criteria.",

Event categories are designed to target Higgs boson signal events produced by gluon or vector boson fusion. The results are extracted via maximum likelihood fits in two-dimensional planes, and give an observed significance for Higgs boson decays to \u03c4 lepton pairs of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared with an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with the CMS detector leads to the first observation by a single experiment of decays of the Higgs boson to pairs of \u03c4 leptons, with a significance of 5.9 standard deviations.",

Events are selected with at least two (exactly two) jets with p T > 30 GeV in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , \u03bc\u03c4 h , and e\u03c4 h (e\u03bc) channels. In the \u03bc\u03c4 h , e\u03c4 h , and e\u03bc channels, the two leading jets are required to have an invariant mass, m jj , larger than 300 GeV. The variable p \u03c4 \u03c4 T T , is required to be greater than 50 (100) GeV in the \u03bc\u03c4 h and e\u03c4 h (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h ) channels to reduce the contribution from W + jets backgrounds. This selection criterion also suppresses the background from SM events composed uniquely of jets produced through the strong interaction, referred to as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events. In addition, the p T threshold on the \u03c4 h candidate is raised to 40 GeV in the \u03bc\u03c4 h channel, and the two leading jets in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel should be separated in pseudorapidity by \u03b7 > 2.5. The two observables in the VBF category are m \u03c4 \u03c4 and m jj . The 2D distributions for the signal and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 background in the VBF category of the \u03bc\u03c4 h decay channel are shown inFig. 1(center). Integrating over the whole m jj phase space, up to 57% of the signal events in the VBF category are produced in the VBF production mode, but this proportion increases with m jj .",
