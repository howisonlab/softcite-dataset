We find no evidence of this decay and set lower limits on the half-life in the range T 1/2 > (1.1-3.2) \u00d7 10 21 y at the 90% CL, depending on the model used for the kinematic distributions of the emitted electrons. In the standard model (SM) of particle physics, leptons are assigned a lepton number of +1 and anti-leptons are assigned \u22121. All experimental observations thus far are consistent with the assumption that the total lepton number L is conserved in particle interactions [1]. However, since this is not due to a fundamental symmetry, there is no reason to assume that L is generally conserved in theories beyond the SM.",

It could instead be studied using geochemical methods [11].

For each event, the track lengths, calorimeter hit times  and energies, along with their uncertainties, are used to construct two \u03c7 2 values assuming all tracks originate in the foil (internal hypothesis) or one track originates outside the foil and scatters in the foil producing secondary tracks (external). The probabilities of the internal hypothesis must be > 0.1% and of the external hypothesis < 4%. Finally, events with unassociated calorimeter hits with energies > 150 keV in time with the electron candidates are rejected, since this would indicate that photons were emitted in the decay. For the 3e1t topology only, we require that there are no delayed hits with times up to 700 \u00b5s near the decay vertex or the track end points, caused by an \u03b1 decay of the 214 Po daughter of 214 Bi \u03b2 decays [16]. These decays can occur on the surface of the tracker wires with the \u03b2 electron scattering in the foil producing secondaries. The \u03b2 electron in this type of decay would have no associated calorimeter hit.",

We observe two 4e-candidates in the 100 Mo foil, with an expectation of 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 events, of which 2.0\u00b10.4 are due to 2\u03bd2\u03b2 decays followed by double M\u00f8ller scattering.

The expected background yields are given in Tab. II for the energy range 1.2 \u2264 \u03a3E \u2264 2.0 MeV, where \u03a3E is the electron energy sum, obtained by summing over the calorimeter hits for all reconstructed electrons. All activities and systematic uncertainties, except for the 2\u03bd2\u03b2 0 + 1 process, are taken from Ref. [16]. The distributions of the electron energy-sum for events originating from the Nd foil are shown in Fig. 4. The energies of the signal distributions are lower than Q 4\u03b2 = 2.084 MeV due to electron energy losses in the source foil. In addition, only three of the electrons have an associated calorimeter energy measurement for the 3e1t candidate events. The distributions show that there are no large differences between the shapes for the different kinematic models.",

We consider several sources of systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties on the normalization of the background model given in Tab. II are the same as used in Ref. [16], apart from the 25% uncertainty on the halflife of the 2\u03bd2\u03b2 0 + 1 excited state decay [18]. The uncertainties of the signal efficiency are given in Tab. III. The uncertainty on the reconstruction efficiency is determined using the 100 Mo data. It is broken down into two independent components, one based on a two-electron efficiency (\u01eb 2e ) uncertainty of 5.5% and the second on a three-electron (\u01eb 3e ) uncertainty of 8.5%. The first value is obtained by comparing the independently measured activity of a 207 Bi calibration source with the in-situ measurements. This uncertainty can only be determined for decays with a maximum of two electrons in the final state. The three-electron uncertainty (\u01eb 3e ) of 8.5% is obtained by comparing the normalization of the 3e selection in the simulation and data for the 100 Mo foils. This additional uncertainty is applied to both the signal efficiency and background models, and is assumed to be the same size in the 4e and 3e1t topologies. A variation of 2% on the energy scale for all electrons is applied in the simulation to cover uncertainties on the Q 4\u03b2 value, the calorimetric energy reconstruction of 0.2% [15], and uncertainties on the simulated energy loss in the foil. We assume an isotropic angular distribution for the electrons from the 0\u03bd4\u03b2 decay. Since the reconstruction efficiency depends on the electron angles, the effect of a different angular distribution needs to be taken into account. We take this systematic uncertainty to be the variance of the reconstruction efficiency over the entire angular range.",

The combined lower limit at the 90% CL on the 0\u03bd4\u03b2 half-life is 3.2 \u00d7 10 21 y, with a sensitivity, given by the median expected limit, of 3.7\u00d710 21 y, assuming a symmetric energy distribution. The combined limits lie in the range (1.1-3.2) \u00d7 10 21 y for the different models. This result represents the first search for neutrinoless quadruple-\u03b2 decay in any isotope, and the first search for lepton-number violation by 4 units. To improve on this limit in the future using the NEMO-3 technique would not only require more exposure, but also an optimization of the foil density and thickness which causes the main loss of efficiency for low-energy electrons and increases background from M\u00f8ller scattering. Even with reduced isotope mass, a thinner foil should increase sensitivity.",
