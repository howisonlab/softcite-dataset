            "text": "Axions, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics, emerge now as leading candidates of WISP dark matter. The rich phenomenology associated to the light and stable QCD axion can be described as an effective magnetic field that can be experimentally investigated. For the QUAX experiment, dark matter axions are searched by means of their resonant interactions with electronic spins in a magnetized sample. In principle, axion-induced magnetization changes can be detected by embedding a sample in an rf cavity in a static magnetic field. In this work we describe the operation of a prototype ferromagnetic haloscope, with a sensitivity limited by thermal fluctuations and receiver noise. With a preliminary dark matter search, we are able to set an upper limit on the coupling constant of DFSZ axions to electrons g aee < 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 at 95% C.L. for a mass of 58 \u00b5eV (i. e. 14 GHz). This is the first experimental result with an apparatus exploiting the coupling between cosmological axions and electrons.",

            "text": "The axion is a good candidate for DM but was not originally introduced to account for this specific issue. To solve the strong CP problem Peccei and Quinn added a new symmetry to the SM [5], which breaks at an extremely high energy scale F a producing a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the axion [6]. Among the proposed models, the \"invisible axion\" model classes KSVZ and DFSZ still hold [7][8][9][10]. For scales F a \u223c 10 12 GeV, corresponding to typical mass values m a 1 meV, large quantities of axions may have been produced in the early universe and could account even for the totality of cold dark matter [11]. Consequently, several detection schemes have been devised during the last decades to search for relic axions. The value of F a is not fixed by the theory, however, cosmological considerations and astrophysical observations [12][13][14][15][16][17] provide boundaries on F a and suggest a favoured axion mass range 1 \u00b5eV < m a < 10 meV. In addition, lattice results on QCD topological susceptibility, based on reliable computations of the axion relic density, indicate a preferred window for the axion mass in the range of tens of \u00b5eV [18][19][20][21][22][23].",

            "text": "Axion model classes can be tested with different experimental techniques [24][25][26][27][28]. Most of these experiments are based on the Primakoff effect, i.e. an axion to photon conversion in a strong static magnetic field [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. In particular, the ADMX experiment reached the cosmologically relevant sensitivity to exclude the axion mass range 1.9 \u00b5eV m a 3.7 \u00b5eV for the KSVZ model and 2.66 \u00b5eV < m a < 2.81 \u00b5eV for the DFSZ model [37], assuming a local DM density of 0.45 GeV/cm 3 . On the other hand the axionfermion coupling, explicitly predicted in different axion models including DFSZ [38][39][40][41][42], allows for designing new detectors that exploit the interaction between axions and fermionic spins [43][44][45]. Among these, the QUAX detector [46] takes advantage of the resonant interaction between relic axions and a magnetized magnetic sample housed in a microwave cavity. In this paper we present results on the operation of a QUAX demonstrator, based on 5 GaYIG (Gallium Yttrium Iron Garnet) 1 mm diameter spheres placed in a 14 GHz resonant cavity. The apparatus is operated at cryogenic temperatures and its sensitivity is limited only by thermal effects. Section 2 describes the proposed detection scheme, Sects. 3 and 4 report on the measurement of an upper limit on the axion interaction with electronic spins, using the small-scale prototype of the final apparatus. Conclusions are eventually drawn in Sect. 5.",

The two hybrid modes are more sensitive to the power deposited by the axion field since they are not affected by radiation damping, the minimum relaxation time is \u03c4 min = min(\u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u2207a ), where \u03c4 h = 1/k h . With an antenna critically coupled to one of the hybrid resonant modes, the extracted power is P out = P in /2. The scalar product\u03c3 \u2022 \u2207a of Eq. 2shows that the effect is directional. Due to earth rotation, an earth-based experiment experiences a full daily modulation of the signal, due to the variation of the axion wind direction.",

The shape of the cavity is not a regular cylinder, two symmetric sockets are carved into the cylinder to remove the angular degeneration of the normal mode, the maximum and minimum diameters are 26.7 mm and 26.1 mm, and the length is 50.0 mm. The shape of the cavity and of the mode magnetic field are shown in Fig. 3. The choice of the TM110 mode has the advantage of having a uniform maximum magnetic rf field along the cavity axis. Its volume can be increased just using a longer cavity without changing the mode resonance frequency. For this mode we calculate a form factor \u03be = 0.52 [61]. The cavity mode is coupled to a magnetic material, thus we studied the properties of several paramagnetic samples and some ferrites. Highest values of n s together with long relaxation times have been found for YIG (Yttrium Iron Garnet) and GaYIG (Gallium doped YIG). To avoid inhomogeneous broadening of the linewidth due to geometrical demagnetization, these garnets are shaped as highly polished spheres. Five GaYIG spheres of 1 mm diameter have been placed in the maximum magnetic field of the mode, which lies on the axis of the cavity. The spheres are housed inside a PTFE support large enough to let them rotate in all possible directions, in order to automatically align the GaYIG magnetization easy axis with the external magnetic field.",

By gradually increasing T r we linearly change the measured power level of Eq. (6) to determine the noise temperature and gain of the detection electronics, similarly to what is usually obtained with the Y-factor method [62]. In Fig. 5, four collected points are fitted with q(T ) = aT + b to obtain the noise temperature T n = \u2212b/a and the total gain G tot = a. The error of the estimated parameters is less than 1%. Using this method we verified that the noise of the system changes linearly with the temperature, and that the measured cavity output power at the temperature T c is given by Eq. (6) with T r = T c , assuming that IC-1 and 2 have the same losses, which is true within 0.2 dB. Typical measured values are T n = 9 \u00f7 11 K and G tot = 106 \u00f7 108 dB, at different frequencies around 14 GHz. This procedure ensures the accuracy of the measurement and then, using IC-1, we perform measurements on the hybrid system with the calibrated electronic chain. Multiple measurements of the effective axion field have been performed as follows. The vacuum vessel containing the system is cooled down to liquid helium temperature and when a proper thermalization is achieved the detection electronics parameters G tot and T n are measured through IC-2. Then we switch to IC-1, set the magnetic field B 0 to 0.5 T to hybridize the cavity and Kittel mode at f c f L 14 GHz, and critically couple the antenna with the f + hybrid mode using the manipulator. A dedicated DAQ software is used to control the oscillators and the ADC, and verifies the correct positioning of the LO with an automated measurement of Fig. 5 Measurement of noise temperature and gain of the detection electronics. The statistical error for each point is smaller than the size of the symbol. In the plot the mean square amplitude of the ADC output is plotted vs T r .

The results of this preliminary measurements are far from the sensitivity requirements for a cosmological axion search [see Eq. 3], however they can be used to detect DM axion-like particles (ALPs), which can account for the whole dark matter density [64]. During the measurement time the DM-wind amplitude was on the maximum of the daily modulation, allowing us to use the collected data to obtain an upper limit on the ALP-electron coupling at the maximum sensitivity. Through Eq. (10) we are able to exclude values of the ALP-electron coupling constant for ALP masses given by f + through Eq. (3). By repeating the analysis procedure described in Sect. 3.2 for seven measurement runs and averaging together overlapping bandwidths, we produce the plot in Fig. 8.

The present sensitivity to the power deposited in the system by the axion wind maintains an excess photon rate of order 100 photons/s. Short term improvements that will be installed in the prototype include a larger volume of narrow-linewidth magnetic material, namely 10 YIG spheres of 2 mm diameter, a lower cavity temperature with dilution refrigeration and the use of a Josephson Parametric Amplifier (JPA). The increased volume will enhance the axionic signal of a factor 16. As for the noise reduction, a working temperature of 100 mK will reduce the thermal fluctuations and there are hints suggesting that it can also reduce the YIG linewidth. Ultra cryogenic temperatures allow us to use JPAs as first-stage amplifier to drastically increase the sensitivity, since its noise temperature can be of the order of 100 mK.

By using low noise electronics we search for extra power injected in the system that could be due to DM axions. We reach a power sensitivity of 10 \u221222 W that can be translated to an upper limit on the the coupling constant g aee < 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 for an axion mass of 58 \u00b5eV, which, to our knowledge, is the first measurement of the coupling between cosmological axions and electrons. The sensitivity of our apparatus is presently limited only by the noise temperature of the system and thermodynamic fluctuations, as it reaches the limit of Dicke radiometer equation. The overall behavior of the apparatus is as expected, and thus we are confident that the planned upgrades will be effective.",
