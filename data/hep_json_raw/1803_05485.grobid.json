            "text": "precise predictions for all properties of the Higgs boson, given its mass. Within uncertainties, all measured properties of the discovered resonance are consistent with expectations for the SM Higgs boson, corroborating the mechanism for EWSB in the SM. In particular, the discovered particle is known to have zero spin and positive parity [5,6]. Within the present experimental uncertainties, its coupling to fermions is found to be proportional to the fermion mass, as predicted by the SM. In order to confirm that the mechanism for EWSB included in the SM is indeed realized in nature, it is important to perform more precise measurements of the Higgs boson properties. The measurement of the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark, y t , is of high phenomenological interest for several reasons. The extraordinarily large value of the top quark mass, compared to the masses of all other known fermions, may indicate that the top quark plays a still-unknown special role in the EWSB mechanism. The measurement of the rate at which Higgs bosons are produced in association with top quark pairs (ttH production) provides the most precise model-independent determination of y t . An example of a Feynman diagram for ttH production in proton-proton (pp) collisions is shown in figure 1. Since the rate for the gluon fusion Higgs boson production process is dominated by top quark loops, a comparison of y t measured through this production channel and through the ttH production channel will provide powerful constraints on new physics potentially introduced into the gluon fusion process by additional loop contributions.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, are positioned within the solenoid volume. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. Tracks of isolated muons of transverse momentum p T \u2265 100 GeV emitted at |\u03b7| < 1.4 are reconstructed with an efficiency close to 100% and resolutions of 2.8% in p T and 10 (30) \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [19]. The ECAL is a fine-grained hermetic calorimeter with quasi-projective geometry, and is segmented into the barrel region of |\u03b7| < 1.48 and in two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| < 3.0. The HCAL barrel and endcaps similarly cover the region |\u03b7| < 3.0. Forward calorimeters extend the coverage up to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are measured and identified in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A two-level trigger system is used to reduce the rate of recorded events to a level suitable for data acquisition and storage [20]. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz. Details of the CMS detector and its performance, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the kinematic variables used in the analysis, can be found in ref. [21].",

Tracks of electron candidates are reconstructed by a dedicated algorithm which accounts for the emission of bremsstrahlung photons. The energy loss due to bremsstrahlung is determined by searching for energy deposits in the ECAL located tangentially to the track. An MVA approach based on BDTs is employed to distinguish electrons from hadrons mimicking an electron signature. Observables that quantify the quality of the electron track, the compactness of the electron cluster, and the matching between the track momentum and direction with the sum and position of energy deposits in the ECAL are used as inputs to the BDT. This electron identification BDT has been trained on samples of electrons and hadrons. Additional requirements are applied in order to remove electrons originating from photon conversions [50].",

The neutral pions are reconstructed by clustering the photons and electrons reconstructed by the PF algorithm within rectangular strips that are narrow in \u03b7, but wide in the \u03c6 direction, to account for the broadening of energy deposits in the ECAL if one of the photons produced in \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays converts within the tracking detector. An improved version of the strip reconstruction has been developed for data analyses at 13 TeV and beyond, replacing the one used in CMS analyses at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV that was based on a fixed strip size of 0.05 \u00d7 0.20 in \u03b7-\u03c6. In the improved version the size of the strip is adjusted as a function of the p T of the particles reconstructed within the strip [41]. Tight isolation requirements provide the most effective way to distinguish hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays from a large background of light-quark and gluon jets. The sums of scalar p T values of charged particles and of photons are used as inputs to a BDT-based \u03c4 h identification discriminant. Separate sums are used for charged particles that are compatible with originating from the \u03c4 h production vertex and those that are not. The final additions to the list of input variables are the reconstructed \u03c4 h decay mode and observables that provide sensitivity to the lifetime of the \u03c4 lepton. The transverse impact parameter of the highest p T track of the \u03c4 h candidate with respect to the PV is used for \u03c4 h candidates reconstructed in any decay mode. In case of \u03c4 h candidates reconstructed in the decay mode \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 h + h \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 , a fit of the three tracks to a common secondary vertex is attempted and the distance to the PV is used as an additional input variable to the BDT. The isolation is computed within a cone of size R = 0.3, centered on the \u03c4 h direction. Compared to the version of the HPS algorithm used by the majority of CMS analyses with hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays, which use a cone of size R = 0.5, the size of the cone is reduced in this analysis in JHEP08(2018)066 order to improve the efficiency in signal events with high hadronic activity. The BDT has been trained on samples of hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays in ttH signal events and jets in tt+jets background events, produced using MC simulation [41]. Loose, medium, and tight working points (WPs), corresponding respectively to a 65, 55 and 45% \u03c4 h identification efficiency and a 2, 1 and 0.5% jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification rate, are defined by varying the selections on the BDT output. The selections are adjusted as a function of the p T of the \u03c4 h candidate such that the \u03c4 h identification efficiency for each WP is constant as a function of p T . The loose WP is used for the estimation of the background due to the misreconstruction of light-quark or gluon jets as \u03c4 h candidates and is referred to as the \"relaxed \u03c4 h selection\". Contamination from events where the reconstructed \u03c4 h originates from a misreconstructed muon or electron is reduced by requiring the reconstructed \u03c4 h not to overlap with muons or electrons passing loose selection criteria within \u2206R < 0.3.",

The AR used to estimate the contribution of the sign-flip background to the SR contains events passing all selection criteria of the SR, described in section 5, of the respective category, except that the two JHEP08(2018)066 leptons are required to be of opposite sign. In the 2 ss category, the sum of the probabilities to mismeasure the charge of either one of the two leptons is then applied as an event weight. In the 2 ss + 1\u03c4 h category, only the probability to mismeasure the sign of the lepton with the same sign as the \u03c4 h is used, due to the charge requirements used for the event selection in this category.

The mapping is determined as follows. The algorithm starts by filling two-dimensional histograms of the output of the first versus the second BDT for signal and background events. The histograms use a fine binning. The distributions for signal and for background are smoothed using Gaussian kernels to reduce statistical fluctuations. The ratio of signal to background event yields is computed in each bin and assigned to background events depending on the bins they fall in. The cumulative distribution of this ratio is produced for background events and partitioned, based on its quantiles, into N regions of equal background content. The number of regions is chosen using a recursive application of the k-means clustering algorithm with k = 2 [58] on the two-dimensional distribution of the BDTs, including stopping conditions limiting the statistical uncertainty in the signal and background templates. The output of the algorithm that determines the mapping is a partitioning of the two-dimensional plane spanned by the output of the two BDTs into N regions and an enumeration, used as a discriminant, of these regions by increasing signal-to-background ratio. By construction, the distribution of the background is approximately flat in this discriminant, while the distribution of the signal increases from low to high values of the discriminant. In the 2 ss and 3 categories, the signal extraction is performed using this JHEP08(2018)066 discriminant in subcategories based on lepton flavor, lepton charges and b-tagging requirements. In the 3 + 1\u03c4 h category, due to limited statistics in simulation, the training of the two BDTs and the two-dimensional mapping have been actually performed with an inclusive 3 selection, resulting in a non flat background distribution.",

The effect on the normalization ranges from 10 to 40%, depending on the multiplicity of misidentified electrons, muons, and \u03c4 h , and on their p T and \u03b7. The uncertainties in the normalization include the effect of statistical uncertainties in the sample used to measure the f i , of JHEP08(2018)066 systematic uncertainties related to the subtraction of the prompt-lepton contamination in this sample, and of the non-perfect agreement in simulation between distributions for misidentified lepton background and those obtained when applying the FF method. The effect on distributions in kinematic observables is computed as follows. In case of electrons and muons, an uncertainty band for the distributions used for signal extraction is obtained by applying independent variations of the f i in different bins of p T and \u03b7. In case of \u03c4 h , we fit the misidentification rates f i measured in the barrel and endcap region of the detector as function of p T and propagate the uncertainty in the slope of the fit to the final result, in a correlated way between all the categories with \u03c4 h candidates, with typical values around 3%.",

The lowest bin of the MEM discriminant in the \"missing-jet\" subcategory of the 2 ss + 1\u03c4 h category collects events for which the kinematics of the reconstructed objects is not compatible with the ttH, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal hypothesis.  Table 6. The 95% CL upper limits on the ttH signal rate, in units of the SM ttH production rate, obtained in each of the categories individually and for the combination of all six event categories. The observed limit is compared to the limits expected for the background-only hypothesis (\u00b5 = 0) and for the case that a ttH signal of SM production rate is present in the data (\u00b5 = 1). The \u00b11 standard deviation uncertainty intervals on the expected limits are also given in the table.  modes by H \u2192 VV and performing a two-parameter simultaneous fit for the signal rates \u00b5(ttH, H \u2192 VV) and \u00b5(ttH, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ), we obtain \u00b5(ttH, H \u2192 VV) = 1.69 +0.68 \u22120.61 and \u00b5(ttH, H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) = 0.15 +1.07 \u22120.91 . The expected anti-correlation between the two measured signal strengths has been explicitly checked and is associated with a correlation factor of \u22120.45.",

The square of the ME, |M \u2126 (x)| 2 , is computed at LO using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo program. The symbols f i (x a , Q) and f j (x b , Q) denote the PDFs, which we evaluate numerically using the CTEQ6.6 [73] and NNPDF3.0 LO sets. The four-dimensional \u03b4-function \u03b4 4 (x a P a + x b P b \u2212 p k ) ensures the conservation of energy and momentum. The integral on the right-hand side is first transformed analytically, in order to eliminate the \u03b4-function and to make the computation of the integral numerically tractable, and then computed numerically using the VEGAS algorithm [74]. A complication arises from the fact that we use LO ME for the ttH signal and for background processes. The LO ME strictly applies only to events in which no additional jets, besides the jets corresponding to quarks in the LO ME, are produced in the hard scattering interaction. At the center-ofmass energies of the LHC the phase space for quantum chromodynamics radiation is large, however, and particles with masses up to a few hundred GeV are typically produced in association with a sizable hadronic activity [75]. In order to use the LO ME, we transform the system of all particles that are present in the LO ME into a frame in which this system has zero p T . In the opposite case of events where the reconstructed jet multiplicity is lower than the number of quarks present in the LO ME the integral on the right-hand-side of eq. (A.1) is extended by an integration over the variables associated to the missing jets. The TFs W (y|x) are obtained from the MC simulation and are used to model the p T resolution of jets and the resolution on p miss",
