Furthermore, the charmless multibody decays of b baryons contain rich resonance structures, both in the low-mass two-body baryon resonances (i.e. the pK \u2212 , p\u03c0 \u2212 and p\u03c0 + invariant mass spectra) and in the two-body nonbaryonic resonances (i.e. the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and K + K \u2212 invariant mass spectra).

The LHCb detector [7,8] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

Finally, PID requirements are applied to provide discrimination between kaons and pions in order to assign the candidates to one of the five different final-state spectra p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , pK \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , pK \u2212 \u03c0 + K \u2212 and pK \u2212 K + K \u2212 . There are three main categories of background that contribute significantly in the selected invariant mass regions: the so-called signal \"cross-feed\" backgrounds resulting from a misidentification of one or more final-state particles; the charmless decays of neutral B mesons to final states containing four charged mesons, where a pion or a kaon is misidentified as a proton; and the combinatorial backgrounds, which result from a random association of unrelated tracks. The pion and kaon PID requirements that define mutually exclusive samples are optimised to reduce the signal cross-feed background, and hence to maximize the observation of the signal. The charmless B-meson decays are identified by reconstructing the invariant mass distributions of candidates reconstructed with a pion or kaon mass instead of the proton mass hypothesis, in the data high-mass sidebands, defined as m sideband < m(phhh) < 6400 MeV/c 2 , where m sideband = 5680 MeV/c 2 for p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , pK \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 final states and m sideband = 5840 MeV/c 2 for pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , pK \u2212 \u03c0 + K \u2212 , pK \u2212 K + K \u2212 final states.
