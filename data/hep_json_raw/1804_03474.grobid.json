Due to the fact that the investigation of QCD in small systems at high multiplicity is becoming an increasingly large subject, interesting the heavy-ion community and more in general the high-energy physics community, not all the related topics can be discussed in this paper. The focus will be given to some of the measurements addressing the physics of collective phenomena in small systems and to the recent results on strangeness enhancement in proton-proton collisions. The reader must be informed that a large number of interesting results did not find space in the discussion reported here.",

As a matter of fact, results based on the analysis of particle production in small systems provided the evidence that the characteristic phenomena observed in heavy-ion collisions, most notably the high-p T and jet suppression [4,5], were actually due to the formation of a hot state of QCD matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma.",

The discovery of the \"ridge\" in pp collisions by the CMS Collaboration was the first of a long list of such results [6]. Long-range, near-side angular correlations in particle production emerged in pp and subsequently in p-Pb collisions [7] and paved the way for a systematic investigation of the existence of collective phenomena, known since long in heavy-ion collisions [8], in the much smaller pp and p-Pb collision systems. A wealth of new, unexpected phenomena have been observed so far with striking similarities to heavy-ion phenomenolgy. In this report, only a few of them can be discussed because of the lack of space. The focus will be given to a selection of recent LHC results aiming at studying collective phenomena and the chemistry of hadron production in small systems.",

If collective radial flow develops, this would result in a characteristic dependence of the shape of the transverse momentum distribution on the particle mass. The p T distributions in pp and p-Pb collisions show a clear evolution, becoming harder as the multiplicity increases, with a change which is most pronounced for protons and lambdas. The stronger multiplicity dependence of the spectral shapes of heavier particles is evident when looking at the p T -dependent ratios, such as the \u039b/K 0 S ratio measured by the CMS Collaboration [21], shown in  modification of the p T -depentent ratios of p/\u03c0 and of \u039b/K 0 S follows a rather smooth evolution at low and mid p T across different systems, pointing towards a universal soft mechanism driven by final state dN ch /d\u03b7 [23]. The high-p T part of the ratio, which is dominated by hard fragmentation, is unchanged.",

A simultaneous fit to pions, kaons and protons is performed by the ALICE Collaboration following the approach discussed in [23]. The best fit describes the data with good accurancy in the low-p T domain, stressing the consistency of particle production from a thermal source expanding with a common transverse velocity. The results of the fit to pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb data are shown in Figure 5 as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7. In the context of the Blast-Wave model, when comparing the parameters of different systems at similar dN ch /d\u03b7, T kin values are similar, whereas \u03b2 T is larger for small systems. This might be an indication of a larger radial flow in small systems as consequence of stronger pressure gradients. The ALICE results also show that both T kin and \u03b2 T parameters obtained from pp and p-Pb fits are consistent for similar dN ch /d\u03b7. One has to acknowledge  that a different conclusion emerges from similar fits reported by CMS [21], where pp collisions appear as more explosive than p-Pb collisions, with a larger \u03b2 T for similar dN ch /d\u03b7.",

Unlike up (u) and down (d) quarks, which form ordinary matter, strange (s) quarks are not present as valence quarks in the initial state. Yet they are sufficiently light to be abundantly created by non-perturbative (soft) processes in the course of the collisions. String fragmentation, as an example of non-perturbative QCD process, dominates the production of strange hadrons at low p T . As a matter of fact, given that the mass of the strange quark is larger than the one of up and down quarks, production of strange hadrons in fragmentation is suppressed relative to hadrons containing only light quarks.",

Similar measurements have been previously performed by ALICE p-Pb collisions [23,25] and in Pb-Pb collisions [26,39]. Figure 6 shows the measured ratios of the p T -integrated yields of K 0 S , \u039b, \u039e and \u2126 to the pion yield as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 in pp collisions [24] compared to p-Pb and Pb-Pb results at the LHC [23,25,26]. A significant enhancement of strange to non-strange hadron production is observed with increasing charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions. The behaviour observed in pp collisions resembles that of p-Pb collisions at a slightly lower centre-of-mass energy [25], both in the values of the ratios and in their evolution with dN ch /d\u03b7, suggesting that strangeness production is driven by the event activity of the event rather than by the initial-state collision system or energy. Figure 7 shows that the p T -integrated yield ratios \u039b/K 0 S and p/\u03c0 do not change significantly with multiplicity, demonstrating that the observed enhanced production rates of strange hadrons with respect to pions is not due to the difference in the hadron masses.",

            "text": "The authors in [45] have studied the multiplicity dependence of light flavour hadron production at LHC energies in the strangeness canonical suppression picture using THER-MUS [52]. The details can be found therein. As can be observed from Figure 8, the study shows that the model provides a good description of the experimental data, except for the \u03c6 meson. As a matter of fact, the strangeness canonical suppression model is only sensitive to the strangeness quantum number of the hadron. The observation of an enhancement (suppression) of \u03c6 meson production with increasing (decreasing) multiplicity clearly signals that the particle production rate is not consistent with the one expected from a hadron with zero strangeness quantum number. This can be observed also in Figure 9, which shows the ratio of \u03c6/K and \u039e/\u03c6 as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7. It is evident that \u03c6 meson (S = 0) production increases faster than K meson (S = 1) production. When compared to the \u039e, the \u039e/\u03c6 is constant within uncertainties for dN ch /d\u03b7 > 10. This is an indication that the \u03c6 meson behaviour is closer to the behaviour expected from a hadron formed by two strange quarks. The increase of the relative \u03c6 meson production with dN ch /d\u03b7 constitues a notable crack in the canonical suppression interpretation of the observed strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions.",
