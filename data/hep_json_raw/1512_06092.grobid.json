This Letter presents a measurement of the charge asymmetry in events where the top-quark pair is produced with a large invariant mass. The analysis is performed on 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, using reconstruction techniques specifically designed for the decay topology of highly boosted top quarks. The charge asymmetry in a fiducial region with large invariant mass of the top-quark pair (m tt > 0.75 TeV) and an absolute rapidity difference of the top and anti-top quark candidates within \u22122 < |y t | \u2212 |y\u00aft | < 2 is measured to be 4.2 \u00b1 3.2%, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading order. A differential measurement in three tt mass bins is also presented.",

In the Standard Model (SM), a forward-backward asymmetry ( A FB ), of order \u03b1 s , is expected at a proton-antiproton (pp) collider such as the Tevatron, with a much enhanced asymmetry in certain kinematical regions. Early measurements [3,4] found a larger A FB than predicted by the SM. Later determinations confirmed this deviation and measurements in intervals of the invariant mass, m tt , of the system formed by the top-quark pair [5-9] found a stronger dependence on m tt than anticipated. Recent calculations of electroweak effects [10] and the full next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) corrections [11] to the asymmetry have brought the difference between the observed asymmetry at the Tevatron and the SM prediction down to the 1.5 \u03c3 level and reduced the tension with the differential measurements in m tt [12,13].",

The analysis focuses on the lepton + jets ( + jets) final state, where the hadronic top-quark decay is reconstructed as a single large-radius (large-R) jet and tagged as such using jet substructure variables. The leptonic topquark decay is reconstructed from a single small-radius (small-R) jet, a single charged lepton (muon or electron), and missing transverse momentum, corresponding to the neutrino from the W boson decay. The event selection and reconstruction follow the prescriptions of Ref. [27], where a detailed description and discussion of their performance can be found.",

The contribution from events with leptons passing only the non-isolated triggers but having p T below these higher thresholds is negligible.

The selection and reconstruction schemes yield good efficiency and tt mass determination for high-mass pairs. Detailed MC studies presented in Ref.

A dilution factor D = 1 indicates perfect charge assignment. The MC simulation predicts a value of approximately D = 0.75 for the selected sample.
