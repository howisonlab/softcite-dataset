One of the main objectives of the LHC is to search for new physics beyond the SM either through direct detection or through interference effects in b-and c-hadron decays. In the SM, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [2] governs the strength of weak charged-current interactions and their corresponding phases. Precise measurements on the CKM matrix parameters may reveal deviations from the consistency that is expected in the SM, making study of these decays a unique laboratory in which to search for physics beyond the standard model.",

For these measurements, the most important parts of LHCb are the vertex detector (VELO), the charged particle tracking system, the ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors and the trigger. The VELO is instrumental in separating particles coming from heavy quark decays and those emerging directly from pp interactions, by providing an impact parameter (IP) resolution of about 16 m \u00fe 30 m=p T (transverse momentum, p T in GeV=c). The tracking system measures charged particles' momenta with a resolution of p =p $ 0:4%\u00f00:6%\u00de at 5 (100) GeV=c. The RICH detectors are important to identify kaons and suppress the potentially large backgrounds from misidentified pions. Events are selected by a two-level trigger system. The first level is hardware based, and requires either a large transverse energy deposition in the calorimeter system, or a high p T muon or pair of muons detected in the muon system. The second level, the high-level trigger, uses simplified versions of the offline software to reconstruct decays of b and c hadrons both inclusively and exclusively. Candidates passing the trigger selections are saved and used for offline analysis. A more detailed description of the LHCb detector can be found elsewhere [11].",

In particular, we exploit the fact that b hadrons are produced in pairs in pp collisions, and include events that were triggered by the decay products of either the signal b hadron or the other b hadron in the event. This requirement increases the efficiency of our trigger selection by about 80% compared to the trigger selections requiring the signal b hadron to be responsible for triggering the event, as was done in Ref. [12]. This sizeable increase in the trigger efficiency is due to the large average p T of the reconstructed signal B decay and the kinematic correlation (in p T and pseudorapidity) between the two b hadrons in the event.",

The Cabibbo suppression results in about a factor of 20 lower rate. To improve the signal-tobackground ratio in the CS decay modes, additional selection requirements are imposed, and they are applied to both the signal and normalization modes. The B meson candidate is required to have p T > 4 GeV=c, IP < 60 m with respect to its associated primary vertex (PV), where the associated PV is the one having the smallest impact parameter 2 with respect to the track. We also require the flight distance 2 > 144, where the 2 is with respect to the zero flight distance hypothesis, and the vertex 2 =ndf < 5, where ndf represents the number of degrees of freedom in the fit. The last requirement is also applied to the vertices associated with X d and X s . Three additional criteria are applied only to the CS modes. First, to remove the peaking backgrounds from B ! DD \u00c0 s , D \u00c0 s ! K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 , we veto events where the invariant mass, M\u00f0X s \u00de, is within 20 MeV=c 2 ($ 2:5) of the D s mass. Information from the RICH detectors is critical to reduce background from the CF decay modes. This suppression is accomplished by requiring the kaon in X s to have p < 100 GeV=c (above which there is minimal K= separation from the RICH detectors), and the difference in loglikelihoods between the kaon and pion hypotheses to satisfy \u00c1 lnL\u00f0K \u00c0 \u00de > 8.

The uncertainties in the CS signal fits are obtained by varying each of the signal shape parameters within the uncertainty obtained from the CF mode data fits. The signal shape parameter uncertainties are 2.7% for \" B 0 and 2.5% for B \u00c0 . For the specific b-hadron background shapes, we obtain the uncertainty by refitting the data 100 times, where each fit is performed with all background shapes fluctuated within their covariances and subsequently fixed in the fit to the data (1%). The uncertainties in the yields from the assumed exponential shape for the combinatorial background are estimated by taking the difference in yields between the nominal fit and one with a linear shape for the combinatorial background (2%). In total, the relative yields are uncertain by 4.5% for \" B 0 and 4.4% for B \u00c0 . The limited number of MC events for determining the relative efficiencies contributes 4.1% and 3.8% to the \" B 0 and B \u00c0 branching fraction ratio uncertainties, respectively. Other sources of uncertainty are negligible. In total, the uncertainties on the ratio of branching fractions are 8.6% for \" B 0 and 9.3% for B \u00c0 . We have also looked at the substructures that contribute to the CS final states. Because the B \u00c0 ! D 0 K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 intermediate resonances are relevant to the measurement, we focus on this decay.

We show events in the B mass signal region, defined to have an invariant mass from 5226-5326 MeV=c 2 , and events from the high-mass sideband (5350-5550 MeV=c 2 ), scaled by the ratio of expected background yields in the signal region relative to the sideband region. An excess of events is observed predominantly in the low K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 mass region near 1300-1400 MeV=c 2 , and the number of signal events decreases with increasing mass. In Fig. 2(b) there appears to be an excess of $10 events in the region around 550-600 MeV=c 2 , which suggests contributions from D 1 \u00f02420\u00de 0 or D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de 0 meson decays. These decays can also be used for measuring the weak phase [18]. This yield, relative to the total, is similar to what was observed PRL 108, 161801 (2012) [12].
