The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (|\u03b7| < 0.8) over the transverse momentum range 0.15 < p T < 10 GeV/c. The correlation between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity is also studied. Results are presented for inelastic (INEL) and non-single-diffractive (NSD) events. The average transverse momentum for |\u03b7| < 0.8 is p T INEL = 0.483 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007 (syst.) GeV/c and p T NSD = 0.489 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007 (syst.) GeV/c, respectively. The data exhibit a slightly larger p T than measurements in wider pseudorapidity intervals. The results are compared to simulations with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA and PHOJET.",

            "text": "The precise measurement of the transverse momentum spectrum of charged particles produced in proton collisions in the energy range of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] offers unique information about soft and hard interactions. Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) is a framework for the quantitative description of parton-parton interactions at large momentum transfers, i.e. hard scattering processes. However, a significant fraction of the particles produced in pp collisions do not originate from hard interactions, even at LHC energies. In contrast to hard processes, the description of particle production in soft interactions is not well-established within QCD. Current models of hadron-hadron collisions at high energies, such as the event generators PYTHIA [2] and PHOJET [3], combine perturbative QCD for the description of hard parton interactions with phenomenological approaches to model the soft component of the produced particle spectrum. Data on charged particle production in hadronhadron collisions will have to be used to tune these models before they can provide a detailed description of the existing measurements and predictions for particle production characteristics in pp collisions at the highest LHC energies. These data include the measurement of multiplicity, pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and transverse momentum (p T ) distributions of charged particles and correlations, such as the dependence of the average transverse momentum, p T , on the charged particle multiplicity.",

In this letter, we present a measurement in pp collisions at \u221a s = 900 GeV of the transverse momentum spectrum of primary charged particles and the correlation between p T and the charged particle multiplicity. Primary particles include particles produced in the collision or their decay products, except those from weak decays of strange hadrons. The measurement is performed in the central rapidity region (|\u03b7| < 0.8) and covers a p T range 0.15 < p T < 10 GeV/c, where both hard and soft processes are expected to contribute to particle production. The data from the ALICE experiment presented in this letter serve as a baseline for future studies of pp collisions at higher LHC energies and particle production in heavy-ion collisions [7].",

These filters also perform tail cancellation and baseline restoration. They are optimized for precise position and dE/dx measurements in the high track density environment of heavy-ion collisions. To ensure optimal drift and charge transport properties, the TPC was operated with an overall temperature uniformity of \u2206T \u2248 60 mK (r.m.s.). The oxygen contamination was less than 5 ppm.",

A track is accepted if it has at least 70 out of the maximum of 159 space points in the TPC, and the \u03c7 2 per space point used for the momentum fit is less than 4. Additionally, at least two hits in the ITS must be associated with the track, and at least one has to be in either of the two innermost layers, i.e., in the SPD. The average number of associated hits per track in the six ITS layers is 4.7, mainly determined by the fraction of inactive channels, and is well reproduced in Monte Carlo simulations.

The procedure estimates losses due to tracking inefficiency, charged particles escaping detection due to weak decay, absorption and secondary interaction in the detec-tor. The inefficiencies of the event selection and of the event vertex reconstruction are accounted for. The latter two affect mostly low-multiplicity events, which imposes a bias on the uncorrected p T spectrum due to the correlation between multiplicity and average momentum. The primary charged particle track reconstruction efficiency in the region |\u03b7| < 0.8 reaches 75% at p T \u223c 1 GeV/c, as shown in Fig. 1. The slight decrease of efficiency observed for p T > 1.5 GeV/c is a consequence of the projective segmentation of the readout plane in azimuth, causing stiff tracks to remain undetected if they fall between two adjacent TPC readout sectors. For p T < 0.6 GeV/c, the reconstruction efficiency decreases and reaches 50% at 0.15 GeV/c. The losses at low p T are mainly due to energy loss in the detector material and to the track bending in the magnetic field. No significant dependence of the track reconstruction efficiency on the track density is observed in simulations for charged particle multiplicities relevant for this analysis. The contamination from secondary particles such as charged particles from weak decays, electrons from photon conversions, and products from secondary interactions in the detector material is also shown in Fig. 1. It has a maximum of 9% at the lowest p T and drops below 3% for p T > 1 GeV/c. A comparison of the d 0 distributions of data and Monte Carlo tracks indicates that the Monte Carlo simulation using PYTHIA underestimates the particle yield from secondaries by 0-50%, depending on p T . This is consistent with the fact that PYTHIA underestimates the strangeness yield by a similar amount, when compared to previous results in pp and pp collisions [14,15]. For the final corrections to the data we scale accordingly the contamination level obtained with PYTHIA, resulting in an additional 0-1.5% decrease of the primary particle yields. The uncertainty in the strangeness yield is taken into account in the evaluation of the overall systematic uncertainties, as discussed below.",

The modified Hagedorn fit provides a good description of the data for p T < 4 GeV/c. The fit parameters for INEL events are p T,0 = 1.05 \u00b1 0.01 (stat.)\u00b10.05 (syst.) GeV/c and b = 7.92 \u00b1 0.03 (stat.)\u00b10.02 (syst.). The average transverse momentum including the extrapolation to p T = 0 is p T INEL = 0.483 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007(syst.) GeV/c. For NSD events we obtain p T,0 = 1.05 \u00b1 0.01 (stat.)\u00b10.05 (syst.) GeV/c, b = 7.84 \u00b1 0.03 (stat.)\u00b10.02 (syst.) and p T NSD = 0.489 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007 (syst.) GeV/c. Restriction of the modified Hagedorn fit to p T < 4 GeV/c has a negligible effect on these results. Fig. 2 also shows the result of a power law fit (Eq. 2) to the INEL data for p T > 3 GeV/c. The power law fit provides a significantly better description of the high p T tail of the spectrum than the modified Hagedorn parametrization. The result of the power law fit is n = 6.63 \u00b1 0.12 (stat.) \u00b10.01 (syst.) for both INEL and NSD events. The power law shape of the high p T part of the spectrum is suggestive of pQCD. Estimates of differential cross sections can be obtained using the cross sections derived from the measurement by UA5 [13] in pp at \u221a s = 900 GeV, \u03c3 INEL = 50.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b11 (syst.) mb and \u03c3 NSD = 42.6\u00b11.4 mb (see also [18]).",

Our results are somewhat higher than previous measurements in pp and pp at the same energy, but in larger pseudorapidity windows. This is consistent with the comparison of the spectra in Fig. 3. A similar trend exhibiting a larger p T in a smaller pseudorapidity interval around mid-rapidity is apparent in Fig. 4 at Tevatron energies.  Indeed, a decrease of p T by about 2% is found between |\u03b7| < 0.2 and 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 0.8 in a pseudorapidity dependent analysis of the present data. A consis-tent decrease of p T is also observed in the CMS data, when pseudorapidity is increased [20,26]. Likewise, a decrease of p T by about 5% between |\u03b7| < 0.8 and |\u03b7| < 2.5 is found at \u221a s = 900 GeV in PYTHIA. Charged particle transverse momentum distributions can be used to tune Monte Carlo event generators of hadron-hadron interactions, such as PYTHIA and PHOJET. Recently, PYTHIA was tuned to describe the energy dependence of existing measurements, e.g. with respect to the treatment of multiple parton interactions and divergencies of the 2\u21922 parton scattering cross-section at small momentum transfers.

The results for the fit parameters in bins of n acc are listed in Table 2, along with the average multiplicity n ch assigned to each n acc as determined from Monte Carlo simulations. Also shown in Fig. 6 are ratios of p T spectra in different multiplicity regions over the inclusive p T spectrum in INEL events. A very pronounced multiplicity dependence of the spectral shape is manifest, exhibiting enhanced particle production at high p T in high multiplicity events. At p T < 0.8 GeV/c the trend is opposite, albeit with a much weaker multiplicity dependence. The evolution of the spectral shape with multiplicity may shed light on different particle production mechanisms in pp collisions. A qualitatively similar evolution of the p T spectra with multiplicity has been seen in pp data at \u221a s = 200 GeV [29]. The average transverse momentum p T as a function of the multiplicity of accepted particles (n acc ) in INEL pp collisions at \u221a s = 900 GeV is shown in the left panel of Fig. 7. For all three selected p T ranges a significant increase of p T with multiplicity is observed. Most significantly for 0.5 < p T < 4 GeV/c, the slope changes at intermediate multiplicities.",

            "text": "A measurement is presented of the primary charged particle transverse momentum spectrum and of the mean transverse momentum in pp collisions at \u221a s = 900 GeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. Good agreement with previous results from LHC is found up to p T = 1 GeV/c. At higher p T , the data exhibit a harder momentum spectrum of primary charged particles than other measurements in pp and pp collisions at the same energy. We argue that this is most likely related to the different pseudorapidity intervals studied. The average transverse momentum in |\u03b7| < 0.8 is p T INEL = 0.483\u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007 (syst.) GeV/c and p T NSD = 0.489 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b10.007 (syst.) GeV/c. None of the models and tunes investigated simultaneously describes the p T spectrum and the correlation between p T and n ch . In particular in the low p T region, where the bulk of the particles are produced, the models require further tuning. These measurements will help to improve the phenomenological description of soft QCD processes and the interplay between soft and hard QCD. The presented data demonstrate the excellent performance of the ALICE detector for momentum measurement and will be used as a baseline for measurements at higher  The error bars and the shaded area indicate the statistical and systematic errors of the data, respectively.
