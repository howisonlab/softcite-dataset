Unlike in scintillator, production yields for cosmogenic backgrounds in water have not been exclusively measured before, yet they are becoming more and more important in next generation neutrino experiments designed to search for rare signals. We have analyzed the low-energy trigger data collected at Super-Kamiokande-IV in order to determine the production rates of 12 B, 12 N, 16 N, 11 Be, 9 Li, 8 He, 9 C, 8 Li, 8 B and 15 C. These rates were extracted from fits to time differences between parent muons and subsequent daughter \u03b2's by fixing the known isotope lifetimes. Since 9 Li can fake an inverse-beta-decay reaction chain via a \u03b2 + n cascade decay, producing an irreducible background with detected energy up to a dozen MeV, a dedicated study is needed for evaluating its impact on future measurements; the application of a neutron tagging technique using correlated triggers was found to improve this 9 Li measurement. The measured yields were generally found to be comparable with theoretical calculations, except the cases of the isotopes 8 Li/ 8 B and 9 Li.",

Although the production yields for spallation backgrounds have been extensively measured in liquid scintillator experiments [1][2][3], there has been a lack of measurements of these isotopes produced in water. In this case, it is understood that cosmic-ray muons and their subsequent showers interact with 16 O nuclei to produce isotopes, which usually have a lifetime up to tens of seconds and can undergo a cascade decay with \u03b2 energy ranging from a few MeV to a dozen MeV. For neutrino interactions in this energy range, these events can form a background in planned next-generation water Cherenkov detectors [4][5][6][7][8], which are designed for detecting signals such as solar neutrino-electron elastic scattering or inverse beta decay (IBD;\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n) of anti-neutrinos from reactors or core-collapse supernovae.",

However, many longlived isotopes still survived and affected the search for a low-energy upturn of the solar 8 B neutrino spectrum as well as the hunt for evidence of supernova relic neutrinos (SRNs), also known as diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), emitted from past core-collapse supernovae. Recently, theoretical progress has been made in the calculation of the production and properties of these backgrounds in water, shedding light on practical improvements in spallation background rejection [13][14][15]. Providing experimental data should help improve knowledge in this area.",

The SRN search is particularly vulnerable to the spallation background since its expected signal event rate is quite low. We find that of the potential spallation isotopes only the decay of 9 Li can have a significant contribution through the \u03b2 energy tail to the \"golden\" SRN search window of 9.5\u221229.5 MeV in positron kinetic energy, in which the contribution from both reactor neutrino and atmospheric neutrino backgrounds is relatively small. Theoretically, the 9 Li isotope is known to be not directly produced by the primary muon, but rather by the secondary \u03c0 \u2212 interacting with the 16 O nucleus: \u03c0 \u2212 + 16 O \u2192 \u03b1 + 2p + n + 9 Li, where 9 Li has a lifetime of 0.26 s and decays into \u03b2 + n with a probability of (50.8 \u00b1 0.9)% [16]. This feature can be exploited to separate the 9 Li candidates from other isotope events and give a better measurement on the corresponding yield, if the delayed neutrons are tagged as was done in the SK-IV SRN search [17].",

In the summer of 2008, a new electronics and online system was successfully installed to enhance the data-processing capability of SK [19]. The running period after that time is referred to as SK-IV, during which the trigger threshold for low-energy events was consequently lowered to 3.5 MeV. Physics analyses for solar neutrinos and other low energy phenomena are performed with this trigger. In addition, the new online system allowed the introduction of a correlated trigger scheme. Low-energy events with a threshold over 9.5 MeV (reduced to 7.5 MeV after the summer of 2011) were followed by a forced trigger 500 \u00b5s long to record all the PMT hits, including those fired by the subtle 2.2 MeV \u03b3 emitted from a neutron capture on hydrogen (n + p \u2192 d + \u03b3). Due to the readout configuration of the new online system, data for normal triggers were taken for 40 \u00b5s ranging from -5 to 35 \u00b5s with respect to the time when the triggers were issued. Therefore, delayed 2.2 MeV \u03b3 signals can be searched for up to 535 \u00b5s after the primary event time. This study used data collected from October 2008 to October 2014.",

            "text": "The reconstruction of cosmic-ray muons is of critical importance in both tagging spallation backgrounds and selecting cosmic \u00b5-e decays. Muon candidates are required to have both an ID and an OD trigger. In addition, the number of photo-electrons (p.e.s) collected should be greater than 1,000 (\u223c140 MeV) in the ID. In this study, we only analyzed muons within \u00b130 seconds around the low-energy events. These muon candidates were reconstructed with a dedicated muon fitter. Details about the algorithm of the muon fitter can be found elsewhere [20,21]. The muon fitter categorized the cosmic ray muons into four classes (I) Single through-going muons: those with a track The remaining 0.3% of the muon events were not identified by the muon fitting algorithm due to an insufficient number of PMT hits after the selection cuts. These events were referred to as non-fitted muons. In addition, we observed that 1.2% of the muons among the four classes had a poor quality of fit and were thus classified as poorly-fitted muons. The non-fitted and poorly-fitted muons were still used in the studies of the time distributions even though the transverse distance cut defined in the following section could not be applied, since the entrance position for cosmic-ray muon was not determined by the muon fitter. Here we only used the most probable track information for multiple muons in the analysis. Fig. 1 shows the path-length distribution for each muon category. The distributions reflect the effects due to the geometry of the detector and the zenith angle distribution of the cosmic-ray muons. The peaks around 36 m are from muons traveling vertically downward through the detector. The muon rate R \u00b5 and the average path length for muons L \u00b5 were found to be R \u00b5 = 2.00 \u00b1 0.01 Hz and L \u00b5 = 2, 200 \u00b1 4 cm, respectively.",

This cut was re-investigated for spallation events. In this analysis, a correlated muon event was defined as a muon recorded less than 30 s prior to a low-energy event, while an uncorrelated muon event was defined as a muon recorded less than 30 s after a low-energy event. The muon along with the low-energy events corresponding to the correlated and uncorrelated muon classes comprise the spallation and non-spallation samples, respectively. The absolute time difference dt was calculated from the muon time and the low-energy-event time. Under these definitions, we statistically obtained the distributions for the spallation signal events from a subtraction of the non-spallation sample from that of the spallation sample. This helped us to have a better understanding to the mechanism of muon spallation. Fig. 2 shows the subtracted distributions of dt and lt for all the muon categories except for the corner clipping muons. We normalized the distributions to unity in order to give a shape comparison. Since the isotopes produced by corner-clipping muons either were removed by data reduction or escaped from the ID, the dt and lt distributions for these muons were dominated by the non-spallation muons. The dt distributions are similar for each fitted muon class, and so we conclude that there is no correlation between the type of muon and the resulting spallation isotope. However, we observed that the lt distribution for multiple muons was broader than the others. This was understood to be due to the choice of evaluating lt from the most probable track out of several parallel muon tracks in each bundle. Consequently, a cut on lt had different impacts on the muons and should be studied carefully.",

Table II lists the measured R i 's of radioactive isotopes over the entire energy spectrum. The R i of 9 Li was found to be strongly anti-correlated with both 8 He and 9 C due to their similar lifetimes. This issue can be addressed by applying the neutron tagging method described in Section V, since both 9 C and 8 He are unlikely to produce a neutron, especially if the energy is greater than 7.5 MeV [23]. The relative fractions of 8 B and 8 Li could affect the fit; however the R i of 8 B and 8 Li could not be decoupled due to their similar lifetimes and endpoint energies (\u223c13 MeV for 8 Li and \u223c14 MeV for 8 B). In the fit, the fractions of 8 B and 8 Li were assumed to be equal. By changing the relative fraction of 8 Li from 0 to 1, the differences in the R i 's were calculated and were included in the systematic uncertainty. The measured production rates (Ri) over the entire energy spectrum for spallation-induced radioactive isotopes using the fit in the full time range. The first column lists the names of radioactive isotopes, the second column lists the selection efficiency \u01ebi, and the third column lists the production rates of radioactive isotopes from the fit. The first and second uncertainties in Ri represent the statistical and the systematic uncertainties, respectively. The systematic uncertainties include contributions from the data reduction and the maximum deviation of rates observed by changing the relative fraction of 8 Li from 0 to 1. The fitted rates of 8 He/ 9 C, 11 Be and 15 C are consistent with zero, so we set upper limits at 90% confidence level (C.L.). V. IMPROVEMENT OF THE 9 Li YIELD MEASUREMENT",

Since the precision of the time measurements is much better than the uncertainty of the 9 Li lifetime, the uncertainty on the dt cut was ignored. As for the lt cut, the efficiency varies for different muon classes due to their different lt distributions as already shown in Fig. 2. In particular, the lt distribution of multiple muons is much wider than the others. According to the theory [14], all the spallation isotopes including 9 Li were made in muon showers. In addition to the systematic study in Section IV A 3, we studied the production rate specifically for the multiple muon events. We observed that about 40% of 9 Li's are indeed produced by these events. The systematic uncertainty related to the lt cut is estimated using data, as discussed in Section IV A 3. The systematic uncertainties for the neutron tagging efficiency and the accidental background level were estimated in Section V A 3 and Section V B 1. Since we had an energy threshold cut on the 9 Li energy tail, the difference between the true and the simulated energy spectra could vary with the water transparency, PMT gain and dark noise, etc. These effects were taken into account in MC simulation; the maximum relative deviation in the efficiency for the energy threshold was found to be 8.0% and assigned as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty of BR was obtained from Ref. [16]. The total systematic uncertainty was added in quadrature and was found to be 18.1%. ",

The mean values of the 12 B, 12 N and 16 N theoretical yield calculations are inside the two-sigma confidence interval of the respective measurements. The best-fit 12 B yield is only 2.5% smaller than the calculation while the corresponding 8 Li yield measurement [2] (see Table VI) in scintillator is 42% below expectation. The best-fit 12 N yield is 23% larger than the calculation while the corresponding 8 B yield measurement in scintillator exceeds the calculation by 47%. The best-fit 16 N yield is 30% larger than the calculation, the corresponding 12 B yield measurement in scintillator exceeds the calculation by 54%. The upper limit of the 8 He/ 9 C yield is only 10% lower than the theoretical prediction while the upper limits of 11 Be and 15 C are consistent. However, we found that the yields of the spallation ejecting many nucleons of the 16 O into 8 Li/ 8 B and 9 Li are a factor of 3.6\u22124.1 and 3.1\u22124.7 below the calculations. There is no corresponding spallation of the 12 C nucleus in scintillator, since 4 Li is very short-lived, and 4 H and 5 H do not exist. The larger discrepancy could be owed to the spallation ejecting many nucleons, or a feature of the \u03c0-initiated reaction. While scintillator measurements show agreement for those isotopes within a factor of two, isotopes produced by spallation ejecting many nucleons of 12 C are not measured. We also note that the two different measurements on the 9 Li yield in SK are in good agreement, and the one with neutron tagging is better because of the strong background suppression.",

The path-length distribution of cosmic-ray muons, the relative time and distance distributions between parent muons and daughter isotopes, the energy distribution of 9 Li \u03b2+n decays, and so on are expected to facilitate further insights into the mechanism of spallation in water, which should be useful in developing a more practically powerful tool to reject cosmogenic backgrounds in solar, reactor and supernova relic neutrino experiments. Finally, the yield of 9 Li was more precisely measured by tagging neutrons. This information regarding an important potential background source could aid in the design and optimization of future water Cherenkov detectors that aim to search for SRNs. Agreement of the data with theoretical calculations is in general much better in water than in scintillator; only those isotopes produced as a result of ejecting many nucleons of 16 O significantly deviate -by about a factor of four -from predictions.",
