The search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the standard model expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson are B(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 ) < 0.25% (0.25%) and B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < 0.61% (0.37%), at 95% confidence level. These results are used to derive upper limits on the off-diagonal \u00b5\u03c4 and e\u03c4 Yukawa couplings \u221a |Y \u00b5\u03c4 | 2 + |Y \u03c4 \u00b5 | 2 < 1.43\u00d710 \u22123 and |Y e\u03c4 | 2 + |Y \u03c4 e | 2 < 2.26\u00d710 \u22123 at 95% confidence level. The limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson and on the associated Yukawa couplings are the most stringent to date.",

A combined study of the 7 and 8 TeV data sets collected by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations shows consistency between the measured couplings of the Higgs boson and the standard model (SM) predictions [4]. However, the constraint on the branching fraction to non-SM decay modes derived from these measurements, B(non-SM) < 34% at 95% confidence level (CL), still allows for a significant contribution from exotic decays [4].",

            "text": "In this paper a search for lepton flavour violating (LFV) decays of the Higgs boson in the \u00b5\u03c4 and e\u03c4 channels is presented. These decays are forbidden in the SM but occur in many new physics scenarios. These include supersymmetric [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13], composite Higgs [14,15], or Randall-Sundrum models [16][17][18], SM extensions with more than one Higgs boson doublet [19,20] or with flavour symmetries [21], and many other scenarios [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. The presence of LFV Higgs boson couplings would allow \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5 and \u03c4 \u2192 e to proceed via a virtual Higgs boson [37,38]. Consequently the experimental limits on rare \u03c4 lepton JHEP06 (2018)001decays, such as \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3 [39], provide upper limits on B(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 ) and B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) [40,41] of O(10%). Measurements of the electron and muon magnetic moments, and exclusion limits on the electric dipole moment of the electron also provide complementary constraints [42]. The LFV Higgs boson decay to \u00b5e is strongly constrained by the \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 limit, B(H \u2192 e\u00b5) < O(10 \u22129 ) [43].",

The decay channels H \u2192 e\u03c4 e and H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 \u00b5 , are not considered because of the large background contribution from Z boson decays. The expected final state signatures are very similar to those for the SM H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays, studied by CMS [48][49][50] and ATLAS [51], but with some significant kinematic differences. The electron (muon) in the LFV H \u2192 e(\u00b5)\u03c4 decay is produced promptly, and tends to have a larger momentum than in the SM H \u2192 \u03c4 e(\u00b5) \u03c4 h decay. The search reported in this paper improves upon the sensitivity of the earlier CMS searches [44,45] by using a boosted decision trees (BDT) discriminator to distinguish signal from background events. A separate analysis, similar in strategy to the previous CMS publications, is performed as cross check. The results of both strategies are reported in this paper.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon JHEP06 (2018)001pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The two-level CMS trigger system selects events of interest for permanent storage [52]. The first trigger level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The software algorithms of the high-level trigger, executed on a farm of commercial processors, reduce the event rate to about 1 kHz using information from all detector subsystems. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [53].",

            "text": "The analyses presented here use samples of pp collisions collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Isolated single muon triggers are used to collect the data samples in the H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 search. Triggers requiring a single isolated electron, or a combination of an electron and a muon, are used in the H \u2192 e\u03c4 h and H \u2192 e\u03c4 \u00b5 channels, respectively. Simulated samples of signal and background events are produced with several event generators. The Higgs bosons are produced in pp collisions predominantly by gluon fusion (ggH) [54], but also by vector boson fusion (VBF) [55], and in association with a W or Z boson [56]. The ggH and VBF Higgs boson samples are generated with powheg 2.0 [57][58][59][60][61][62] while the minlo hvJ [63] extension of powheg 2.0 is used for the WH and ZH simulated samples. The MG5 amc@nlo [64] generator is used for Z + jets and W + jets processes. They are simulated at leading order (LO) with the MLM jet matching and merging [65]. Diboson production is simulated at next-to-LO (NLO) using MG5 amc@nlo generator with the FxFx jet matching and merging [66], whereas powheg 2.0 and 1.0 are used for tt and single top quark production, respectively. The powheg and MadGraph generators are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [67] for parton showering, fragmentation, and decays. The pythia parameters for the underlying event description are set to the CUETP8M1 tune [68]. Due to the high instantaneous luminosities attained during data taking, many events have multiple pp interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The effect is taken into account in simulated samples, by generating concurrent minimum bias events. All simulated samples are weighted to match the pileup distribution observed in data, that has an average of approximately 27 interactions per bunch crossing. The CMS detector response is modelled using Geant4 [69].",

The reconstruction starts from a jet and searches for the products of the main \u03c4 lepton decay modes: one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions, or three charged hadrons. To improve the reconstruction efficiency in the case of conversion of the photons from neutral-pion decay, the algorithm considers the PF photons and electrons from a strip along the azimuthal direction \u03c6. The charges of all the PF objects from tau lepton decay, except for the electrons from neutral pions, are summed to reconstruct the tau lepton charge. An MVA discriminator, based on the information of the reconstructed tau lepton and of the charged particles in a cone around it, is used to reduce the rate for quark-and gluon-initiated jets identified as \u03c4 candidates. The working point used in the analysis has an efficiency of about 60% for a genuine \u03c4 h , with approximately a 0.5% misidentification rate for quark and gluon jets [76]. Additionally, muons and electrons misidentified as tau leptons are rejected using a dedicated set of selection criteria based on the consistency between the measurements in the tracker, calorimeters, and muon detectors. The specific identification criteria depend on the final state studied and on the background composition. The tau leptons that decay to muons and electrons are reconstructed as prompt muons and electrons as described above.",

The data set analysed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The results are extracted by a fit to the output of a boosted decision trees discriminator trained to distinguish the signal from backgrounds. The results are cross-checked with an alternate analysis that fits the collinear mass distribution after applying selection criteria on kinematic variables. No evidence is found for lepton flavour violating Higgs boson decays. The observed (expected) limits on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to \u00b5\u03c4 and to e\u03c4 are less than 0.25% (0.25%) and 0.61% (0.37%), respectively, at 95% confidence level. These limits constitute a significant improvement over the previously obtained limits by CMS and ATLAS using 8 TeV proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb \u22121 .
