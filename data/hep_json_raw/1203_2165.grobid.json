Using the decay lepton transverse momentum and the missing transverse momentum, the W decay angular distribution projected onto the transverse plane is obtained and analysed in terms of helicity fractions f 0 , f L and f R over two ranges of W transverse momentum (p W T ) : 35 < p W T < 50 GeV and p W T > 50 GeV. Good agreement is found with theoretical predictions. For p W   T > 50 GeV, the values of f 0 and f L \u2212 f R , averaged over charge and lepton flavour, are measured to be: f 0 = 0.127\u00b10.030\u00b10.108 and f L \u2212f R = 0.252\u00b10.017\u00b10.030, where the first uncertainties are statistical, and the second include all systematic effects.",

The construction of helicity templates and its validation using Monte Carlo samples is described in Sect. 6, while the uncorrected results are given in Sect. 7.

In order to study the sensitivity of the angular distributions to different NLO PDF sets, the MC@NLO sample was reweighted [26]  . The Monte Carlo samples were generated with, in average, two soft inelastic collisions overlaid on the hard-scattering event. Events were subsequently reweighted so that the distribution of the number of reconstructed vertices matched that in data, which was 2.2 on average.",

The longitudinal fraction, which is very small for low p W T , grows with p W T (especially at low |y W |), before flattening out and then starting to decrease. The difference between the frac-tions of left-and right-handed W bosons is small for low |y W | and grows quickly with |y W |, reaching up to 70 % for |y W | = 3. As already explained in Sect. 1, a smaller leftright difference is expected for negative than for positive W bosons; however in the p W T range analysed here, these differences differ by at most a few percent. The analysis of systematic uncertainties described in Sect. 8.5, shows that it is experimentally advantageous to average the measured values of f L \u2212 f R between the two charges. As an anticipation of this observation, it can be seen in Fig. 5 that this averaging is physically meaningful.",

In the SHERPA case the only uncertainty quoted is associated with the two ways of calculating the correction term: applying SHERPA templates either to MC@NLO or to POWHEG simulated data while POWHEG predicts a somewhat smaller difference between left-and right-handed states than observed in the data. The same good agreement between data and MC@NLO remains after averaging results over lepton flavours (Table 11). While the complete NNLO cross-section calculation of [7] has not been implemented in a Monte Carlo generator, it can be seen in Fig. 5 and its equivalent (not shown) for BlackHat, that at the particle level, without any cuts, the f L \u2212 f R values from [7] are on average about 5 % lower (in absolute terms) than the MC@NLO predictions.
