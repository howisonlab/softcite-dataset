The pp collision data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb \u22121 , collected with the LHCb detector, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Combining our measured value of 1.010 AE 0.010 AE 0.008 for this ratio with the knownB 0 lifetime, we determine the flavor-specificB 0 s lifetime to be \u03c4\u00f0B 0 s \u00de \u00bc 1.535 AE 0.015 AE 0.014 ps, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. This is the most precise measurement to date, and is consistent with previous measurements and theoretical predictions.",

In the case of neutral mesons, the decay rates are not purely exponential, but are modified by flavor mixing and charge parity (CP ) violation. TheB 0 s meson's decay width \u0393 s differs for the heavy and light mass eigenstates, by an amount \u0394\u0393 s that has been measured to be significantly different from zero [1]. This gives rise to a rich phenomenology of mixing and CP violation. Precision measurement of the lifetime \u03c4 s \u00bc \u210f=\u0393 s is therefore an important benchmark. The ratio ofB 0 s toB 0 lifetimes is well predicted in the heavy quark expansion model [2], which is used to extract values of the quark-mixing parameters jV cb j and jV ub j, and thus lifetime measurements provide a precision test of the theory.",

Given their well-known lifetimes, this provides a robust check on the validity of the procedure. We then measure theB 0 s =B y lifetime ratio for each of the three samples. The exponential fits for theB 0 s =B y lifetime ratios are shown in Fig. 4, with the results given in Table I. In each case good agreement with the known values of the lightB meson lifetime ratio is found, and the three values of theB 0 s lifetime are consistent.",

The statistical precision on the relative acceptance is the largest source of systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties due to the background description are estimated by comparing the nominal result to that obtained when the linear background slope is allowed to float separately in each decay time bin; in addition, an exponential shape is used, and the largest deviation is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. Using a different signal shape to fit the data (double Crystal Ball function [13]) leads to small changes. There is also an uncertainty due to the decay time range and binning used. These uncertainties are ascertained by changing the fit range limits down to 0.5 ps and changing the size of the bins from 0.3 to 1 ps. The relative measurements with respect to the three control samples agree within 0.005 ps, and this is conservatively added to the total systematic uncertainty.",

A rather precise prediction of \u0393 d =\u0393 s is given using the heavy quark expansion model [2]. To compare with our measured lifetime ratio we apply a 0.8% correction from Eq. 1, resulting in a corrected prediction for our measured lifetime ratio of 1.009 AE 0.004, in excellent agreement with our measurement, lending credence to this model.
