            "text": "The last decade was remarkable for neutrino physics. In particular, the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations has been firmly established by a series of independent measurements. All parameters of the neutrino mixing are now known, and we have the elements to plan a judicious exploration of new scenarios that are opened by these recent advances. With precise measurements, we can test the three-neutrino paradigm, neutrino mass hierarchy, and charge conjugation parity (CP) asymmetry in the lepton sector. The future long-baseline experiments are considered to be a fundamental tool to deepen our knowledge of electroweak interactions. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will detect a broadband neutrino beam from Fermilab in an underground massive liquid argon time-projection chamber at an L/E of about 10 3 km GeV \u22121 to reach good sensitivity for CP-phase measurements and the determination of the mass hierarchy. The dimensions and the depth of the far detector also create an excellent opportunity to look for rare signals like proton decay to study violation of the baryonic number, as well as supernova neutrino bursts, broadening the scope of the experiment to astrophysics and associated impacts in cosmology. In this paper, we discuss the physics motivations and the main experimental features of the DUNE project required to reach its scientific goals.",

            "text": "Although the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics presents a remarkably accurate description of the elementary particles and their interactions, it is known that the current model is incomplete and that a more fundamental underlying theory must exist. Results from the last decades, namely the three known types of neutrinos have nonzero mass, mix with one another, and oscillate between generations, imply physics beyond SM. The neutrino mass generation appears to be more complex than the Higgs mechanism embedded in the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg electroweak theory. The neutrino interactions have very small cross-sections; for this reason, neutrinos can be observed and studied only via intense neutrino sources and large detectors. Neutrino experiments can be a straightforward way (at lower cost) to test the fundamentals of electroweak interactions. Additionally, a large detector placed underground, in a low-background environment, can be used to study rare processes such as the proton decay or supernovae neutrino bursts, in which neutrinos seem to play a major role in the core-collapse mechanism and the subsequent ejection of the star's matter. If the collapsing star is massive enough, it can also end as a black hole. The following list summarizes the above remarks and their related open questions in neutrino physics:",

GUTs Cross-section of the beam line at Fermilab. (From right to left) Protons are extracted from the main injector and are pointed to Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). Proton collisions at the target produce pions, which decay into muons and neutrinos. Muons are filtered in the absorber, and the remaining neutrino beam goes through the near detector and finally to the \u223c 1300-km-long path through the Earth's crust until the far detector predict that protons should decay, a process that has never been observed. To address all of these questions, the worldwide neutrino physics community is developing a long-term program to measure the unknown parameters of the SM of particle physics and search for new phenomena. The physics program will be carried out as an international, leading-edge, dual-site experiment for neutrino science and proton decay studies, which is known as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The infrastructure for the beam and the experimental sites constitutes the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF). Together, DUNE and LBNF represent a very ambitious program in neutrino and elementary particle science, not to mention the impacts of the expected outcomes in astrophysics and cosmology. DUNE will comprise two experimental sites. The first is at the Fermilab site, hosting the world's highest intensity neutrino beam and a high-precision near detector (ND). The second is at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) 1300 km away in Lead (SD), where a 40-kiloton (kt) liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) far detector (FD) will be installed underground (\u223c1500 m deep). Fermilab will also provide all the conventional and technical facilities necessary to support the beamline and detector systems.",

It exploits the same configuration of a target-and-horn system, with the spacing of the target and two horns tuned to obtain an intense neutrino flux at the first oscillation maximum and to extend as much as possible to the second as well. Profiting from the effective experience of the NuMI design, the decay pipe is helium-filled, while the target chase is air-filled. The proton beam energy can be adjusted within the 60-120 GeV range, with the corresponding range of beam power of 1.0-1.2 MW. The ability to vary the proton beam energy is essential for optimizing the neutrino spectrum and to understand systematic effects in the beam production. An energy-tunable neutrino beam also provides the flexibility to allow addressing future questions in neutrino physics that may require a different neutrino energy spectrum. The reference design has values of 204 m length and 4 m diameter for the decay pipe, both matching well to the physics of DUNE, but studies to determine the optimal dimensions are continuing. The main elements of the beamline are shown in Figure 1.",

A sketch of both proposals (SP and DP) can be found in Figure 2. The 10-kt TPC reference design has an active volume with 12 m height, 14.5 m width, and 58 m length. The TPC is instrumented with anode plane assemblies (APAs), which are 6.3 m high and 2.3 m wide, and cathode plane assemblies (CPAs), which are 3 m high by 2.3 wide. They are arranged in stacks, forming walls (three CPAs interleaved by two APAs) and providing drift modules separated by 3.6 m each along the beam direction (see Figure 3). The CPAs are held at 180 kV so that ionization electrons drift to a maximum distance of 3.6 m in an electric field of 500 V cm \u22121 . The ultimate validation of the engineered solutions for both designs of the FD is foreseen in the context of the neutrino activities at the CERN around 2018, where full-scale engineering prototypes will be assembled and commissioned. Following this milestone, a test-beam data campaign will be executed to collect a large sample of charged particle interactions in order to study the response of the detector with high precision. There is recognition that the LArTPC technology will continue to evolve with (a) the large-scale prototypes at the CERN Neutrino Platform and the experience from the Fermilab SBN program (Acciarri et al. 2015b), and (b) the experience gained during the construction and commissioning of the first 10-kt module. The chosen strategy for implementing the FD is a staged approach. The deployment of consecutive modules will enable an early science program while allowing implementation of improvements and developments during the experiments' lifetime.",

DUNE plans to pursue a detailed study of neutrino mixing, resolve the neutrino mass ordering, and search for CP violation in the lepton sector by studying the oscillation patterns of high-intensity and beams measured over a long baseline. The oscillation probability of flavor conversion P( \u2192 e ), to first order FIGURE 4 Schematic drawing of the near detector (ND) fine-grained tracker design (Nunokawa et al. 2008), considering the propagation of a neutrino beam through matter in a constant density approximation, has two major contributions for observations of CP asymmetry: CP and a = G f N e \u2215 \u221a 2, where G f is the Fermi constant, and N e is the e \u2212 number density of the matter crossed by neutrinos. Both CP and a switch signs in going from neutrinos to antineutrinos. The matter effect is modulated by the value of the constant a, according to the presence of e \u2212 and the absence of e + . In the few-GeV energy range, the asymmetry from the matter effect increases with the baseline as the neutrinos pass through more matter, and therefore an experiment with a longer baseline will be more sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH). For baselines longer than \u223c1200 km, the degeneracy between the asymmetries from matter and CP-violation effects can be resolved; hence DUNE, with a baseline of 1300 km, will be able to unambiguously determine the neutrino MH and measure the value of CP (Diwan 2004). The experimental sensitivities presented here are estimated using GLoBES (Huber et al. 2005). GLoBES takes neutrino beam fluxes, cross-sections, and detector response parameterization as inputs. Also included are the dependences on the design of the neutrino beam. The cross-section inputs to GLoBES have been generated using GENIE 2.8.4 (Andreopoulos et al. 2010). The neutrino oscillation parameters and the uncertainty on those parameters are taken from the Nu-Fit (Gonzalez-Garcia et al. 2014) global fit to the neutrino data. Sensitivities to the neutrino MH and the degree of CP violation are obtained by performing a simultaneous fit over the \u2192 and \u2192 e oscillation spectra. Figure 5 shows the significance with which the MH can be determined as a function of the value of CP , for an exposure that corresponds to 7 years of data (3.5 years in the neutrino mode and 3.5 years in the antineutrino mode) with a 40-kt detector and a 1.07-MW (80-GeV) beam. For this exposure, the MH is determined with a minimum significance of FIGURE 5 Significance with which the mass hierarchy can be determined as a function of the value of CP for an exposure of 300 kt \u00d7 MW \u00d7 year, assuming normal mass hierarchy (MH) (top) or inverted MH (bottom).

This regime is of particular interest for the detection of the burst of neutrinos from a Galactic core-collapse supernova. DUNE is primarily sensitive to electron flavor supernova neutrinos, and this capability is unique among existing and proposed supernova neutrino detectors for the coming decades. Neutrinos from other astrophysical sources are also potentially detectable. Liquid argon has a particular sensitivity to the e component of a supernova neutrino burst, via the charged-current (CC) absorption, e + 40 Ar \u2192 e \u2212 + 40 Ar * for which the observables are the e \u2212 plus de-excitation products from the K * final state, as well as the e interaction and elastic scattering on electrons. DUNE's capability to characterize the e component of the signal is unique and critical. Other interesting astrophysics studies can also be carried out by DUNE, such as solar neutrinos' and supernova neutrinos' diffuse background, neutrinos from accretion disks, and black hole-neutron star mergers. There may also be signatures of dark matter weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) annihilations in the low-energy signal range. Neutral-current (NC) scattering on Ar nuclei by any type of neutrino, x + 40 Ar \u2192 x + 40 Ar * , is another process of interest for supernova detection in the LAr detectors, although it",

The predicted event rate (NC or CC) from a supernova burst is calculated by folding the expected neutrino differential energy spectra with the cross-sections for the relevant channels and with the detector response. The number of signal events scales with mass and inverse square of the distance, as shown in Figure 7. The rates in the figure show the ability of DUNE to have a large statistics in case of a Galactic supernova and to resolve astrophysical phenomena to be observable in the neutrino burst signatures. In particular, the supernova explosion mechanism, which in the current paradigm involves energy deposition via neutrinos, is still not well understood, and the neutrinos themselves will bring the insight needed to confirm or refute the paradigm.",

            "text": "GUTs unite the three gauge interactions of particle physics, namely strong, weak, and electromagnetic, into one single force. One of the consequences is the predictions about baryon number violation and proton lifetime that may be accessible to DUNE, since the observation requires a kiloton detector working in a low-background environment (Senjanovic 2010). Although no evidence for proton decay has been detected, lifetime limits from the current generation of experiments constrain the construction of GUT models. In Estimated numbers of supernova neutrino interactions in Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) ( e events dominate) as a function of distance to the supernova, for a 10-kt detector (red band) and a 40-kt detector (green band). The width of the bands indicates the range of possibilities for a Garching-parameterized (Tamborra et al. 2012) supernova flux spectrum, in both favorable and nonfavorable cases. All parameters from the neutrino spectrum were considered constant in time. The detector resolution is the same as that of Icarus, and the detection threshold is 5 MeV some cases, these limits are approaching the upper bounds of what these models will allow. This situation points naturally toward continuing the search with new and highly capable underground detectors, especially those with improved sensitivity to specific proton decay modes favored by GUT models. In particular, the exquisite imaging, particle identification, and calorimetric response of the DUNE LArTPC FD open the possibility of obtaining evidence for nucleon decay on the basis of a single well-reconstructed event. The strength of the DUNE experiment for proton decay studies relies on the capability to detect two significant decay modes: The first is p \u2192 e + 0 , which is often predicted to have the higher branching fraction. The event kinematics and final states make this channel particularly suitable for a water Cherenkov detector. The second is p \u2192 K + . This mode is dominant in most supersymmetric GUTs, and is uniquely interesting for DUNE since stopping kaons have a higher ionization density than lower mass particles. An LArTPC could identify the K + track with high efficiency. Also, many final states of K + decay would be fully reconstructible in an LArTPC. The advantage of LArTPC over Cherenkov detectors is clear from the comparison of efficiencies and backgrounds (per kt) for the decays with K in final states. While LArTPC efficiencies are >95% in most channels, Cherenkov detector efficiencies are in the range of 10-20%. In LArTPC, the background is <2 counts, while in Cherenkov detectors it can go up to 8 counts (Kearns 2013). Another promising way of probing baryon number violation in DUNE is through the search for the spontaneous conversion of neutrons into antineutrons in the nuclear environment. While these are less well motivated theoretically, opportunistic experimental searches cost little and could have a large payoff. Based on the expected signal efficiency and upper limits on the background rates, the expected limit on FIGURE 8 Proton decay lifetime limit for p \u2192 K + as a function of time for underground liquid argon time-projection chambers (LArTPCs), starting with an initial 10 kt and adding another 10 kt each year for 4 years, for a total of 40 kt. For comparison, the current limits from the Super Kamiokande and a projected limit from the Hyper Kamiokande are also shown. The limits are at 90% CL, calculated for a Poisson process including background, assuming that the detected events equal the expected background the proton lifetime as a function of running time in DUNE for p \u2192 K + is shown in Figure 8.",

In the last years, a strong collaboration has been formed. The strategy for construction has been extensively discussed, which has provided solid ground for a clear construction plan. DUNE and LBNF together consist one of the most ambitious neu-trino experiments for the next era of precise measurements. DUNE can shed light on some intriguing open questions in physics, such as the ordering of neutrino mass eigenstates and CP violation in the lepton sector. The expected results will be highly significant in statistical terms and can be achieved in reasonable time. Moreover, there is a rich non-oscillation physics program, covering topics such as supernovae, nucleon decay, and neutrinos interactions. With DUNE and LBNF, we foresee impressive technical and scientific achievements for neutrino physics in the next decade.",
