The experimental signature is an energetic jet pair with invariant mass of O(1) TeV and O(100) GeV missing transverse momentum. The analysis uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In the signal region the 2252 observed events are consistent with the background estimation. Assuming a 125 GeV scalar particle with Standard Model cross sections, the upper limit on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay into invisible particles is 0.37 at 95% confidence level where 0.28 was expected. This limit is interpreted in Higgs portal models to set bounds on the wimp-nucleon scattering cross section. We also consider invisible decays of additional scalar bosons with masses up to 3 TeV for which the upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are in the range of 0.3-1.7 pb.",

The hypothesis under consideration [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] is that the Higgs boson might decay into a pair of weakly interacting massive particles (wimp) [17,18], which may explain the nature of dark matter (see Ref. [19] and the references therein). The search carried out for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is repeated for hypothetical scalars with masses up to 3 TeV. The search is independent on the decay of the mediator because the final state particles are invisible to the detector, while it is dependent on its E miss T distribution (defined below) because that quantity is reflective of the mediator's p T distribution.",

In this analysis, several changes and improvements are made with respect to the previous ATLAS paper on this topic [28]. The trigger and hadronic objects are defined considering the simultaneous pp collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings (pileup) (Section 2). The leading backgrounds are simulated using state-of-the-art QCD predictions (Section 3). The event selections are changed to retain a good sensitivity despite the higher pileup. The analysis extracts the signal yield using a binned likelihood fit to the m jj spectrum in 3 bins to increase the signal sensitivity (Section 4). The estimation of the important and dominant background for the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd process (denoted Z \u03bd\u03bd ) relies only on the Z ee and Z \u03bc\u03bc control samples, and is not affected by theoretical uncertainties of the W -to-Z extrapolation (Section 5). The systematic uncertainties are evaluated separately for each m jj bin (Section 6). The search is repeated for other scalars with masses up to 3 TeV, which can easily be reinterpreted for models not considered in this Letter (Section 7). Several aspects of the analysis have not changed compared to the ATLAS Run-1 analysis-e.g., subdetector descriptions, transfer factor method, Higgs portal models-and details of these may be found in Ref.",

            "text": "The billionfold-or-more reduction of multijets after the event selection makes it impractical to simulate, so a data-driven method based on a rebalance-and-smear strategy [72] is used. The assumption is that the E miss T is due to jet mismeasurement in the detector response to jets and neutrinos from heavy-flavor decays [73,74]. Using the jet-triggered sample, the jet momenta are rebalanced by a kinematic fit, within their experimental uncertainties, to obtain the balanced value of the jets' p T . The rebalanced jets are smeared according to jet response templates, which are obtained from MC and validated with dijet data. The rebalance-and-smear method predicts both the shape of the E miss T distribution and the absolute normalization. The procedure is verified in a \u03c6 jj -sideband validation region (VR) with 95% purity of QCD multijet events. This VR is defined by 1.8 < | \u03c6 jj | < 2.7 and the loosening of the other requirements (| \u03b7 jj | > 3, m jj > 0.6 TeV, and allow a third leading jet with 25 < p T < 50 GeV, but no other jets with p T > 25 GeV). The comparison of the predictions and the data in the VR shows good agreement (Fig. 3). The multijet component is obtained using the rebalance-and-smear method with the associated systematic uncertainty bands, while the non-multijet components are obtained using MC.",

The \"visual\" column shows bars whose lengths from the center tick are proportional to . The second set shows the effect on the yields and the \u03b1 transfer factors for the 1 < m jj \u2264 1.5 TeV bin. The yields are for the signal process in the SR (S), Z MC in the SR (B sr Z ), and Z MC in the CR (B cr Z ).

The individual yields for the W are not shown because the cancellation effects are similar to the Z counterparts. The value for \"3rd jet veto\" corresponds only to the uncertainty related to jet bin migration for signal processes; the corresponding effect for the background processes are evaluated in the various jet energy and theoretical variations. The abbreviations for the theoretical sources are described in the text. The '-' indicates that the quantity is not applicable. The \"combined\" rows at the bottom are not simple sums of the rows above because of the metric; the symbols ( \u2020, \u2021, ) are parenthetically defined in the table. The penultimate (last) row shows the summary impact of removing the systematic uncertainties due to the experimental and theoretical sources (as well as statistical uncertainties of the MC samples). The effects of the theoretical variations are evaluated with a sample of generated MC events prior to reconstruction, which is larger than the reconstructed sample. Moreover, in order to reduce fluctuations due to limited MC statistics, the effect of the resummation and ckkw variations as a function of m jj are determined by a linear fit, using m jj values below the selection for the SR and a sample with loosened selection on \u03b7 jj and \u03c6 jj .
