            "text": "Testing gravity at the shortest attainable distances is interesting for many reasons. String theory's unifcation of gravity with the other 3 fundamental interactions inherently involves extra gravitational space dimensions as well as many nominally-massless scalar particles (dilaton and moduli). Both of these features would violate the gravitational inverse-square law (ISL) [1,2], as would a second, heavy graviton [3]. New phenomena could occur below the length scale associated with dark energy \u03bb d = 4 hc/\u03c1 d \u2248 85 \u00b5m where \u03c1 d \u2248 3.8 keV/cm 3 is the observed density of dark energy [4,5]. Suggestions that dark matter may consist of ultra-low-mass scalar and vector bosons [6,7], whose exchange interaction would violate the ISL, provide further motivation for exploring this regime. It is customary to interpret ISL data as constraining an additional Yukawa interaction",

Here we report results from two latest generations of the E\u00f6t-Wash rotatingattractor torsion-balance ISL tests. In these tests, harmonic torques, exerted on a detector pendulum by a rotating attractor, are studied as functions of separation s between the facing surfaces of the detector and attractor test bodies. Our new device offers significant improvements over those used previously [5,[9][10][11]. The new testbody design (see Fig. 1) has both 18-fold and 120-fold azimuthal symmetries and tests the ISL at two different length scales at once. The 50%-transparent hole pattern maximizes the signals for a given test-body diameter. Furthermore, the Fourier-Bessel expansion provides nearly-analytic (a single numerical integration) solutions for Newtonian, Yukawa and dipole-dipole torques [12,14].",

Each data point comprised \u03b8 (an autocollimator measurement of the detector twist angle), \u03c6 (the turntable angle from a highresolution encoder), the capacitance between the detector and the electrostatic shield (a key element in determining s), plus a dozen other parameters such as apparatus tilts, various temperatures, etc. Because the Fourier-Bessel hole pattern repeats every 60 degrees the data streams were cut into 60 degree segments typically containing 680 points. The \u03b8(\u03c6) data in each cut were fit with harmonic terms and low-order polynomial drift [5,10]. The datataking cadence and \u03c9 were set so that each cut contained integral numbers of data points and free-torsional oscillations and that the 18\u03c9 and 120\u03c9 signals lay in lownoise regions of the torque power spectrum (see bottom panel in Fig. 2). Harmonic torques N n\u03c9 were inferred using N n\u03c9 =\u03b8 n\u03c9 I\u03c9 2 0 where\u03b8 n\u03c9 was the harmonic amplitude corrected for pendulum inertia plus electronic and digital-filter [12] time constants, I (91.7 g cm 2 in generation 2) was the detector's rotational inertia computed from a detailed numerical model, and \u03c9 0 \u2248 .0184 s \u22121 was the detector's free-oscillation frequency. (Uncertainties in I have no effect on our results because I appears in both the Fourier-Bessel and calibration-sphere torques.) Electrostatic \"patch\" effects [17] altered \u03c9 0 at small s so, before and after each science run, \u03c9 0 was measured in \"sweep runs\" where the free-oscillation amplitude (typically \u223c 4 \u00b5rad) was increased to about 20 \u00b5rad; this gave more precise values for \u03c9 0 and also provided corrections for small nonlinearities in the autocollimator angle scale. As shown in Fig. 3, accurate values for the displacement, \u03b6, were obtained with the aid of micrometers on the x,y,z stage that supported the torsion fiber. Measurements of the 120\u03c9 gravitational torques as functions of x and y gave the horizontal displacement, while electrical capacitances as functions of z were used to obtain the vertical displacement . The main challenges were fabricating and then positioning with \u00b5m accuracy 5.5 cm-diameter objects (one of them suspended from an 83 cm-long torsion fiber), minimizing stray electrostatic and magnetostatic effects, dealing with seismic vibrations, and eliminating dust particles that can prevent taking data at small s. The detector was gold-coated and surrounded by Smooth lines show the thermal (and autocollimator) noise assuming Q = 1000. The 54\u03c9 peak is the 3rd harmonic of the n = 18 signal. For this run, the 18\u03c9 and 120\u03c9 signals were set to 1/2 and 10/3 times the free-oscillation frequency \u03c90. The 36\u03c9 peak occurs at \u03c90 and is a residue of the free oscillation; it is not a 2nd harmonic torque of the n = 18 pattern as all even harmonics vanish in our geometry. a rigid, almost hermetic, gold-coated electrostatic shield; its key element was a 10\u00b5m-thick, tightly-stretched goldcoated beryllium-copper foil located between the detector and attractor. Seismic vibrations coupled to patch fields substantially increased the noise when the pendulumfoil separation was less than 30 \u00b5m. Multi-layer \u00b5metal shields isolated the detector from external fields as well as from the turntable motor. Instrumental temperature variations during a run were controlled at the \u00b15 mK level.",

            "text": "We made the usual checks for systematic effects [5,10] by varying temperatures and their gradients, impressing electrical and magnetic fields on the detector and attractor, etc. The only significant systematic effect arose from the magnetic susceptibility of the platinum test bodies. An ambient magnetic field will slightly magnetize the metal test bodies inducing a dipole-dipole interaction between the attractor and detector that is not attenuated by our electrostatic shield. The induced magnetic interaction from a vertical field B z is attractive, while for horizontal fields B x and B y the induced interaction is repulsive. We studied this systematic effect using Helmholtz coils and observed just such behavior. The largest effect arises from B z fields and is shown in the top panel of Fig. 4. The effects of horizontal fields were at least 20 times smaller. With the detector at s = 72 \u00b5m we observed the 120\u03c9 torque as a function of B z . This torque was parabolic with a minimum at B z = +65 \u00b5T and a strength consistent with the value measured in our science data. Furthermore, the +65 \u00b5T value was consistent with that needed to cancel the measured ambient field. This demonstrated that, as expected, there was no magnetic effect linear in B z , and it allowed us to determine the magnetic contribution to the 120\u03c9 torque. Then, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, we measured the s-dependence of the magnetic 18\u03c9, 120\u03c9 and 54\u03c9 (the 3rd harmonic of the 18\u03c9 signal) torques. The Fourier-Bessel framework provides semi-analytic solutions for the magnetic dipole-dipole [14] torques in azimuthal [14] or axial [19] geometries. Fourier-Bessel spin-spin predictions with a single adjustable scale parameter agree with our observations. The 120\u03c9 signal had the only significant (roughly 1%) magnetic contribution which we subtracted using the data in Fig. 4. The resulting \"gravitational\" torques are shown in Fig. 5.",

Unless shown otherwise, uncertainties are smaller than the plot symbols. Data points with essentially the same s are combined for display purposes only. The Newtonian fit is shown and has P = 0.654. Adding a Yukawa term did not improve the fit appreciably. Bottom plot: corresponding 95% confidence upper limits on |\u03b1| from this and previous works[5,10,16,[21][22][23][24][25][26]29].",
