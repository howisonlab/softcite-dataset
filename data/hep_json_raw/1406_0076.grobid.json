            "text": "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collision data with a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti-k t algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6, and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a Z boson, for 20 \u2264 p jet T < 1000 GeV and pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 4.5. The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region (|\u03b7| < 1.2) for jets with 55 \u2264 p jet T < 500 GeV. For central jets at lower p T , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton-proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for p jet T > 1 TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet p T balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low-p T jets at |\u03b7| = 4.5. Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks or gluons, are also discussed. The magnitude of these uncertainties depends on the event sample used in a given physics analysis, but typically amounts to 0.5-3 %.",

[2], is based on information available before the first proton-proton collisions at the LHC, and initial proton-proton collision data taken in 2010. A reduced uncertainty of about 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region over a wide p T range of 60 p T < 800 GeV was achieved after applying the increased knowledge of the detector performance obtained during the analysis of this first year of ATLAS data taking [3]. This estimation used single-hadron calorimeter response measurements, systematic variations of MC simulation configurations, and in situ techniques, where the jet transverse momentum is compared to the p T of a reference object. These measurements were performed using the 2010 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb \u22121 [4].",

The Monte Carlo simulation framework is presented in Sect. 3, and the used dataset is described in Sect. 4. Section 5 summarises the jet reconstruction and calibration strategy. The correction method for the effect of additional proton-proton interactions is discussed in Sect. 6. Section 7 provides an overview of the techniques based on p T balance that are described in detail in Sects. 8 to 11. First the intercalibration between the central and the forward detector using events with two high-p T jets is presented in Sect. 8. Then, in situ techniques to assess differences of the jet energy measurement between data and Monte Carlo simulation exploiting the p T balance between a jet and a wellmeasured reference object are detailed. The reference objects are Z bosons in Sect. 9, photons in Sect. 10, and a system of low-p T jets in Sect. 11. The validation of the forward-jet energy measurements with p T balance methods using Z -jet and \u03b3 -jet events follows in Sect. 12. The strategy on how to extract a final jet calibration out of the combination of in situ techniques, and the evaluation strategies for determining the corresponding systematic uncertainties, are discussed in Sect. 13. The same section also shows the final result of the jet calibration, including its systematic uncertainty, from the combination of the in situ techniques. Section 14 compares the JES uncertainty as derived from the single-hadron calorimeter response measurements to that obtained from the in situ method based on p T balance discussed in the preceding sections. Comparisons to JES uncertainties using the W boson mass constraint in final states with hadronically decaying W bosons are presented in Sect. 15.",

In any LAr calorimeter cell, the reconstructed energy is sensitive to the proton-proton interactions occurring in approximately 12 (2011 data, 24 at LHC design conditions) preceding and one immediately following bunch crossings (out-oftime pile-up), in addition to pile-up interactions in the current bunch crossing (in-time pile-up). This is due to the relatively long charge collection time in these calorimeters (typically 400-600 ns), as compared to the bunch crossing intervals at the LHC (design 25 ns and actually 50 ns in 2011 data). To reduce this sensitivity, a fast, bipolar shaped signal 2 is used with net zero integral over time.",

Pile-up suppression is further limited by large fluctuations in the number of additional interactions from bunch crossing to bunch crossing, and in the energy flow patterns of the individual collisions in the time window of sensitivity of approximately 600 ns. Consequently, the shaped signal extracted by digital filtering shows a principal sensitivity to in-time and out-of-time pile-up, in particular in terms of a residual non-zero cell-signal baseline.

The simulation uses a 2 \u2192 1 matrix element to model the hard sub-process, and, as for the inclusive jet simulation, p T -ordered parton showers to model additional parton radiation in the LL approximation. In addition, weights are applied to the first branching of the shower, so as to bring agreement with the matrix-element rate in the hard emission region. The same tune and PDF is used as for the inclusive jet sample. 2. The Alpgen generator (version 2.13) [37] is used to produce Z -jet events, interfaced to Herwig (version 6.510) [31] for parton shower and fragmentation into particles, and to Jimmy (version 4.31) [38] to model UE contributions using the ATLAS AUET2 tune [39], here with the CTEQ6L1 [35] leading-order PDF set. Alpgen is a leading-order matrix-element generator for hard multiparton processes (2 \u2192 n) in hadronic collisions. Parton showers are matched to the matrix element with the MLM matching scheme. The CTEQ6L1 PDF set is employed. 3. The baseline \u03b3 -jet sample is produced with Pythia (version 6.425). It generates non-diffractive events using a 2 \u2192 2 matrix element at leading order in \u03b1 S to model the hard sub-process. Again, additional parton radiation is modelled by p T -ordered parton showers in the LL approximation. The modelling of non-perturbative physics effects arising in MPI, fragmentation, and hadronisation is based on the ATLAS AUET2B MRST LO** tune. 4. An alternative \u03b3 -jet event sample is generated with Herwig (version 6.510) and Jimmy using the ATLAS AUET2 tune and the MRST LO** PDF. It is used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty due to physics modelling. 5. The systematic uncertainty from jets which are misidentified as photons (fake photons) is studied with a dedicated MC event sample. An inclusive jet sample is generated with Pythia (version 6.425) with the same parameter tuning and PDF set as the \u03b3 -jet sample. An additional filter is applied to the jets built from the stable gener-ated particles to select events containing a narrow particle jet, which is more likely to pass photon identification criteria. The surviving events are passed through the same detector simulation software as the MC \u03b3 -jet sample.",

The LHC bunch train structure with 36 proton bunches per train and 50 ns spacing between the bunches, is also modelled by organising the simulated collisions into four such trains. This allows the inclusion of out-of-time pile-up effects driven by the distance of the hard-scatter events from the beginning of the bunch train. The first ten bunch crossings in each LHC bunch train, approximately, are characterised by varying out-of-time pile-up contributions from the collision history, which is getting filled with an increasing number of bunch crossings with proton-proton interactions. For the remaining \u224826 bunch crossings in a train, the effect of the out-of-time pile-up contribution is stable, i.e. it does not vary with the bunch position within the bunch train, if the bunchto-bunch intensity is constant.

The signal significance is measured by the absolute ratio of the cell signal to the energy-equivalent noise in the cell. The signalto-noise thresholds for the cluster formation are not changed with respect to the settings given in Ref. [3]. However, the noise in the calorimeter increased due to the presence of multiple proton-proton interactions, as discussed in Sect. 2.2, and required the adjustments explained below. While in ATLAS operations prior to 2011 the cell noise was dominated by electronic noise, the short bunch crossing interval in 2011 LHC running added a noise component from bunch-to-bunch variations in the instantaneous luminosity and in the energy deposited in a given cell from previous collisions inside the window of sensitivity of the calorimeters.",

The implicit noise suppression implemented by the topological cluster algorithm discussed above leads to significant improvements in the calorimeter performance for e.g. the energy and spatial resolutions in the presence of pile-up.

Only clusters with positive energy are considered. The topo-clusters are initially reconstructed at the EM scale [61,[65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72], which correctly measures the energy deposited in the calorimeter by particles produced in electromagnetic showers. A second topo-cluster collection is built by calibrating the calorimeter cell such that the response of the calorimeter to hadrons is correctly reconstructed. This calibration uses the local cell signal weighting (LCW) method that aims at an improved resolution compared to the EM scale by correcting the signals from hadronic deposits, and thus reduces fluctuations due to the non-compensating nature of the ATLAS calorime-ter. The LCW method first classifies topo-clusters as either electromagnetic or hadronic, primarily based on the measured energy density and the longitudinal shower depth. Energy corrections are derived according to this classification from single charged and neutral pion MC simulations. Dedicated corrections address effects of calorimeter noncompensation, signal losses due to noise threshold effects, and energy lost in non-instrumented regions close to the cluster [3]. Figure 3 shows an overview of the ATLAS calibration scheme for calorimeter jets used for the 2011 dataset, which restores the jet energy scale to that of jets reconstructed from stable simulated particles (truth particle level, see Sect. 5.5). This procedure consists of four steps as described below.",

This constitutes a qualitative departure from the behaviour of the pile-up history contribution in the central region of ATLAS, where this  out-of-time pile-up leads to systematically increasing signal contributions with increasing \u03bc.

The Tile calorimeter has a unipolar and fast signal shape [20]. It has little sensitivity to out-of-time pile-up, with an approximate shape signal baseline of 150 ns.

If a third jet is produced in the same hard-scatter proton-proton interaction, the balance between the leading (in p T ) two jets is affected. To enhance the number of events in the sample that have this 2 \u2192 2 topology, selection criteria on the azimuthal angle \u03c6(jet1, jet2) between the two leading jets, and p T requirements on additional jets are applied. Table 1 summarises these topology selection criteria. In addition, all jets used for balancing and topology selection have to originate from the hard-scattering vertex, and not from a vertex reconstructed from a pile-up interaction. For this, each jet considered is evaluated with respect to its jet vertex fraction (JVF), a likelihood measure estimating the vertex contribution to a jet [3]. To calculate JVF, reconstructed tracks originating from reconstructed primary vertices i = 1, . . . , N PV are matched to jets using an angular matching criterion in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space of R < 0.4 with respect to the jet axis. The track parameters calculated at the distance of closest approach to the selected hard-scattering vertex are used for this matching. For each jet, the scalar sum of the p T of these matched tracks, i , is calculated for each vertex i contributing to the jet. The JVF variable is then defined as the p T sum for the hard-scattering vertex, 0 , divided by the sum of i over all primary vertices. Any jet that has |\u03b7 det | < 2.5 and JVF > 0.6 is classified as \"vertex confirmed\" since it is likely to originate from the hard-scattering vertex.",

In the most forward region at low p T , the matrix method tends to give a slightly higher relative response compared to the central reference method (see Fig. 10a). However, the same relative shift is observed both for data and MC simulations, and consequently the data-to-MC ratios are consistent. The matrix method is therefore used to measure the relative response as it has better statistical precision. Figure 11 shows the relative response obtained using the matrix method as a function of the jet pseudorapidity for data and MC simulations.  [3], the Herwig++ MC generator predicts a higher relative response than Pythia for jets outside the central reference region (|\u03b7 det | > 0.8). Data tend to fall in-between the two predictions. This discrepancy was investigated and is observed both for truth jets built from stable particles (before any detector modelling), and also jets built from partons (before hadronisation). The differences therefore reflect a difference in physics modelling between the event generators, most likely due to the parton showering. The Pythia predictions are based upon a p T -ordered parton shower whereas the Her-wig++ predictions are based on an angular-ordered parton shower.",

The residual correction is held fixed for pseudorapidities larger than those of the most forward measurements included (|\u03b7 det | \u2248 2.4). All jets with a given p T and |\u03b7 det | > 2.4 will hence receive the same \u03b7-intercalibration correction. The kernel-width parameters used 8 are found to capture the shape of the data-to-MC ratio, but at the same time provide stability against statistical fluctuations.

Conversely, the dependence of the MPF technique on the jet algorithm is relegated to a secondorder effect. 10 Thus, in the following, when presenting the results from the MPF technique, no jet algorithm is in general explicitly mentioned. The event selection used in this analysis is basically the same as that described in Ref. [3] for the 2010 analysis, except for changes that are either to adapt to the higher instantaneous luminosity of the 2011 dataset or to the different detector conditions. The event selection proceeds as follows: 4. The leading photon must pass strict identification criteria [86], meaning that the pattern of energy deposition in the calorimeter is consistent with the expected photon showering behaviour. 5. The leading photon must lie in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37, meaning it is fully contained within the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter. 6. Jets with high electromagnetic content (e.g., jets fluctuating to a leading \u03c0 0 , with \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 ) may be misidentified as photons. In order to reduce this background, the leading photon is required to be isolated from other activity in the calorimeter. The isolation variable (E \u03b3 Iso T ) [86] is computed in a cone of size R = 0.4 around the photon, and corrected for pile-up energy inside the isolation cone. Only photons with E \u03b3 Iso T < 3 GeV are selected. 7. The photon reconstruction algorithm attempts to retain photons that have converted into an electron-positron pair. While clusters without matching tracks are directly classified as \"unconverted\" photon candidates, clusters matched to pairs of tracks originating from reconstructed conversion vertices are considered as \"converted\" photon candidates (double-track conversions). To increase the reconstruction efficiency of converted photons, conversion candidates where only one of the two tracks is reconstructed (single-track conversions) are also retained. Jets that are misidentified as photons fall more often in the category of converted photons, because fake photons produce wider showers and have tracks associated to them. To suppress this background further, the ratio of the transverse energy of the photon candidate cluster to the scalar sum of the p T of the matching tracks (E",

This purity is lower than that measured in the 2010 analysis [3], due to the larger number of pile-up events in the 2011 data. The effect of pile-up is tested by measuring the purity under the same high and low pile-up conditions used to estimate the uncertainty on the response due to pile-up (see Sect. 6). Variations in the purity of the order of 5-10 % are found. The systematic uncertainty on the purity measurement is not taken into account in the estimation of the uncertainty due to background events, because it becomes negligible when multiplied by the relative response difference between the signal and background events. The same purity estimate is used for MPF and DB, since both techniques have the same photon selection.

The residual pile-up effect on MJB is checked by comparing the MJB values using sub-samples of data and MC simulations with different N PV and \u03bc values.

For this purpose, each uncertainty component is propagated separately from each in situ method to the combined result. This is achieved by coherently shifting all the correction factors obtained by the in situ methods by one standard deviation of a given uncertainty component, and redoing the combination using the same set of averaging weights as in the nominal combination.

            "text": "The in situ techniques usually rely on assumptions that are only approximately fulfilled. One example is the assumption that the calibrated jet and the reference object are balanced in transverse momentum, while this balance can be altered by the presence of additional high-p T particles. In order to determine the JES uncertainties, the modelling of physics effects has to be disentangled from detector effects. These effects can be studied by looking at the changes of the datato-MC response ratios introduced by systematic variation of the event selection criteria. The ability of the MC simulation to describe these changes under large variations of the selection criteria determines the systematic uncertainty in the in situ methods, since physics effects can be suppressed or amplified by these variations. In addition, systematic uncertainties related to the selection, calibration and modelling of the reference object need to be considered. When performing the variations of the selection criteria, only statistically significant variations of the response ratios are propagated to the systematic uncertainties. This is achieved by evaluating the systematic uncertainties in intervals which can be larger than the bins used for the measurement of the response ratios, meaning that several bins are iteratively combined until the observed deviations are significant. By doing so, one avoids multiple counting of the statistical uncertainties in the systematics that are evaluated. Using this approach, it is found that the radiation suppression uncertainty for the \u03c6(jet, \u03b3 ) cut on the MPF method (see Sect. 10.4.2) can be dropped. 14 For the relative \u03b7-intercalibration described in Sect. 7.1 the dominant uncertainty source is due to MC modelling of jets at forward rapidities, where properties differ significantly for the generators under consideration (Pythia and Herwig). Other systematic uncertainty sources arise due to the modelling of the jet resolution, the trigger, and dijet topology selection. However, these components are negligible when compared to the MC modelling uncertainty.",

In this combination, the ability of the MC simulation to describe the data, the individual uncertainties of the in situ techniques and their compatibility, are considered.

The last residual uncertainty could in principle be treated either as correlated or as uncorrelated between the p T bins. It is observed that treating this uncertainty source as uncorrelated in p T provides a better approximation of the correlation matrix. This is expected, as this residual uncertainty source includes many orthogonal eigenvectors with small amplitudes and many oscillations, hence the small correlations. The original exact covariance matrix is thus decomposed into a part with strong correlations and another one with much smaller correlations. It is this residual uncertainty source that incorporates the part with small correlations. Figure 40 shows the obtained five eigenvectors \u03c3 k V k and the residual sixth component, as a function of the jet p T . The p T -dependent sign of these eigenvectors allows to keep track of the (anti-)correlations of each component in different phase-space regions. This is necessary for a good description of the correlations of the total JES uncertainty. These six nuisance parameters are enough to describe the correlation matrix with sufficient precision at the level of percent. As explained above, the quadratic sum of these six components is identical to the quadratic sum of the original uncertainties shown in Fig. 37. In the high-p T region above 300 GeV, one eigenvector has a significantly larger amplitude than all the others, see the black curve in Fig. 40, hence the strong correlations between the bins. Approximately 60-80 % of this component is due to the photon and electron energy scale uncertainties up to about 700 GeV (see Fig. 37c and d), while some other uncertainties contribute to it at higher p T .",

[3]. In this method, jets are treated as a superposition of energy deposits of single particles. For each calorimeter energy deposition within the jet cone, the type of the particle inside the jet is determined, and the expected mean shift and the systematic uncertainty of the calorimeter response between data and MC simulation is evaluated. The corresponding uncertainty is derived from in situ measurements or systematic MC variations. This deconvolution method is described in Refs. [3,4] and is used for the derivation of the JES uncertainty for the ATLAS 2010 data analysis. Measurements of the calorimeter response to pions in the combined test-beam [89] are used for pions with momenta between 20 and 350 GeV. 17 Single isolated hadrons with momenta up to 20 GeV are selected in a minimum bias sample produced in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV taken in 2011 and the calorimeter energy (E) in a narrow cone around an isolated track is compared to the track momentum ( p) (see Refs. [4,90] for more details). Effects from the noise thresholds and from the calorimeter acceptance are estimated by comparing the energy measured in calorimeter cells to the one measured in topo-clusters. In addition, the uncertainty on the absolute electromagnetic energy scale is considered and the response uncertainty of protons, anti-protons and neutral hadrons is evaluated using different hadronic shower models, again as described in Refs. [4,90]. For hadrons with p > 400 GeV, for which no measurements are available in the combined test-beam, the uncertainty is conservatively estimated as 10 % to account for possible calorimeter non-linearities or longitudinal leakage.",

            "text": "The mean E/ p is well described by the MC simulation for p > 6 GeV. However, for lower momenta (1 p < 6 GeV) the data are shifted down with respect to the MC simulation by about 4 %. This is in contrast to the 2010 measurement, where an agreement within 3 % is found [4]. The worse data-to-MC agreement is due to the new corrections in the absolute electromagnetic energy scale obtained in situ using the Z boson mass constraint reconstructed from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 , the increased topo-cluster thresholds, and the use of a new Geant4 version. Figure 43a shows the estimated calorimeter jet response ratio between data and MC simulation as estimated from the single-hadron response measurements as a function of the jet transverse momentum. A lower calorimeter response to jets in data than in the MC simulations is observed (black circles), consistent with that obtained using in situ techniques. The uncertainty on this ratio is about 4 % at very low and very high p T . It decreases to about 2 % between 100 \u2264 p T < 600 GeV. The individual uncertainty components are also shown. The dominant uncertainties at low p T are those from noise threshold effects, which can be different for single isolated hadrons and hadrons inside jets. At high p T the response differences between data and MC simulation as measured in the ATLAS combined test-beam and the uncertainty for hadrons with p > 400 GeV are largest. The uncertainty on the global electromagnetic energy scale and the response uncertainty for neutral hadrons contribute about 1 %. Figure 43b compares the JES uncertainty as obtained from single hadron response measurements to the one obtained from the in situ method based on the p T balance between a jet and a well-measured reference object. For both methods the mean jet calorimeter response in data is observed to be shifted down by about 2 % with respect to the one in the MCsimulated events. However, the p T balance methods give a considerably smaller uncertainty.   Fig. 43 Relative calorimeter jet response ratio between data and MC simulations, as estimated from the single-hadron response measurements as a function of the jet transverse momentum, is shown in a. The total systematic uncertainty together with the uncertainty from the individual components is shown as a lighter band. The black circles denote the estimated mean shift of the calorimeter response to jets in data over the one in MC simulations. In b, the uncertainty from the single-hadron response measurements is shown as a lighter (yellow) band, while the JES uncertainty, as derived from the in situ methods based on p T balance, is shown as a dark (gray) band. The closed markers denote the estimated shift of the calorimeter response to jets in data over the one in MC simulations, and the line shows the JES correction derived from the p T balance in situ methods",

The presence of dense signals from the jet increases the likelihood that small pile-up signals survive the noise suppression applied in the topological clustering algorithm, see Sect. 5.1. As the core signal density of jets increases with p T , the acceptance for small pile-up signals thus increases as well. Consequently, the pile-up signal contribution to the jet increases. This jet p T dependence is expected to approach a plateau as the cluster occupancy in the core of the jet approaches saturation, which means that all calorimeter cells in the jet core survive the selection imposed by the noise thresholds in the topo-cluster formation, and therefore all pile-up scattered into these same cells contributes to the reconstructed jet p T .

The ratio of the average track-jet p T between the non-isolated and isolated track jets p non-iso T / p iso T in bin of the calorimeter p T , is used to quantify the uncertainty in the response to track jets. This comparison is shown in Fig. 50a as a deviation from unity of the data-to-MC ratio:  Fig. 50 In a, the deviation from unity of the data-to-MC ratio of the track-jet p T for non-isolated jets divided by the track-jet p T for isolated jets, is shown as a function of the jet p T . The deviation from unity of the data-to-MC ratio of the relative response of non-isolated jets with respect to that of isolated jets as a function of the jet p T is shown in b. As described in the text, the distributions show the ratios given in a Eq. 16  (16) to quantify the uncertainty in the response to track jets in the small R min range of R \u2264 R min < R + 0.1. The A track jet close-by has a strong R min dependence, especially at small R min range where the close-by jet overlaps the probe jet, and the dependence is more significant for jets with R = 0.6. The agreement between data and MC simulations improves with increasing R min . The calorimeter jet response relative to the matched track jet (r calo/track jet ) is investigated as a function of p T , in terms of the non-isolated jet response relative to the isolated jet response r calo/track jet non\u2212iso/iso , for data and MC simulations. The datato-MC ratio A close\u2212by of r calo/track jet non\u2212iso/iso is shown in Fig. 50b as the deviation from unity for the range of R \u2264 R min < R+0.1. As already seen in the track-jet response in Fig. 50a, there is a strong R min dependence on A close\u2212by within the small R min range mentioned above. The deviation of A close\u2212by from unity is added in quadrature with the track-jet response uncertainties obtained above to get the overall JES uncertainties due to close-by jet effects. The convoluted uncertainty is about 3.5 % (10 %) at R min < 0.5 (0.7) for R = 0.4 (0.6) jets with p T = 30 GeV, and becomes smaller than 1 % at R min above 0.8 for both sizes of jets.

However, the calorimeter response to jets also exhibits variations that can be correlated to the flavour of the partons (i.e., light or heavy quarks, or gluons) produced in the sample under study. This dependence is to a large extent due to differences in fragmentation and showering properties of jets loosely labelled as originating from a light quark or a gluon. In this section, the dependence of the jet energy scale on whether a jet originates from a light quark or a gluon is studied. Also, a systematic uncertainty that accounts for the sample dependence of the jet energy scale is established using different MC simulations. In addition, jet properties that can be shown to discriminate between jets initiated by light quarks and gluons are used to build a light-quark/gluon tagger [3,94]. The focus in this section is on understanding how the JES is affected by a selection based on the light-quark/gluon tagger, and the implications for the sampledependent systematic uncertainty described if jets are tagged using this tagger. Details of the procedure to built a quarkgluon tagger can be found in Ref.",

Even more so, the Global Sequential (GS) calibration introduced in Ref. [3], which can be applied on top of the (standard) EM+JES or LCW+JES calibration, or just to jets at the EM scale as done for the studies discussed here, shows the best performance at low p T .

Comparisons between Pythia and Herwig++ provide an estimate of the impact of differences in the modelling of the parton shower, fragmentation and hadronisation for generators modelling the jet fragmentation well within the constraints provided by data. The differences in the response between these two models are large, while the effect of the underlying event tune is small, as can be seen by comparing the standard Pythia MC11 tune with the Perugia2011 tune.",

To adjust the MC simulations to the btagging performance in data, a dedicated b-tagging efficiency correction [91] is applied to the simulation and the related systematic uncertainties are evaluated.",

This is possible in 2011 because in situ jet energy scale corrections and uncertainties exist which are already accounting for a potential mis-modelling of the dead material in the MC simulation. The uncertainty component derived from the propagation of single-particle uncertainties to jets is also removed, while it contributes 0.5 % in 2010 data.

Differences in the calorimeter response, caused by the different particle spectra, can also impact the r trk measurement in certain MC simulations and should not be part of the uncertainty, since such shifts are measurable in the data. The r trk distribution is, thus, calculated from the various samples described in Sect. 3 using p truth T in the denominator, even though only small differences are observed in most samples when including calorimeter effects, i.e. using the jet p T reconstructed with the calorimeters ( p calo T ). In the top pair analysis, differences between MC@NLO and POWHEG+Herwig are considered as process or generator systematic uncertainties. Fragmentation and decay systematic uncertainties are evaluated taking the difference between Pythia and Herwig. In the dijet analysis, differences between Pythia and Herwig++ set the systematic uncertainties from uncertainties in the decay models. The updated fragmentation tune in Herwig++ prevents this comparison from being a conservative measure of the b-jet fragmentation systematic uncertainties. These are evaluated using comparisons to the Bowler-Lund . The systematic uncertainty on the tracking efficiency for isolated tracks increases from 2 % (|\u03b7 track | < 1.3) to 7 % (2.3 \u2264 |\u03b7 track | < 2.5) for tracks with p T > 500 MeV.

Tracking in jet core High track densities in the jet core influence the tracking efficiency due to shared hits between tracks, fake tracks and lost tracks. The number of shared hits is well described in the MC simulation. The p T carried by fake tracks is negligible.

In particular, the study of the b-tagging efficiency in a sample of b-jets decaying semileptonically to muons [91] requires a correction that maps the all-particle jet energy scale of that sample to that of an inclusive sample of b-jets. This correction and its systematic uncertainties are estimated in this section. The correction also has applications beyond the b-tagging calibration since it can also be used to improve the reconstruction of b-jets identified as semileptonic. The study of the all-particle energy scale in this section is performed independently of the study of the calorimeter energy scale, even though the two are not straightforward to decouple in in situ studies. Figure 56a shows the all-particle response for an inclusive jet sample, a sample of b-jets tagged with the MV1 algorithm and a sample of b-jets containing a muon from a semileptonic b decay. The semileptonic b-jets sample is selected using hadron-level information, and no b-tagging is imposed. However, the muon is required to pass kinematic and quality cuts detailed in Ref. [91]. The effect of neutrinos is clearly visible in both the tagged b-jets sample and more significantly in the semileptonic b-jets sample. The increase at low p T in the semileptonic sample arises from biases created by the muon kinematic cuts.",

The tag jet is selected such that it hits a fully operating part of the ATLAS calorimeter and is inside a central \u03b7 region (|\u03b7| < 1.6). Jets in the gap between Tile Long Barrel and Tile Extended Barrel (i.e. jets with axes pointing to the region 0.8 \u2264 \u03b7 < 1.2) are excluded. The probe jet is chosen such that its axis points to the vicinity of the non-operating Tile module. Only probe jets with 0.1 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 0.8 are used. Figure 58 shows the jet response of the probe jet in the region of a missing Tile module and in the neighbouring regions for events where the average jet p T of the two leading jets is between 300 and 400 GeV. A decrease of the probe jet response by about 15 % is observed in the region with the non-operating Tile calorimeter module when no correction is applied. This reduces to only about 10 % for the cell-based correction. However, an overcorrection by about 10 % is observed in the vicinity of the region with the missing Tile module. The correction based on the jet shape performs much better. There is no overcorrection in the vicinity of the problematic module and the probe jet energy is compensated much better if the jet axis falls into the module. There is only a small overcorrection by a few percent in the vicinity of the non-operating module.",

The procedure to estimate those uncertainties 19 is detailed in Sect. 18. Figures 61 and 62 show the flavour response uncertainty and the flavour composition uncertainties for light jets in an event sample with top-quark pairs decaying semileptonically. Semileptonic decays are selected in the MC simulation samples based on truth information, and electrons are not considered as jets when estimating the jet response. The MC generator used to evaluate the sample response and the gluon fraction is MC@NLO, while the gluon fraction uncertainty is derived using the difference in gluon fractions between the ACERMC and POWHEG generators. The average gluon fraction uncertainty ranges from 2 to 10 % depending on the jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. For differential measurements, the gluon fraction and its uncertainty can also be determined as a function of the property measured (e.g. number of jets). Figure 65 shows the total uncertainty for b-jets in the case of jets with R = 0.4 calibrated using the EM+JES and LCW+JES schemes. Figures 63 and 64 show the flavour uncertainties for an event sample of inclusive jets. The sample response and gluon fraction are evaluated using the Pythia nominal sample, while the gluon fraction uncertainty is derived considering the average difference in the fraction of gluons between the Pythia nominal sample and samples producing using the POWHEG (interfaced with Pythia for parton showering and hadronisation) and the Herwig++ generators.

In the low-p ref T region (17 \u2264 p ref T < 35 GeV), it is obtained by a maximum likelihood fit applied to the distribution of the p jet T / p ref T ratio. The function used, hereafter denoted as the \"fit function\", is a Poisson distribution extended to non-integer values 9 and multiplied by a turn-on curve to model the effect of the p jet T threshold, as depicted in Fig. 15a. For a given [ p ref,min T , p ref,max T ] bin, the turn-on curve is equal to 1 above 12 GeV/ p ref,min T and equal to 0 below 12 GeV/ p ref,max T . A linear function is used to interpolate the turn-on between these two values. The mean value of the underlying Poisson distribution is taken as the mean p T balance. A fit is preferred to an arithmetic mean calculation because of the jet p T cut, which biases the mean value of the balance 9 This continuous Poisson function is obtained by extending the discrete Poisson distribution to real values by replacing the factorials in the discrete Poisson function with Euler's Gamma function. This function has only one free parameter (\u03bb). A linear transformation of the x-scale (x = a * x) is introduced and the mean and width of this function are expressed in terms of \u03bb and a.",
