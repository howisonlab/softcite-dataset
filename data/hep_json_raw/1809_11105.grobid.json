A search for W R boson and N R neutrino production in a final state containing two charged leptons and two jets ( jj) with = e, \u00b5 is presented here. The exact process of interest is the Keung-Senjanovi\u0107 (KS) process [10], shown in figure 1. When the W R boson is heavier than the N R neutrino (m W R > m N R ), the on-shell W R mass can be reconstructed from the invariant mass of the jj system, whereas, when m N R > m W R , the on-shell W R mass can be reconstructed from the invariant mass of the jj system. Only ee and \u00b5\u00b5 lepton pairs, coupling respectively to N e R and N \u00b5 R , are considered as part of the jj final state, since no mixing between flavours is assumed. Left-and right-handed weak gauge couplings are also defined to be equivalent (g L = g R ).",

            "text": "In the minimal LRSM containing the type-I seesaw mechanism [6][7][8][9], N R neutrinos are Majorana particles. The type-I seesaw mechanism accounts for the masses of the SM neutrinos by linking (heavy) N R neutrinos and the SM neutrino masses through a mixing matrix. In this case, both the SM neutrinos and the hypothetical N R neutrinos are required to be Majorana particles, allowing lepton-number-violating processes, such as the KS process, to occur. In LRSM variants, including the inverse seesaw mechanism [11][12][13][14], N R neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac particles 1 (referred to in this paper as \"Dirac\" particles for simplicity). For simple versions of LRSMs containing the inverse seesaw mechanism, lepton-number-violating processes are not expected [16]. The Majorana or Dirac nature of the N R neutrino can be established by comparing the charges of the two final-state leptons. If the N R neutrinos are Dirac particles, the leptons will always have opposite-sign (OS) charges. However, if they are Majorana particles, the N R neutrinos are their own anti-particles, and their decay will give rise to an experimental signature of both oppositeand same-sign (SS) dileptons in a 50%-50% admixture.",

No evidence of a W R boson or a N R neutrino has emerged from these studies. The current most stringent exclusion limits on W R boson and Majorana N R neutrino masses are derived by the CMS experiment [21] at \u221a s = 13 TeV, in both the electron and muon channels, regions extending to m W R \u223c4.4 TeV (for a range of m N R values) are excluded, whilst the m N R limits reach \u223c2.9 TeV in the electron channel (for m W R \u223c3.8 TeV) and \u223c3 TeV in the muon channel (for m W R \u223c3.6 TeV). The analysis presented here extends the ATLAS searches to 36.1 fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s =13 TeV and also provides lower limits on the masses for the Dirac case of the N R neutrino. The crosssection of the KS process varies, depending on the masses of the W R boson and the N R neutrino, from a few pb to about 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 pb for high-mass signal points at the end of the sensitivity of this analysis. The analysis uses a new MadGraph generator model [24,25] which overcomes known limitations of Pythia [26] as employed in previous searches by ATLAS and CMS, and also allows the exploration of the scenario in which the N R neutrino is heavier than the W R boson for the first time.",

The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and straw-tube transition-radiation tracking detectors. A new innermost layer of pixel detectors [28,29] was installed prior to the start of data taking in 2015. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic energy measurements with high granularity and cover |\u03b7| < 3.2. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The MS surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroidal magnets ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.7 and fast detectors (|\u03b7| < 2.4) for triggering. A two-level trigger system [30] is used to select events for offline physics analyses. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by the software-based high-level trigger, reducing the event rate to about 1 kHz.",

Signal regions (SR) are designed to contain the majority of expected signal events and are used to extract the signal yields. Control regions (CR) and validation regions (VR) are defined by reversing some of the SR event selection criteria and are used to constrain and validate background predictions respectively. The analysis region selection criteria are summarised in table 2. To suppress background from Z + jet(s) processes in the SR(e \u00b1 e \u2213 ), SR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ), SR(e \u00b1 e \u00b1 ) and SR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ) signal regions, the invariant masses of the two leptons (m ) and the two jets (m jj ) must be larger than 400 GeV and 110 GeV, respectively. In addition, the scalar p T sum of the selected two leptons (E T for electrons) and the two most energetic jets (H T ) must be larger than 400 GeV to further reject the SM background, which exhibits lower transverse energies than the signal. Since the expected event yields in the OS channel are larger than those in the SS channel, the CR and VR definitions differ slightly, as shown in table 2. The variable used to ensure the orthogonality between CRs, VRs and SRs is m , except in the CR(e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) which has the same kinematic selection as the SRs, but with different-flavour leptons. The CR(e \u00b1 e \u2213 ) and CR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) provide a high-purity sample of Z + jet(s) events and are used to constrain the yields from this process. Similarly, the CR(e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) is used to constrain events from top-quark processes. For the SS channel, the main prompt SM background is diboson production and its yield is constrained in both the CR(e \u00b1 e \u00b1 ) and CR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ).

They are selected using single-lepton triggers and must satisfy low missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) requirements, to suppress W + jet(s) production where a real lepton from a W boson decay is present. One charged lepton and at least one (two) jet(s) must be present in the event in the muon (electron) channel. Furthermore, contamination from prompt leptons in fake-enriched regions is subtracted using simulated events. This contamination is up to 40% in the electron channel, and in the muon channel for p T (< 100 GeV), while it becomes dominant for high p T muons. The selection criteria for the electron fake-enriched region are designed to mimic as much as possible the signal region selection in order to ensure a similar composition of various sources of fake electrons: decays of light-flavour hadrons into light leptons, photon conversions, and jets faking electrons. In the muon channel, the major source of fake muons originates from decays of heavy-flavour hadrons and the muon fake-enriched region is optimised to maximise the number of such events. The fake-factors are parameterised in terms of lepton flavour (e or \u00b5), E T (p T ) for electrons (muons), and \u03b7. For electrons, they vary from 0.3 to 0.5 in the barrel region and from 0.4 to 0.9 in the endcap region. For muons, they are about 0.4 for p T < 50 GeV and rise to 1.0 for p T > 50 GeV.",

The uncertainty related to the charge misidentification probability of electrons arises from the statistical uncertainty of both the data and the simulated samples of Z + jet(s) events used to measure this probability. The uncertainty ranges between 10% and 20% as a function of the electron E T and \u03b7. Next, the uncertainty on the fake estimation arises from the unknown composition of fakes, as well as from statistical uncertainty and prompt lepton subtraction used to derive F in the fake-enriched regions. The uncertainty due to the composition of fakes is estimated by varying the criteria to select the nominal sample for the fake-factor measurement (table 3). In the electron channel, the E miss T requirement is increased to <100 GeV, the two-jet requirement is dropped and one jet recoiling against the electron (analogous to the nominal muon fake-factor measurement) is required. In the muon channel, the nominal |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 and E miss T requirements are varied up and down respectively by one unit and 10 GeV. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the yield of prompt leptons from W and Z boson decays is estimated by varying the total SM prediction of the simulated samples by \u00b110% in the muon channel and \u00b130% in the electron channel. These values represent the size of the uncertainty due to the choice of QCD renormalisation (\u00b5 r ) and factorisation (\u00b5 f ) scales, \u03b1 S , and PDF uncertainties. The different size of the uncertainty between channels arises from the different fake-enriched region definitions (table 3), requiring exactly one jet and at least two jets for the muon and electron channels respectively. The total uncertainty in the fake-factors ranges between 10% and 50% across all E T (e, \u00b5) and \u03b7 bins for both flavours.",

Observed and predicted event yields and the corresponding uncertainties of the dominant backgrounds in all analysis regions are presented in tables 5, 6 and 7. The information on observed and expected yields, along with their ratio for pre-(black filled markers) and post-fit (red hollow markers) yields, is presented in figure 3 in all the analysis regions. The CR(e \u00b1 e \u2213 ) and CR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) are used to extract the yield of Z + jet(s) background, as the purity is above 95%. The CR(e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) is mostly populated by top-quark background events (80% purity) and used to extract their normalisation. In the SS channel, the Z + jet(s) contribution is estimated to be \u223c33%, determined in a fit using the CR(e \u00b1 e \u00b1 ) only, and with the diboson normalisation factor free to vary. The data-driven fake background normalisation is fixed, which allows for the measurement of the Z + jet(s) normalisation despite its low contribution in the control region.",

When performing the CR+SR fit to obtain the upper limit on the signal strength, the nuisance parameters are constrained both in CRs and SRs. For example, the SS diboson normalisation is constrained using both CR(e \u00b1 e \u00b1 ) and CR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ). This diboson normalisation factor is validated in the VR(\u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ), as shown in figure 5(f), where the expected background and observed number of events agree within the uncertainties. In the fit, the Majorana and the Dirac case are distinguished by using both the OS and SS regions or only the OS regions, respectively. The SR distributions after the CR+SR fit are shown in figure 6. No significant deviation from the SM predictions is observed in any of the signal regions. The most significant local excess is observed in the m jj spectrum of the e \u00b1 e \u2213 channel, with a \u223c2\u03c3 local significance (\u223c1\u03c3 global significance) between 3.5 and 4 TeV. After the fit, the compatibility between the data and the expected background is assessed. The global p-values for the background-only hypothesis are 0.67 and 0.62 for the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 and \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 channels respectively and 0.16 and 0.59 for the e \u00b1 e \u2213 and \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channels. Upper limits at 95% CL are calculated for the KS process cross-section using the CL s method [73] and the profile likelihood-ratio [74] as the test statistic. Exclusion limits are calculated in separate fits for the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels since there is no theoretical requirement that N e R and N \u00b5 R have the same mass. When setting exclusion limits for the two models the Dirac case is assumed to give twice as many OS events as the Majorana case. Results are shown in figure 7 for both Majorana and Dirac N R neutrino cases. In both cases, W R bosons with masses up to 4.7 TeV are excluded at 95% CL, for m N R in the 0.  to overlap, resulting in a rapidly changing sensitivity and narrow 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 uncertainty bands in the exclusion limit plot, as visible in figures 7(a) and 7(c). Figure 8 shows the exclusion limits separately for the OS and SS analyses in the Majorana N R neutrino case. The two analyses generally exhibit a similar sensitivity across the two-dimensional mass plane. Under the inverted hierarchy hypothesis (m N R > m W R ) the SS analysis is more sensitive due to the lower expected background (figures 6(b), 6(d), 6(e) and 6(f)).",

No evidence of W R bosons or Majorana or Dirac heavy neutrinos, N R , is found assuming the KS production and lower limits are set on the m W R and m N R masses, assuming equality of left-and right-handed weak gauge couplings (g L = g R ). The excluded region for the Majorana N R neutrinos extends to about m W R = 4.7 TeV, for m N R = 1.2 TeV in the electron channel and for m N R = 1 TeV in the muon channel.

In the low-mass regime (m W R < 1.5 TeV), under the hierarchy hypothesis m N R > m W R , N R masses up to 1.5 TeV are excluded at 95% CL. These results improve upon previous ATLAS searches [19] and extend the exclusion limits on m W R by 1-2 TeV. Additionally, the scenario in which the N R neutrino is heavier than the W R boson is explored for the first time.",
