However, penguin processes are also possible, and they may have amplitudes large enough to influence the results. Here we use (-) B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays to set limits on possible changes due to penguin contributions. This mode has both tree and penguin diagrams, as shown in Fig. 1. Theoretical models, to be discussed later, predict that the ratio of penguin to tree amplitudes is greatly enhanced in this decay relative to (-) B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K 0 S [3,4]. Thus, the effects of penguin topologies can be investigated by using the J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay and comparing differ- 1 CP violation measurements in (-) B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K 0 S determine the sum of 2\u03b2 \u2261  B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c1 0 (770). 2 Next, we discuss the time-dependent decay rate, taking into account that the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system is composed of the resonances previously reported in Ref. [5]. This analysis largely follows the measurement procedure used in the study of CP violation in (-) B 0 s decays into J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [6]. The total decay amplitude for (-) B 0 at a decay time of zero is taken to be the sum over individual \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 resonant transversity amplitudes [7], and possibly one non-resonant amplitude, with each component labeled as A i ( A i ).

Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [16]. The trigger [17] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage that applies a full event reconstruction [17]. Events selected for this analysis are triggered by a J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay, where the J /\u03c8 meson is required at the software level to be consistent with coming from the decay of a (-) B 0 meson by use of either of IP requirements or detachment of the J /\u03c8 meson decay vertex from the primary vertex. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [18] with a specific LHCb configuration [19]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [20], in which final state radiation is generated using Photos [21]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector and its response are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [22] as described in Ref. [23]. \u2212 candidate is reconstructed by combining a J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidate with two pions of opposite charge. The like-sign combinations J /\u03c8\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 are also reconstructed for background studies. The event selection is described in detail in the time-integrated amplitude analysis [5]. The only difference here is that we reject K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates by excluding the events in the region within \u00b120 MeV of the K 0 S mass peak.",

This is accomplished by combining the J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidate with a pair of pion candidates of opposite charge, and then testing if all four tracks form a common decay vertex. Pion candidates are each required to have p T greater than 250 MeV, and the scalar sum of the two transverse momenta, p T (\u03c0 + ) + p T (\u03c0 \u2212 ), must be larger than 900 MeV. To test for inconsistency with production at the PV, the IP \u03c7 2 is computed as the difference between the \u03c7 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered track. Each pion must have an IP \u03c7 2 greater than 9. Pion and kaon candidates are positively identified using the RICH system. The four-track B 0 candidate must have a flight distance of more than 1.5 mm, where the average decay length resolution is 0.17 mm. The angle between the combined momentum vector of the decay products and the vector formed from the positions of the PV and the decay vertex (pointing angle) is required to be less than 2.5 \u2022 . Events satisfying this preselection are then further filtered using a multivariate analyzer based on a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) technique [24]. The BDT uses eight variables that are chosen to provide separation between signal and background. These are the minimum of DLL(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 ) of the \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 , p T (\u03c0 + ) + p T (\u03c0 \u2212 ), the minimum of IP \u03c7 2 of the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , and the B 0 properties of vertex \u03c7 2 , pointing angle, flight distance, p T and IP \u03c7 2 , where DLL(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 ) is a logarithm of the likelihood ratio between \u03bc and \u03c0 hypotheses for the muon candidates.",

We use both opposite-side (OS) [28] and same-side pion (SS\u03c0 ) tagging information; here we use the same procedure as for same-side kaon tagging used in [27], but identify the tag from a pion rather than a kaon. The wrong-tag probability \u03b7 is estimated based on the output of a neural network trained on simulated data. It is calibrated with data using flavor-specific decay modes in order to predict the true wrong-tag probability of the event B 0 meson, which has a linear dependence on \u03b7. The calibration is performed separately for the OS and the SS\u03c0 taggers. If events are tagged by both OS and SS\u03c0 algorithms, a combined tag decision and wrong-tag probability are given by the algorithm defined in Ref. [28]. This combined algorithm is implemented in the overall fit. The effective tagging power obtained is characterized by \u03b5 tag D 2 = (3.26 \u00b1 0.17)%, where D \u2261 (1 \u22122\u03c9 avg ) is the dilution, \u03c9 avg is the average wrong-tag probability for \u03c9 and \u03c9, and \u03b5 tag = (42.1 \u00b1 0.6)% is the signal tagging efficiency.",
