We used 1.93 fb \u22121 of data collected by the KLOE experiment at the DA NE \u03c6-factory. No structures have been observed over the irreducible \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 background. A 90% CL limit on the ratio \u03b5 2 = \u03b1 /\u03b1 between the dark coupling constant and the fine structure constant of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 -2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 has been set in the dark photon mass region between 519 MeV and 973 MeV.

            "text": "Many gravitational anomalies observed since the first decades of the twentieth century, as well as large-scale structure formation in the early Universe, can be explained by the existence of a non-baryonic matter known as dark matter (DM) [1]. Dark matter motivates extending the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) to include a dark sector consisting of fields and particles with no SM gauge charges and including extra gauge symmetries. The minimal extension of the SM consists of just one additional abelian gauge symmetry U D (1) with associated a light vector gauge boson, the dark photon -known also as U boson, \u03b3 or A -as mediator of the new force, called for this reason dark force. In the simplest scenario [2], the coupling with SM particles arises from a vector portal known as kinetic mixing consisting in loops of heavy dark particles charged under both the electromagnetic and the dark force. The portal allows the mixing of the dark photon belonging to the U D (1) group with the SM photon of the U em (1) symmetry introducing the Lagrangian term:",

Through the portal the U boson can couple to the electromagnetic current with a strength proportional to the SM particles electric charge. The process is responsible for both production and decay of the dark photon in SM interactions thus resulting in an \u03b5 2 suppression.

The U signal should appear as a peak in the invariant mass of the final state particles with a width mainly dominated by the invariant mass resolution since the expected U -decay width can be considered negligible [5]. KLOE already investigated e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh (dark Higgsstrahlung) [6], U boson in decays of vector particles to pseudoscalars [7,8], and the visible decay hypothesis publishing three searches for radiative U production in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 U \u03b3 process, with the U boson decaying into: a) \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [9], using 240 pb \u22121 of data; b) e + e \u2212 [10], using a sample of 1.54 fb \u22121 ; c) \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [11] analyzing the whole KLOE data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.93 fb \u22121 . Searches for muon and pion pairs, with the ISR photon selected at small an- In the present work we extend the statistics of the U \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 search to the whole data sample and update the analysis with a new estimate of the background, analogous to the one used for the U \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 search. The new search confirms no U -boson signal in the dimuon invariant mass spectrum: a new 90% CL exclusion limit in \u03b5 2 is estimated. This limit is of comparable magnitude with respect to the previous ones, thus a combined search of dark photon decays into both muon and pion pairs would increase the sensitivity of the single channel searches, particularly, it is more effective in the region of the \u03c1-\u03c9 interference where the search for U \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 loses sensitivity.",

The procedure requires as inputs the invariant mass data spectrum, the background (the irreducible \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 background), the U -boson signal and the systematic fractional uncertainties on the background estimation for each M \u03bc\u03bc bin. The signal has been generated with a toy MC in steps of 2 MeV for the U -boson mass. At each step, a Gaussian distribution is built with a width corresponding to the invariant mass resolution of the dimuon system of about 2 MeV. The signal is then integrated over M \u03bc\u03bc around M U . The number of signal events, given as input to the procedure, is initially arbitrary and very high (about ten times the square root of the estimated background value in the corresponding mass bin) and then iteratively scaled until the confidence level CL S reaches 0.1 within \u00b1 0.01. The integral of the signal corresponding to the defined level of confidence represents the limit on the number of U -boson events excluded at 90% CL. Since the limit is strongly dependent on the irreducible background evaluation, the limit extraction accounts for the systematic uncertainties of the background estimate. The limit extraction procedure uses the total bin-by-bin fractional systematic uncertainty, reported in Fig. 7, to perform a Gaussian smearing of the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 expected background given as input.",

As for the previous analyses, we use the CL S technique to estimate a 90% CL limit for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 U \u03b3 ISR , U \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process. To extract the limit, we use the already estimated background and observed spectra for both \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 [11] and \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 channels in a combined way. A total systematic error on the irreducible background estimate, given by the combination of the corresponding estimated uncertainties for both U -boson decay modes, is also given as input to the procedure. A combined U -boson signal is generated for both decay channels taking into account the differences in global efficiency and relative branching ratio [3]. The signal inputs are generated with the same toy MC procedure performed for the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 limit extraction, then, each signal is integrated and normalized to the number of events estimated from Eq. (3), for a given hypothesis of the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5 2 . The limit computation proceeds according to the following steps: it makes a hypothesis of the \u03b5 2 kinetic mixing parameter, starting from an arbitrary very low value; the corresponding number of events for \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 channels are generated according to Eq. (3) in order to build the signal input histogram, then, the procedure runs as before by comparing data and expected irreducible background. The search procedure ends when the estimated CL S becomes close to 0.1 within \u00b10.01, providing directly the corresponding exclusion on \u03b5 2 .",
