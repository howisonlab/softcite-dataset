Besides the Standard Model interpretation, various possibilities for extended Higgs sectors are being considered. The minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) features two Higgs doublets resulting in five physical Higgs bosons, which are subject to direct searches. Alternatively, more generic Two-Higgs Doublet models (2HDM) are used for the interpretation of results. The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM) has a more complex Higgs sector with seven physical states. Also exotic Higgs bosons decaying to invisible final states are considered. This article summarizes recent findings based on results from collider experiments.",

The discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV 1,2 by the experiments ATLAS 3 and CMS 4 at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an important milestone, and it is of fundamental interest to study the properties of this state, its quantum numbers and couplings. An equally important aim is the unravelling of the overall structure of the Higgs sector. While at the level of current measurements, the observed state is compatible with the Higgs boson as predicted by the SM, the mass of the Higgs boson is divergent at high energies 5 . For many other open questions, related e.g. to dark matter, naturalness and CP violation in the universe, solutions might evolve through more detailed studies of the Higgs sector. From investigation of the observed boson alone one obtains relatively weak contraints on Higgs decays beyond the Standard Model (BSM); for example, a study of the CMS experiment ( Figure 1) 6 derives an upper limit of 52% for the branching fraction into BSM decay modes at 95% confidence level. Significant improvement of such limits can at least be expected to take a long ",

            "text": "While the SM features a single complex Higgs doublet resulting in one physical scalar Higgs boson, the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) is characterized by an extended Higgs sector with two complex Higgs doublets. This gives rise to five physical Higgs bosons, three of them neutral, labeled h, H (CP-even) and A (CP-odd) and jointly referred to as \u03c6, and the other two charged, named H \u00b1 . At tree level, the MSSM Higgs sector is governed by two parameters: the mass m A and tan \u03b2, which is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. Beyond tree level, additional parameters enter via radiative corrections, and benchmark scenarios fixing these parameters are used to compare different measurements. In many cases, the m max h benchmark scenario 7 is used. The mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson is usually approximately degenerate with one of the CP-even bosons, either the H for large m A , or the h if m A is small. With the exception of the di-muon channel, this degeneracy cannot be resolved within the experimental mass resolution, and thus the visible cross section effectively doubles. The coupling to the b quark is proportional to tan \u03b2. Thus production cross sections in association with b quarks are enhanced by a factor of \u2248 2 tan 2 \u03b2. It is important to note that the observation of a Higgs boson near 125 GeV with SM-like properties does not exclude additional heavy Higgs bosons at large tan \u03b2, as discussed in detail in Ref.

Events containing identified electrons or muons with transverse momenta above 15 GeV or 10 GeV, respectively, are vetoed. These vetoes suppress background events and ensure that the channels are statistically independent. Two \u03c4 had candidates with oppositesign charges are required, one passing the tight \u03c4 had identification requirements and the second passing the medium criteria.

It is addressed with an embedding technique: events with reconstructed Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays are taken from the data, and the muon objects are replaced with simulated \u03c4 decays. Additional backgrounds arise from Z \u2192 ee(\u00b5\u00b5) decays, tt and di-boson production, QCD multijet and W+jets events.

The combinations of all \u03c4 \u03c4 and \u00b5\u00b5 channels are shown. The difference in the exclusion limits obtained for the gluon-fusion and the b-associated production modes is due to the different sensitivity from the b-tagged samples. The results from the various event categories and decay patterns are combined, and are used to compute upper limits on the MSSM parameter tan \u03b2 at the 95% confidence level as a function of m A . The ATLAS analysis also includes the \u03c6 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channel, which is not discussed here in detail. The results are shown in Figure 3 in the m max h scenario. At low masses (below m A \u2248 250 GeV), the upper limit on tan \u03b2 reaches down to values of 5, and touches the lower limit obtained by the LEP experiments. At larger m A , there is still a wide range of tan \u03b2 allowed. Inclusion of the full set of 8 TeV data can be expected to give further improvements in the sensitivity of both experiments.",
