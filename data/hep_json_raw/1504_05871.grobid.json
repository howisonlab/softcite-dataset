Two new analysis techniques to reject surfaceevent backgrounds were applied to the 612 kg days germanium-detector WIMP-search exposure. An extended analysis was also completed by decreasing the 10 keV analysis threshold to \u223c5 keV, to increase sensitivity near a WIMP mass of 8 GeV/c 2 . After unblinding, there were zero candidate events above a deposited energy of 10 keV and 6 events in the lower-threshold analysis. This yielded minimum WIMP-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross-section limits of 1.8\u00d710 \u221244 and 1.18\u00d710 \u221241 cm 2 at 90% confidence for 60 and 8.6 GeV/c 2 WIMPs, respectively. This improves the previous CDMS II result by a factor of 2.4 (2.7) for 60 (8.6) GeV/c 2 WIMPs.",

These reduced-charge ERs originate from three major sources: electrons produced by \u03b2 emitters on or near the detector surfaces, electrons ejected from photons scattering in nearby material, and photons that interact near the detector surfaces. All of these mechanisms can lead to events in which an energy deposition is observed in only a single detector, producing \"surface events\" that can be mistaken for single-interaction NRs. The long-lived 222 Rn daughter 210 Pb, implanted in the detector surfaces and their copper housings, is the primary source of such surface events. This class of events constitutes the dominant background for the CDMS II WIMP search and presents a considerable challenge [37]. Fortunately, recoils near detector surfaces are characterized by prompt phonon absorption in the TESs. Consequently, the phonon signals for surface ERs are (on average) faster than for NRs in the detector's bulk, enabling surface-event background discrimination based on phonon-pulse timing. The event selection criteria derived from phonon timing (called \"timing cuts\") presented here are essential to obtaining optimal WIMP sensitivity for the CDMS II data set because they mitigate the surfaceevent background, improving the overall ER rejection to > 10 6 .",

Radiogenic neutrons produced outside the shielding have too little energy to cause a detectable NR after penetrating the polyethylene.

Furthermore, 5 of the 19 Ge detectors were omitted from the analysis because of readout channel failures across all data sets. This gives a direct analogy to the original analysis of this data set, which used the same detector subset. Ionization channels are read out by a low-noise JFET circuit with an operating temperature of \u223c150 K [45]. Phonons are detected by quasiparticle-trap-assisted electrothermalfeedback transition-edge sensors (QETs). The QET signal is amplified by SQUIDs that are thermally coupled to the cryostat's 600 mK cold stage [45]. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the ZIP channel layout.

In Ge the value of is approximately 3.0 eV/pair for ERs [48]. The \"ionization yield\" (or yield) is defined as the ratio of ionization energy to recoil energy (E q /E r ) and we require this quantity to be unity for ERs (see below). An NR will produce less ionization than an ER of equal recoil energy. This effect is well known [49] and provides the basis for the ZIP detector's primary method of ER/NR discrimination. For recoil energies between 10 and 100 keV in Ge, the NR ionization yield varies between 0.2 and 0.3. Using the 133 Ba calibration data, the charge and phonon amplitudes were calibrated so that the energies of known gamma lines are reproduced and the yield is unity for ERs. Specifically, the charge channels were calibrated using the 356 keV line after an \u223c10% correction to the ionization amplitudes to account for small systematic variations with interaction location (within the detector). We do not fully understand the origins of the systematic variation with interaction location, though it is empirically robust. One possibility is that the detectors are not neutralized uniformly by the infrared (940 nm) LED that is activated between data-taking periods to remove trapped charge. The relative phonon-channel calibration was performed by scaling the phonon-channel amplitude fractions -the amplitudes of individual channels divided by the sum of the amplitudes -to have equivalent distributions. Finally, the summed phonon energy was calibrated by requiring the ionization yield to be unity on average for ER events in the 65-100 keV region.",

This delay smearing affects lower-ionization events more than higher-ionization events. In particular, NRs that deposit energy in a single detector (\"single scatters\") are more susceptible than the (higher-ionization) low-yield ERs used to quantify the expected leakage of surface events into the signal region. The OFX inaccuracy made only a small contribution to the previously published limit, and background estimates were adjusted upward in the original result to account for the resulting larger uncertainties at low energies [33]. Nevertheless, the number and character of the candidate events provides useful information on the possibility of a signal. It is very likely that the candidate event featured in Fig. 3 would have been removed by the timing cut in the original work had the ionization delay at the global minimum of the \u03c7 2 been chosen, but using the improved OFX procedure also has the potential to cause previously excluded events to become WIMP candidates.",

The Soudan Underground Laboratory also houses a neutrino detector, MINOS, to measure properties of the \"NuMI\" neutrino beam originating from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory [55]. While it is very unlikely for CDMS to observe any beam-induced events, the loss of live time incurred by removing all time periods coincident with a NuMI beam spill is negligible. The NuMI neutrino-beam cut is implemented as a restriction on the live time, removing events within 60 \u00b5s of the arrival of the neutrino beam's 10 \u00b5s spills. After application of these cuts, 612 kg days of total exposure remain. We define this as our \"raw exposure.\" Out of a total of 36% loss of live time (64% data-taking efficiency) the largest contributors were bad environmental configurations (\u223c15%), failed KS tests (\u223c8%), cryocooler noise (\u223c6%), poor phonon reconstruction (\u223c4%), and fundamental hardware failures (\u223c3%).

            "text": "The event-level class of quality cuts consists of several components. A \"glitch\" cut removes events that have phonon pulses resembling electronic noise in the phonon readout chain. These events are typically correlated across multiple detectors and are characterized by phonon pulses with fall times shorter than the timescale expected for phonon dissipation. Such events are less likely to appear in the ionization readout chain; consequently, they are effectively removed with a cut that rejects events in which the phonon pulse multiplicity is significantly larger than the ionization pulse multiplicity [56]. The muon-veto cut uses the 2\" thick scintillator panels that surround the CDMS II experiment and the following two rejection criteria: an event was removed if (1) a ZIP event is associated with a muon-like energy deposition (0.58 V or \u223c3.8 MeV deposited) in any veto panel occurring between 185 \u00b5s before and 20 \u00b5s after the ZIP trigger time, or (2) there is any veto activity above the scintillator-panel hardware threshold (\u223c0.23 V) and within the 50 \u00b5s before a ZIP trigger. Both criteria are used for the muon-veto cut because it makes the cut stronger and has only about a 2% efficiency loss across all recoil energies. Finally, because WIMPs will not interact in more than one detector within a given event, we defined a \"single-scatter\" cut to select events involving a single ZIP detector as follows: (1) the phonon signal must be greater than six standard deviations above the mean electronic-noise level in the detector under consideration; and (2) the signal in all other detectors must be within four standard deviations of the means of their respective noise distributions. Ionization channels were used for multiple-scatter rejection for those detectors with degraded phonon channel performance. Thus, Ge and Si detectors that are not part of the WIMP-search exposure were still live with respect to identification and re-jection of multiple-scatter events. The single-scatter cut efficiency for each detector was estimated from the fraction of randomly triggered events (i.e., electronic noise) that satisfy criterion (2). The combined efficiency of the glitch, muon-veto and singles cuts varies by detector and over time, and ranges from 96% to 98%. Another aspect of the singles cut is its use to select certain samples from calibration data. For example, multiple-scatter events that have their secondary scatter in the detector above or below the triggering detector are said to be \"facetagged.\" For these events the primary recoil is biased toward the direction facing the multiples tag. When using the multiples in background estimations, separating the events by face helps decrease the systematic uncertainties (see Sec. VII A). Sometimes events with multiples toward the phonon readout side are called \"phononside\" and those with multiples toward the charge readout side are called \"charge-side.\"",

A charge-pulse reconstruction-quality cut was also defined, requiring the \u03c7 2 value of the OFX fit to be less than an energy-dependent threshold. This cut selects events with high-quality charge energy estimators, suppressing those with excess electronic noise or the occurrence of multiple pulses within a single event trace (referred to as \"pile-up\").

An NR \"band\" was derived for each detector by fitting the distribution of NR yields in 252 Cf calibration with a Gaussian hypothesis in bins of recoil energy. The collections of best-fit Gaussian means and widths were then fit with energy-dependent functional forms, giving smooth parameterizations versus recoil energy of the average yield and the yield resolution for NRs. The functional form for the means was inspired by the Lindhard theory [57] (y = a \u2022 E b r , where a and b are fitted parameters), whereas the widths are fit to a power law below a fitted energy threshold and a constant above [58]. ER bands were similarly constructed from 133 Ba calibration. The primary ionization-yield cut requires that events be located within the \u00b12\u03c3 width of the NR band. By construction, the selection efficiency is \u223c95% and roughly constant with energy (see Fig. 4). Variations in detector response over the course of the WIMP search caused slight variations in each detector's NR and ER bands. Consequently, the bands depend on both detector and time.

III). The sum is approximately the optimal combination of these two variables, as can be seen in Fig. 6. A timing cut is defined as a set of detector-dependent thresholds on the distributions of this parameter, below which all events are rejected. The thresholds were determined by an optimization scheme that approximately maximizes the sensitivity to a WIMP with a mass of 60 GeV/c 2 . Practically, this was accomplished by maximizing the WIMP-search exposure (as measured with 252 Cf NRs) while keeping the total leakage approximately equal to a \"target\" leakage of \u223c0.5 events. This approximately maximized the 60 GeV/c 2 WIMP sensitivity while keeping the total expected leakage well under 1 event [60].",

The surface-event background estimates for the 3 timing-cut strategies are described in detail in Sec. VII A. Although the quality cuts remove most unusual events, data-reconstruction artifacts occasionally result in events with extreme kinematic quantities (\"outliers\"). To prevent such outliers from skewing the timing-cut optimization, a consistency cut rejects events for which \u03c4 + t del is greater than 32 \u00b5s or \u03c4 -t del falls outside the 0.5% and 99.5% quantiles of the combined 133 Ba and 252 Cf data sets. Fig. 6 shows the classic timing cut in the delay versus rise-time plane, and Fig. 7 shows the cut in the yield versus timing-parameter plane for an example detector [61]. Applying this timing cut results in a total SAE summed over detectors of 220 kg days between 10 and 100 keV for for a 60 GeV/c 2 WIMP and an expected surface-event leakage of 0.64 (+0.17 -0.15) stat events, cal-culated after unblinding.

Principal component analysis is a statistical method for determining a unitary transformation that takes N possibly correlated input vectors and returns N output vectors that are linear combinations of the input vectors (N = 4 in this case). The output vectors are ordered by their statistical variance, so that the output vector with the i th -highest variance is called the i th principal component.  input vectors were normalized to zero mean and unity variance so that the ordering of statistical variances of the output vectors is meaningful in an absolute sense. Neural-network computational complexity scales poorly with the number of input parameters. Therefore, only the first two principal components (i.e., those with the highest variance) were selected as inputs for the neural network. Given input parameters with similar intrinsic resolution and physical relevance, the high variance combinations will be those that maximally separate the distinct populations (i.e., NRs and ER surface events). Principal components were selected separately for each detector and for several bins of time spanning the WIMP-search data set. The latter is necessary to capture changes in detector performance caused by variations in operating conditions. The principal component rotation showed that all four timing parameters contribute significantly to the first and second principal components in most cases. This generally indicates that the use of the extra parameters (as compared to the classic analysis) is beneficial even though in the end the sensitivity change is not dramatic (see Sec. VIII A).",

While the surface-event leakage is worse for the extendedthreshold analyses, for low WIMP masses sensitivity improves considerably because of the steeply rising WIMP spectrum. Simple extensions to the three timing analyses were accomplished by lowering the thresholds, confirming the cut efficiencies below 10 keV, and re-evaluating the surface-event leakage estimates.

The results are then fit with an empirical functional form with a low-energy fall off similar to the error function.

Signal events were hidden by removing the singlescatter events in the NR yield band. This technique is effective for removing bias in the timing-cut preparation, but restricts the information that can be used for estimating surface-event leakage before unblinding has occurred. For this reason the leakage estimates were done before and after the unblinding, but consistency between the two methods is checked.

The s ij are the fractions of N i in subset j, which are calculated using the surface-event multiples in the NR band for the WIMP-search data. The 14 detectors used in this analysis were split into two detector sets according to their positions in the tower: the 12 interior detectors, and 2 \"endcaps,\" on the top or bottom of a stack of six detectors. Equation 10 was applied to each detector set separately because endcaps require additional systematic uncertainty corrections (discussed below). The M ij and m ij are determined independently for three different event sets: (1) NRMS in WIMP-search data, (2) WBMS in WIMPsearch data, and (3) WBMS in 133 Ba calibration data. For representative surface-event populations drawn from outside the NR band, the index j specifies one of six subsets constructed from two detector faces (see Sec. IV B on face-tagging) and three energy bins (10-20 keV, 20-30 keV, and 30-100 keV). In the case where M ij and m ij were drawn from the NRMS WIMP-search data, the six event subsets were combined for each detector because of the low statistics, reducing the index set for j to one element.

WIMP-search multiple scatters below the ER mean -5\u03c3 line and above the NR mean +2\u03c3 line (WBMS) is one of our typical background samples, but because the ER mean -5\u03c3 and NR band lines cross there is an implicit energy threshold in this background sample. The signal region, however, is taken to be the NR band above the 3\u03c3 charge threshold and below the ER mean -3\u03c3 line. This leaves a small region (see Fig. 5) that is unaccounted for in the background estimates. The estimate is nevertheless useful because (1) the implicit backgroundestimation threshold can be as low as \u223c5 keV, very near the signal-region threshold in most cases, and (2) the limits are calculated without background subtraction so a conspicuous rise in the WIMP upper-limit would exist if there were a large leakage present in the unaccounted region.",

It is also the first post-222 Rn \u03b1-decayer after the long-lived 210 Pb. These facts make this decay likely to be an important long-lived contamination, and because a recoiling 206 Pb nucleus could have produced an energy deposition below \u223c100 keV with an ionization yield consistent with being an NR, it makes sense to evaluate this background very seriously.",

Therefore the most important component of the background comes from surfaces that are uninstrumented or those that are adjacent to uninstrumented surfaces. Another important point is that since the alphas from this decay give such a clear signature, and the decay is a two-body decay, an obvious way to estimate the number of unaccompanied (single) 206 Pb events is to estimate the number of unaccompanied \u03b1 events from the decay. The angular distribution is isotropic and any surface that can observe a single \u03b1 is approximately equally likely to observe a single 206 Pb recoil. This estimation of the number of single 206 Pb events was carried out, and using rough estimations for the passage fractions of these events when subjected to the other analysis cuts, we expect approximately 0.187 signal-region 206 Pb events over the whole exposure.",

Yellin's optimum interval method [77] allows derivation of an upper limit on a signal rate in cases with unknown background. While the backgrounds in our signal region are not completely unknown, this is a conservative approach to setting upper limits on a possible signal. This presentation also requires assumptions about the WIMP distribution in the galactic halo, the type of interaction between WIMPs and nucleons, and the nuclear form fac- tor for the interaction. The velocity distribution was assumed to be Maxwellian and was parameterized by the rotational velocity at infinite radius and corrected for the finite galactic escape velocity [49], which is taken to be 544 km/s [78]. A WIMP mass density of 0.3 GeV/c 2 /cm 3 was used for historical reasons, making the computed limits comparable to similar publications [49]. Some recent astrophysical measurements indicate different values [79]; a correction for such deviations is a simple multiplicative factor and can be easily applied by the reader [80]. A most probable WIMP velocity of 220 km/s was used along with a mean circular velocity of the Earth with respect to the galactic center of 232 km/s. The WIMP in-teractions were assumed to be spin-independent and the Helm form factor was used [49] for a natural Ge isotopic distribution.",

Relative to the original publication, the ionization-based fiducial volume and phonon timing cuts have improved efficiencies in the analysis reported here, leading to the improved exposure and more stringent limits. In terms of the overall spectrumaveraged detection efficiency for a 60 GeV/c 2 WIMP, the classic timing-cut strategy (see Sec. V A) shows a 12% improvement over the previously published version, about half of which can be attributed to a reoptimization of the ionization-based fiducial volume following the data reprocessing. A similar improvement was seen for the neuralnetwork timing-cut analysis (described in Sec. V B). The largest improvement of 29% in overall SAE efficiency was achieved for the 5d-\u03c7 2 analysis (described in Sec. V C), owing primarily to an increased timing-cut efficiency in the 15-90 keV energy range (see Sec. V E).",

The 5d-\u03c7 2 set weaker limits for low-mass WIMPs because the cut was set to maximize sensitivity to a WIMP with mass 60 GeV/c 2 . This combined with the fact that the 5d-\u03c7 2 method could set a very tight cut at low energies (it used an independent 10-20 keV bin whereas the other analyses were less granular) produced a poorer WIMP efficiency toward low recoil energies despite the lower expected background leakage at those energies, but excellent sensitivity for high WIMP masses.",

For example, the 5d-\u03c7 2 analysis has a high efficiency at moderate recoil energies (30-60 keV), but has a stringent timing cut at lower energies. It is well suited to provide the strongest limits at high WIMP mass (>60 GeV/c 2 ), but will produce fewer low-energy signal-region events. On the other hand, the classic analysis at 10 keV threshold shows a slight weakening of the 90% CL limit for WIMP masses below about 18 GeV/c 2 , where sharp increases in the limit curves indicate systematics near threshold. The neural-network timing cut has been identified as a robust method with the highest signal efficiency at low energies (see Fig. 10) and good sensitivity at lower WIMP mass (\u2264 9 GeV/c 2 ). The classic extended-threshold limit rules out about half of the silicon 68% C.L. region obtained in a previous CDMS II publication [39]. This indicates that the low-threshold results from the Ge detectors are marginally compatible with the Si-detector measurements taken during the same data period, under standard assumptions. Comparisons of such direct detection results on different nuclei will be a powerful tool for understanding WIMP dark matter both in terms of the fundamental WIMP interactions [86,87] and possible backgrounds.",

(Top panel) The 10 keV threshold analyses. The 5d-\u03c7 2 limit (blue dashed) is the \"primary\" high-threshold result to be quoted from this work. The neural-network and classic limits are shown as red dot-dashed and black solid lines respectively. (Bottom panel) The extended-threshold limits, focused on the lower WIMP-mass region. The same color code applies except that all of the analyses from this work correspond to the extended-threshold versions. The classic limit (black solid) is the \"primary\" extended-threshold result to be quoted from this work. The extended 5d-\u03c7 2 limit shown corresponds to the timing-cut optimization assuming a 60 GeV/c 2 WIMP mass. For comparison, the previous CDMS II low-threshold limit is shown[34] (green triple-dot-dashed).",
