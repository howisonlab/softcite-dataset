            "text": "One of the main goals of the ANTARES telescope (Ageron et al. 2011) is the detection of cosmic neutrinos and the identification of their sources. Neutrinos only interact via the weak interaction and are stable, making them unique probes to study the high-energy universe. The production of high-energy neutrinos has been proposed (Halzen & Hooper 2002;Bednarek et al. 2005;Stecker 2005) for several kinds of astrophysical sources in which the acceleration of hadrons may occur. In the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with matter or radiation, charged pions are produced. The decay of these charged pions yields neutrinos and muons. The subsequent decay of the latter produces in turn more neutrinos. While CRs, except at ultra high energies, are deflected by galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields, neutrinos point back to their sources. Therefore, the detection of neutrinos may give valuable information on the origin of CRs. It would also settle the question of the hadronic versus leptonic mechanism in several sources from which highenergy gamma rays have been observed (Berezhko et al. 2008).",

The information on the time and position of the detected photons is used to reconstruct the muon trajectory, which is correlated with the direction of the incoming neutrino. Other signatures are also possible, such as the cascades produced in the CC interactions of electron and tau neutrinos and in the neutral current interactions of all neutrino flavors. In this analysis muons induced by high-energy neutrinos are used. For these events, the detector acceptance is large due to the long muon range and the neutrino direction is derived with an accuracy of a fraction of a degree.",

The detector is located at (42\u00b048/ N, 6\u00b0 10' E) at a depth of 2475 m, in the Mediterranean Sea, 40 km from the French town of Toulon. It comprises a three-dimensional array of 885 optical modules (OMs) looking 45\u00b0 downward and distributed along 12 vertical detection lines. An OM (Amram et al. 2002) consists of a 10 inch photomultiplier (PMT) housed in a glass sphere together with its base, a special gel for optical coupling and a //-m etal cage for magnetic shielding. The OMs are grouped in 25 triplets (or storeys) on each line, except for one of the lines on which acoustic devices are installed (Aguilar et al. 2011b) and which therefore contains only 20 optical storeys. The total length of each line is 450 m; these are kept taut by a buoy located at the top of the line. The lower 100 m are not instrumented. The distance between triplets is 14.5 m and the separation between the lines ranges from 60 to 75 m. The lines are connected to a central junction box, which in turn is connected to shore via an electro-optical cable. Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the detector.",

For this analysis, two different filter algorithms were used to select the events. Both are based on the assumption that the optical background processes such as potassium-40 radioactive decays and bioluminescence are not correlated and induce single photoelectron hits. Hence, a first selection of the signal requires hits with a high charge (usually > 3 photoelectrons) or coincident hits within a time window of 20 ns on separate OMs of the same storey (LI hits). The first trigger requires at least five L \u00cd hits compatible with a muon track in any direction. The second trigger is defined as the occurrence of at least two L \u00cd hits in three consecutive storeys within a specific time window. This time window is 100 ns in the case where the two storeys are adjacent and 200 ns for next-to-adjacent storeys. In addition to the events selected by the trigger, the singles count rate of each OM is stored.",

The events are weighted according to the cross section and their probability to survive the passage through the Earth. If the neutrino interaction occurs near the detector, the hadronic shower resulting from the break-up of the target nucleon is simulated using GEANT (Brunner 2003). Otherwise, only the resulting muon is propagated to the detector using the M USIC code (Antonioli et al. 1997). Atmospheric muons reconstructed as upgoing are a source of background for a neutrino signal and their rejection is a crucial point in this analysis as will be described in Section 6. Downgoing atmospheric muons were simulated with the program MUPAGE (Carminati et al. 2008;Becherini et al. 2006) which provides parameterized muons and muon bundles at the detector.",

For the data sample in which the detector was operational with all 12 lines, the estimated angular resolution is 0.43 \u00b1 0.10 deg. The median of this angular error for the full data set considered in the analysis is shown in Figure 5 (right) as a function of the true neutrino energy. The systematic uncertainty on the angular resolution quoted above has been estimated by varying the hit time resolution, A\u00ed, in the simulation. Many possible effects can contribute to this resolution, including the PMT transit time spread, miscalibrations of the timing system and possible spatial misalignments of the detector. The hit time resolution directly impacts both the angular resolution and the number of events passing the quality criteria. Simulations using different A\u00ed values were compared with data in order to determine the best agreement in the lambda distribution, and was obtained for A\u00ed = 2.5 ns. This can be compared to the TTS of the PMT, which is 1.3 ns (standard deviation). Fiowever, the PMT time response is not Gaussian and the degraded resolution was found to partly account for the tails. A A\u00ed of 2.5 ns yields the quoted angular resolution of 0:46 and is the value used in the plots shown in this paper.",

The simulation of the signal is performed by adding events around the coordinates of the source, sampling in this case the angular distance of the event i to the source location from a three-dimensional distribution of the reconstruction error as a function of the declination and the number of hits. At this stage the systematic uncertainties on the angular resolution and on the absolute orientation of the detector are included by varying the simulated parameters of the events of each experiment, such as the zenith and azimuth angles, with the required uncertainty. An example of the distribution of the test statistic Q obtained by performing the search on a large number of pseudo-experiments for the full-sky search is shown in Figure 9 for the background only hypothesis and for experiments where several signal events are added to the background at a declination S = -70\u00b0.

The systematic uncer tainty on the acceptance is taken into account in the computation. background only case (jus = 0). A large value of Q indicates a better compatibility with the signal hypothesis.
