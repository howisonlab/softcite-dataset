            "text": "Production of seven pions in e + e \u2212 annihilation has not been studied before. A partial estimate of the cross section is possible from the BaBar measurement of the cross section of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 [1] reaction, based on the Initial-State Radiation (ISR) method. Using the well-known \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay rate, a contribution to the seven-pion cross section can be calculated. As a part of the total hadronic cross section, the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 0 is interesting for the calculations of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment [2][3][4]. The detailed study of the production dynamics can further improve the accuracy of these calculations and can help explain energy dependence of the cross section.",

These data were collected in four energy scans, about 50 c.m. energy points each, performed at the VEPP-2000 e + e \u2212 collider [5][6][7][8] in the 2011, 2012 and 2017 experimental runs. In the 2017 experimental run the beam energy has been monitored by the backscattering-laser-light system [9,10], providing an absolute energy measurement with better than 0.1 MeV uncertainty in every single measurement. In earlier runs beam energy has been determined https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.04.007 0370-2693/\u00a9 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The liquid xenon (LXe) barrel calorimeter with a 5.4 X 0 thickness has fine electrode structure, providing 1-2 mm spatial resolution [13], and shares the cryostat vacuum volume with the superconducting solenoid. The barrel CsI crystal calorimeter with a thickness of 8.1 X 0 is placed outside the LXe calorimeter, and the endcap BGO calorimeter with a thickness of 13.4 X 0 is placed inside the solenoid [14].

The E distribution of the event candidates after selection is shown in Fig. 2(a) by circles, while the histogram shows the remaining contribution of the six-pion events. The observed signal of six-pion events at each energy interval is used to normalize the MC simulation. We subtract this contribution from the experimental distribution of Fig. 2(a), and show the result in Fig. 2(b) together with the fit functions used to determine the number of seven-pion events and remaining background. The signal line shape is taken from the MC simulation of the sevenpion process, shown by the histogram, and is well described by the double-Gaussian function. All parameters of the signal function are fixed according to MC simulation at each energy interval except for the number of events and the main Gaussian resolution.

We have developed the primary generators for the seven-pion final-state production in the e + e \u2212 To obtain the detection efficiency, we simulate seven-pion production in the primary generators, pass simulated events through the CMD-3 detector using the GEANT4 [16] package, and reconstruct them with the same reconstruction software as experimental data. We calculate the detection efficiency from the MCsimulated events as a ratio of events after the selections described in Secs. 2, 3 to the total number of generated events. Fig. 4(b) shows the detection efficiency obtained for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c9 (squares) and for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7 (circles) intermediate states when the number of signal events is obtained from the fit of the E peak of Fig. 2(b). Due to the difference in the angular and momentum distributions of the pions, the efficiency for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7 intermediate state is lower compared to the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c9 model: about 10% and 13%, respectively. Variations of the dynamics or resonance parameters inside the initial \"vectorpseudo-scalar\" state for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7 production, and inside the \"scalar-vector\" state for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c9 production do not change the obtained detection efficiency by more than 3-5%. If we determine the number of the MC-simulated events using the \u03b7 and \u03c9 peaks from the histogram similarly to that in Fig. 3(a), the detection efficiency decreases additionally by 20-40% due to the | E| < 60 MeV requirement. These efficiencies are shown in Fig. 3(b) by triangles and up-down triangles for the 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7 and 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c9 states, respectively.",
