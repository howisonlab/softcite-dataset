            "text": "A statistical combination of several searches for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is presented. All searches use proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . In addition to the combination of previous searches, a targeted analysis requiring three or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented, focusing on the challenging scenario in which the difference in mass between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson. The results are interpreted in simplified models of chargino-neutralino or neutralino pair production. For chargino-neutralino production, in the case when the lightest neutralino is massless, the combination yields an observed (expected) limit at the 95% confidence level on the chargino mass of up to 650 (570) GeV, improving upon the individual analysis limits by up to 40 GeV. If the mass difference between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson in the chargino-neutralino model, the targeted search requiring three or more leptons obtains observed and expected exclusion limits of around 225 GeV on the second neutralino mass and 125 GeV on the lightest neutralino mass, improving the observed limit by about 60 GeV in both masses compared to the previous CMS result. In the neutralino pair production model, the combined observed (expected) exclusion limit on the neutralino mass extends up to 650-750 (550-750) GeV, depending on the branching fraction assumed. This extends the observed exclusion achieved in the individual analyses by up to 200 GeV. The combined result additionally excludes some intermediate gaps in the mass coverage of the individual analyses.",

It posits a new symmetry such that for each boson (fermion) in the SM, there exists a fermionic (bosonic) superpartner. Supersymmetry can potentially address several of the open questions in particle physics, including the hierarchy problem [9][10][11] and the unification of the gauge couplings at high energy scales [12,13]. If R-parity [14] is conserved, the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable and could be a potential dark matter candidate [15,16].",

            "text": "This paper focuses on searches for electroweak production of SUSY particles, under the assumption that the strongly-coupled SUSY particles are too massive to be directly produced. The superpartners of the bosons from the SM SU (2) and U(1) gauge fields before electroweak symmetry breaking are denoted as the winos and bino, respectively. We consider SUSY models assuming two complex Higgs doublets, and the superpartners of the Higgs bosons are denoted as higgsinos. The bino, winos, and higgsinos form mass JHEP03(2018)160 eigenstates of two charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 ) and four neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 ) and in general can mix among one another. In this paper, we focus on the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ), the next-to-lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 2 ), and the lightest chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ). If the superpartners of the SM leptons, the sleptons, are much heavier than the charginos and neutralinos, decays of the charginos and neutralinos proceed through the W, Z, and Higgs bosons. The branching fractions of neutralinos to the Z and Higgs bosons depend on the mixing among the bino, winos, and higgsinos to form mass eigenstates.",

At the LHC, several searches have been performed by the ATLAS [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] and CMS [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] Collaborations looking for direct production of charginos and neutralinos. Given the various possible decay modes, a SUSY signal could simultaneously populate multiple final states. This paper implements a statistical combination of the searches performed by CMS in refs. [38][39][40][41][42][43] covering several final states to improve upon the sensitivity of the individual analyses, particularly in models where the neutralino has a nonzero branching fraction to both Z and Higgs bosons. In addition, we present an extension of a search selecting events with three or more charged leptons [38]. It targets the difficult region of phase space where the difference in mass between the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 is approximately equal to the Z boson mass, and the signal has similar kinematic properties to the dominant background of SM WZ production.

In this paper, \"H\" refers to the 125 GeV scalar boson [48], interpreted as the lightest CP-even state of an extended Higgs sector. The H boson is expected to have SM-like properties if all of the other Higgs bosons are much heavier [49]. All signal models considered involve the production of two bosons (W, Z, or H) through SUSY decays, and we denote each model by the specific bosons produced. The W, Z, and H bosons are always assumed to decay according to their SM branching fractions. The sleptons are always assumed to have much higher masses than the charginos and neutralinos such that they do not contribute to the interactions. The first class of models assumes \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 production. The \u03c7 0 1 is assumed to be the LSP. The \u03c7 \u00b1 1 always decays to the W boson and the \u03c7 0 1 , while the \u03c7 0 2 can decay to either of the Z or H bosons plus the \u03c7 0 1 . We consider three choices for the \u03c7 0 2 decay: a branching fraction of 100% to Z \u03c7 0 1 (WZ topology), of 100% to H \u03c7 0 1 (WH topology), and of 50% to each of these two decays (mixed topology). This model is depicted in figure 1, showing the two possible decays. The production cross sections are computed in the limit of mass-degenerate winos \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 , and light bino \u03c7 0 1 , with all other sparticles assumed to be heavy and decoupled. The second class of models assumes \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 1 production. For bino-or wino-like neutralinos, the neutralino pair production cross section is very small, and thus we consider a specific gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) model with quasidegenerate higgsi-",

In this section, we present cross sections calculated to NLO accuracy [56] to demonstrate the dependence of the cross section values on assumptions made in decoupling other SUSY particles. The same qualitative conclusions also hold for the NLO+NLL calculations used in the final results.  . Cross section for \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 production at \u221a s = 13 TeV versus the wino mass, calculated to NLO accuracy in QCD with Resummino [56]. The \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 are assumed to be mass-degenerate winos. The various curves show different assumptions on the masses of the squarks and gluinos, as described in the legend. The green band shows the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section calculation, from the variation of renormalization and factorization scales as well as parton density functions, for the 100 TeV squark and gluino mass assumption. Figure 3 shows the NLO cross section for \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 production at \u221a s = 13 TeV assuming mass-degenerate winos \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 . The various curves show different assumptions on the masses of squarks ( q) and gluinos ( g), as described in the legend. The cross section depends significantly on the masses of the strongly coupled particles until they reach masses of at least 10 TeV. For the range of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 masses considered here, the reduction can make up to 90% in the cross section value. This is due to large destructive interference effects from t-channel diagrams involving squark exchange. The cross section calculation used in the interpretations of the analysis results assumes a mass of 100 TeV for the squarks and gluinos to have them fully decoupled. The obtained results would be less stringent if lower masses were assumed for the squarks and gluinos. We performed the same study for",

To select collision events, we require at least one reconstructed vertex. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex, where p T is the transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis. The physics objects are the objects returned by a jet finding algorithm [62,63] applied to all charged tracks associated with the vertex, plus the corresponding associated missing transverse momentum. The missing transverse momentum vector, p miss T , is defined as the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates projected onto the plane perpendicular to the proton beams. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . Events with possible contributions from beam halo processes or anomalous noise in the calorimeters can have large values of p miss T and are rejected using dedicated filters [64].",

Most SM background samples are produced with the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.2.2 or v2.3.3 generator [70] at leading order (LO) or NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD, including up to four additional partons in the matrix element calculations, depending on the process and calculation order. Other samples are produced with the powheg v2 [71,72] generator without additional partons in the matrix element calculations. Standard model WZ production in particular is modeled with MadGraph5 amc@nlo v2.2.2 at NLO precision for the search described in section 6, which requires a precise description of initial-state radiation (ISR). In other cases, powheg v2 is used. The NNPDF3.0 LO or NLO [73] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used in the event generation. Parton showering and fragmentation in all of these samples are performed using the pythia v8.212 [74] generator and the CUETP8M1 tune [75]. A double counting of the partons generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo and those with pythia is removed using the MLM [76] and the FxFx [77] matching schemes, in the LO and NLO samples, respectively. Cross section calculations at NLO or next-to-NLO [70,[78][79][80][81][82] are used to normalize the simulated background samples.",

This reweighting procedure is based on experimental studies of the p T of Z bosons [84]. The reweighting factors range between 1.18 (at p ISR T = 125 GeV) and 0.78 (for p ISR T > 600 GeV).

In each event, the four jets with the highest b tagging discriminator scores are considered to form dijet H candidates. There are three possible groupings to make two pairs of jets. The grouping is selected to minimize the difference between the invariant masses of the two dijet pairs, and the difference in masses is required to be less than 40 GeV. The average invariant mass of the two pairs is then required to be consistent with the mass of the H boson. Exclusive signal regions are defined based on the number of b jets (three or at least four) and multiple bins in p miss T . The primary background to this search comes from semileptonic decays in tt production, with smaller contributions from W or Z production in association with jets and from QCD multijet production. The backgrounds are predicted using data control samples that require either exactly two b jets or an average dijet invariant mass inconsistent with the H boson. The \"2 on-Z\" search [42], targeting the WZ, ZZ, and ZH topologies, selects events with exactly two opposite-sign, same-flavor (OSSF) leptons (e + e \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) consistent with the Z boson mass, at least two jets, and large p miss T . In the signal region targeting the WZ and ZZ topologies, two jets are required to have an invariant mass less than 110 GeV to be compatible with the W and Z boson masses, and events with b jets are rejected. To target the ZH topology, events are required to have two b jets with an invariant mass less than 150 GeV to be compatible with the H boson mass. Signal regions are defined with multiple exclusive bins in p miss T . The backgrounds fall into three categories. First, flavor symmetric backgrounds, such as tt production, yield e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 events at the same rate as e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events combined, and they are predicted from a data control sample of e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 events. Second, events with a Z boson and mismeasured jets give instrumental p miss T , and they are predicted from a data control sample of \u03b3+jets events. Third, events with a Z boson and at least one prompt neutrino, arising from processes such as WZ, ZZ, and ttZ production, are estimated using simulation.",

It targets the WZ topology where the mass difference between \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 is small such that the W and Z bosons are off-shell, and the observable decay products have low momentum. The leptons are required to satisfy 5 < p T < 30 GeV and have an invariant mass in the range 4 < m < 50 GeV, strongly suppressing SM backgrounds while retaining good acceptance for compressed signal scenarios. Additional kinematic requirements are applied to further reduce backgrounds, and the relevant signal regions are binned in m and p miss T . The largest backgrounds arise from Z/\u03b3 * and tt production, as well as misidentification of nonprompt leptons. The first two are predicted from simulation with constraints from data control regions, while the latter is predicted entirely using data. 5.5 Search for three or more leptons, and p miss T The \"\u22653 \" search [38] selects events with three or more leptons (e, \u00b5, and up to two \u03c4 h ) and large p miss T . Several exclusive categories are defined based on the number of leptons, lepton flavor and charge, the presence of an OSSF pair, and kinematic variables such as the invariant mass of the OSSF pair and p miss T . Events with a b jet are rejected to reduce the background from tt production. The various categories are designed to give this search sensitivity for a wide range of new physics models, including all of the topologies introduced in section 2. The best performance is seen in the WZ and ZZ models, while the lower branching fraction of the H boson to leptons reduces the sensitivity to other models. The SM backgrounds in this search vary across the categories, and the most important for the relevant regions in these interpretations are SM WZ and ZZ production, and events with misidentified nonprompt leptons. The former are predicted using simulation, which in case of WZ is validated in a set of dedicated control regions, while the latter are predicted entirely from data.",

Further backgrounds arise from misidentification of nonprompt leptons from processes like tt production, external and internal photon conversions, and rare SM processes such as triboson production, ttW, and ttZ. The contribution of the nonprompt lepton background is predicted using the \"tight-to-loose\" ratio method [89], which relies entirely on data. External and internal photon conversions as well as rare SM processes are predicted from simulation, and a dedicated data control region is used to constrain the normalization of the conversion background.",

The fraction of selected background events arising from SM WZ production in this region is approximately 86%. The validation of the p miss T and M T shape modeling is done using a data control sample enriched in W\u03b3 events, with the remainder of events coming mainly from W+jets production. A photon with p T > 40 GeV is required together with a lepton and p miss T \u2265 50 GeV, corresponding to a leptonic W boson decay. The minimum photon p T threshold ensures that the photon does not arise from final-state radiation. The motivation behind this selection is that the W boson M T distribution in both W\u03b3 and W+jets events is found to be consistent with that of SM WZ production. A systematic uncertainty is assigned to the signal region bins with high M T and p miss T based on the statistical precision of this control region.  Distributions of key kinematic observables for the events entering the search regions are shown in figure 5 with two representative signal mass points included. The data agree with the prediction within systematic uncertainties, which are dominated at high M T and p miss T by the WZ control region statistical precision as described above. This uncertainty is taken as correlated across signal region bins. The comparison between expected and observed yields in the search regions is shown in figure 6 and table 3. No significant deviations from the SM expectations are observed. The predicted background yields and uncertainties presented in this section are used as inputs to the likelihood fit for interpretation, described in section 7. The interpretation of the results in the WZ topology at 95% confidence level (CL) is presented in figure 7. Compared to ref. [38], the expected lower mass limit in the WZ corridor has improved from around (m \u03c7 0 2 , m \u03c7 0 1 ) = (200, 100) to around (225, 125) GeV, while the observed limit has improved by around 60     limit contour for signal points with m \u03c7 0 2 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 > m Z has also improved by as much as 25 GeV due to the new selections.

All searches considered here use proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No significant deviations from the standard model expectations have been observed. A targeted search requiring three or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) has been presented, focusing on chargino-neutralino production where the difference in mass between \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson, and no significant deviations from the standard model predictions are observed. This search is interpreted in a simplified model scenario of SUSY chargino-neutralino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 ) production with decays \u03c7 \u00b1",

For a massless LSP \u03c7 0 1 in the chargino-neutralino model, the combined result gives an observed (expected) limit in the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 mass of about 650 (570) GeV for the WZ topology, 480 (455) GeV for the WH topology, and 535 (440) GeV for the mixed topology. Compared to the results of individual analyses, the combination improves the observed exclusion limit by up to 40 GeV in the masses of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 in the chargino-neutralino model. The combination also excludes intermediate mass values that were not excluded by individual analyses, including \u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses between 180 and 240 GeV in the WH topology. In the GMSB neutralino pair model, the combined result gives an observed (expected) limit in the \u03c7 0 1 mass of 650-750 (550-750) GeV. The combined result improves the observed limit by up to 200 GeV in the mass of \u03c7 0 1 in the GMSB neutralino pair model, depending on the branching fractions for the SUSY particle decays.
