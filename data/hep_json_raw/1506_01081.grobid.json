The observed data are well described by the expected standard model backgrounds. Upper limits on the cross section of events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson candidate are also placed. Exclusion limits are presented for models of physics beyond the standard model featuring dark-matter candidates.",

The discovery of a Higgs boson [12,13] (H) creates a new opportunity to search for beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics giving rise to H \u00fe E miss T signatures [14,15]. In contrast to the aforementioned probes, the visible H boson is unlikely to be radiated from an initial-state quark or gluon. This has the important consequence that the H \u00fe E miss T signature directly probes the structure of the effective DM-SM coupling; see Fig. 1.",

One option is to use nonrenormalizable operators in an effective field theory (EFT), which is agnostic about the details of the theory at energies beyond the experimental sensitivity. Alternatively, simplified models that explicitly include the particles at higher masses can be used. The EFTapproach is more model independent but is not valid when the typical momentum transfer approaches the scale of the high-mass particles that have been integrated out. Simplified models do not suffer from these concerns but include more assumptions by design and are therefore less generic. The two approaches are thus complementary and both are considered here.",

The g \u00bc 4\u03c0 case overlaps with the no-truncation result. The blue line indicates regions that fail the perturbativity requirement of g < 4\u03c0, the red line indicates regions excluded by Z boson limits [53] on the invisible branching fraction (BF), and the pink line indicates regions excluded by the LUX Collaboration [54]. the mixing angle between the scalar S boson and the Higgs boson, and \u03ba is a scaling constant; however, current calculations [14] of the gg \u2192 HS production mode may be overestimated due to approximations made in evaluating the top-quark loop.",
