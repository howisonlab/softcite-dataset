This search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS detector at the LHC. No signal is observed, and a 95% confidence level upper limit of 847 fb is set on the cross section for standard model nonresonant Higgs boson pair production times the squared branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to a bb pair. The same signature is studied, and upper limits are set, in the context of models of physics beyond the standard model that predict modified couplings of the Higgs boson.",

Current determinations of the properties of the new particle by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations are found to be in agreement with standard model (SM) predictions [4,5]. However, there are still many measurements that could reveal unexpected deviations from the SM. A number of models of physics beyond the SM (BSM) can be tested using their predictions of the properties of the observed state, including the Higgs boson self-coupling and couplings to bosons and fermions [6][7][8][9][10].",

The HH production cross section predicted by the SM for 13 TeV proton-proton (pp) collisions and m H = 125.09 GeV [5,12] is 33.49 +4.3% \u22126.0% (scale) \u00b1 2.3%(\u03b1 S ) \u00b1 2.1%(PDF) fb [13][14][15][16][17], where the uncertainty is due to the variation of the renormalization (\u00b5 R ) and factorization (\u00b5 F ) scales (scale), the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ) uncertainties, and the uncertainty in parton distribution functions (PDF). The predicted cross section results in a low expected event rate, and the acceptance for HH events in the detector is small. This means that the SM HH production process cannot be observed with the data collected so far at the LHC: the expectation is that it will only be possible to set an upper limit on the HH production cross section, as discussed, e.g. in refs. [18,19]. However, the cross section can be enhanced by anomalous couplings in BSM models [20] and in some cases the enhancement is large enough that HH production could be observed with the current data.",

The data collected in 2015 and 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV were used for improved analyses in the decay channels: bbbb [19], bb \u03bd \u03bd [23], bb \u03bdqq [24], bb\u03c4 \u03c4 [18,25], bb\u03b3\u03b3 [26,27], \u03b3\u03b3WW * [28], and WW * WW * [29]. An additional search in the bbbb decay channel focused on the region of phase space where one bb pair is highly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet [30]. In the cases mentioned above, at least one of the two Higgs bosons is required to decay to bb to exploit the large branching fraction of this decay. Results were found to be compatible within uncertainties to the expected SM background contribution. The measurement of nonresonant HH production at the LHC with the tightest expected upper limit (15 times the SM rate) was made in the bb\u03c4 \u03c4 channel [25], yielding an observed upper limit equivalent to 13 times the SM rate.",

            "text": "This article reports the results of a search for HH production with both Higgs bosons decaying into bottom quark pairs, resulting in four resolved hadronic jets. The search is performed using 13 TeV pp collisions data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS detector in 2016. The final state containing four b quarks has the highest branching fraction of all possible HH final states, corresponding to \u22480.339 for an SM Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. It is one of the most sensitive signatures for the investigation of HH production, as confirmed by the results of a similar search recently performed by the ATLAS Collaboration [19]. The main challenge for this analysis is the large background from multijet final states produced by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes, which collectively yield rates exceeding that of the signal by several orders of magnitude. We address this by fully exploiting the distinctive features of the signal: the presence of four b quarks and the kinematical properties of the decay process. In a sample selected by requiring four b quark jets, a multivariate event classifier is trained to discriminate signal from background. This sample is studied by comparing it to a model of all contributing background processes, which is completely based on data. Because of the use of different data sets, triggers, and offline selection requirements, this analysis is fully independent from the CMS searches mentioned above [18,23,26,30].  Figure 1. Feynman diagrams that contribute to HH production via gluon-gluon fusion at LO. Diagrams (a) and (b) correspond to SM-like processes, while diagrams (c), (d), and (e) correspond to pure BSM effects: (c) and (d) describe contact interactions between the Higgs boson and gluons, and (e) describes the contact interaction of two Higgs bosons with top quarks.",

The five parameters of the Lagrangian, named \u03ba \u03bb , \u03ba t , c g , c 2g , and c 2 , are related to the Higgs boson couplings. In particular, the multiplicative factors \u03ba \u03bb = \u03bb HHH /\u03bb SM and \u03ba t = y t /y SM parametrize deviations from the SM values of, respectively, the Higgs boson trilinear coupling and the top quark Yukawa coupling. The former is given by \u03bb SM = m 2 H /2v 2 , with v being the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. The absolute couplings c g , c 2g , and c 2 parametrize contact interactions not predicted by the SM, i.e. the coupling of the Higgs boson to gluons and those of the two Higgs bosons to two gluons or to a top quark-antiquark pair, which could arise through the mediation of very heavy new states. In eq. (2.1), m t is the mass of the top quark, and G \u00b5\u03bd the gluon field. We neglect possible modifications of the bottom quark Yukawa coupling \u03ba b , which is already constrained by LHC data [32]. The Feynman diagrams contributing to HH production in pp collisions at leading order (LO) are shown in figure 1. The translation of the above parametrization to the flavour-diagonal Higgs basis (as discussed in ref. [31]) is trivial; we use the notation of eq. (2.1) for simplicity.",

However, the allowed phase space is still large and a precise scan is not feasible. The kinematical properties of the pair-produced Higgs bosons depend strongly on the values of those five couplings. A statistical approach has been developed in order to identify regions of the parameter space that have similar final state kinematical properties. The approach uses the generator-level distributions of the invariant mass of the HH system (m gen HH ) and the modulus of the cosine of the polar angle of one Higgs boson with respect to the beam axis (|cos \u03b8 * gen |) to cluster the points in the parameter space. In each region found, a representative benchmark model is selected as the point having most similar kinematical properties to the other points in the region. The procedure, described in ref. [33], leads to twelve benchmarks that taken together best represent, within a limited uncertainty, the phenomenology of the whole five-dimensional space. An additional benchmark (box), representative of the null Higgs boson self-coupling hypothesis, is also considered. The parameter values of the benchmarks are listed in table 1. The search for BSM signals presented here is focused on these benchmarks.",

Its central feature is a superconducting solenoid with an internal diameter of 6 m. The solenoid generates a magnetic field of 3.8 T inside a volume occupied by four main sub-detectors, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections: silicon pixel and strip tracker detectors, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). The pixel JHEP04 (2019)112tracker provides an impact parameter resolution for charged tracks of about 15 \u00b5m, which allows for a precise reconstruction of secondary vertices, crucially used to identify jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks (b jets). Muons are measured in gasionization detectors embedded in a steel flux return yoke outside the solenoid. Information from the calorimeters and muon detectors is used by the first level of the CMS trigger [34], a system based on custom hardware processors that provides the first online event selection. The second level of the CMS trigger, also called high-level trigger and consisting of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, further selects events using information from the whole detector before sending them downstream for detailed processing and storage. Particles produced in the pp collisions are detected in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 5. Pseudorapidity is defined as |\u03b7| = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2), where the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, which points along the beam direction toward the Jura mountains from LHC Point 5. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in [35].",

The combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) algorithm [36] is used to identify b jets. This algorithm exploits the relatively long lifetime of hadrons containing b quarks (c\u03c4 \u223c 450 \u00b5m), which results in a displaced decay point of the produced b hadrons. The reconstructed trajectories of charged decay products from b hadrons thus exhibit significant impact parameters with respect to the b quark production point. The CSVv2 algorithm uses the impact parameter information together with information on other characteristics of the jets to discriminate jets originating from b quarks from those produced by the hadronization of light quarks or gluons. Two trigger paths contribute to the online selection. In the first trigger path jets are considered if their momentum transverse to the beam direction, p T , is above 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.6. Selected events must contain at least four such jets of which at least three are tagged as b jets by the CSVv2 algorithm and at least two have p T > 90 GeV. The second trigger path requires at least four jets with p T > 45 GeV with at least three tagged as b jets by the CSVv2 algorithm.

The numbers of events used to determine the weights at generator level are 3 000 000 for the SM sample and 50 000 for each BSM benchmark. In the following, we always use the Pangea sample instead of the 14 original samples to study signal properties in each model considered. Although our search employs an approach fully based on data to model backgrounds, we make use of a simulation of QCD processes for several cross-checks. This simulation consists of a collection of seven simulated data sets of contiguous ranges in the H gen T variable, which is defined as the scalar sum of the p T of all partons that originate from the hard-scattering process in a simulated event. The samples are generated by Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 at LO, using the NNPDF30 lo as 0130 set, and are then interfaced with pythia 8.212 [41] for fragmentation and parton showering, using the MLM matching [42]; their equivalent integrated luminosity depends on the H gen T range considered and increases from 0.06 to 400 fb \u22121 as H gen T varies between 200 and 2000 GeV. For additional studies of the sub-dominant background from top quark pairs, a large nextto-leading order (NLO) powheg 2.0 [43][44][45] sample of inclusive tt [46] events is used. The behaviour of minor backgrounds is verified and a study of their contamination of our selected sample is carried out using powheg 2.0 NLO samples of single top quark t channel [47], ttH [48], single Higgs boson production [49], and associated ZH production [50]. In addition, we use single top quark s channel, tttt, ttbb, and bbH samples generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 at NLO. All of those samples are interfaced with pythia 8.212 for parton showering and fragmentation. The tt sample utilises the generator tune CUETP8M2T4 [51] for the underlying event activity, other samples interfaced with pythia use the tune CUETP8M1 [52]. The tt, ttH, single Higgs boson, and ZH samples are generated using the NNPDF30 nlo as 0118 PDF set. The single top quark, ttbb, and bbH samples are generated with the NNPDF30 nlo nf 4 pdfas set. The NNPDF30 nlo nf 5 pdfas set is used to generate the tttt sample. All of the PDF sets are taken from the LHAPDF6 set [53]. The response of the CMS detector is modelled using Geant4 [54].",

In this process, the identification of the particle type (photon, electron, muon, charged hadron, neutral -6 -JHEP04 (2019)112hadron) plays an important role in the determination of the particle direction and energy. Electrons (e.g. coming from photon conversions in the tracker material or from b hadron semileptonic decays) are identified as a primary charged particle track and one or more ECAL energy clusters corresponding to this track extrapolation to the ECAL and to possible bremsstrahlung photons emitted along the way through the tracker material. Muons (e.g. from b hadron semileptonic decays) are identified as a track in the central tracker consistent with either a track or several hits in the muon system, associated with an energy deficit in the calorimeters. The objects primarily considered in this analysis are hadronic jets, composed of particles produced by quark fragmentation and hadronization. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zerosuppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. Jets are reconstructed from PF candidates using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [56] with a distance parameter of 0.4, as implemented in the FastJet package [57]. Jet energy corrections are applied to both data and simulation to scale the energy and correct for differences in the detector response in real and simulated collisions [58]. Jet identification criteria are also applied in order to reject fake jets from detector noise and jets originating from primary vertices not associated with the hard interaction [59]. The combined multivariate algorithm (cMVAv2) [36] is used in the offline analysis to identify jets that originate from the hadronization of b quarks. The cMVAv2 builds on the CSV algorithm by adding soft-lepton information to the combined discriminant. The value of the multivariate discriminant used depends on the required suppression of jets from light quarks and gluons. The medium working point of the cMVAv2, defined such that the misidentification rate of light quarks and gluons as b jets is 1%, is used in this analysis. For jets produced by the hadronization of b quarks emitted in HH production events, the medium working point corresponds to a b-tagging efficiency of about 65% for the jets of interest of this analysis.",

This procedure, which does not explicitly use the known mass of the Higgs boson, allows the dijet masses for the selected combinations to retain the power to discriminate the HH production signal from the background. A multivariate technique is used in order to improve the sensitivity of the analysis. A BDT discriminator is trained to distinguish the SM signal from backgrounds (as described in section 8), using the XGBoost library [60].

By applying this procedure to the whole set of events of the data to be modelled, and by choosing a limiting value K for k, we obtain a total of K 2 data sets, each equal in size to the original one, and each featuring very similar characteristics to the original one, despite being made up entirely of artificial events.",

The reconstruction of the transverse thrust axis, and the decomposition of events into hemispheres using that axis as a seed, uses the independent fragmentation of the two final state partons as a working hypothesis to create artificial replicas of the original events. The method destroys any correlation in the jet distribution between the two hemispheres, so that any physical effect, such as the decay of a heavy object into jet pairs, is washed out in the artificial samples. Because of this, the resulting artificial data sets are unaffected by the presence of a small signal contamination in the original data. This has been verified by signal injection tests. We started with an original data set composed of simulated QCD multijet events to which is added an additional component of signal corresponding to a cross section 100 times larger than the one expected by the SM. After hemisphere mixing, the kinematical properties of the resulting artificial samples are found to resemble closely those from the QCD multijet part of the original data set, which is its dominant component, and unaffected by the minority component (the signal contamination). Naively this can be understood if we note that, if the signal fraction in the original sample amounts to e.g. 0.1%, the probability that a signal event is modelled using two different hemispheres both originally belonging to signal events is of the order of 0.0001%. Event-based variables such as the two Higgs boson candidate masses, which are obtained by the minimum \u2206M criterion described in section 7 and are thus sensitive to the characteristics of both hemispheres together, do not retain their distribution in events where only one hemisphere is taken from an HH decay event.",

Not all of the data sets are fully independent so only a subset can be safely employed for further studies. We use the following collections of artificial events in the measurement: for the training sample, we use all artificial events of types (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2); for the validation sample, all artificial events of types (3,4), (5,6), (7,8), and (9,10); and for the application sample, all artificial events of types (4,3), (6,5), (8,7), and (10,9). This split guarantees that the three samples have equal number of events, and that the validation and application samples are independent of each other, being constituted of artificial events made up of different hemispheres. For the training sample the partial use of the same hemispheres in modelling different artificial events might at most slightly degrade the discrimination power but does not have a detrimental effect on the subsequent steps of the analysis. A study is performed by switching the validation and application samples and we find that this does not change the results. The fraction of data events that are totally replicated in the background template is completely negligible. A comparison between the distributions obtained through the procedure described above and by using MC simulation for QCD multijet processes can be seen in figure 3 for a number of variables.

For this purpose, we define two control regions (CRs): the first one, called the m H CR, is obtained by removing from the data events where the leading and trailing dijet masses are in the region 90 < M H 1 < 150 GeV, 80 < M H 2 < 140 GeV. This avoids using events belonging to the signal-enriched region. In the second region, the b tag CR, fully orthogonal to the default selection, we select events with at least four b-tagged jets as defined by the loose working point of the cMVAv2, while vetoing events with any jets that are defined as b-tagged jets according to the medium working point of the cMVAv2. The loose working point of the cMVAv2 has a misidentification rate of \u224810% and a b-tagging efficiency of \u224885% for jets produced by the hadronization of b quarks emitted in HH production events. The distributions of all individual event variables for the artificial data sets are compared to those from the original data set in these two CRs and are found to be in agreement. This is illustrated for a number of variables in figures 4 and 5. However, the power of the technique rests in its ability to provide fully multidimensional modelling. To verify this, a first cross-check consists of comparing the full BDT shape for data and the artificial model in the m H CR. We observe an agreement in the shape of the BDT discriminator with a slight excess of background events in the lower range of the BDT output (as can be seen in figure 6, left). A similar trend is seen in the b tag CR.",

Left: comparison of the distribution of BDT output for data (left) selected in a region of the leading versus trailing Higgs boson candidate mass plane that excludes a 60-GeV-wide box around the most probable values of the dijet masses of signal events, with the corresponding output on an artificial sample obtained from the same data set by hemisphere mixing. Right: bin-by-bin differences between data and model, in s.d. units before (upper right) and after (lower right) bias correction; pull distribution for the differences, fit to a Gaussian distribution. The bias correction uncertainty is increased to take the s.d. of the residuals to 1.0. this comparison. The variance related to the background bias extraction, together with expected statistical uncertainty, are estimated and accounted for as a systematic uncertainty in the final fit described in section 10. The validity of this background bias extraction procedure has been checked by applying it to the data in the two CRs previously mentioned. The means of the per bin expectation values minus the observed values are compatible with zero after the bias correction in both control regions, the root-mean-square of the pulls is compatible with one after the bias correction in the b tag CR, but not in the m H CR, as shown on figure 6 (upper right). To account for this, we increase the uncertainty in the background such that the value of standard deviation (s.d.) becomes 1.0 in the m H CR after the bias correction is applied (figure 6, lower right).",

The signal yield for a given production cross section is affected by a systematic uncertainty in the measured integrated luminosity of 2.5% [63]. The effect of variation of the \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F scales on the signal acceptance is estimated by taking the maximum and the minimum difference with respect to the nominal acceptance when varying \u00b5 F and \u00b5 R each individually as well as both together up and down by a factor of two.

The difference between observed and expected limits is similar for SM and all the benchmark models. This is explained by the fact that the benchmark points use the same BDT as SM, resulting in the same background shape as an input to the fit. The background shape has a deficit of events compared to data in the last bins of the BDT distribution, as seen in figure 7. We also search for HH production with values of \u03ba \u03bb in the range [-20, 20], assuming \u03ba t = 1, and the results are shown in figure 10.
