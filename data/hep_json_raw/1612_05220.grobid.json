Differential crosssections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and absolute rapidity of the top quark, and of the transverse momentum, absolute rapidity and invariant mass of the tt system. The tt events are selected by requiring one electron and one muon of opposite electric charge, and at least two jets, one of which must be tagged as containing a b-hadron. The measured differential cross-sections are compared to predictions of next-to-leading order generators matched to parton showers and the measurements are found to be consistent with all models within the experimental uncertainties with the exception of the Powheg-Box + Herwig++ predictions, which differ significantly from the data in both the transverse momentum of the top quark and the mass of the tt system. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

Significant progress has been made in the precision of the calculations of the cross-section of this process, both inclusive and differential. Currently, calculations are available at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].",

            "text": "Differential cross-sections for tt production have been measured by the ATLAS [12][13][14] and CMS [15,16] experiments, in events containing either one or two charged leptons, at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV. Measurements of tt differential cross-sections at \u221a s = 13 TeV have also been made at the CMS experiment [17] in events containing one charged lepton. The integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV allows the measurement of the differential cross-section as a function of the kinematic variables of the tt system in a different kinematic regime compared to the previous LHC measurements. The inclusive cross-section has been measured at \u221a s = 13 TeV by both the ATLAS [18] and CMS [19,20] experiments and was found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions. This article presents measurements of tt differential cross-sections in terms of five different kinematic observables, both absolute and normalised to the fiducial cross-section. These observables are the transverse momen-tum of the top quark ( p T (t)), the absolute rapidity of the top quark (|y(t)|), the transverse momentum of the tt system ( p T (tt)), the absolute rapidity of the tt system (|y(tt)|), and the invariant mass of the tt system (m(tt)). The distributions of these variables are unfolded to the particle level in a fiducial volume. The p T (t) and m(tt) observables are expected to be sensitive to the modelling of higher-order corrections in QCD, whereas the rapidity of the top quark and tt system are expected to have sensitivity to the parton distribution functions (PDF) used in the simulations. The p T (tt) observable is sensitive to the amount of gluon radiation in the event and can be useful for the tuning of Monte Carlo (MC) generators. Top quarks and anti-top quarks are measured in one combined distribution for the p T (t) and |y(t)| observables, rather than studying them separately. The tt system is reconstructed in events containing exactly one electron and one muon. Events in which a \u03c4 lepton decays to an electron or muon are also included.",

Powheg-Box is interfaced to the CT10 [34] NLO PDF set while Pythia6 uses the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [35]. A set of tuned parameters called the Perugia 2012 tune [36] is used in the simulation of the underlying event. The \"h damp \" parameter, which controls the p T of the first additional gluon emission beyond the Born configuration, is set to the mass of the top quark (m t ). The main effect of this is to regulate the highp T emission against which the tt system recoils. The choice of this h damp value was found to improve the modelling of the tt system kinematics with respect to data in previous analyses [37]. In order to investigate the effects of initial-and final-state radiation, alternative Powheg-Box + Pythia 6 samples are generated with the renormalisation and factorisation scales varied by a factor of 2 (0.5) and using low (high) radiation variations of the Perugia 2012 tune and an h damp value of m t (2m t ), corresponding to less (more) parton-shower radiation [37], referred to as \"radHi\" and \"radLo\". These variations were selected to cover the uncertainties in the measurements of differential distributions in \u221a s = 7 TeV data [12]. The h damp value for the low radiation sample is not decreased as it was found to disagree with previously published data. Alternative samples are generated using Powheg-Box (v2) and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (v2.2.1) [38], referred to as MG5_aMC@NLO hereafter, both interfaced to Her-wig++ (v2.7.1) [39], in order to estimate the effects of the choice of matrix-element event generator and parton-shower algorithm. Additional tt samples are generated for comparisons with unfolded data using Sherpa (v2.2.0) [40], Powheg-Box (v2) + Pythia8 as well as Powheg-Box (v2) and MG5_aMC@NLO interfaced to Herwig 7 [39,41]. In all tt samples, the mass of the top quark is set to 172.5 GeV. These tt samples are described in further detail in Ref. [37].",

Electron candidates are identified by matching an inner-detector track to an isolated energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter, within the fiducial region of transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.47. Electron candidates are excluded if the calorimeter cluster is within the transition region between the barrel and the endcap of the electromagnetic calorimeter, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52. Electrons are selected using a multivariate algorithm and are required to satisfy a likelihood-based quality criterion, in order to provide high efficiency and good rejection of fake electrons [54,55]. Electron candidates must have tracks that pass the requirements of transverse impact parameter significance 2 |d sig 0 | < 5 and longitudinal impact parameter |z 0 sin \u03b8 | < 0.5 mm. Electrons must pass isolation requirements based on inner-detector tracks and topological clusters in the calorimeter which depend on \u03b7 and p T . These requirements result in an isolation efficiency of 95% for an electron p T of 25 GeV and 99% for an electron p T above 60 GeV when determined in simulated Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events. The fakeelectron rate determined in simulated tt events is 2%. Electrons that share a track with a muon are discarded. Double counting of electron energy deposits as jets is prevented by removing the closest jet within R = 0.2 of a reconstructed electron. Following this, the electron is discarded if a jet exists within R = 0.4 of the electron to ensure sufficient separation from nearby jet activity.",

Jets are accepted within the range p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and are calibrated using simulation with corrections derived from data [59]. Jets likely to originate from pile-up are suppressed using a multivariate jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) [60,61] for candidates with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets are identified as candidates for containing b-hadrons using a multivariate discriminant [62], which uses track impact parameters, track invariant mass, track multiplicity and secondary vertex information to discriminate b-jets from light-quark or gluon jets (light jets). The average b-tagging efficiency is 76%, with a purity of 90%, for b-jets in simulated dileptonic tt events. E miss T is reconstructed using calibrated electrons, muons and jets [63], where the electrons and muons are required to satisfy the selection criteria above. Tracks associated with the primary vertex are used for the computation of E miss T from energy not associated with electrons, muons or jets. The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest sum of p 2 T of tracks associated with it. Signal events are selected by requiring exactly one electron and one muon of opposite electric charge, and at least two jets, at least one of which must be b-tagged. No requirements are made on the E miss T in the event. Using this selection, 85% of events are expected to be tt events. The other processes that pass the signal selection are Drell-Yan (Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ), diboson and single-top quark (W t) production and fakelepton events.",

The data and prediction agree within the total uncertainty for all distributions. The p T observables show a small deficit in the simulation prediction at low p T which was found to be correlated with the modelling of the top-quark p T .   The four-momenta of each electron or muon is summed with the four-momenta of all radiated photons, excluding those from hadron decays, within a cone of size R = 0.1, and the resulting objects are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Particle-level jets are constructed using stable particles, with the exception of selected particle-level electrons and muons and particle-level neutrinos originating from W -boson decays, using the anti-k t algorithm with a radius parameter of R = 0.4, in the region p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Intermediate b-hadrons in the MC decay chain history are clustered in the stable-particle jets with their energies set to zero. If, after clustering, a particle-level jet contains one or more of these \"ghost\" b-hadrons, the jet is said to have originated from a b-quark. This technique is referred to as \"ghost matching\" [64].

In Cov and S, a single bin is removed from the calculation to account for the normalisation of the observable, signified by the (N \u22121) subscript. The \u03c7 2 , NDF, and associated p-values are presented in Table 5 for the normalised cross-sections.

For the p T (tt) spectrum, again little difference is observed between Powheg-Box + Pythia6 and Pythia8, and both generally predict a softer spectrum than the data but are also consistent within the experimental uncertainties. The MG5_aMC@NLO generator, interfaced to Pythia8 or Her-wig++ seems to agree with the data at low to medium values of p T but MG5_aMC@NLO + Herwig++ disagrees at higher values. For the m(tt) observable, although the uncertainties are quite large, predictions from Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia 6 or Pythia 8 and the MG5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8 prediction seem higher than the observed data around 600 GeV.

The differential cross-sections are determined in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 channel, for the transverse momentum and the absolute rapidity of the top quark, as well as the transverse momentum, the absolute rapidity, and the invariant mass of the top-quark pair. The measured differential cross-sections are compared to predictions of NLO generators matched to parton showers and the results are found to be consistent with all models within the experimental uncertainties, with the exception of Powheg -Box + Herwig ++, which deviates from the data in the p T (t) and m(tt) observables.
