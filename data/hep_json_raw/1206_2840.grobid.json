This proof is particularly interesting since does not need the knowledge of the distance between the place where the neutrinos are produced (CERN) and the place where they are detected (LNGS). Since the Superluminal neutrinos generated in the physics community a vivid interest in good and bad behaviour in physics research, the author thought it was appropriate to recall the origin of the Gran Sasso Lab, of the 3 rd neutrino, of the horizontal muons due to the \"Teramo Anomaly\" and of the oscillation between leptonic flavours, when the CERN-Gran Sasso neutrino beam was included in the project for the most powerful underground Laboratory in the world.",

Dick Dalitz, the author of the (\u03c4\u03b8) puzzle, regretted very much that the existence of the large time-like (EMFF) of the nucleon did not allow the discovery of the 3 rd lepton at CERN in the early sixties. For the very simple reason that, in this case as often pointed out by Dalitz, the notation would not be \u03c4 and \u03bd \u03c4 but HL and ! !\" . This is why the 44 th course of the Subnuclear Physics School in Erice was dedicated to Richard Dalitz, as shown in Figure 7.   (Figure 8). The Ceremony was chaired by Tsung Dao Lee (Figure 9).  As you all know the physics of OPERA is focused to the study of neutrino oscillations which -as mentioned before -was indeed in the scientific aims of the Gran Sasso Project (Figure 10) presented by me at the Commission on Public Works of the Italian Senate. There are two Figures (11 and 12) which I presented at the Commission in 1979, after having discussed with the President of the Italian Republic, Sandro Pertini, the new projects for the future activities of the INFN.  were continuing their campaign against the Gran Sasso Project.",

Bruno Pontecorvo never lost any occasion to emphasize the value of studying the oscillations between neutrino flavours. In fact in his original paper he was suggesting the study of (!!) oscillations. The flavours oscillations came later, as reported in a note by Gillo Pontecorvo (Figure 14). Let me close this brief recollection of the origin of the LNGS showing the basic characteristics of the Lab (Figure 15), the cover page ( Figure 16) of a volume edited by Sandro Bettini, on the occasion of the XX Anniversary of the Gran Sasso Lab and a synthesis of the evolution of the three gauge couplings (Figure 17). This evolution was studied in order to illustrate the complementarity of the Gran Sasso Project and the other projects (LEP, LHC and ELN) where high energy colliders were involved. The complementarity of all projects proposed in the five-years INFN plan (where the increase by an order of magnitude for the financial support was requested) had to be proved with strong physics arguments in order to convince 1 st rank fellows.   This is because, during the difficult times of the Gran Sasso Projects there were 2 nd and 3 rd rank people called physicist doing underground lobbying and stating that this project was against the other Italian engagements in Europe which I had included in the five-years INFN plan.",

Zichichi in which the renormalization group running of the couplings using supersymmetry was studied with the result that the convergence of the three couplings improved. This work was not published, but perhaps known to a few. The statement quoted is the first instance in which it was pointed out that supersymmetry might play an important role in the convergence of the gauge couplings. In fact, the convergence of three straight lines (! ! !! ! ! !! ! ! !! ) with a change in slope is guaranteed by the Euclidean geometry, as long as the point where the slope changes is tuned appropriately. What is non trivial about the convergence of the couplings is that, with the initial conditions given by the LEP results, the change in the slope at M SUSY ~ 1 TeV is not correct, as claimed by some authors not aware in 1991 of what was known in 1979 to A. Petermann and A. Zichichi.",

If you want to be the father of a new idea, you should fully devote your intellectual energy to understand all details and to work out the best way in order to put the new idea under experimental test. This can take years of work. You should not give up. If you believe that your new idea is a good one, you should work hard and never be afraid to reach the point where a new-comer can, with little effort, find the result you have been working, for so many years, to get. The new-comer can never take away from you the privilege of having been the first to open a new field with your intelligence, imagination and hard work. Do not be afraid to encourage others to pursue your dream. If it becomes real, the community will never forget that you have been the first to open the field.\u00bb (1972).
