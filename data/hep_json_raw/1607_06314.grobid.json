Extensions to the SM may introduce additional CP-violating phases that alter the value of the B 0 s -B 0 s mixing weak phase, \u03c6 s , from that of the SM [1]. The B 0 s system exhibits a sizeable difference in the decay widths L and H , where L and H refer to the light and heavy B 0 s mass eigenstates, respectively. The effective lifetime, \u03c4 eff , of a B 0 s meson decay mode is measured by approximating the decay time distribution, determined in the B 0 s rest system, by a single exponential function. For final states that can be accessed by both B 0 s and B 0 s mesons the effective lifetime depends on their CP components and is also sensitive to \u03c6 s [2,3].",

The subsequent software trigger is composed of two stages. The first performs a partial event reconstruction and requires events to have two well-identified oppositely charged muons with an invariant mass larger than 2.7 GeV/c 2 . The second stage performs a full event reconstruction. Events are retained for further processing if they contain a displaced J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidate.

In a first step, loose selection criteria are applied that reduce background significantly whilst retaining high signal efficiency. Subsequently, a multivariate selection (MVA) is used to reduce further the combinatorial background. This is optimized using pseudoexperiments to obtain the best precision on the measured B 0 s lifetime. The selection starts from a pair of oppositely charged particles, identified as muons, that form a common decay vertex. Combinatorial background is suppressed by requiring that \u03c7 2 IP of the muon candidates 1 to all reconstructed PVs to be larger than four. To ensure a high reconstruction efficiency the muon candidates are required to have a pseudorapidity between 2.0 and 4.5.

The decay angle between the photon momentum in the \u03b7 rest frame and the direction of Lorentz boost from the laboratory frame to the \u03b7 rest frame, \u03b8 * \u03b7 , is required to satisfy cos \u03b8 * \u03b7 < 0.8. decay time must be larger than 0.3 ps and less than 10 ps. If more than one PV is reconstructed in an event the properties of the unassociated vertices are studied. Any candidate for which there is a second PV with \u03c7 2 IP < 50 is rejected. This requirement has an efficiency of 98% that is almost flat as a function of the decay time and reduces background due to incorrect association of the B 0 (s) candidate to a PV. Finally, as in Ref. [21], the position of the PV along the beam-line is required to be within 10 cm of the nominal interaction point, where the standard deviation of this variable is approximately 5 cm. This criterion leads to a 10% reduction in signal yield but defines a fiducial region where the reconstruction efficiency is uniform.",

Im-proved precision on the effective lifetimes \u03c4 L and \u03c4 H will enable more stringent tests of the consistency between direct measurements of the decay width difference s = L \u2212 H measured in B \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 decays and those inferred using effective lifetimes. The measurement of the effective B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03b7 lifetime presented in this Letter uses 3 fb \u22121 of data collected in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV during 2011 and 2012 using the LHCb detector.
