The observation of pentaquark states by LHCb, and the Z-charged states observed at Belle and BES III have raised even more the attention to the field. Presently several states are observed that do not fit potential models, and looking for them in different production mechanisms and search for their decay modes it is important, as well as to do precise measurement of their mass, width, lineshape. We shortly report in this note about the plan in searching for exotics at Belle II at KEK (Tsukuba, Japan), that just ended the Phase-II running period, and show the first re-discovery results using 5 pb \u22121 integrated luminosity.",

            "text": "The Gell-Mann Zweig idea, known as the Costituent Quark Model [1,2] (CQM), classifies all known hadrons, and is still valid after more than half century, although in the meantime the quark top and bottom have been added to the pattern rising the number of quark families to 3. QCD-(Quantum Chromodynamics) motivated models based on this idea predict the existence of more complex structures than simple mesons (2 quark-bound states) or baryons (3 quark-bound states). Since the observation of the X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [3], and subsequent confirmations [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] it became evident that the Charmonium-like states with more than 3 quarks exist, and a flood of new theories and possible interpretations have been brought up.",

After the observation of the X(3872) in 2003, from experimental point of view, lots of effort was put in searching for new forms of bound states. Some of them well fits the theory, while others are found at unexpected mass values, and still several possible interpretations are opened, mostly due to the poor available statistics in the past experiments to investigate them, i.e. performing a full amplitude analysis, or detector limitations did not allow to measure the very narrow width, crucial to discriminate among different theoretical interpretations [11]. Undoubtedly, the Belle experiment [12] gave an important and substantial contribution to the field.",

Several other states were then observed by analyzing the invariant mass distribution of J\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c8(2S )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in processes like e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 IS R J/\u03c8(\u03c8(2S ))\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The quantum numbers of these states are obviously known, J PC =1 \u2212\u2212 , but still not clear their interpretation. The Y(4260) was then confirmed by Belle [15] in the invariant mass system of J\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , where the Belle collaboration claims also the evidence of a new state, the Y(4008); then the Belle collaboartion announced also the Y(4360) and Y(4660) in the invariant mass system of \u03c8(2S )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 via ISR processes [16]. This search is peculiar in e + e \u2212 detectors. In particular, Belle II will be in a unique position to perform such analyses with 50 ab \u22121 , which was suffering for statistics limitation at the previous BaBar and Belle. It is interesting to notice that all the observed Y-vector states range in roughly 1 GeV/c 2 mass window, but they do not mix, which is surprising. Further investigation is then needed with the huge Belle II data set. The new nomenclature in the PDG [17] indicates these Y-vector states as \u03c8-states.",

Z states are clearly exotics, as they are charged, while Charmonium states are supposed to be neutral. In the past years several Z states were observed at the BES III experiment, in \u03c0 + J/\u03c8 (e.g. the Z(3900) [21]), or \u03c0 + \u03c8' (e.g. the Z(4050) [22]). It is interesting to notice that all these exotic observations have come over almost the full available Belle statistics, \u2248 1 ab \u22121 , and in some case Belle obtained only the evidence of such states. This implies that further search is needed, with improved statistics. For most of these states quantum numbers are still not properly defined, due to the lack of statistics that made not possible an angular analysis. Our understanding is that the Z-charged states can be classified in 2 main categories: those quite large, apparently not connected to threshold (e.g. the Z(4430) and the Z(4200), seen in B meson decays); and those pretty narrow, directly seen in e + e \u2212 collisions and/or ISR processes, such as the Z(3900) and the Z(4020). The Belle II experiment with the planned huge statistics can continue the search in this field, and it is in a unique position, as it can search for both types of Z-charged states, and eventually find the connection and understand the pattern. Definitively more investigation with higher statistics is needed in this field.",

This field represents a challenge that Belle II can take, exploring the search of Z b states, which up to now were observed only in \u03a5(5S ) decays. SuperKEKB can reach the energy in the center of mass of \u224811 GeV, meaning that the \u03a5(6S ) decays will be accessible. It represents a unique possibility for the Belle II experiment. The plan is to look then for radiative transitions between bottomonium states, not possible at the previous Belle experiment due to the lack of statistics. The current results on Z b search are well summarized in Refs. [23,24], where the branching fractions of Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) are reported. Belle II can take a big advantage in this search for the future: if Z b are loosely bound states, several new molecular states should show up in the spectrum. We plan to:",

Later on, on 26 th of April, 2018 the first luminosity run started, and first collisions happened, showing that the experiment is in good shape. In Figs. 1-2 first results on data are shown: the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass and the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distributions are shown over 5 pb \u22121 integrated luminosity. Even with so low luminosity run, hints of charm-physics can be seen, in the reconstruction of the D * \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 channel. We are looking forward to see the results of analyses at the end of Phase-II, which just happened on 17 th of July, 2018. Phase III will start from next year 2019, when the Pixel Detector will be finally included in the full detector set up. Great achievements are expected when Belle II will collect the first 10 ab \u22121 , planned by the end of 2020. ",
