Tracking a charged particle in LHCb usually requires to have hits in all the tracking stations (long track ) or in all but the VELO (See Fig. 1) tracking stations (downstream track ). The former limits the decay length to 1 metre while the second allows up to 2 metres. Decays further downstream, albeit reconstructible, would not allow a momentum measurement of the tracks. In addition to this, the trigger imposes constraints to the transverse momenta of the particles in an event. In particular during Run 1 and Run 2, typical thresholds at the level of p T > 1 \u2212 5 GeV/c were required for at least a muon or a hadron in the event in the first hardware level of the LHCb trigger (L0). Strange-hadrons are often too soft for these L0 thresholds, nevertheless given the high production rates it is sufficient that a small fraction of the events are triggered by the signal in question (Triggered On Signal, TOS), and in addition one can exploit event triggered by other particles in the same event (Triggered Independently of Signal, TIS).

This will allow unprecedented statistics to be collected for heavy-flavours; while it will be represent a challenge to keep triggering also strange physics, the highly customisable software trigger from the Upgrade phase on will allow to target with exclusive lines all the interesting decays, reaching efficiencies which could be up to 100% evaluated on top of offline selected signals.

The latter is currently known with about 50% uncertainty from a measurement by the NA48 Collaboration, B(K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = (2.9 +1.5 \u22121.2 \u00b10.2)\u00d710 \u22129 [11].

The sensitivity to K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays at LHCb has been studied in Ref. [12], with two different reconstruction methods: one with a full reconstruction and one without reconstructing the soft \u03c0 0 , which poses difficulties in the LHCb detector. This partial reconstruction still allows a good invariant mass reconstruction assuming a dummy \u03c0 0 , given the very low q value of the decay.

Dozens of decays have been studied between K 0 S , and hyperons showing that LHCb will be in the position to give many different contributions to strange-hadron physics in the near future. Interestingly, one can also use charged kaons at LHCb. While their decay length is very long compared to LHCb acceptance, it has already been shown [16] that high yield decays such as K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays, can be reconstructed and used for physics calibration. This same decay mode has been proposed for the measurement of the K + mass, that suffers a long-standing discrepancy among the most precise measurements [17]. In addition, with the full software trigger of the Upgrade it will be possible to study K + rare decays, such as K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + , albeit not being competitive with the NA62 experiment. Finally, a field in which LHCb will also be able to contribute, are the lepton-flavour-violating decays. Clearly these are extremely interesting being a null test of the SM and not suffering of its uncertainties. As such, they have been studied by several experiments and the current upper limits read: B(K L \u2192 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) < 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u221212 [18], B(K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) < 7.6\u00d710 \u221211 [19], B(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + e \u2212 \u00b5 + ) < 1.3\u00d710 \u221211 [20], B(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + e + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u221210 [21].

On \u039b hyperons, the branching fraction of the radiative \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0\u03b3 could also be improved and possibly access the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0e + e \u2212 decay. A large number of baryon number or lepton flavour violating decays have been recently constrained by the CLAS collaboration [23]: these could also be tested at LHCb. Higher strange-number baryons could also be probed at LHCb in order to test \u2206S = 2 processes, such as \u039e 0 \u2192 p\u03c0 and \u2126 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0, possibly improving limits by orders of magnitude.",
