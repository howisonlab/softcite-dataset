A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The Higgs bosons are highly Lorentzboosted and are each reconstructed as a single large-area jet. The signal is characterized by a peak in the dijet invariant mass distribution, above a background from the standard model multijet production. The observations are consistent with the background expectations, and are interpreted as upper limits on the products of the s-channel production cross sections and branching fractions of narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extra-dimensional models. The limits range from 126 to 1.4 fb at 95% confidence level for resonances with masses between 750 and 3000 GeV, and are the most stringent to date, over the explored mass range.",

However, the existence of massive resonances decaying to Higgs boson pairs (HH) in many new physics models may enhance this rate to a level observable at the CERN LHC using the current data. For instance, models with warped extra dimensions (WED) [5] contain new particles such as the spin-0 radion [6][7][8] and the spin-2 first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the graviton [9][10][11], which have sizeable branching fractions to HH. The WED models have an extra spatial dimension compactified between two branes, with the region between (called the bulk) warped via an exponential metric \u03bal, \u03ba being the warp factor and l the coordinate of the extra spatial dimension [12]. The reduced Planck scale (M Pl \u2261 M Pl /8\u03c0 , M Pl being the Planck scale) is considered a fundamental scale. The free parameters of the model are \u03ba/M Pl and the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory R \u2261 \u221a 6e \u2212\u03bal M Pl [6]. In pp collisions at the LHC, the graviton and the radion are produced primarily through gluon-gluon fusion and are predicted to decay to HH [13].",

The herwig++ 2.7.1 [52] generator is used for an alternative model to evaluate the systematic uncertainty associated with the parton shower and hadronization.

The double-b tagger exploits the presence of two hadronized b quarks inside the H jet, and uses variables related to b hadron lifetime and mass to distinguish between H jets and the background from multijet production; it also exploits the fact that the b hadron flight directions are strongly correlated with the axes used to calculate the N-subjettiness observables. The double-b tagger is a multivariate discriminator with output between \u22121 and 1, with a higher value indicating a greater probability for the jet to contain a bb pair. The double-b tagger discriminator thresholds of 0.3 and 0.8 correspond to H jet tagging efficiencies of 80 and 30% and are referred to as \"loose\" (L) and \"tight\" (T) requirements, respectively. Events must have the two leading p T AK8 jets satisfying the loose double-b tagger requirement.

Likewise, the R p/f for the TT signal region uses the ratio of the number of events in the \"TT, passing\" to the \"TT, failing\" sideband regions. The variation of R p/f as a function of m j 1 in each m j 1 sideband is fitted with a quadratic function. The fit to the pass-fail ratio is interpolated to the region where m j 1 lies within the H jet mass window of 105-135 GeV. An alternative fit using a third order polynomial was found to give the same interpolated value of R p/f in the Higgs jet mass window. Every event in the antitag region is scaled by the pass-fail ratio evaluated for the m j 1 of that event, to obtain the background prediction in the signal region. Fig. 5 shows the quadratic fit in the m j 1 sidebands of the passfail ratio R p/f as a function of m j 1 , as obtained in the data. The background prediction using this method, along with the number of observed events in the signal region is shown in Fig. 6. For resonance masses of 1200 GeV and above, the background estimation is improved by simultaneously fitting a parametric model for the background and signal to the data in the signal and the antitag regions for m jj,red \u2265 1100 GeV. In the fit, the ratio R p/f obtained from the sidebands is used to constrain the relative number of background events in the two regions. To account for possible R p/f dependence on m jj,red at high m jj,red values, the R p/f obtained from the fits shown in Fig. 5 is also parametrized as a linear function of m jj,red . The signal normalization is unconstrained in the fit, while the uncertainties in the parameters of the functions used to model the background and R p/f are treated as nuisance parameters. For the background modelling, a choice among an exponential function Ne \u2212a m jj,red , a \"levelled exponential\" function Ne \u2212a m jj,red /(1+a b m jj,red ) , and a \"quadratic levelled exponential function\" Ne was made, using a Fisher F-test [77]. At a confidence level of 95%, the levelled exponential function was found to be optimal. Since the background shapes in the signal regions, as predicted using the antitag re-gions, were found to be similar (Fig. 6), the parametric background modelling was tested using the antitag region in the data before applying it to the signal region.",

The control trigger used to measure this scale factor requires a single AK4 jet with p T > 260 GeV, and it too is subject to some inefficiency when m jj,red is close to 750 GeV, because of a difference between the jet energy scale used in the trigger and that used in the offline reconstruction. This inefficiency is measured using simulations, and has an associated total uncertainty of between 1% and 15%. The jet energy scale and resolution uncertainty is about 1% [63,64]. The jet mass scale and resolution, and \u03c4 21 selection efficiency data-to-simulation scale factor are measured using a sample of merged W jets in semileptonic tt events. The corresponding uncertainties are extrapolated to a higher p T range than that associated with tt events, using simulations. A correction factor is applied to account for the difference in the jet shower profile of W \u2192 qq and H \u2192 bb decays, by comparing the ratio of the efficiency of H and W jets using the pythia 8 and herwig++ shower generators. The jet mass scale and resolution has a 2% effect on the signal yields because of a change in the mean of the H jet mass distribution. The \u03c4 21 selection efficiency uncertainty amounts to a +30/\u221226% change in the signal yields. The uncertainty in the H tagging correction factor is in the range 7-20% depending on the resonance mass m X .

The final state consists of events with both Higgs bosons decaying to b quark-antiquark pairs, which were identified using jet substructure and b-tagging techniques applied to large-area jets. The data are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations, dominated by multijet events. Upper limits are set on the products of the resonant production cross sections of a Kaluza-Klein bulk graviton and a Randall-Sundrum radion, and their branching fraction to HH \u2192 bbbb.

Since some of the triggers impose a trimmed jet mass requirement, this affects the shape of the offline soft-drop jet mass, resulting in a steep rise above \u223c20 GeV. The distributions of the | \u03b7(j 1 , j 2 )| and the m jj,red variables are shown inFig. 2. In these figures, the multijet background is shown for different jet flavour categories: jets having two B hadrons (bb) or a single one (b), jets having a charm hadron (c), and all other jets (light).The double-b tagger discriminator of the two leading AK8 jets must exceed the loose threshold. In addition, if both discriminator values also exceed the tight threshold, events are classified in the \"TT\" category. Otherwise, they are classified in the \"LL\" category, which contains events with both j 1 and j 2 failing the tight threshold as well as events with either j 1 or j 2 passing the tight threshold while the other passes the loose threshold only.The backgrounds are estimated separately for each category, and the combination of the likelihoods for the TT and LL categories gives the optimal signal sensitivity over a wide range of resonance masses, according to studies performed using simulated signal and multijet samples. The TT category has a good background rejection for m X up to 2000 GeV. At higher resonance masses, where the background is small, the LL category provides better signal sensitivity.
