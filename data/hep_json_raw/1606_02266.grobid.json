            "text": "Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or a Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes H \u2192 ZZ, W W , \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c4 \u03c4, bb, and \u00b5\u00b5. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 \u00b1 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay of 5.4 and 5.5 standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.",

In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [3][4][5][6], the breaking of the symmetry is achieved through the introduction of a complex doublet scalar field, leading to the prediction of the existence of one physical neutral scalar particle, commonly known as the Higgs boson [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Through Yukawa interactions, the Higgs scalar field can also account for fermion masses [4,13]. While the SM does not predict the value of the Higgs boson mass, m H , the production cross sections and decay branching fractions (B) of the Higgs boson can be precisely calculated once its mass is known.",

Unless otherwise stated, in this paper it is assumed, as in refs. [17,18], that the particle under study is a single SM-like Higgs boson state, i.e. a CP-even scalar particle with the tensor coupling structure of the SM for its interactions. The Higgs boson width, predicted to be approximately 4 MeV in the SM, is assumed to be small enough that the narrow-width approximation is valid and that the Higgs boson production and decay mechanisms can be factorised. These assumptions are corroborated by tests of the spin and CP properties of the Higgs boson [20,21] and by studies of its width [18,[23][24][25]. The Higgs boson signal modelling is based on the hypothesis of a SM Higgs boson in terms of its production and decay kinematics. Measurements of differential production cross sections [26][27][28][29] support these assumptions within the current statistical uncertainties. The inherent model dependence related to these hypotheses applies to all results presented here; the reliance on this model has a negligible impact for small deviations from the SM, but could be important for significant deviations from the SM predictions.",

Section 3 gives an overview of the analyses included in this combination, describes the statistical procedure used, together with the treatment of systematic uncertainties, and summarises modifications to the individual analyses for the combination. Section 4 describes the parameterisation of the measured signal yields in generic terms and reports the results using three distinct parameterisations. Section 5 compares the measured Higgs boson yields to the SM predictions for different production processes and decay modes, and reports the results of a test for the possible presence of multiple mass-degenerate states. Section 6 studies the couplings of the Higgs boson to probe for possible deviations from the SM predictions, using various assumptions motivated in many cases by beyond the SM (BSM) physics scenarios. Finally, section 7 presents a summary of the results.",

It is studied using Pythia8 in ATLAS and Pythia6.4 and Mad-Graph5 aMC@NLO in CMS, for the categories most sensitive to this production process in the various channels. Given that the selection efficiencies of bbH production are similar to those of the ggF process, the latter process is used to model the bbH signal for all decay channels, with an approximate correction to account for the difference in overall efficiency. Table 3 summarises the event generators used by ATLAS and CMS for the \u221a s = 8 TeV data analyses. For each production process and decay mode, the cross section and branching fraction used correspond to the higher-order state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, namely the values given in tables 1 and 2. Furthermore, the p T distribution of the Higgs boson in the ggF process, which in many cases affects categorisation and selection efficiencies, is reweighted to match the HRes2.1 prediction [45][46][47], which accounts for next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) and next-tonext-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) QCD corrections. In addition, the Higgs boson p T spectrum in gg \u2192 H events with two or more jets is reweighted to match the prediction of the Powheg MiNLO H+2-jet generator [91]. This consistent treatment by the two experiments of the most prominent theoretical aspects of Higgs boson production and decay is quite important since all theoretical uncertainties in the various signal processes described in table 3 are treated as correlated for the combination (see section 3). The impact of using different generators for the less sensitive channels is negligible compared to their dominant sources of uncertainty.",

This higher-order accuracy is not necessarily preserved for \u03ba j values different from unity, but the dominant higher-order QCD corrections factorise to a large extent from any rescaling of the coupling strengths and are therefore assumed to remain valid over the entire range of \u03ba j values considered in this paper. Different production processes and decay modes probe different coupling modifiers, as can be visualised from the Feynman diagrams shown in figures 1-6. Individual coupling modifiers, corresponding to tree-level Higgs boson couplings to the different particles, are introduced, as well as two effective coupling modifiers, \u03ba g and \u03ba \u03b3 , which describe the loop processes for ggF production and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. This is possible because BSM particles that might be present in these loops are not expected to appreciably change the kinematics of the corresponding process. The gg \u2192 H and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 loop processes can thus be studied, either through these effective coupling modifiers, thereby providing sensitivity to potential BSM particles in the loops, or through the coupling modifiers corresponding to the SM particles. In contrast, the gg \u2192 ZH process, which occurs at LO through box and triangular loop diagrams (figures 2b and 2c), is always taken into account, within the limitations of the framework, by resolving the loop in terms of the corresponding coupling modifiers, \u03ba Z and \u03ba t . Contributions from interference effects between the different diagrams provide some sensitivity to the relative signs of the Higgs boson couplings to different particles. As discussed in section 6.4, such effects are potentially largest for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, but may also be significant in the case of ggZH and tH production. The ggF production process, when resolved in terms of its SM structure, provides sensitivity, although limited, to the relative signs of \u03ba t and \u03ba b through the t-b interference. The relative signs of the coupling modifiers \u03ba \u03c4 and \u03ba \u00b5 with respect to other coupling modifiers are not considered in this paper, since the current sensitivity to possible interference terms is negligible.",

In the specific case where \u03ba W \u2022 \u03ba t = \u22121, the tHW and tHq cross sections increase by factors of 6 and 13, respectively, so that the tH process displays some sensitivity to the relative sign between the W boson and top quark couplings, despite its small SM cross section.",

Other coupling modifiers (\u03ba u , \u03ba d , and \u03ba e ) are irrelevant for the combination provided they are of order unity. When probing the total width, the partial decay width \u0393 gg is assumed to vary as \u03ba 2 g . These assumptions are not the same as those described for the signal strength framework in section 2.3, so the two parameterisations are only approximately equivalent. The two sets of assumptions have a negligible impact on the measurements reported here provided that the unmeasured parameters do not deviate strongly from unity.",

Such BSM decays can be of three types: decays into BSM particles that are invisible to the detector because they do not appreciably interact with ordinary matter, decays into BSM particles that are not detected because they produce event topologies that are not searched for, or modifications of the decay branching fractions into SM particles in the case of channels that are not directly measured, such as H \u2192 cc. Although direct and indirect experimental constraints on the Higgs boson width exist, they are either model dependent or are not stringent enough to constrain the present fits, and are therefore not included in the combinations. Since \u0393 H is not experimentally constrained in a model-independent manner with sufficient precision, only ratios of coupling strengths can be measured in the most generic parameterisation considered in the \u03ba-framework.",

Most of these analyses examine a specific Higgs boson decay mode, with categories related to the various production processes. They are H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [92,93], H \u2192 ZZ [94,95], H \u2192 W W [96][97][98], H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 [99,100], H \u2192 bb [101,102], and H \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 [103,104]. The ttH production process was also studied separately [78,[105][106][107][108] and the results are included in the combination. The H \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 analysis is included in the combination fit only for the measurement of the corresponding decay signal strength reported in section 5.2 and for the specific parameterisation of the coupling analysis described in section 6.2. It provides constraints on the coupling of the Higgs boson to second-generation fermions, but offers no relevant constraints for other parameterisations. The ATLAS [17] and CMS [18] individual combined publications take into account other results, such as upper limits on the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 decay [109,110], results on VBF production in the H \u2192 bb decay channel [111], constraints on off-shell Higgs boson production [23,24], and upper limits on invisible Higgs boson decays [112][113][114]. These results are not considered further here since they were not included in both combined publications of the individual experiments. In the case of the H \u2192 bb decay mode, the ggF production process is not considered by either experiment because of the overwhelming QCD multijet background. Almost all input analyses are based on the concept of event categorisation. For each decay mode, events are classified in different categories, based on their kinematic characteristics and their detailed properties. This categorisation increases the sensitivity of the analysis and also allows separation of the different production processes on the basis of exclusive selections that identify the decay products of the particles produced in association with the Higgs boson: W or Z boson decays, VBF jets, and so on. A total of approximately 600 exclusive categories addressing the five production processes explicitly considered are defined for the five main decay channels. The exception is H \u2192 bb, for which only the V H and ttH production processes are used in the combination for the reasons stated above.",

Similarly, QCD scale and UEPS uncertainties are assumed to be correlated between the two experiments in the same production processes and to be uncorrelated between different processes. The effects of correlations between Higgs boson branching fractions were determined to be negligible in general, and are ignored in the fits, except for the uncertainties in the branching fractions to W W and ZZ, which are assumed to be fully correlated. When measuring ratios, however, there are cases, e.g. the measurements of ratios of coupling modifiers described in section 4.2, where such uncertainties become the dominant theoretical uncertainties, and in these cases the full branching fraction correlation model specified in ref.

This dependence has an impact only on the measurements of the signal strengths and of the coupling modifiers, in which the SM signal yield predictions enter directly. The associated uncertainties are up to 4% for the signal strengths and 2% for the coupling modifiers. The other source of uncertainty is the dependence of the measured yields on the mass, arising from the fit to the mass spectra in the high-resolution H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ decay channels. In principle, this uncertainty affects all the measurements, including those related to the generic parameterisations, and is expected to be of the same order as the first one, namely 1% to 2%. In practice, since the measured masses in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ decay channels, resulting from the combination of ATLAS and CMS data, agree within 100 MeV, this uncertainty is less than 1% for all combined ATLAS and CMS measurements reported in this paper. Additional uncertainties of approximately 1% in the measurements of the Higgs boson signal strengths and coupling modifiers arise from the uncertainty in the LHC beam energy, which is estimated to be 0.66% at 8 TeV [121]. The uncertainties in the Higgs boson mass and the LHC beam energy are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties in the measurements and are neglected in the following.",

These analyses lead to the most model-independent results presented in this paper and test, with minimal assumptions, the compatibility of the measurements with the SM. The third generic parameterisation is derived from the one described in section 2.4 and is based on ratios of coupling modifiers. None of these parameterisations incorporate any assumption about the Higgs boson total width other than the narrow-width approximation. Some theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties largely cancel in the parameterisations involving ratios but at the current level of sensitivity the impact is small. Table 6 gives an overview of the parameters of interest for the two generic parameterisations involving ratios which are described in more detail in sections 4.1.2 and 4.2. The first row makes explicit that the gg \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ channel is chosen as a reference. The \u03bb Zg = \u03ba Z /\u03ba g term in the fourth row is related to the ratio of the ZH and ggF production cross sections. Once \u03bb W Z = \u03ba W /\u03ba Z is also specified, the VBF, W H, and ZH production cross sections are fully defined. This explains the smaller number of independent parameters of interest in the coupling modifier ratio parameterisation compared to the parameterisation based mostly on ratios of cross sections and branching fractions. In addition, these two parameterisations rely on slightly different assumptions and approximations, which are summarised in sections 2.3 and 2.4. These approximations are due to the fact that one cannot experimentally constrain all possible Higgs boson production processes and decay modes, in particular those that are expected to be small in the SM, but might be enhanced, should specific BSM physics scenarios be realised in nature.",

The cross section times branching fraction for the gg \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ channel is parameterised as a function of \u03ba gZ = \u03ba g \u2022 \u03ba Z /\u03ba H , where \u03ba g is the effective coupling modifier of the Higgs boson to the gluon in ggF production, which in the SM occurs mainly through loops involving top and bottom quarks. The \u03bb Zg = \u03ba Z /\u03ba g parameter is probed by the measurements of VBF and ZH production, while the measurements of the ttH production process are sensitive to \u03bb tg = \u03ba t /\u03ba g . Three of the decay modes, namely H \u2192 W W , H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , and H \u2192 bb, probe the three ratios \u03bb W Z = \u03ba W /\u03ba Z , \u03bb \u03c4 Z = \u03ba \u03c4 /\u03ba Z , and \u03bb bZ = \u03ba b /\u03ba Z , through their respective ratios to the H \u2192 ZZ branching fraction. The remaining decay mode, H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, which in the SM occurs through loops involving predominantly the top quark and the W boson, is sensitive to the ratio \u03bb \u03b3Z = \u03ba \u03b3 /\u03ba Z . In this parameterisation, \u03bb W Z = \u03ba W /\u03ba Z is also probed by the VBF, W H, and ZH production processes. Without any loss of generality, the signs of \u03ba Z and \u03ba g can be assumed to be the same, constraining \u03bb Zg and \u03ba gZ to be positive. Table 10 shows the results of the fit to the data with a breakdown of uncertainties into their statistical and systematic components, while the complete breakdown of the uncertainties into the four components is shown in table 22 of appendix B. The measured correlation matrix can be found in figure 29 of appendix A. The coupling modifiers are assumed to be the same at the two centre-of-mass energies, as in the parameterisation based on the ratios of cross sections and branching fractions. Figure 10 illustrates the complete ranges of allowed values with their total uncertainties, including the negative ranges allowed for \u03bb W Z and \u03bb tg , the two parameters chosen to illustrate possible interference effects due to ggZH or tH production. Figure 11 shows the likelihood scan results for these two parameters for the combination of ATLAS and CMS, both for the observed and expected results. As described in section 2.4, the interference terms are responsible for the small asymmetry between the likelihood curves for the positive and negative values of the parameters of interest. In both cases, the best fit values correspond to the positive sign, but the sensitivity to the interference terms remains small. Appendix C, with the specific example of \u03bb bZ (shown in figure 31), describes how the four possible sign combinations between \u03bb W Z and \u03bb tg may impact the best fit value and the uncertainty in the other parameters of interest. The p-value of the compatibility between the data and the SM predictions is 13%. All results are consistent with the SM predictions within less than 2\u03c3, except those for \u03bb tg and \u03bb bZ , which exhibit deviations from the SM similar to those reported and explained in section 4.1.2 for the measurement of the ratios of the ttH and ggF production cross sections, and of the ratios of the bb and ZZ decay branching fractions.",

Figure 14 shows the 68% CL region for the ten-parameter fit of the five decay channels included in the combination of the ATLAS and CMS measurements. These results are obtained by combining the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data, assuming that \u00b5 f F and \u00b5 f V are the same at the two energies.

This section addresses the case in which the observed signal could be due to the presence of two or more particles with similar masses, such that they cannot be resolved within the current precision of the mass measurements in the different channels. Several BSM models predict, for example, a superposition of states with indistinguishable mass values [122][123][124][125], possibly with different coupling structures to the SM particles. With such an assumption, it may be possible to distinguish between single and multiple states by measuring the cross sections of individual production processes -  Table 15.

Then, for the general case, the other parameters are \u03bb j i = \u00b5 j i /\u00b5 j ggF , whereas for the rank(M) = 1 case the other parameters are \u03bb i = \u00b5 i /\u00b5 ggF . In this section, the index i runs over the VBF, W H, ZH, and ttH production processes and the index j runs over the five decay modes. The two statistical parameterisations are nested since the second one can be obtained from the first by imposing \u03bb j i = \u03bb i . The SM prediction corresponds to the rank(M) =1 case, where \u00b5 j ggF = \u03bb i = \u03bb j i = 1. In contrast to the fits described previously, all the parameters of interest are constrained to be positive for the fits performed in this section. This choice to restrict the parameter space to the physically meaningful region improves the convergence of the fits.

To directly measure the individual coupling modifiers, an assumption about the Higgs boson width is necessary. Two possible scenarios are considered in this section: the first leaves B BSM free, provided that B BSM \u2265 0, but assumes that |\u03ba W | \u2264 1 and |\u03ba Z | \u2264 1 and that the signs of \u03ba W and \u03ba Z are the same, assumptions denoted |\u03ba V | \u2264 1 in the following; the second assumes B BSM = 0. The constraints assumed in the first scenario are compatible with a wide range of BSM physics, which may become manifest in the loop-induced processes of gg \u2192 H production and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. These processes are particularly sensitive to loop contributions from new heavy particles, carrying electric or colour charge, or both, and such new physics can be probed using the effective coupling modifiers \u03ba g and \u03ba \u03b3 . Furthermore, potential deviations from the SM of the tree-level couplings to ordinary particles are parameterised with their respective coupling modifiers. The parameters of interest in the fits to data are thus the seven independent coupling modifiers, \u03ba Z , \u03ba W , \u03ba t , \u03ba \u03c4 , \u03ba b , \u03ba g , and \u03ba \u03b3 , one for each SM particle involved in the production processes and decay modes studied, plus B BSM in the case of the first fit. Here and in section 6.2, the coupling modifier \u03ba t is assumed to be positive, without any loss of generality. Figure 15 and table 17 show the results of the two fits, assuming either |\u03ba V | \u2264 1 and B BSM \u2265 0 or B BSM = 0. In the former case, an upper limit of B BSM = 0.34 at 95% CL is obtained, compared to an expected upper limit of 0.39. The corresponding negative log-likelihood scan is shown in figure 16. Appendix C describes how the two possible sign combinations between \u03ba W and \u03ba Z impact the likelihood scan of B BSM for the observed and expected results, as illustrated in figure 32. The p-value of the compatibility between the data and the SM predictions is 11% with the assumption that B BSM = 0.",

Similarly to section 6.2, it is assumed in this section that there are no new particles in the loops (ggF production process and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode) and that there are no BSM decays, i.e. B BSM = 0. Vector and fermion coupling modifiers, \u03ba V and \u03ba F , are defined such that \u03ba Z = \u03ba W = \u03ba V and \u03ba t = \u03ba \u03c4 = \u03ba b = \u03ba F . These definitions can be applied either globally, yielding two parameters, or separately for each of the five decay channels, yielding ten parameters \u03ba f V and \u03ba f F (following the notation related to Higgs boson decays used for the signal strength parameterisation). Two fits are performed: a two-parameter fit as a function of \u03ba V and \u03ba F , and a ten-parameter fit as a function of \u03ba f V and \u03ba f F for each decay channel. As explained in section 2.4 and shown explicitly in table 4, the Higgs boson production cross sections and partial decay widths are only sensitive to products of coupling modifiers and not to their absolute sign.

The only visible difference between the two minima at positive and negative values of \u03ba f F is observed for the H \u2192 W W channel. As stated above, the channel most affected by the relative sign of the couplings is the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel: because of the negative t-W interference in the \u03b3\u03b3 loop, the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 partial width would be much larger if the sign of \u03ba \u03b3\u03b3 F were opposite to that of \u03ba \u03b3\u03b3 V . When combining the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel with all the other channels, the opposite sign case is excluded by almost 5\u03c3, as can be inferred from figure 25 (f). Figure 26 (top) presents, on an enlarged scale, the results of the scan for the global coupling modifiers as well as those obtained separately for each experiment. For completeness, additional likelihood scans are performed for the two global coupling modifiers and for those of each decay channel, assuming in all cases that \u03ba F and \u03ba V are both positive. The results of these scans are shown in figure 26 (bottom). The most precise determination of \u03ba f F and \u03ba f V is obtained from the H \u2192 W W decay channel because it is the only one that provides significant constraints on both parameters, through the measurements of the ggF and VBF production processes.

The combination of all decay modes provides significant additional constraints. All results are in agreement with the SM prediction, \u03ba f F = 1 and \u03ba f V = 1, and the p-value of the compatibility between the data and the SM predictions is 59%.",

The combination is based on the analysis of approximately 600 categories of selected events, concerning five production processes, ggF, VBF, W H, ZH, and ttH, where ggF and VBF refer, respectively, to production through the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion processes; and six decay channels, H \u2192 ZZ, W W, \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c4 \u03c4, bb, and \u00b5\u00b5. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined Higgs boson mass measurement by the two experiments [22]. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data sets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. This paper presents the final Higgs boson coupling combined results from ATLAS and CMS based on the LHC Run 1 data. The combined analysis is sensitive to the couplings of the Higgs boson to the weak vector bosons and to the heavier fermions (top quarks, b quarks, \u03c4 leptons, and -marginallymuons). The analysis is also sensitive to the effective couplings of the Higgs boson to the photon and the gluon. At the LHC, only products of cross sections and branching fractions are measured, so the width of the Higgs boson cannot be probed without assumptions be-JHEP08 (2016)045yond the main one used for all measurements presented here, namely that the Higgs boson production and decay kinematics are close to those predicted by the Standard Model (SM). In general, the combined analysis presented in this paper provides a significant improvement with respect to the individual combinations published by each experiment separately. The precision of the results improves in most cases by a factor of approximately 1/ \u221a 2, as one would expect for the combination of two largely uncorrelated measurements based on similar-size data samples. A few illustrative results are summarised below.",

            "text": "For the results based on certain coupling modifier parameterisations described in sections 4.2 and 6, it is necessary to account for the relative signs between parameters that JHEP08(2016)045 modify the rates of certain signal production processes and decay modes through interference effects. For example, in the generic parameterisation in terms of ratios of coupling modifiers, the signs of \u03bb Zg , \u03bb W Z , and \u03bb tg affect the rates of tH production through t-W interference, and of ggZH production through t-Z interference. The parameters \u03bb Zg and, as a consequence, \u03ba gZ are assumed to be positive without loss of generality. From this follows that there are four relevant sign combinations of \u03bb W Z and \u03bb tg , which must be evaluated when performing all likelihood scans. An example is given in figure 31 for |\u03bb bZ |, with a separate curve shown for each sign combination. Each sign hypothesis gives rise to a distinct local minimum. As the negative log-likelihood for each case is determined relative to a common reference point, it is possible to identify the global minimum. For this parameterisation, the SM sign hypothesis (\u03bb W Z > 0, \u03bb tg > 0) corresponds to this global minimum. A new negative log-likelihood curve is defined as the envelope of the ones obtained for the different sign hypotheses, by taking the smallest value of \u22122 ln \u039b from the different sign hypotheses as a function of the parameter being considered in the scan. This curve, indicated by the solid line in figure 31, is used to determine the uncertainties and the confidence intervals. In the case of the example chosen here, but also more generally, this procedure results in larger confidence intervals than would be found from the (\u03bb W Z > 0, \u03bb tg > 0) hypothesis alone.",

Given that in this parameterisation, opposite signs of \u03ba W and \u03ba Z are not considered, only two sign combination hypotheses, \u03ba W > 0, \u03ba Z > 0 and \u03ba W < 0, \u03ba Z < 0, are evaluated. In the expected negative log-likelihood curve, a transition between the two hypotheses occurs at B BSM \u2248 0.175. This has the effect of increasing the expected 95% CL upper limit on B BSM from 0.35, when considering only the \u03ba W > 0, \u03ba Z > 0 case, to 0.39, once both sign combinations are considered.",
