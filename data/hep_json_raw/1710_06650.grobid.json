As the characteristic X-rays are internal and short-ranged, the detection efficiency is almost 100%.

The final residual spectrum with L/M-shell X-ray contributions subtracted in the region 0.16-2.5 keVee is shown in Fig. 9(b), together with the exclusion line at m \u03c7 = 3 GeV/c 2 and the spin-independent \u03c7-N cross section \u03c3 SI \u03c7N = 2\u00d710 \u221240 cm 2 by the binned Poisson method [16], which is applied to this residual spectrum in this analysis. The quenching factor is provided by the TRIM program [17], coupled with a 10% systematic error implied by the spread of the measured data at the recoil energy of 254 eV to 10 keV. A standard WIMP galactic halo assumption [18] and conventional astrophysical models [19] are used, with a local WIMP density of 0.3 GeV/cm 3 and a Maxwellian velocity distribution with \u03bd 0 = 220 km/s and escape velocity \u03bd esc = 544 km/s. The energy resolution of the detector is derived from the in situ cosmogenic peaks.",

Accordingly, the physics events are categorized by \"AC \u2212(+) \u2297B r(m) \" and \"AC \u2212(+) \u2297S r(m) \", where the superscript \u2212(+) denotes anti-coincidence(coincidence) with the Ge signals, and B r (m) or S r (m) denotes the bulk or surface count rate after(before) the BS correction. The values of B m and S m just give a reference to show the effectiveness of the Ratio Method in BS selection, and depend on the choice of selection criteria, which is set as \u03c4 < 0.8 \u00b5s for B m (and \u03c4 > 0.8 \u00b5s for S m ) in this analysis.The main contributions to the total error of AC \u2212 \u2297B r at threshold and at a typical high energy bin, are summarized inTable II. Standard error propagation techniques are used to evaluate the combined uncertainties of B r and S r . As discussed in Ref.[11], the statistical errors mainly come from (a) errors at 1-\u03c3 level on f B and f S , calculated from \u03c72 min + 1 for each (E, \u03c4 )-bin; (b) errors of the initial scaling factors (\u03b2 0 i and \u03be 0 i ), calculated from pure bulk/surface regions for every E-bin; (c) errors of correction terms of the final scaling factors after (n \u2212 1) iterations (\u03b2 n\u22121 i and \u03be n\u22121 i ). The systematic uncertainties are evaluated by considering 4 terms: (a) the range of the \"pure\" bulk/surface region ([b 0 , b 1 ] and [s 0 , s 1 ]) is shifted; (b) some B/S calibration sources are removed; (c) rise-time distributions of some sources are shifted deliberately; and (d) the \u03c4 bin-size is changed.",
