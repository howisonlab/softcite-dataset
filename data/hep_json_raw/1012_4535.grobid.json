These electrons are attributed to the decay of W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons, and measured production cross section is consistent with the expectations. The W production is confirmed for the first time in p + p collisions. Its spin asymmetry in the polarized p + p collisions is a important probe for the quark flavor decomposition of the proton spin.",

Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) experiment has been a clear and powerful approach and it is evolved to polarized DIS experiment to explore the spin structure of the proton. Analyses of polarized semi-inclusive DIS experiments [1,2,3] have determined the individual flavor separated quark and antiquark helicity distribution (\u2206q and \u2206q) by connecting final state hadrons with quark flavors using fragmentation functions. Colliding polarized protons is a complementary way to approach the origin of the proton spin. At the collider energy, the real W is produced via a parity violating weak process, which enables to identify the quark flavor and helicity in the proton contributed to the process by detecting decay leptons without the uncertainty of fragmentation functions. Another advantage is, because the scale is set by the heavy mass of the W , higher order QCD corrections can be evaluated reliably.",

In this report, we describe the measurement of the production cross section of W boson and its parity violating single spin asymmetry. The PHENIX detector has been described in detail elsewhere [4]. The central arm spectrometer covers |\u03b7| < 0.35 in pseudorapidity. This analysis uses the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) to measure the energy of electrons and tracking chambers, the drift chambers (DC) and the pad chambers (PC), to determine the charge sign of the tracks from their bend angle in an axial magnetic field. The data set was recorded with the EMCal trigger which has a nominal energy threshold at 10 GeV. The luminosity is monitored by beam-beam counters, those are two arrays of 64 quartz\u010cerenkov counters located at 3.1< |\u03b7| <3.9. Their coincidence rate is connected to the luminosity from the van der Meer scan technique [5]. In the 2009 run, the integrated luminosity of 8.6 pb \u22121 was recorded for the central arm detector analysis.",

In the W event, the electron has high transverse momentum (p T ) and it is isolated unlike high p T track in QCD jet events. The electron energy measured in the EMCal was used to calculate the p T . Because for electrons at momentum of 40GeV/c of our interest, the resolution of the energy in the EMCal is about 5% and it is better than the resolution of the momentum of about 40%. Figure 1 shows the relation between the bend angle, \u03b1, and the transverse momentum for charged tracks after a rough electron selection. Though there are contaminations of hadron backgrounds in the low p T region, the data points are seen to be distributed around the calculation from the magnetic field strength. The resolution of the tracking system was evaluated from the data with no magnetic field. Figure 2 shows the \u03b1 distribution for 40 GeV/c tracks. It is capable to determine the charge sign reasonably. The data with no magnetic field were also used to determine the center of transverse beam position.  To select electron track candidates we applied two levels of criteria. The first one is a minimal track criteria which requires the projected point to the beam to be less than 30 cm, loose cuts on the time of flight, and rough energy-momentum matching. This criteria was used to calculate the production cross section. The second one requires the electron track to be isolated. The threshold was set to the sum of energy and momentum in the cone around the electron candidate track at 2 GeV. This cut purifies the signal fraction. However it is hard to evaluate the cut efficiency, so this sample was only used to calculate the spin asymmetry. Figure 3 shows the p T spectra for positron and electron candidates. The bands represent our estimated background, which are dominated by charged hadrons with hadronic interactions in the EMCal and electrons from photon conversions before the tracking system. In the figure, clear electron signals from the W decay are seen by the Jacobian peak at M W /2 \u2243 40 GeV. It has to be noted that our selection is limited to one hemisphere, so that the signal is a combination of W and Z bosons decay.",

The efficiency for retaining electron candidates after all cuts was 99%. The resulting reconstruction efficiency was not p T dependent for p T > 30 GeV/c. Table 1 shows the production cross sections for electrons and positrons from W and Z boson decays. The first error is statistical; the second error is systematic from the uncertainty in the background; and the third error is a normalization uncertainty. The normalization uncertainty is due to the luminosity (10%), multiple collision (5%), and acceptance and efficiency uncertainties (10%). The results are compared with NLO and NNLO calculations. The difference of the two calculations indicates a level of theory uncertainties. Within the uncertainty, our measurements are consistent with expectations. From theory calculations, the fraction of Z boson contributions to our sample are 7% and 31% for positrons and electrons, respectively. Table 1.

To calculate the spin asymmetry, the sample with the isolation cut was used to minimize the background contamination.

When the confidence interval was calculated, the physical boundary (A L = \u00b11) was applied. With limited statistics, one side of 68% CL and 95% CL hits this physical boundary.
