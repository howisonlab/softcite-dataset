This SU(3) flavor symmetry structure is not well studied in D + meson decays into two-body final states with an \u03b7 (\u2032) , since they are all Cabibbo-suppressed decays. Examples of two-body decays with an \u03b7 (\u2032) in the final state are the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) decays D + \u2192 K + \u03b7 (\u2032) and the singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) decays D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 (\u2032) . The former DCS decays have not yet been observed. The observation of such modes is not only intrinsically important to illuminate the meson decay process but also there is general interest in the experimental technique of measuring an extremely rare decay processes with neutral particles. Observation of D + \u2192 K + \u03b7 (\u2032) would complete the picture of DCS decays for D + mesons decaying to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons.",

The DCS decays D + \u2192 K + \u03b7 (\u2032) together with D + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 can be used to measure the relative phase difference between the tree and annihilation amplitudes (\u03b4 T A ), which is an important piece of information relevant to final-state interactions in D meson decays. Note that experimentally one is able to determine only the tree and annihilation amplitudes and the relative phase difference between them since all decays involving K 0 will be overwhelmed by Cabibbo-favored decays involving aK 0 , with no way to distinguish between them because one detects only a K S [4]. In addition, the most sensitive search for CP violation in D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 (\u2032) decays is reported. Observation of CP violation in D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 (\u2032) decays with current experimental sensitivity would represent strong evidence for processes involving physics beyond the SM [5].",

            "text": "The data used in this analysis were recorded at or near the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector [6] at the e + e \u2212 asymmetric-energy collider KEKB [7]. The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 791 fb \u22121 . We apply the same charged track selection criteria that were used in Ref. [8]. Charged kaons and pions are identified by requiring the ratio of particle identification (PID) likelihoods [8] to be greater or less than 0.6, respectively. For kaons (pions) used in this analysis, the efficiencies and misidentification probabilities are approximately 87% (88%) and 9% (10%), respectively. For the reconstruction of the \u03b7 meson in the D + \u2192 h + \u03b7 decay, where h + refers to either \u03c0 + or K + , we use the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mode instead of the frequently used \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 ) mode since our event selection will include stringent requirements on the vertex formed from charged tracks in the \u03b7 decay. We find that the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode has a small signal to background ratio and poor \u03b7 invariant mass resolution that prohibit the final signal extraction from our data. To reconstruct the \u03b7 \u2032 meson in D + \u2192 h + \u03b7 \u2032 decay, we use the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. The minimum energy of the \u03b3 from the \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 is chosen to be 60 MeV for the barrel and 100 MeV for the forward region of the calorimeter [9]. The decay vertex of the D + is formed by fitting the three charged tracks (h + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) to a common vertex and requiring a confidence level (C.L.) greater than 0.1%. For \u03c0 0 reconstruction in D + \u2192 h + \u03b7, we require the invariant mass of the \u03b3\u03b3 pair to be within [0.12,0.15] GeV/c 2 and for the \u03b7 we require the invariant mass of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 system to be within [0.538,0.558] GeV/c 2 . In the D + \u2192 h + \u03b7 \u2032 mode, to reconstruct the daughter \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 , we require the invariant mass of the \u03b3\u03b3 pair to be within [0.50,0.58] GeV/c 2 . Furthermore, in order to remove a significant \u03c0 0 contribution under the \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 signal peak, we reject \u03b3 candidates as described in Ref. [10]. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass is required to be within the range [0.945,0.970] GeV/c 2 . The momenta of photons from the \u03c0 0 and the \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 combination are recalculated with \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mass [11] constraints, respectively. The invariant mass distributions of the h + \u03b7 (\u2032) system after the initial selection described above are shown in Fig. 1 where there is little indication of signal for either of the DCS modes.",

The first is the angle (\u03be) between the charmed meson momentum vector, as reconstructed from the daughter particles, and the vector joining its production and decay vertices [12]. The second variable is the isolation \u03c7 2 (\u03c7 2 iso ) normalized by the number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f) for the hypothesis that the candidate tracks forming the charmed meson arise from the primary vertex, where the primary vertex is the most probable point of intersection of the charmed meson momentum vector and the e + e \u2212 interaction region [12]. Due to the finite lifetime of D + mesons their daughter tracks are not likely to be compatible with the primary vertex. The third and the fourth variables are the momentum of the \u03b7 (\u2032) (p \u03b7 (\u2032) ) in the laboratory system, and the momentum of the D + in the center-of-mass system (p * D + ). To optimize the selection, we maximize \u01eb sig / \u221a N B where \u01eb sig and N B are the signal efficiency and the background yield in the invariant mass distribution of D + candidates. A uniform grid of 10,000 points in four dimensions spanned by the four kinematic variables described above is used to select an optimal set of selection requirements using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples [13]. Since we use MC samples, this is similar to the importance-sampled grid search technique in Ref. [14]. The optimal selection for the D + \u2192 K + \u03b7 mode is found to be: \u03be < 5 \u2022 , \u03c7 2 iso > 10, p \u03b7 > 1 GeV/c, and p * D + > 3 GeV/c, and",

In order to compute the ratio of branching fractions of DCS modes with respect to SCS modes, the signal efficiencies for the selection criteria described above are estimated with our signal MC. Table I lists all the information used for the branching fraction measurements. The dominant sources of the systematic uncertainty in the branching fraction measurements are the uncertainties of the parameters that are fixed in the fits to DCS decays, and are estimated to be 3.4% (2.1%) for the \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2032 ) mode. These uncertainties are determined by refitting the data with the fit parameters varied by one standard deviation. Other sources include the choice of the fitting functions, estimated to be 2.7% (1.0%) for the \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2032 ) mode, and the uncertainty in the PID, estimated to be 1.1% for the both modes. A summary of the systematic uncertainties for the ratio of branching fraction measurements can be found in Table II. The ratios of branching fractions are B(D + \u2192 K + \u03b7)/B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7) = (3.06 \u00b1 0.43 \u00b1 0.14)% and B(D + \u2192 K + \u03b7 \u2032 )/B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 ) = (3.77 \u00b1 0.39 \u00b1 0.10)%. We use the measurements of the SCS modes from Ref. [15] to calculate the absolute branching fractions. Table III shows the comparison of our branching fractions with the best present limits from Ref. [15]. While the measured branching fraction for the K + \u03b7 mode is in agreement with the SU(3) based expectations [1,2], the K + \u03b7 \u2032 mode is measured to be larger, by approximately three standard deviations.
