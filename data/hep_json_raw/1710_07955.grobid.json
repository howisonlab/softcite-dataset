The components of this background consist of the inclusive production of tt, Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , WW, WZ, ZZ, single top quarks, and, to a lesser extent, W+jets and QCD multijets. The latter two processes contribute when at least one jet is misidentified as a lepton or when a lepton produced within a jet passes the isolation requirement. Their contribution in the dimuon channel is negligible. In the dielectron channel the background arising from W+jets and QCD multijet processes is estimated by fitting the invariant mass distribution in each final bin. The fit is performed using an analytical shape for the W+jets and QCD multijet backgrounds and a simulation-derived shape for the other backgrounds and the signal events that have wrongly reconstructed same-sign dielectrons. Since the processes which generate dielectron pairs in QCD multijets and W+jets are expected to be charge-symmetric, the analytical fit result from the same-sign distribution is used to predict the background in the total sample. This background constitutes approximately 6% of the total background in the dielectron channel. All other backgrounds are estimated using simulated event samples. As indicated in eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), the estimated total background is subtracted bin-by-bin before unfolding the spectra. Figure 1 presents the observed and the expected dielectron and dimuon kinematic distributions. Scale factors have been applied to remove any differences in efficiency between data and simulation as discussed earlier; weights have been applied to match the distribution of pileup vertices in data. The error bars represent the statistical uncertainties for the data and the simulations. The top row displays the q T distribution followed by the \u03c6 * and |y| distributions.

The theoretical uncertainties for powheg, ResBos, and amc@nlo include statistical, PDF, and scale uncertainties. The PDF uncertainty is calculated using the recommendations of refs.

The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) method [69,70], as implemented in ref. [71] is used. The resulting output is unbiased and has minimal variance. The correlations among bins in one channel as well as between the two channels, including those in the unfolding, are taken into account. The correlation between channels originates from the systematic uncertainties due to background estimates, pileup, QED-FSR, and the integrated luminosity. The correlations within one channel also include uncertainties from the lepton efficiencies. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is fully correlated across all bins and both final states. It is evaluated for the final result after combining channels with the BLUE method.    Figure 5. Comparison of theoretical values for the fiducial cross section with the measured value. The grey error bar represents the total experimental uncertainty for the measured value. The error bars for the theoretical values include the uncertainties due to statistical precision, the PDFs, and the scale choice. The fiducial cross section for fewz is obtained by multiplying the total cross section with the acceptance determined from the simulated MadGraph+pythia6 sample; the uncertainty in the prediction corresponds to that in the fewz calculation.",
