More than a dozen experiments using different candidate isotopes and a variety of detection techniques are searching for this decay. Some (EXO-200, Kamland-Zen, GERDA) started to take data recently. EXO and Kamland-Zen have reported first limits of the half life T 0\u03bd 1/2 for 136 Xe. After a decade of little progress in this field, many new results will soon scrutinize the claim from part of the Heidelberg-Moscow collaboration to have observed this decay. The sensitivities of the different proposals are reviewed.",

Since neutrinos have no electric charge, there is no known symmetry which forbids that they mix with their anti-particles. As a consequence double beta decay without neutrino emission (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) might occur as well which is predicted by almost all extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics (see e.g. [4,5]). Its observation would imply that lepton number is violated since only electrons are emitted.",

Schechter and Valle showed that the observation of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 ensures that neutrinos have a Majorana component [16]. Recently it was pointed out that the \"guaranteed\" Majorana mass through radiative corrections is however only in the range of 10 \u221224 eV [17], i.e. negligible compared to the mass scales of neutrino oscillations [15]. Consequently, if 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is observed, other mechanisms like the exchange of supersymmetric particles or heavy Majorana neutrinos might be the dominating process and the known neutrino could even be (effectively) a Dirac particle. While for the initially motivated light neutrino exchange the coupling strength is proportional to m i (Eq. 6), the one for processes with heavy fermion exchange is proportional to 1/M F with M F being the mass of the exchange particle (provided that the helicity of the two leptonic currents are the same and M 2 F > q 2 ). 1 In such processes, lepton number violation or lepton flavor violation can be accessible with accelerator experiments as well [18]. If lower limits on M F from e.g. LHC are higher than typically 10 TeV, then the contributions to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 become smaller than the ones expected from light neutrino exchange with a mass of 0.05 eV [4]. The argument can be turned around: 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 will provide also information on TeV scale physics.",

For example charge exchange reaction measurements of 150 Nd( 3 He,t) and 150 Sm(t, 3 He) [37] result in a quenching factor of 0.75 for the g A coupling and hence a reduction of the matrix element by 25% for 150 Nd [38]. In this calculation, deformation was treated for the first time in a QRPA calculation. For 76 Ge and 76 Se, the proton and neutron valence orbital occupancies have been measured [39,40]. If the models are adjusted to reproduce these values, the ISM result increases by 15% [36] while the QRPA results are reduced by about 20% [41,42]. Hence the difference between ISM and QRPA becomes half as large.",

The A dependent parameters are then the phase space factor, the matrix element and the molar mass. For the comparison it is sufficient to look at the ratio of decay rates and in this case, some of the systematic effects of the matrix element calculations cancel since there are typically correlations among the isotopes for a given method. 2 Fig. 2 shows these ratios for the different models normalized to the decay rate of 130 Te. One sees that 76 Ge is less favorable. The expected decays per kg vary between 20% and 50% of the rate of 130 Te. In other words: if all experimental parameters (number of background events, efficiency, etc.) were the same then one would need a factor of 2-5 more target mass in a 76 Ge experiment to have the same sensitivity. In reality, all experimental parameters like the energy resolution and the background have to considered as well.",

This result can be used to test the claim of Heidelberg-Moscow. For a given matrix element calculation the expected number of signal events for EXO can be estimated from Eq. 8 and 10. The experimental numbers of EXO (32.5 kg\u2022yr exposure, 55% reconstruction efficiency, 4 80.6% enrichment) and Heidelberg-Moscow (28.75\u00b16.86 events, 71.7 kg\u2022yr exposure, efficiency 100%, enrichment 86%) enter. EXO-200 reports n obs = 1 (n obs = 5) events in an energy window of \u00b11 \u03c3 (\u00b12 \u03c3). A Bayesian formulation can be applied with a null hypothesis (H: EXO observes only background) and an alternative hypothesis (H: EXO observes a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal with scaled Heidelberg-Moscow event counts). The priors for the expected number of signal events \u03c0 s and for background events \u03c0 b are Gaussian and the priors for both hypothesis are set to \u03c0(H) = \u03c0(H) = 0.5. Mean and sigma of \u03c0 s are listed in Tab. 2. Mean and sigma of the background are 4.1\u00b10.3 (7.5 \u00b1 0.7) events in the \u00b11 \u03c3 (\u00b12 \u03c3) energy window.The posterior probability is thenp(H) = \u03c0(H) \u2022 p(D|H) \u03c0(H) \u2022 p(D|H) + \u03c0(H)\u1e57(D|H)(11)with p(D|H) = \u03c0 s (x)\u03c0 b (y)P (n obs |x + y) dx dy(12) p(D|H) = \u03c0 b (y|\u03bb b , \u03c3 b )P (n obs |y) dy(13) Here P (n obs |y) is the Poisson function for mean y and n obs observed events. The results for p(H) are listed in Tab. 2. For the T\u00fcbingen-Bratislava calculations (labelled \"QRPA max\" and \"QRPA min\") the maximum and minimum of 20 ratios M 0\u03bd ( 136 Xe)/M 0\u03bd ( 76 Ge) are calculated",
