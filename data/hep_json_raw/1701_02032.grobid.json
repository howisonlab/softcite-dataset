Light boson masses between 5 and 62.5 GeV are probed in final states containing four \u03c4 leptons, two muons and two b quarks, or two muons and two \u03c4 leptons. The results are from data in proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No evidence for such exotic decays is found in the data. Upper limits are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for several signal processes. The results are also compared to predictions of two-Higgs-doublet models, including those with an additional scalar singlet.",

            "text": "bosons, other than that the scalar sector is composed only of doublets and singlets, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC exclude at a 95% confidence level (CL) branching fractions of the Higgs boson to beyond SM (BSM) particles, B(h \u2192 BSM), greater than 49% and 52%, respectively [5,6]. Branching fractions as low as 34% can be excluded at 95% CL by combining the results obtained by the two experiments [4,9]. The LHC experiments are expected to be able to constrain branching fractions to new particles beyond the 5-10% level using indirect measurements [10][11][12]. In this context, it is interesting to explore the possibility of decays of the SM-like Higgs particle to lighter scalars or pseudoscalars [8,[13][14][15]. The SM Higgs boson has an extremely narrow width relative to its mass, because of its exceedingly small Yukawa couplings to the SM fermions it can decay to. This suggests that any non-SM final state is likely to have a larger partial width, and therefore a non-negligible branching fraction, compared to decays to SM particles [8]. Examples of BSM models that provide such additional decay modes include those in which the Higgs boson serves as a portal to hidden-sector particles (e.g. dark matter) that can couple to SM gauge bosons and fermions [16]. Other models have extended scalar sectors, such as those proposed in two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [17][18][19][20][21], in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) [22,23], or in other models in which a singlet Higgs field is added to the SM doublet sector. The NMSSM is particularly well motivated as it provides a solution to the \u00b5 problem associated with supersymmetry breaking, and can provide a contribution to electroweak baryogenesis [24,25].",

            "text": "Both 2HDM and NMSSM may contain a light enough pseudoscalar state (a), which can yield a large h \u2192 aa branching fraction. In 2HDM, the mass of the pseudoscalar boson a is a free parameter, but, if m a < m h /2, fine-tuning of the 2HDM potential is required to keep the branching fraction B(h \u2192 aa) consistent with LHC data [26]. In NMSSM, there are two pseudoscalar Higgs bosons, a 1 and a 2 . Constraints from the Peccei-Quinn [27,28] and R [23,29] symmetries imply that the lighter a 1 is likely to have a mass smaller than that of the h boson [25], and, since it is typically a singlet, suppression of B(h \u2192 a 1 a 1 ) to a level compatible with observations is a natural possibility. The minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) contains a single pseudoscalar (A), but the structure of the MSSM Higgs potential is such that its mass cannot be below about 95 GeV when the scalar (to be identified with h) has mass close to 125 GeV and is SM-like as implied by the LHC data [30]. The phenomenology of decays of the observed SM-like Higgs boson to a pair of lighter Higgs bosons is detailed in refs. [8,[31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] for 2HDM, in refs. [8,[39][40][41][42] in the context of NMSSM or NMSSM-like, and in refs. [8,43,44] in the general case of adding a singlet field to the SM or to a 2HDM prescription.",

At lowest order, there are four types of 2HDM without flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC), which can be characterized through the coupling of each fermion to the doublet structure, as shown in table 1. The ratios of the Yukawa couplings of the pseudoscalar boson of the 2HDM relative to those of the Higgs boson of the SM are functions of tan \u03b2 and of the type of 2HDM, and are given in table 2. Type-1 and type-2 models are the ones commonly considered, and the latter are required in supersymmetric models. In these two cases, the leptons have the same couplings as the down-type quarks. In type-3 2HDM, all quarks couple to \u03a6 2 and all leptons couple to \u03a6 1 , with the result that all leptonic or quark couplings of the pseudoscalar a are proportional to tan \u03b2 or cot \u03b2, so that for large tan \u03b2 the leptonic decays of a dominate.",

If S mixes only weakly with the doublets, one of the CP-even scalars can again have SM-like properties. The addition of the singlet S leads to two additional singlet states, a second CP-odd scalar and a third CP-even scalar, which inherit a mixture of the fermion interactions of the Higgs doublets. After mixing among the spin-0 states, the result is two CP-odd scalars, a 1 and a 2 , and three CP-even scalars, h 1 , h 2 , and h 3 . Of the latter, one can be identified with the observed SM-like state, h. The branching fraction of the h boson to a pair of CP-even or CP-odd bosons can be sizeable, leading to a wide variety of possible exotic h decays. In the 2HDM and its extensions, the ratio of the decay widths of a pseudoscalar boson to different types of leptons depends only on the masses of these leptons.

For each jet, \u03c4 candidates are constructed from the jet constituents according to criteria that include consistency with the vertex of the hard interaction and consistency with the \u03c0 0 mass hypothesis. Two methods for rejecting quark and gluon jets are employed, depending on the analysis. The first is a straightforward selection based on the isolation variable, while the second uses a multivariate analysis (MVA) discriminator that takes into account variables related to the isolation, to the transverse impact parameter of the leading track of the \u03c4 h candidate, and to the distance between the \u03c4 production point and the decay vertex in the case of three-prong decay modes [74]. MVA-based discriminators are implemented to reduce the rates at which electrons or muons are misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates. Muons or electrons from leptonic decays of \u03c4 leptons are indistinguishable from prompt leptonic decay products of W and Z bosons and are reconstructed as described earlier.",

Light boson masses are probed in the range 5\u221215 GeV, where the branching fraction of the light boson to \u03c4 leptons is expected to be large in certain 2HDM models. To illustrate the performance of the analysis, a mass of 9 GeV is chosen as a benchmark model throughout this section; it represents a type-2 2HDM variant in which the pseudoscalar branching fraction to \u03c4 leptons is dominant. The large Lorentz boost of the a boson at such light masses causes its decay products to overlap. To maximize the sensitivity to overlapping \u03c4 leptons, a special boosted \u03c4 \u03c4 pair reconstruction technique is employed, based on the specific final state in which one \u03c4 lepton decays to a muon.

In addition, it must be isolated from other photons, hadrons, and leptons in the detector. Isolation from photons and hadrons is enforced by requiring that the muon relative isolation, as defined in eq. (2.1), is less than 0.12. To be isolated from other leptons, the trigger muon is required to have no identified electrons (p T > 7 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5), muons (p T > 5 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, passing \u03c4 \u00b5 criteria below), or \u03c4 leptons (p T > 10 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.3, passing modified HPS criteria, as described below) reconstructed within \u2206R = 0.4 of the trigger muon direction. The requirement of isolation from nearby leptons, in addition to the isolation requirement of eq.

A slightly wider pseudoscalar mass range is however used for the selection, the optimization aiming at maximum expected signal significance, and the eventual background modeling. In particular, the wider mass range ensures a good description of the background distribution over the entire search region, including regions near the boundaries.

In final states with three muons, the Gaussian component of the profile is found to be negligible, and the signal distributions are parameterized with Breit-Wigner profiles. A fit is performed for every final state and every generated a. To interpolate the signal distributions to any a boson in the studied mass range, the parameters of the fit functions are parameterized as a function of m a by fitting with a third-degree polynomial the parameters of the Voigt or Breit-Wigner profiles obtained from the individual fits. A similar technique is used to interpolate the signal normalization to intermediate mass points; the parameterization leads to yield uncertainties for the signal between 5 and 8% depending on the final state. A closure test that consists of removing a signal sample corresponding to a given mass point from the parameterization of the Voigt and Lorentz fit parameters as a function of the mass, then comparing the parameterization interpolation to the direct fit to this sample, has demonstrated the validity of this technique. The ZZ irreducible background and reducible backgrounds are parameterized with Bernstein polynomials with five and three degrees of freedom respectively. The degrees of the polynomials are chosen to be the lowest that allow for a good agreement between the fit functions and the predicted backgrounds, according to f-tests. Uncertainties in the fit parameters of the Bernstein polynomials for reducible processes are taken into account in the statistical interpretation of results. They dominate over uncertainties associated with the choice of the fitting functions, which are neglected. Uncertainties in the ZZ background distribution are neglected given the low expected yield for this process relative to the reducible background contribution.",

Other systematic uncertainties are detailed in the following subsections, and summarized in table 6.     Systematic uncertainties common to all analyses include the uncertainties in the trigger efficiency (between 0.2 and 4.2% depending on the analysis and on the process), the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies (6% for every \u03c4 h [74], between 0.5 and 1.5% for muons, 2% for electrons), all evaluated with tag-and-probe methods [86] in Drell-Yan data and simulated samples. The uncertainties associated with the data-to-simulation correction factor for the b tagging efficiencies and misidentification rates are also propagated as systematic uncertainties to the final results [73]. Uncertainties in the knowledge of the parton distribution functions [87,88] are taken into account as yield uncertainties, and do not affect the shape of signal mass distributions.

Other sources of systematic uncertainty specific to this search affect the expected signal yield only. When added in quadrature to the background uncertainty, signal yield uncertainties account for at most 6 (10)% of the total uncertainty for m T \u2264 (>) 50 GeV. These minor uncertainties include an additional uncertainty of up to 10% related to the muon isolation if the trigger muon comes from a boosted \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 X topology, as in the ggh, Zh, and VBF production modes, rather than an isolated W leptonic decay, as in the Wh mode. The signal yield is further affected by an asymmetric uncertainty in the \u03c4 charge misidentification probability of \u22121% and +2%. Up to 9.3% uncertainty in the signal yield is considered to account for uncertainties in the m T computation because of uncertainties in the E miss T measurements. The b veto on the seed jet of the \u03c4 X object introduces a maximum of 9.4% uncertainty in the signal yield. Finally, it should be noted that the full MC simulation and event reconstruction were only performed for the ggh and Wh samples with m a = 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 GeV, and for the VBF and Zh samples with m a = 9 GeV. The yields for the VBF (Zh) samples with m a = 5, 7, 11, 13, and 15 GeV were extrapolated from the ggh(Wh) simulated samples at the corresponding pseudoscalar mass, which have similar final state kinematics.

Considering the large look-elsewhere effect [95] caused by the good dimuon mass resolution (about 2%), the wide mass range probed, and the number of studied final states, none of the observed events corresponds to an excess of more than two standard deviations in global significance. In particular, the deviation of the observed limit with respect to the expected limit in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 \u00b1 e \u03c4 \u2213 \u00b5 final state comes from the presence of two observed events with a dimuon mass of 18.4 and 20.7 GeV, respectively, which lead to an excess of events with a maximum local significance of 3.5 standard deviations. Over the full mass range considered, the observed yield in this final state is compatible with the expected background yield of 1.80 \u00b1 0.74 events. The uncertainty bands at low mass for most final states are narrow because of the low expected background yield.",

In 2HDM+S, the branching fractions of the light pseudoscalar a to SM particles depend on the model type and on tan \u03b2. In type-1 2HDM+S, the fermionic couplings all have the same scaling with respect to the SM, whereas in type-2 2HDM+S (NMSSM-like), they are suppressed for down-type fermions for tan \u03b2 < 1 (and enhanced for tan \u03b2 > 1). In type-3 2HDM+S (lepton specific), the decays to leptons are enhanced with respect to the decays to quarks for tan \u03b2 > 1, and in type-4 2HDM+S (flipped), the decays to up-type quarks and leptons are enhanced for tan \u03b2 < 1.",

We compute them following the prescriptions in refs. [8,46]. The branching fractions used to interpret the results in the four particular 2HDM+S scenarios described below are given in table 7. Figure 8 (top left) shows the 95% CL in (\u03c3 h /\u03c3 SM ) B(h \u2192 aa) in type-1 2HDM+S, for which there is no tan \u03b2 dependence. Figure 8 (top right) shows corresponding limits in type-2 2HDM+S with tan \u03b2 = 2; the sensitivity of the h \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u03c4 analyses is improved for m a < 2m b because of the enhancement of the couplings to leptons. The h \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u03c4 and h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u00b52\u03c4 analyses have low sensitivity in type-1 2HDM+S and type-2 2HDM+S with tan \u03b2 = 2 for m a > 2m b , because, in these scenarios, decays to b quarks dominate over decays to \u03c4 leptons and muons. The results in type-3 2HDM+S with tan \u03b2 = 5 are depicted in the bottom left part of figure 8; this scenario provides high sensitivity for the various analyses because of the enhancement of the couplings to leptons over those to quarks. Finally, the limits obtained in type-4 2HDM+S for tan \u03b2 = 0.5 are shown in the bottom right part of figure 8; the choice of tan \u03b2 < 1 ensures large couplings to leptons. Regions where the theoretical predictions for the branching fractions of the pseudoscalar boson to SM particles are not reliable are indicated with grey shaded areas in the figure. To obtain the exclusion limit for h \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u00b5 in these hypotheses, the model-independent limit shown in figure 7 is extrapolated from three mass points (0.25, 2.00, 3.55 GeV) to intermediate masses with a third degree polynomial, before being divided by the square of B(a \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). The variation of the limit around m a = 1.5 GeV, visible in figure 8, is related to an increase of the pseudoscalar boson decay width to gluons because of the change in the number of active flavors in the QCD corrections and in the computation of the running of the strong coupling constant at a renormalization scale equal to m a . The bbh production is neglected in this study. Its yield corresponds to less than 3% of the total production cross section for tan \u03b2 < 5, but could be larger for higher tan \u03b2 values, or due to other new physics effects.",
