The coefficients A and B are functions of \u221a\u015d and of the electroweak vector and axial-vector couplings. In the case that the dilepton system has non-vanishing transverse momentum, p T , the four-momentum of the incoming (anti-)quark is not known, as it is no longer collinear with the incoming beams. The impact of this effect on the asymmetry measurement is minimized by choosing a particular rest frame of the dilepton system, the Collins-Soper (CS) frame [1], in which the angle between the lepton and the quark, \u03b8 * CS , is calculated. The sign of cos \u03b8 * CS is defined with respect to the direction of the quark, which is, however, ambiguous in pp collisions. It is therefore chosen by measuring the longitudinal boost of the final-state dilepton system in the laboratory frame, and assuming that this is in the same direction as that of the quark in the initial state. This assumption leads to a fraction of events with wrongly assigned quark direction, which causes a dilution of the observed asymmetry. The probability of correct quark direction assignment increases with the boost of the dilepton system, thus reducing the dilution for dileptons produced at large rapidities. With this assumption, cos \u03b8 * CS can be written as a function of the lepton momenta in the laboratory frame,",

Using this definition of the effective weak mixing angle, the coupling retains its tree-level form multiplied by the additional factor \u221a \u03c1 f . The relationship between the leptonic and quark sin 2 \u03b8 eff can be approximated as a flavour-dependent shift in the leptonic sin 2 \u03b8 eff [3]. Although the sin 2 \u03b8 eff value from bquarks differs the most from the one from leptons, only a few percent of the events in this analysis come from initial-state b-quarks. In particular, the effect of the quark sin 2 \u03b8 eff on the measured A FB is an order of magnitude smaller than the effect of the leptonic sin 2 \u03b8 eff . This analysis therefore measures the leptonic sin 2 \u03b8 eff , denoted by sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff in the following. Its value is extracted from the measured A FB as a function of the invariant mass of the dilepton system by comparing it to MC predictions produced with varying values of the weak mixing angle.

Final-state radiation from QED is taken into account using PHOTOS [14] in the exponentiated mode with multiphoton emission. For the sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff measurement, where sensitivity to PDFs is expected to be significant, additional PDF sets are also used, including one specifically prepared for this analysis, based on the ATLAS-epWZ12 PDFs [15]. Details are given in section 6. The cross section is calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling using PHOZPR [16] with MSTW2008 NNLO PDFs. The ratio of this cross section to the leadingorder (LO) cross section is the m -dependent K-factor, applied to the generated signal for all plots shown in the following. However, the main observable described here (A FB ) is not affected by this LO-to-NNLO rescaling. The impact of higher-order corrections in \u03b1 s and \u03b1 em on A FB and on sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff is assessed using the HORACEv3.1 [17], MCFMv6.6 [18] and POWHEGv1 [19] generators, as described in section 5. The POWHEG simulation is combined with PYTHIA 6.4 for showering and hadronization.",

When combining one central and one forward electron there is an additional requirement that the central electron be isolated. It is implemented by requiring that the transverse energy deposition in the calorimeter within a cone defined by \u2206R = (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 = 0.2 around the electron candidate be less than 5 GeV, excluding the electron candidate itself.

In the CC electron channel, the electrons are required to have opposite charges. This requirement is not applicable in the CF electron channel, since the forward electron has no charge information.

In the region close to the Z peak, the background contamination is estimated to be less than 1% for the muon and CC electron channels, and about 5% for the CF electron channel. The background contributions in the muon and CC electron channels increase to about 5% and 16% in the low-and high-mass regions, respectively. The CF electron channel has a background contamination of about 30% in the low-mass region. Agreement between data and simulation is observed within the uncertainties over the whole invariant mass range and also in the cos \u03b8 * CS distributions. These uncertainties contain both the statistical and systematic components and include the effects of multiple pp collisions occurring in the same or in neighbouring bunch crossing (pileup), energy/momentum scale and resolution, trigger efficiency, misalignment of the inner detectors, data-driven background estimates, and PDFs.

The unfolding for dilution and the extrapolation from the detector acceptance to the full phase space are performed using the PYTHIA signal sample, where the description of the initial state allows a straightforward definition of the polar angle of the lepton with respect to the quark. The fully corrected asymmetry values for dileptons at the Born level A cor FB are shown in figure 6. The magnitude of the correction is larger than in the previous unfolding step. In addition, the contribution from the PDFs becomes the dominant systematic uncertainty. Good agreement is observed in general between the measured and predicted values. The muon channel measurement exhibits a discrepancy with respect to the PYTHIA prediction for masses above the Z boson mass, where the measured asymmetry is consistently larger than the prediction. This effect could not be explained by the analysis procedure and might be a feature of the simulation. FB values obtained from the reweighted datasets are compared to those obtained from the data, using a \u03c7 2 test over the mass range 70-250 GeV, taking statistical and systematic uncertainties into account. The mass range has been optimized for the maximum sensitivity and stability of the measurement. A parabola is fitted to the resulting distributions of \u03c7 2 values for each channel independently. The minimum of the parabola yields the sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff result. The \u03c7 2 /ndf value at the minimum is 22.4/16 for the CC electron channel, 21.9/16 for the CF electron channel and 22.6/16 for the muon channel. The fit results are found to be stable with respect to the invariant mass range over which the template comparisons are performed, as well as with respect to the sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff range over which the \u03c7 2 is minimized.

The settings for the fit are kept the same as those for the NLO and NNLO fits as much as possible. The main differences between the LO fit and the higher-order fits are that the gluon PDF distribution has a simple parameterization which requires it to be positive definite at all scales, and that the value of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s (m Z ) is set to be higher than the one for the NLO or NNLO fits. A value of \u03b1 s (m Z ) of 0.130 is chosen with a scanning procedure, such that it yields the best level of agreement (\u03c7 2 ) between data and the fit result. This value is consistent with that used by other LO PDF sets. These PDFs are available in LHgrid formats [43].",

The PDF analysis of the ATLAS data also suggests an increased strange-quark sea density (s/d \u223c 1) compared to other PDF sets [15]. In order to probe the sensitivity of this measurement to the enhanced strange-quark density, a dedicated PDF set was prepared with a suppressed strange sea corresponding to uncertainty, which indicates a low sensitivity of the measurement to this effect. This is due to the fact that the sea composition only affects the measurement through the dilution, which, to first approximation, does not change the position of the minimum of the \u03c7 2 in the template fits.",

The data are analysed over a range of dilepton invariant masses from 66 GeV to 1000 GeV in the central-central electron and muon channels, and up to 250 GeV in the central-forward electron channel. The latter includes events where one electron is reconstructed in the forward pseudorapidity range (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9). The forward-backward asymmetry is measured separately for the three channels as a function of the dilepton invariant mass and unfolded for detector effects and final-state radiation. Additionally, a leading-order interpretation which accounts for the effects of dilution and full detector acceptance is presented. The resulting A FB values are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Standard Model predictions.",
