We first corroborate previous per-event total particle yields in \u03a5(1S)\u2192 ggg compared with nearby continuum (e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq) indicating greater (\u223c \u00d72) per-event yields of baryons in 3-gluon fragmentation. We find similar results when we extend that comparison to include the \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) resonances. With higher statistics, we now also probe the momentum dependence of these per-event particle yields. Next, we compare particle production in the photon-tagged process \u03a5(1S) \u2192 gg\u03b3 with that in e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq\u03b3 events, to allow comparison of two-parton with three-parton particle-specific fragmentation. For each particle, we determine the 'enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluon fragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event. Thus defined, an enhancement of 1.0 implies equal per-event production in gluon and quark fragmentation. In the photon-tagged analysis (\u03a5(1S) \u2192 gg\u03b3 compared to e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq\u03b3), we find almost no enhancement for protons (\u223c 1.2 \u00b1 0.1), but a significant enhancement (\u223c 1.9 \u00b1 0.3) for \u039b's. This small measured proton enhancement rate is supported by a study of baryon production in \u03c7 b2 \u2192 gg \u2192 p + X relative to \u03c7 b1 \u2192 qqg \u2192 p + X. Overall, per-event baryon production in radiative two-gluon fragmentation is somewhat smaller than that observed in three-gluon decays of the \u03a5(1S). Our results for baryon production are inconsistent with the predictions of the JETSET (7.3) fragmentation model.",

            "text": "Understanding hadronization, the process by which elementary partons (gluons and quarks) evolve into mesons and baryons, is complicated by its intrinsically non-perturbative nature. Due to the fact that gluons carry two color indices whereas quarks carry only one, the intrinsic gluon-gluon coupling strength (C A =3) is larger than the intrinsic quark-gluon coupling strength (C F =4/3). Radiation of secondary and tertiary gluons is therefore expected to be more likely when hadronization is initiated by a gluon rather than by a quark. This results in a greater number of final state hadrons as well as a larger average transverse momentum in the former case compared to the latter case. In the limit Q 2 \u2192 \u221e, the ratio of the number of hadrons produced in gluon-initiated jets to the number of hadrons produced in quark-initiated jets is expected, in lowest order, to approach a simple color-counting ratio 9/4 [1].",

            "text": "Many experiments have searched for, and found, multiplicity and jet shape differences between quark and gluon fragmentation. At Z 0 energies, qqg events are distinguished by their three-jet topology. Within such events, quark and gluon jets can be separated by a variety of techniques including vertex tagging. Because gluons rarely fragment into heavy quarks, they will produce jets that form a vertex at the e + e \u2212 interaction point. Quark jets, to the contrary, tend to form a detached vertex when the jet contains a long-lived bottom or charm quark. For light-quark events with gluon radiation, however, the assignment of final state hadrons to the initial state partons is generally more ambiguous and often relies on Monte Carlo simulations to determine the fraction of times that an observed hadron is correctly traced to a primary parton. At lower energies, one can exploit the decay characteristics of quarkonium states to directly compare gluon and quark fragmentation using data taken both on-resonance and off-resonance (on the continuum), respectively. The 10 GeV center of mass energy range offers a unique opportunity to probe quark and gluon fragmentation effects, without relying on Monte Carlo simulation to associate the final state hadrons with an initial state parton. CLEO [2] found that the thrust and charged multiplicity distributions of \u03c7 b0 and \u03c7 b2 two-gluon decays are more similar to \u03a5(1S)\u2192 ggg than to continuum e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq events; the reverse was found to be true for \u03c7 b1 \u2192 qqg.",

In these cases, the system recoiling against the photon consists (to lowest order) of hadrons that have evolved from either a two-gluon or a quarkantiquark system. The properties of the recoil systems can then be compared. 1 Additionally, the radiative transitions from the radially excited \u03a5 states to the orbitally excited \u03c7 b triplet offer an opportunity to further probe fragmentation differences between decays of the J=0 and J=2 \u03c7 b states, which decay predominantly to two gluons, vs. decays of the J=1 state. Since the J=1 state is prohibited from decaying into two on-shell gluons, the decay into one hard and one soft, nearly on-shell virtual gluon (gg * , followed by g * \u2192 qq) is kinematically most favored. Statistical correlations between transition photons with inclusive production of particular final-state particles (X) allows a measurement of the relative yields of gg \u2192 X : qq(g) \u2192 X to these species.",

Photon candidates are selected from showers with widths and patterns of energy deposition consistent with those of a photon, as opposed to a neutral hadron (e.g., \u03c0 0 with overlapping photon showers, K 0 L , neutrons, etc.). To ensure that the events are well-contained within the CLEO detector, we require | cos \u03b8 \u03b3 | < 0.707 (\u03b8 \u03b3 defined as before as the polar angle between the beam axis and the direct photon). For p (and p), we require that charged tracks have specific ionizatation (dE/dx) and also RICH information consistent with those expected for protons. For momenta less than 1 GeV/c, we also require that the associated charged track dE/dx information be inconsistent (at the two standard-deviation level, with \u03c3 the momentum-dependent specific ionization resolution) with that expected for true pions. Although this results in a discontinuity in particle identification efficiency at 1 GeV/c, this requirement is necessary to ensure a high-purity sample. For all p and p candidates, we require that p (p) momenta exceed 400 MeV/c to suppress beam-wall and fake backgrounds (i.e. K + and \u03c0 + that pass p identification cuts) and also to eliminate concerns regarding protons ranging out in the beampipe. For reconstruction of \u03c6 (f 2 (1270)) from kaons (pions) we require that pairs of opposite charged tracks with momenta greater than 200 MeV/c (500 MeV/c) have particle identification information consistent with their assumed identities. \u039b's are identified using the standard CLEO algorithms for reconstruction of detached vertices.

In the figure, blue square (gold triangle, green diamond) symbols correspond to enhancements on the 1S (2S, 3S) resonance. Closed symbols are data and open symbols are JETSET 7.3 [20] event generator simulations followed by the full CLEOIII GEANT-based [21] Monte Carlo detector simulation. From the figure we see that the \u03a5's show qualitatively the same behavior for all resonances (1S, 2S, 3S) in both data and Monte Carlo, namely a smooth decrease in enhancement with increasing scaled momentum. We note that the enhancements decrease steadily as one goes from \u03a5(1S) to \u03a5(2S) to \u03a5(3S) and that the data, at all scaled momenta, show significantly greater enhancements than do the Monte Carlo simulations. Figure 4 shows the p and p enhancements. With the exception of the very lowest momentum bin, which is most subject to range-out effects, the consistency between the two indicates that beam-wall and beam-gas backgrounds (which produce an excess of p in the beam) are not substantial. As compared to \u039b enhancements, p and p enhancements are lower and the differences between 1S, 2S, and 3S enhancements (as well as the differences between data and Monte Carlo) are smaller.  Here, we have normalized the resonant production at 9.46 GeV to the continuum production at 10.55 GeV. For \u03c6 production, the lowest momentum bins for the resonance are particularly sensitive to low-momentum kaon acceptance. Figure 5 also shows the f 2 enhancement results binned according to scaled momentum. The f 2 peak is not well-defined at low momentum (lowest two bins). No Monte Carlo comparison is presented since our current Monte Carlo event generator, by default, will not generate f 2 tensor particles. Figure 6 shows the particle enhancements integrated over all momenta for each particle, summarized numerically in Table V . We note that the baryons (\u039b, p, p) have enhancements greater than 1, the \u03c6 meson enhancement is closer to unity, and the production of the tensor f 2 is less than unity over our kinematic acceptance region. Our results are, in general, numerically consistent with the prior CLEO-I analysis, albeit with considerably improved statistical precision. ",

Typical photon tag energies in this case are of order 80-160 MeV. Due to the large \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 backgrounds to such transition photons at these relatively low photon energies, which compromises the statistical power of such tags, the data permit only an extraction of the proton and antiproton enhancements. Of particular interest is the proton yield in \u03c7 b2 vs. \u03c7 b1 decays; the former is expected to be dominated by decays via two gluons, the latter is expected to be dominated by decays to qq(g), with the gluon expected to carry away very little momentum.",

We first conduct a Monte Carlo study to determine the relative efficiency of reconstructing a J=2 transition photon relative to J=1 event, and also the efficiency when we require that a proton be found in addition to the transition photon. We compile statistics on the \u03c7 b ( \u2032 ) \u2192 p(p) + X analyses, separately for J=0/J=1 and for J=2/J=1. For the latter, the overlap of the two observed photon signals results in a highly correlated event yield for the two transitions. We correspondingly extract this ratio from a signal fit to a double Gaussian plus a smooth background. For the former, we simply fit two separate signal Gaussians directly. We find that the efficiency for reconstructing photon-proton correlations in \u03c7 b2 \u2192 gg decays is approximately 95% that for photon-proton correlations in \u03c7 b1 \u2192 qq(g) events.",

We first compare the Monte Carlo enhancements at the event generator-level with those determined after the generated events are processed through the full CLEO-III detector simulation (\"detector-level\"), as a function of momentum. In general, these enhancements will differ for several reasons, including differences in: a) the efficiencies for finding recoil particles in qq\u03b3 vs. gg\u03b3 events resulting from angular distribution, event multiplicity, and particle momentum differences, b) event selection efficiencies, c) \u03c0 0 contamination levels, and d) recoil center-of-mass discrepancies between the continuum data under the \u03a5(1S) resonance vs. the below-\u03a5(4S) continuum. In cases where the generatorlevel and detector-level enhancements are statistically inconsistent with each other at the 2\u03c3 level, we use the ratio between the generator-level and detector-level enhancements as a correction factor and take half of the amount by which this correction deviates from unity as an estimated systematic error. (Note that these corrections have already been incorporated into the results presented in Figures and 6 and 9). Figures 10 and 11 shows the comparison of p enhancements determined at the event-generator vs. post-detector-simulation levels of Monte Carlo simulation.

After reproducing the previously measured per-event baryon production rates in three-gluon decays of the \u03a5(1S) resonance relative to the underlying continuum, we have extended that study to include the other narrow \u03a5 resonances and, with higher statistics, now explicitly examine the momentum dependence of the enhancements for all these states. Integrated over momentum, we observe approximately 5% (10%) lower baryon production per-event for \u03a5(2S) (\u03a5(3S)) decays compared to the vector ground state. Nevertheless, the per-event production of \u039b's for each of the narrow \u03a5 resonances is observed to be greater than twice that of continuum fragmentation at the same center-of-mass energy. We additionally compare, for the first time, particle production in two-gluon vs. quarkantiquark fragmentation. We find, in particular, that baryon production (per event) in twogluon decays is somewhat smaller (\u223c20% for baryons) than that observed in three-gluon decays. For \u039b production, we still observe a significant (\u223c \u00d72) enhancement in two-gluon fragmentation relative to quark-antiquark fragmentation, although the excess enhancement for p is \u226410%. For p, which represent our highest-statistics sample, our results are inconsistent with a model where baryon production in gluon fragmentation is only a function of the available center-of-mass energy; clearly, the number of fragmenting partons is also important, although our measured enhancements fall short of the expectations from a naive independent fragmentation model. Our results, for all measured integrated enhancements are presented in Table V.",

Since \u03a5(4S)\u2192BB \u223c 100%, we expect that any event having a photon with z \u03b3 > 0.5 is a continuum event. Hence, the calculated enhancement should be zero. In all cases, save for p, we find good agreeement between the below-4S continuum particle yields per photon tag, and the on-4S particle yields per photon tag. For p, we find deviations from the null expectation at the level of \u22485-7%, and incorporate these deviations (bin-by-bin in momentum) into our total systematic error for that particular case. For the case of the broad f 2 resonance, sensitivity to our parameterization of the smooth background also contributes a non-negligible systematic uncertainty.",
