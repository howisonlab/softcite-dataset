A low-energy muon neutrino sample (20-100 GeV) containing the oscillation signal was extracted from data collected by DeepCore. A high-energy muon neutrino sample (100 GeV -10 TeV) was extracted from IceCube data in order to constrain the systematic uncertainties. The non-oscillation hypothesis was rejected with more than 5\u03c3. We fitted the oscillation parameters \u2206m 2 23 and sin 2 2\u03b8 23 to these data samples. In a 2-flavor formalism we find \u2206m 2 23 = (2.5 \u00b1 0.6) \u2022 10 \u22123 eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 23 > 0.92 while maximum mixing is favored. These results are in good agreement with the world average values.",

In future, a significant improvement of the resolution of IceCube on the atmospheric neutrino oscillations is expected by the inclusion of the reconstructed neutrino energy in the analysis, by the use of new reconstruction methods which are more efficient at lower energies and by the inclusion of two additional dedicated DeepCore strings which started data taking in May 2011.",
