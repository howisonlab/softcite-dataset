As we mentioned, the target polarisation at AFTER should not cause any specific difficulties. Thanks to the extremely high luminosity of the fixed target modeabove the inverse femtobarn per year -, single-spin asymetries could then be measured with high accuracy, in particular for gluon sensitive probes. This would open the path for systematic studies of the contribution of the gluon motion to the nucleon spin.",
