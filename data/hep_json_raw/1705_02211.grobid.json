            "text": "The rejection of forward jets originating from additional proton-proton interactions (pile-up) is crucial for a variety of physics analyses at the LHC, including Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack of track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| > 2.5. This paper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits jet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions. Measurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set of 3.2 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in the range 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.5 is estimated in simulated events with an average of 22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum and, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between 49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case study is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion process, showing that these techniques mitigate the background growth due to additional proton-proton interactions, thus enhancing the reach for such signatures.",

Therefore, the collisions of proton bunches result not only in large transverse-momentum transfer proton-proton ( pp) interactions, but also in additional collisions within the same bunch crossing, primarily consisting of low-energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. Such additional pp collisions are referred to as intime pile-up interactions. In addition to in-time pile-up, outof-time pile-up refers to the energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeter from previous and following bunch crossings with respect to the triggered event. In this paper, in-time and out-of-time pile-up are referred collectively as pile-up (PU).",

The barrel and endcap sections of the EM calorimeter use liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium and lead absorbers.

The LAr calorimeter read-out [6], with a pulse length between 60 and 600 ns, is sensitive to signals from the preceding 24 bunch crossings. It uses bipolar shaping with positive and negative output, which ensures that the signal induced by out-of-time pile-up averages to zero. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.7, the hadronic (Tile) calorimeter is constructed from steel absorber and scintillator tiles and is separated into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.0) and extended barrel (0.8 < |\u03b7| < 1.7) sections.

This scale factor takes into account the fraction of visible cross-section due to inelastic pp collisions as measured in the data [7] and is required to obtain good agreement with the number of inelastic interactions reconstructed in the tracking detector as predicted in the reweighted simulation.

The additional jets can be classified into two categories: QCD pile-up jets, where the particles in the jet stem mostly from a single QCD process occuring in a single pile-up interaction, and stochastic jets, which combine particles from different interactions. Figure 2 shows an event with a hard-scatter jet, a QCD pile-up jet and a stochastic pile-up jet. Most of the particles associated with the hardscatter jet originate from the primary interaction. Most of the particles associated with the QCD pile-up jet originate from a single pile-up interaction.

Figure 3 shows the fraction of QCD pile-up jets among all pile-up jets, when considering inclusive truth-particle jets. The corresponding distributions for reconstructed jets are shown in Fig. 4. When considering only in-time pile-up contributions ( Fig. 3), the fraction of QCD pile-up jets depends on the pseudorapidity and p T of the jet and the average number of interactions per bunch crossing \u03bc . Stochastic jets are more likely at low p T and |\u03b7| and in harsher pile-up conditions. However, the comparison between Fig. 3, containing inclusive truth-particle jets, and Fig. 4, containing reconstructed jets, suggests that only a small fraction of stochastic jets are due to in-time pile-up. Indeed, the fraction of QCD pile-up jets decreases significantly once out-of-time pile-up effects and detector noise and resolution are taken into account. Even though the average amount of out-oftime energy is higher in the forward region, topo-clustering results in a stronger suppression of this contribution in the forward region. Therefore, the fraction of QCD pile-up jets increases in the forward region, and it constitutes more than 80% of pile-up jets with p T > 30 GeVoverall. Similarly, the minimum at around |\u03b7| = 1 corresponds to a maximum in the pile-up noise distribution [24], which results in a larger number of stochastic pile-up jets relative to QCD pile-up jets. The fraction of stochastic jets becomes more prominent at low p T and it grows as the number of interactions increases. The majority of pile-up jets in the forward region are QCD pile-up jets, although a sizeable fraction of stochastic jets is present in both the central and forward regions.",

Given the evidence presented in Sect. 3 that out-of-time pileup plays an important role for stochastic jets, a direct handle consists of the timing information associated with the jet. The jet timing t jet is defined as the energy-weighted average of the timing of the constituent clusters. In turn, the cluster timing is defined as the energy-weighted average of the timing of the constituent calorimeter cells. The jet timing distribution, shown in Fig. 5, is symmetric and centred at t jet = 0 for both the hard-scatter and pile-up jets. However, the significantly wider distribution for stochastic jets reveals the large out-of-time pile-up contribution. For jets with 20 < p T < 30 GeV, requiring |t jet | < 12 ns ensures that 20% of stochastic pile-up jets are rejected while keeping 99% of hard-scatter jets. In the following, this is always applied as a baseline requirement when identifying stochastic pile-up jets. Stochastic jets can be further suppressed using shape information. Being formed from a random collection of particles from different interactions, stochastic jets lack the char-acteristic dense energy core of jets originating from the showering and hadronization of a hard-scatter parton. The energy is instead spread rather uniformly within the jet cone. Therefore, pile-up mitigation techniques based on jet shapes have been shown to be effective in suppressing stochastic pile-up jets [2]. In this section, the challenges of this approach are presented, and different algorithms exploiting the jet shape information are described and characterized.",

Figure 18 shows the hard-scatter efficiency evaluated in data and simulation. The uncertainties correspond to a 30% uncertainty in the number of pile-up jets and a 10% uncertainty in the number of hard-scatter jets in the signal region. The uncertainties are estimated by comparing data and simulation in the pile-up-and hard-scatter-enriched regions, respectively. The hard-scatter efficiency is found to be underestimated in simulation, consistent with the simulation overestimating the pile-up activity in data. The level of disagreement is observed to be larger at low jet p T and high |\u03b7| and can be as large as about 3%. The efficiencies evaluated in this paper are used to define a calibration procedure accounting for this discrepancy. The uncertainties associated with the calibration and resolution of the jets used to compute fJVT are estimated in ATLAS analyses by recomputing fJVT for each variation reflecting a systematic uncertainty. The fJVT and \u03b3 discriminants correspond to a twofold strategy for pile-up rejection targeting QCD and stochastic pileup jets, respectively. However, as highlighted in Sect. 3, this classification is not well defined as all jets have a stochastic component. Therefore, it is useful to define a coherent strategy that addresses both the stochastic and QCD nature of pile-up jets at the same time. The \u03b3 parameter discussed in Sect. 4 provides an estimate of the p T in the core of the jet originating from the single interaction contributing the largest amount of transverse momentum to the jet. Therefore, the fJVT definition can be modified to exploit this estimation by replacing the jet p T with \u03b3 , so that",

Several other channels are used in the analysis of VBF H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 by ATLAS; the dilepton channel is chosen for this study by virtue of its simple selection and background composition. The dominant background in this channel originates from Z +jets production, where the Z boson decays leptonically, either to electrons, muons, or a leptonically decaying \u03c4 \u03c4 pair. The rate of Z bosons produced in association with two jets satisfying the requirements targeting the VBF topology is extremely low. The requirements include large \u03b7 between the jets and large dijet invariant mass m jj . However, background events with forward pile-up jets often have large \u03b7 and m jj , mimicking the VBF topology.

The fJVT \u03b3 algorithm mitigates the background growth, at the expense of a signal loss proportional to the hard-scatter jet efficiency. 9 Therefore, the degradation of the purity due to pile-up can be effectively reduced. For the specific final state and event selection under consideration, where Z +jets production is the dominant background, this results in about a fourfold improvement in signal purity at \u03bc = 35.",

The ATLAS baseline strategy for identifying and rejecting pile-up jets relies on matching tracks to jets to determine the pp interaction of origin. This strategy cannot be applied for jets beyond the tracking coverage of the inner detector. However, a broad spectrum of physics measurements at the LHC relies on the reconstruction of jets at high pseudorapidities. An example is the measurement of Higgs boson production through vector-boson fusion. The presence of pile-up jets at high pseudorapidities reduces the sensitivity for these signatures, by incorrectly reconstructing these final states in background events.",

The strategy to perform such a task is twofold. First, the information about the jet shape is used to estimate the leading contribution to the jet above the stochastic pile-up noise. Then the topological correlation among particles originating from a pile-up interaction is exploited to extrapolate the jet vertex tagger, using track and vertex information, beyond the tracking coverage of the inner detector to identify and reject pile-up jets at high pseudorapidities. When using both shape and topological information, approximately 57% of forward pile-up jets are rejected for a hard-scatter efficiency of about 85% at the pile-up conditions considered in this paper, with an average of 22 pile-up interactions. In events with 35 pile-up interactions, typical conditions for the LHC operations in the near future, 37, 48, and 51% of forward pile-up jets are rejected using, respectively, topological information, shape information, and their combination, for the same 85% hard-scatter efficiency.",
