This is a transition between 1S states of charmonium, which rate can be easily calculated in potential models. However, for a long time a significant difference between theoretical predictions and experimental data was observed. Until the last year the PDG value of this branching was based on a single measurement [1] of Crystal Ball using an inclusive spectrum of photons in the J/\u03c8 de-cays with the result B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7 c \u03b3) = (1.27 \u00b1 0.36)%, approximately twice less than the theoretical predictions (2.9 \u00b1 0.5)% [2], (2.0 \u00b1 0.8)% [3], (2.4 \u00b1 0.3)% [4], (1.6 \u00b1 1.0)% [5], (2.1 \u00b1 0.4)% [6], (3.05 \u00b1 0.07)% [7]. For comparison, in E1 transitions of charmonium the corresponding difference is (20-30)% only [7], although the matrix element has more complex structure.",

CLEO analysis used exclusive \u03b7 c decays and found that the line shape of this transition is asymmetric. A Breit-Wigner function (BW) alone provides a poor fit to data. A Breit-Wigner modified by E 3 \u03b3 (according to theoretical predictions for electromagnetic dipole transitions) improves the fit near a resonance, but gives a diverging tail at higher photon energies. To suppress this tail CLEO used an additional exponential factor.",

            "text": "In Table 3 systematic errors of our measurements are listed. Systematic error appearing due to the unknown line shape was estimated using various line shapes and fixing \u03b7 c width to the current PDG values (27.4 \u00b1 2.9 MeV). Systematic error related to the background subtraction was estimated by the taking a polynomial of the third order instead of the second in the fit, and varying ranges of the fit. Luminosity measurement error was evaluated from the difference between the measured and calculated number of the multihadron J/\u03c8 decays. Photon detection efficiency is conservatively estimated as 10%. Photon energy scale calibration was made comparing a \u03c0 0 peak position in simulation and data. ",
