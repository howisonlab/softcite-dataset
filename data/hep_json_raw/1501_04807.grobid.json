The test was performed on the entangled neutral kaon pairs, in the \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, studying the interference pattern as a function of sidereal time and particle direction in celestial coordinates. Data reduction is based on two decay vertices with only two tracks each. For each vertex several requirements, invariant mass |m rec \u2212 m K | < 5 MeV, missing mass E 2 miss + | p miss | 2 < 10 MeV, -50 MeV 2 < m 2 miss < 10 MeV 2 , and kaon momenta compatible with the 2-body decay hypothesis, have been applied for the selection of a pure, well reconstructed data sample. The missing momentum is obtained from the analysis of Bhabha scattering events in the same run. A global likelihood function is built in order to kinematically constrain the event and to improve on the event reconstruction quality and in particular on the vertex resolution. Main background source is the kaon regeneration on the spherical beam pipe, suppressed by selecting events with both K S and K L decaying inside the beam pipe, giving at the end of the analysis chain a contamination at 2-3% level. Background contributions and analysis selection efficiencies are derived from MC simulation to which corrections from real data are applied. Full analysis chain was repeated several times varying all the cuts for the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties. The sum in quadrature of all the effects ranges between 30% and 40% of the statistical error. The CPT test is based on the distribution of the difference \u2206\u03c4 in the decay proper time between neutral kaons. Due to the fully-destructive quantum interference at \u2206\u03c4 =0, the distribution is very sensitive to CPT-violating effects, especially for the selected decays inside the beam pipe. Effects of CPT and Lorentz-invariance breaking in the low energy regime relating with modifications of the space-time structure at the Planck scale, are described by the Standard Model Extension, SME [6], providing the parametrization:",

A new precision measurement, at 10 keV level, is desirable to reduce the bias that could arise from the average of the previous results. The ongoing analysis on the KLOE sample of K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + aims to reach a precision of 5-7 keV using 2.5 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + channel is the best suited among kaon dominant decays for a precision measurement of the mass due to the lowest Q-value (Q=75 MeV) that corresponds to the best invariant mass resolution and minimal sensitivity to several bias sources. The candidates are selected through the same procedure applied for the BR measurement (sec.3), changing only the requirements on the number of secondaries at the decay vertex, from 2 to 3, to obtain the 3-pion invariant mass, and on the vertex position, \u03c1 xy \u2265 26 cm, to select decays inside the DC to avoid biases from track extrapolation through the DC walls. On a MonteCarlo sample including all of the \u03c6 decays, to which we apply the same procedure as on real data, we are studying some quality cuts, mostly to reduce the invariant mass distribution tails: i) on the \u03c7 2 of the tracks selected as pion candidates (currently \u03c7 2 \u2264 6); and ii) on the difference between the pion momentum at the first hit in the DC and its extrapolation at the decay vertex (currently (|p Besides the MonteCarlo sample of ( 23,000) K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays analyzed so far, a fast simulation program (toy-MC) has been developed for the evaluation of effects such as i) the presence of radiative decays; ii) bias and asymmetric distribution of the reconstructed pion momentum, p \u03c0 , due for instance to the treatment of energy loss and multiple scattering in the DC; iii) an arbitrary scale affecting p \u03c0 . From these studies we can already rule out any bias on the charged kaon mass from radiative decays. For the evaluation of the momentum scale factor \u03b1 p , the analysis of the charged kaon 2-body decays is in progress. The scale factor gives a bias to the kaon mass that depends on the Q-value of the decay channel, bigger for K \u00b5\u03bd than for K \u03c0\u03c0 and K \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 decays. After correcting for other possible effects (point ii) we can obtain \u03b1 p from the comparison of the 2-body decays. A blind analysis of the invariant mass distribution is in progress on real data ( fig.2). We have obtained 45,000 events after all the analysis chain, with a negligible level of contamination that has been evaluated by the MonteCarlo simulation, B/S 10 \u22124 .",

The upgrade of the KLOE detector consists of the addition of (i) an inner tracker [14,15] based on cylindrical GEM technology for the improvement of tracking and decay vertex resolution close to the interaction point (IP), (ii) a e \u00b1 tagging system [16,17,18] for the \u03b3\u03b3 physics, and (iii) two calorimeters [19,20,21] in the final focusing region to improve acceptance and efficiency for photons coming from the IP and neutral kaon decays inside the detector volume.",
