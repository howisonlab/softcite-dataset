The search is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector in 2016. This is the first search for excited leptons at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The observation is consistent with the standard model background prediction, and the most stringent exclusion limits to date are set on the excited lepton mass and the compositeness scale, at 95% confidence level. Excited electrons and muons are excluded for masses below 3.9 and 3.8 TeV, respectively, under the assumption that the excited lepton mass equals the compositeness scale. The best observed limit on the compositeness scale is obtained with an excited lepton mass of around 1.0 TeV, excluding values below 25 TeV for both excited electrons and muons.",

Notwithstanding its huge success, it does not explain the origin of the mass hierarchy and the number of generations of quarks and leptons. As an attempt to answer such fundamental questions, compositeness of quarks and leptons is introduced in many models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. These compositeness models suggest that quarks and leptons are themselves made of fundamental constituents that are bound by a new strong interaction with a characteristic energy scale \u039b (called the compositeness scale).",

            "text": "An important prediction of compositeness models is the existence of excited states of quarks and leptons. In proton-proton (pp) collisions, excited fermions could be produced via contact interactions (CI) and decay either through SM gauge interactions or via CI to SM fermions. This paper presents a search for excited leptons ( * = e * , \u00b5 * ) in \u03b3 ( = e, \u00b5) final states where the excited lepton decays to a SM lepton and a photon ( * \u2192 \u03b3) as illustrated in figure 1. A clear signature of a same-flavor (SF) lepton pair and a photon allows highly efficient signal selection. However, there is an ambiguity in reconstructing the excited lepton mass because of the two possible pairings of a lepton and the photon. For this search, information of both invariant masses is used to discriminate the excited lepton signal from SM background processes. We consider a benchmark model based on the formalism described in ref. [8]. The effective Lagrangian of four-fermion CI, the main production mechanisms of excited leptons at the LHC, is given by 1) where g * is the coupling constant, which is set to be equal to \u221a 4\u03c0 in the model, and j \u00b5 represents the fermion currents for SM fermions and their excited states, neglecting right-handed currents. In addition, excited lepton decays via SM gauge interactions are described by the corresponding Lagrangian (1.2) where and * denote the lepton and excited lepton fields, and W \u00b5\u03bd and B \u00b5\u03bd are the SU (2) and U(1) gauge fields. The quantities g = e/ sin \u03b8 W and g = e/ cos \u03b8 W represent the corresponding electroweak gauge couplings with the Weinberg mixing angle \u03b8 W , and \u03c4 and Y are the generators of the SU (2) and U (1) groups. The symbols f and f describe the couplings between SM leptons and excited leptons via gauge interactions and are chosen to be equal to 1 in the model. Searches for excited leptons have been previously performed by the CMS collaboration [11,12], but no evidence for their existence was found, excluding m * < 2.5 TeV for the case \u039b = m * . Searches at the LEP [13][14][15][16], HERA [17], and Tevatron [18][19][20][21] colliders, and by the ATLAS collaboration at \u221a s = 7 TeV [22] and 8 TeV [23,24] also found no evidence for the existence of excited leptons, setting lower mass limits of 2.2 and 2.8 TeV for excited electrons and muons, respectively, for the case \u039b = m * .",

Therefore, an appropriate correction must be applied to the estimate of the lepton p T distribution obtained by scaling the control region by a weight factor based on the misidentification rate.
