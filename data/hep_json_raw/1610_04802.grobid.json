Six 2.9-GW th nuclear power reactors of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power facilities served as intense sources of \u03bde's. Comparison of the \u03bde rate and energy spectrum measured by antineutrino detectors far from the nuclear reactors (\u223c1500-1950 m) relative to detectors near the reactors (\u223c350-600 m) allowed a precise measurement of \u03bde disappearance. More than 2.5 million \u03bde inverse beta decay interactions were observed, based on the combination of 217 days of operation of six antineutrino detectors (Dec. 2011-Jul. 2012) with a subsequent 1013 days using the complete configuration of eight detectors (Oct. 2012-Jul. 2015). The \u03bde rate observed at the far detectors relative to the near detectors showed a significant deficit, R = 0.949 \u00b1 0.002(stat.) \u00b1 0.002(syst.). The energy dependence of \u03bde disappearance showed the distinct variation predicted by neutrino oscillation. Analysis using an approximation for the three-flavor oscillation probability yielded the flavor-mixing angle sin 2 2\u03b813 = 0.0841\u00b10.0027(stat.)\u00b10.0019(syst.) and the effective neutrino masssquared difference of \u2206m 2 ee = (2.50\u00b10.06(stat.)\u00b10.06(syst.))\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 . Analysis using the exact three-flavor probability found \u2206m 2 32 = (2.45 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 assuming the normal neutrino mass hierarchy and \u2206m 2 32 = (\u22122.56 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 for the inverted hierarchy.",

            "text": "Recent experiments have resulted in significant advances in our understanding of neutrinos. Although neutrinos were considered massless within the Standard Model, abundant evidence of lepton flavor violation by neutrinos strongly implies small but non-zero masses. A long-standing disparity between measurement and models of the solar \u03bd e flux was corroborated by successive radiochemical [1][2][3] and water-Cherenkov [4,5] experiments. Variation of the ratio of atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e provided initial evidence for distance-dependent neutrino disappearance [6]. Subsequent observation of the disappearance of \u03bd \u00b5 produced in particle accelerators confirmed atmospheric \u03bd measurements [7]. A comparison of the solar \u03bd e to the total solar \u03bd flux showed that the apparent disappearance was a consequence of the conversion of \u03bd e 's to other neutrino flavors [8,9]. Disappearance of \u03bd e 's emitted by nuclear reactors demonstrated a distinct dependence on the ratio of propagation distance to antineutrino energy, L/E \u03bd , cementing neutrino flavor oscillation as the explanation for the observed flavor violation [10].",

            "text": "The rich phenomena of neutrino flavor oscillation arise from two remarkable characteristics of neutrinos: small differences between the masses of the three neutrino states, m 1 = m 2 = m 3 , and an inequivalence between neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates. Produced in a flavor eigenstate by the weak interaction, a neutrino state evolves as a coherent superposition of mass eigenstates. Interference between the phases of each mass component results in the oscillation of the neutrino flavor. The flavor oscillates with phases given by \u2206m 2 ji L/4E \u03bd , where L is the propagation distance, E \u03bd is the neutrino energy, and \u2206m 2 ji = m 2 j \u2212 m 2 i is the difference of the squared masses. The amplitude of flavor oscillation is determined by the amount of mixing between the flavor and mass eigenstates. Using the unitary Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, U PMNS , a neutrino with flavor \u03b1 can be expressed as a combination of mass states, |\u03bd \u03b1 = i U * \u03b1i |\u03bd i . In the three-flavor model, U PMNS is commonly parameterized using three mixing angles, \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 , and an off-diagonal CPviolating phase \u03b4 CP . With sensitivity to the small neutrino mass separations, oscillation experiments have provided strong evidence for three distinct neutrino mass states \u03bd i with masses m 1 , m 2 , and m 3 . Evidence for matter-enhanced resonant flavor conversion of solar neutrinos has shown that \u2206m 2 21 cos(2\u03b8 21 ) > 0. Whether m 3 is much lighter or heavier than m 1 and m 2 , also referred to as the neutrino mass hierarchy, is currently unknown and is the focus of a broad experimental program [11]. Direct measurements of decay kinematics and indirect cosmological observations are currently consistent with massless neutrinos, implying that the absolute masses are less than \u223c1 eV. Neutrino mass qualitatively alters the Standard Model, for example by inhibiting renormalization or by requiring a new global symmetry [12,13].",

This is equivalent to asking whether the parameter \u03b8 13 is nonzero. Solar and reactor experiments have established significant mixing between the \u03bd e and \u03bd 1,2 states, given by sin 2 (2\u03b8 12 ) = 0.846 \u00b1 0.021 [14].

Measurement of \u03b8 13 provides a key parameter of a new Standard Model which incorporates massive neutrinos, and may allow a deeper insight into the flavor and mass structure of nature.

The disappearance signal is most pronounced at the first oscillation minimum of P sur . Based on existing accelerator and atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 measurements of \u2206m 2 32 , this corresponded to a distance L f \u22481.6 km for reactor \u03bd e with a mean energy of \u223c4 MeV. Significant \u03bd e disappearance in the near detectors would have reduced the overall sensitivity of the far-to-near comparison, so L n was kept to \u223c500 m or less. The use of identically-designed modular detectors limited variations in relative number of target protons N p and efficiency between detectors. Situating detectors at a sufficient depth underground reduced muon-induced neutrons and short-lived isotopes, the most prominent backgrounds for reactor \u03bd e detection. Statistical sensitivity increases with \u03bd e flux, target size, and detector efficiency, arguing for the use of intense reactors and large detectors.",

At the time of this measurement the facility consisted of six 2.9 GW th pressurized water reactors and produced roughly 3.5\u00d710 21 \u03bd e /s, making it one of the most intense \u03bd e sources on Earth. Steep mountains adjacent to the reactors provided ample shielding from muons produced by cosmic ray showers. Underground experimental halls were excavated to accommodate 160 tons of fiducial target mass for \u03bd e interactions, equally divided between locations near and far from the reactors. With this arrangement, a total of \u223c2000 \u03bd e interactions per day were detected near to, and \u223c250 far from, the reactors, with muon-induced backgrounds contributing less than 0.5%. The target mass was divided between 8 identicallydesigned modular antineutrino detectors (ADs). Installing at least two ADs in each experimental hall allowed side-by-side demonstration of <0.2% variation in \u03bd e detection efficiency between detectors. A confirmation of the side-by-side performance of the first two ADs was given in [29]. These basic characteristics have yielded measurements of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 with \u223c4% precision and \u2206m 2 ee with \u223c3% precision, as will be discussed in this paper.

Gadolinium (Gd) efficiently captures thermalized neutrons, emitting a few \u03b3-rays with a total energy of \u223c8 MeV per capture. The relatively high capture energy enhanced discrimination of the signal from backgrounds produced by natural radioactivity, primarily at energies 5 MeV. Gd-loading also provided a physical method to fiducialize the detector, allowing efficient rejection of \u03bd e interactions which occurred outside the target volume. The target scintillator was contained within a 3 m by 3 m cylindrical tank, referred to as the Inner Acrylic Vessel (IAV), which was made of UV-transparent acrylic. This was nested within a similar 4 m by 4 m acrylic tank, refered to as the Outer Acrylic Vessel (OAV), which was filled with scintillator without Gd-loading (LS). This outer scintillating region significantly increased the efficiency for detection of gamma rays produced in the target region, reducing systematic uncertainties from effects at the target boundary. Hence, this region was referred to as the gamma catcher. Both regions were nested within a 5 m by 5 m stainless steel vessel (SSV), which was filled with mineral oil (MO). The MO had a density matching that of the LS and GdLS, which balanced stresses across the thin-walled (\u223c1.5 cm) acrylic vessels. It also shielded the scintillating regions from gamma rays from radioactivity in the SSV and PMTs, and provided a transparent medium for propagation of scintillation light to the PMTs. . . .",

After mechanical assembly and testing within a surface assembly building (SAB), each dry AD was transported to an underground liquid scintillator hall for filling. All GdLS was produced in advance and divided equally between the eight ADs in order to ensure a consistent proton and Gd density, as well as optical performance. Each AD target was filled with GdLS from a reservoir mounted on precision weigh-bridge load cells, whose performance was confirmed using calibrated test masses. Drift in the load cell readings over several days provided the dominant systematic uncertainty of \u00b12 kg. An independent measurement used a coriolis flow meter to confirm the relative differences in mass delivered to each AD with few-kg precision, although this instrument measured the absolute mass with far less precision than the load cells. A 0.13% correction accounted for the weight of nitrogen gas which displaced the GdLS within the reservoir during filling. After filling, another correction was made for the small fraction of GdLS present within the calibration tubes and overflow tank, and hence outside of the IAV target volume. Table I summarizes the measured GdLS mass within each IAV target. Subsequent temperature-and pressure-related variation of the AD target masses were determined to within 1.5 l (<0.01%) via precision monitoring of the GdLS levels in the liquid overflow tanks of each detector (see Fig. 23 of [30]). Few-mm fluctuations in level were seen during operation, which corresponded to \u223c6 kg (\u223c0.03%) variations in target mass. The overall 5kg precision of the target mass correction corresponded to a negligible 0.03% systematic uncertainty in the comparison of antineutrino interaction rates among the ADs. Two ADs were immersed in a water Cherenkov muon detector which functioned as both a passive radiation shield and an active muon tag. Tyvek sheets divided the pool into two optically separate detectors, the inner and outer water shields.",

Each electronics channel introduced an additional 3% variation in gain. Since the response of each channel drifts with changing environmental conditions as well as with hardware replacements, a calibration method that operated concurrently with regular antineutrino data collection was developed. In this method, the gain was determined using individual PMT signals uncorrelated with particle interactions within the scintillator. These signals were primarily single photoelectrons from thermal emission, also referred to as PMT dark noise, and were captured by the data acquisition system in the few hundred nanoseconds prior to a particle interaction which triggered a detector. The baseline subtracted charge distributions of these uncorrelated signals for each channel were used to estimate the SPE gain versus time.",

The values of these three parameters which best described the observed distribution S were determined for each PMT. Signals from PMT dark noise were predominantly single photoelectrons, hence the sum was limited to n \u2264 2 without loss of precision. Noise resulted in fluctuations of the distributions below 10 ADC counts, and the results were more stable when this region was not used to constrain the model. Fig. 4 shows an example SPE charge distribution and corresponding model. This procedure was applied to each PMT channel, and Fig. 5 shows the mean charge per SPE averaged over all channels within each AD as a function of time. The typical gain calibration constant was on the order of 19 ADC counts per SPE, although severalpercent differences existed in the average gain between ADs. A slight upwards drift in gain was observed for all detectors. Approximately half of the drift was attributable to changes in temperature of the front-end electronics. PMT aging was considered a potential cause of the remaining drift, and was roughly consistent with the observations presented in [36]. Jumps correlated among the ADs within the same hall were correlated with power-cycling of the PMT high voltage mainframes. An independent method of determining PMT channel gains, based on weekly low-intensity calibration LED data samples, reproduced all of these observed features. ",

In this process, suspect PMT channels were temporarily removed from the analysis due to poor gain, high noise, or other features, as identified by an automated algorithm run concurrently with data collection. The most common cause for disabling a PMT channel was temporary instability in the supplied high voltage. The total number of disabled channels at any one time typically fluctuated around five, combined across all eight detectors, with rarely more than one in a given detector. The absence of a single channel biased the total number of detected photoelectrons within an AD by an average of 1/192 0.5%. Adjusting the observed number of photoelectrons using the simple factor f act (t) = N total /N active (t), where N active is the number of active PMT channels and N total = 192, was found to sufficiently compensate for this bias. This was confirmed by a study where individual PMTs were artificially removed from actual data.

Escape of gamma-rays from the scintillator regions introduced a low-energy tail, which was modeled using a Crystal Ball function for each peak [37]. The resulting energy scale constants obtained with both 60 Co and spallation neutrons can be seen in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, the light yield in all detectors was inversely related to detector age, and the relative variation between detectors was <5% at all times. The observed light yield varied slightly with the particle energy and type, primarily due to the intrinsic nonlinear light emission of the scintillator (see Sec. III D). Given that this variation was very similar for all detectors, it was sufficient to choose the light yield at the 7.95 MeV peak of n-Gd capture as a common convention. Therefore the light yields obtained using the 60 Co source were scaled using the ratio of light yield relative to that from n-Gd capture observed with an 241 Am-13 C neutron source deployed weekly at the detector centers. A clear drift downwards of about 1% to 1.5% per year was seen in the energy scale with both methods, the origin of which has not yet been conclusively identified. The drift was slightly more pronounced when measured with the 60  spallation neutrons, which suggested that the effect was related to a slight degradation of light transmission in the liquid scintillator. The drift resulted in a second-order time-dependent spatial nonuniformity and a negligible degradation in energy resolution, neither of which had a significant impact on the neutrino oscillation analysis discussed here. This conclusion was confirmed by comparing the results obtained with and without applying a calibration correction for this small timedependent drift in the detector nonuniformity. Likewise, it is not expected to compromise the operation of the detectors in the near future.",

Energy stability As discussed in the preceding section, the charge calibration, channel quality, AD light yield, and spatial nonuniformity calibration corrections all varied with time. The performance of the full energy calibration process was assessed by examining the stability of the reconstructed energy over time for a variety of calibration reference data. Figure 10 shows the reconstructed mean energy of spallation neutrons captured on H for the entire period considered in this analysis, for both the 60 Co (Calibration A) and spallation neutron (Calibration B) methods. Both methods yielded an energy for n-H capture that was stable to within 0.2%, as determined from the RMS of the distributions in Figure 10.  b. AD-to-AD differences Calibration was crucial to ensure that the reconstructed energy for antineutrino interactions within all eight antineutrino detectors was as identical as possible. Small differences in the energy response between detectors could distort the relative efficiency of the far versus near detectors, biasing the measurement of \u03b8 13 as highlighted by Eq. 4. Slight distortions of the energy response between detectors could also introduce an artificial distortion in the comparison of the antineutrino energy spectra of the near and far detectors, degrading the measurement of \u2206m 2 ee . AD-to-AD differences were estimated using 13 different calibration references, both deployed and naturally occurring in the ADs.

These changes in liquid level were consistent with a slow leak of 50 l of LS into the 42,800 l MO region of this detector over this two year period (see the description given in section 9.3 of [30]). An increase in the absorbance of short-wavelength light in the MO and an increase in the amount of light detected for muons which traversed the MO verified that a leak had occurred. The increase in light production in the MO region was less than the existing MO Cherekov and scintillation light production, as assessed by muons passing through this region. Light production by natural radioactivity in this region was below detection threshold. This conclusion was supported by the lack of change of the trigger rate for this detector in the period after the leak. Despite close examination of the data from this detector, no significant deviation in performance was found. Simulations which accounted for potential light production in the MO supported this conclusion [39]. As will be discussed, the rate of \u03bd e interactions measured in EH3-AD4 was consistent with the other three detectors in the far hall, which confirmed that the leak did not adversely impact this detector.

The primary purpose of the gammacatcher region surrounding each antineutrino target was to significantly reduce the magnitude of this spectral tail. According to a Geant4-based simulation, the shape of this tail depended on the \u03b3-ray multiplicity and energy distribution from neutron capture on Gd, which was not accurately known. The observed energy spectra from n-Gd capture of neutrons from muon spallation, 241 Am-13 C sources, and IBD interactions were used to constrain potential variations in the simulated n-Gd \u03b3-ray distributions. Based on those simulated \u03b3ray distributions, an absolute efficiency of (92.7\u00b10.97)% was determined for a selection of E d > 6 MeV. The simulation determined \u223c6% of the selection inefficiency was from signals with E d between 3.6 MeV and MeV, which was strongly constrained by data. Simulation predicted an additional \u223c1% inefficiency due to signals with E d < 3.6 MeV, but this estimate was poorly constrained by data due to background from n-H capture in the observed spectra. Assuming a conservative 100% uncertainty on this part of the distribution resulted in a total uncertainty for the E d > 6 MeV selection of 0.97%. The same studies demonstrated that the selection of E d < 12 MeV was 100% efficient.",

            "text": "The rates of uncorrelated signals varied over time for each detector. For the first few months following commissioning of each detector, the prompt-like signal rate R p showed an initial decline of \u223c20% attributed to removal of natural radioactivity during purification of the water in the Water Shields. The rates eventually stabilized in the range of 55 Hz to 60 Hz for all eight detectors. As can be seen in Figure 22, R p was dominated by signals which occurred just above the 0.7 MeV selection threshold. Small changes in the electrical noise environment within each experimental hall would result in slight changes in the efficiency of this threshold. These shifts are consequently visible as slight instability in the rate of accidental background versus time. The delayedlike signal rate R d showed significant differences between experimental halls; a decrease in the muon flux versus hall depth resulted in a corresponding reduction in 12 B production. The neutron production by the 241 Am-13 C sources declined over time, which reduced the delayedlike rate of high-energy \u03b3-rays from this source. During installation of the final two detectors in the summer of 2012, the 241 Am-13 C sources were removed from ACU-B and ACU-C for all detectors in EH3. While reduction of the 241 Am-13 C correlated background was the primary purpose, as will be described in the next section, it had the added benefit of cutting the delayed-like signal rate in half for the far detectors. In summary, each detector initially had about 1000 (EH1), 800 (EH2), and 250 (EH3) delayed-like signals per day, but this has declined by \u223c20% for the near detectors and \u223c65% for the far detectors. Since the rates of uncorrelated signals varied with time, so did the accidental background. Consequently, the data was divided into short intervals in time and the accidental background was independently estimated for each. For selection A, these periods corresponded to every four hours, while for selection B this was once every day. Repeating the selection of \u03bde interactions, but with the time window for selection of the delayed signals offset by 1 ms to 20 ms, enhanced the uncorrelated accidental background (red points) and suppressed correlated signals.",

A minimum offset of 1 ms suppressed correlated signals such as IBD, fast neutrons, and 9 Li, thereby providing a sample enriched in accidental background. Repeating the process with t off from 1 ms to 20 ms in 200 \u00b5s steps increased the statistical precision of this method. Figure 24 shows the distribution of distances between the reconstructed positions of the prompt and delayed signals, \u2206r p,d , for the \u03bd e candidates and for the accidental background determined using this method. Genuine correlated signals favor small \u2206r p,d , as shown by simulation, while accidentals dominate for \u2206r p,d > 2 m. Both the shape and normalization of the accidental background distribution agreed with that of the \u03bd e candidate sample for \u2206r p,d > 2 m, confirming the estimate of this background.

The production of \u03b2-n nuclides by muon spallation in organic liquid scintillator has been measured [42]. 9 Li, with a lifetime of \u03c4 = 257.2 ms and a maximum \u03b2 energy of 13.6 MeV, and 8 He, with a lifetime of \u03c4 = 171.8 ms and maximum \u03b2 energy of 10.7 MeV, are the most prominent \u03b2-n nuclides. A FLUKA-based simulation suggested that the dominant production method was the fragmentation of 12 C by \u03c0 \u2212 in muon-induced hadronic showers, with a relative yield of 10:1 for these two \u03b2-n nuclides [42].",

The high muon rate resulted in a timesince-muon distribution where the time constants for the \u03b2-n background and \u03bd e signal are nearly degenerate. Therefore, an alternate technique was required. Given that \u03b2-n production required nuclear fragmentation, the presence of free neutrons was correlated with unstable nuclide production [44].

When not in use for calibration, these \u223c0.7 Hz neutron sources were withdrawn into each ACU. Concerns about correlated backgrounds motivated the choice and design of the neutron source. For example, 252 Cf was avoided due to the emission of multiple neutrons and associated \u03b3-rays. In the chosen design, \u03b1's from an 241 Am source were degraded using a thin gold foil. With their energy reduced, they were below the threshold for \u03b3-ray production upon interaction with 13 C. Design simulations had demonstrated that there was a negligible probability that a neutron emitted by the withdrawn source would reach the GdLS target and introduce background.",

First, a neutron collided inelastically with an Fe, Cr, Mn, or Ni nucleus, present in the stainless steel of the detector, which emitted prompt \u03b3-rays. The neutron was subsequently captured by a nucleus in the stainless steel, or by Gd present in the GdLS overflow tank, generating delayed \u03b3rays. When an energetic \u03b3-ray from each of these prompt and delayed interactions happened to penetrate into and interact in the scintillator region of the detector, it could mimic a \u03bd e interaction. Initial observation of the background from the 241 Am-13 C sources came from an excess of uncorrelated \u03b3-rays signals above the delayed signal threshold of E rec > 6 MeV. This \u03b3-ray excess had reconstructed positions primarily in the upper half of each detector [49], with a rate and energy spectrum in agreement with simulation. As discussed in Sec. IV B 2, these uncorrelated \u03b3-rays enhanced the rate of accidental backgrounds. Monte-Carlo studies suggested the corresponding correlated background, discussed previously. The detailed modeling of this background is discussed in [50].",

Within the GdLS, the dominant alpha sources are the 238 U, 232 Th, and 227 Ac actinide decay chains. With chemical properties similar to Gd, these nuclides were introduced at trace levels during the scintillator doping process. Each actinide chain contains a polonium cascade decay, which generates a time-correlated pair of \u03b2-\u03b1 or \u03b1-\u03b1 interactions. The half-life of the delayed polonium \u03b1 decay for each actinide chain is 164.3 \u00b5s, 0.3 \u00b5s, and 1.781 ms, respectively. The scintillator quenched the alpha from polonium decay, as discussed in Sec III D, producing a delayed signal with E rec \u2248 1 MeV. Given the low-energy of the delayed signal, it did not mimic a \u03bd e interaction. Instead, the time-correlated signals were used to determine the \u03b1 production rate for each of these actinide decay chains. Figure 30 shows the correlated prompt-delayed energy distributions for various time intervals corresponding to these Po cascade decays. A time interval of 1 to 3 \u00b5s revealed 212 Bi-212 Po decays from the 232 Th decay chain. An interval from 10 to 400 \u00b5s revealed 214 Bi-214 Po decays from the 238 U decay chain.

The measured rates were consistent among all eight detectors.

The offset between the values of \u2206m 2 ee and \u2206m 2 32 was identical to an analytic estimate [67]. Figure 39 compares these estimates to those obtained using the other statistical methods, as well as for the alternate sample obtained using selection B. The slight shift in the estimated value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 for selection B was consistent with statistical uncertainty from those candidate signals uncommon between the two selections. The offsets in the estimated value of \u2206m 2 ee for the methods A, B and E were predominantly caused by the choice of binning of the prompt energy spectrum below 1.3 MeV. These three methods divided the low- The spectra of the detectors in each experimental hall are combined: EH1 (top), EH2 (middle), and EH3 (bottom). The best-fit three-flavor neutrino oscillation model (red line) is determined from the difference in rate and spectrum observed at the far hall relative to the near halls. A prediction with no oscillation (blue line) is obtained from the best-fit model, but with \u03b813 = 0. The inset in semi-logarithmic scale shows the backgrounds. The ratio of the background-subtracted spectra to prediction with no oscillation is shown in the panel beneath each energy spectrum. energy data among multiple bins, while methods C and D combined the data from 0.7 to 1.3 MeV into a single bin. The estimated values for all methods were consistent to 0.1\u03c3 when data below 1.3 MeV was combined into a single bin. Finely-binning the region below 1.3 MeV was also found to sizeably worsen the goodness-of-fit. For example, the \u03c7 2 of method D increased by \u223c43 (\u2206NDF=16) when the spectrum below 1.3 MeV was binned identically to method A, and the shift of the estimated value of \u2206m 2 ee observed by method A was reproduced. Alternatively, increasing the systematic uncertainty of the finelybinned energy spectrum below 1.3 MeV also resolved the discrepancies. These observations indicated that the combined modeling of the large systematics at low energies, including relative energy scale differences and energy loss in the IAV, was insufficient for the case of a finely-binned low-energy spectrum. In contrast, the results had negligible dependence on the choice of binning above 1.3 MeV. Variations were 0.1\u03c3 for \u2206m 2 ee , while those for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 were even smaller.",

Combining 217 days of data collected using six antineutrino detectors with 1013 days of data using eight detectors, a total of 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 \u03bd e inverse beta decay interactions were observed. The unprecedented statistics of this sample allowed the most precise measurement of \u03bd e disappearance to date. A relative comparison of the rates and positron energy spectra of the detectors located far (\u223c1500-1950 m) relative to those near the reactors (\u223c350-600 m) gave sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.0841 \u00b1 0.0027(stat.) \u00b1 0.0019(syst.) and the effective neutrino mass-squared difference of \u2206m 2 ee = (2.50 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 .

The accidental rate primarily depended on experimental hall depth due to the relative rate of unstable isotope production by muons. The decline of the accidental background versus time was due to combination of a decrease in the natural radioactivity following detector installation and a reduction of the neutron emission by the 241 Am-13 C calibration sources. Rp was sensitive to small changes in electrical noise, which resulted in the observed instability in the accidental background rate.
