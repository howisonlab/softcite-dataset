These include important analyses of Higgs boson physics, with the highlight being the first observation of the ttH production of the Higgs boson, along with analyses pertaining to precision standard model measurements, top quark physics, with the single top production cross-section measurement, and flavor physics, with the important observation of \u03c7 b (3P) states. Additionally, important searches for physics beyond the standard model are also presented.",

The CMS experiment had a very successful physics program during the first run (Run 1) of the LHC between 2010 and 2012 with the datasets collected with proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, with the highlight being the discovery of a new particle with a mass of around 125 GeV [2] (also by the ATLAS experiment [3]) that is consistent with the hypothesized Higgs boson, the particle associated with the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Along with the studies related to the Higgs boson, CMS has a diverse physics program covering, but not limited to, precision standard model (SM) measurements, studies with the top quark, flavor physics, and a wide range of searches for physics beyond the standard model (BSM).",

Inside the solenoid, the first sub-detector closest to the point of the collisions is the silicon pixel detector, followed by a silicon strip tracker, with both together forming the tracker system of CMS. Outside the tracker system is the electromagnetic calorimeter that is made up of lead tungstate crystals, followed by the hadronic calorimeter, which is a sampling calorimeter. Outside the solenoid magnet, embedded with the iron return yoke, is the muon system consisting of drift tubes, cathode strip chambers and resistive plate chambers. Additionally, two hadronic forward calorimeters are positioned at either end of CMS to measure particles with a trajectory close to the beam pipe.

After the Run 1 of the LHC (the period of running between 2010 and 2012), there was a period of two years of long shutdown when certain sub-detectors at CMS were upgraded, with the pixel detector upgrade being the most prominent of these. The Run 2 of the LHC started in 2015 and continues through to 2018, with proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and higher instantaneous luminosity than ever before, reaching over 21 Hz/nb. The high instantaneous luminosity presents its own challenges, producing an average of 37 interactions per bunch crossing during the proton-proton collision run in 2017. CMS has been able to record the data and reconstruct it for use in physics analysis with high efficiency, with a total integrated luminosity of 37.76 fb \u22121 recorded out of 40.82 fb \u22121 delivered by the LHC during 2016, and 44.98 fb \u22121 recorded out of 49.79 fb \u22121 delivered during 2017. Of the dataset recorded, a very high fraction of it has been certified as being good for physics analysis where all the relevant detector components were checked to be performing satisfactorily. An even higher amount of data is expected to be collected by the end of 2018. The progression of the amount of data collected by the CMS experiment and the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing of the collisions, which is directly correlated with the instantaneous luminosity, can be seen in Figure 2.

While the predicted cross-section of HH production according to the SM is too low to be probed by the used dataset, several BSM models, such as the two-Higgs-doublet model [20] and its realization within the minimal supersymmetric standard model [21,22] predict an enhancement in the HH production that could be probed with the available dataset. A combination of the measurements in the different channels is done, leading to the setting of an upper limit on the production cross-section at 95% confidence level (CL) observed (expected) to be 21.8 (12.4) times the SM expectation. A search for heavy narrow width resonances (X) decaying to Higgs boson pairs is also performed in the mass range 250 < M X < 3000 GeV.

This search is inspired by models containing dark baryons that could explain the dark matter observed in the universe [48,49]. The search is for events consistent with the pair production of a heavy mediator particle that decays to a light quark and a new fermion, called a dark quark, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 16.1 fb \u22121 from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s =13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. The dark quark gives rise to long-lived dark hadrons via a parton shower, with the resulting emerging jet containing displaced vertices that are created by dark hadron decays to SM hadrons. Feynman diagrams for pair production of mediator particles, with mediator decay to a quark and a dark quark in the BSSW model [48,49] via gluon fusion is shown in Figure 12 (left).",
