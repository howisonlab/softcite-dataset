            "text": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of the charmed baryon spectrum, mainly from the Belle and BaBar experiments [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. In the charmed strange baryon sector, a number of excited states (\u039e * c ) have been observed. Belle reported evidence for two ex-cited states, \u039e c (2980) and \u039e c (3080), in the \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039b + c K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 final states [2]. These states have been confirmed by BaBar [6]. In the same paper, BaBar also claimed evidence for two resonances, the \u039e c (3055) + and the \u039e c (3123) + , observed in the \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 and \u03a3 * ++ c K \u2212 final states. Recently, Belle confirmed the existence of the \u039e c (3055) + , but no evidence was found for the \u039e c (3123) + [9]. As discussed in Refs. [10,11], the decay pattern of charmed baryons provides an important contribution to our understanding of the nature of the states. To date, all measurements of \u039e * c baryons were performed using decays in which the charm quark is contained in the finalstate baryon. Measurements of final states in which the charm quark is part of the final state meson provide complementary information.",

An iron fluxreturn located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [13]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0-cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector was used for the first sample of 156 fb \u22121 , while a 1.5-cm radius beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 824 fb \u22121 [14].",

Also, the invariant mass of a \u039b candidate is required to be within 3 MeV/c 2 of the \u039b mass, which corresponds to \u00b13\u03c3. Excited charmed baryons are known to be produced with much higher average momenta than the combinatorial background. We thus require that x p be greater than 0.7 for the \u039bD + and 0.8 for the \u039bD 0 modes. This requirement removes any possible \u039e * c contribution coming from B meson decays.",

            "text": "S is misidentified as a \u039b. We find this contribution to be negligible because of the proton identification requirement and the difference of the Q-values of K 0 S and \u039b decays. Hereinafter, \u039e * c baryons corresponding to these peaks are referred to as \u039e c (3055) and \u039e c (3080). In order to evaluate the masses, widths, and statistical significances of the \u039e * c states, we apply an unbinned extended maximum likelihood (UML) fit to the mass spectra in the invariant mass range of 3.0\u22123.2 GeV/c 2 . Note that we do not see any contribution from \u039e c (2980) decays in the lower mass region. For the \u039bD 0 mode, the fit is performed simultaneously for the three different D 0 decay modes, with their relative yields fixed using the product of their known branching fractions [19] and detection efficiencies. The masses and widths of the \u039e * c states are constrained to be the same for all modes. The detection efficiencies for the \u039e c (3055) 0 and \u039e c (3080) 0 are found to exhibit no difference within the statistical precision of the MC sample, which is smaller than 1%. Therefore, we use common efficiency values for these states. The relative yields are fixed to K \u2212 \u03c0 + :K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 :K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 = 1.00:1.30:1.15. The probability density functions (PDF) for the \u039e * c components are represented by convolutions of Breit-Wigner shapes with Gaussian distributions to take the intrinsic invariant mass resolution, \u03c3 res , into account. Using the signal MC events, we determine \u03c3 res for the \u039bD + mode to be 1.1 MeV/c 2 for the \u039e c (3055) + and 1.3 MeV/c 2 for the \u039e c (3080) + . In the \u039bD 0 mode, we determine \u03c3 res to be 1.1 and 2.0 MeV/c 2 for the D 0 decay mode without and with \u03c0 0 , respectively for the \u039e c (3055) 0 and 1.3 and 2.2 MeV/c 2 for the \u039e c (3080) 0 . The masses, widths and yields of the \u039e * c states are treated as free parameters. A third-order Chebyshev polynomial is used to model the PDF for the combinatorial background. The statistical significance is evaluated from \u22122 ln (L 0 /L), where L 0 (L) is the likelihood for the fit without (with) the signal component. When we evaluate L 0 for one of the \u039e * c states, the other \u039e * c state is included in the fit. The \u22122 ln (L 0 /L) values are 144.6 for the \u039e c (3055) + , 30.0 for the \u039e c (3080) + , 83.1 for the \u039e c (3055) 0 , and 6.6 for the \u039e c (3080) 0 . By taking into account the change by 3 of the number of degrees of freedom in the UML fit associated with the inclusion of the \u039e * c states, the statistical significances are 11.7\u03c3, 4.8\u03c3, 8.6\u03c3, and 1.7\u03c3 for the \u039e c (3055) + , \u039e c (3080) + , \u039e c (3055) 0 , and \u039e c (3080) 0 , respectively. The peak for the \u039e c (3080) 0 is not statistically significant.",

For the \u039bD 0 mode, r \u03c3 is 1.16, 1.16 and 1.08 for the D 0 final state of K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , respectively. We evaluate the uncertainty by fitting data with \u03c3 res scaled by 16% for all the decay modes. To check the uncertainty on the mass due to a possible mis-calibration of the momentum and energy measurements, we check the reconstructed D 0 masses for both data and signal MC. In each mode, the peak position is observed to have a distinct but small deviation from the world average. However, these deviations are well reproduced by the MC and, because of the mass-constrained fit, have little effect on the determination of the masses of the \u039e * c baryons. In the signal MC, the differences between the input and output masses of the \u039e * c baryons is less than 0.1 MeV/c 2 for all D 0 decay modes. We assign a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 MeV/c 2 on the mass measurements. We perform fits that include the interference of the \u039e c (3055) and \u039e c (3080) assuming both resonances have spin 1/2 and decay in S-wave, which maximize the interference effect. The systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table I. The fit result for the \u039e c (3080) + width is (1.4 \u00b1 1.8) MeV, which is consistent with zero. Therefore, we set a 90% confidence level upper limit on the width. We redo the fit by changing the width; the width for which the likelihood ratio \u22122 ln (L/L 0\u0393 ) is 2.7, where L 0\u0393 is the likelihood with the zero width for \u039e c (3080) + , is assigned as the 90% confidence level upper limit. We obtain the upper limit \u0393 \u039ec(3080) + < 6.3 MeV. The measurements of the masses and widths are summarized in Table II. Note that the final values for the \u039e c (3055) + and \u039e c (3080) + masses and widths in this paper are those combined with \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 and \u03a3 * ++ c K \u2212 decay modes. Values in the \u039bD mode only are shown to compare with other decay modes. We find that the mass of the \u039e c (3055) + and widths of \u039e c (3055) + and \u039e c (3080) + are consistent with our previous measurements with the \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 and \u03a3 * ++ c K \u2212 decay modes [9]. However, we find a small inconsistency for the mass of the \u039e c (3080) + , which may indicate the possible underestimation of the systematic uncertainty for the determination of the masses. We determine the combined value for the masses of the \u039e c (3055) + and \u039e c (3080) + by taking the weighted average. The uncertainty is scaled by \u03c7 2 /(N \u2212 1), where N is the number of different decay modes, which is 2 for \u039e c (3055) + and 3 for \u039e c (3080) + , if the \u03c7 2 /(N \u2212 1) is greater than one; this is the recipe used in Ref. [19]. The scale factor for the \u039e c (3055) + is 1.0 and that for the \u039e c (3080) + is 3.3. The measured mass of the \u039e c (3055) + is (3055.9 \u00b1 0.4) MeV/c 2 and that for \u039e c (3080) + is (3077.9 \u00b1 0.9) MeV/c 2 . The combined values for the widths are determined by simultaneous fit with \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 and \u03a3 * ++ c K \u2212 decay modes as described in the next section.",

For instance, the chiral quark model has been used to identify the \u039e c (3055) as the D-wave excitation in the N=2 shell, and predicts B(\u039e c (3055) \u2192 \u03a3 cK ):B(\u039e c (3055) \u2192 \u039bD) to be 2.3:0.1 or 5.6:0.0, depending on the possible excitation modes [11]. It further identifies the \u039e c (3080) as an S-wave excitation mode of the \u039e c in N=2 shell and predicts that its decay into \u039bD is forbidden. Both of these predictions are in contradiction with our measurements. Further experimental and theoretical work is needed to understand these baryons.    [19,20].

We subtract half of the yield found in the sideband regions because the mass range of the sideband region is double the width of the \u03a3 ++ c signal region. It is difficult to define the \u03a3 * ++ c sideband regions because the maximum mass that is possible for combinations to contribute to the \u039e c (3080) + is only slightly higher than the \u03a3 * ++ c mass, and a low mass sideband would overlap with the \u03a3 ++ c region. Thus, we estimate the contribution under the \u03a3 * ++ c by scaling the yield in the \u03a3 ++ c sideband regions by 2.9, a factor estimated using signal MC. We assume no interference between \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 or \u03a3 * ++ c K \u2212 with non-resonant \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + .

For the fit to the events from the \u03a3 ++ c sideband region, we use the 3.0 \u2212 3.2 GeV/c 2 \u03a3 ++ c K \u2212 mass range. The \u039e * c contributions are represented by a Gaussian-convolved Breit-Wigner with the same mass resolution of the \u039e * c states as that used for the \u03a3 ++ c signal region.
