Muon pairs produced in Drell-Yan process (DY) were detected. Recently, the first ever Transverse Spin Asymmetries (TSAs) measurement in DY has been presented by COMPASS. A complementary analysis of the TSAs weighted by powers of the dimuon transverse momentum q T are presented. In the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) PDF formalism, the qT-weighted TSAs can be written in terms of products of the TMD PDFs of two colliding hadrons, unlike the conventional TSAs, which are their convolutions over quarks transverse momenta. The results are compared in a straightforward way with the weighted Sivers asymmetry in the SIDIS process, released by COMPASS in 2016.",

About 39 000 dimuons pass the event selection. We estimate the background to be at the level of up to 4 % [4]. Several possible systematic effects have been investigated. The major contribution comes from the effect of variation of the datataking conditions within a given period, estimated by measurement of false asymmetries. They are calculated from events with sub-periods or target cells of origin changed in such a way that the physics asymmetries cancel. The combined systematic uncertainty is about 0.7 times the statistical one. In addition, there are normalisation uncertainties of about 5 % from the polarisation measurement and dilution factor calculation. The results are shown on Fig. 1, the q T distribution on Fig. 2.",
