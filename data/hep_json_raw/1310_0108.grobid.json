First, the approach is data-driven. A separate talk at the symposium, by Stephen Parke, was given on neutrino theory, and the reader is referred to this for a more top-down approach to the questions. Second, the emphasis is on highlighting recent experimental ideas which may be new to the LHC community. This necessarily leaves out a large number of exciting, but better-known experiments, however some very good reviews of these are available in Refs. [1,2,3,4,5].",

Other than the facts that at least two neutrino states must have non-zero mass and that the mass spectrum corresponding to the active flavors must be less than \u223c1 eV, we know very little about neutrino masses. Our limited knowledge raises a host of other questions: How far below the upper limits do the neutrino masses lie? Why would the coupling of the Higgs to the neutrinos be more than five orders of magnitude less than the couplings to the charged fermions? Can there be other mass-producing mechanisms at play that lead to this effect? And will neutrinos have the same mass hierarchy as the quark sector, with the small splitting seen at the lowest masses and the large splitting associated with the highest mass? These are all questions we can investigate in the next decade to shine more light on the continuing question of the origin of mass.",

However, this is just a limit in the neutrino sector, and the lightest mass state might be as low as (\u2206m 2 31 ) \u223c 50 meV, leading to a \"desert\" between the fermions of 10 7 eV. As we think about the problem of mass, we must consider what produces such a gap. There are two opposing approaches. One introduces new physics into the \u03bdSM, such as the See-saw Model [11] to motivate the gap. The other argues that the masses are just an accident of nature, like the orbits of the planets, and, as in the case of orbits of planets, gaps happen. However, to push the analogy further, the study of the Mars-Jupiter gap has given interesting insights into the formation of the solar system and potential exo-solar-systems; similarly, even if the specific values of our fermion mass spectrum turn out to be accidents of nature, the origin of this \"gap-feature\" may lead to interesting insights in particle physics.",

The allowed values of m \u03bde in nature depend upon 1) the absolute offset of the neutrino mass states, which is the equivalent of the mass of the lowest state, and 2) the mass hierarchy. To illustrate the point, consider Fig. 1, which is a cartoon of possible values of m \u03bde as a function of absolute offset, where left and right apply to the two hierarchies, shown in inset. If the absolute offset is large with respect to the mass splittings, then there is little difference between the potential m \u03bde values for the two hierarchies-this is called the \"degenerate range.\" However, for smaller values of offset, there is a substantial difference in the range of possible values which must be probed. To see this, consider the inset diagrams, where each bar represents a mass state and the colors indicate the flavor mixings. The mass state \u03bd 3 is defined to have the smallest electron flavor content. The normal hierarchy (left) places \u03bd 3 at the top of the mass spectrum, thus the highest mass state contributes a small weight in Eq. 2. On the other hand, the inverted hierarchy places \u03bd 3 at the bottom, resulting in large electron-flavor content in two high mass states. This inverted arrangement allows an experiment with sensitivity below m \u03bde \u223c 0.05 eV to cover the entire range of potential values.",

In principle, the radiation can be observed with MHz antennae now under development as listening devices for cell phones. The combination of time-of-flight and the frequency of the radiation allows the electrons with energies at the very endpoint of the decay to be isolated and counted.

This is the neutrinoless analogue to the observed process of double beta decay to \u03b2\u03b2\u03bd e\u03bde , which has been observed to occur in the handful of elements where single beta decay is energetically forbidden. In the case of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2, the two antineutrinos annihilate-allowed by their Majorana nature. While it might be surprising to think that total lepton number can be violated in this way, in fact nothing in the SM prevents this.

The basic form is similar to that of m \u03bde from the direct mass searches, with a degenerate region for large absolute offsets and larger average mass expected for inverted rather than normal hierarchy. But the differences in flavor-weighting (compare Eqs. 2 and 3) lead to a spread of potential allowed values in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 case arising because the elements of U can have arbitrary phases. As a result, the allowed regions are wide bands on Fig. 2. An accurate measurement of m \u03bde can allow us to hone in on these CP -violating phases if 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is observed, providing valuable input to Leptogenesis models [14]. The progress in the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is indicated by the yellow shaded region, which are the limits from EXO and KamLAND-Zen [3]. The excluded region becomes pale in the lower regions, indicating the theory error from the calculation of the nuclear matrix element of Xenon. The theory error for all of the potential 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 elements is large. This has led to a set of next generation 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments that employ a range of different elements, so that cross comparison of signals and limits can allow a precise interpretation of the results with less sensitivity to the underlying nuclear theory. The elements include Neodymium (SNO+), Tellurium (CUORE, potentially SNO+), Germanium (GERDA and Majorana) and Xenon (NEXT, as well as continuations of EXO and KamLAND-Zen) [3].",

However, an interesting new step is being pursued by SNO+, to switch from Nd to Te, which may make this experiment the first to pass below the inverted hierarchy in sensitive. This step can be taken because of a very nice synergy among neutrino experiments. A set of recent reactor-based experiments has solved the problem of doping scintillator oil with a high fraction (a few percent) of metal isotopes [15]-research pursued to improve the neutron capture cross section in those experiments. This same technology appears to allow SNO+ to dope with 3% Te.

But before looking for something completely different than in the quark sector, one can also look closely at the \u03bdSM to ask if it is complete. We know that the quark mixing matrix has an arbitrary phase which leads to CP -violation. It is important to ask if such a phase is appearing in the lepton sector also. It would be quite striking if it did not, since this would speak against the dictum of \"that which is not forbidden is compelled.\" It would also be striking if the value were large, the opposite to the quark sector, as that would make the apparent dichotomy between the quarks and leptons even more sharp.

The solid blue line allows both sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and \u2206m 2 atm to float. The result is a rather high value for \u2206m 2 atm , but allowable within errors. However, there is clearly room for models beyond the \u03bdSM, introduced as sub-leading additions, to fit the data.",

The theoretical problem is how to quantify the effect so as to understand whether this is the sole source of baryon asymmetry. Thus, CP violation is a place where experiment is pushing theory as hard as theory often pushes experiment. Two outcomes are particularly interesting: if experimentalists provide a measurement of CP in the neutrino sector that is large, a major contribution to the baryon asymmetry is necessary [14]; and if the CP violation parameter is limited to less than 5 \u2022 , theorists must begin seriously considering how to explain zero CP violation in the lepton sector, when it is observed in the quark sector.",

The classic, or \"conventional,\" approach to studying CP violation is to exploit the change of sign in the oscillation probability by running with neutrinos versus antineutrinos (see Eq. 6). However, an alternative method is to run strictly in either neutrino or antineutrino mode, and instead trace out the oscillation wave, which is modified by a nonzero value of \u03b4. Because non-standard interactions may also be occurring in the neutrino sector, measurements using both approaches is warranted.

Operation of the ESS linac proton beam will start at reduced power in 2019, increasing to the full design power of 5 MW in 2022. To produce the neutrino beam, the 2.5 GeV linear accelerator would be upgraded by another 5 MW, allowing \u223c10 23 protons per year for neutrino production, concurrent with the neutron spallation running. A large water tank Cherenkov detector can be located underground in a mine at a depth of \u223c3000 mwe at two potential locations: Zinkgruvan, which is 365 km from Lund, and Garpenberg, which is 540 km from Lund. These locations offer very similar rock and depths to the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine in Finland that is under consideration for a CERN long baseline program [26].

The ESS experiment (purple) substantially outperforms the other proposed conventional designs (LBNE (green) [29] and T2HK (blue) [30]) due to several factors. First, the low energy of the ESS beam highly suppresses neutral current events in the detector that produce \u03c0 0 's, the principle and pernicious background to \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e measurements. At this energy, the electron-like charged current quasielastic events are straightforwardly separated from the muon-like events in an ultra-large Cherenkov detector, as has been well-established by past experiments [38,32]. Second, while most low energy conventional beams are produced via targeting off axis, which yields a narrow band beam which limits reach in \u03b4, the low energy of the ESS beam provides low proton energy and produces a wide-band beam. Third, if the 540 km ESS baseline is used, then the resulting energy distributuion of the flux allows forthe study of the second oscillation maximum. The CP violating asymmetry is significantly larger at the second maximum than at the first maximum, enhanced by the large value of \u03b8 13 . In contrast, the LBNE and T2HK designs, which were set before \u03b8 13 was measured, were chosen to be most sensitive to the first oscillation maximum.",

The first proposal to pursue this method has been developed by the DAE\u03b4ALUS collaboration [35]. This experiment uses cyclotrons at three sites to produce identical neutrino fluxes from the decay-at-rest of pions and muons. Events from the near cyclotron site allows constraint of the initial flux. The middle and far sites then allow the shape of the oscillation wave to be accurately measured. The useful flux from decay at rest beams range from 20 to 50 MeV, and thus this is a very short baseline experiment, with the sites located at < 1.5, 8 and 20 km. A\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e signal can be detected in a large detector with free proton targets (water or scintillation) via inverse \u03b2 decay (IBD), \u03bd e + p \u2192 e + n). In the case of a water detector, in order to observe the neutron capture, Gd-doping, as is presently done in the EGADS experiment [33] is required. Thus, this experiment could use the same detector as is planned for ESS. Other detectors under consideration are HyperK (water) [30] and LENA (scintillator) [34]. Fig. 4, red, shows the DAE\u03b4ALUS capability for a 10 year run [35]. While this sensitivity was calculated for running DAE\u03b4ALUS with the Hyper-K design, the result when paired with ESS will be very similar. This capability is similar to that of the ESS proposal, and both approach the measurement of \u03b4 in the quark sector (gray band). The combination can take the measurement of \u03b4 beyond a simple measurement, to a strong test of the potential presence of non-standard interactions.",

The results arise from short baseline accelerator, reactor and source experiments [38,39,40,41], and include both neutrinos and anti-neutrino scattering, electron and muon flavors, and more than two orders of magnitude in energy range. Models which introduce one, two or three sterile neutrinos, referred to as \"3+1\", \"3+2\", or \"3+3,\" respectively, have been introduced to explain the data [42]. Global fits have identified ranges in this extended parameter space where the anomalies can be reconciled in the 3+2 and 3+3 cases [43].",

The DAE\u03b4ALUS experiment described above could be used to generate a pion DAR beam for such a measurement. However, a proposal which uses the DAE\u03b4ALUS injector cyclotron, called IsoDAR, can come on line much more quickly and produce a definitive result. This design uses protons from the injector cyclotron to produce neutrons, which then capture on 7 Li to generate an isotope DAR source. Positioned next to a kiloton-scale scintillator detector such as KamLAND, one can search for sterile neutrinos by observing a deficit of antineutrinos as a function of the distance L and antineutrino energy E across the detector [44].",

[4], presents possible allowed masses and Yukawa couplings of sterile neutrinos within seesaw models.

The richness of particle physics as a field can be seen by the way these two very different approaches to experiments push the community toward new ideas and questions. Figure 6.
