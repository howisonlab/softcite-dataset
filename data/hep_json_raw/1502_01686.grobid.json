Product branching fractions for the radiative decays of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) to scalar resonances f0 (1370, 1500, 1710, 2100, and 2200), and tensor resonances f2(1270, 1525, and 2230) have been determined, and are discussed in relation to predicted glueballs. For \u03c8(2S) radiative decays the search for glueballs has been extended to masses between 2.5 GeV and 3.3 GeV.",

Its predictions for hadronic phenomena at high energies have received remarkable experimental confirmation, and it is an integral part of the Standard Model of particle physics. In contrast, at lower energies the success of QCD has been comparatively limited. This is mainly due to the fact that while at high energies reliable predictions can be made in perturbative QCD (pQCD) models, at low energies pQCD predictions are unreliable, and lattice calculations with the required precision are in many cases not yet available.",

            "text": "Predictions for glueball spectra have been made in bag models [6], QCD-based potential models [7], QCD sum rules [8], and lattice gauge calculations [9][10][11][12][13]. Lattice gauge calculations have supplanted most other predictions. The lattice calculations of Refs. 10,11, and 12 were done in the quenched approximation with no quarks, and their predictions are in general agreement with each other. The first unquenched lattice calculations with 2 + 1 flavor sea-quarks have been reported by the UKQCD Collaboration [13]. They obtain results for the masses of the 0 ++ , 0 \u2212+ , and 2 ++ glueballs which are in good agreement with the lattice predictions of Refs. 10 and 12 in the quenched approximation, and conclude that they \"find no evidence of strong unquenching effects\". Thus, the results of Ref. 12, reproduced in Fig. 1, can be considered as representative of lattice predictions so far. The order of the lowest lying glueballs is as anticipated by Fritzsch and Minkowski [2], with the prediction for the first scalar (0 ++ ) and tensor (2 ++ ) glueball masses are G(0 ++ 1 ) = 1710(50)(80) MeV, G(2 ++ 1 ) = 2390(30)(120) MeV. These are followed by five heavier glueballs with masses less than M (\u03c8(2S)). These are 0 \u2212+ (2560(35)(120) MeV), 1 +\u2212 (2980(30)(140) MeV), 2 \u2212+ (3040(40)(150) MeV), 3 +\u2212 (3600(40)(170) MeV), and 3 ++ (3670(50)(150) MeV). In the present paper, our glueball search is limited to masses less than 3.3 GeV, below the masses of the \u03c7 cJ resonances of charmonium.",

With the realization that the predicted glueballs have masses close to those of normal qq mesons with the same quantum numbers with which they must mix, the more realistic searches aspire to identify states which contain substantial glueball content in their wave functions. Searches for such states have been based mainly on three expectations. These are: (a) for a given J P C , the glueball state is \"supernumary\", i.e. a state in excess of the expected number of qq states, e.g., the nonet of 0 ++ SU (3) states, (b) a pure glueball state does not decay preferentially to states containing up, down, or strange quarks, i.e., \"pure\" glueball decays to pseudoscalar pairs should have equal branching fractions for each available charged state. Thus decays to \u03c0\u03c0, KK, \u03b7\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 , should have branching fractions proportional to 3 : 4 : 1 : 1 : 0, and (c) certain decays are particularly favorable for populating glueballs, e.g., pp annihilation, and radiative decays of vector states of quarkonia, J/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03a5, to \u03b3gg . . ., where g stands for gluons.

Radiative decays of J/\u03c8 have been studied by Crystal Ball [14], Mark III [15,16], DM2 [17], and BES [18][19][20]. Among the latest of these are BES measurements of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) [18] and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(K + K \u2212 , K 0 S K 0 S ) [20] with 58 million directly produced J/\u03c8 in e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8. The invariant mass spectra in the decays of these directly produced J/\u03c8 contain large backgrounds due to ISR production of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and KK\u03c0 0 with one missing photon which simulate \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b3K + K \u2212 decays.

Because of the well known anomalously small branching fractions for the decays \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and K * K, the \u03c1 bands and the K * bands seen in J/\u03c8 decays are not seen in the corresponding \u03c8(2S) Dalitz plots.

An overall presentation of these is made in Fig. 9. Several gross features are apparent in this figure. The first feature is the general similarity in the observed spectra for J/\u03c8 radiative decays (left five panels) and \u03c8(2S) radiative decays (right five panels). The yields for \u03c8(2S) decays are lower. As mentioned earlier, this is mainly the consequence of the well-known \"13% rule\" of pQCD which stipulates that the hadronic and radiative decays of \u03c8(2S) have nearly a factor seven smaller widths compared to those of J/\u03c8, a ratio which follows that for the leptonic decays. The second feature is the expected similarity between the corresponding charged and neutral final states, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , and K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S . We find that resonance masses determined from charged and neutral spectra are always in agreement within their statistical errors. However, the mass resolution and statistics is better for the charged final states, as expected. This leads to our decision to make resonance mass determinations from the charged decay spectra, and to fix them for the final analysis of the neutral decay spectra. The limited event statistics also does not allow us to make partial wave analysis of the data. One additional observation is that the yields for radiative decays to the \u03b7\u03b7 final states, though suggestive of the population of f to keep resonance widths also free, and they were fixed at their PDG values [26]. The instrumental resolution widths, as given in Table II, were convolved with the PDG widths to obtain the peak shapes used in the fits.",

However, its mere existence is considered questionable. As a result, PDG (2014) estimates the mass of f (1370) to be in the range of 1200 \u2212 1500 MeV and its width to be between 300 \u2212 500 MeV.

Since the well-known resonance f 0 (1500) is expected in the same tail region, it is difficult to assign the observed bump uniquely to either f 0 (1370) or f 0 (1500), This problem was also noted by Belle [27].

As noted before, we do not have enough statistics to fit the observed structures keeping both the mass and width of this resonance free. We therefore assume five different values of the width, \u0393 = 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 MeV, and fit the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 spectrum for the best value of the mass corresponding to each assumed value of the width.

The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 spectrum leads to the mass M (f 0 (1710)) = 1744(7) MeV and B 1 \u00d7 B 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u00d7 10 5 = 27.9 (25), and the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 spectrum leads to B 1 \u00d7 B 2 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) \u00d7 10 5 = 9.3 (16), with the sum B 1 \u00d7 B 2 (\u03c0\u03c0) \u00d7 10 5 = 37.2 (30).

The background is generally much larger than in the lower mass regions. This makes resonance assignments in this mass region rather speculative.

These arise due to the production of \u03c1(770) and \u03c6(1020) vector mesons via initial state radiation. To confirm this, we have analyzed our off-\u03c8(2S) resonance data at \u221a s = 3671 MeV with the integrated luminosity of 20.6 pb \u22121 . To compare the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 yields observed in these data with those observed in \u03c8(2S) data we multiply the yields by the relative luminosity factor L(\u03c8(2S))/L(3671) = 53/20.6 = 2.57, and the factor (s \u2032 /s) 3 = (3686/3671) 3 = 1.06. The normalized yields are shown in Fig. 12 superposed on the \u03c8(2S) data. It is seen that the normalized contributions fully account for the yield of \u03c1(770) in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 spectrum, and for the yield of \u03c6(1020) in the K + K \u2212 spectrum.

            "text": "While the main interest in glueball searches has been in the scalars, special interest has existed in the claim for a narrow tensor state with mass \u223c 2230 MeV, and width \u0393 \u2248 20 \u2212 30 MeV. This claim has a checkered history. Originally claimed by Mark III [15] in the radiative decay of J/\u03c8, and the decay of \u03be(2230) into K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S , it has gone through several claimed observations [15,18,28], and a number of nonobservations [17,21,[29][30][31]. The latest of these consist of its observation by ITEP in \u03c0 \u2212 p formation and decay into K 0 S K 0 S [28], and its non-observation by BaBar in the radiative decay of J/\u03c8 into K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S [31], and its non-observation by BES III in the radiative decay of J/\u03c8 and decay into \u03b7\u03b7 [21]. The present measurement allow us to search for it in the radiative decays of both J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), with its decays into \u03c0\u03c0, KK, and \u03b7\u03b7 pseudoscalar pairs. In the analyses of the invariant mass spectra as described above, we add a resonance with M = 2230 MeV, and widths of 20 and 50 MeV, and determine upper limits at 90% confidence level for the product branching fractions for the existence of \u03be(2230). The results are listed in Table V. They can be summarized as upper limits of \u2264 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in J/\u03c8 decays and < 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 in \u03c8(2S) decays. Our limits in J/\u03c8 decays are consistent with \u2264 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 reported by DM2 [17] for K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S decays, and \u2264 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 reported by BaBar [31] in K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S decays. No evidence for its existence was found by BES III in radiative decay of a very large sample of 2.25 \u00d7 10 8 J/\u03c8 to \u03b7\u03b7 [21]. In Table VI we compare the results for all resonances observed in the radiative decays of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) to pairs of charged and neutral pseudoscalars. Several features are notable in Table VI.",

The values for \u03c0\u03c0, KK, and \u03b7\u03b7 decays listed in Table VII lead to the ratios below:  (15) \u03c7 c0 decays (divided by phase space factor p) = 1.00(5) 1.47(9) 0.36(4) 0.27 (3) 0.02(1) \u03c7 c2 decays (divided by phase space factor p 5 ) = 1.00(5) 1.18(8) 0.28(4) 0.058(34) 0.010 (22) The branching fraction ratios for \u03c7 c0 decays are seen to agree within experimental uncertainties with the theoretical expectations for 2-gluon decays.

We estimate uncertainties due to reconstruction and particle identification as follows. We find a reconstruction uncertainty of 1% per charged particle, with an additional 1% and 2% per identified \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 , respectively, for the use of dE/dx and RICH information. We find a K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 identification uncertainty of 1%. We also find uncertainties of 2% per \u03c0 0 and 2% for the radiative photon. We add the contributions for each mode in quadrature to obtain the systematic uncertainties for this source. We estimate the uncertainty in our requirement that the kinematic fit have \u03c7 2 < 25 by analyzing data with the requirements \u03c7 2 < 20 and \u03c7 2 < 30, and we take the largest variations as the systematic uncertainty due to this source. In resonance fits, our fixed parameters are the Breit-Wigner widths of the resonances and the MC-determined mass resolution. To estimate the uncertainties due to the fixed resonance widths, we refit the data, varying the widths by \u00b11\u03c3 of their PDG values [26], and we take the largest variation for each resonance as the systematic uncertainty due to this source. We also refit the data with the MC-determined mass resolution varied by \u00b110%, and find that this has no measurable effect our results, since the resonances in our fits are all much wider than the mass resolutions. The uncertainty due to the backgrounds in the fits is obtained by varying background normalization by \u00b11\u03c3 around the central value obtained from the fits.
