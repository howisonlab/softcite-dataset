A 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio of nonresonant production is set at 2.2 pb, while the expected limit is 1.0 pb. The difference derives from a modest excess of events, corresponding to 2.4 standard deviations from the background-only hypothesis. The limit observed in the search for a narrow X \u2192 hh resonance ranges between 0.7 and 3.5 pb as a function of the resonance mass.",

Despite the lack of deviations from SM predictions, the Higgs boson h offers a rich potential for new physics searches. This Letter reports on searches for non-SM physics with events consistent with either resonant (X \u2192 hh) or nonresonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the hh \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3bb channel.",

However, a variety of extensions to the SM predict an enhancement of Higgs boson pair production. In two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) [9][10][11] the heavier of the neutral scalar Higgs bosons H may decay to a pair of its lighter scalar partners, h. Depending on the parameters of the 2HDM, the H \u2192 hh production cross section may exceed a picobarn [11]. A deviation of the Higgs boson self-coupling \u03bb hhh from the SM predicted value could also increase the nonresonant production rate. Such deviations could be observed with future data sets [8]. Larger enhancements in the pp \u2192 hh rate could arise from the top-Higgs quartic tthh coupling predicted in composite models [12,13], or from the addition of light colored scalars to the SM [14]. Resonant production of two Higgs bosons could appear from the production and decay of gravitons, radions, or stoponium [15][16][17], as well as from a hidden sector mixing with the observed Higgs boson [18].",

The SM hh process is too small to observe with current data sets, but the SM kinematics are used to model generic nonresonant beyond-SM physics. Both models are generated using MADGRAPH5 [30,31] and CTEQ6L1 PDFs. A generator filter requires a pair of b quarks and a pair of photons in each event. PYTHIA8 is used to decay the two Higgs bosons, and to shower and hadronize the events. The implementation of SM Higgs boson pair production includes the interference between diagrams with trilinear Higgs boson couplings and box diagrams. For the SM hh process, which is a background to the resonance search, the next-to-leading-order inclusive production cross section of 9.2 fb is taken from Ref. [8]. Resonant samples are generated with a width of 10 MeV (corresponding to a narrow width approximation) at masses m X \u00bc 260, 300, 350, and 500 GeV.

Before reconstructing the four-object mass, m \u03b3\u03b3bb , a scaling factor of m h =m bb is applied to the four-momentum of the bb system, where m h is set to the value of 125 GeV used in simulation. This improves the m \u03b3\u03b3bb resolution by 30%-60% depending on the mass hypothesis, without biasing or significantly altering the shape of the background.

These requirements vary linearly with the mass m X of the resonance considered. The width of the signal window varies from 17 GeV at m X \u00bc 260 GeV to 60 GeV at m X \u00bc 500 GeV. The acceptance for the continuum background to pass this requirement, \u03f5 m \u03b3\u03b3bb , also varies with m X .

Because there are no heavy flavor quarks at lowest order associated with ggF or VBF production, additional uncertainties are evaluated for these higher-order processes. These uncertainties are derived from a comparison of simulated predictions to data for similar initial states: gluon-initiated production of tt with heavy flavor [49] for ggF, and quark-initiated W boson production with heavy flavor [50] for VBF. Since the ggF and VBF contributions are less than 15% of the expected single Higgs boson yield in the signal region, the net impact of these uncertainties remains small.

This represents the fraction of events where an upward variation of the photon resolution causes the diphoton mass to leave the m h AE 2\u03c3 m \u03b3\u03b3 window required for the signal region. The uncertainty on m h impacts the peak position in m \u03b3\u03b3 in the signal plus background fit of the nonresonance analysis, and in the resonance search it is transformed into a 1.7% uncertainty on the number of signal events in the mass window.
