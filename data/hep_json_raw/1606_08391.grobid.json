The search is performed in events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W boson, giving rise to a signature of a lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum, and multiple jets from b-quark decays. The analysis is based on the full dataset of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . No significant excess of events above the Standard Model prediction is observed, and a 95% confidence-level upper limit is derived for the product of the production cross section for pp \u2192 W H times the branching ratio for the decay H \u2192 aa \u2192 4b. The upper limit ranges from 6.2 pb for an a-boson mass m a = 20 GeV to 1.5 pb for m a = 60 GeV.",

These measurements could uncover deviations from expected Standard Model (SM) branching ratios or allow for the possibility of decays into non-SM particles. Existing measurements constrain the non-SM or \"exotic\" branching ratio of the Higgs boson decays to less than approximately 30% at 95% confidence level (CL) [3][4][5]. Exotic decays are predicted by many theories of physics beyond the SM [6], including those with an extended Higgs sector such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [7][8][9][10][11], several models of dark matter [12][13][14][15][16], models with a first-order elece-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch troweak phase transition [17,18], and theories with neutral naturalness [19][20][21].",

Several searches have been performed for H \u2192 aa. The D0 and ATLAS Collaborations have searched for a signal of H \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u03bc2\u03c4 in the a-boson mass ranges 3.7 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 19 GeV and 3.7 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 50 GeV, respectively [24,25].

            "text": "The result presented in this paper covers an unexplored decay mode in searches for H \u2192 aa by considering a \u2192 bb. The a-boson can be either a scalar or a pseudoscalar under parity transformations, since the decay mode considered in this search is not sensitive to the difference in coupling. An example of a model with predominant a \u2192 bb decays is one where the new scalar mixes with the SM Higgs boson and inherits its Yukawa couplings [6]. This search focuses on the pp \u2192 W H process, with W \u2192 \u03bd ( = e, \u03bc) and H \u2192 2a \u2192 4b in the range 20 GeV < m a < 60 GeV. The resulting signature has a single lepton accompanied by a high multiplicity of jets originating from a bottom quark (b-jets). Since the b-jets are produced from the decay of the Higgs boson, they tend to have low transverse momentum ( p T ) compared to m H and can be overlapping, especially for light a-bosons. Events with an electron or muon, including those produced via leptonically decaying \u03c4 -leptons, are considered. The W H process is chosen for this search because the charged lepton in the final state provides a powerful handle to efficiently trigger and identify these events against the more ubiquitous background process of strong production of four b-jets. Several kinematic variables, including the reconstructed masses in the decay H \u2192 2a \u2192 4b, are used to identify signal events. The background estimation techniques, systematic uncertainties and statistical treatment closely follow those used in other ATLAS searches with similar signatures [33][34][35][36].",

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid magnet producing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and an external muon spectrometer incorporating three large toroid magnet assemblies. The inner detector consists of a high-granularity silicon pixel detector, including the newly installed insertable Blayer [38], and a silicon microstrip tracker, together providing precision tracking in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, complemented by a transition radiation tracker providing tracking and electron identification information for |\u03b7| < 2.0. The electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeter uses lead as the absorber material and liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. Hadron calorimetry is also based on the sampling technique, with either scintillator tiles or LAr as the active medium, and with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. The scintillator tile calorimeter is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.0) and end-cap (0.8 < |\u03b7| < 1.7) regions, and the LAr hadronic calorimeter includes an end-cap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and a forward (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) region. The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muons with |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers in a toroidal field of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T in the central and endcap regions of ATLAS, respectively. The muon spectrometer is also instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system, consisting of a custom-hardware level followed by a software-based level, 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r ,\u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). is used to reduce the event rate to a maximum of around 1 kHz for offline storage [39].",

Furthermore, since lepton candidates arising from background sources, such as decays of hadrons, are typically embedded in jets, all lepton candidates are required to be isolated from other particles in the event. This is achieved by imposing a maximal allowed value on the energy deposited in the calorimeter and/or the momentum of inner-detector tracks within a cone of R = 0.2 around the direction of the lepton candidate's momentum.

Jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and they are calibrated using energy-and \u03b7-dependent corrections. A track-based veto is used to suppress contributions from jets arising from additional pp interactions (pile-up) [46]. Jets consistent with the hadronisation of a b-quark are identified using information from track impact parameters and secondary vertices, which are combined in a multivariate discriminant [47]. The efficiency to identify b-quark jets (b-tagging) is approximately 77% for a factor of 126 in rejection against light-quark and gluon jets, about 5 against jets originating from c-quarks, and about 10 against hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons, as determined in a simulated sample of top-quark pair (tt) events [47][48][49]. Jets tagged by this multivariate discriminant, independently of the flavour of the quark that initiated it, are called b-tagged jets throughout the text, while the term b-jet is reserved for those jets originating from b-quark decays, as determined from simulation.",

Signal samples of associated Higgs boson production with a W boson, pp \u2192 W H, are generated with Powheg-Box v2-r3033 [52][53][54][55] using the CT10 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [56] at next-to-leading order (NLO). A Higgs boson mass of m H = 125 GeV is assumed and the sample is normalised to the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) cross section recommended by the Higgs cross-section working group \u03c3 SM (W H) = 1.37 pb [57]. The Higgs boson decay to two spin-zero a-bosons and the subsequent decay of each a-boson to a pair of b-quarks are simulated with Pythia v8.186 [58]. The a-boson decay is done in the narrow-width approximation and the coupling to the b-quarks is assumed to be that of a pseudoscalar. However, since the polarisation of the quarks is not observable, this search is insensitive to the specific parity hypothesis. Pythia v8.186 is used for the showering, hadronisation, and underlying-event (UE) simulation with the A14 set of tuned parameters (tune) [59]. The mass of the a-boson is varied for different signal hypotheses in the range 20 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 60 GeV, in 10 GeV mass steps. Different branching-ratio hypotheses are obtained by scaling the signal sample normalisation.",

The Powheg-Box model parameter h damp , which controls matrix element to parton shower (PS) matching and effectively regulates the highp T radiation, is set to h damp = m t . This setting was found to best describe the tt-system p T at \u221a s = 7TeV [60]. The baseline tt sample is interfaced to Pythia v6.428 [61] with the Perugia 2012 tune [62]. Alternative tt samples are generated using Powheg-Box v2-r3026 interfaced to Herwig++ v2.7 [63] or MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [64] interfaced to Herwig++. The effects of initial-and finalstate radiation (ISR/FSR) are explored using two alternative Powheg-Box v2-r3026+Pythia v6.428 samples. The first has h damp set to 2m t , the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to half the nominal value and uses the Perugia 2012 radHi UE tune, giving more radiation. The second sample uses the Perugia 2012 radLo UE tune, has h damp = m t and has the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to twice the nominal value, giving less radiation [65]. The tt samples are normalised to the NNLO theoretical cross section of 832 +46 \u221251 pb, obtained with Top++ v2.0 [66][67][68][69][70][71][72].",

The estimate uses a sample enriched in multijet background events obtained by applying the full event selection except for loosening the lepton isolation requirement. Each event with a lepton candidate that satisfies at least the loosened isolation requirement is scaled by a weight that depends on whether this lepton candidate also satisfies the tighter isolation requirement. The weights are determined from the efficiencies for fake/non-prompt and prompt leptons satisfying the loosened isolation requirement to also satisfy the tighter one [90]. These efficiencies are measured in data control samples enriched in either fake/non-prompt leptons, mostly multijet events, or prompt leptons, mostly Z \u2192 + \u2212 events. The shape of each multijet background distribution is derived by applying the same method to the sample obtained with an identical selection as described in Sect. 5, but lowering the b-tagged-jet multiplicity requirement to two. This strategy reduces the statistical uncertainty of the multijet background estimate, improving the stability of the fitting method described in Sect. 5.2.",

Another variable used is the average angular separation between all pairs of b-tagged jets, referred to as R bb av . For background tt events, the b-tagged jets originate from the decays of the two top quarks and tend to be spatially more separated than for the signal. A related variable is the minimum R separation between any b-tagged jet and the lepton, R b min . In tt background events, the lepton is typically closer to a b-tagged jet than in signal events, since the lepton and the nearest b-tagged jet often originate from the same top-quark decay.

The first variable is used in the (4j, 3b) channel to distinguish between tt events with two b-tagged jets from the top-quark decays and tt events with a third b-tagged jet from a mis-identified charm or light jet from the hadronically decaying W boson. The invariant mass of two b-tagged jets, selected as the pair with the smallest R separation, and the non-b-tagged jet, m bbj , reconstructs the hadronically decaying top quark, peaking around the top-quark mass for these background events. The second variable, used in the (4j, 4b) channel, is a variant of the m T2 observable, defined as the minimum \"mother\" particle mass compatible with all the transverse momenta and mass-shell constraints [93], that identifies events with several invisible particles. In the case of the tt background events, in addition to the E miss T from the neutrino from a leptonic W boson decay, invisible particles may arise from a \u03c4 -lepton decay or from a lost jet from a W boson. In these cases, the m T2 has an endpoint at the top-quark mass, which is not the case for the signal. Table 1 indicates which variables are used to train each of the three BDT discriminants for the (3j, 3b), (4j, 3b), and (4j, 4b) categories. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the expected distributions of the kinematical variables obtained after using the statistical procedure and the systematic uncertainties described in Sects. 5.2 and 6, respectively. These variables are used in the BDT discriminants for signal and background for all events that satisfy the event selection criteria, and are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 inclusively in number of jets and b-tagged jets. The distributions are dominated by events with the minimum number of b-tagged jets. In this comparison, the jets in each event are ordered by value of the b-tagging discrim-  inant and those with the highest score are used to calculate the input variables of the BDT, even if they do not satisfy the b-tagging criteria used in this analysis. The distributions are similar to those obtained in each analysis channel and indicate that each variable individually has some signal and background discrimination power. The tail in the m bbbb distribution for signal events, shown in Fig. 1, is mainly formed by events with jets mis-associated to the a-boson decay. The tail is greatly reduced in the signal regions with the tighter requirement on the number of b-tagged jets. Figure 4 shows the BDT discriminant for signal and background events that satisfy the event selection criteria inclusively in number of jets and b-tagged jets. These distributions are used to validate the BDT modelling in background-enriched samples with kinematic properties that are similar to those in the signal regions.",

The combined effect of all these uncertainties results in an overall normalisation uncertainty in the signal and background of less than 1%. Uncertainties associated with jets arise from the efficiency of jet reconstruction and identification, as well as the jet energy scale and resolution. The largest contribution comes from the jet energy scale uncertainty, which depends on jet p T and \u03b7. It affects the normalisation of signal and backgrounds by approximately 5% in the most sensitive search channels. Uncertainties associated with energy scales and resolutions of leptons and jets are propagated to E miss T . An uncertainty in the contribution from charged-particle tracks is also included in the E miss T uncertainty [51]. Additional uncertainties originating from the modelling of the underlying event are negligibly small.",

The search focuses on the process pp \u2192 W H where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W boson. The analysis uses the pp collision dataset at \u221a s = 13TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015, cor-responding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 \u00b1 0.2fb \u22121 . The search for H \u2192 2a \u2192 4b is performed in the mass range 20 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 60 GeV. The analysis uses several kinematic variables combined in a multivariate discriminant in signal regions and uses control regions to reduce the uncertainties in the backgrounds. No significant excess of data is observed relative to the SM predictions. Upper limits are derived for the product of the production cross section for pp \u2192 W H times the branching ratio for the decay H \u2192 2a \u2192 4b. The upper limit ranges from 6.2 pb for an a-boson mass m a = 20 GeV to 1.5 pb for m a = 60 GeV. and FAPESP, Brazil; NSERC, NRC and CFI, Canada; CERN; CONI-CYT, Chile; CAS, MOST and NSFC, China; COLCIENCIAS, Colombia; MSMT CR, MPO CR and VSC CR, Czech Republic; DNRF and DNSRC, Denmark; IN2P3-CNRS, CEA-DSM/IRFU, France; GNSF, Georgia; BMBF, HGF, and MPG, Germany; GSRT, Greece; RGC, Hong Kong SAR, China; ISF, I-CORE and Benoziyo Center, Israel; INFN, Italy; MEXT and JSPS, Japan; CNRST, Morocco; FOM and NWO, Netherlands; RCN, Norway; MNiSW and NCN, Poland; FCT, Portugal; MNE/IFA, Romania; MES of Russia and NRC KI, Russian Federation; JINR; MESTD, Serbia; MSSR, Slovakia; ARRS and MIZ\u0160, Slovenia; DST/NRF, South Africa; MINECO, Spain; SRC and Wallenberg Foundation, Sweden; SERI, SNSF and Cantons of Bern and Geneva, Switzerland; MOST, Taiwan; TAEK, Turkey; STFC, United Kingdom; DOE and NSF, United States of America.
