In addition, these measurements allow accurate tests of the theoretical calculations in the SM Higgs sector, which offer up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative Quantum ChromoDynamics (pQCD), up to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy in the resummation of soft-gluon effects at small p T , and up to next-toleading-order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative electroweak corrections [28][29][30].",

In this paper we report a measurement of JHEP03(2017)032 the fiducial cross section times branching fraction (\u03c3 \u00d7 B) and p T spectrum for Higgs boson production in H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 \u03bd\u03bd decays, based on \u221a s = 8 TeV LHC data. The analysis is performed looking at different flavour leptons in the final state in order to suppress the sizeable contribution of backgrounds containing a same-flavour lepton pair originating from Z boson decay. Although the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 2 2\u03bd channel has lower resolution in the p H T measurement compared to the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 channels because of neutrinos in the final state, the channel has a significantly larger \u03c3 B, exceeding those for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 by a factor of 10 and H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 by a factor of 85 for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV [37], and is characterized by good signal sensitivity. Such sensitivity allowed the observation of a Higgs boson at the level of 4.3 (5.8 expected) standard deviations for a mass hypothesis of 125.6 GeV using the full LHC data set at 7 and 8 TeV [7].",

HRes is a partonic level MC generator that computes the SM Higgs boson cross section at NNLO accuracy in pQCD and performs the NNLL resummation of soft-gluon effects at small p T . The central predictions of HRes are obtained including the exact top and bottom quark mass contribution to the gluon fusion loop, fixing the renormalization and factorization scale central values at a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The cross section normalization is scaled, to take into account electroweak corrections, by a factor of 1.05 and the effects of threshold resummation by a factor of 1.06 [69,70]. The upper and lower bounds of the uncertainties are obtained by scaling up and down both the renormalization and the factorization scales by a factor of two. The powheg V2 generator is a matrix element based generator that provides a NLO description of the ggH process in association with zero jets, taking into account the finite mass of the bottom and top quarks. The powheg prediction is tuned using the powheg damping factor hdump of 104.17 GeV, in order to match the p H T spectrum predicted by HRes in the full phase space. This factor reduces the emission of additional jets in the high p T regime, and enhances the -4 -JHEP03 (2017)032contribution from the Sudakov form factor in the limit of low p T . The powheg generator is interfaced to the JHUGen generator version 5.2.5 [71][72][73] for the decay of the Higgs boson to a W boson pair and interfaced with pythia 8 [74] for the simulation of parton shower and hadronization effects.",

This modification significantly reduces the uncertainties related to the modelling of the number of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson because the number of jets is strongly correlated with p H T . Events are selected requiring the presence of two isolated leptons with opposite charge, an electron and a muon, with p T > 20(10) GeV for the leading (subleading) lepton, and with |\u03b7| < 2.5 for electrons and |\u03b7| < 2.4 for muons. No additional electron or muon with p T > 10 GeV is allowed. The two leptons are required to originate from a single primary vertex. Among the vertices identified in the event, the vertex with the largest p 2 T , where the sum runs over all tracks associated with that vertex, is chosen as the primary vertex. The invariant mass of the two leptons, m , is required to be greater than 12 GeV. A projected E miss T variable is defined as the component of p miss T transverse to the nearest lepton if the lepton is situated within the azimuthal angular window of \u00b1\u03c0/2 from the p miss T direction, or the E miss T itself otherwise [7]. Since the E miss T resolution is degraded by pileup, the minimum of two projected E miss T variables is used: one constructed from all identified particles (full projected E miss T ), and another constructed from the charged particles only (track projected E miss T ). Events must have both E miss T and the minimum projected E miss T above 20 GeV. In order to suppress Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events, the vector p T sum of the two leptons, p T , is required to be greater than 30 GeV and a minimum transverse mass of the lepton plus E miss T vector of 60 GeV is required.

Fiducial phase space requirements are chosen in order to minimize the dependence of the measurements on the underlying model of the Higgs boson properties and its production mechanism.

The leptons are defined as Born-level leptons, i.e. before the emission of final-state radiation (FSR), and are required not to originate from leptonic \u03c4 decays. The effect of including FSR is evaluated to be of the order of 5% in each p H T bin. For the VH signal process the two leptons are required to originate from the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 2 2\u03bd decays in order to avoid including leptons coming from the associated W or Z boson.",

The effect of the limited E miss T resolution has two main implications for the analysis strategy. The first one is that the choice of the -6 -JHEP03 (2017)032binning in the p H T spectrum needs to take into account the detector resolution. The binning in p H T is built in such a way as to ensure that at least 60% of the signal events generated in a given p H T bin are also reconstructed in that bin. This procedure yields the following bin boundaries: [0,15], [15,45], [45,85], [85,125], [125,165], and [165, \u221e] GeV. The second implication is that migrations of events across bins are significant.",

For the estimation of the top quark background in the first category, the same estimate from control samples in data as in ref. [7] is used. The contribution of the background in the second category is estimated independently in each p H T bin, by normalizing it in a control region defined by requiring at least one jet with a JBP b tagging discriminator value above a given threshold, chosen to have a pure control region enriched in b jets.

The shapes of these backgrounds are corrected for different b tagging efficiency in data and MC simulation, and the normalization is taken from data in a top quark enriched control region independently in each p H T bin, as explained in section 5. The uncertainties related to this procedure arise from the sample size in the control regions for each p H T bin, and are embedded in the scale factors used to extrapolate the top quark background normalization from the control region to the signal region. They vary from 20% to 50% depending on the p H T bin. This analysis takes into account the theoretical uncertainties that affect the normalization and shape of all backgrounds and the signal distribution shape. These uncertainties arise from missing higher-order corrections in pQCD and PDF uncertainties, and are predicted using MC simulations.

In order to evaluate their effect on the signal strengths parameters, two additional fits are performed, each time fixing the nuisance parameter value to \u00b11 standard deviation with respect to its nominal value. The results of the fits are then compared to the results of the full fit obtained by floating all the nuisance parameters, thus determining the relative uncertainty on the signal strengths due to each nuisance parameter. Using these uncertainties, the measured spectra for each type B source are built. The effects are propagated through the unfolding by building the corresponding variations of the response matrix and unfolding the measured spectra with the appropriate matrix. Type C uncertainties are related to the underlying assumption on the Higgs boson production mechanism used to extract the fiducial cross sections. These are evaluated using an alternative shape for the true distribution at generator level. Since the reconstructed spectrum observed in data is consistent with a spectrum that falls to zero in the last three bins of the distribution, a true spectrum in accordance with this assumption is used -  Table 5.
