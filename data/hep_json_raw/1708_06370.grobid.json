The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet.  [19,20]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, in which all charged particles with p T > 500 (300) MeV are reconstructed for 2011 (2012) data, and p T > 70 MeV for 2015 and 2016 data. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to contain a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold varied between 3 and 4 GeV between 2011 and 2016. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with significant displacement from all primary pp interaction vertices. A multivariate algorithm [21,22] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

The second category Bkg rate corresponds to the use of fixed background yields in the fit. For example, the rate of B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + decays is fixed in the fit using known branching fractions as external inputs. This category also accounts for charmless background contributions, each of which have fixed rates in the fit. The Bkg func and Sig func categories refer to the use of fixed shape parameters in background and signal functions, respectively; each of these parameters is determined using simulated samples. The category Sim accounts for the use of fixed selection efficiencies derived from simulation, for instance the relative efficiency of selecting B \u2212 \u2192 (D\u03c0 0 ) D * \u03c0 \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays. The final category, Asym, refers to the use of fixed asymmetries in the fit. This category accounts for the use of fixed CP asymmetries and detection asymmetries in the fit, as described earlier.  The results obtained using fully reconstructed B \u2212 \u2192 Dh \u2212 decays supersede those in Ref. [12], while the B \u2212 \u2192 D * h \u2212 results are reported for the first time. The statistical and systematic correlation matrices are given in the appendix. There is a high degree of anticorrelation between partially reconstructed signal and background components in the fit, which all compete for yield in the same invariant mass region. The anticorrelation between the Table 6 of the appendix. The presence of such anticorrelations is a natural consequence of the method of partial reconstruction, and limits the precision with which the CP observables can be measured using this approach.",

The relatively large value of r D K B \u2248 0.10 [3] in B \u2212 \u2192 D K \u2212 decays allows the determination of the relative phase of the two interfering amplitudes. This relative phase has both CP -violating (\u03b3 ) and CP -conserving (\u03b4 D K B ) contributions; a measurement of the decay rates for both B + and B \u2212 gives sensitivity to \u03b3 . Similar interference effects also occur in B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays, albeit with lower sensitivity to the phases. The reduced sensitivity is the result of additional Cabibbo suppression factors, which decrease the ratio of amplitudes relative to B \u2212 \u2192 D K \u2212 decays by around a factor of 20. The B \u2212 \u2192 D * K \u2212 decay, in which the vector D * meson 2 decays to either the D\u03c0 0 or D\u03b3 final state, also exhibits CP -violating effects when hadronic D decays accessible to both D 0 and D 0 mesons are studied. In this decay, the exact strong phase difference of \u03c0 between D * \u2192 D\u03c0 0 and D * \u2192 D\u03b3 decays can be exploited to measure CP observables for states with opposite CP eigenvalues [7]. The degree of CP violation observed in B \u2212 \u2192 D * K \u2212 decays is set by the magnitude of the ratio r D * K B \u2248 0.12 [3], and 2 D * represents an admixture of the D * (2007) 0 and D * (2007) 0 states. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2017.11.070 0370-2693/\u00a9 2017 The Author.

Therefore, while separate results are presented for the B \u2212 \u2192 Dh \u2212 modes to allow comparison with previous measurements, the combined result is most relevant for the determination of \u03b3 .
