We observe no significant event excess with respect to the standard model prediction and extract a 95% C.L. upper limit on the cross section times acceptance for a potential contribution from a nonstandard model process. The search is made by using novel, data-driven techniques for estimating backgrounds that are applicable to first searches at the LHC.

In general, any model predicting pair production of unstable particles whose decay products are a single parton and a noninteracting particle could be observable as an event excess above the SM expectation in the dijet \u00fe E T channel. In this Letter, we report on a signature-based search for new physics contributions to the dijet \u00fe E T final state in CDF run II data collected in p p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u00c01 . This search features newly developed techniques for obtaining datadriven predictions of SM background contributions to the search samples. These techniques evade large systematic uncertainties inherent in Monte Carlo-based background estimates such as those affiliated with the modeling of jet energy scale and resolution.",

Here the criteria are chosen to encompass the widest possible kinematic range consistent with the trigger used to collect the data sample. We perform a simple counting experiment on this inclusive sample, comparing the number of observed events against the SM expectation, to search for indications of potential non-SM contributions. A second, analogous counting experiment is made on a subsample of the highest energy events from within the inclusive sample, which is more sensitive to some classes of non-SM production processes. The tighter kinematic selections that define this event subset are chosen to give a fixed (15%) uncertainty on the data-driven SM background prediction made for this sample. From here forward, we refer to these sets of candidate events as our loose and tight samples. Based on the counting experiment results, we place 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section times acceptance ( \u00c2 A) for a generic, non-SM process that contributes events to the candidate samples. Finally, we use the generic limit on \u00c2 A to extract a lower limit on leptoquark mass for the specific case of scalar leptoquark production, which serves as a sensitivity benchmark for the result.",

The data sample was collected by using a three-level trigger system based on a minimum E T requirement of 45 GeV. Reconstructed candidate events are required to have E T > 80 GeV to ensure full trigger efficiency. Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeter by using a cone-based algorithm with fixed radius of 0.7 in \u00c0 space. The measured jet E T is corrected for detector effects and contributions from multiple p p interactions per bunch crossing [8]. Events in the candidate samples are required to have two reconstructed jets with jj < 2:4 and E T > 30 GeV and no additional jets with jj < 3:6 and E T > 15 GeV. In addition, the scalar sum of the two jet transverse energies, H T \u00bc E T \u00f0jet 1\u00de \u00fe E T \u00f0jet 2\u00de, must be greater than 125 GeV. A separation of at least 0.5 radians in azimuthal angle is required between the E T and both jets to help suppress multijet background events containing significant E T from poorly measured jets. Events from beam-related backgrounds and cosmic rays are removed by using standard criteria [9] to tag reconstructed tracks and jets inconsistent with having been produced by particles originating from p p collisions. The subset of events that satisfy tighter kinematic thresholds of E T > 100 GeV and H T > 225 GeV define the tight candidate sample.",

The largest SM background is Z \u00fe jets where the Z boson decays into a pair of neutrinos. This process results in a signature indistinguishable from that of potential signal, and its relative contribution to the candidate samples is therefore irreducible. The next most significant SM contribution is from W \u00fe jets in which the W decays via a charged lepton (e, , or ) and neutrino. We suppress this background by rejecting events that contain either an isolated track [9] with p T > 10 GeV=c ( or candidate) or a jet with E T > 15 GeV and electromagnetic energy fraction above 90% (e candidate).",

Acceptances depend on the specific lepton (' \u00bc e or ) decay channel and the associated loose or tight dijet \u00fe E T selection criteria. To account for observed differences in lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies between data and simulation, corrections of up to 10% per lepton are applied to the simulated acceptances.

An upper limit on the number of non-SM signal events contained within each sample is obtained by using a Bayesian approach with a flat prior for the number of signal events and priors based on gamma distributions for both the acceptance and number of SM background events [17]. These limits are directly translatable into upper limits on \u00c2 A for any new physics process that contributes events to our candidate samples. The limits do not assume central values for signal acceptance, which is detectordependent and varies significantly for different processes. Quoted limits are based on specific choices for acceptance uncertainties, which vary less among the different processes. For a 15% signal acceptance uncertainty we obtain a 95% C.L. upper limit of 0.18 pb (0.02 pb) on \u00c2 A for the loose (tight) candidate sample. Increasing the signal acceptance uncertainty by a factor of 2 leads to a 25% degradation in the quoted limits.",

            "text": "For the case of scalar leptoquark pair production where each leptoquark decays into a quark and a neutrino, we provide an example of the detector-dependent acceptance calculation required to extract model limits. We simulate signal acceptance by using PYTHIA in conjunction with a full detector simulation. The loose (tight) dijet \u00fe E T selection criteria yield an acceptance of 14% (4%) to a firstgeneration leptoquark with a mass of 150 GeV=c 2 . Acceptance increases as a function of leptoquark mass (M LQ ), rising to 20% (9%) at 200 GeV=c 2 . The relative acceptance uncertainty is 13% (20%) independent of M LQ and comes from potential variations in parton distribution functions (PDFs), ambiguity in the absolute jet energy scale [8], modeling of initial and final state radiation, data sample luminosity, and selection efficiencies. Mass limits are based on a NLO production cross section calculation [18] by using the CTEQ6.1M PDF set [19] and \u00bc M LQ for the renormalization and factorization scales. Cross section uncertainties due to PDF modeling (from the full set of CTEQ6.1M eigenvectors) and scale choice (from varying between M LQ =2 and 2 \u00c2 M LQ ) are added in quadrature. We determine the sample with best a priori sensitivity to the leptoquark model at each mass point and set a 95% C.L. lower mass limit based on where the cross section limit from the more sensitive sample intersects the lower uncertainty band of the NLO calculation. Figure 2 shows the cross section limits as a function of leptoquark mass, which result in lower mass limits of 187 GeV=c 2 for first-and second-generation q scalar leptoquarks (corresponding to an upper cross section limit of 0.33 pb at this mass point). This result significantly improves upon the previous CDF limit [5] and is only slightly looser than the D0 lower mass limit of 205 GeV=c 2 [6] obtained from an optimized search on a 25% larger data sample.",
