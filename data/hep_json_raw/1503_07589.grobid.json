The results are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the reconstructed invariant mass peaks in the two channels and for the two experiments. The measured masses from the individual channels and the two experiments are found to be consistent among themselves. The combined measured mass of the Higgs boson is m H \u00bc 125.09 AE 0.21 \u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.11 \u00f0syst\u00de GeV.",

            "text": "The study of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the principal goals of the CERN LHC program. In the standard model (SM), this symmetry breaking is achieved through the introduction of a complex doublet scalar field, leading to the prediction of the Higgs boson H [1][2][3][4][5][6], whose mass m H is, however, not predicted by the theory. In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC announced the discovery of a particle with Higgs-boson-like properties and a mass of about 125 GeV [7][8][9]. The discovery was based primarily on mass peaks observed in the \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 l 0\u00fe l 0\u2212 (denoted H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l for simplicity) decay channels, where one or both of the Z bosons can be off shell and where l and l 0 denote an electron or muon. With m H known, all properties of the SM Higgs boson, such as its production cross section and partial decay widths, can be predicted. Increasingly precise measurements [10][11][12][13] have established that all observed properties of the new particle, including its spin, parity, and coupling strengths to SM particles are consistent within the uncertainties with those expected for the SM Higgs boson. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have independently measured m H using the samples of proton-proton collision data collected in 2011 and 2012, commonly referred to as LHC Run 1. The analyzed samples correspond to approximately 5 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV, and 20 fb \u22121 at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, for each experiment. Combined results in the context of the separate experiments, as well as those in the individual channels, are presented in Refs. [12,[14][15][16].",

Besides its intrinsic importance as a fundamental parameter, improved knowledge of m H yields more precise predictions for the other Higgs boson properties. Furthermore, the combined mass measurement provides a first step towards combinations of other quantities, such as the couplings. In the SM, m H is related to the values of the masses of the W boson and top quark through loopinduced effects. Taking into account other measured SM quantities, the comparison of the measurements of the Higgs boson, W boson, and top quark masses can be used to directly test the consistency of the SM [17] and thus to search for evidence of physics beyond the SM.",

The\u03b1 and\u03b8 terms denote the unconditional maximum likelihood estimates of the best-fit values for the parameters, whil\u00ea \u03b8\u00f0\u03b1\u00de is the conditional maximum likelihood estimate for given parameter values \u03b1. The likelihood functions L are constructed using signal and background probability density functions (PDFs) that depend on the discriminating variables: for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel, the diphoton mass, and, for the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l channel, the four-lepton mass (for CMS, also its uncertainty) and the kinematic discriminant. The signal PDFs are derived from samples of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events. For the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l channel, the background PDFs are determined using a combination of simulation and data control regions. For the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel, the background PDFs are obtained directly from the fit to the data. The profile-likelihood fits to the data are performed as a function of m H and the signal-strength scale factors defined below. The fitting framework is implemented independently by ATLAS and CMS, using the ROOFIT [27], ROOSTATS [28], and HISTFACTORY [29] data modeling and handling packages.",

The latter are evaluated by generating two Asimov data sets [26], where an Asimov data set is a representative event sample that provides both the median expectation for an experimental result and its expected statistical variation, in the asymptotic approximation, without the need for an extensive MC-based calculation. The first Asimov data set is a \"prefit\" sample, generated using m H \u00bc 125.0 GeV and the SM predictions for the couplings, with all nuisance parameters fixed to their nominal values. The second Asimov data set is a \"postfit\" sample, in which m H , the three signal strengths \u03bc \u03b3\u03b3 ggF\u00fettH , \u03bc \u03b3\u03b3 VBF\u00feVH , and \u03bc 4l , and all nuisance parameters are fixed to their best-fit estimates from the data. The expected uncertainties for the combined mass are \u03b4m H prefit \u00bc AE0.   for the postfit case, which are both very similar to the observed uncertainties reported in Eq. 3. Constraining all signal yields to their SM predictions results in an m H value that is about 70 MeV larger than the nominal result with a comparable uncertainty. The increase in the central value reflects the combined effect of the higher-than-expected H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l measured signal strength and the increase of the H \u2192 ZZ branching fraction with m H .

Nevertheless, the relative impact of the different effects can be explored. A few experiment-specific groups of nuisance parameters are defined. For example, ATLAS includes a group of nuisance parameters to account for the inaccuracy of the background modeling for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel. To model this background, ATLAS uses specific analytic functions in each category [14] while CMS simultaneously considers different background parametrizations [35].
