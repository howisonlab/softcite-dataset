This paper describes an experimental test of the predictions of this theoretical work by searching for events with two photons from positron annihilation of energy larger than the electron rest mass (511 keV). The positrons came from a 22 Na source, tagging the third photon from the spontaneous emission of 22 Ne * de-exitation to suppress backgrounds. Using the collected sample of 1.06 \u00d7 10 7 positronelectron annihilations, triple coincidence photon events in the signal-enhanced energy regions are examined. The observed number of events in two signal regions, N SR1 obs = 0 and N SR2 obs = 0, are, within the current precision, consistent with the expected number of events, N SR1 exp = 0.86 \u00b1 0.08(stat.) +1.85  \u22120.81 (syst.)  and N SR2 exp = 0.37 \u00b1 0.05(stat.) +0.80 \u22120.29 (syst.) from Fermi's golden rule, respectively. Based on the P (d)  modeling, a 90% CL lower limit on the photon wave packet size is obtained.",

            "text": "In a previous publication [1] it was shown that deviations from quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations by Fermi's golden rule may appear in positron annihilation. Such deviations arise from the approximations made in the calculations. Explicit formulae for the expected deviations are derived fully in Ref. [1]. In this paper an attempt to detect experimentally such deviations is described. The process of positron annihilation to two photons is a simple system and their detection is suitable for a precision test of QED. A transition probability of the quantum process, P(T ), at time T is formulated by Fermi's golden rule with a certain approximation [2,3], i.e., P(T ) = T , where is the average transition rate. A problem of this approximation has been pointed out by several theoretical considerations, and it is suggested that an additive constant correction term, P (d) , is required in the formulation as in Eq. (1) [4]: P(T ) = T + P (d) .",

Although the processes based on the correction term, P (d) , can show a unique signature of its non-conserving nature of the kinetic energies, experimental confirmation of the effect has not been hitherto seriously pursued mainly due to its predicted broad spectrum, which would lie under the backgrounds, preventing its manifestation. In Ref. [1] it is proposed that the two-photon process of the position annihilation could manifest a sizable correction, and the feasibility of an experiment using a simple setup is discussed.A setup based on the 22 Na radioactive source surrounded by \u03b3 -ray detectors, e.g., NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors, is an ideal platform for verifying such effects. From the process, 22 Na \u2192 22 Ne * +e + +\u03bd, e + +(e \u2212 ) \u2192 \u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 , two photons with the same energies in opposite directions are expected. Here, (e \u2212 ) are the electrons resident within the materials near the source. In Fermi's golden rule, the energies of the two photons are the electron rest mass, i.e., E \u03b3 1 = E \u03b3 2 = 511 keV, while, with the correction term, P (d) , it can deviate from 511 keV as illustrated in Fig. 1.",

Section 4 describes the data analysis. Section 5 summarizes the results, and the results are interpreted in Sect. 6. Section 7 concludes this new measurement. Figure 2 is the top view of the experimental setup. The 22 Na radioactive source (Japan Isotope Center, 3 mm diameter aperture, 25 kBq) [6] is placed at the center, which is surrounded by six cylindrical NaI(Tl) scintillators (see later text for details), PMT1-6. As in the figure, three pairs are put in a back-to-back configuration with respect to the source, with 45 \u2022 separation between them. The scintillators face the center of the setup, and the distance between their surface and the center is 80 mm. In the center is placed a 22 Na radioactive source with the positron tagging system as shown in Fig. 3. A thin plastic scintillator plate (Saint-Gobain, \u03c6 7.5 mm \u00d7 t 0.1 mm, BC-408, polyvinyltoluene 1.023 g/cc [7]) is placed beneath the 22 Na source, then comes the small container filled with the SiO 2 powder (Nippon Aerosil, R812 (density: \u223c 60 mg/cm 3 , specific surface area: 230-290 m 2 /g) [8]). Positrons ejected from the source scintillate in the thin plate scintillator. The  scintillation light propagates through the thin light guides on both sides (CI Industry Co. Ltd [9], t 2 mm \u00d7 30 mm \u00d7 39 mm) and the second light guides (\u03c6 38 mm \u00d7 t 109.7 mm) and is then read out by two photomultipliers (Hamamatsu H6410). These PMTs are called PMTs 7 and 8, and the coincidences of these are considered as the positron signals and used as triggers. Positrons are trapped inside aerogel pores of the silica powder and annihilate into two photons. It is assumed that the positron is captured from rest [10][11][12]. This gives the magnitude of the background from in-flight annihilation as less than 10 \u22126 as estimated in Ref. [1]. In order to reduce the contribution from positronium formation, the silica powder container is filled with air. This positron signal timing is used to suppress the accidental background by requiring two detections, one from the combination of the \u03b3 -ray detections and one from the positron signals. Additionally, the requirement of a positron signal in the plastic scintillator can constrain the positron annihilation position to be inside the SiO 2 powder case.",

The analogue signals were handled with the NIM standard modules, for the digitization, timing adjustment, and coincidence taking. As the energy deposit of positrons on the thin plastic scintillator is small, the outputs of PMTs 7 and 8 are amplified with FastAmp (Kaizuworks Corporation, 2104 [16]). They are digitized with low threshold, and timing coincidence of PMTs 7 and 8 is required to mitigate the fake signals from the noise. One output from each of PMTs 1-6 is fed into the discriminator module, and the signal timings are defined by the digitized outputs of them. A hardware coincidence of the positron signal and at least one hit out of six PMTs for the photons (PMTs 1-6), is used as a trigger for the data taking. The time difference, \u03b4t i , between the positron signal and each photon detector (i = 1-6) is measured with a time-to-digital converter (TDC, Technoland Corporation, C-TS103, 125 ps resolution [17]). Other outputs from each of PMTs 1-6 (each PMT has two anode outputs) are used to measure the energy depositions inside NaI(Tl). In order to measure the energy deposition, these outputs are subdivided into two lines, and are fed to a charge sensitive analogue-to-digital converter (ADC, Hoshin Electronics Co., Ltd, C009 [18]) with different gate widths to mitigate the pile-up events. Hereafter they are called ADC wide (gate width 1.2 \u03bcs) and ADC narrow (gate width 100 ns).",

The accidental coincidence rate, R acc , is expected to be in the form R acc = R e + \u00d7 R \u03b3 h e + + h \u03b3 \u2212 2h coin , where R e + is the positron detection rate (\u223c 100 Hz), R \u03b3 is the environmental radiation detection rate (\u223c 0.17 Hz), h e + is the pulse width of the positron signal (\u223c 100 ns), h \u03b3 is the pulse width of the photon signal (\u223c 100 ns), and h coin is the minimum time width required for the coincidence (\u223c 10 ns).

Figure 4(a) represents the nominal event case where 511 keV photons from annihilations are detected in opposite side detectors.

The energy  deposit in the additional detector, E 3 , should be 1200 keV \u2264 E 3 \u2264 1390 keV.

In these coincidence events, energy depositions in the opposite direction pair are called E 1 and E 2 , where E 1 is measured with one of PMTs 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, E 2 is the one from PMTs 4, 5, and 6. In the 2D phase space of E 1 and E 2 , three control regions (CRs) are defined. These CRs abound with background in 2-coincidence events, and they are used to normalize the distributions from simulation to the measured data. Also defined are two signal regions (SRs), where a large signal-to-background ratio is expected, and two validation regions (VRs), which are used to check the validity of the background estimation in the region close to the SRs. They are defined in Table 1. The definition of these regions can be graphically confirmed in Fig. 5. CR1 is dominated by those events in which both 511 keV photons are photoelectrically absorbed (Fig. 4(a)).

Using these experimentally obtained numbers, the accidental background rate and the pileup event rate are evaluated as follows. The accidental backgrounds originate from the double-hit events and appear in CR3 where two 1275 keV photons are accidentally detected in opposite side detectors in the time window of this experiment. The accidental background event rate, i.e., the ratio of double-hit events to single-hit events, called \u03b1, is determined from the equation N data CR3 /N data CR1 = (N simul CR3,single +\u03b1N simul CR3,double )/(N simul CR1,single +\u03b1N simul CR1,double ). \u03b1 is estimated to be \u03b1 = (3.35 +4.43 \u22122.16 )\u00d710 \u22124 . The estimated numbers of events in CR1, CR2, and CR3 after taking \u03b1 into account are N estim CR1,\u03b1 = 1.52 \u00d7 10 6 , N estim CR2,\u03b1 = 1.17, and N estim CR3,\u03b1 = 1.01, respectively. Since the rejection power for pileup backgrounds after the timing coincidence is weaker than for accidental background, more pileup events are expected in CR2 and in the associated lower-energy range. In order to estimate this amount, another type of simulation sample, called a semi-double event, containing two pairs of 511 keV photons and one 1275 keV photon per event, is generated, aiming to simulate the pileup events that appear in CR2 and not in CR3. The remaining number of events in CR1 and CR2 out of the 2 \u00d7 10 8 semi-double events generated, N simul CR1,semi , N simul CR2,semi , are found to be N simul CR1,semi = 2.92 \u00d7 10 6 , N simul CR2,semi = 2.85 \u00d7 10 3 .
