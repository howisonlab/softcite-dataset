In particular, being the strange quark mass at the level of \u039b QCD it probes the non perturbative QCD regime. Moreover, as the valence quarks in the proton are up and down only, the study of strangeness production provides a good environment to assess and tune phenomenological models of hadronisation, thereby improving Monte Carlo generators at LHC energies.",

Due to the non standard position of the VELO and long K 0 S lifetime, only a fraction of the decays could leave a signal in the VELO. Therefore, two parallel analyses were carried out. The first was based on tracks that left hits in the entire tracking system (VELO, TT and T1-T3), called long tracks, while the second was based on downstream tracks, which do not require any information from the VELO. The invariant mass distribution for K 0 S candidates after selection is shown in Fig. 1 for the long tracks analysis. K 0 S production yields have been measured in bins of rapidity (y) and transverse momentum (p T ). For each bin the signal estimation has been made by means of a \u03c7 2 fit using a linear function to parametrise the background and a double gaussian with common mean to represent the signal. In order to estimate the reconstruction and selection efficiency Monte Carlo (MC) simulated pp collisions have been generated with the PYTHIA 6.4 [4] package and propagated through the detector with full simulation with the GEANT 4 package [5]. The trigger efficiency has been estimated from the MC simulations, and crosschecked directly from data, exploiting events triggered independently from K 0 S daughters particles. The tracking efficiency was calculated from MC detailed detector simulations, which have been corrected in order to reproduce data hit-finding inefficiency due to residual misalignment. The selection efficiency has been estimated both in data and MC and compared using samples selected with a pre-selection looser than the final one. Finally, systematic uncertainties for non-prompt K 0 S and diffractive events modelling in MC simulations have been estimated and associated to the final results.",

No particle identification was used, therefore, in order to remove the background coming from K 0 S reflections, the K 0 S invariant mass region in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hypothesis was cut away. The \u039b invariant mass distribution after selection is shown in Fig. 4. The data samples divide approximately equally into field-up and field-down, in which the dipole field is pointing in opposite directions; the results for\u039b/\u039b ratio were found to be consistent with each other, indicating no significant charge-dependent systematics, and averaged for the final results.",

Since the final states of \u039b and\u039b are kinematically equivalent many effects cancelled out. The sum of the systematic uncertainties amounts to 2% relative plus a 0.02 absolute uncertainty.",

Data is compared to LHCb Monte Carlo and PYTHIA 6 MC generator with the so-called \"Perugia 0\" settings [1,4]. erator simulations with the so-called \"Perugia 0\" settings [1,4]. It can be seen that the measured ratio at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV is significantly below the prediction of the generators. The same results are also shown in Fig. 6, as a function of \u2206y = y beam \u2212 y \u039b , which allows the compar- ison of results from different rapidity regions and different beam energies. The LHCb data are seen to be consistent with a continuous distribution over a wide range in \u2206y. They are also consistent with a previous measurement provided by the STAR experiment. [10].",
