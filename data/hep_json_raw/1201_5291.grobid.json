The measurement has been performed using an integrated luminosity of 1.09 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector. The reconstruction of the tt candidates is performed after a cut-based event selection using a kinematic fit. A data-driven technique is used to estimate the dominant background from QCD multijet production. The cross section is determined from a fit to the top quark mass. The cross section measurement yields \u03c3(tt) = 136 \u00b1 20(stat.) \u00b1 40(sys.) \u00b1 8(lumi.) pb. This result is consistent with an independent measurement in the same channel, with the measurements in other decay channels and with the Standard Model predictions.",

For this analysis the kinematic properties of signal and background events are characterized to develop a kinematic selection based on a neural network. Moreover, the QCD multijet background is estimated from data using the information from the kinematic variables of dijet pairs that passed loose b-tagging criteria and extrapolating to the signal region with tighter b-tagging criteria and higher jet multiplicities. The neural network has been trained using in total eight kinematic variables. These variables are sphericity, centrality, aplanarity, the sum of transverse jet energies (including and without the first two jets), the transverse jet energies weighted with sin 2 \u03b8 (\u03b8 being the angle enclosed by the jet and the beam-axis in the center-of-mass frame of the multijet final state) for the first and second jets, as well as the mean of the remaining jets. The events are all required to have a jet multiplicity of 6 \u2264 N jet \u2264 8, where the jets selection criteria are the same as for the main analysis. The outcome of the training process is shown in Figure 2. The selected events are required to have a neural network output NN out > 0.65. To improve the purity of the selected sample two b-tags are required using an algorithm different from the on used in the main analysis, with an efficiency of 63 \u00b1 4% and mis-tag rate of 1.8 \u00b1 0.2%. The assumption for the datadriven QCD multijet background estimate is that the bb dynamics in events with six or more jets can be appropriately inferred from a control sample of events with four or five jets. Three variables are used to parametrize the probability that both jets in a given dijet pair are both b-tagged: the average transverse momentum < p T >, the average pseudorapidity < |\u03b7| >, and the opening angle between the two jets \u2206R.",
