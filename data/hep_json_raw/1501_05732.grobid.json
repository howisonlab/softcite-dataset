A partial-wave analysis (PWA) was performed in bins of 3\u03c0 mass and four-momentum transfer using the isobar model and the so far largest PWA model consisting of 88 waves. A narrow peak is observed in the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0 channel with spin, parity and C-parity quantum numbers J PC \u00bc 1 \u00fe\u00fe . We present a resonance-model study of a subset of the spin-density matrix selecting 3\u03c0 states with J PC \u00bc 2 \u00fe\u00fe and 4 \u00fe\u00fe decaying into \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0 and with J PC \u00bc 1 \u00fe\u00fe decaying into f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0. We identify a new a 1 meson with mass \u00f01414 \u00fe15 \u221213 \u00de MeV=c 2 and width \u00f0153 \u00fe8 \u221223 \u00de MeV=c 2 . Within the final states investigated in our analysis, we observe the new a 1 \u00f01420\u00de decaying only into f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0, suggesting its exotic nature.",

            "text": "One of the great challenges in particle physics is the understanding of how hadronic matter is constructed from its basic building blocks, quarks, and gluons. Although many possibilities are allowed, which all follow the principle of confinement, almost all hadrons observed can be described by the constituent quark model. The known light-meson spectrum is presently interpreted in terms of qq quark-model states that are associated with flavor SU(3) multiplets according to their mass and J PC quantum numbers. For some J PC combinations, more states were reported than can be accommodated by SU (3) symmetry. Depending on their coupling to specific production mechanisms and their decay pattern, these states are interpreted as either carrying a strong glueball component, e.g., f 0 \u00f01500\u00de, as molecular-type excitations, e.g., f 1 \u00f01420\u00de, or as tetra-quark states. For a detailed review see Ref. [1]. However, their exotic structure is under debate, unlike for states that carry spin-exotic quantum numbers, e.g., J PC \u00bc 1 \u2212\u00fe , and, hence, cannot be qq states. This is in contrast to the sector of heavy mesons containing c or b quarks, where exotic mesons have clearly been identified, e.g., X, Y, and Z states. In particular, the recent observation of charged Z states, such as Z c \u00f03900\u00de AE and Z b \u00f010610\u00de AE , has proven the existence of mesons with exotic structure [2][3][4]. Already the existence of one system with a wave function and/or quantum numbers requiring an explanation beyond \"ordinary\" mesons implies the existence of a large number of additional matter states. Unless new principles for the construction of color-neutral hadrons are found, this should hold for all quark-flavor combinations.",

            "text": "In the sector of light mesons, the issue of exotic states remains unresolved. The lowest-mass state discussed in this context is the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, which contains nn (n \u00bc fu; dg) and a dominant ss component. It has also been interpreted as a KK molecule [5][6][7]. The f 1 \u00f01420\u00de with a width of only 55 MeV=c 2 couples strongly to KK \u00c3 and was also suggested to be a molecular-type structure [8]. In Ref. [9], the Particle Data Group has tentatively adopted the scenario of f 1 \u00f01420\u00de being the SU(3) partner of f 1 \u00f01285\u00de. In the class of spin-exotic mesons, the \u03c0 1 \u00f01600\u00de is the only meson observed by several experiments in different decay modes. However, the masses quoted and, in particular, the widths vary considerably between different experiments, and values for the width often exceed 400 MeV=c 2 . This suggests the existence of dynamical effects similar to the case of a 1 \u00f01260\u00de. The situation is characterized by individual states without recognizable pattern and, except for a 0 \u00f0980\u00de and f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, the absence of any observed isospin partners.",

The trigger is based on a recoil-proton signal in the RPD in coincidence with an incoming beam particle and no signal in the beam-veto counters. We require a production vertex located within the target volume, with one incoming beampion track and three outgoing charged particles, compatible with the pion hypothesis based on information from the RICH counter. The sum of the momenta of the outgoing particles is required to be equal to the average beam momentum within two standard deviations, i.e., AE3.78 GeV=c. We require Feynman-x of the fastest final-state pion to be below 0.9 for rapidity differences between the fast \u03c0 \u2212 and the slower \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe pair in the range 2.7 to 4.5. This suppresses the small contamination of centrally produced final states, which contribute mainly at higher 3\u03c0 masses.

First, we fit the intensity distributions in the 5-dimensional phase space independently in 100 20 MeV=c 2 wide bins of 3\u03c0 mass m 3\u03c0 , each divided into 11 bins of t 0 . We adopt the notation J PC M \u03b5 \u00bdisobar\u03c0L to define partial waves. Here, \u03b5 denotes the reflectivity and M \u2265 0 the magnitude of the spin projection along the beam axis (see Ref. [18]), while L is the orbital angular momentum between the isobar and the bachelor pion in the decay of the 3\u03c0 state. We use the isobar model, which for our fits contains 88 waves, i.e., 80 waves with positive and 7 with negative reflectivity as well as one noninterfering wave representing three uncorrelated pions. This set contains all significant isobars that decay into \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe and has been derived from a larger set with 128 waves by requiring a minimum relative intensity of about 10 \u22124 . The likelihood fit function is built from two incoherently added terms that correspond to the two values of reflectivity, \u03b5 \u00bc AE1. Each term coherently sums over all partial-wave amplitudes that belong to the respective value of \u03b5. Details on the fit model, the fitting procedure, and the results are described in Refs. [16,17]. The division of our data set into 11 bins of t 0 is motivated by the very different t 0 dependences of resonant and nonresonant components [11,16]. In all partial waves studied, the intensity of nonresonant, i.e., Deck-like components [19], drops off much faster with increasing t 0 than that of resonances.",

Typically, only subsets of these spin-density matrices are fit simultaneously. In this Letter, we present such a fit using a minimal set of 3 waves, namely, 2 \u00fe\u00fe 1 \u00fe \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0D, 4 \u00fe\u00fe 1 \u00fe \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0G, and 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0P. The first two waves contain the known a 2 \u00f01320\u00de and a 4 \u00f02040\u00de. These two waves act as interferometers in order to search for structures in 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0P, where no resonances have yet been reported. For this fit, we model the amplitude of each wave by a coherent superposition of a resonant contribution, which is described by a relativistic Breit-Wigner (BW) amplitude and a nonresonant contribution. Hence both components are allowed to interfere. In the 4 \u00fe\u00fe and 1 \u00fe\u00fe waves, the latter are described by terms of the form F \u00f0m 3\u03c0 \u00de \u00bc e \u2212c 1 q 2 \u00f0m 3\u03c0 \u00de , where c 1 is a fit parameter and q is the two-body breakup momentum for a particular isobar at the mass m 3\u03c0 . For the nonresonant term in the 2 \u00fe\u00fe wave, this parametrization is extended to include an explicit t 0 dependence. A simple BW amplitude is used for the a 4 \u00f02040\u00de and the J PC \u00bc 1 \u00fe\u00fe state, a BW amplitude with mass-dependent width for the a 2 \u00f01320\u00de. In the latter, the decay phase space is approximated assuming quasi-twobody decays into 80% \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0 and 20% \u03b7\u03c0.",

            "text": "The result of this fit is shown as curves in Figs. 1(a) to 1(d), in which the model curves describe the data well. The blue curve in Fig. 1(a) reveals the existence of a new axial-vector state in the 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0P wave, which we introduce as a 1 \u00f01420\u00de. This wave collects only 0.25% of the total observed intensity. Its resonance interpretation is supported by the observation of a rapid phase variation by about 180\u00b0across the peak region with respect to the 4 \u00fe\u00fe [see Fig. 1(d)] and 2 \u00fe\u00fe reference waves. As illustrated in Fig. 1(e), the 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0P wave shows similarly rapid phase motion also relative to the 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0S wave. This indicates that the observed structure in the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0 decay mode is not caused by the high-mass tails of the a 1 \u00f01260\u00de, which dominates the \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de\u03c0 wave. Our fit reveals a BW mass for the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de of 1414 MeV=c 2 and a width of 153 MeV=c 2 . The observed shift of the measured peak position with respect to the resonance position in Fig. 1(a) is due to destructive interference of the BW resonance (blue) and the nonresonant term (green). In this wave, the fit model is chosen to cover the mass range up to 1.6 GeV=c 2 . The observed tail of the intensity at higher masses may be attributed to nonresonant contributions that are not described by the present model. The resonance-model fit is performed simultaneously in all 11 bins of t 0 . We allow production strengths and phases of resonances and nonresonant contributions to vary with t 0 . Spectral shapes and BW parameters are assumed to be independent of t 0 . Figure 1(f) shows the resulting t 0 spectrum of the production intensity of the BW amplitude that describes the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de. The BW intensity and that of the nonresonant contribution show a steep, approximately exponential t 0 dependence. Fits with a single exponential yield the slope parameters. Resonances are typically described by slope parameters b \u2248 8 to 10 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u22122 that are smaller than those of the nonresonant contributions with b \u2248 12 to 15 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u22122 [16]. The new a 1 \u00f01420\u00de has a slope parameter of b \u2248 10 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u22122 that is similar to those of a 2 \u00f01320\u00de and a 4 \u00f02040\u00de, which supports its resonance interpretation. The fact that the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de is produced with nearly constant phase offset relative to the a 2 \u00f01320\u00de, independent of t 0 , provides further support for this interpretation. As expected, the slope of the nonresonant contribution in the 1 \u00fe\u00fe wave is steeper with b \u2248 13 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u22122 .",

[21], a broad component denoted \u00bd\u03c0\u03c0 S taken from elastic \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave scattering [22], and the f 0 \u00f01500\u00de described by a simple BW amplitude. The a 1 \u00f01420\u00de is observed only in 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0P, while no signal with corresponding phase motion is seen in 1 \u00fe\u00fe 0 \u00fe \u00bd\u03c0\u03c0 S \u03c0P or any other 1 \u00fe\u00fe wave. In order to confirm the unique coupling of a 1 \u00f01420\u00de to f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0, we have investigated in a separate study [16,23] the structure of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe subsystem forming 0 \u00fe\u00fe isobars using a novel fit procedure for the partial-wave decomposition in bins of m 3\u03c0 and t 0 . Instead of describing the 0 \u00fe\u00fe isobars by several amplitudes with fixed shape, their mass dependence is replaced by a piecewise constant function across m 2\u03c0 , which is determined from data. We thus remove possible bias originating from the isobar model for 0 \u00fe\u00fe . For m 3\u03c0 around the new resonance, a clear intensity correlation of the new a 1 \u00f01420\u00de with the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de is observed within the extracted 0 \u00fe\u00fe isobar amplitude [16].",

Therefore, we performed extensive systematic studies concerning event-selection cuts, the model used in the first step of the PWA fit, as well as wave set and parametrizations employed in the resonancemodel fit. The result is stable under all these studies. The main systematic uncertainties arise from the resonancemodel fit. The estimated total systematic uncertainty is \u00fe15 \u221213 MeV=c 2 for the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de mass and \u00fe8 \u221223 MeV=c 2 for the width.

Using, instead of a simple BW amplitude, one with a massdependent width with f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0 as the only decay channel yields central values for mass and width of 1433 and 146 MeV=c 2 , respectively.

Quark-model calculations including tetra-quark states predict nnnn and nsns isovector states at 1381 and 1530 MeV=c 2 , respectively [24]. The molecular model for the f 1 \u00f01420\u00de proposed in Ref. [8] could possibly be extended to the isovector case. After our first announcement of the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de [25], several explanations were proposed [26][27][28][29], none of them describing all features of the data. The properties of the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de suggest it to be the isospin partner of the f 1 \u00f01420\u00de. This is supported by its mass value of 1414 MeV=c 2 and by its strong coupling to f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, which is interpretable as a KK molecule. The a 1 \u00f01420\u00de width of only 153 MeV=c 2 is narrow as compared to most other known isovector states, which typically have widths between 250 and 350 MeV=c 2 . The much smaller width of the f 1 \u00f01420\u00de of only \u00f054.9 AE 2.6\u00de MeV=c 2 can be explained by its strong coupling to KK \u00c3 with the corresponding phase space being much smaller than that for a 1 \u00f01420\u00de decaying into f 0 \u00f0980\u00de\u03c0.

The red curves in the intensity distributions [panels (a)-(c)] represent the fit model, which is the coherent sum of resonances (blue) and nonresonant contributions (green). The fit is constrained to the mass range indicated by the continuous curves. Extrapolations of the model are shown as dashed curves. Panel (d) shows the relative phase between 1 \u00fe\u00fe and 4 \u00fe\u00fe together with the model curves and (e) the phase between two 1 \u00fe\u00fe decay modes. Here, the different colors distinguish 3 exemplary t 0 bins. The t 0 dependence of the a 1 \u00f01420\u00de intensity is shown in (f) together with the result of a single-exponential fit (red line) yielding a slope parameter of b \u2248 10 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u22122 .",
