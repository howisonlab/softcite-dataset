Such calculations are supported by measurements at the SppS [1,2] and Tevatron [3][4][5] pp colliders. We report the extension of these measurements to significantly higher energies, namely, with pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV provided by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data were collected from April through August, 2010, by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, and correspond JHEP01 (2011)080to an integrated luminosity of (2.88 \u00b1 0.32) pb \u22121 .

The value of A is affected by PDF and renormalization scale uncertainties, while the value of \u03b5 is susceptible to errors from triggering and reconstruction. In order to control the efficiency uncertainties, we concentrate on the extraction of corrections to the efficiencies obtained from the simulation; these correction factors come from efficiency ratios \u03c1 = \u03b5/\u03b5 sim derived by measuring \u03b5 and \u03b5 sim in the same way on data and simulations, respectively. In effect, we replace the product A \u00d7 \u03b5 by the product F \u00d7 \u03c1, where F = A \u00d7 \u03b5 sim is the fraction of generated events selected in the simulation. The values for \u03c1 are derived from data, and hence their uncertainties are experimental; the uncertainties on F derive from the theoretical uncertainties on A. In order to exploit this distinction between experimental and theoretical uncertainties, we also report cross section measurements defined within the restricted acceptance dictated by the detector coverage and minimum transverse momentum; these values incur essentially no theoretical uncertainty.",

The ECAL clusters are designed to collect the largest fraction of the energy of the original electron, including energy radiated along its trajectory.

Electron tracks are reconstructed using an algorithm [10] that accounts for possible energy loss due to bremsstrahlung in the tracker layers. The energy of an electron candidate with E T > 20 GeV is essentially determined by the ECAL cluster energy, while its momentum direction is determined by that of the associated track.

Muon candidates can be reconstructed by two different algorithms: one starts from inner-tracker information (\"tracker muons\"), and another starts from segments in the muon chambers (\"global muons\"). We demand that muon candidates for this analysis be reconstructed by both algorithms. We also demand signals in at least two muon stations, and require that \u03c7 2 /N dof < 10 for a JHEP01 (2011)080global fit containing all valid tracker and muon hits, where N dof is the number of degrees of freedom. The first condition ensures a sensible momentum estimate at the muon trigger level, and further suppresses remaining punch-through and sail-through hadrons. The second condition suppresses contributions from light-meson decays-in-flight.",

We quantify the differences in the tails of these three distributions by an extra parameter in our analytical background function. Using a set of pseudo-experiments to estimate the impact of such differences on the results of the nominal fit, we evaluate the uncertainty due to background subtraction in the W \u2192 e\u03bd analysis to be 1.3%. In the W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd analysis the QCD background shape is tested by refitting the M T spectrum with the background shape fixed to QCD-enriched sample expectations. This choice provides the maximum variation (2.0%) in the signal yield with respect to the reference fit.",

We find internal consistency between measurements in the electron and muon channels and report their combination. We also report ratios of W to Z and W + to W \u2212 production cross sections. The theoretical predictions agree with our measurements, as illustrated in figure 7.",

The experimental uncertainties are smaller than those on the theoretical predictions; they are typically less than 4%. This suggests that the inclusive measurements of W and Z cross sections can potentially be used to normalize the LHC luminosity at the 5% level or better [28]. As most of the systematic uncertainties are statistical in nature, they will decrease with larger data samples, and also benefit from an improved understanding of the CMS detector.",
