            "text": "The hadroproduction of heavy quarkonium states is governed by both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and was extensively studied at the Tevatron [1][2][3][4] and RHIC [5] hadron colliders. Various theoretical approaches, recently reviewed in [6,7], were proposed to describe the data. They mainly differ in the details of the non-perturbative evolution of the heavy quark pair towards a bound state. The models are not able to consistently reproduce the production cross section, the transverse momentum (p T ) distributions and the polarization. Recently, theoretical studies focused on the calculation of NLO and NNLO contributions, finding that their impact on the results is quantitatively important [8][9][10][11][12]. Measurements in the new energy domain of the LHC are crucial for a deeper understanding of the physics involved in hadroproduction processes. Furthermore, the range of Bjorken-x values accessible at LHC energies is unique. Low-p T charmonium measurements, in particular at forward rapidity, are sensitive to an unexplored region (x < 10 \u22125 at Q 2 = m 2 J/\u03c8 ) of the gluon distribution function of the proton.",

During this period, the LHC reached its goal of delivering more than 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 instantaneous luminosity. In ALICE, the instantaneous luminosity was kept to 0.6-1.2 \u00d7 10 29 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in order to have a collision pile-up rate in the same bunch crossing below 5%. In order to increase the statistics for low cross-section processes, ALICE ran, during short periods, at luminosities about 10 times higher, therefore with a much larger pile-up rate in the same bunch crossing. For the analysis presented in this Letter, the collected data were divided into three sub-periods. Each one corresponds to similar average luminosity and pile-up rates, and is characterized by reasonably stable tracking and trigger detector configuration and performance.",

            "text": "The event sample used in this analysis corresponds to minimum bias events (MB trigger) and, for the muon analysis, to events where the detection of at least one muon in the angular acceptance of the muon spectrometer (\u03bc-MB trigger) is additionally required. The MB trigger is defined as the logical OR between the requirement of at least one fired readout chip in the SPD, and a signal in at least one of the two VZERO detectors [24]. It also requires a coincidence with signals from two beam pick-up counters, one on each side of the interaction region, indicating the passage of proton bunches. The \u03bc-MB trigger allows the selection of events where at least one particle was detected in the trigger chambers of the muon spectrometer. The trigger logic is based on the requirement of having at least 3 hits (out of 4) in the trigger stations, both in the bending and non-bending directions [25]. In this way one can define a \"trigger track\", and compute its deviation with respect to a track with infinite momentum. By requiring such a deviation to be smaller than a certain value one can select muon candidate tracks having a transverse momentum larger than a predefined value. Such a p trig T cut can be used to reject soft muons, dominated by \u03c0 and K decays, and is able to limit the muon trigger rate when the machine luminosity is high. The instantaneous luminosity at ALICE allowed for the choice of the lowest p trig T threshold (0.5 GeV/c), leading to a \u03bc-MB trigger rate between 30 and 500 Hz. With this p trig T , the effect of the trigger response function on the J/\u03c8 detection efficiency is negligible. Note that the effect of such a cut is not sharp and that the selection efficiency reaches the plateau value only at p T \u223c 1.5 GeV/c. Finally, in order to limit the systematic uncertainties related to non-uniformities in the detector response, data were collected by periodically varying the polarities of the solenoidal and dipole magnets. The particle identification performance of the TPC is essential for the J/\u03c8 measurement. In Fig. 1 the specific energy loss in the TPC is shown as a function of momentum in the region of interest for the present measurement. A \u00b13\u03c3 inclusion cut for electrons and a \u00b13.5\u03c3 (\u00b13\u03c3 ) exclusion cuts for pions (protons) were employed. As seen in Fig. 1, with our current identification strategy, the electron identification is performed with an efficiency better than 50% for momenta below 7-8 GeV/c. Electron candidates compatible, together with a positron candidate, with being products of \u03b3 conversions were removed, in order to reduce the combinatorial background. It was verified, using a Monte Carlo simulation, that this procedure does not affect the J/\u03c8 signal.  The invariant mass distribution for the opposite-sign (OS) electron pairs is shown in Fig. 2. In the same figure we also show the background contribution, obtained as the sum of the like-sign (LS) pairs, N ++ + N \u2212\u2212 , scaled to match the integral of the OS distribution in the mass interval 3.2-5.0 GeV/c 2 . The scale factor, 1.23, originates from the presence of correlated background (mostly from semi-leptonic charm decays) in the OS distribution, but is also influenced by misidentified electrons and by electrons from conversions. In the top panel of Fig. 2 we also show the background estimated using a track rotation method (TrkRot), 2 used later in the estimate of the systematic uncertainties related to signal extraction. The signal, obtained by subtracting the scaled LS distribution from the OS, is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 in comparison with the signal from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (described below). A good agreement between data and MC is observed, both for the bulk of the signal and for the bremsstrahlung tail. Integration of the signal in the mass range 2.92-3.16 GeV/c 2 yields N J/\u03c8 = 352 \u00b1 32 (stat.) \u00b1 28 (syst.) counts (the systematic uncertainty on this quantity is described below); the signal to background ratio is S/B = 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 and the significance is For the dimuon channel, the total data sample available for physics analysis amounts to 1.9 \u00d7 10 8 MB events, of which 1.0 \u00d7 10 7 satisfy the \u03bc-MB condition.",

First, events are required to have at least one interaction vertex reconstructed by the SPD. This cut rejects 0.5% of the statistics. Then, it is required that at least one of the two muon candidates matches the corresponding hits in the trigger chambers.

We have also varied the invariant mass ranges for the signal extraction and for background normalization. The value obtained is 8%. Including the contribution from the uncertainty on the material budget leads to a value of 8.5%. For the muon channel, various tests were performed. In particular, we tried to release in the fit the values of the parameters governing the asymmetric left tail of the Crystal Ball line shape, which were fixed to their MC values in the default fitting procedure. Alternative functions for the description of the signal and background shapes were also used. In particular, for the J/\u03c8 a variable-width Gaussian function, adopted in the past by the NA50 and NA60 Collaborations [35], was used. For the background, a different shape was tested, based on a Gaussian having a width continuously increasing with the mass. The estimated overall systematic uncertainty on the signal extraction is 7.5%. -The acceptance calculation depends on the y and p T input distributions. For the electrons, the uncertainty is mainly determined by the choice of the p T spectrum. By varying the p T of the input distribution within a factor 2, a 1.5% variation in the acceptance was obtained. Such a small value is indeed a consequence of the weak p T dependence of the acceptance for the bulk of the spectrum. For the muons, both y and p T were varied, using as alternative distributions those expected for pp collisions at \u221a s = 4 and 10 TeV [36]. As a further test, the measured J/\u03c8 differential distributions obtained from the analysis described later in Section 6, were used as an input in the calculation of the acceptance. In this way, a 5% systematic uncertainty on this quantity was determined. The larger systematic uncertainty for the muon channel is due to the larger influence, for this channel, of the choice of the shape of the rapidity distribution. -The uncertainty on the muon trigger efficiency calculation was estimated comparing N cor J/\u03c8 for the sample where only one of the two decay muons is required to match the trigger condition, with the same quantity for the sample where both muons satisfy that condition. The 4% discrepancy between the two quantities is taken as the systematic uncertainty on the evaluation of the trigger efficiency.",

For the muon analysis, the systematic uncertainty can be estimated by comparing determinations of the tracking efficiency based on real data and on a MC approach. In the first case, the tracking efficiency can be evaluated starting from the determination of the efficiency per chamber, computed using the redundancy of the tracking information in each station. The values thus obtained are in the range from 91.8 to 99.8%. The tracking efficiency evaluated starting from these chamber efficiencies is (98.8 \u00b1 0.8)%. The very same procedure, in (30% of the efficiency loss discussed above) was assumed, to take into account possible small-area correlations that could be missed in the present approach. Combining this error with the one previously mentioned, the overall systematic uncertainty on the muon tracking efficiency is 1.5%, which gives 3% for muon pair detection. -The error on the luminosity measurement is dominated by the 4% systematic uncertainty on the determination of \u03c3 V0AND , which is due to the uncertainties on the beam intensities [37] and on the analysis procedure related to the van der Meer scan of the V0AND signal.

In particular, d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dp T was studied in seven bins between 0 and 8 GeV/c, and d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dy in five bins between 2.5 and 4. The event sample used for the determination of the differential cross sections is slightly smaller (by about 15%, corresponding to L int = 13.3 nb \u22121 ) than the one analyzed for the integrated cross section. This is due to the fact that the statistics in one of the three sub-periods of the data taking is too small to allow a satisfactory fit of the differential invariant mass spectra.",

Anyway, the results of the fit, for what concerns N J/\u03c8 , are quite insensitive to the precise level of the \u03c8(2S) contribution. It has been verified, for example, that fixing for each p T bin the ratios \u03c8(2S)/(J/\u03c8) to the values measured (in the range p T > 2 GeV/c) by CDF [39], N J/\u03c8 varies by less than 1%.",

For the rapidity distribution, the values obtained in the forward region were also reflected with respect to y = 0. In both figures, the symbols are plotted at the center of each bin. The statistical and systematic errors were added in quadrature, apart from the 4 (5.5)% systematic uncertainties on luminosity for the dielectron (dimuon) channels, shown as boxes. The differential cross sections shown in Figs. 6 and 7 assume unpolarized J/\u03c8 production. Systematic uncertainties due to the unknown J/\u03c8 polarization are not shown. Our results are compared with those by the CMS [15], LHCb [16] and ATLAS [17] Collaborations. Also for these data the uncertainty due to luminosity, which is 11% for CMS, 10% for LHCb and 3.4% for ATLAS, is shown separately (boxes), while the error bars contain the statistical and the other sources of systematic errors added in quadrature. Our measurement at central rapidity reaches p T = 0 and is therefore complementary to the data of CMS, available at |y| < 1.2 for p T > 6.5 GeV/c, and AT-LAS, which covers the region |y| < 0.75, p T > 7 GeV/c. In order to compare our d 2 \u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dp T d y in the forward rapidity range with that of LHCb, we added the LHCb data for prompt and non-prompt production and integrated in the range 2.5 < y < 4 to match our measurement. The agreement between the two data sets is good. In Fig. 7 our results are compared with the corresponding values from the CMS and LHCb experiments, for the rapidity bins where the p T coverage extends down to zero (ATLAS has no coverage down to p T = 0 in any rapidity range). For CMS, the value for 1.6 < |y| < 2.4 was obtained by integrating the published d 2 \u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dp T d y data [15], while for LHCb the published d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dy for prompt and non-prompt production [16] were added. Our data, together with that of the other LHC experiments, constitute a comprehensive measurement of inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross section as a function of rapidity. At the LHC, the inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross section at central rapidity is almost twice larger than at Tevatron ( \u221a s = 1.96 TeV) [1] and about ten times larger than at RHIC ( \u221a s = 0.2 TeV) [5]. The width (FWHM) of the rapidity distribution derived from our data is about twice larger than at RHIC [5].",

Therefore the measured yield is a superposition of a direct component and of J/\u03c8 coming from the decay of higher-mass charmonium states, in particular the \u03c7 c1 , \u03c7 c2 and \u03c8(2S) states. These contributions were measured in lower-energy experiments and were found to be \u223c25% (\u03c7 c1 + \u03c7 c2 ) and \u223c8% (\u03c8(2S)) of the total measured J/\u03c8 yield [40,41]. The \u03c7 c0 contribution is negligible since its B.R. into J/\u03c8 is of the order of 1%. In addition to this \"prompt\" production, decays of beauty hadrons are also known to give a sizeable contribution (of the order of 10-15% in the p T range accessed by ALICE [16]) to the observed J/\u03c8 yield. With future high-statistics data samples, the ALICE experiment will identify, at central rapidities, J/\u03c8 from b-decays, via the measurement of the pseudo-proper decay time distributions [42], and will also reconstruct the \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03b3 decay [43]. At forward rapidity, the contribution from b-decays will be estimated from the beauty cross section measurement carried out in the semi-leptonic decay channel [44].",

The signal to background ratio, in the mass range 2.9 < m \u03bc\u03bc < 3.3 GeV/c 2 , varies between 2.3 and 2.9 in the various sub-periods.
