When produced at experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary proton-proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments -as well as those working on dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEXb, and FASER -to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3 and at the High-Luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches; document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity \"dark showers\", highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for these signals.",

Because the focus of the current document is on the experimental signatures of LLPs and explicitly not the theories that predict them, the combination of the MATHUSLA physics case document (and the large number of references therein) and the present document can be considered, together, a comprehensive view of the Similarly, models beyond the SM (BSM) typically predict new particles with a variety of lifetimes. In particular, new weak-scale particles can easily have long lifetimes for several reasons, including approximate symmetries that stabilize the long-lived particle (LLP), small couplings between the LLP and lighter states, and suppressed phase space available for decays. For particles moving close to the speed of light, this can lead to macroscopic, detectable displacements between the production and decay points of an unstable particle for c\u03c4 10 \u00b5m. 1 The experimental signatures of LLPs at the LHC are varied and, by nature, are often very different from signals of SM processes. For example, LLP signatures can include tracks with unusual ionization and propagation properties; small, localized deposits of energy inside of the calorimeters without associated tracks; stopped particles that decay out of time with collisions; displaced vertices in the inner detector or muon spectrometer; and disappearing, appearing, and kinked tracks. 9 so where do we start? 24   Figure 1.2: Schematic of the variety of challenging, atypical experimental signatures that can result from BSM LLPs in the detectors at the LHC.

Existing LLP searches have necessitated the development of novel methods for identifying signals of LLPs, and measuring and suppressing the relevant backgrounds. Indeed, in several scenarios searches for LLPs have sensitivities that greatly exceed the search for similar, promptly decaying new particles (as is true, for example, for directly produced staus in supersymmetry [4]).

Given the excellent sensitivity of LHC detectors to LLPs, along with the potentially large production cross sections of LLPs and the enormous amount of data expected to be collected when the LHC switches to high-luminosity running in the 2020s, it is imperative that the space of LLP signatures be explored as thoroughly as possible to ensure that no signals are missed. This is particularly important now, with the recent conclusion of LHC Run 2, as new triggering strategies for LLP signatures in the upcoming Run 3 can be investigated with urgency. Moreover, decisions are currently being made about detector upgrades for Phase 2 of the LHC, and design choices should be made to ensure that sensitivity to LLPs is retained or possibly improved through high-luminosity running, as may indeed be the case for many of the plans under consideration by the main experiments.",

Workshops focused on LLPs at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst 2 , in November of 2015; Fermilab; and KITP (UCSB) 3 in May of 2016, among others, highlighted the need for a community-wide effort to map the current space of both theoretical models for LLPs and the atypical experimental signatures that could be evidence of LLPs, assess the coverage of current experimental methods to these models, and identify areas where new searches are required. Additionally, the work presented in these meetings underscored the importance of presenting the results of experimental searches in a manner that allows for their application to different models, and generated new ideas for designing analyses with the goal of minimizing model dependence. Such largely model-independent presentation makes current searches more powerful by increasing their applicability to new scenarios, while reducing redundancies in searches and ensuring that gaps in coverage are identified and addressed.

Simplified models have driven the development of searches for new signatures at the LHC and allowed existing searches to be reinterpreted for many models beyond the one(s) initially targeted in the analysis. Comprehensive simplified model programs exist for scenarios featuring prompt decays of new particles [65][66][67][68][69][70][71] or dark matter produced at colliders [72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83]. Simplified models are so successful because the majority of search sensitivity is driven by only a few broad aspects of a given BSM signature, such as the production process, overall production rate, and decay topology. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of searches is typically insensitive to other properties such as the spin of the particles involved [84][85][86][87].",

We elaborate on these goals in Section 2.1. This framework helps illuminate gaps in coverage and highlight areas where new searches are needed, and we undertake such a study in Chapter 3. Our efforts build on earlier work proposing simplified model programs for LLPs motivated by particular considerations such as SUSY or dark matter (DM) [88][89][90][91][92][93].",

In a UV model where the LLP decays in a very large number of ways, none of the individual simplified model searches may be sufficient to constrain it. Similarly, if the LLP is produced in a UV model with other associated objects that spoil the signal efficiency (for example, the production of energetic, prompt objects collimated with the LLP such that the signal fails isolation or displacement criteria; this is particularly important for highmultiplicity or dark-shower scenarios, as discussed in Chapter 7), then the simplified model result does not apply and a more targeted analysis is required to cover the model. Nevertheless, the simplified models framework allows us to organize possible production modes and signatures in a systematic way and identify if there are any interesting signals or parts of parameter space that are missed by current searches.Therefore, we present a proposal for simplified models here with the understanding that there exist scenarios where UV models remain important for developing searches and presenting results.",

We emphasize that each of these categories is a broad umbrella containing many different individual models containing LLPs; in many cases, the motivations and model details among theories within a particular category may be very different, but tend to predict similar types of LLPs. Additionally, the categories are not mutually exclusive, with several examples of UV models falling into one or more category. In all cases, long lifetimes typically arise from some combination of hierarchies of scales in interactions that mediate decays; small couplings; and phase space considerations (such as small mass splittings between particles or large multiplicities of final-state particles in a decay). Many of the broad theoretical motivations for LLPs have recently been summarized in the literature [2]. The UV umbrella models we consider are:",

Here LLPs can arise as a result of approximate symmetries (such as R-parity [52,103,104] or indeed SUSY itself in the case of gauge mediation [105]) or through a hierarchy of mass scales (such as highly off-shell intermediaries in split SUSY [106], or nearly-degenerate multiplets [56,57,107], as in anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking [58]). Finally, models of SUSY hidden sectors such as Stealth SUSY [51] generically lead to LLPs. Our terminology classifies any non-SUSY models with new SM gauge-charged particles, such as composite Higgs or extra-dimensional models, under the SUSYlike umbrella because of the prediction of new particles above the weak scale with SM gauge charges. In this category, LLP production is typically dominated by SM gauge interactions, whether of the LLP itself or of a heavy parent particle that de-cays to LLPs.",

This possibility is well motivated because the SM Higgs field provides one of the leading renormalizable portals for new gauge-singlet particles to couple to the SM, and the experimental characterization of the Higgs boson leaves much scope for couplings of the Higgs to BSM physics [108,109]. The most striking signatures here are exotic Higgs decays to low-mass particles [110] (as in many Hidden Valley scenarios [59,60]), which can arise in models of neutral naturalness [13,14,111] and DM [112], as well as in more exotic scenarios such as relaxion models [113]. The Higgs is also special in that it comes with a rich set of associated production modes in addition to the dominant gluon-fusion process, with vector-boson fusion (VBF) and Higgs-strahlung (VH) production modes allowing novel opportunities for triggering on and suppressing backgrounds to Higgs-portal LLP signatures. Indeed, in many scenarios where LLPs are produced in exotic Higgs decays, associated-production modes can be the only way of triggering on the event.",

If the RHNs have masses in the GeV to TeV range, they typically have a long lifetime and can be probed at the LHC [38, 43-45, 47, 48, 156-167]. Examples of well-motivated, UV-complete models with RHNs include the neutrino minimal SM (\u03bdMSM) [168,169] and the left\u2212right symmetric model [170][171][172][173]. Characteristic features of models in this category are LLPs produced singly via SM neutraland charged-current interactions, and lepton-rich signatures in terms of prompt and displaced objects (often in association with quarks). For example, in extended scenarios like left\u2212right symmetric models, production through new right-handed W and Z bosons can result in between one and four LLPs, and cascade decays between RHNs can lead to phenomena such as doubly displaced decays. Additionally, RHNs can be produced via Higgs decays [40,41,44,163,165,174].",

For example, a SUSY theory with a stable lightest SUSY particle (LSP) could have the LSP serve as a dark matter candidate, while alternatively DM could be a new electroweak multiplet, giving rise to SUSY-like signatures [57,[121][122][123]. In other models featuring particles charged under a confining gauge group (such as \"quirks\" [175]), there can exist many production possibilities for the LLPs, including via the Higgs portal and the annihilation of new TeV-scale states (see, for example, Ref. [176]). Thus, the umbrella models should not be considered as exclusive categories, but rather as over-arching scenarios that motivate particular classes of signatures (such as new SM gaugecharged particles in the SUSY-like category, or presence of / E T in DM models).",

Higher-mass LLPs can still be produced via an off-shell Higgs, albeit at substantially lower rates [26,179].

However, the reader should be cautioned that this does not necessarily mean that the \"natural\" trigger is optimal for a particular signal. For example, the HIG modes suggest the use of VBF-or V H-based triggers, but if the LLP decays leptonically, it might be more efficient to trigger on the lepton from the LLP decay. Thus, the final word on which trigger is most effective for a given simplified model depends on the production mode as well as the nature and kinematics of the LLP decay.

            "text": "The fact that LLP searches can be sensitive to many LLP decay modes is, in part, because LLPs that decay far from the collision point offer fewer avenues for particle identification. For example, for an LLP decaying inside of the calorimeter, most decay products are reconstructed as missing energy, or an energy deposition in the calorimeter. Consequently, particle identification criteria are typically relaxed in comparison to requirements on searches without displaced objects. Indeed, these \"loose\" collider objects can differ searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 23 significantly from the corresponding \"tight\", prompt objects. This leads to more inclusive analyses that can cover a wider range of signatures with a single search. Additionally, backgrounds for LLP searches are often small; for a comprehensive discussion of backgrounds to LLP searches, see Chapter 4. As a result, tight identification and/or reconstruction criteria typically found in exclusive prompt analyses are no longer needed to suppress backgrounds. For example, ATLAS has a displaced vertex search sensitive to di-lepton and multi-track vertices that is relatively inclusive with respect to other objects originating from near the displaced vertex [189]. Similarly, CMS has an analysis sensitive to events with one each of a high-impact-parameter muon and electron without reconstructing a vertex or any other objects [190]. For these examples, the backgrounds are sufficiently low that other requirements may be relaxed and the specific decay mode of the LLP may not be too important so long as certain objects (such as muons) are present or the decay occurs in a specific location. An even more extreme example in this regard is the search for highly-ionizing tracks sensitive to electrically and color-charged LLPs. While the searches are primarily targeted to detector-stable particles (heavy stable charged particles or R-hadrons) they can also be used to probe intermediate lifetimes for which only a certain fraction of LLPs traverse the tracker before decaying (see e.g. [135]). Both because of low backgrounds as well as modified particle identification criteria compared to prompt searches, LLP searches can often be inclusive and therefore covered by a more limited range of simplified models.",

However, the top quark immediately decays to final states that are covered in the above list, giving an effective semileptonic decay mode (t \u2192 b + \u03bd) and a hadronic decay mode (t \u2192 bjj) of the LLP.

As another example, if the LLP couples to the SM via mixing with the SM Higgs boson, then the LLP decays via mass-proportional couplings giving rise to b-and \u03c4-rich signatures. If, instead, the LLP decays through a kinetic mixing as in the case of dark photons or Z bosons, then the LLP can decay to any particle charged under the weak interactions, giving rise to a relatively large leptonic branching fraction in addition to hadronic decay modes. This allows some level of prioritization of decay modes based on motivated UV-complete models; for example, the Higgs-portal model prioritizes searches for heavyflavor quarks and leptons in LLP decay, while the gauge-portal model prioritizes searches for electrons and muons in LLP decay. Ultimately, however, it is desirable to retain independent sensitivity to each individual decay mode as much as possible.

These models may therefore serve as a starting point for systematically understanding experimental coverage of LLP signatures and devising new searches, but may need to be extended in future for the purposes of facilitating reinterpretation. We undertake an in-depth discussion of these topics in Section 6. We classify LLPs according to their SM gauge charges, as these dictate the dominant or allowed LLP production and decay modes, and can give rise to different signatures (for example, disappearing tracks and hadronized LLPs). We separately consider LLPs that are: (a) neutral; (b) electrically charged but color neutral; and (c) color charged. In the latter case, it is important to distinguish between the long-lived parton (which carries a charge under quantum chromodynamics, QCD) that hadronizes prior to decay, and the physical LLP, which is a color-singlet \"R-hadron\" (using the standard nomenclature inspired by SUSY).

One of these is the disappearing track signature [56-58, 92, 121-123, 187, 188], in which a charged LLP decays to a nearly degenerate neutral particle. The lifetime is long in this scenario due to the tiny mass splitting between the two states. Formally, these are included in the chargino or slepton DPP modes in Table 2.2 with decays to + inv. or qq + inv. taken in the limit where the splitting between the charged LLP and the invisible final state is of O(200 MeV). In the case of a hadronic decay, X decays to a soft pion that is very challenging to reconstruct and so the track simply disappears. This is an important scenario that is already the topic of existing searches [210,211]. As the degeneracy between the charged LLP and the neutral state is relaxed, other signatures are possible; this parameter range is well motivated both by SUSY and DM models with coannihilation [91,129,130]. searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 31 indicates that this particle production \u00d7 decay scenario is not present in the simplest and most minimal implementations or spectra of the umbrella model, but could be present in extensions of the minimal models.

The modeling of hadronization and subsequent propagation is directly related to many properties of the long-lived parton, such as electric charge, flavor, and spin. Event generators such as Pythia 8 have routines [212,213] to simulate LLP hadronization, although it is unclear how precise these predictions are. For a point of comparison, using the default settings of Pythia 8 yields an estimate of the neutral R-hadron fraction from a gluino (color-octet fermion,g) of approximately 54%, while the neutral R-hadron fraction for a stop (scalar top partner) is estimated to be 44% [89]. After hadronization, the charge of the R-hadron may change as it passes through the detector. For instance, some estimates [214,215] suggest that heavy, color-octet gluinosg would predominantly form mesons (e.g., (ugd)) at first. They eventually drop to the lower-energy neutral singlet baryon\u039b = (guds) state when interacting with the protons and neutrons within the calorimeters.",

Depending on how the LLP program expands and develops over the next few years, it may become expedient to expand the simplified model library to include sets of events in a standard format (such as the Les Houches format [217]) that can be directly fed into event-generator and detector-simulation programs. Given the factorization of produc-tion and decay of LLPs that is valid for neutral LLPs, this could involve two mini-libraries: a set of production events for LLPs and a set of decay events for LLPs, along with a protocol for \"stitching\" the events together.",

For example, quirks are LLPs that are charged under a hidden-sector gauge interaction that confines at macroscopic scales [175]. Because the confinement scale can be just about any distance, quirks can have very unusual properties; as a specific example, if electrically charged quirk-antiquirk pairs are bound on the millimeter or centimeter level, they behave as an electric dipole and therefore do not leave conventional tracks that bend in the magnetic field. Other confinement scales give rise to different behaviors, such as meta-searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 37 12 Ideally, this software would be well-documented to facilitate sharing between experiments. A successful example of readily shareable software between experiments is the G4 package for R-hadrons and other particles' interaction with matter, found at http: //r-hadrons.web.cern.ch/r-hadrons/ stable heavy charged particles and non-helical tracks [232,233]. In scenarios where the quirks carry color charge, the quirks hadronize and can undergo charge-flipping interactions as they move through the detector. These quirk scenarios can be challenging to model, and no public code exists that allows for the propagation and interaction of quirks with the detector material; we encourage the collaborations to validate and release any internal software they may have to study the propagation of quirks (for more discussion, see the discussion of quirks in Section 3.5) 12 .",

The presented framework is only the first step of a simplified model program that is comprehensive in terms of generating LHC signatures and allowing straightforward reinterpretation of experimental results for UV models. The framework we have developed with separate, modular components for LLP production and decay is amenable to expansion, and we encourage members of the theory and experimental communities to continue to do so over the coming years to ensure maximal utility of the simplified models framework. One significant simplification we have undertaken in our framework is to define a \"jet\" as any of j = u, c, d, s, b, g. In reality, different partons give rise to different signatures, especially when one of the \"jets\" is a heavy-flavor quark. Jets initiated by b and c quarks have some useful distinguishing features, such as the fact that the underlying heavy-flavor meson decays at a distance slightly displaced from the proton interaction vertex and that there are often associated soft leptons resulting from meson decays. In particular, it is possible that the soft muons associated with B-meson decays could be used to enhance trigger and reconstruction prospects for LLPs decaying to b-jets [234]. However, heavy quarks also constitute an important backgrounds for LLP searches, and so LLPs decaying to b-and c-jets may necessitate dedicated treatment in future. Similarly, LLP decays to \u03c4 leptons may merit further specialized studies.",

            "text": "Another property of the current framework is that it is restricted to LLP signatures of low multiplicity. By \"low multiplicity\", we mean collider signatures with one or two LLPs. Searches inspired by these models are also suitable for many scenarios with three or four LLPs per event (which include models with dark-Higgs decays into lepton-jets [148], or left\u2212right symmetric models [162]), since the LLP signatures are generally extremely rare and so only one or two typically need to be identified in a given event to greatly suppress backgrounds. Thus, as long as the search is inclusive with respect to possible additional displaced objects, the signature can be covered with low-multiplicity strategies. As the LLP multiplicity grows, however, the simplified model space we have presented requires modification. This is both because the individual LLPs grow softer, making them harder to reconstruct on an individual level, and they become less separated in the detector, which makes isolation and identification of signal a challenge. On the other hand, the high LLP multiplicity may allow for new handles for further rejecting backgrounds, and the kinematics can vary widely based on the model (for example, in some \"quirky\" scenarios, LLPs can be produced in a variety of ways with different kinematic distributions [113]). In extreme cases, signals can even mimic pile-up [235]. High-multiplicity signatures therefore require dedicated modeling, and we defer the study of these signatures to Chapter 7.",

Any simplified model set-up, however, cannot cover every single UV model without becoming as complex as the UV model space itself. As with the case of promptly decaying new particles, care must also be taken in the interpretation of simplified models [71,[79][80][81]99]: for example, constraints on simplified models assuming 100% branching fractions of LLPs to a particular final state may not accurately represent the constraint on a full model due to the large multiplicity of possible decay modes. There will additionally always be very well-motivated models that predict specific signatures that are challenging to incorporate into the simplified model framework outlined here. Experimental searches for these signatures should still be done where possible, but we encourage theorists and experimentalists alike to think carefully about how to design such searches so as to retain maximal sensitivity to simplified models that may give rise to similar signatures. 1 It is true that, depending on the signature, some of these caveats can be circumvented by a sensible use of existing prompt triggers. For example, photon triggers will collect displaced electrons, calorimeter/jet triggers will record displaced hadronic vertices, etc.",

Backgrounds for LLP searches typically include peripheral or machine effects, those rarely important for searches for prompt physics, including cosmic muons, beam halo, detector noise, and cavern backgrounds. Such backgrounds are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. As rare as these backgrounds typically are, their rates are not completely negligible, and particular, modeldependent selection requirements (based on, for instance, the LLP mass range or specific decay modes) must be made to reduce backgrounds as much as possible and, in some cases, make the searches \"background-free\". Additionally, many default object reconstruction algorithms are not designed to detect particles originating from decays of LLPs, and so dedicated reconstruction of tracks, jets, leptons, or other objects may be required for LLP searches. Taken altogether, these factors make LLP searches very different from searches for prompt objects, and the following discussion additionally aims to collate and summarize the current techniques for LLP reconstruction at the LHC.",

Because long-lived particles travel macroscopic distances in the detectors, many of the search strategies rely on the identification of displaced objects, namely SM particles (charged leptons, photons, hadrons, jets) that are produced at a location away from the primary vertex (PV) where the hard pp collision takes place. The secondary vertex at which the decay of the LLP occurs is referred to as a displaced vertex (DV). As far as possible, our classification of searches is linked to the parton-level objects produced in LLP decays, which allows a relatively straightforward linkage to LLP models (as well as simplified models; see Chapter 2). Borrowing the terminology from prompt searches, we consider the following categories for the analogous displaced objects produced in LLP decays: all-hadronic (jets), leptonic, semi-leptonic, and photonic. However, we caution the reader that these \"jets\" or \"photons\" may not be of the standard type, and so other objects may pass the selections of these analyses. The remaining searches fall in the \"other long-lived exotics\" category, mostly consisting of non-standard tracks (disappearing tracks, heavy stable charged particles, quirks, etc.), but also including some trackless signals, such as stopped particles and Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs). These categories are not to be interpreted as exclusive; many models and searches could fit into several categories. 2 For example, Refs. [236][237][238] show how searches for different signatures and LLP lifetimes can be combined to cover large parts of the parameter spaces of particular UV models.",

An ATLAS 13 TeV search [230] uses a standard / E T trigger and an offline requirement of / E T > 250 GeV. The 8 TeV search [189] covers a larger range of topologies, and the event must have either / E T > 180 GeV or contain four, five, or six jets with p T > 90, 65, or 55 GeV to pass the trigger. In both searches, the ID vertex is required to have at least 5 tracks and the invariant mass of the displaced vertex tracks to fullfil m DV > 10 GeV. These searches are interpreted in the context of various SUSY scenarios involving gluinos or squarks decaying into leptons, jets and missing energy, namely R-Parity-Violating (RPV), General Gauge Mediation (GGM), and split SUSY. In the latter case R-hadrons 3 are considered. The particular LLP decay topology determines which trigger and analysis mode (specified by jet and lepton multiplicity, small/large / E T , etc.) has the best sensitivity. The LLPs covered by these searches are typically high mass ( 100 GeV), and correspond to the directpair-production and heavy-parent production modes with hadronic decays (in the language of the simplified models presented in Section 2). However, these searches do not have sensitivity to low-mass LLPs, especially those resulting from the Higgs, Z , or chargedcurrent production portals and then decaying hadronically.",

It is efficient for LLPs that decay between 3 -7 m transversely or 5 -13 m longitudinally from the PV, for LLP masses greater than 10 GeV. After trigger selection, the ATLAS analysis in question requires either two reconstructed DVs in the MS [250] or one ID vertex and one MS vertex [241]. This ID-MS combination provides increased sensitivity to shorter lifetimes than an analysis only considering MS vertices, and shows good sensitivity to 100 GeV < m \u03a6 < 900 GeV and 10 GeV < m s < 150 GeV. Decays of a SM-like Higgs boson to LLP pairs are constrained below 1% in the most sensitive c\u03c4 regions (with cross section limits as low as 50 fb). The efficiency degrades for benchmarks with higher LLP boosts or very low mass LLPs, as fewer tracks are reconstructed. Another ATLAS search includes signal regions with only 1 DV in the MS, with sensitivity to SM-like Higgs decays to LLPs extending down to branching fractions of 0.1% [251]; this search also presents constraints on a wide range of models that helps facilitate reinterpretation for other BSM scenarios. In addition, a combination of the results from this search with the results from the 13 TeV CalRatio search was performed in Ref.

The trigger for the 13 TeV analysis based on 2015 data additionally requires either two jets with p T > 40 GeV and no more than two associated prompt tracks (d 0 < 1 mm) and the H T threshold is lowered to 350 GeV if the two jets each have at least one track that originates far from the PV 6 . Only events with two or more displaced jets are kept in the analysis, while those with only one are used as a control sample to estimate the prompt jet misidentification rate. For c\u03c4 < 3 mm 7 , the algorithm is inefficient as more than two tracks tend to have impact parameters less than 1 mm; for c\u03c4 > 1 m the search is inefficient as most decays occur too far from the PV to form reconstructable tracks.

It is evident that the requirements on H T and on p T,j make the search inefficient for low LLP masses. Indeed, a phenomenological recast of the 8 TeV analysis [244] in terms of rare decays of a SM-like Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV Higgs sets very mild bounds for LLP masses below m h /2 [253].

The trigger thresholds are, however, low. For example, the invariant mass of particles associated with the vertex must exceed 2 GeV and the scalar sum p T of tracks at the vertex must exceed 3 GeV. Jet reconstruction is then performed offline with standard algorithms. The benchmark model used by these searches is a scalar particle decaying to two neutral LLPs, \u03c0 v (dark or \"valley\" pions), which corresponds to the Higgs simplified model with hadronic decay modes. The parent particle can be either a SM-like 125 GeV Higgs [246] or a Higgs-like scalar with mass in the 80-140 GeV range [247]. The search is performed for \u03c0 v masses between 25 and 50 GeV and decay lenghts between 0.6 and 15 mm. It is expected that LHCb will extend their coverage to shorter lifetimes by improving the understanding of the material and to lower masses by using fat-jets and jet-substructure to access larger boosts [254]. In principle, the search is also sensitive to direct pair production of LLPs. Because of the low thresholds, the LHCb search focuses on lowmass LLPs with short lifetimes, for which it has excellent sensitivity. However, its sensitivity for other signatures is limited by the geometry of the detector and the LHCb luminosity compared to ATLAS and CMS. A model-dependent direct comparison among the LHCb, ATLAS and CMS reaches for the Higgs production mode decaying into dark pion LLPs can be seen in Figure 3.1.   [189], CMS [244] and LHCb [246] reaches for dark pions \u03c0 V decaying into jets. The CMS result is taken from the recast done in reference [253] of the 8 TeV analysis [244]. In the shaded regions B(H \u2192 \u03c0 v \u03c0 v ) is constrained to be below 50%. Note that the ATLAS reach extends to higher masses as well; the plot was produced using the benchmark scenarios presented in [189], hence the meaningful bound is on the lifetimes. Taken from Ref. [246]. 8 Highly-inclusive searches for single LLPs decaying in the ATLAS MS have been proposed [255], finding that backgrounds are appreciable and need to be controlled using data-driven methods.",

The ATLAS 8 TeV study [189] does employ multiple triggers (such as lepton triggers), but in each case the triggered object must be associated with the DV (for a lepton trigger, the lepton must originate from the DV). If, instead, a prompt lepton or VBF trigger were used with the offline reconstruction of a separate displaced object, sensitivity could be recovered to low-mass hadronic DVs in a variety of simplified models, including Higgs production (via VBF or VH associated production modes) [253,256] or charged-current production (in association with a prompt lepton) [257]. In particular, triggering on associated prompt objects would improve the efficiency of reconstructing low-mass hadronic LLPs produced in the decays of a SM-like 125 GeV Higgs. As there is no theoretical lower limit on the masses of light neutral LLPs, it is imperative to lower the LLP mass coverage as much as possible. If at all possible, a dedicated online reconstruction of DVs would allow for a further reduction on the p T threshold, giving sensitivity to light LLP masses.",

CMS also has a search requiring exactly one isolated muon and one isolated electron (i.e., events with additional isolated leptons are discarded) with large transverse impact parameters (0.2 cm < |d 0 | < 10 cm), but without any other additional requirement including, for example, that the reconstructed tracks do not need to point to a common vertex [190]. This loose selection makes the search sensitive to a variety of new physics scenarios. Light and boosted LLPs can decay into collimated light leptons, dubbed lepton-jets [120], which are searched for at both CMS [263,264] and ATLAS. ATLAS has searches for both displaced [265,266] and prompt lepton-jets [267]. The LHCb collaboration also looks for light, neutral LLPs decaying into \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 47",

            "text": "The CMS searches trigger on leptons reconstructed using information from either the tracker [258] or the muon chambers [259], where the latter search uses only muons. In the tracker-based analysis, the LLP is reconstructed by forming pairs of charged leptons (where muons are required to have opposite signs), with p T cuts of 26 GeV for muons, and 36 (21) GeV for the leading (subleading) electron. This yields slightly larger efficiencies in the muon channel. The transverse impact parameter |d 0 | needs to be 12 times larger than its uncertainty \u03c3 d (approximately corresponding to a distance 200 \u00b5m) to reject prompt backgrounds. In the MSbased analysis, muon candidates are reconstructed using hits in the muon chambers, and no information from the silicon tracker is used. In order to avoid biases from a loose beamspot constraint in the seeding step, these muons undergo an additional refit step. These candidates are referred to as re-fitted stand-alone (RSA) muons, and they need to fulfill p T > 26 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2, and to be separated by \u2206R > 0.2. More importantly, these candidates are rejected if they can be matched to a p T > 10 GeV track in the inner tracker, which efficiently excludes prompt muons and also renders this study fully complementary to the tracker-based one. Both these searches are interpreted in terms of decays of an SM-like Higgs H (H \u2192 XX, X \u2192 l + l \u2212 ) and RPV squarks, covering proper lifetimes of 0.01-10 5 cm for the Higgs scenario, and 0.1-10 4 cm for the SUSY case. The difference in the lower reach of c\u03c4 is due to the larger boost factor of the Higgs. These benchmarks map to the direct pair production, heavy parent and Higgs production simplified models, with flavor-conserving leptonic decays of the LLP. There is good sensitivity down to relatively low masses (LLPs of masses 20 GeV produced in Higgs decays) due to the low lepton trigger thresholds.",

Indeed, this search has sensitivity to LLPs produced via any of the simplified model production modes and (semi)-leptonic decays that give exactly one electron and one muon. On the other hand, models where long-lived particles decay only to either muons or electrons (e.g., \u00b5 \u2192 \u00b5G) are unconstrained by this search. Furthermore, same-sign lepton signatures and signatures with additional leptons are not constrained by the current search but could be covered by extensions of the search [45,198]. Due to the generality of tau-specific models, searches for hadronic tau channels is also desirable. This search has sensitivity to relatively low-mass LLPs; however, the 8 TeV analysis [268] has lower thresholds (p T > 22 GeV on both leptons) albeit with a requirement for shorter decay distances (|d 0 | < 2 cm), and so has superior sensitivity to very low-p T displaced signals.

The DV is formed from opposite-sign leptons, irrespective of flavor, and needs to be located more than 4 mm away from the PV in the transverse plane. DVs in regions with dense detector material are vetoed to suppression backgrounds from converted photons (e.g., \u03b3p \u2192 e + e \u2212 p). This search is in principle sensitive to events with a reconstructed DV mass m DV > 10 GeV, but the high p T requirements for the leptons restrict the sensitivity to low-mass LLPs. ATLAS has also recently released a search for pairs of muons that correspond to a displaced vertex [269]. This search is sensitive to LLP decays that occur sufficiently far from the interaction point that the muons are reconstructed only in the MS. The analysis has four separate trigger pathways: / E T > 110 GeV; one muon with p T > 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.05; two muons with p T 15 GeV and \u2206R \u00b5\u00b5 < 0.5; or three muons with p T > 6 GeV. Thus, the search has sensitivity to final states with high and low masses (down to m \u00b5\u00b5 = 15 GeV), as well as with various lepton multiplicities. Offline selections require the muons to have p T > 10 GeV and opposite charge, and the search is efficient at reconstructing muons for transverse impact parameters up to |d 0 | = 200 cm. Muons are also required to satisfy isolation requirements from jets as well as searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 49 11 For the prompt dark photon search, events are reconstructed at trigger level so that all online reconstructed particles are recorded, while the rest of event information is discarded [270]. The prompt search constrains entirely new territory above 10 GeV.",

Searches for leptonically decaying LLPs typically enjoy low trigger thresholds and good sensitivity to LLP production rates. Extending the success of the leptonic LLP program to future LHC running will necessitate maintaining low-threshold triggers for displaced leptons in a high-luminosity environment; this is a major challenge but one that must be overcome. Another outstanding challenge is coverage of LLP decays to \u03c4 leptons, which lie at the interface between hadronic and leptonic searches. Such decays are very well motivated from the theoretical point of view, as a Higgslike scalar can typically decay about 300 times more often into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 if kinematically allowed, and also one could have large rates into mixed decay modes such as \u03c4 + \u00b5 \u2212 . A displaced hadronic \u03c4 is a striking object, and most likely will have few backgrounds. Hence, limits on exclusive displaced \u03c4s would be of utmost importance 12 .",

The existing ATLAS lepton-jet studies express their results in terms of specific dark photon models 14 , which makes it complicated to apply the results to other models. We refer the reader to Section 6 for a further discussion of this topic. In extending lepton-jet searches, it would be beneficial to have additional searches with a single lepton-jet or low-mass, leptonically-decaying LLP (which are motivated in models with hidden sectors and Majorana neutrinos, for example in Refs. [43,128]). In addition, the status of coverage in the intermediate mass-transition region between \"standard\" displaced lepton pairs and lepton-jets is unclear, and may potentially harbor a gap; adopting the simplified model approach for leptonic LLP decays with masses varying between the GeV and weak scale would ensure comprehensive coverage of low-mass leptonically decaying LLPs. 15 Note that the displaced large transverse impact parameter e\u00b5 CMS search [190] fails to cover this scenario due to the aforementioned lepton veto, which eliminates sensitivity to the tri-lepton signals discussed in Ref. [43], as well as relatively high lepton p T trigger thresholds compared to the kinematics of 4-body W decay. 16 Note that the lepton isolation affects most of the semi-leptonic searches.",

A benchmark LLP model is the heavy neutral lepton (HNL), which corresponds to the charged-current production mode with (semi-)leptonic LLP decays in our simplified model framework. HNLs constitute an important physics case that leads to multi-lepton displaced signatures from W decays, with nice prospects at ATLAS and CMS (see, e.g., Refs. [43,47,48]). While previous searches were not sensitive to this scenario due to either high-p T requirements or the requirement of two DVs in the same event, the presence of a prompt lepton from the W allows the relaxation of these requirements in a dedicated analysis. Moreover, the prospects of triggering on a prompt lepton in such searches was studied recently in Ref. [47] and demonstrated in a prompt search in Ref. [271] 15 . The identification of two leptons from the vertex is a powerful discriminant against backgrounds from metastable particle decays and hadronic interactions in material. This permits a potentially cleaner exploration of the lower HNL mass range (3-6 GeV) than in the semi-leptonic channel (see Section 3.3) despite the lower branching ratio. It should be noted that HNL models can predict LLP decays to all three lepton flavors (either democratically or hierarchically), necessitating the capability to reconstruct displaced leptons of all flavors, including taus.",

Lepton isolation criteria can severely reduce the signal acceptance for a highly-boosted LLP decaying into a lepton and a jet, and they might also veto extra tracks in the events.

            "text": "One of the major gaps in semi-leptonic LLP searches is at the smallest LLP masses. In this case, it can be challenging for the leptons from LLP decays to pass trigger thresholds and/or isolation criteria; backgrounds from heavy-flavor and other processes are also higher for semi-leptonic processes than fully leptonic ones. However, there are very good motivations for low-mass semileptonic LLPs from the HNL benchmark model 18 introduced in Section 3.2.5, which predicts LLPs for HNLs of masses below 30 GeV. The signature of HNLs from W decays with displaced semileptonic HNL decays is an important item on the search agenda of ATLAS, CMS and LHCb [38,43,47,48,277,278]. Recently, there has also been a proposal to search for low-mass HNLs in heavy ion collisions [279]. The semi-leptonic channel has the highest branching ratio (about 50% in the relevant mass range [280]) and can therefore offer the best discovery prospects at LHC experiments for HNL masses up to 30 GeV as long as a DV mass cut of around 6 GeV is made to mitigate backgrounds from B-mesons, m B \u223c 5 GeV, and backgrounds from random-crossings can be suppressed. The lower end of the 6-30 GeV mass range corresponds to a non-perturbative regime for the hadronization of the HNL decay products. As the number of charged hadrons significantly affects the DV reconstruction efficiency, the validation of event generator outputs for this process is an important issue currently being addressed by the community (see e.g., Ref. [47]). The ability of LHCb to trigger directly on the HNL decay products and better reconstruct displaced tracks can in some cases compensate for its lower acceptance and luminosity, as exemplified by a recent search for DVs composed of one muon and several tracks [272,278]; similar searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 55 19 The proposed detector FASER would also have the capability to reconstruct such vertices [290].",

            "text": "There are two ways in which photons coming from LLP decays do not resemble standard photons. First, they cannot be traced back to the PV, thus giving rise to non-pointing photons. Second, they can arrive at the ECAL at a time slightly later than expected because the LLP moves slower than the speed of light; these are referred to as delayed photons. We note that both kinds of unusual photons can be vetoed in searches for photons that originate from the PV, and thus prompt searches typically provide weaker bounds on LLP scenarios than for promptly decaying signals. ATLAS has a search for nonpointing and delayed photons [294] using the full 8 TeV dataset, which supersedes the 7 TeV analysis [295]. In CMS there are studies for delayed photons in the ECAL [296] and for non-pointing photons detected via their conversion to e + e \u2212 pairs [297]. The underlying topology in all these models is the neutralino decay into a gravitino and a photon (\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3G), ubiquitous in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) scenarios [50,298]. Hence all these studies require large / E T in the final state. This corresponds to heavy parent production of LLPs with decays to a single photon and / E T in the simplified model framework; all searches described below use the Snowmass Slopes Point 8 benchmark, which is not straightforward to map to a physical spectrum of heavy parent masses.",

In addition, to guarantee the event comes from a proton-proton collision, a PV with five or more tracks with p T > 0.4 GeV is required. The offline selection requires two photons with E T > 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3, not in the barrel-endcap transition region (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52), at least one of them in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.37) and with less than 4 GeV of energy deposited in the calorimeter in a cone of \u2206R = 0.4 around them (consituting the isolation criterion). In addition, the events are binned in / E T : the / E T < 20 GeV bin contains the prompt backgrounds, the 25 GeV < / E T < 75 GeV bin is used as the control region, and finally the signal analysis is performed in the / E T > 75 GeV bin.

The requirement of large / E T is due to the fact that all of these studies have an underlying theoretical picture of neutralinos decaying into gravitinos and photons, motivated from GMSB scenarios. Hence, these searches do not cover cases without the presence of missing energy, including LLPs that decay to \u03b3\u03b3, l\u03b3 or j\u03b3. It may be possible to extract a constraint on such LLP decay modes due to mismeasurement of jets or the photon decay geometry which could mimic large missing energy; however, this would be sub-optimal compared to a dedicated search. With the exception of the CMS study [296] which requires two additional hard jets, all of these analyses require two displaced photons. A single displaced photon signature can occur in motivated models: it can easily arise, for example, from a very slightly mixed electroweak triplet and singlet as in SUSY theories (see the UV models in Section 2). Furthermore, as discussed in Section 3.1, a single LLP in the detector can also arise for very large lifetimes of neutral LLPs, which limits the reach of current searches at longer lifetimes. In such scenarios, it is possible that the photons from LLP decay can be quite soft, and obtaining ",

First, particles that are massive and/or electrically charged with |Q| = e have a characteristic ionization loss (dE/dx) distinctively different than SM particles. This property can be measured in the tracker. Second, HSCPs are typically heavy and move with a speed less than the speed of light, \u03b2 = v/c < 1. Thus, compared to a particle with \u03b2 \u2248 1, they require a longer time of flight (TOF) to reach the outermost components of the detector (calorimeters and muon chambers). As decays or interactions of the HSCP with the material in the detector can change the electric charge of the HSCP, both CMS and ATLAS perform separate tracker-only and tracker + TOF studies in the language of CMS 20 . The event selection relies on standard single-muon or large-missing-energy triggers. The offline selection relies on identifying the signal events from quality requirements on the tracks using discriminator variables built from track observables. The HSCP search conducted by LHCb [302] is slightly different. Instead of exploiting dE/dx and time of flight, they use the lack of radiation in the ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH). Events are required to pass a high-p T single muon trigger (p T (\u00b5) > 15 GeV). Two opposite sign \"muons\" are then required, each with p T above 50 GeV and an invariant di-muon mass above 100 GeV, to suppress muons coming from DY production, the main background for this search. In addition, particles must have \u03b2 > 0.8, set by the efficiency of the muon chambers to reconstruct slow particles. As electrons and hadrons interact more with the calorimeter than an HSCP, a deposit in the calorimeter of less than 1% of the momentum of the particle is required.",

If it carries a color charge, the default benchmarks correspond to R-hadrons, namely HSCPs that hadronize with SM particles via the strong force, e.g., gluino-gluon or quark-squark states. In the absence of a color charge, the signal is exemplified by long-lived sleptons in the context of gauge-mediated SUSY. Both ATLAS [300] and CMS [4] studies employ these two scenarios, while LHCb [302] uses a stau benchmark model 21 . Finally, CMS also looks for HSCPs coupling only to hypercharge (and hence possessing only couplings to \u03b3 and Z), while ATLAS has a search inspired by electroweakinos 22 At the time of writing there was no public result on a monopole search from CMS. in SUSY: it considers the associated production of a neutral and an electrically charged LLP (chargino-neutralino), and thus only one HSCP plus missing energy are required.

However, milli-charged particles are not covered by these searches and require dedicated detectors (see Section 5.3.3).

Hence, a magnetic monopole behaves as a particle with at least 68.5 electron charges, leading to an unusually large ionization power in matter, so that they would quickly stop in the detector because HIPs lose energy at spectacular rates. Because of the large QED coupling of magnetic monopoles, a perturbative calculation of the cross section is invalid and there is no accurate determination of the production rate, but a na\u00efve Drell-Yan production cross section is provided for the purposes of comparison. The specifics of the detector restrict the sensitivity of this search to magnetic charges g < 2g D because a large fraction of the monopoles stop in the material upstream of the electromagnetic calorimeter, as the latter is used for the L1 trigger [303]. We note that larger magnetic charges can be tested by the MoEDAL experiment [304], which is described in detail in Section 5.3.2.

For other cases, such as mixing with additional particles, the actual splitting can differ more substantially from this 1-loop EW value. 24 If the charged particle could be reconstructed this case is often referred to as a kinked track. However, as the kinked portion has a very large impact parameter, without a serious attempt to capture the kink these tracks, too, simply disappear. 25 While these values set a concrete physics target, we stress again that the mass splitting can be arbitrary in other corners of the BSM parameter space (even within SUSY). For instance,\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd (where the stau and sneutrino masses are free independent parameters) or for scalar particles (e.g., H + \u2192 \u00b5 + H 0 ), where the mass splitting and the overall mass scale are set by arbitrary quartic couplings.",

While at first glance a small mass gap na\u00efvely seems like a hallmark of tuning, near degeneracies often occur naturally as a result of a symmetry. In fact, electroweak symmetry generically leads to small mass splittings between components of a single electroweak multiplet. For example, O (100 MeV) splittings arise between the different components of an electroweak multiplet [57,121] due to EW gauge boson loops 23 . If the SM particle is sufficiently soft it cannot be reconstructed, and then a charged track seems to vanish: this is thus referred to as a disappearing track 24 . The actual lifetime of the charged particle is highly sensitive to the precise value of the mass splitting. For instance, the well studied cases of a fermionic doublet with Y = 1/2 and a fermionic triplet with Y = 0, reminiscent of a Higgsino and Wino in supersymmetry, respectively, have mass splittings of \u2206 = 355 and 166 MeV, up to small corrections, but the corresponding c\u03c4 values differ by almost an order of magnitude: 6.6 mm versus 5.5 cm 25 . This is because the lifetime, c\u03c4, depends on the third power of the mass splitting in these scenarios when the charged LLP decays to a charged pion [57,121].",

This 30 cm value corresponds to four hits at ATLAS, three in the pixel layers plus one in the silicon tracker, and to seven hits in the pixel and trackers of CMS. The search employs a trigger requiring an ISR jet against which the charged particle recoils, along with the presence of large / E T . The disappearing track is reconstructed offline and needs to fulfill quality criteria (isolation, p T threshold, etc.). A phenomenological study [92] has shown that reducing the distance from 30 to 10 cm would give coverage to the elusive Higgsino scenario, moving the expected reach up to 400 GeV, surpassing the expected mono-jet reach of 250 GeV [312][313][314]. Later, ATLAS presented a study [211, 315] using 13 TeV data and exploiting the presence of a new innermost pixel layer (IBL). This addition allows for all four hits to be in the pixel, with the outermost pixel layer now at 12.25 cm, enhancing sensitivity to lower values of c\u03c4. The summary for disappearing tracks at ATLAS for the Wino case can be seen in the left panel of Figure 3.7, while in the right panel we show the constraints for Higgsinos from Ref. [92]. CMS also has a disappearing tracks search using 2015 and 2016 data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV [316].",

Consequently, the experimental signature is little to no signal in the tracker and the ECAL, and large energy deposits in the HCAL. Such a final state with trackless jets also arises in the context of emerging jets [325], and ATLAS has a trigger for trackless jets in association with a soft muon (where the muon is required to fire L1 of the trigger) [249]. Additionally, the CalRatio trigger and associated search for displaced hadronic decays (addressed in Section 3.1) is designed to be sensitive to a similar signature and could provide some coverage of this signature as well. Strictly speaking, SIMPs are not a track-based signature, but we include them here because the interactions of the SIMPs with the tracker are different from usual hadrons in jets, while the calorimeter signatures are similar.",

These so-called SIMPs, for strongly interacting massive particles, are much less considered than their more popular siblings, the WIMPs, but they are regularly considered in the literature in order to address some astrophysical issues. While they are challenged by many observations, again mostly astrophysical, they are not completely excluded. Furthermore, little work has been done on possible constraints from colliders. Extending on previous works, in particular [19], we have studied in more details the possibility of observing trackless jets at the LHC, taking into account realistic simulations of the QCD background and the response of the detectors. Most notably, we show that the charged content of jets is a powerful discriminator to suppress dijet backgrounds at LHC, thus enhancing the sensitivity to a potential SIMP signal. Our analysis shows that SIMPs with mass up to m \u2030 \u2265 400 GeV could lead to an observable signal, provided its interaction cross section with ordinary matter is about 10% of that of ordinary nucleons. Most of our work is dedicated to the forecast for the experimental search of SIMPs at the LHC. To do so, we Figure 3.8: Astrophysical and collider constraints on a simple SIMP setup.

If is larger than an \u00c5but below the mm scale, the individual quirks are not distinguished from one another. However, the pair (which is overall neutral, and therefore does not bend in the magnetic field of the tracker) appears as a single, highly ionizing straight track with missing energy aligned with it, the latter arising from mis-measurement of the track momentum.

This search obtained lower bounds on quirk masses of 107, 119 and 133 GeV for SU (2), SU(3) and SU(5) gauge groups, respectively.

The first study [232] has recast mono-jet and HSCP searches, finding bounds up to 1.7 TeV for colored quirk masses. In addition, it has also proposed using the CMS dataset taken with zero magnetic field. In this dataset, all SM particles are expected to follow a straight trajectory, but the quirks would still bend due to the string tension. The second study [233] has proposed a new algorithm to search for quirks, exploiting the fact that the quirk and anti-quirk pair should lie in the same plane with the highest sensitivity in the \u223c 1-10 mm range. This avoids the necessity of fitting non-helicoidal trajectories, and has the potential to extend the sensitivity to quirks well beyond the current mono-jet and HSCP limits. The third study [328] considers quirks that lose energy through material interactions with the detector. A charged or colored quirk pair can come to a stop within the detector, and annihilate out-of-time with active pp collisions, allowing for sensitivity from stopped particle searches across a wide range of characteristic length scales, \u223c \u00c5 -km range.

ATLAS further supplements the hardware trigger by requiring p T (j) > 50 GeV, |\u03b7| < 1.3 and / E T > 50 GeV, rejecting instrumental noise. In addition, CMS has updated the jet search in Run 2 and also provided a search that triggers on out-of-time muons, both of which use the 13 TeV dataset [228]. The latter also employs the displaced stand-alone (DSA) muon reconstruction algorithm [329]. An offline selection procedure is aimed at reducing the main backgrounds. Muons coming from cosmic rays can be identified due to their distinctive topology. The \"beam halo\" background is the result of protons interacting with residual gas in the beampipe, the beampipe itself, or collimators upstream from the interaction point. Most particles will not travel far before being absorbed by various structures, but muons will travel parallel to the beam and can leave calorimeter deposits out of time with a proton-proton collision. However, these deposits will often be accompanied by corresponding horizontal tracks in the muon systems and can thus be efficiently vetoed. Instrumental noise is rejected in CMS by exploiting the anomalous response in the HCAL.",

HSCP searches are typically more sensitive to any signature with a charged particle, so stopped particle searches are not often expected to be a discovery mode for most simple new physics scenarios with charged LLPs 27 . The typical added value of SP searches is that they can help identify and characterise positive signals in HSCPs, for instance by providing a cleaner extraction of the lifetime and also to properly identify the decay products. However, in some cases (such as for quirks, where HSCP searches are insensitive in much of parameter space), it has been argued that an SP search could actually be a discovery mode if modifications are made to the search strategy to improve sensitivity to quirks [328]. These modifications that would increase quirk acceptance or lower backgrounds include expanding the \u03b7 range, implementing higher energy thresholds, using the timing information, and considering shower evolution in the new CMS endcap calorimeter [330].",

            "text": "Weak decays of SM particles can naturally give rise to displaced vertices at the boosts typically encountered at the LHC. Searches for LLP signatures at sufficiently low LLP mass and lifetime suffer from large backgrounds due to displaced SM decays. One simple example is found in the search for long-lived dark photons decaying to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 at LHCb [262], which drastically loses sensitivity when the dark photon mass gets too close to the K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass, despite the very low \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5 misidentification rate. Moreover, b-hadrons can decay at displacements of a few mm and can be challenging to distinguish from LLPs with masses of a few tens of GeV that decay to a pair of jets. Requiring a large track multiplicity of the displaced vertex and performing a mass fit to the dijet invariant mass can help to significantly reduce the effect of this background (see, for example, Ref. [244,246]). Backgrounds from heavy flavors are typically more abundant in the forward region, as arises, for example, if the signature under study is an LLP from the decay of a SM-like Higgs boson. However, the LHCb forward detector, which was designed to study these SM decays, is, in most cases, capable of rejecting heavy flavor backgrounds more effectively than can be done in ATLAS or CMS. Furthermore, displaced tracks from b-mesons, which usually have impact parameters (d 0 ) of less than 2 mm, can be rejected by using a larger criterion for the minimum track d 0 .",

Beam-gas collisions can be distinguished from long-lived heavy flavor backgrounds and their utilization allows the map to cover precisely the whole VELO geometry, not only the region close to the interaction point. This map was used to veto photon conversions to di-muons, which is the main background affecting displaced dark-photon searches at low mass [262]. In analyses, this material map, together with properties of a reconstructed secondary vertex and its constituent tracks, is used to construct a p-value that is assigned to the hypothesis that the secondary vertex searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 73 originates from a material interaction. As a rule of thumb, LHCb material interaction background is dominant for vertices at a distance from the beam axis larger than 6 mm (where the VELO material begins). Below 6 mm the background is dominated by heavy flavor decays [335]. Because accurate material maps are essential to performing fully reliable sensitivity studies to signatures with displaced vertices, making them publicly available to the broader LLP community is of the highest priority. The availability of such tools in fast parametric simulations such as Delphes [336] would be very useful to reinterpret LLP search results. In Section 6.4.6.2, an example of a reinterpretation of an LLP search is presented, where a rough material veto was performed because these material maps were not publicly available, highlighting the shortcomings of such approaches in the absence of accurate material maps and emphasizing the benefits of making them available.",

These punch-through jets occur especially in regions of reduced total interaction length in the calorimeters (e.g., transition regions between the barrel and the end-caps) and can be suppressed by either rejecting these |\u03b7| regions or requiring a mini-  mal number of hits in the muon system and isolating the displaced vertex from calorimeter jets as well as high-energy tracks and significant track activity in the inner tracking system. In order to not reject true vertices from displaced decays that occur near the end of the calorimeters, the calorimeter-jets veto should only consider jets with a minimum total energy deposit and, e.g., a minimum electromagnetic fraction of the total energy. The track isolation requirement aims at regions with a poor calorimeter measurement (again, transition regions in the calorimeters), where a single highenergy track or the sum of the track activity in a small cone around the displaced vertex could indicate a (punch-through) jet. On the other hand, punch-through jets, given their similarity to signal signatures, can also be used to evaluate systematic uncertainties due to imperfect modeling in the muon-system simulation.",

The rate of cosmic muons in the detector is about 500 Hz at L1, but depending on the HLT path and the offline selection used, the rate of cosmic-ray muons entering a given LLP analysis is generally much less. Cosmic-ray muons are typically an important background source to consider for displaced signatures, especially those with large displacements [227,229,[337][338][339].

Beam halo is produced when protons from the LHC beam scatter off the LHC collimators and produce debris, which can appear in the detector. Beam halo can create energy deposits in the calorimeters or hits in the muon system, both of which would be largely in the beam direction. These energy deposits or muon Figure 4.4: A sketch illustrating the timing differences due to the shorter, more direct path to the calorimeter cells between a beamhalo muon and a particle originating from the collision. The beamhalo muon is detected earlier than the particle from the collision. system hits would appear earlier than if they had been made from particles coming from the collision (see Figure 4.4). Beam halo is usually not modelled in MC simulation, since it is highly dependent on the beam parameters.",

            "text": "LLP searches often have very low backgrounds, as opposed to searches for prompt particles. This makes LLP searches highly sensitive to signals of new physics. There are, however, a few common sources of background that arise in different LLP searches: other, known, long-lived particles such as b-hadrons; real particles produced in the detector, such as particles produced in collisions that interact with the nuclei of the detector material; real particles produced outside the detector, such as cosmic muons or beam halo; fake particles, such as detector noise; and algorithmically induced fakes, such as two tracks that cross and are reconstructed as a displaced vertex, as described above. These backgrounds are generally atypical, difficult to model in simulation, and challenging to estimate. Thus, the possible appearance of unexpected background sources should be taken into account in any new LLP search, and the development of novel techniques and methods to estimate them is encouraged.

            "text": "The experimental searches for LLPs outlined in Chapter 3 are limited by the abilities of the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments to trigger on and reconstruct the objects that are associated with each signature. In the Phase 2 high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), the extremely high pile-up conditions necessitate the upgrade of all three detectors to maintain triggers at thresholds needed for sensitivity to electroweak, Higgs, and BSM physics (see Refs. [340,341] for an overview); to reject particles originating from pile-up vertices; and to maintain object reconstruction in the highluminosity environment. These upgrades include the addition of tracking layers to the forward regions of ATLAS and CMS, improvements to timing reconstruction in events, and the inclusion of tracking information at earlier stages of the trigger (or, in the case of LHCb, the full online reconstruction of every event). While these upgrades are crucial to the success of the HL-LHC physics goals for conventional searches (such as for electroweak, Higgs, or SUSY signatures), they have the opportunity to be transformative for searches for LLPs. Signatures involving LLPs are often subject to small-to-negligible irreducible backgrounds, and improvements to the reconstruction, timing, and vertexing of displaced objects can typically suppress any instrumental or fake backgrounds. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of sources of backgrounds for LLP searches.) At the same time, the introduction of tracking information to earlier stages of the trigger could be used to trigger on events that may contain hadronically decaying LLPs that must otherwise pass jet triggers, leading to an improvement in sensitivity to low-mass LLPs. Indeed, many of the gaps in coverage from current searches identified in Section 3.6 can be closed or reduced using the new technology from detector upgrades. Even more uniquely, LLP signatures may themselves motivate the introduction of new detector elements that are dedicated to exploring new lifetime frontiers in particle physics.",

The MDT chambers will be integrated into the L0 trigger in order to sharpen the momentum threshold. Some of the MDT chambers in the inner barrel layer will be replaced with new, small-diameter MDTs. Additional RPC chambers will be installed in the inner barrel layer to increase the acceptance and robustness of the trigger, and some chambers in high-rate regions will be refurbished. New TGC triplet searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 87 chambers in the barrel-endcap transition region will replace the current TGC doublets to suppress the high trigger rate from random coincidences in this region. The electronics of all the subdetectors will need to be replaced due to obsolescence, aging, and radiation damage. During the Phase 1 upgrade (to take place from 2019 to 2021) the New Small Wheel (NSW) chambers will replace the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) and the MDT chambers of the innermost endcap wheel by Micromegas and small-strip TGCs. The replacement of the MDT front-end readout will address the trigger rate and latency requirements of the TDAQ system in Phase 2 and allow the use of MDT hit information to improve the muon p T resolution in the L0 trigger. Additionally, in the upgraded detector all data from the barrel and endcap detectors will be transmitted to FPGAs at L0, which can be used to implement more advanced and flexible algorithms for muon reconstruction, including the use of neural networks and/or dedicated tracking for non-pointing muons [348]. Some LLP scenarios (e.g., Hidden Valley models [59]) predict muon-jet final states, which result in collimated muons that are not identified with high efficiency by the current triggers (see Section 3.2). In Figure 5.1, the opening angle between muons in a Hidden Valley model is shown, for a particular combination of particle masses and parameters. The di-muon separation is much smaller than the current system can resolve (approximately 0.2 in \u2206\u03c6(\u00b5, \u00b5)). In the no-upgrade scenario, these can only be recorded by the single muon trigger.

The Pixel Detector adds significantly to the lever-arm for measuring the transverse particle momentum pT from the curvature of the track. The resolutions of these parameters directly determine the performance of the detector in terms of its capability for b-tagging and lepton or jet reconstruction. The resolutions for these parameters are obtained from simulation by comparing their reconstructed values for a given particle with the truth value. The tracks used to calculate the resolution are required to pass the same selection criterion as for the efficiency calculation. Tracks must be matched to a truth particle with P match > 0.5. The resolutions on the track parameters are obtained from the RMS of the core of the distribution of the difference between the reconstructed and true values of the parameters.    the longitudinal impact parameter for single muons with various p T values is shown as a function of the pseudorapidity both with the current detector and projections for after the HL-LHC upgrade using digital clustering to find the tracks. The improvement is even more marked with analogue clustering: the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolutions are shown for different pixel pitches in Figure 5.8.",

The smuon pair production has the advantage that it can be characterized by a very clean final state topology, and we will therefore focus on the process qq \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b5, where the two smuons decay far from the primary interaction vertex.

Figure 5.13 (right) compares the number of hits created by these displaced muons in the CMS muon system in Phase 2 and the current CMS detector.

If the match is unsuccessful and the muon is not vetoed by L1 tracks, the non-prompt L1 muon p T is used to form a displaced muon candidate.

Further improvements to the algorithm are underway to accommodate high pile-up conditions. The upgrade of the RPC system will allow slowly-moving particles to pass the trigger and be identified by measuring their time of flight to each RPC station with a resolution of O(1) ns. The speed of muon-like particles and the time (bunch crossing) of their origin will be computed with a fast algorithm to be implemented in the L1 trigger for the HL-LHC.",

The events were generated with Pythia 8 [212], exploring neutralino lifetimes (c\u03c4) in the range 0.1-300 cm. The values of the \u039b scale parameter were considered in the range 100-500 TeV, which is relevant for this model to be consistent with the observation of a 125 GeV Higgs boson. After requiring the neutralino to decay within the CMS ECAL acceptance and the photon energy being above a \"trigger-like\" threshold, the generator-level photon time of flight was smeared according to the expected experimental resolutions. A cutoff at a photon time greater than 3\u03c3 of the timing resolution is applied and the \"signal region\" is assumed to be background free to estimate the sensitivity. The signal efficiency of such a requirement is computed and translated, assuming the theoretical cross sections provided in Ref. [59], to an upper limit, at 95% C.L., on the production cross section of the\u03c7 1 0 \u2192G + \u03b3 process. In Figure 5.19 (right), the analysis sensitivity in terms of the \u039b scale (and therefore of the neutralino mass) and lifetime is shown for three different assumptions on the timing resolution. The 300 ps resolution is representative of the time-of-flight resolution (TOF) consistent with current CMS detector performance. The 180 ps resolution is representative of the TOF resolution of the upgraded CMS detector without the MTD, in which case the TOF measurement will be dominated by the time spread of the luminous region. The vertex timing provided by the MTD detector will bring the TOF resolution to about 30 ps. As visible in the figure, a full-scope upgrade of the CMS detector with photon and track timing will provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity at short lifetimes and high masses, even with the first 300 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity.",

Such particles are predicted by many well-motivated supersymmetric models such as anomaly-mediated SUSY-breaking scenarios, where the supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model W bosons, the wino fermions, are the lightest SUSY state. In such models, the lightest neutralino and chargino can be nearly massdegenerate, with a mass splitting around 160 MeV, and the chargino is consequently long lived. The combination of long lifetime and boost when produced in a high-energy collider allows the chargino to leave multiple hits in the traversed tracking layers before decaying. When performing searches for such signatures in ATLAS, selected events are typically required to contain at least one short track, hereafter called a tracklet. To study how such searches can be improved with the ITk upgrade, some assumptions have been made for simulating events and projected detector response. The detector response is parametrised by using response functions based on studies performed with Geant4 simulations of the upgraded detector in high-luminosity pile-up conditions.",

The long-lived gluino hadronises into an R-hadron, which decays into a GeV neutralino and hadrons. A dedicated reconstruction algorithm is currently used in n 2 to recover efficiency for reconstructing such displaced particles. As such algorithms e not yet been optimised for the ITk, this study assumes that the achievements of the n 2 algorithm can be reproduced, given that the necessary hits are present. In Refere [66], it is shown that for particles which leave at least seven hits in silicon layers 5 of Run 2 ID, the reconstruction efficiency is nearly 100%. For photon conversions, the restruction efficiency for secondary particles was studied for the ITk using a dedicated ck reconstruction (see Section 3.2.1). e probability of producing at least seven silicon hits in the ITk geometry is tested with implified simulation which has a description of the ITk active sensors and a modelling the magnetic field.

The probability of producing at least seven silicon hits in the ITk geometry is shown in Figure fig:atlas-tdr-030-fig3-41 for a 2 TeV R-hadron with \u03c4 = 1 ns. The increased volume and number of ITk layers leads to improved efficiency for the reconstruction of tracks from displaced vertices (and hence the vertices themselves) out to radial distances of up to 550 mm.

A theory study has been done in Ref. [357] examining potential gains in sensitivity for hadronic displaced vertex reconstruction using timing information. A new trigger strategy for a delayed jet is studied by comparing the prompt jet with p T > 30 GeV that reconstructs the four-dimensional primary vertex (PV4d) with the arrival time of another jet at the timing layer. The delayed and displaced jet signal, after requiring a minimal decay transverse distance of 0.2 m (L T 1 ), will typically not have good tracks associated with it. Consequently, the major SM background is from trackless jets. The origins of this background can be classified into two categories: hard collision from a same vertex (SV), and pile-up (PU) from different vertices. Other types of background such as cosmic rays, beam halo, material interactions, etc, are out-of-time and will become important after most of the hard collision background is removed using selections based on reconstructing vertices and timing delay. Out-of-time backgrounds may have other distinctive features that would allow their effective suppression. While the study in Ref. [357] can serve as an optimistic inspiration for increasing LLP sensitivity with timing information, detailed experimental studies are needed to determine the actual sensitivity gain.",

This study considers all-hadronic final states with low H T , taking SM Higgs boson decays into four jets as an example. Theoretical motivation to look for such decays is very strong; see Section 2.2 for a detailed discussion. In particular, there is currently a blind spot for lifetimes of order 1 cm in searches for new long-lived scalars in Higgs decays, i.e. h \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6. The goal is to probe very small branching fractions of the Higgs boson, so for this study, BR[h \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 \u2192 4q] = 10 \u22125 is assumed. For prompt decays, the background is overwhelming, but if the \u03c6 has c\u03c4 of a few mm, the offline analysis has very low backgrounds. The problem is getting such events on tape, in particular through L1. This toy study estimates how an off-pointing track reconstruction at L1 can help. To estimate the efficacy of the approach, the resulting projections are compared with the best alternatives in the absence of an offpointing track trigger, by using associated Higgs boson production with a W boson that decays leptonically to pass a lepton trigger, or considering L1 calorimeter jets with no associated prompt tracks.",

This enhanced design is feasible without greatly altering the track finding approach, but will require more FPGA computational power than the current proposal, which only considers only prompt tracks. Tracks passing the selection are clustered using the same algorithm as described above, and clusters containing tracks with high impact parameters are flagged as displaced jets. Though the baseline design of the L1 Track Trigger currently is optimized to find prompt tracks, these studies show that an enhanced L1 Track Trigger can extend the L1 trigger acceptance to include new BSM physics signals. For now, the extended L1 track reconstruction is limited to the barrel region. In order to compare the results with prompt and extended track reconstruction, one needs to make a correction for the rapidity coverage: prompt tracks are found in |\u03b7| < 2.4, while the extended track algorithm currently only reconstructs tracks in |\u03b7| < 1.0. To scale the efficiency for finding track jets to the full |\u03b7| < 2.4 range, a scale factor based on efficiency in the full \u03b7 range and the central \u03b7 range was used. The scale factor was comparable to the increase in L1 rate.

It is therefore important to perform the same LLP search projections for both experiments to compare performance and evaluate the complementarity of the two experiments. For example, both experiments explore the idea of a fast timing detector at HL-LHC. The CMS MTD aims for full-coverage of a barrel layer plus endcap disks, while the ATLAS HGTD plans for multiple layers of endcaps. How the different \u03b7 coverage of the timing layer might impact LLP searches will be an interesting question to answer. In the case of calorimetry, the ATLAS LAr electromagnetic calorimeter is segmented in z, providing the additional pointing capability to find displaced photons. On the other hand, the CMS ECAL electronics upgrade in the barrel, and HG-CAL upgrade in the endcaps, will considerably improve its timing resolution to identify photons that are out-of-time.

Low p T particles will have even more discrimination power since their paths leave longer times between hits in consecutive layers of the tracker.",

The CMS MTD is located between the tracker and the ECAL with a distance to the beamline of about 1.2 m. If one imagines a fast timing layer outside the ATLAS muon system (MS) with a distance of approximately 10 m [357], timing information at such distances could provide additional discriminating power for particles with longer lifetimes. In Figure 5.27, the projection with a 30 ps timing resolution of such a hypothetical detector outside the ATLAS muon system is plotted in a thick solid line. A less-precise timing resolution (150 ps) has been also considered with a selection \u2206t > 1 ns to suppress background. While this study is optimistic in assuming that selections on timing can eliminate all backgrounds to the LLP search, it nevertheless serves as important inspiration for more detailed experimental studies to understand the actual extent of the sensitivity gain. The LLP efficiency is largely unaffected by this change, while low-mass LLPs lose sensitivity by a factor of a few.",

Moreover, if such a layer can be designed with searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 123 double-sided modules, similar to the CMS outer tracker approach for the HL-LHC, hit pairs (stubs) from this layer can be used in a L1 track trigger for displaced tracks or disappearing tracks. The feasibility of such an approach would depend on the ability to store and process data at a rate not allowed by current technology.

As such, it is naturally suited for the search of BSM longlived particles in a mass and lifetime range comparable to these hadrons. It is the only LHC experiment to be fully instrumented in the forward region 2 < \u03b7 < 5, where b-and c-hadrons are abundantly produced and their decay length is enhanced due to the large longitudinal boost. In this region, detector occupancy is extremely high and thus the LHCb experiment has been run at reduced luminosity compared to ATLAS and CMS during Runs 1 and 2. However, an upgrade of the detector is planned to allow running at a luminosity of 2 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in LHC Run 3 (starting in 2020) while maintaining or improving the current physics performance [367]. This is five times larger than the luminosity during Runs 1 and 2. This first upgrade phase (Phase 1a) will entail a novel trigger paradigm where all sub-detectors are fast enough to be read out in real time and the first trigger decisions are done in software. This trigger scheme is flexible and offers a great opportunity for searches of striking signatures like those of BSM long-lived particles. This upgrade comes earlier than the planned ATLAS and CMS upgrades for the HL-LHC phase which are planned to be installed during LHC long shutdown 3 (by 2025). In this shutdown, LHCb plans to consolidate and modestly enhance the Phase 1a upgrade detector (Phase 1b), while a Phase 2 upgrade to run at an even higher luminosity up to \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is planned to be installed later, during long shutdown 4 (by 2030) [368].

The LHCb detector needs to be upgraded to cope with the higher radiation dose and, most importantly, to avoid the saturation of the trigger rate and exploit the higher luminosity. The main bottleneck in the current trigger is in the first stage, which reduces the accepted rate from 30 MHz to 1 MHz at hardware level. For the upgrade, the hardware trigger will be removed and the full event will be read out at the bunch crossing rate of the LHC (40 MHz), with a flexible software-based trigger. In Table 5.1 the current and upgraded conditions of the detector are summarised. To cope with the larger occupancy and higher rate of the upgraded detector, the electronics of all of the sub-detectors must be upgraded, and some sub-detectors must be fully replaced. For example, the tracking system, which plays a crucial role in LLP searches, must be replaced. The upgraded tracking system consists of the VErtex LOcator (VELO), surrounding the interaction point, the Upstream Tracker, a tracking station placed before the magnet, and the Scintillating Fibers tracker (SciFi), three stations after the magnet. In the VELO [369], the current strips will be replaced by pixel detectors, with a custom developed ASIC (VeloPix) able to cope with a maximum hit rate of 900 Mhits/s/ASIC. The Upstream Tracker [370] is composed of four silicon micro-strip planes, with finer granularity and larger acceptance compared to the current tracker. Each station of the SciFi has four planes of 2.5 m long scintillating fibres read out by silicon photo-multipliers.",

This was made possible by the design of a new dedicated trigger output called Turbo Stream. The event record is written directly from the trigger and processed so that it can be used for physics analysis without the need for offline reconstruction [270]. Several variations of Turbo have been introduced in the last several years. For 2015 data taking, the first version of Turbo allowed only the triggered signal candidate objects to be saved, without keeping the rest of the event and thereby discarding all sub-detector information. While the event size was an order of magnitude smaller than for full stream data, any analysis relying on additional information from the surrounding event could not use Turbo Stream data. For this reason, full event reconstruction was implemented as Turbo++ in 2016. Finally, a new intermediate solution between Turbo and Turbo++ called Turbo SP (Selective Persistence) was implemented in 2017. With Turbo SP, both the trigger candidate objects and a subset of the other objects in the event are saved. This flexible solution allows the analyzer to choose which objects to save, minimizing the size of the stored event. Once the trigger is upgraded to run purely at the software level, the large majority of LHCb analyses will be moved to Turbo. The reduced event size allows the storage of particle candidates at a high rate, fully exploiting the reduction in p T thresholds due to the removal of the L0 hardware trigger.",

A displaced di-muon signature also appears in some Hidden Valley (HV) scenarios [59], in which a hidden sector with strong dynamics showers and hadronizes into dark mesons that can have an appreciable decay rate to leptons.

The selection efficiency should also be significantly higher due to the prospects for online displaced vertex identification. The main focus of LHCb will be to probe the region at small lifetime where it has already proven to be the most competitive (see discussion in Section 3). The background from QCD and material interactions is the main limiting factor, and the improved vertex resolution of the upgraded VELO together with the lower material budget and the use of a detailed material map are expected to bring large improvements in the upgraded detector.",

Furthermore, a dedicated software trigger looking for a large number of displaced vertices in the VELO and soft p T requirements could in principle improve the sensitivity to this kind of models, but studies are needed to fully understand its potential and compare LHCb to other experiments.",

[377] have investigated the prospects of using more or less inclusive reconstruction of the two D meson decays at the upgraded LHCb. A similar approach could be used to target decays to bb that hadronize to B mesons since the latter is likely to produce D mesons in its decay. Since LHCb is designed to reconstruct heavy flavor decays, it can be competitive in this kind of search [377] (see Figure 5.37).

Namely, for LLP candidates decaying below 5 mm from the beam line, the main source of background is due to heavy flavour decays, while material interactions with the RF-foil compose the main background contribution for LLPs decaying above 5 mm from the beam line. While the former is purely due to QCD processes and hence not reducible, the latter is kept under control by the use of a detailed veto map (see Ref. [262]). However, the ideal case would be to completely remove the RF-foil during the Phase 2 upgrade [378], which would result in a large reduction of the background component due to material interactions. The improvements foreseen to the Phase 2 VELO (probably based on an updated version of the Phase 1 VELO), are expected to increase the sensitivity to shorter lifetimes and better primary vertex and impact parameter resolution (see Figure 5.38). Unfortunately, the removal of the RF-foil requires the development of new techniques to isolate the sensors from the beam radio frequency and is not necessarily seen as a viable option. Therefore, improving the material veto maps as much as possible by accurately modeling the material interactions would be desirable as a more realistic option for the HL-LHC era.",

This has led to new proposals for dedicated experiments to look for LLPs in new regimes that are otherwise inaccessible at the LHC. These experiments provide the best sensitivity to new millicharged LLPs, magnetic monopoles, and other LLPs arising from models such as those containing Higgs-portal hidden sectors, dark photons, and Majorana neutrinos. As discussed in Section 2.2, LLPs beyond the Standard Model are theoretically well motivated and come in wide range of masses and lifetimes. ATLAS and CMS have excellent sensitivity for fairly high mass LLPs, regardless of their lifetime (see, e.g., Refs. [4,239,380,381]). Low mass and/or softer final states are more challenging due to both background and triggering limitations. In the short-lifetime regime, for c\u03c4 of the scale of the VELO, LHCb has sensitivity to somewhat lower masses and can trigger on softer muonic final states, generating complementary reach provided the LLP has a significant branching ratio to muons [246,247,272,302,382]. Finally, the low-mass/soft final states with rather long lifetimes are challenging for all three experiments. These signatures can be covered partially by NA62 [383] operating in beam dump 3 For general information on the MoEDAL experiment, see: http: //moedal.web.cern.ch/.",

A schematic view of the MoEDAL experiment is shown in Figure 5.40. It is a unique and largely passive detector comprising different detector technologies. The main sub-detector system is made of a large array of CR-39, Makrofol\u00ae and Lexan TM nuclear track detector (NTD) stacks surrounding the intersection area. The passage of a HI particle through the plastic detector is marked by an invisible damage zone along the trajectory. The damage zone is revealed as a cone-shaped etchpit when the plastic detector is chemically etched. Then the sheets of plastics are scanned looking for aligned etch pits in multiple sheets. The MoEDAL NTDs have a threshold of z/\u03b2 \u223c 5, where z is the charge and \u03b2 = v/c the velocity of the incident particle.",

A unique feature of the MoEDAL detector is the use of paramagnetic magnetic-monopole trappers (MMTs) to capture magneticallycharged HI particles. The high magnetic charge of a monopolebeing at least one Dirac charge g D = 68.5e -implies a strong magnetic dipole moment, which may result in strong binding of the monopole with the nuclei of the aluminium MMTs. In such a case, the presence of a trapped monopole would de detected through the induction technique by measuring the persistent current, defined as the difference between the superconducting magnetometer currents before and after the passage of the MMT bar through the sensing coil [388,389].",

Monopolium is a neutral state, difficult to detect directly at a collider detector, although its decay into two photons would give a rather clear signal for ATLAS and CMS [415]. Nevertheless the LHC radiation detector systems can be used to detect final-state protons pp \u2192 pX p exiting the LHC beam vacuum chamber at locations determined by their fractional momentum losses [416].

The ATLAS bounds are better that the MoEDAL ones for |g| = 1g D due to the higher luminosity delivered in ATLAS and the loss of acceptance in MoEDAL for small magnetic charges. On the other hand, higher charges are difficult to be probed in ATLAS due to the limitations of the level-1 trigger deployed for such searches. Limits on production cross sections of singly-charged magnetic monopoles set by various colliders are presented in Refs.

The purpose of the detector is to search for particles with fractional charge as small as one-thousandth the charge of an electron. This detector would also be sensitive to neutral particles from new physics scenarios via their interaction or decay in flight in the \u223c 10 m decay zone in front of the detector or in the detector itself. The isolation of the detector means that the huge background from SM processes in the main detectors is largely absent.

In this case MoEDAL trapping volumes, after they have been scanned through the ETH Zurich SQUID facility to identify any trapped monopole will be shipped to a remote underground facility to be monitored for the decay of pseudo-stable massive charged particles that may also have become trapped. MALL is the detector that monitors MoEDAL trapping volumes for decays of captured particles. It is envisaged that MALL will be installed deep underground at SNOLAB in Canada where cosmic backgrounds are minimised to one muon per 0.27 m 2 /day. Background is further reduced by the ability to determine if a detected track originated within the monitored volume and also by energy cuts on deposited signals. A schematic view of the detector is shown in Figure 5.43. Initial estimates indicate that lifetimes up to around 10 years can be probed. The MALL detector is designed to be sensitive to charged particles and to photons, with energy as small as 1 GeV. It is envisaged that construction of the detector will begin after the MAPP detector is full deployed. The possibility of analysing decommissioned parts of the LHC searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 141 beam-pipe system at the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb/MoEDAL sites with a SQUID to search for trapped magnetic monopoles has been proposed [430]. In this context the MoEDAL experiment may serve as a formal platform for coordinating machining, scanning and analysis work, in collaboration with interested ATLAS, CMS and LHCb members. The induction technique has been successfully employed at the LHC with the dedicated MoEDAL trapping detector. Additional searches for trapped monopoles in beam pipe material would access wide windows of magnetic charges and production cross sections to which other LHC experiments are insensitive. The decommissioned central beryllium beam pipe sections of ATLAS and CMS, with a 4\u03c0 coverage and exposure to the highest rates of 7 and 8 TeV pp collisions, are by far the most attractive samples to be analysed. The analysis on the CMS beam pipe is expected to be carried out in 2019.",

The effects of multiple scattering and energy loss are included using a simplified model of the CMS detector material budget and a region of rock spanning 17 m between the CMS experimental cavern and the proposed experimental site. The number of expected mCP particles per fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity incident at the detector is computed as a function of the mass of the milli-charged particle. The signal efficiency is then estimated after processing the calculated particles as they would emerge from the interaction point through a full Geant4 simulation of the detector; this is necessary because the small charge regime is sensitive to details such as the reflectivity, the light attenuation length, and the shape of the scintillator. These details, as well as the quantum efficiency, light-emission spectrum and the fast-time constants were modeled in Geant4 using the specifications provided by the manufacturers for the scintillator and PMTs. Combining the estimated background rates discussed above with the cross sections, acceptances and efficiencies calculated for all masses and electric charges, the sensitivity projections of the milliQan experiment for LHC and HL-LHC are shown in Figure 5.45.  A 1/100th scale \"demonstrator\" of milliQan to validate the detector concept was installed in the PX56 location at CERN during Technical Stop 2 of 2017 and was upgraded during the 2017-2018 year-end technical stop. This demonstrator, shown in Figure 5.46, has been recording data since its installation, and expects to have first results later this year. If funding is secured, construction of the full milliQan apparatus is planned for 2019, with installation in the tunnel in 2020. ",

The current MATHUSLA design employs proven and relatively cheap technologies to allow for MATHUSLA's construction in time for the HL-LHC upgrade. Therefore, the trackers are envisioned to be implemented with Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), which have been used for very large area experiments in the past [434,435], while plastic scintillators provide the surrounding veto. This minimal design has been shown to be capable of measuring the LLP boost on an event-by-event basis [436] using the geometry of the LLP visible decay products. Final-state multiplicity provides a straightforward discriminant between hadronic and electromagnetic decays. Additional particle identification capability, as well as detection of final-state photons, might be possible by inserting an additional material layer between tracking layers to induce an electromagnetic shower that can be used to distinguish electrons, photons and muons.",

In Figure 5.47 is shown, schematically, the two main MATHUSLA signals, LLPs decaying into at least two charged leptons, or into jets that contain O(10) charged hadrons [436]. In 50-90% of leptonic decays and practically 100% of hadronic decays [436], two or more charged partices hit the ceiling due to the LLP boost and are recorded by the tracker. The charged particle trajectories can be fitted to reconstruct a DV. Unlike most analyses in the main detectors, these DVs must satisfy the additional stringent requirement that all trajectories coincide in time at the DV. The scintillator is used as a veto to ensure that the charged particles originate at the DV: there can be no hits along the line between the vertex and the LHC main interaction point (IP), nor along the lines obtained by extrapolating the individual charged particle trajectories backwards. These exhaustive geometric and timing requirements make it extremely difficult for backgrounds to fake the LLP signal. Cosmic rays can be rejected since they travel in the wrong direction (as well as occurring mostly in cosmic ray showers with extremely highly correlated particle multiplicity in the detector). Muons from the LHC collision do not satisfy the DV signal requirement. The rare occasions in which muons scatter inside the decay volume can be vetoed with the scintillators. Finally, neutrinos from cosmic rays and LHC collisions can scatter in the decay volume and produce displaced vertices, but those can also be rejected with geometric and timing requirements. We refer the reader to Ref. [96] for more details. More comprehensive studies of these backgrounds and their rejection strategies, including full simulations, are currently in progress.

The sensitivity of MATHUSLA is roughly proportional to the decay volume (which scales with surface area) and roughly independent of the precise geometry or location of the detector, as long as it is O(100 m) horizontally displaced from the IP. Therefore, a detector with smaller or larger volume than the benchmark in Figure 5.47 may be implemented, depending on available space and budget. Furthermore, the detector volume can be divided into smaller, independent modules (which cooperate for triggering purposes). These can be massproduced economically and arranged according to the requirements of the experimental site. Such a modular construction also allows for a natural way to improve or extend the physics program of the experiment in an efficient way, by eventually upgrading, for example, one or a few modules with additional capabilities, such as higher tracking resolution for reconstruction of very low-mass LLPs below 10 MeV, or an additional material layer between the trackers for particle ID.",

A detector volume of \u223c 10 6 m 3 gives sensitivity to LLPs near the BBN lifetime limit if they are produced with \u223c pb cross section. This improves LLP sensitivity, compared to the main detectors alone, by several orders of magnitude for many LLP scenarios. The detector is simple and relies on proven technology, making its construction in time for the HL-LHC upgrade feasible. Once constructed, MATHUSLA could function without modification as a detector for the HE-LHC (with increased sensitivity). A small-scale test stand detector is already taking data at CERN, and studies are underway to finalize a detailed design for the full-scale detector.",

This space is presently occupied by the LHCb data acquisition (DAQ) system, but will become available before Run 3 once the DAQ system is relocated to the surface. The layout of the cavern is shown in Figure 5.49, with the location of CODEX-b overlaid. The nominal CODEX-b configuration features a 10\u00d710\u00d710-m volume instrumented with RPC tracking layers or other off-the-shelf tracking technology, as well as roughly 25 interaction lengths of shielding near IP8 -e.g., 4.5 m of Pb -to suppress primary and secondary K L , neutron, and other hadronic backgrounds. This shield requires an active muon veto with an efficiency of O(10 \u22125 ), in order to reject backgrounds induced by muons or other charged particles in the downstream parts of the shield. The veto is located several metres within the shield such that backgrounds induced by neutral particles remain suppressed. See Ref. [97] for a study of a proof-of-concept example detector layout and corresponding tracking efficiency, as well as a detailed study of the backgrounds. More ambitious technologies, including calorimetry, precision time-of-flight measurements, or integration into the LHCb readout may also be feasible.

Due to their weak coupling to the SM, such particles are typically long lived and travel a macroscopic distance before decaying back into SM particles. Moreover, such particles may be highly collimated. For example, new particles that are produced in pion (B-meson) decays are typically produced within angles of \u03b8 \u223c \u039b QCD /E (m B /E) off the beam-collision axis, where E is the energy of the particle.

(A symmetric location on the other side of ATLAS in tunnel TI18 is also possible.) This tunnel was formerly used to connect the SPS to the LEP tunnel, but is currently empty and unused. As shown on the tunnel map in the lower left panel of Figure 5.52, the beam collision axis passes through TI12 close to where it merges with the main LHC tunnel. A more detailed study of the intersection between the beam collision axis and TI12 verifies that there exists space for FASER in the tunnel, as shown in the lower-right panel of Figure 5.52.",

When LLPs are produced in the very-forward region of the beam collision axis, they typically have very high energies E \u223c TeV. Although the identity of the LLP decay products depends on the mass of the LLP and the concrete new-physics model, some of the standard, characteristic LLP decay signatures are generically expected, such as two or more stable charged particles, such as electrons, muons or pions. This leads to a striking signature at FASER: two oppositely charged tracks with very high energy that emanate from a vertex inside the detector and which have a combined momentum that points back to the IP. A measurement of individual tracks with sufficient resolution and an identification of their charges is therefore imperative if the apparatus is to make use of kinematic features to distinguish signal from background. A tracking-based technology, supplemented by a magnet and a calorimeter to allow for energy measurements, will be the key components of FASER. Details of the detector design can be found in the Letter of Intent [459] and Technical Proposal [461]. The FASER signals consist of two extremely energetic (\u223cTeV) coincident tracks or photons starting at a common vertex and pointing back to the ATLAS IP. Muons and neutrinos are the only known particles that can transport such energies through 100 m of rock and concrete between the IP and FASER. The CERN Sources, Targets, and Interactions (STI) group has computed the fluxes of muons and neutrinos at the FASER location using a FLUKA simulation [463][464][465]. These muon fluxes then allow one to estimate the rate and energy spectrum of muon-associated radiative processes near the detector. Preliminary estimates show that muon-associated radiative processes and neutrino-induced backgrounds may be reduced to negligible levels [461].",

The physics reach at FASER and FASER 2 for these models is shown in Figure 5.53. Here we assume that backgrounds can be reduced to negligible levels.

The coverage of a full model can, however, be severely limited by the kind of simplified-model results available, as discussed recently in Ref. [99] for the case of the phenomenological MSSM. Indeed, for some models the large number of relevant simplifiedmodel topologies and their complexity can make the simplifiedmodel approach inexpedient.

These tools allow the user to reproduce experimental analyses by means of MC event simulation coupled to an approximate emulation of detector effects. 3 For the latter, CheckMATE and MadAnalysis5 rely on Delphes [336], in some cases supplemented with appropriate tuning, while Rivet and ColliderBit employ object smearing and analysis-specific reconstruction efficiencies. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations are helping these recasting efforts by providing more and more detailed information about their analyses and results. As an example, covariance matrices for the background correlations in the framework of simplified likelihoods were provided for the analysis of Ref. [490]. The situation is, so far, quite different for LLP searches. First, the presentation of results in terms of simplified models is still limited to a few topologies and does not always include all of the parameters required for a general purpose reinterpretation. It is worth noting that, compared with simplified models for prompt searches, simplified models for LLP searches always have at least one additional free model parameter: the lifetime of the LLP. Second, recasting LLP searches outside of the experimental collaborations is a difficult task since the searches are very sensitive to the detector response, which in most cases cannot be easily emulated by a fast detector simulation (and many backgrounds are also challenging to simulate due to their non-standard nature; see Chapter 4 for a full discussion of backgrounds to LLP searches). As a result, while first steps towards the treatment of LLPs were achieved in SMod-elS [491] and MadAnalysis5 [492], the implementation of LLP searches in public recasting tools is still in its infancy, thus limiting the applicability of the experimental results.",

To this end, we first discuss in Section 6.2 the various options for presenting the LLP results (and for a summary, see Figure 6.1), and compare their advantages and shortcomings. In Section 6.3, we discuss in more details how the simplified models defined in Section 2 can be used to reinterpret LLP searches. In Section 6.4, we present several attempts at recasting LLP searches, according to the LLP signature, focusing on heavy stable charged particles and various displaced objects. For each case, we elaborate on the lessons learned from the reinterpretation effort. Section 6.5 presents a first attempt to extend the public detector simulator Delphes to deal with LLP searches, while Section 6.6 focuses on reinterpretations performed within the experiments themselves, including the RE-CAST framework [494]. In Section 6.7, we discuss complementary constraints on LLPs from reinterpreting prompt searches. We conclude in Section 6.8 with our recommendations for the presentation of LLP results.",

Also, when re-using simplified-model results one avoids detector simulation uncertainties. The disadvantages are that the simplifiedmodel result cannot be applied to other LLP production or decay modes, resulting in overly conservative limits if the LLP signal is composed from multiple topologies. This can be important if the LLP is a color singlet, but there are several heavier color-charged states which can be produced and decay to the LLP. In principle this can be overcome if efficiencies are provided for a sufficiently 6 These points are illustrated by the reinterpretation of the CMS search for heavy stable charged particles [493] discussed in Section 6.3: for the specific model considered in Ref. [90], constraints obtained using only a single simplified model (direct production of\u03c4s in this case) can underestimate the bounds on the LLP mass by almost a factor of two. large number of simplified models (including cascade decays), as a function of the simplified-model parameters, which should include the LLP lifetime. These efficiencies can then be combined in order to compute the corresponding constraints to complex models, where multiple topologies are present 6 . We stress, however, that in order for this combination to be possible, signal efficiencies and not cross section upper limits must be provided. The major drawback of this approach is that in order for the results to be applicable to a broad class of models, the number of required simplified models and their complexity can easily become very large. For achieving a high level of model independence, it is therefore desirable that the experimental analysis can be recast with MC event simulation. Two ways of presenting results are useful to this end: signature efficiencies and object efficiencies.",

In addition, they are fully model independent for stable particles (within the detector volume), since in this case no assumptions about the LLP decay mode are required at all. In many cases, however, the reconstruction efficiencies depend on multiple kinematic variables, such as the LLP p T , its transverse decay position, impact parameter, etc. As illustrated in Section 6.4.6, these efficiencies can be very useful for recasting LLP searches, but they are not often provided by the experimental collaborations.

For instance, a displaced lepton reconstruction efficiency can be provided as a function of the lepton p T and its transverse impact parameter d 0 .

Furthermore, as illustrated in Section 6.4.6, knowledge of object efficiencies are essential for a general purpose recasting of the search. Within this approach the model dependence is minimal and can be restricted to a few general assumptions about the nature of the LLP. Also, object efficiencies could be searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 163 7 For simplicity we will refer to the signal acceptance times efficiency as \"signal efficiency\".

Simplified models (or simplifiedmodel spectra, SMS) have been widely used for the interpretation of prompt and LLP searches. As discussed in Chapter 2, a large number of SMS topologies are possible for the distinct LLP signatures, which can be grouped by the LLP production mode, decay and lifetime. These SMS topologies aim to capture the main physical properties of the LLP signal and can then be used to constraint other scenarios containing similar topologies. The use of simplified-model results to constrain full models has been shown to be possible [86,99,480,483,495,496], even though it has its shortcomings [99]. Also within the context of LLP searches, the use of simplified model results for reinterpretation can be a good alternative, e.g., when a recasting based on a MC simulation is difficult or is too computationally expensive. In this section, we briefly review how SMS results can be used to reinterpret searches for full models as well as the particular challenges presented by LLP searches. A concrete example of reinterpretation using simplified models is given in Section 6.3.2, based on the results of Ref. [90].",

This procedure does not rely on any Monte Carlo simulation or recasting of LLP searches and can be easily applied to a wide variety of models, provided SMS is known. The main limitation of this approach comes from the limited (although growing) number of SMS results available. Since SMS is typically known only for very few simplified models, the sum in Eq. (6.1) is limited to the number of available topologies, resulting in an under-estimation of S. For prompt SUSY searches, a systematic approach for reinterpreting simplified model results based on the procedure outlined above has been developed in Refs. [480,483]. Furthermore, using the large number of available SUSY SMS results, public tools are available for constraining full models using these results [481,483]. The same procedure can also be applied to LLP SMS results, as shown in Ref. [90] for the case of heavy stable charged particles (HSCPs) and implemented recently in SModelS [491]. In the next section we review some of the results found in Ref. [90]. Although these have been obtained within the context of HSCPs, the main results can be generalized to other LLP signatures, and demonstrate some of the advantages and shortcomings of reinterpretations using LLP simplified models.",

Due to the small mass difference, the stau is long-lived and decays outside the detector, thus generating a HSCP signal. In Figure 6.3, we show the constraint on the CMSSM parameter space obtained using only the simplified model provided by CMS (direct stau production). Since the simplified model only contains one parameter, it translates to a limit on the stau mass (m\u03c4 < 260 GeV), as shown by the blue region in Figure 6 tributes to a small fraction of the total HSCP signal, since staus are typically produced from cascade decays of heavier SUSY states, such as charginos, squarks and gluinos. (Note that these correspond to the heavy-parent modes of Section 2.4.2.) Furthermore, there are several possible topologies which contain a stau and the LSP (\u03c7 0 1 ) in the final state, thus resulting in a mixed missing energy-HSCP signature. Therefore using only the CMS constraints for the direct stau production simplified model largely underestimates the sensitivity of the CMS search.",

Fortunately, a Monte Carlo recasting of the 8 TeV CMS search is possible (see Section 6.4.1 for details) and can be used to compute simplified model efficiencies. In Ref. [90], seven additional simplified models containing cascade decays were considered and their efficiencies computed as a function of the masses appearing in the topology. A summary of the topologies considered are shown in Table 6.1. It is important to point out that it is not necessary to specify the Standard Model final states appearing in the simplified models, since the HSCP search is inclusive and the efficiencies do not depend on the additional event activity. Using this extended database of simplified model efficiencies and Eq. (6.1), we can compute a more inclusive signal yield for each point of the CMSSM parameter space and improve the constraints on the model. The results are shown in Figure 6.4, where we see a drastic improvement in the region excluded by the constraints on HSCPs, as expected.

However the approach relies on a few approximations and is never fully inclusive, since the number of SMS topologies with published efficiencies is always limited. Hence, it is important to verify how close the simplified model reinterpretation comes to the full recasting using a Monte Carlo simulation. In Ref. [90] it was shown that, within the CMSSM scenario discussed above and using eight simplified model topologies, the SMS results reproduce the full simulation within 20% or better.

One important point which becomes clear once we compare Figures 6.3 and 6.4 is the importance of a sufficiently inclusive database of simplified model efficiencies. In particular, depending on the full BSM scenario considered, the minimal set of simplified models proposed in Chapter 2 and Appendix A may not be sufficient to allow for a reinterpretation based on simplified model results alone. The reason is that this set was derived as the minimal set to generate a collection of relatively inclusive signatures, but may not correctly model the efficiency of every UV theory leading to that signature. In these cases, results for additional simplified model topologies are necessary and can be provided by the experimental collaborations or generated by theory groups if a full recasting is available. Furthermore, since LLP searches can be very inclusive, the simplified models considered can also be defined inclusively, as discussed above. In this way a limited number of simplified models can cover a large number of event topologies, thus increasing the SMS coverage of full models.",

Both signatures are sensitive to the particle's velocity and exploit the production of HSCPs outside of the ultra-relativistic regime, allowing for a powerful discrimination against the highly boosted Standard Model backgrounds. HSCP searches assume particles are sufficiently longlived to traverse the entire detector. They have been interpreted for HSCPs that are purely electrically charged or carry color charge, the latter of which hadronize to form R-hadrons as they propagate through the detector [10]. Typically, the HSCP signature yields high sensitivities providing a very strong background rejection while still allowing for large signal efficiencies. As a consequence, search strategies for new physics models with HSCPs typically do not benefit from more model-dependent selection criteria, like requiring additional particles in the event [88]. The corresponding searches can, hence, be performed in a mostly inclusive manner concentrating on the HSCP candidate itself. This fact opens up the possibility of providing a widely applicable recasting based on signature efficiencies. This approach has been followed by the CMS Collaboration [493], which has provided probabilities for HSCP candidates to pass the on-and off-line selection criteria for Run 1 as a function of the relevant kinematical parameters.",

Since the stau only decays outside the detector volume, all cascade decays of the produced sparticles terminate in the lightest stau, which provides the HSCP signature. The left pane of Figure 6.5 compares the resulting signal efficiency obtained by the recasting and the full CMS detector simulation. The signal efficiencies agree within 3%, demonstrating that the recast is an excellent approximation to the full CMS simulation. The differences are of the order of the statistical uncertainties from the MC simulation of the signal. In the right pane of Figure 6.5, we show the 95% C.L. upper limits on the inclusive production cross sections, which, again, agree (within \u223c 3%) with the ones obtained by the full simulation in Ref.

Due to the inclusive nature of the search, the above recasting provides a widely applicable and highly reliable way to reinterpret the HSCP search for arbitrary models containing detectorstable HSCPs. Accordingly it has been used in a variety of phenomenological studies. For instance, it has been used for reinterpretations of supersymmetric models [89,198,500,501] and non-supersymmetric models of very weakly interacting dark matter [135,141]. In Refs. [89,135], the recasting has been used to reinterpret the HSCP search for finite lifetimes by convolving the signature efficiency with the fraction of HSCPs that decay after traversing the relevant parts of the detector. The recasting has also been used for a reinterpretation in terms of simplified models, as discussed in Section 6.3.2.

For a given set of parameters C \u03b2n tested in the fit we compute the signal efficiencies for all mass points with the prescription outlined above. Assigning a \u03c7 2 to each set of parameters C \u03b2n by comparing the resulting signal efficiencies to those reported in [13] we can determine the best-fit correction function F best-fit .",

The signal is simple to generate, where the only challenge is in handling the displacement properly. The most identifying pre-selection requirement of this search is that the transverse impact parameter, |d 0 |, is required to be larger than 100 \u00b5m for both the electron and muon. The impact parameter is not the point where the parent object (e.g., \u03c4 or b) decays, i.e., the v mentioned above, but rather the distance to the point of closest approach of the lepton's track relative to the center of the beampipe in the transverse plane.

The reinterpretation approach in Refs. [26,89] was to construct track information at truth level based on the output of a parton shower program (such as Pythia 8), and then use the truth-level information to construct the various vertex, cluster, and track-level observables for each event. As it is difficult to adequately account for inefficiencies of track and vertex reconstruction, the efficiency of passing the cuts with truthlevel observables was considered and then it was normalized to the results from CMS. To do so, the authors of Ref. [26] simulated identical signal models to those with efficiencies reported by the CMS collaboration, assumed that the MC truth-level reconstruction gave an adequate description of kinematics but not track and vertex reconstruction, and so computed a ratio of truth-level efficiencies to those reported by CMS. The resulting efficiency ratios were used to re-scale the truth-level results of other models, leading to a reinterpretation of the CMS search for different models beyond the ones they considered. The details can be found in Ref. [26]; a more sophisticated approach in which object efficiencies were estimated and applied to tracks and displaced vertices in Ref. [89].",

While the truth-level distributions disagreed with those of CMS for individual observables, the actual multivariate discriminant output agreed with that of CMS at better than 25%. The ratio of truth-level efficiencies to CMS efficiencies are also compared for different LLP masses and kinematics, and these typically agree with one another at the factorof-two level [26].

Consequently, for \u039b of order one TeV, is small (and consistent with present experimental constraints) without requiring the presence of a suppressed coupling in the Lagrangian. This feature distinguishes the dimension-five non-abelian kinetic mixing from the dimension-four kinetic mixing between X \u00b5 and the SM hypercharge gauge boson. The final state with two \u03b3 d (resulting from the X \u00b5 -W 3 \u00b5 mixing) can be produced in one of two ways: (a) electroweak Drell-Yan pair production of triplet scalars that subsequently decay to a \u03b3 d and SM gauge boson via the operator in Eq. (6.6); (b) production of the \u03b3 d and a triplet scalar via O (5) WX with a subsequent decay of the triplet to a second \u03b3 d plus a SM gauge boson via the same operator. In each case, one would expect the presence of two \u03b3 d plus one or more unobserved massive prompt bosons in the final state. The ATLAS DV plus LJ analysis can be recast in a straightforward way for these event topologies, as no information about the unobserved prompt object has been used. It is worth emphasizing that both the production processes as well as the \u03a3 decay rate are independent of the triplet vev, v \u03a3 . The latter only enters and, thus, only affects the dark photon c\u03c4. The corresponding implications of the ATLAS 8 TeV results are indicated in Figure 6.9. The first panel shows the limits on the \u03c3 \u00d7 Br as a function of c\u03c4. The corresponding model sensitivity is shown for different choices of v \u03a3 by the diagonal lines. Note that for fixed v \u03a3 both the \u03c3 \u00d7 Br and c\u03c4 depend on the operator coefficient \u03b2/\u039b, leading to a non-trivial relationship between the two experimental quantities. This situation differs from the FRVZ model, where \u03c3 \u00d7 Br is independent of c\u03c4 since the mixing parameter does not depend on the parameters governing production of the hidden sector particles or their cascade decays. The intersections of the model lines with the ATLAS limits can then be translated into bounds on \u039b/\u03b2 as a function of v \u03a3 for different choices of the dark photon mass (denoted here as m X ), as shown in the second panel of Figure 6.9.

Besides the gaugemediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models [510], which were the main motivation for the non-pointing photon search, this type of signal can also appear in many hidden-sector models. For example, in the dipole-mediated DM model (the \"Dark Penguin\") [149], the production of two heavier dark fermions pp \u2192 Z * /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c7 h\u03c7h is followed by the decays \u03c7 h \u2192 \u03c7 l + \u03b3. If the flavor structures of the DM mass and coupling are aligned, \u03c7 h can be long-lived and give rise to non-pointing photons. Another example is provided by the dark-shower scenario [511,512] that explains the galactic center gamma-ray excess. In this model, many hidden pions can be produced in the same LHC event. Some of these have displaced decays to a pair of SM photons, while others decay outside of the detector, yielding / E T . Notice that in this case the topology of the events is different from the previous examples, as the non-pointing photons and / E T originate from separate particles (and for more discussion on dark showers, see Chapter 7).",

[199] found that fitting only one benchmark did not correctly reproduce the event-level efficiency curve for any of the others. The Delphes package [336] allows for the generic simulation of the response of a typical detector used in high-energy physics experiments. It is widely used for simulating the effects of the ATLAS and CMS detectors or the hypothetical detectors that could be used for the future FCC and CLIC projects. The architecture of Delphes is composed of distinct and specialized modules that interact with each other. The detector is described by the user through an input card, where the modules to be used in the simulation are sequentially enumerated and their input parameters are specified. The detector simulation relies on a mix of parametric and algorithmic modules. More precisely, tracking is simulated through efficiency and smearing functions that are applied to the properties of the electrically-charged stable particles. The particles are then propagated to the calorimeters and dedicated modules simulate the energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The output of such a step consists of a list of calorimetric towers. Moreover, Delphes includes a particle-flow-like algorithm that combines tracking and calorimetric data in order to improve the identification of the final-state objects and the resolution on their reconstructed momenta.",

Realistic efficiencies are applied to the displaced tracks and several parameters specific to this kind of analysis have been made available within MadAnalysis 5. An extension to the case of neutral LLPs decaying into muons outside the tracker volume can be easily implemented, the muons being thus reconstructed only through their hits in the muon chambers. The simulation of the displaced leptons is performed through efficiencies and resolution functions to be specified by the user. Furthermore, another extension allowing the user to handle long-lived charged particles that decay into leptons could be implemented. A similar dedicated tune of Delphes and MadAnalysis was devised for the studies of neutral particles decaying to displaced leptons and jets in Refs. [44,48,162]. 12 The  [190] for different stop decay lengths (c\u03c4\u02dct). We compare the CMS and MadAnalysis 5 (MA5) results in the second and third column of the table, respectively, and the difference taken relatively to CMS is shown in the last column. Consequently, the data-format of MadAnalysis 5 has been extended, so that the Muon and Electron classes now contain the d0() and dz() methods allowing to access the value of the |d 0 | and d z parameters, the closestPoint() method that returns the coordinates of the closest approach point (through the X(), Y() and Z() daughter methods) and the vertexProd() method that returns coordinates of the displaced vertex from which the lepton originates (through the X(), Y() and Z() daughter methods). An analysis example [492] can be found in the public analysis database of Mad-Analysis 5 14 , where information about the re-implementation in MadAnalysis 5 of Ref. [190], an analysis of 2.6 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV LHC data, is available. This is a search for long-lived particles decaying into electrons and muons, where signal events are selected by requiring the presence of either an electron or a muon whose transverse impact parameter lies between 200 \u00b5m and 10 cm. For a given benchmark signal where a pair of long-lived stops is produced through QCD interactions and where each stop further decays into a displaced b-jet and a displaced lepton. In Table 6.6, we present the number of events surviving the selection of the three different signal regions of the CMS analysis. Our event generation has been performed with Pythia 8 [212] and for the benchmark searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 191 scenario used. We observe that a good agreement is obtained, except in the case of long stop lifetimes, c\u03c4 1 m. This is however the region in which no public information on the CMS reconstruction efficiencies is available. The MadAnalysis 5 tune of Delphes has neither been designed for disappearing (or appearing) tracks nor for track kinks. Concerning the disappearing (or appearing) tracks, the only missing experimental ingredients are the track reconstruction efficiency and resolution as a function of the number of missing hits in the (inner) outer layers of the tracker. There is to this date no public material on the tracking performance description related to track kinks.",

As described above, a module designed to smear the full set of track properties, including their transverse and longitudinal displacement, exists (i.e., the TrackSmearing module). In addition, efficiencies based on displacement parameters have already been implemented in MadAnalysis 5 (see above) and a module that performs the matching of an existing jet collection with a track collection based on track displacements is very similar to the already existing TrackCountingBTagging module. Minor modifications to this module are hence needed to be able to select tracks based on an absolute displacement instead of the impact parameter significance. Finally, in order to be able to perform a displaced jet selection, one would need a (not yet existing) module that performs jet clustering on the basis of the secondary vertices and the displaced tracks matched with these jets. Alternatively, a module that includes a vertex reconstruction efficiency and a module including a vertex position smearing could be implemented.",

This simulation could encapsulate the track reconstruction efficiency and resolution, including pile-up effects. Delphes could then optionally be used to mix the resulting \"reconstructed\" tracks with the additional tracks originating from the pile-up vertices. On the other hand, if the analysis under consideration additionally uses calorimetric information (i.e., jets or missing energy), Delphes should be preferred to a fully parametric framework.

In contrast to third-party recasting tools, in which multiple analyses are implemented using a single, common framework that is executed on a single computing element, such an exact analysis re-execution often necessitates a distributed data analysis using a number of different frameworks in use within the experiments. Therefore, RECAST has developed a flexible graph-based analysis description and execution back end [521] that enables a faithful re-execution of nearly arbitrary analysis code on cloud platforms such as those offered by CERN 15 . The back-end provides experiments with an access-controlled interface to view reinterpretation requests, retrieve the necessary analysis description from repositories such as the CERN Analysis Preservation Portal (CAP) [522], execute the analysis on datasets for the new model and -if approved -upload the results to the public front-end. Figure 6.14 shows a screenshot of the current prototype user interface, giving collaboration members an overview over requested points as well as controls to steer processing and submission.",

            "text": "Within the LHC experiments, the ability to reinterpret analyses is, perhaps unintuitively, mostly limited by the internal availability of the analysis routines to the wider collaboration as opposed to, e.g., availability of computing resource constraints. The large number of measurements and searches, the heterogeneity and complexity of the analysis software, as well the size of the collaboration, all lead to a situation in which very often only a small number of analyzers of the original analysis team is able to execute any given analysis. Furthermore, due to the collaborative development model, analyzers are typically responsible for only a subset of the analysis, which results in knowledge fragmentation. Therefore, both ATLAS and CMS are now designing an interface to store analysis-relevant information (the CERN Analysis Preservation Portal, CAP [522]) searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 195 to mitigate this problem. In the context of RECAST, the software and analysis-workflow preservation aspects of this effort are most relevant. The former is mainly implemented through archiving of source-code repositories and the archival Linux Containers, which now enjoy wide-spread industry support, while internal structure of the analysis workflow is archived in CAP in the form of declarative workflow specifications such as yadage [523], which has been developed for RECAST, and the Common Workflow Language (CWL) [524]. It is planned that CAP and RECAST will utilize a common computing back-end in order to re-execute the analyses that have been preserved in the portal. As the preservation is enabled by recent technological advances and the process of archival is increasingly streamlined, it is expected that a higher number of experiment-internal analysis codes will be available for RECAST.",

Prompt searches with and without / E T can therefore provide additional, corroborating constraints on models with LLPs, especially for short lifetimes. Therefore, it is important to understand the sensitivity of prompt searches to displaced objects. Reinterpreting prompt searches in the context of LLPs is, however, quite nontrivial, because a) prompt searches may or may not make explicit requirements on the primary vertex and b) it is currently not documented how reconstruction efficiencies drop as a function of small displacement. Thus, the reinterpretation of prompt searches in the context of LLPs is currently best done within the collaborations themselves.",

Each of these bosons then decays to a muon and c quark, leading to a final state with two muons and two jets from c quarks. In the prompt limit of the RPV SUSY model with a final state of two muons and two jets from b quarks, the kinematics of the LQs are nearly identical. In the LQ search, no selection is made on jet flavor. The LQ search uses final selections which are optimized to the event kinematics for each LQ mass hypothesis, but the search in general strives to remain as model-independent as possible. In this case, the reinterpretation was simply performed using the original LQ analysis, and replacing the signal samples with the long-lived RPV samples, only taking into account the reduced branching fraction to the final state with two muons and two jets. The expected and observed exclusion curves of the reinterpretation are shown in the right frame of Figure 6.16.",

Other reinterpretations along these lines can be found in Refs. [534][535][536]. Another relatively simple reinterpretation is Ref.

Given the complexity of the Standard Model, such hidden sectors may very well have rich dynamics of their own, with numerous far-reaching implications for their phenomenology [60,61,63,64,537]. The main LHC signatures predicted by such hidden valley models are characterized by an injection of a large amount of energy into a hidden sector, which is then shared among a large number of relatively soft particles [63]. We will refer to this class of signatures, where rich dynamics internal to the hidden sector yields a high multiplicity of dark states, as \"dark showers\". Given that the particles emerging at the end of this process are necessarily both comparatively light and secluded from the SM, their lifetimes can easily become long, thus giving rise to displaced signatures at the LHC.",

It is worth noting that QCD already provides many familiar examples of long-lived particles, realizing macroscopic lifetimes through a hierarchy of scales (\u039b QCD /m W ) combined with approximately preserved symmetries (K L , B and D hadrons) or restricted phase space (n). Also provided by QCD are numerous examples of particles that have a hierarchy of lifetimes. For instance, charged pions experience a slow decay through a very off-shell W boson, while neutral pions can decay much faster through their anomalous coupling to photons. The neutral pion lifetime is thus orders of magnitude shorter than the lifetime for charged pions. Both long-lived species and a hierarchy of lifetimes between species are generic predictions and nearly unavoidable consequences of confining theories which produce dark showers. However, LLPs with a hierarchy of lifetimes also arise naturally in non-confining hidden sectors, especially in theories with multiple species. A familiar example from the literature is theories with dark photons. Here, a small kinetic mixing can make the dark photon long-lived, but a simple, well-motivated extension of the model by a dark Higgs boson introduces additional dark species and production mechanisms for dark states that are independent of the small coupling controlling the macroscopic lifetime. This naturally yields high-multiplicity events featuring particles with a hierarchy of lifetimes [32,223,453].",

Alternatively, it is possible that the hidden sector does not contain a gauge sector but instead features a perturbative cascade decay over a large number of states. Indeed, in certain cases the perturbative picture is dual to the strongly coupled showers. In general, showering and hadronization are the sources of greatest uncertainty from a theory perspective; the current status and some new results are discussed in Section 7.3.",

The decay may occur through the same (off-shell) portal as the production, but this is not essential, and one may expect multiple species with a range of lifetimes. The specifics of the decay step (e.g., muon multiplicity) are particularly important if there is no good trigger handle from the production topology. Decays are frequently interconnected with showering and especially hadronization, however, and it is not tractable to enumerate all possibilities without making simplifying assumptions and/or inserting additional theory prejudice. For this reason it is often useful to focus on the species with the largest multiplicity and/or shortest (macroscopic) lifetime; this frequently provides a reasonable guide to the overall signatures, just as one may obtain a reasonable O(1) picture of QCD jets by considering only their pions.

The reason is that the simplest searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 209 derivation of parton shower evolution equations assume that the final state can be organized as a series of splittings where z, \u03b8 1 at each iteration. Since the full matrix element for a given final state has no uniquely-defined splitting history associated with it, this soft, collinear condition needs to hold as a function of the finalstate kinematics alone. As the coupling is increased, the increased showering probability means that there is an increased chance of populating the phase space while violating these conditions.

Singular regions of phase space thus do not contribute to finite values of the thrust, and its measured distribution in QCD is well described by a perturbative calculation up to corrections that scale as O(\u039b QCD /Q) 2 , where Q is a high-energy scale associated with the total system being probed by the thrust.

A useful special case realizing this scenario is one in which all internal hidden sector decays are sufficiently rapid for heavier hidden states to promptly decay down to the lightest state in the spectrum, which in turn decays to the SM. The discussion below is focused on the possible properties of this lightest hidden state which decays to the SM.

In particular, various (multi-)muon triggers can be very effective for models where the LLP branching ratio to muons is not too small. At the same time, displaced hadronic decays tend to give more discriminating power in the off-line analysis, since they produce a larger number of tracks as compared to the leptonic modes. Since each event contains multiple LLPs, a single event can contain both leptonic and hadronic vertices, where one uses the former for the trigger and the latter for off-line background rejection. For this reason it is not straightforward to interpolate sensitivity between lepton-rich and hadron-rich hidden showers, since the optimal search strategy for the intermediate cases is qualitatively different from the strategies for the two extremes. As a starting point for our exploration, we therefore recommend a small number of theoretically motivated decay portals, which cover the fully leptonic and fully hadronic cases, as well as two other intermediate scenarios.

The obvious trend in all cases is that the lifetime rises as the mass decreases, steeply so for the case of the neutrino portal. It is furthermore important to note that the above scalings are lower bounds, and in many models the leading decay portal involves a higherdimensional operator, leading to a stronger scaling with mass. This is especially relevant in confining models where the hidden states are composite particles. For example, in a pure-glue hidden valley coupled though the Higgs portal [557], the lightest glueball can decay through its mixing with the Higgs, but as the portal coupling contains the dimension-four combination of dark gluon field strengths G a \u00b5\u03bd G a\u00b5\u03bd , its width scales as \u0393 \u223c",

Since the LLP has an irreducible production cross section through the same coupling that governs its decay, collider experiments effectively impose a lower bound on the lifetime of these states. Beamdump and supernova constraints on the other hand rely on a displaced signal and constrain the lifetime from above. These bounds are, however, not typically applicable for masses above a few hundreds of MeV (and for a summary of some of the latest constraints on the hypercharge, photon and gluon portals see, e.g., Refs. [559] and [560]). However, particles that can be produced in sizable numbers at the LHC are in general coupled sufficiently strongly to the SM that they face upper limits on their lifetimes from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In most cases, this upper bound is essentially mass independent and requires \u03c4 1 second, but this upper bound can be much weaker for lighter particles and/or particles that decay to hadron-poor final states. For the photon, gluon and hypercharge portals, prompt decays are currently allowed for masses all the way down to the electron threshold, though for the hypercharge portal LHCb is expected to completely close this window below \u223c 100 MeV [335,376]. For the Higgs portal, current LHCb results from b to s transitions [260,261] already require c\u03c4 0.5 mm for masses below 4 GeV. For the neutrino portal, lifetimes c\u03c4 10 m are excluded if the mass is below 1 GeV and the mixing is predominantly with the electron and muon neutrino [561].",

Figure 7.7 shows the distribution of the number of decays occurring in the tracker, calorimeter and muon chamber for two benchmark points. We hereby assume for concreteness the approximate CMS geometry with the \"tracker\", \"calorimeter\" and lhc llp community \"muon chambers\" defined by r < 100 cm, 100 cm < r < 200 cm and 400 cm < r < 700 cm respectively. We find that the number of decays in all detector components is roughly equal, with slightly more decays in the muon chamber for a higher number of LLP decays in the shower. The latter result is easily understood from the larger size of the muon system as compared to the tracker and the calorimeter. The qualitative conclusion is that tracker-based searches for multiple displaced vertices are likely to have reasonable sensitivity over the whole relevant lifetime range. For the longer lifetimes, the sensitivity necessarily degrades although it can be partially recovered by incorporating the muon chamber in the analysis. On the other hand, searches relying exclusively on the muon chamber or the calorimeter are less sensitive to a wide range of lifetimes. To quantify this effect more accurately, detailed simulations for specific benchmark models accounting for more realistic boost and \u03b7 distributions are needed, although the relative importance of the tracker is likely to continue to hold.

            "text": "As emphasized throughout this chapter, dark shower models can produce a high multiplicity of dark particles, ranging from several tens up to thousands of particles in the most extreme case. This motivates triggers that aim to minimize p T thresholds and instead exploit high particle multiplicity. The most obvious option is a suitable multi-muon trigger (three, four, or more muons), where the priority should be to avoid tight isolation criteria, if needed at the expense of increasing the muon multiplicity and/or p T thresholds. Prompt multi-muon triggers would, however, only capture (nearly) prompt decays, and it is critical to pursue the design and implementation of a trigger with good efficiency for displaced muons; see Section 5.1.3 for more on planned displaced muon triggers. Another way of exploiting the particle multiplicity is to trigger on an anomalously large number of tracks originating from the primary vertex. This would likely only work for prompt or nearly prompt decays, in models which produce a rather low muon fraction and/or a very soft p T spectrum. For this strategy to work, one must first pass the L1 trigger with MET, which can be provided by the shower itself or by initial state radiation (ISR). At the HLT it may be possible to count the number of tracks with the planned ATLAS hardware track trigger (HTT) system or the future CMS hardware track triggers. Alternatively, if the tracks are too soft and the multiplicity high enough, it is possible to pass the HLT by looking for an over-density of hits in the innermost tracking layer, centered around the z-coordinate of the primary vertex [235].",

[562,563]), and we are aware of an effort within ATLAS to investigate the inclusion of substructure routines at the HLT level. This strategy could be helpful in cases such as photon-jets (dark showers that decay into SM photons), which can otherwise pose significant trigger challenges: substructure variables such as n-subjettiness [564] and energy-energy correlations can be very effective at separating QCD jets, photons and photon-jets [565,566]. In practical terms, this means that one may be able to use the relatively low threshold jet/tau trigger for the L1 trigger. This could be followed by a HLT trigger that uses, for instance, the ratio of the energy deposited in the ECAL/HCAL or substructure variables.",

In particular, under these assumptions it does not matter if the SM decay products of the lightest dark states are themselves collimated. A clear difficulty with substructure triggers is that the actual dark showering and hadronization process, and therefore the substructure, is theoretically only understood in a handful of example models as discussed in Section 7.3. While such a trigger is clearly valuable for a number of models, it is at the moment difficult to evaluate how broadly applicable it could be to different shower shapes.",

Although the signal is different from a dark shower, the trigger strategy in the search can be useful for dark shower events. The hardware trigger (L0) requires a single hadron, electron, muon, or photon with object-dependent p T thresholds. For muons (hadrons), the thresholds are p T > 1.48 (3.5) GeV, and given the rapidity range of the signal, this corresponds to momenta p > 6 (13) GeV for muons (hadrons). These low p T requirements can thus keep soft and low-mass dark meson decays that can be hard to trigger on at ATLAS and CMS. The software trigger contains algorithms that run a simplified version of track reconstruction and an identification of displaced tracks and vertices, and the first software stage (HLT1) requires a high-quality displaced track satisfying the above p T requirement. In Ref. [382], the final trigger stage (HLT2) further requires a displaced vertex with \u2265 4 charged tracks, and either a > 2 mm decay length in the transverse direction or the reconstructed vertex mass > 10 GeV. Since the search focuses on b-quark final states, the HLT2 trigger also contains a multivariate algorithm to identify b-hadron decays.

Promptly-decaying dark showers are substantially more challenging to separate from backgrounds than showers containing LLPs, as the presence of multiple displaced objects is a very powerful background-suppression tool. However, the techniques that have been proposed and/or used for prompt showers are important for several reasons. First, they provide a useful illustration of how the unique properties of showering events have been approached in analyses to date without introducing the separate complication of displacement. Second, dark showers that produce prompt SM particles may very well also produce LLPs, thanks to the hierarchies of lifetimes that are generic in confining theories. Such events can thereby produce semi-visible jets [366], which contain detectorstable invisible states as well as promptly-decaying states.

For example, for decays governed by the Higgs, photon, and neutrino portals, one may expect an unusually muon-rich jet (Section 7.4). Similarly, the jet may be semi-visible (Section 7.6.1.1) if some of the states do not decay in the detector volume. On the other hand, if the SM final states are almost purely hadronic, as when decays are governed by the gluon portal, no such obvious handles are available and one must look at the substructure of the jets themselves to find differences from those in typical QCD events.

Reconstructing these objects requires the elimination of lepton isolation criteria typically imposed on leptonic final states, together with variables such as layer-specific cuts on energy deposited in the ECAL, and a fraction of high-threshold TRT hits and/or activity in the muon chambers, selecting for electromagnetically dominated radiation.

However, by considering combinations of large amounts of / E T and differing cuts on \u2206\u03c6, the angular separation between the / E T and the closest jet, control of both SM backgrounds and discrimination from more typical SUSY-like high / E T scenarios can be achieved.

While this topic is presently relatively uncovered, with only a few exploratory results available [573], similar techniques to those that have proven useful for quark/gluon discrimination seem promising. In both cases the lack of a perturbatively-generated hard scale means that parametric separation of signal and background is challenging. Infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables related to jet mass, such as girth and two-point energy correlations are reasonably well studied in QCD, with results readily generalizable to other gauge theories [574][575][576]. For quark/gluon discrimination, observables characterized by Poisson-like distributions such as particle/track multiplicities or production ratios of particular SM particles tend to yield better discrimination, but suffer from being IRC unsafe and thus subject to large non-perturbative modeling uncertainties [577], a significant point of concern when extending their use beyond QCD. Here, some recently developed IRC-safe generalizations of multiplicity [578] may prove useful. Another approach might be to explore machine-learning techniques that do not require fully labelled data for training (so-called weak supervision) [579][580][581]. These can be trained directly on data, here at least in the case of the QCD background, so that modeling concerns about the shower can be partially alleviated. While achieving a sizable signal-tobackground ratio is likely to be the major challenge in using such jet observables to separate dark showers from QCD, it is vital to note that if signal/background separation can be achieved through other means, e.g., by reconstructing displaced vertices, these same tools offer an enormously powerful window onto the underlying dynamics of the dark shower.",

If couplings controlling the shower can no longer be treated as small at any scale, the QCD-inspired picture of pencil-like jets starts to break down, and we might expect that showers radiate more copiously at ever larger angles, so that large-R jets can become necessary to adequately capture the underlying hard process. This is first and foremost a triggering challenge, since it is no longer clear that triggers designed for local hard depositions can maintain their sensitivity. It is likely that a viable trigger path either needs to rely on a prompt associated object from the production mechanism (ISR jet, lepton, etc.) or on a high multiplicity of leptons in the shower itself. Of course, H T triggers continue to be useful for those models with sufficiently high event energy scales, provided that a sufficient amount of the radiation in the event clusters into trigger objects of sufficiently high p T (\u223c few \u00d7 10 GeV) to be counted in the H T trigger. As long as the event can be triggered on, observables similar to those at the end of Section 7.6.1.1 should still prove useful to separate signal from background, possibly even more so, since the radiation pattern in the dark shower can now be expected to be substantially different from QCD.",

            "text": "In the large-'t Hooft coupling regime, in which we expect much more showering at large angles than in QCD (see Section 7.3), the final states are soft and spherically distributed in the rest frame of the shower. This leads to so-called soft unclustered energy patterns (SUEPs) in the detector. In the rest frame of the event, the momenta of the final-state SM particles are on the order of the hadronization scale of the dark strong dynamics. If this scale is much lower than 100 MeV, the decay products are too soft to be reconstructed as tracks and the entire shower is effectively invisible. In this case existing jets+MET searches can apply. For a hadronization scale around O(100 MeV), some amount of ISR can be needed to boost the particles enough to render a fraction of them reconstructable. Finally, if the decay products are on average harder than O(100 MeV), the tracks associated to the SUEP vertex can typically be reconstructed off-line, subject to momentum-dependent reconstruction efficiencies. The main parameters of interest are accordingly the number of charged particles produced and the corresponding p T spectrum. Also important are the fraction of invisible particles and the composition of SM particles in the final state. In particular, since the momenta of the invisible particles balance on average, they are are not likely to give rise to a substantial / E T signal unless the dark shower is recoiling against a relatively hard ISR jet. A large fraction of invisible particles will instead degrade the sensitivity of a strategy relying on track multiplicity. The muon fraction, on the other hand, can be a powerful handle: even though the average muon p T may be very low, due to the high particle multiplicity a handful of muons may still be hard enough to pass the trigger and reconstruction thresholds of the muon systems. A major background to SUEP-like signals comes from pileup, which also yields a large number of isotropically distributed soft tracks, though in contrast to SUEP signatures, pile-up tracks arise from multiple vertices. Studies on the multiplicity of charged tracks from minimum-bias interactions like single, double or nondiffractive collisions are described in Ref. [582]. As shown in Figure 7.8, the fraction of 13 TeV pp collisions having 80 or more associated charged tracks is O(10 \u22123 ), as measured in a pile-up-free environment. Some benchmark SUEP models are described in Ref.

The mean number of charged tracks per jet is less than ten for jets O(100 GeV) [584]. To get to O(100) charged tracks, as expected from a SUEP signature, a very high number of jets is needed, hence the perturbative cross section is heavily suppressed by many orders in \u03b1 s .

It is worth remarking that the experimental signature of a displaced decay to electrons can be very similar to the signature of a displaced decay to a pair of charged pions, and thus searches for lepton-jets frequently cover pionic final states as well. Searches to date have targeted lepton-jets containing up to two lepton (pion) pairs. To further extend coverage into low-mass regimes, it may be of interest here to investigate the samples stored through data scouting for, e.g., di-muon resonances, although the limited information retained in scouted events likely makes this a promising avenue only for sufficiently short lifetimes that dedicated displaced track reconstruction is not necessary.",

The number of associated tracks is also crucial for the vertex reconstruction in both the inner detector and the muon spectrometer. Hence, the composition of hadronic and leptonic particles in the final states may have a significant impact on the ability to reconstruct the associated vertices and/or the size of the expected backgrounds. Moreover, as the track momentum and multiplicity in the vertices drop, the odds increase that one or more tracks belonging to a particular vertex are not reconstructed. The efficiency of reconstructing displaced tracks in the inner tracker falls off substantially with displacement, as particles traverse fewer layers of the tracker: for particles produced at r = 30 cm from the interaction point, this efficiency is \u223c 0.35 at ATLAS [248] and \u223c 0.25 at CMS [585]. Explicitly requiring vertex reconstruction can thus come at a large cost in signal acceptance, especially for LLP decays that produce only two tracks per vertex. However, a large number of unassociated tracks with a large impact parameter is still a striking signature, despite the larger backgrounds that come with relaxing requirements on vertex reconstruction. This is the idea behind a recent CMS search [310], based on the model of Ref. [325] (see below). Whether or not explicit DV reconstruction is helpful depends on relative signal and background rates, and can be model dependent.",

These criteria assume that jets can be reconstructed using the calorimeters, which should be very efficient for the considered lifetimes in the model. CMS has recently published a search for this model [310], finding excellent sensitivity for the benchmark model developed in Ref.

When dark showers originate from a SM singlet, such as the Higgs boson or a Z , the problem of preselection becomes more acute. The overall mass scale of signal events can easily be small, making event H T useless for signal separation. Here perhaps one of the most robust avenues for preselection is muon multiplicity: as discussed in Section 7.4, many of the operators governing LLP decays tend to predict muon-rich final states. With 2 LLPs in an event, muon number becomes a useful and inclusive preselection criterion that places no demands on the possible presence of associated objects, event H T , or detailed shower shape.",

For the reconstruction of secondary vertices in the inner detector in ATLAS and CMS, currently a minimum track p T of 1 GeV is required [230,586]. Having vertices with several tracks fulfilling this minimum p T requirement might be rare if the hidden sector hadronization scale is low, and this is particularly true for low mediator masses. In this case, dedicated search strategies might be needed (particularly for short lifetimes). For example, it may be possible to look for increased multiplicity of hits in the outer layers of the inner detector compared to the inner parts, though unassociated hits from secondaries may be a significant background. A subtraction of hits from tracks stemming from vertices close to the beam pipe might be helpful, but dedicated studies are needed to assess the viability of this approach. In addition, the calorimeter may be another handle on this type of event: a large collection of soft particles could collectively contribute a non-standard energy pattern in the calorimeters provided the LLP lifetime is suffi-ciently long and if the calorimeter segmentation in radial direction is exploited. However, if the LLPs can reach the calorimeter, their decays typically take place over a distance longer than or comparable to the size of the calorimeter itself. This effect could wash out the signal to the extent that it may be difficult to observe above background, though a full truth-level simulation of this effect is certainly warranted.",

In searches for DVs in a particular detector element, it may be advantageous to bin signal and background in terms of the number of reconstructed vertices with very loose \u03b7 and \u03c6 requirements. While more difficult experimentally, it would also be highly valuable to eventually supply the transverse distance of each vertex from the interaction point on an event-by-event basis, combining the different detector elements. This would allow for straightforward reinterpretation of searches to models with different shower shapes, lifetimes and p T spectra, allowing a single search to transparently apply to a very broad model space.

Another regime occurs when at least one species decays promptly, while the others are either stable or decay outside of the detector, which gives rise to a semi-visible jet [366] (see Section 7.6.1.1 above). The intermediate scenario, where some dark states decay promptly while others have macroscopic detector-scale lifetimes, is equally generic.

Thus. it should be possible to design powerful and inclusive searches which would be sensitive to a very large portion of the vast model space without needing to rely on poorly predicted (and model-dependent) properties such as shower shape. Toward this end we have identified several promising directions for future study for both theory and experiment, and provide some recommendations here. As always, one of the primary challenges in searches for dark showers is ensuring the events are recorded on tape. In some models, dark showers may be accompanied by / E T , H T , or a number of associated leptons that can be triggered on, but there are many scenarios where this is not the case, or where these handles come at the expense of a large reduction in signal rate. The foremost example of this is when the dark shower is initiated by an exotic Higgs decay. It is thus critical to pursue dedicated trigger strategies, and we present a few ideas here. We expect that displaced triggers designed for singly-or doubly-produced LLPs will typically have reasonable acceptance for dark shower events, though we caution that in some cases the non-isolation of LLPs in dark shower events may limit their acceptance. Another promising avenue for triggering on dark showers exploits the high particle multiplicity typical of such events, and we recommend study of triggers on (displaced) multi-muons in particular.",

New studies of showering in the intermediate regime were performed for the purpose of this document (presented in Section 7.3), which revealed that different approaches can yield qualitatively different phenomenology. On the one hand, this provides interesting opportunities for searches to make use of event shape and/or jet substructure variables, in particular if the decays of hidden sector states occur promptly or with small displacements. On the other hand, for larger displacements it implies that one should be careful not to heavily bias the selection choices of a search towards a particular shower shape, and rely instead on the displaced LLP decays to separate signal from background. We expect that the most inclusive, most broadly applicable, and most readily reinterpreted searches will be those in which the data is binned in terms of the number of reconstructed displaced objects and their locations within the detector.

[30,32,110,120,177,570,[588][589][590][591]. Experimental searches for lepton-jets have been presented in Refs. [263,[265][266][267], where Refs. [265,266] focus on lepton-jets with displaced vertices.",

We have assumed \u03c7 production through a Z portal with a mass of 1 TeV, with a production cross section of 0.58 pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 0.85 pb at 8 TeV. We show exclusion limits from the ATLAS search for prompt lepton-jets in 5 fb \u22121 of 7 TeV data [592] (blue shaded region) and from the ATLAS displaced lepton-jet search in 20.3 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV data [265] (red shaded region). The lighter colored region around m A = 2 GeV corresponds to the transition region between an analysis in terms of hadron final states and an analysis in terms of quark final states and is based on interpolation. The computation was carried out in Pythia 8 [213,593,594]; see Ref. [587] for details.

One can also have a t-channel scalar bifundamental mediator, X, which carries color and dark color and can decay to a quark and a dark quark. In the case of the scalar mediator, the only allowable coupling is of the form L \u2283 \u03ba ijqi q d,j X + h.c. , (7.11) where \u03ba ij is a 3 \u00d7 n f matrix of Yukawa couplings. One could also add multiple flavors of X mediators, something that has also been implemented [539]. When dark quarks are produced, they shower and hadronize and the same tools that are familiar for QCD can be used to simulate these processes. Because of the large gap between the mediator mass and the confining scale, there will be large particle multiplicity and the dark hadrons will typically form into jet-like structures. In the large N d limit, the fraction of dark baryons produced is suppressed, and in the case of QCD this fraction is O(0.1). Therefore the hadronization in these simulations is typically dominated by dark mesons. The lightest hadronic states are the dark pions \u03c0 d , acting as goldstone bosons of the U(n f ) \u00d7 U(n f ) dark flavor symmetry. When a heavier mesonic state is produced it will promptly decay into dark pions if kinematically allowed, making the dark pions the dominant component of the dark showering process.",

The jet emerges as it travels through the detectors.

This differs from the s-channel interaction, in which no breaking occurs, and n f -stable vs. n f (n f \u2212 1)-unstable dark pions exist.",

            "text": "The research program carried out over the first nine years of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been an unqualified success. The discovery, in 2012, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, of a new particle thus far consistent with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson has opened numerous new research directions and has begun to shed light upon the source of electroweak symmetry breaking, vector boson scattering amplitudes, and the origin of particle masses. And the establishment of a wide range of searches for new physics at 7, 8, and 13 TeV with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb detectors -searches thus far consistent with SM expectations -has inspired new ideas and thinking about the most prominent open issues of physics, such as the nature of dark matter, the hierarchy problem, neutrino masses, and the possible existence of supersymmetry. The overwhelming majority of searches for new physics have been performed under the assumption that the new particles decay promptly, i.e., very close to the proton-proton interaction point (IP), leading to well-defined objects such as jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse momentum. Such objects are constructed requiring information from all parts of the detector including hits close to the IP, calorimeter deposits known to be signatures of particles originating from the IP, and muons with tracks that traverse the entirety of the detector, moving out from the IP. However, given the large range of particle lifetimes in the SM --resulting from general concepts such as approximately preserved symmetries, scale hierarchies, or phase space restrictions --and the lack of clear, objective motivation related to any particular model or theory beyond the SM, the lifetime of hypothetical new particles is best treated as a free parameter. This leads to a wide variety of spectacular signatures in the LHC detectors that would evade prompt searches, and which have received modest attention compared to searches for promptly decaying new particles. Because such signatures require significantly customized analysis techniques and are usually performed by a smaller number of physicists working on the experimental collaborations, a comprehensive overview and critical review of beyond-SM (BSM) LLPs at the LHC has been performed by a community of experimentalists, theorists, and phenomenolo-gists. This effort ensures that such avenues of the possible discovery of new physics at the LHC are not overlooked. The results of this initiative have been presented in the current document.",

Currently, we only provide simplified model libraries for neutral LLPs. The simplified models for LLPs with electric or color charges are equally compelling, but their simulation is more subtle. In particular, the simulation of the propagation and decay of the LLPs are more challenging if the LLP carries a SM gauge charge. Such effects can be included in detector simulations using GEANT4 [224], but decay processes typically need to be hard-coded into GEANT or otherwise interfaced with other MC programs. This is an important issue for the community to address, as discussed in Sections 2.4.2-2.4.3. Without implementing the decays, it is straightforward to use the SUSY model to simulate the production of any of the electrically or color charged LLPs.",

As a result, we searching for long-lived particles beyond the standard model at the large hadron collider 251 typically provide only one set of instructions for simulating each simplified model channel. We begin by presenting the simplified model library instructions for Double Pair Production (DPP) in Table A.1, Heavy Parent (HP, QCD-charged parent) in Table A.2.

Prospects at proton beam-dump experiments are also shown for an already existing experiment, NA62[281], and for the planned experiment SHiP[282]. Existing constraints from direct searches are indicated as coloured solid lines[283][284][285][286][287]. The lines labelled \"Seesaw\" and \"BBN\" show lower theoretical constraints from the observed neutrino masses (assuming a normal hierarchy) and primordial nucleosynthesis, respectively[288].

Finally, if a sufficiently broad spectrum of simplified models is covered, this can be useful for quickly testing complex models which feature a large variety of signatures, and rapidly finding the interesting region in a model scan before going to more precise but computationally more expensive MC simulation.

The dark photon can be produced via final-state radiation from dark matter produced in a collider. Due to the collinear enhancement radiation of the dark photon, this can lead to a perturbative dark shower [587].",
