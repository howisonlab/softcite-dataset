The analysis uses data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.3 fb \u22121 , respectively. The search is sensitive to Higgs bosons produced either through the gluon fusion process or in association with a bb quark pair. No statistically significant excess is observed in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 mass spectrum. Results are interpreted in the framework of several benchmark scenarios, and the data are used to set an upper limit on the MSSM parameter tan \u03b2 as a function of the mass of the pseudoscalar A boson in the range from 115 to 300 GeV. Model independent upper limits are given for the product of the cross section and branching fraction for gluon fusion and b quark associated production at \u221a s = 8 TeV. They are the most stringent limits obtained to date in this channel.",

The observation of a new boson with a mass of 125 GeV and properties compatible with those of the SM Higgs boson [8][9][10] confirms the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Despite the success of this theory in describing the phenomenology of particle physics at present collider energies, the mass of the Higgs boson in the SM is not protected against quadratically divergent quantum-loop corrections at high energy. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [11,12] is one example of alternative models that address this problem. In SUSY, such divergences are cancelled by introducing a symmetry between fundamental bosons and fermions.",

The analysis is sensitive to all the three bosons, h, H, and A in the mass range between 115 and 300 GeV. The search is performed by the CMS collaboration using data recorded in pp collisions at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 19.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The common experimental signature of the two processes is a pair of oppositely charged muons with high transverse momentum (p T ) and a small imbalance of p T in the event. The AP process is characterized by the presence of additional jets originating from b quarks (b jets), whereas the events with only jets from light quarks or gluons are sensitive to the GF production mechanism. The presence of a signal would be characterized by an excess of events over the background in the dimuon invariant mass corresponding to the \u03c6 mass value.",

Searches for the MSSM Higgs bosons have been performed at LHC by the LHCb experiment in the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 final state at large pseudorapidity values [20], the ATLAS experiment in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channels [21,22], and by the CMS experiment in the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 [23] and bb [24,25] final states. Limits on the existence of MSSM Higgs bosons were also determined at Tevatron [26][27][28][29] and at LEP [30]. Traditionally, searches for MSSM Higgs bosons are presented in the context of benchmark scenarios that describe the mass relation among the three neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, their widths, and cross sections. Each scenario assigns well defined values to the relevant parameters of the MSSM, except m A and tan \u03b2, which are left free to vary. The m max h benchmark scenario [19,31] provides m h values as large as 135 GeV, and the weakest bounds on tan \u03b2 for fixed values of the top quark mass. For this reason, it has been used in most of the previously quoted analyses to present the results from MSSM Higgs boson searches. However, within the MSSM the newly discovered state with a mass of 125 GeV can be interpreted as the light CP-even Higgs boson, h [32]. In this case, a large part of the m A -tan \u03b2 parameter space is excluded within the m max h scenario, and new benchmarks were therefore proposed in which the MSSM parameters are adjusted to have m h in the interval 122 to 128 GeV, but with a wider range of tan \u03b2 and m A values [19,31,32]. To do this, the m max h scenario was reformulated in two versions, m mod+ h and m mod\u2212 h , corresponding to different values of the top squark mixing parameter. Other recently proposed scenarios [31] are the light top squark (light stop) model, which results in a modified GF rate, and the light tau slepton (light stau) model, which yields a modified h \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 branching fraction. Such models are expected mainly to affect the Higgs boson production cross section and not the kinematic properties of the events. A list of the parameters of the various scenarios can be found in Ref. [23]. The results presented in this paper are obtained in the framework of the MSSM m mod+ h scenario. Comparisons are also made with other benchmarks.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each comprised of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Forward calorimetry extends the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 5. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [33]. The CMS offline event reconstruction creates a global event description using the particle flow (PF) technique [34]. The PF event reconstruction attempts to reconstruct and identify each particle with an optimized combination of all subdetector information. The missing p T vector is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . An average of 9 and 21 pp collisions take place in any LHC bunch crossing, respectively at 7 and 8 TeV, because of the large luminosity of the machine and the size of the total inelastic cross section. These overlapping events (pileup) are characterized by small-p T tracks, compared to the particles produced in a \u03c6 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 event, and their presence can degrade the detector capability to reconstruct the objects relevant for this analysis. The primary vertex is chosen from all reconstructed interaction vertices as the one with the largest sum in the squares of the p T of the associated tracks. The charged tracks originating from another vertex are then removed.",

The \u03c6 production cross sections and their corresponding uncertainties are provided by the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [16][17][18]. The cross sections for the GF process in the m max h scenario are obtained using the HIGLU program [40,41], based on next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The sushi program [42] is used for the other benchmarks. For the AP process, the four-flavor NLO QCD calculation [43,44] and the five-flavor next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD calculation are implemented in bbh@nnlo [45] and combined using the Santander matching scheme [46]. The Higgs Yukawa couplings computed with the feynhiggs program [47] are used in the calculations. The decay branching fractions to muons in the different benchmark scenarios are obtained with feynhiggs and hdecay [48]. Further details on signal generation can be found in Refs. [16][17][18]. The values of m h predicted by feynhiggs differ typically by a few GeV from those computed with pythia. The invariant mass spectrum of the h boson is therefore shifted to match the feynhiggs prediction. The small difference between pythia and feynhiggs in assessing the width of the h boson is of the order of 100 MeV, and therefore neglected, since the experimental mass resolution is at least one order of magnitude larger. The pythia parameters used to simulate the signal are those for the m max h scenario. Since for a given set of m A and tan \u03b2 values, the kinematic properties of the final state are the same for all the scenarios, the simulated samples based on the m max h benchmark are also used to check the validity of the other models. Further details on this procedure and the related systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 7.",

The details of the event selection are listed below, and summarized in Table 2. The events are selected using a single-muon trigger, which requires at least one isolated muon with p T > 24 GeV in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.1. The distance of the primary vertex along the z axis from the nominal centre of the detector must be |z PV | < 24 cm. Muon candidates are reconstructed and identified using both the inner tracker and the muon detector information. The selected events must have at least two oppositelycharged muon candidates, each with p T > 25 GeV. In events with more than two muon candidates, the two with opposite charges and the highest p T are retained. The \u03b7 of both muon candidates is chosen to match the trigger acceptance. Each muon track must have at least one hit in the pixel detector, more than five or eight layers with hits in the tracker, respectively, for the 8 and 7 TeV data and a directional matching to hits in at least two different muon detector planes. In addition the global fit to the hits of the muon candidate must include at least one hit in the muon detector. The \u03c7 2 /dof of the global fit of the muon track must be smaller than 10. These requirements ensure a good measurement of the momentum, and significantly reduce the amount of hadronic punch-through background [38]. To reject cosmic ray muons, the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters of each muon track must satisfy the requirements |d xy | < 0.02 cm and |d z | < 0.1 cm, respectively. Both parameters are defined relative to the primary vertex. To ensure that the trigger muon candidate is well-matched to the reconstructed muon track, at least one of the two muon tracks is required to match the direction of the trigger candidate A correction is applied to account for the possible contamination from neutral particles arising from pileup interactions. A muon is accepted if the value of the corrected isolation variable is less than 12% of the muon p T . A selection based on E miss T provides good separation between signal events and tt background, in the case of leptonic decay of This value represents a good compromise between efficiency to tag b jets in signal events from AP (\u224880%) and mistagging probability for light-quark jets (\u22481%). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of b disc in originated from b quark fragmentation tend to be emitted more forward in signal events than for tt, thus resulting in a lower observed b-jet multiplicity. For this reason the tt background is further suppressed by rejecting events with more than two b-tagged jets, without significantly affecting the selection efficiency for signal. The events are split into two mutually-exclusive categories. The first category (C1) contains events with at least one jet identified as originated from b-quark fragmentation (b tagged), and provides highest sensitivity to AP production channel. Events that do not contain b-tagged jets are assigned to category 2 (C2), and provide sensitivity to GF production. The dimuon invariant mass distributions for the C1 and C2 categories are shown in Fig. 4 for data and simulated events for both centre-of-mass energies. The distributions expected for MSSM Higgs bosons with m A = 150 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 30, derived from the m mod+ h scenario are also given for comparison. A double peak structure around 125 and 150 GeV appears in the C2 category, due to the hboson and A + H bosons, respectively. The lower peak is not visible in C1, as the h production is suppressed in the AP mechanism relative to the GF process. ",

Events with invariant mass significantly smaller than its nominal value have a lower reconstruction efficiency than those produced near the mass peak. For consistency, we define signal efficiency as the probability for a signal event with the generated invariant mass close to its nominal value to be reconstructed and pass all selection requirements of this analysis. The closeness is defined using a window of size equal to 3 times the intrinsic signal width (an uncertainty associated with this definition is evaluated using a window of 5 times its width, as discussed in Section 7). With this definition, the product of the MSSM Higgs boson production cross section, luminosity and signal efficiency provides the normalization for the Higgs boson produced near on-shell. The full predicted rate of signal events also contains an additional off-shell contribution, which varies with m A and tan \u03b2 and is less than 5% for m A < 250 GeV and tan \u03b2 < 15, and can be as large as 15% for m A = 300 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 30.",

The average of the weight factors computed over all the events is very close to one, reflecting the fact that the simulation describes the data with good accuracy. GF events in the two event categories varies with m A and tan \u03b2, since the production cross sections of the two processes depend on these parameters.

The uncertainty is between 1% to 3% for the C1 and 1% to 5% for the C2 categories. Table 3 lists the systematic uncertainties that affect the determination of signal efficiency. The impact of these systematic uncertainties on the exclusion limits that will be presented in Section 8 is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty. All the systematic uncertainties in Table 3  Since the number of background events is determined through a fit to the data, an additional systematic uncertainty arises from the possibility that the background parametrization may not adequately describe the data as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. A method similar to that described in Ref. [10] is used to evaluate the effect, by estimating the uncertainty through the bias in terms of the number of signal events that are found when fit-ting the signal + background model (as described in Section 6) to pseudo-data generated for different alternative background models. Such alternative background parametrizations include Bernstein polynomials and combinations of Voigtian and exponential functions. Bias estimates are performed for mass points between m A = 115 and 300 GeV. For each m A value, the largest bias among the tested functions is taken as the resulting uncertainty. The bias is implemented as a floating additive contribution to the number of signal events, constrained by a Gaussian probability density with mean of zero and width set to the systematic uncertainty. The width of the Gaussian is the largest systematic uncertainty, and the effect is to increase the expected limit on the presence of a signal by 20% in the region near m A = 120 GeV and by about 10% at larger mass values.",

Uncertainties in the muon momentum determination can affect the invariant mass measurement, and have been carefully studied in data and simulation [38]. The dimuon invariant mass resolution for masses above the Z peak has been previously studied in the search for a SM Higgs decaying to a dimuon pair [58]. The mass resolution determined from data at the Z mass value is 1 GeV, in excellent agreement with the prediction from simulation. This value is consistent with the mass resolution of 1.2 GeV that we estimate from simulation for a mass of 115 GeV, that corresponds to the lower edge of the Higgs mass range considered in this analysis.",

Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the parameter tan \u03b2 are computed using the CL s method [59,60], which is a modified frequentist criterion, and are presented as a function of m A . Systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters and treated according to the frequentist paradigm [61]. The results are obtained from a combination of both event categories and centre-of-mass energies. For each value of m A , the value of tan \u03b2 at which the CL exceeds 95% is chosen to define the exclusion limit on that m A . This is performed for all the m A values and the results are shown in Fig. 7. These results are obtained within the m mod+   Limits on the production cross section times decay branching fraction \u03c3 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) for a generic single neutral boson \u03c6 are determined. In this model independent analysis no assumption is made on the cross section, mass, and width of the \u03c6 bosons, which is sought as a single resonance with mass m \u03c6 . The analysis is performed assuming the narrow width approximation, for which the intrinsic width of the signal is smaller than the invariant mass resolution. For this purpose the simulated signal of the A boson for the case tan \u03b2 = 10 is used as a template to compute the detection efficiency for a generic \u03c6 boson decaying to a muon pair. The single \u03c6 boson is assumed to be produced entirely either via the AP or the GF process, and the search for a single resonance with mass m \u03c6 is performed. The 95% CL exclusion on \u03c3 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) is determined as a function of m \u03c6 , separately for the two production mechanisms. The combination of events belonging to C1 and C2 is shown in Fig. 9, assuming the \u03c6 boson is produced either via the AP or the GF process. Only data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV are used, as they provide a better sensitivity because of the higher luminosity. In addition, since the \u03c6 production cross section depends on the centre-of-mass energy, a combination with the 7 TeV results would introduce a model dependence in the description of the cross section evolution with energy. For m \u03c6 = 500 GeV, values \u03c3 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) > 4 fb are excluded at 95% CL for both production mechanisms. These are the most stringent results in the dimuon channel to date.",

            "text": "search has been performed for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 from pp collisions collected with the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.3 fb \u22121 , respectively. The analysis is sensitive to Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, and via association with a bb quark pair. The results of the search, which has been performed in the mass range between 115 and 300 GeV, are presented in the m mod+ h framework of the MSSM. With no evidence for MSSM Higgs boson production, this analysis excludes at 95% CL values of tan \u03b2 larger than 40 for Higgs boson masses up to 300 GeV. Comparisons with m mod\u2212 h , m max h , light stop, and light stau scenarios are also presented, and offer very similar results relative to the m mod+ h benchmark. Limits are determined on the product of the cross section and branching fraction \u03c3 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) for a generic neutral boson \u03c6 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, without any assumptions on the MSSM parameters. In this case the \u03c6 boson is assumed to be produced either in association with a bb quark pair or directly through gluon fusion, and sought as a single resonance with mass m \u03c6 . Exclusion limits are in the mass region from 115 to 500 GeV.",
