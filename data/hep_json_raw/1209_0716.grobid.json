            "text": "The NuMI Off-axis \u03bd e Appearance (NOvA) experiment is a two-detector, long-baseline, atmosphericregime neutrino oscillation experiment designed to address a broad range of open questions in the neutrino sector through precision measurements of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 , and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 oscillations. As the name implies, much of NOvA's physics scope comes from the appearance channels, as the observed rates of \u03bd e and \u03bd e interactions provide information on (1) the ordering of the neutrino masses (i.e., whether the \u03bd 3 state is more or less massive than the other two), (2) the amount of CP violation present in the neutrino sector, (3) the size of the PMNS mixing angle \u03b8 13 , and (4) whether the \u03bd 3 state has more \u03bd \u00b5 or \u03bd \u03c4 admixture (that is, whether \u03b8 23 > \u03c0 4 or < \u03c0 4 , respectively). Recent results by shortbaseline \u03bd e disappearance experiments demonstrating \u03b8 13 \u2248 9 \u2022 [1,2,3] ensures that NOvA will have substantial event rates in the appearance channels. Through \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance, NOvA will provide improved precision on the dominant atmospheric oscillation parameters \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 atm . 1 On behalf of the NOvA collaboration.",

The suppressed high-energy tail at NOvA's off-axis location reduces neutral current backgrounds in the visible energy range of 1 to 3 GeV where the appearance of \u03bd e CC events should occur. The NuMI source is undergoing upgrades to increase its average beam power from 350 kW to 700 kW. Much of the increased power comes from a reduction in the Main Injector cycle time, which will drop from 2.2 seconds to 1.3 seconds. This cycle time reduction is in turn made possible by reconfiguring the antiproton Recycler as a proton injection ring, thereby allowing ramping in the Main Injector to occur concurrently with the next injection. The NuMI upgrades are scheduled to last 12 months, ending May 2013.",

Each cell extends the full width or height of the detector -15.6 m in the FD, 4.1 m in the ND -and is filled with liquid scintillator. Light produced by the scintillator is collected and transported to the end of the cell by a wavelength-shifting fiber that terminates on a pixel of a 32-channel avalanche photodiode. Figure 2 shows a sketch of the FD and ND along with a cut-away view of the PVC lattice. Each of the 928 layers of the FD has 384 cells, for \u223c360,000 total channels of readout. The ND has 206 layers each with 96 cells plus a muon range stack at the downstream end (not shown in the figure) made by interleaving steel plates with standard detector layers. Figure 3 shows three simulated events in the NOvA ND. Muons are clearly identifiable as long, straight tracks with appropriate energy deposition per unit pathlength ( dE dx ). Proton tracks can be separated from other hadron tracks by their dE dx profiles. The NOvA detector technology is particularly well-suited for electromagnetic shower identification, as the radiation length in the detector (38 cm) is many times larger than the relevant PVC cell dimensions. This level of granularity helps \u03c0 0 decays stand out, as the decay photons leave telltale gaps in detector activity between the neutrino interaction location and the photon conversion point, as in the bottom panel of Figure 3.",

The NDOS sits 110 mrad off the NuMI beam axis and approximately on the Booster beam axis and is identical in size to the ND except in its width, with 64 cells spanning it horizontally rather than 96.

Several features in the figure deserve mention. 1The absence of any inverted hierarchy contours in the top panel indicates the >2\u03c3 significance of hierarchy determination expected in this scenario. (2) The bottom panel shows a \"degenerate\" scenario, in which CP violation and long-baseline matter effects introduce cancelling perturbations in the oscillation probabilities. In such scenarios, NOvA provides only correlated information on the mass hierarchy and \u03b4. 3NOvA's \u03b8 23 octant sensitivity is largely independent of the hierarchy and \u03b4.
