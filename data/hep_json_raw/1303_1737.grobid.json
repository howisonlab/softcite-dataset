            "text": "The B \u00fe c meson discovered by the CDF at the Tevatron [1], is the only known meson composed of two flavors of heavy quarks, charm and beauty. Both quarks can decay via the weak interaction with the other quark being considered as a spectator, therefore a wide range of decay channels is possible. However, only a few of these channels have been experimentally observed [1][2][3][4]. The LHC opens a new era for B \u00fe c physics, with an expected production cross section of $0:4 b at center-of-mass energy ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV for the B \u00fe c meson [5,6]. The LHCb experiment has observed the decay B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe [7], and new channels such as B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 [8] have started to emerge. We report here the first observation of the decay B \u00fe c ! c \u00f02S\u00de \u00fe with c \u00f02S\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 and the measurement of the ratio of branching fractions B\u00f0B \u00fe c ! c \u00f02S\u00de \u00fe \u00de=B\u00f0B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe \u00de. The inclusion of charge conjugate modes is implied throughout the paper. The relativistic quark model [9] and several other models [10][11][12][13] make various theoretical predictions for this ratio of branching fractions. As a two-body decay, B \u00fe c ! c \u00f02S\u00de \u00fe is under better control theoretically than B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 \u00fe , and therefore this measurement is particularly useful to test the models of B \u00fe c decays. The B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe decay mode is chosen as the normalization channel because of its identical final state and similar event topology. Both channels take advantage of the large trigger efficiency due to the two muons in the final state.",

The detector [14] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors and good kaon-pion separation is achieved for tracks with momentum between 5 GeV=c and 100 GeV=c. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger system [15] consists of a hardware stage based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software trigger that applies a full event reconstruction and reduces the event rate from 1 MHz to around 3 kHz.",
