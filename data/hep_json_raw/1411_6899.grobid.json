In agreement with the expectations, differences between B + , B 0 , B 0 s , 0 b , 0 b and \u2212 b lifetimes not exceeding a few per cent are found experimentally [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The B + c meson is a bound state of an anti-b quark and a charm quark, and Cabibbo-favoured decays of the charm quark are expected to account for 70% of its total width, resulting in a significantly shorter lifetime than for other B mesons. In addition, non-spectator topologies, in particular annihilation amplitudes, are not Cabibbosuppressed. These could give sizeable contributions to the total width [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. Understanding the relative contributions of beauty and charm quarks to the total width of the B + c meson is important for predicting the properties of unobserved baryons with two heavy quarks [19,20].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [31]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [32]. The trigger [33] comprises two stages. Events are first required to pass the hardware trigger, which selects muon candidates with p T > 1.5 GeV/c or pairs of opposite-sign muon candidates with a requirement that the product of the muon transverse momenta is larger than 1.7 (2.6) GeV 2 /c 2 for data collected at",

Subsequently, a multivariate estimator based on an artificial neural network algorithm [52,53], configured with a cross-entropy cost estimator [54], in the following referred as MLP classifier, is applied. The same criteria are used for both the B + c and B + candidates. The selection starts from well-identified muon candidates that have a transverse momentum in excess of 550 MeV/c. Pairs of muon candidates are required to form a common vertex and to have an invariant mass within \u00b160 MeV/c 2 of the known J/\u03c8 mass [5]. To ensure that the J/\u03c8 candidate originates in a b-hadron decay, a significant decay length with respect to the pp collision vertex is required. The charged pions and kaons must be positively identified using the combined information from the RICH, calorimeter and muon detectors. The B + c and B + candidates are formed from J/\u03c8\u03c0 + and J/\u03c8K + combinations, respectively.

The final selection of candidates using the MLP classifier is based on the transverse momenta and rapidities of reconstructed B + c (B + ) and J/\u03c8, the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the \u03c0 + (K + ) candidate, the cosine of the decay angle \u03b8 between the momentum of the \u03c0 + (K + ) in the rest frame of the B + c (B + ) candidate and the boost direction from the B + c (B + ) rest frame to the laboratory frame, the \u03c7 2 of the B + c (B + ) vertex fit, and \u03c7 2 fit . These variables provide good discrimination between signal and background whilst keeping the selection efficiency independent of the B + c (B + ) decay time. The MLP classifier is trained on a simulated sample of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + events and a background data sample from the mass sidebands of the B + c signal peak. It is tested on independent samples from the same sources. The working point of the classifier is chosen to minimize \u03c3(S)/S, where S is the B + c signal yield and \u03c3(S) is the yield uncertainty, as determined by the mass fit described in the next section.

The latter is the only criterion explicitly affecting the lifetime acceptance. The selection criteria are varied, allowing up to a 20% increase in the statistical uncertainty for . Variation of the working point of the MLP classifier results in changes of 0.025 mm \u22121 c in . Tightening the J/\u03c8 meson vertex displacement criterion leads to a 0.050 mm \u22121 c change in . These changes are assigned as systematic uncertainties. The result is also stable with respect to the choice of the input variables used in the MLP classifier. An alternative selection using a boosted decision tree [59] is used for comparison with the MLP classifier. The variation of does not exceed a small fraction of its statistical uncertainty, and no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned.
