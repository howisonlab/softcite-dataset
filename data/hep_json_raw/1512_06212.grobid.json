            "text": "Jets are copiously produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC. In the standard model, the hard-scattering interaction between partons inside the protons is described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Particle-level predictions, however, require a nonperturbative (NP) modeling of hadronization and multiple parton interactions in addition to the QCD calculation. The predicted rate and kinematics of jet production are sensitive to the composition of the proton described by the parton distribution functions (PDF) and to the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ). The evolution of PDFs and \u03b1 S with the increase in the magnitude of the fourmomentum transfer is determined by the renormalization group equations of perturbative QCD [1-3]. Precision measurements of inclusive jet production cross sections at different center-of-mass energies can be used to determine PDFs and \u03b1 S as well as to search for deviations in their behavior from QCD predictions [4]. Inclusive jet cross section measurements have been performed at the LHC [5][6][7][8] and at other high energy colliders [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. The measurements (up to 592 GeV) presented here extend the jet transverse momentum reach of the previous studies. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch",

The analysis is performed with data from pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV with the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.43 pb \u22121 . Originally designed as a reference for heavy ion studies, this data set also provides an opportunity to close the wide gap in jet measurements between the Tevatron at 1.96 TeV and the LHC at 7 and 8 TeV. When combined with the cross section measurements at other center of mass energies the present measurement can be used to improve PDF constraints. The data presented in this paper are collected at low instantaneous luminosity conditions with, on average, 1.2 primary interactions per triggered event. The measured cross section is compared to the prediction from a next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculation, performed using the NLOJet++ (v.4.1.3) generator [17,18] implemented in the FastNLO (v.2.1.0) framework [19]. NP contributions to the cross section are taken into account in the theoretical prediction; electroweak contributions are negligible [20].",

Forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gasionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

            "text": "The particle-flow (PF) algorithm [22,23] is used to reconstruct and identify individual particles in an event with optimally combined information from the various subsystems of the CMS detector. The particles are identified as: charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, muons, electrons, and photons. The PF candidates are combined into jets using the antik T algorithm [24] as implemented in the FastJet software package [25]. A wide reconstruction cone with a radius of 0.7 is used to reduce the sensitivity to final-state radiation. Particles identified as charged hadrons are assigned the pion mass, while neutral hadrons are considered massless and the four-vector sum of all reconstructed particles in the jet is calculated. The measurements of jet energy and momentum in the CMS detector are affected by a number of experimental factors, such as the limited coverage of the tracking system and the nonlinear calorimeter response. The tracking system provides superior jet reconstruction (i.e., systematic uncertainties due to energy calibration and resolution) in the central region of the detector (|\u03b7| < 2.4). To correct for the detector response, the measurements are calibrated using reference processes with well-understood kinematics [26]. Jet energy corrections are derived using simulated events, generated with Pythia6 (v.6.4, tune Z2*) [27] and processed with Geant4 [28]. The most recent Pythia6 Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [29], which uses the CTEQ5L parton distribution set, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L [30]. The corrections are verified in data using \u03b3 +jet and Z+jet processes, and additional corrections are applied to compensate for any mismatch between simulation and data. The correction factors depend on jet p T and \u03b7, and typically range between 1.02 and 1.10, while the jet energy resolution amounts to 15 % at a jet p T of 10 GeV, 8 % at 100 GeV, and 4 % at 1 TeV.",

The response function is initially derived by calculating jet resolution in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for every p T and |y| bin. Jet resolution in data is found to be worse than in simulations [26]. The response function is corrected for this defect by degrading the resolution by factors c data/MC that vary with |y| as listed in Table 2. The response matrix is constructed by convolving the response function with the p T part spectrum predicted by NLO QCD calculations and the CT10 PDF set [32]. (Results with other PDF sets are discussed in Sect. 6.) The response function is represented by a kernel density estimation (KDE) technique that accurately models the tails of the distribution. The theoretical p T part spectrum is fitted with an exponential of a continuously differentiable function (Akima spline) [33]. This spline function is sampled many times and convolved with the KDE response function to obtain the response matrix. The D'Agostini iterative unfolding method [34] is used, as implemented in the RooUnfold software package [35]. The unfolding procedure is regularized by early termination of iterations; four iterations are performed in each rapidity bin.",

The first source affects the jet spectrum observed in data, while the second modifies the detector response matrix used in the unfolding procedure. The third source, measured integrated luminosity, contributes an overall cross section uncertainty of 3.7 % [44]. The uncertainty associated with the jet energy determination consists of several independent contributions identified in the process of deriving the jet energy corrections. These contributions are described in detail in Ref. [26]. The corresponding cross section uncertainty is 5-22 % for the low-rapidity bins (|y| < 2.5), increasing to 78 % in the highest rapidity bin (2.5 \u2264 |y| < 3.0). The jet energy resolution uncertainty is estimated using the uncertainties in the c data/MC scaling factors presented in Table 2. For the rapidity region |y| < 2.5, the corresponding cross section uncertainty is 2-3 %, increasing to 22 % for the most forward rapidity bin. The higher uncertainty at forward rapidities is caused by the significant increase in the jet energy and resolution uncertainties, and the more steeply falling p T spectrum in comparison with the central rapidity region.",

            "text": "The energy offset due to additional interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup) is small. For the lowest p T jets considered (74 GeV) the pileup contributes an average of only 0.3 % of the energy. This fraction decreases with increasing p T . Consequently, pileup corrections are not required and the associated uncertainties are negligible. An uncertainty arising from the potential mismodeling of trigger and jet selection requirements is found to be 1 %. The unfolding uncertainty due to the initial theoretical model is calculated by testing various models and finding the effect is negligible. The sum in quadrature of all experimental systematic uncertainties in the cross section is, on average, 6 % at low rapidi- ties (|y| < 2.0) and varies from 10 to 80 % at higher rapidities (2.0 \u2264 |y| < 3.0), across the corresponding p T ranges. The uncertainty in the theoretical cross section prediction is estimated from the PDF uncertainties, the choice for the factorization and renormalization scales (\u03bc F and \u03bc R ), and the variation in the modeling of NP corrections. The PDF uncertainty, for all PDF sets except NNPDF3.0, is calculated as the change in the cross section caused by varying decorrelated PDF parameters. The relevant PDF eigenvectors are provided in the PDF sets along with the central values. The uncertainty due to each parameter is determined at 68 % confidence level (CL), and the resulting asymmetric uncertainties are combined in quadrature. In the case of NNPDF3.0, the PDF set contains an ensemble of replicas corresponding to one standard deviation in the PDF. The PDF uncertainty is calculated by evaluating the standard deviation in the cross section derived by using different replicas. The uncertainty due to the variation of the value of \u03b1 S (M Z ) in the PDF sets is found to be much smaller than other uncertainties (<1 %) and is not included. The scale uncertainty is determined by varying the factorization and renormalization scales with respect to the nominal value (\u03bc = jet p T ) using the following combinations of (\u03bc F /\u03bc, \u03bc R /\u03bc) ratios: (0.5, 0.5), (1, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The largest deviation from the nominal cross section, found separately in each p T and |y| bin, is taken to represent the scale uncertainty. The scale uncertainty is asymmetric and its distribution is skewed towards lower cross sections. The largest deviation from the average value of the C NP correction factors, which are obtained with the Pythia6 and Herwig++ generators as discussed in Sect. 5, is used as the measure of the NP modeling uncertainty. It contributes a 2-5.6 % uncertainty in the cross section prediction. The uncertainties in the theoretical predictions differ for each PDF set considered, and typically vary in the 10-20 % range over most of the kinematic region.",
