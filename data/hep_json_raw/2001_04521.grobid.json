            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics accurately describes a broad range of observations, but it does not provide an explanation for many of its own features. Among the most prominent of these features is the existence of three fermion generations, encompassing both leptons and quarks. Attempts to explain the observed generation structure have led to a class of models postulating that quarks and leptons are composite objects that consist of more fundamental constituents [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. In these models, the fundamental constituents are bound by an asymptotically free gauge interaction that becomes strong below a characteristic scale \u039b. Such compositeness models predict the existence of excited states of quarks (q * ) and leptons ( * ) at the characteristic scale of the new binding interaction. Since these excited fermions couple to ordinary SM fermions, they could be produced via contact interactions (CI) in collider experiments, with subsequent decays to SM fermions through the gauge interactions (GIs), via the emission of a W or Z boson or a photon (\u03b3), or via a CI to other fermions.",

The partial width of the CI decay is independent of f and f . Interference between GI and CI transitions is not considered [6].

Figure 2 shows the variation of the branching fractions of the different decay channels as a function of M * /\u039b, illustrated in figure 2 (left) for couplings of 1.0. Couplings below unity are also possible and can have a significant impact on the branching fractions, as seen in figure 2 (right) for couplings of 0.1. Weaker couplings reduce widths for the gauge-interaction decays while enhancing the CI decays. A range of couplings is included in the interpretation of the experimental results.
