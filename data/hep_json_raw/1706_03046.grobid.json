The measurement is performed by selecting events that contain a photon with transverse momentum p T > 15 GeV, an isolated lepton with large transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets, where at least one is identified as originating from a b-quark. The production cross section is measured in a fiducial region close to the selection requirements. It is found to be 139 \u00b1 7 (stat.) \u00b1 17 (syst.) fb, in good agreement with the theoretical prediction at next-to-leading order of 151 \u00b1 24 fb. In addition, differential cross sections in the fiducial region are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the photon.",

Studies of the production and dynamics of a top-quark pair in association with a photon (tt\u03b3) probe the t\u03b3 electroweak coupling. For instance, deviations in the p T spectrum of the photon from the SM prediction could point to new physics through anomalous dipole moments of the top quark, as discussed in refs.

            "text": "Photons can originate not only from top quarks, but also from their decay products, including the quarks and leptons from the decay of the W bosons. In addition, they can be radiated from incoming partons. Evidence for the production of a top-quark pair in association with an energetic, isolated photon has been found in pp collisions at the Tevatron collider at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV by the CDF Collaboration [7]. Finally, observation of the tt\u03b3 process was reported by the ATLAS Collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [8]. This paper describes a measurement of the tt\u03b3 production cross section, based on a data set recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The cross section is measured with a maximum-likelihood fit using templates defined within a fiducial volume chosen to be close to the selection requirements implemented in the analysis. Only final states with exactly one reconstructed lepton (electron or muon), including those originating from \u03c4 lepton decays, are considered. These final states are referred to as the single-lepton channel in the following. In addition to the inclusive cross section, differential cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum p T and the pseudorapidity \u03b7 of the photon are measured for the same fiducial volume. The cross sections are compared to the theoretical calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) [9] in the strong interaction.",

For |\u03b7| < 2.5, the calorimeter has three layers, longitudinal in shower depth, with the first layer having the highest granularity in the \u03b7 direction, and the second layer collecting most of the electromagnetic shower energy for high-p T electrons or photons. A thin presampling layer in the range |\u03b7| < 1.8 is used to correct for the energy lost by EM particles upstream of the calorimeter. The hadronic calorimeter system, which surrounds the electromagnetic calorimeter, is based on two different active media, scintillator tiles or liquid argon, and with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber materials. Photons are identified as narrow, isolated showers in the EMC with no spill-over into the hadronic calorimeter. The fine segmentation of the ATLAS calorimeter allows efficient rejection of jets fragmenting to high-energy \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 mesons that could be misidentified as isolated prompt photons.",

The tt\u03b3 matrix element is generated at leading order (LO) including the decays of the top quarks. The photons can be emitted from the incoming partons, from the top quark, or from the decay products. The renormalisation (\u00b5 R ) and factorisation (\u00b5 F ) scales are chosen such that the top-quark pair (tt) events, produced with the same settings as used for the tt\u03b3 production, describe the tt data well. The scale choice is made to have the best agreement with the results in ref. [16]. Good agreement with the data is obtained for \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = 2m top , where m top = 172.5 GeV is the mass of the top quark used in all simulated samples. In order to avoid infrared and collinear singularities, the following kinematic requirements are applied to the generated events: the photon transverse momentum must be larger than 10 GeV and the absolute value of its pseudorapidity less than 5, at least one charged lepton with a transverse momentum larger than 15 GeV, and the distance \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 between the photon and all other charged particles in the final state must be larger than 0.2. The CTEQ6L1 (LO) PDF [17] is used both for the matrix element and in the Pythia 6 parton shower, using the corresponding Perugia2011C tune [18]. Additional photon radiation is generated with Photos 2.15.4 [19,20]. The decays of the \u03c4 leptons are handled by Tauola 2.7 [21]. The signal sample is simulated for single-lepton and dilepton tt\u03b3 events. The sample is normalised to the NLO prediction using K-factors, as described in section 7.2.",

No dedicated samples were produced for Z\u03b3+jets final states due to the expected small contribution to the total uncertainty.

The hadronic fakes are less isolated at higher p T values, as they are more likely to arise from energetic jets which have larger p iso T values. The dependence on \u03b7 is due to the varying amount of material in front of the calorimeter. Because of the different p T and \u03b7 distributions of the hadronic fakes in the control region and in the signal region, the hadronic-fake template for the total cross-section measurement is calculated as a weighted sum of templates determined in bins of the hadronic fakes: five for p T (here, the same bins as for the photon p T in the differential cross-section measurement are chosen) and two for |\u03b7| (|\u03b7| < 1.80 and 1.80 < |\u03b7| < 2.37). The weights w are the fraction of the hadronic-fake events in a given p T or \u03b7 range, estimated from another control region in data, closer to the signal region although with fewer events, in order to correct the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the hadronic fakes. This region is defined exactly in the same way as the signal region, described in section 4, but replacing the nominal photon selection by one where the photon fails to satisfy at least one of the tight identification criteria. The difference in the event topologies between the two control regions was found to have a negligible effect on the final template shape.

In the Z \u2192 e + fake \u03b3 selection the electron is required to have a larger p T than the photon. In both selections the object with the larger p T is the tag while the other one is the probe, i.e. the tag is always an electron.",

In order to estimate this background, a control sample is created that uses the same event selection as for the signal except that the lepton identification criteria are loosened. To account for the sample composition in fake and real leptons, each event is assigned a weight computed from the matrix method [57] in order to obtain a distribution corresponding to fake leptons. To calculate the contribution of events with a prompt photon in this sample, a likelihood fit is performed on the p iso T distribution of these weighted events, using the prompt-photon and hadron-fake templates described in section 5.1 and section 5.2, respectively. This results in estimated background contributions of 7.5 \u00b1 3.6 events in the electron channel and 8. observed in data is smaller than the prediction obtained using the Sherpa generator, and thus a scale factor is applied to the prediction of the simulation. This scale factor is derived from a control region in data and is 0.69 \u00b1 0.16 for the electron channel and 0.76 \u00b1 0.14 for the muon channel. The control region is defined exactly as for the signal region, except for the required number of jets (between one and three), the number of b-tagged jets (exactly one), and for an additional requirement on the invariant mass of the lepton and the photon, which has to be less than 40 GeV. The uncertainties include the statistical and systematic uncertainty induced by the subtraction of the non-W \u03b3+jets events from the control region. A comparison between Alpgen and the nominal generation with Sherpa gives an additional 20% uncertainty. For the Z\u03b3+jets, single-top and diboson production with an additional photon, a 50% theoretical uncertainty is assumed. In addition, all uncertainties discussed in section 8 are taken into account. The expected yields for these backgrounds are summarised in table 1.",

The LO calculation agrees with the cross section from MadGraph within 2%, for scale choices of both m top and 2m top .

The overall K-factor was calculated to be K = 1.90 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b1 0.12, with the first uncertainty accounting for scale variation and the second for PDF set variation.
