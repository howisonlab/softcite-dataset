The ratio of branching fractions B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp)/B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K * (892) + ) is measured to be (1.054 \u00b1 0.057(stat) \u00b1 0.035(syst) \u00b1 0.011(B))%, where the last uncertainty reflects the uncertainties in the world-average branching fractions of \u039b and K * (892) + decays to reconstructed final states. The invariant mass distributions of the J/\u03c8\u039b, J/\u03c8p, and \u039bp systems produced in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay are investigated and found to be inconsistent with the pure phase space hypothesis. The analysis is extended by using a model-independent angular amplitude analysis, which shows that the observed invariant mass distributions are consistent with the contributions from excited kaons decaying to the \u039bp system.",

The interest in B hadron decays to charmonium-baryon systems has increased since the observation of three pentaquark states in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8pK \u2212 decays by the LHCb Collaboration [4,5]. While these states are beyond the available phase space of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay, this process can target potential low-mass pentaquark states in the J/\u03c8p system, as well as new resonances in the J/\u03c8\u039b system, where one of the new states is expected to appear close to the threshold and represent itself as a threshold enhancement [6]. Recently, the existence of a molecular JHEP12(2019)100 baryon state decaying to J/\u03c8\u039b and potentially accessible via the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay has been predicted [7].",

Exploring the large available integrated luminosities of pp collisions and the large production cross section of bb pairs at the CERN LHC, the CMS experiment has developed an efficient trigger for displaced J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, described in section 3. This trigger allowed CMS to conduct this study of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay, including the measurement of its branching fraction and the study of the J/\u03c8\u039b, J/\u03c8p, and \u039bp systems.

In what follows, the K * (892) + particle is denoted as K * + . The ratio of the branching fractions is measured using the following formula: 1) where N and correspond to the number of observed decays and the total efficiency of the decay, respectively. The total efficiency includes the product of efficiencies for the subsequent decays K * + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + , K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 + . The invariant mass distributions of the J/\u03c8\u039b, J/\u03c8p, and \u039bp systems produced in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay are investigated using a model-independent angular analysis.",

Crucial to the investigation of the \u039bp system is the possibility of intermediate high-mass K * + resonances that can decay to \u039bp [3]. We list these resonances in  collectively as K * + 2,3,4 . The details of the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K * + 2,3,4 , followed by K * + 2,3,4 \u2192 \u039bp are discussed in section 8.

The 2D efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the 2D histogram at the reconstruction level to that at the generator level. The data are corrected for the reconstruction efficiency by applying a 1/ (M (\u039bp), cos \u03b8 K * ) weight to each event. Efficiency values at each point in the 2D space are evaluated using a bilinear interpolation algorithm. Since the points inside the border bins of the 2D space cannot be interpolated, the efficiency values at these points are assumed to be the values at the centers of the corresponding bins.  Table 1.

To account for the event selection efficiency, each event is assigned a weight equal to 1/ (M (p\u039b), cos \u03b8 K * ), where (M (\u039bp), cos \u03b8 K * ) is obtained from simulation, as described in section 5. Background subtraction is performed using the sPlot technique, with the J/\u03c8\u039bp invariant mass as the discriminating variable. Figure 3 shows the efficiency-corrected and background-subtracted invariant mass distributions of the J/\u03c8p, J/\u03c8\u039b, and \u039bp systems. These invariant mass distributions are compared with the pure phase space decay hypothesis (shown by the dashed lines), obtained from the generator-level simulation. The data are poorly described by the pure phase space hypothesis in all three distributions. The degree of incompatibility between the data and this hypothesis is measured using the likelihood ratio method and is determined to be at least 6.1, 5.5, and 3.4 standard deviations for the J/\u03c8p, J/\u03c8\u039b, and \u039bp invariant mass distributions, respectively. More details of the significance calculation are given in section 8.1. We conclude that none of the three mass spectra can be adequately described by a pure three-body nonresonant phase space decay hypothesis, which is an indication of more complex dynamics in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay.",

To test the compatibility of data with the H L8 hypothesis, 2000 pseudo-experiments were generated, each with the number of signal events, N , equal to the one observed in data, according to the probability density function corresponding to this hypothesis F X (H L8 ), where X stands for the projection on the invariant mass of the corresponding system. An additional hypothesis H cos \u03b8 has a probability density function F X (H cos \u03b8 ) that accounts for all the features in the cos \u03b8 K * and M (\u039bp) distributions observed in data. It is obtained by reweighting the pure phase space simulation to reproduce the cos \u03b8 K * distribution in data (shown in figure 4) in each M (\u039bp) bin, as well as by reweighting the M (\u039bp) spectrum in simulation to match the one observed in data. Therefore, the F X (H cos \u03b8 ) function reflects the total angular structure of the \u039bp system and provides the best description of the M (J/\u03c8\u039b) and M (J/\u03c8p) invariant mass spectra. The logarithm of the likelihood ratio is used to define the test statistic:",

The first source is the function used to describe the background component in the M (J/\u03c8\u039bp) distribution, which enters through the sPlot background-subtraction procedure. This uncertainty is estimated by using two alternative models for the background component in the M (J/\u03c8\u039bp) spectrum: the baseline model multiplied by a polynomial of either first or second order. Another source of systematic uncertainty is due to statistical fluctuations in the 2D efficiency calculation, discussed in section 5. To test how the significance is affected by these fluctuations, additional parameterizations of the 2D efficiency are considered: a histogram with wider bins and a fit to the efficiency distribution with 2D polynomials, with the uncertainties obtained from the fit taken into account.",

We note that since the quoted statistical significances for the J/\u03c8p and J/\u03c8\u039b systems are not independent, they cannot be combined without properly taking into account the correlation. While the presence of new resonances in an intermediate two-body system produced in this decay cannot be ruled out, the deviation of the data from a pure phase space model can be adequately described by including only the known K * + 2,3,4 resonances in the \u039bp system.",

Using the world-average branching fraction of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K * (892) + decay, the branching fraction of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay is determined to be (15.1 \u00b1 0.8 (stat) \u00b1 0.5 (syst) \u00b1 0.9(B)) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , the most precise measurement to date. A study of the two-body invariant mass distributions of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039bp decay products demonstrates that these spectra cannot be adequately modeled with a pure phase space decay hypothesis. The incompatibility of the data with this hypothesis is more than 6.1, 5.5, and 3.4 standard deviations for the J/\u03c8p, J/\u03c8\u039b, and \u039bp invariant mass spectra, respectively. A model-independent approach that accounts for the contribution from known K * + 2,3,4 resonances with spins up to 4 decaying to the \u039bp system improves the agreement significantly, decreasing the incompatibility with data to less than three standard deviations in both the J/\u03c8p and J/\u03c8\u039b invariant mass spectra.",
