The Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model was sought in the mass range 90 GeV< m H < 200 GeV in all main production modes at the Tevatron: gluon-gluon fusion, W H and ZH associated production, vector boson fusion, and ttH production, and in five main decay modes: * )  , and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. An excess of events was seen in the H \u2192 bb searches consistent with a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 115 GeV< m H <135 GeV. Assuming a Higgs boson mass of m H = 125 GeV, studies of Higgs boson properties were performed, including measurements of the product of the cross section times the branching ratio in various production and decay modes, constraints on Higgs boson couplings to fermions and vector bosons, and tests of spin and parity. We also summarize the results of searches for supersymmetric Higgs bosons, and Higgs bosons in other extensions of the Standard Model.",

In 1964 the existence of a massive scalar boson became a key testable prediction of the Higgs mechanism, [3][4][5][6] which is the simplest description of how the observed masses of the W and Z gauge bosons, as well as those of the fermions, are consistent with the SU(2) L \u00d7U(1) Y gauge symmetry. This symmetry, when broken by the Higgs mechanism to the U(1) EM symmetry of quantum electrodynamics, provides the basis of the Standard Model (SM), [7][8][9] a very successful framework that predicts, or at least accommodates, all particle physics measurements made to date. The mysteries of dark matter, dark energy, and a quantum description of gravity remain beyond the scope of the SM, though the Higgs bosons produced in the laboratory can be a window to testing alternate hypotheses motivated by these unexplained phenomena. For many years, the nonobservation of exotic particles, Higgs bosons among them, have constrained many possible models of new physics.",

Models of exotic Higgs boson production provided motivation to search for Higgs bosons even with smaller data sets.

[13][14][15][16] No significant deviations from the predictions for the SM Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV were seen.

A doublet of self-interacting complex scalar fields is introduced that, by virtue of the opposite sign of the quadratic and quartic terms in the Higgs potential, acquires a vacuum expectation value at the minimum of the potential, which has a threedimensional degeneracy. This degeneracy would result in three massless Goldstone bosons, which are not observed. Instead, the three degrees of freedom appear as the longitudinal polarization components of the W + , W \u2212 , and Z bosons, endowing these particles with their masses. The fourth degree of freedom has finite-mass excitations corresponding to a neutral scalar boson H with a mass m H that is not predicted by the theory. Together with the gauge interactions of the SM, the Higgs mechanism completes the model by allowing for both fermion and gauge boson masses while preserving renormalizability. 17 ",

The Hgg coupling is dominated by a top-quark loop, although the b-quark loop also contributes a non-negligible amount. The presence of additional gluons radiated by the gluons coupling to the Higgs boson increases both the gg \u2192 H production cross section at hadron colliders, and the decay branching ratio for H \u2192 gg. Gluon radiation also modifies the branching ratios of the Higgs boson to quarks. Because of the small couplings of the Higgs boson to the u and d quarks, the primary constituents of the proton, the gg \u2192 H production mechanism is the dominant process at both the Tevatron and the LHC. The sub-dominant processes are production in association with a vector boson (qq \u2192 W H, ZH, referred to as V H), as well as vector boson fusion (VBF) (qq \u2192 q \u2032q\u2032 H), and Yukawa radiation from a top quark pair (ttH) or a b-quark pair (bbH), the latter of which can be dominant in extensions of the SM with enhanced couplings to down-type quarks.

The gg \u2192 H production rate is computed at next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) with next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) soft-gluon summation accuracy in QCD (referred to as NNLO+NNLL), [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] including the effects of mixed QCD-electroweak corrections and the running b-quark mass. Higherorder corrections are very important in this process due to the strong coupling of gluons to additional particles: the next-to-leading order (NLO) k-factor is approximately 2.0, and at NNLO, there is an additional factor of \u223c 1.5. A partial calculation at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) in QCD 28 provides some confidence that the corrections from further terms in the series become smaller, and are adequately covered by the factorization and renormalization scale uncertainties customarily assigned. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) used in the cross section calculations used for the Tevatron results are the MSTW2008 set 29 and the recommended uncertainties. 30,31 The differential spectrum of gg \u2192 H production is complex and has experimental consequences. The production rates for gg \u2192 H + 1 jet and gg \u2192 H+ \u2265 2 jets have been calculated at NLO in QCD, 32,33 and the p T spectrum at NLO+NNLL. [34][35][36] The theoretical uncertainty on the total production rate for gg \u2192 H is approximately \u00b110%, 26,27 although the uncertainty on the production rate for gg \u2192 H+jets is significantly larger -it is \u00b123% for the \u2265 2 jets category. The CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations follow the procedure of Ref. 37 in order to account for the correlations (positive and negative) between the predictions of the rates in the exclusive observable jet categories used to analyze the data. The impact of the factorization and renormalization scale uncertainties on the PDF uncertainties are considered correlated with the factorization and renomalization scale uncertainties and are added linearly with those. The remaining components of the PDF uncertainties are considered uncorrelated.",

            "text": "The observation of a SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC has established the existence of a state of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector, but it has not proven that the minimal SM Higgs mechanism provides a full description of it. In fact, many extensions of the SM postulate the existence of an extended scalar Higgs sector. For instance, introducing a second Higgs doublet, such as in Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM), 63,64 leads to five physical Higgs bosons: a light and a heavy CPeven Higgs boson (h and H), a CP-odd Higgs boson (A), and a pair of charged bosons (H \u00b1 ). The MSSM is, at leading order, an example of a Type-II 2HDM, where up-and down-type quarks couple to separate Higgs doublets. CP violation in the MSSM Higgs sector 65,66 would relax the production selection rules and enlarge the possible space of parameters to search. The next-to-minimal MSSM (NMSSM) 67 further extends the MSSM to include an additional CP-even and CP-odd neutral Higgs bosons. In the NMSSM, the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson, a, can be very light, even below the bb threshold. Alternatively, Higgs triplet models extend the SM by adding a complex SU(2) L triplet scalar field, predicting a pair of doubly-charged Higgs bosons (H \u00b1\u00b1 ), in addition to the five Higgs bosons present in 2HDMs. Finally, some extensions of the SM predict the existence of massive metastable particles that can only decay to SM particles through diagrams containing a new high-mass force carrier or a loop of very massive particles. These scenarios, referred to as \"hiddenvalley\" (HV) models, 68 can involve a HV scalar particle that can mix with the SM Higgs boson, so that the latter could decay with substantial branching ratio to HV particles. [69][70][71] Additional particle content may be present to augment the SM's three generations of fermions and its set of gauge bosons. A model that consists of the SM with one additional generation of fermions is referred to as SM4. 72 The presence of two very heavy quarks would lead to an enhancement in the ggH coupling by a factor of approximately three, since each heavy quark Q would contribute as much as the top quark in the SM. The contributions to the ggH amplitude are nearly independent of the masses of the new heavy quarks as the suppression factors from the propagators cancel the enhancement from the QQH couplings. [73][74][75] The gg \u2192 H production cross section therefore rises by a factor of approximately nine relative to the SM prediction in the range of m H the Tevatron is sensitive to, and the partial decay width of the Higgs boson to gluons also increases by a factor of nine. Even with a higher decay rate to a pair of gluons, the H \u2192 W W ( * ) decay mode continues to dominate for m H > 135 GeV.",

Multivariate Algorithms (MVAs) are designed to key on the large mass (\u2248 5 GeV) and long lifetimes (\u2248 1.4 ps) of B hadrons. Charged tracks from B (and subsequent D) hadron decay tend to have significantly larger impact parameters with respect to the beam axis than tracks created promptly at the primary vertex, whose impact parameters are dominated by resolution effects and multiple scattering. Displaced vertices are identified topologically and their properties, such as the invariant masses of the contributing tracks, the decay length, and the presence of leptons are all used to separate b jets from light-flavored jets. [81][82][83][84][85][86] Typical performances achieved for b tagging are 50% efficiency for b jets from top quark decay with a 0.5% mistag rate of light-flavored jets in the same momentum range, for a typical tight operating point corresponding to a requirement on the MVA score. A benefit of using a continuous variable to rank jets as being more or less b-like is that multiple operating points of the tagger can be used within the analyses. A typical loose requirement yields a b-tagging efficiency of 80% with a mistag rate of 10%, although some of these jets are also tagged by the tighter requirements. Analyses are constructed out of the exclusive subsets of tagged events.

Its decays, to W + bW \u2212b , can mimic the signal in all of the main search channels: W H \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb, H \u2192 W W ( * ) , ZH \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 bb, W H + ZH \u2192 E / T bb, and others, usually as a result of one or more of the decay products of one or both top quarks falling outside of the detector acceptance or being misreconstructed. The highest-purity tt samples involve more jets than are normally required of the Higgs boson searches, and thus e.g. rejecting events with four or more jets is effective at reducing the tt background in the W H \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb searches. In the H \u2192 W W ( * ) \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bd\u2113 \u2212\u03bd search, the signal is not expected to contain b quarks, and so the b-tag requirement is inverted on reconstructed jets within the acceptance of the silicon detectors in order to reduce the tt background. Full reconstruction of top quarks is rarely needed in order to reject events in which they may be present, particularly in cases in which particles are missing or mismeasured.",

The usual distinguishing feature -the invariant mass of reconstructed candidates, which ought to produce a localized excess in its distribution at the mass of the Higgs boson -is not a powerful enough variable to perform the searches only with it. In H \u2192 bb searches, the dijet mass distribution is wide enough and the expected signal small enough that a noticeable excess would not be seen on top of the background. In the H \u2192 W W ( * ) \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bd\u2113 \u2212\u03bd searches, the invariant mass of the Higgs boson cannot be reconstructed with good resolution due to the missing neutrino momenta. Other variables, such as the transverse momentum of the dijet system, the missing transverse energy, or the angle between the two leptons in the H \u2192 W W ( * ) \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bd\u2113 \u2212\u03bd searches, help provide separation between the signal and the background The relatively large systematic uncertainties in the background predictions would wash out a small potential signal if events were merely counted after applying selection cuts -it is impossible to discover or exclude a signal that is smaller than the uncertainty on the background. Furthermore, if an analysis were to simply select events and count them, different event selection requirements would need to be chosen in order to optimize the analysis for setting limits, making a discovery, and measuring the signal rate. Multivariate analysis techniques provide solutions to these challenges by scoring events according to how signal-like (or background-like) their measured properties are. Higgs boson searches at the Tevatron typically make use of neural networks, [88][89][90] boosted decision trees, 91 and matrix-element techniques. 92,93 Some analyses use several MVA discriminant functions sequentially in order to separate the signal from more than one distinct source of background contamination. Typically, signal and background MC samples are used to train MVA classifier functions, with event samples that are statistically independent from those used to predict the signal and background rates in the subsequent statistical analyses. In some analyses and for some discriminants, data events in background-enriched control samples (in which the signal contribution is expected to be negligible) are used in the background training samples.",

In the most sensitive Higgs boson searches, the signal predictions in the highest-score bins are much larger than the corresponding post-fit background uncertainties. Multiple MVA functions are used in order to separate background contributions from each other in order to reduce the total uncertainty on the background contributions by providing measurements of each component. In order to optimize the sensitivity of the searches, separate MVA functions are trained at each hypothesized value of m H , typically on a grid between 90 GeV and 200 GeV, in steps of 5 GeV. The input variables to the MVA selections are also optimized for each m H value in some analyses.

The methods are chosen to make maximum use of the separation power of the MVA techniques, while at the same time incorporating the effects of systematic uncertainties in the rates, shapes, and independent bin-by-bin uncertainties that arise from limited MC sample (or data control sample) statistics. The inclusion of uncertainties on the shapes of the distributions of complex MVA discriminant variables allays concerns that unmodeled shape distortions can give spurious results if only the rates of contributing signal and background contributions are allowed to vary.

Each independent source of systematic uncertainty is assigned a nuisance parameter, and correlated systematic uncertainties are decomposed by their sources in order to assign independent parameters. The predictions of the yields in each bin for the expected signal and the backgrounds are itemized by process and they depend on the model parameters and the nuisance parameters. Some nuisance parameters, such as the integrated luminosity, scale the predicted yields in each bin of all processes affected by them. In the case of the luminosity, this consists of all processes using theoretical predictions and MC models. Other parameters, such as the jet energy scale in the detector simulation and the QCD factorization and renormalization scale parameters in the event generators affect both the total rates of processes (due to the fraction of events passing the event selection requirements) and also the shapes of the predicted distributions of kinematic variables. Correlations are included by parameterizing all bins and all channels' predictions that are sensitive to a particular systematic effect by the same nuisance parameter. Each process in each bin is also subject to a random, independent uncertainty due to MC (or data from a control sample) statistics and given a separate nuisance parameter.

For every Higgs boson search, the basic strategy involves: (a) selection of the candidate sample, trying to maintain the highest possible acceptance; (b) classification of events into separate categories with different signal-to-background ratio; (c) validation of background predictions in dedicated data control samples; (d) for each category, construction of a variable that is a function of the measured quantities for each event that has the most discrimination between the signal and background, typically involving the use of an MVA discriminant; and (e) test of hypothesis involving the combination of all event categories, including in situ constraints on the dominant systematic uncertainties using high-statistics data control samples.",

The optimized event selections used in the Higgs boson searches often result in the former dominating over the latter. The main physics backgrounds involve the production of a vector boson produced in association with jets (W/Z+jets), single and pair production of top quarks, and diboson (W W , W Z, ZZ) production. Backgrounds from W/Z+jets are typically simulated using MC matrix element generators such as alpgen, 101 allowing the simulation of high parton multiplicities at LO. This includes the generation of samples with extra heavy-flavor quarks, such as W/Zbb+jets and W/Zcc+jets. These samples are interfaced with pythia for further showering and hadronization, and implement the MLM parton-jet matching algorithm 102 to avoid double-counting of radiation between the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower. Backgrounds from top quark pair production are modeled using pythia (CDF) or alpgen+pythia (D\u00d8), while backgrounds from single top quark production are modeled using the madevent 103 (CDF) or singletop 104 (D\u00d8) event generators, both interfaced to pythia. Finally, diboson production is modeled with pythia. The corresponding MC samples are normalized to higher-order theoretical cross sections (typically at NLO or higher). In the case of W/Z+jets events, imperfections in the modeling of the vector boson p T or jet kinematics, or the heavy-flavor content, are corrected using data control samples.",

While identifying a data sample enriched in W/Z+jets is straightforward using W and Z decays into electrons or muons, it is more challenging in the case of Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets owing to the large background from QCD multijet production in such jets+E / T signature. Nevertheless, sophisticated techniques have been developed that allow the effective suppression of the QCD background, making ZH \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdbb one of the most sensitive search channels in the H \u2192 bb decay mode. to the purity and number of b-tagged jets. Samples with more stringent b-tagging requirements are dominated by V +heavy-flavor jets, and in particular V bb, which constitutes an irreducible background. The main discriminating variable between the V H signal and the backgrounds is the dijet invariant mass distribution, which shows a resonant structure around the Higgs boson mass for signal, while it has a smoothly-falling spectrum for background. Therefore, significant efforts have been undertaken to improve the dijet mass resolution (see e.g. Ref. 80). The final step for these searches is to combine a number of kinematic variables into MVA discriminants in order to maximize the sensitivity. A crucial validation of the overall search strategy is provided by the precise measurement of small-cross section backgrounds with the same signature as the signal, such as single top quark and diboson production. Lower-sensitivity searches have also been carried out in the V H and VBF production modes with fully-hadronic final states, as well as in the ttH production mode.

[106][107][108] These searches have much in common with the single top quark searches and subsequent observations and measurements made previously. 93,[109][110][111] Specifically, since the final state contains the same particle content, the backgrounds to both analyses are from the same processes, though the signals have different kinematic properties. The single top quark signal has a higher production cross section and more distinct kinematic properties; the fact that the top quark mass was known precisely also helped. The techniques for search and discovery such as background estimation, cut and MVA optimization, and systematic uncertainty estimation were tested, improved, and validated first in the search for single top quarks and then refined for the Higgs boson analyses. Interestingly, many of the improvements made in the Higgs boson searches, such as the more sophisticated b-taggers, were then propagated back into the final single top results. [112][113][114][115][116][117][118] Candidate events are selected requiring a single isolated lepton (e or \u00b5), large E / T and two or three jets in the event, at least one of which is required to be b-tagged. Lepton selections are kept as loose as possible in order to maximize acceptance, requiring the development of sophisticated techniques to suppress the QCD multijet background, leaving a sample dominated by background events containing real leptonic W decays. In both the CDF and D\u00d8 analyses, events are categorized into different channels depending on the jet multiplicity (2 or 3 jets) and the number and purity (\"loose\" (L) or \"tight\" (T)) of b-tagged jets. As a result, the CDF analysis considers five b-tagging categories (TT, TL, LL, T, L) for the 2-jet sample and two categories (TT, TL) for the 3-jet sample, while the D\u00d8 analysis considers four categories (TT, TL, LL, T) and two categories (LL, T), respectively. Channels with two b-tagged jets are enriched in W bb, tt and single top backgrounds, while channels with one b-tagged jet are dominated by W +light or charm jets, and contain also sizable QCD multijet contributions. For each of the analysis channels, optimized MVA discriminants are trained against the corresponding backgrounds, considering a number of kinematic distributions, in addition to the dijet mass. Figure 2 shows examples of the inclusive dijet mass distribution (summed over all analysis channels) and the final MVA discriminant in the most sensitive channel of the D\u00d8 search. The observed (expected) cross section limits at m H = 125 GeV for the CDF and D\u00d8 analyses are 4.9 (2.8) and 5.2 (4.7) times the SM prediction, respectively.",

Lepton selections are kept as efficient as possible in order to maximize acceptance, since after the requirement that the two leptons form a Z boson candidate, background from misidentified leptons is negligible. In any case, events are categorized according to the quality of the identified leptons. Similarly to the W H analysis, different event categories are defined based on jet and b-tag multiplicities, and on b-tag purity requirements. The CDF analysis considers four b-tagging categories (TT, TL, LL, T) for both the 2-jet and 3-jet samples, while the D\u00d8 analysis considers two categories (TL, T) for both the 2-jet and 3-jet samples. The absence of E / T in the event allows for improved invariant mass resolution by imposing event-wide transverse momentum constraints: in the case of the CDF analysis corrections to the jet energies are performed via a dedicated NN relating the measured jet energies and directions to the E / T vector on an event-by-event basis; in the case of the D\u00d8 analysis an improved measurement of the jet energy is obtained from a kinematic fit imposing constraints on the dilepton mass to be consistent with the Z boson mass and that the missing transverse momentum of the leptons-plus-jets system should be consistent with zero. A sophisticated MVA strategy is followed whereby different MVA discriminants are trained to separate the signal from the different backgrounds (Z+jets, tt and diboson), one at a time. The observed (expected) cross section limits at m H = 125 GeV for the CDF and D\u00d8 analyses are 7.1 (3.9) and 7.1 (5.1) times the SM prediction, respectively.",

About half of the signal events in this channel originate from W H \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb with the charged lepton not identified, hence the name W H, ZH \u2192 E / T bb given to this search. As the previous V H(\u2192 bb) searches, different event categories are defined based on b-tag multiplicity and purity requirements: the CDF analysis considers three b-tagging categories (TT, TL, T), while the D\u00d8 analysis considers two categories which are defined by requirements on the sum of the b-tagging output variables for the two taggable jets in the event. The large QCD multijet background with spurious E / T is effectively suppressed via MVA discriminants that exploit information of the E / T as measured by the calorimeter and by the tracker, including the correlation between their directions in the transverse plane and with respect to the directions of the jets. As a result, after final selection the QCD multijet background can be made comparable or significantly smaller than the physics background, dominated by V +heavy-flavor and tt. For each of the analyzed samples, MVA discriminants are trained between the signal and all backgrounds. The observed (expected) cross section limits at m H = 125 GeV for the CDF and D\u00d8 analyses are 3.1 (3.3) and 4.3 (3.9) times the SM prediction, respectively. taking into account the LEE, thus representing the first evidence for the presence of a particle produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to bb. Since then, the CDF W H, ZH \u2192 E / T bb result was updated 123 to use a more powerful MVA b-tagging algorithm along with changes in the kinematic selections, resulting in a statistical fluctuation that slightly reduced the significance of the excess. The measured combined cross section times branching ratio at m H = 125 GeV from the updated combination 13 is (\u03c3 W H + \u03c3 ZH ) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 bb) = 0.19 +0.08 \u22120.09 (stat + syst) pb, about 1.5 times larger than the SM prediction at the same mass. Results from the combination of H \u2192 bb searches with the rest of search channels are provided in Sec. 4.8.",

This process has the same signature as the signals of interest, including the feature of a resonance in the bb invariant mass spectrum. While the SM prediction for the cross section for V Z(\u2192 bb) is about six times larger than for the Higgs boson signal, this process is affected by larger background from V +jets owing to the lower invariant mass of the bb system compared to the V H signal. Exactly the same analyses as for the Higgs boson search are used for this measurement, with the only difference being that MVA discriminants are trained considering V Z as the signal of interest, and potential contributions from Higgs boson production are not considered. The measured cross section from the combination of CDF and D\u00d8 analyses 13 is \u03c3 V Z = 3.0\u00b10.6 (stat.)\u00b10.7 (syst.) pb, in good agreement with SM prediction of 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 pb. 126 Individual measurements by the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations 127,128 are also found to be consistent with the SM prediction.

Searches for H +X \u2192 \u2113\u03c4 h +jets are sensitive to the main Higgs boson production mechanisms, gg \u2192 H, V H and VBF, and to both H \u2192 W W ( * ) and H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays. The D\u00d8 search 132 uses 9.7 fb \u22121 of data and requires an electron or muon, a \u03c4 h and at least two jets, while the CDF search, 133 which uses 6 fb \u22121 of data, considers in addition events with exactly one jet. The dominant backgrounds in these searches originate from W/Z+jets, tt and QCD multijet backgrounds. Multivariate techniques are employed to separate signal from background by making use of a large number of kinematic variables. In the case of the D\u00d8 analysis, a BDT trained to distinguish between H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and H \u2192 W W ( * ) signals is used to define \u03c4 \u03c4 -and W W -dominated samples, which are analyzed separately for decay mode-specific limits, or in combination assuming the SM prediction for the ratio of H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and H \u2192 W W ( * ) branching ratios. The most restrictive limit for the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode is obtained by the D\u00d8 \u03c4 \u03c4 -specific discriminant, yielding an observed (expected) cross section limit at m H = 125 GeV of 12.8 (10.4) times the SM prediction.

Backgrounds are estimated using a combination of MC simulations and data-driven techniques. In the case of backgrounds with real leptons and true E / T from neutrinos, the MC simulation is used.

One of the most sensitive kinematic variables is the angular separation between the two charged leptons, either in two dimensions (\u2206\u03c6(\u2113 + , \u2113 \u2212 )) or three dimensions (\u2206R(\u2113 + , \u2113 \u2212 )), since the spin-zero nature of the Higgs boson causes the leptons to be produced closer to each other on average than is the case for the background. For the same reason, the dilepton invariant mass distribution shows good discrimination between signal and background (see Fig. 5(a)). In order to optimize the search sensitivity, events are categorized into different analysis channels with different signal-to-background ratio and background composition, and optimized MVA discriminants are defined and trained for each of them. Both CDF and D\u00d8 categorize events according to the number of jets, with the 0-jet channel primarily probing the gg \u2192 H production mechanism and the 1-jet and 2-jet channels being more sensitive to V H and VBF production. Categories are also defined based on the lepton quality (CDF) or lepton flavor (D\u00d8). An example of the MVA discriminant for the single highest-sensitivity channel in the CDF analysis, requiring exactly 0 jets and high-purity leptons, is shown in Fig. 5(b), demonstrating the good separation between signal and background achieved. The D\u00d8 analysis further categorizes events with exactly 0 or 1 jets according to an MVA discriminant designed to separate W W -like events (including both H \u2192 W W ( * ) signal and non-resonant W W background) from non-W W events. The CDF analysis also considers a separate channel for events with dilepton invariant mass below 16 GeV. Finally, searches for H \u2192 W W ( * ) \u2192 e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h + \u2264 1 jets have also been performed. 132,134 ",

The prescription of Ref. 146 is followed, where the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions are modified by a multiplicative factor \u03ba f , to the vector bosons W and Z by \u03ba V when tested together assuming custodial symmetry, and by \u03ba W and \u03ba Z when tested separately. For each value of the \u03ba coupling modifiers, a new set of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching ratios is computed starting with the SM predictions and modifying each component diagram by the relevant combination of coupling modifiers. For example, the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 width contains a contribution scaled by \u03ba f due to the top-quark and b-quark loops, and a contribution with the opposite sign in the amplitude coming from the W -boson loop.

The SM Higgs associated production is an swave process and its cross section rises proportional to \u03b2 close to threshold, where \u03b2 = 2p/ \u221a s, with p being the magnitude of the three-momentum of the Higgs boson (or the vector boson) in the V H rest frame, and \u221a s being the total energy of the V H system. 148 Associated production of a 0 \u2212 boson is a p-wave process with a cross section that scales as \u03b2 3 , and associated production of a graviton-like 2 a d-wave process with a cross section that scales as \u03b2 5 . The distribution of the invariant mass of the V X system, where X is either the SM Higgs boson or one of the exotic Higgs-like particles proposed, is therefore quite different, with a much larger average value for the 2 + particle than for the 0 \u2212 particle, with the smallest average value for the SM Higgs boson production. The processes V X \u2192 V bb are used to test for the presence of these exotic bosons, and the observable m V bb is a strong discriminant among the possible signals and also the background processes. Since there is no prediction for the cross section of V X production for the J P = 0 \u2212 and J P = 2 + particles, nor for the decay branching fractions, the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations treated this search as a test for an exotic new particle which may either replace the SM Higgs boson or be present along with it.",

Both collaborations compute p-values for excluding the exotic signals, assuming that the production rates and decay branching fractions are the same for the exotic X bosons as for the SM Higgs boson, obtaining exclusions well in excess of the 95% C.L. assuming this production rate. 14,15 The CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations have combined the results of these analyses to produce the strongest constraints on these models of exotic bosons. 16 The observed (expected) upper limit on 2 + boson production is 0.36 (0.33) times the rate predicted for SM Higgs boson production, and the upper limit on 0 \u2212 boson production is also 0.36 (0.32) times the SM Higgs boson rate, both assuming that the SM Higgs boson is absent and is replaced with an exotic particle.

Radiative corrections introduce additional dependencies on other model parameters. At large tan \u03b2, one of the CP-even Higgs bosons (h or H) is approximately degenerate in mass with the A boson.

Also, the inclusive \u03c6 production is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion (gg \u2192 \u03c6, with the b quark playing a potentially important role in the loop) and bb \u2192 \u03c6. The latter process may produce a b quark in the detector acceptance, via gb \u2192 \u03c6b, which provides an important experimental handle to suppress backgrounds. The CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations have searched for \u03c6 \u2192 bb and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in both inclusive and b\u03c6 production modes. A summary of the main features of these searches and their results is provided below.",

Therefore, these searches are performed in the associated production mode, b\u03c6 \u2192 bbb, resulting in a signature with at least three b jets in the final state, with the third b jet requirement providing additional rejection against the QCD multijet background. Both CDF and D\u00d8 searches employ multijet triggers including b-tagging requirements. After selecting an offline sample with at least three b-tagged jets, the final discriminating variable is the invariant mass of the Higgs boson candidate, defined based on either the two leading b-tagged jets (CDF) or the pairing that maximizes a likelihood-ratio discriminant variable (D\u00d8) (see Fig. 13(a)). In the case of the D\u00d8 analysis, the likelihood-ratio discriminant is also used to reject events for which no pairing satisfies a given threshold value, a requirement that helps to further suppress the background. worth noting that these constraints are strongly dependent on higher-order radiative corrections, a feature not shared by searches for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , owing to cancellations between radiative corrections affecting the production and decay processes. This makes both searches complementary since their combination could shed light on the nature of a possible signal.",

Much more sensitive searches were carried out by the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations during Run II, using up to 1.8 fb \u22121 and 7.3 fb \u22121 of data, respectively. [160][161][162][163] Events were selected requiring one or two tau candidates to decay leptonically (excluding ee and \u00b5\u00b5 final states, which suffer from very large background from Z/\u03b3 * production), resulting in final states denoted as \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h and \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u00b5 . The CDF analysis 160 and early D\u00d8 analyses 161 considered the three channels, while the final D\u00d8 analyses 162,163 were restricted to the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h channel, which dominates the sensitivity. While all previous Tevatron searches were focused on the inclusive production mode gg, bb \u2192 \u03c6, the final D\u00d8 analysis considered both the inclusive and gb \u2192 \u03c6b associated production modes, by defining two non-overlapping analysis channels without and with the requirement of an additional b-tagged jet, referred to as \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h b, respectively. In the case of the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h channel, the main background originates from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , followed by QCD multijet and W +jets production where one of the jets is misidentified as a hadronic tau. The main discriminating variable used is the ditau invariant mass, denoted as M hat , defined from the four-momenta of the two leptons and the E / T , in such a way that it represents the minimum centerof-mass energy consistent with the decay of a ditau resonance (see Fig. 14(a)). In the case of the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h b channel, there are large backgrounds from Z/\u03b3 * +jets, tt and QCD multijets. Dedicated MVA discriminants are used to reject the tt and QCD multijets backgrounds, as well as to discriminate signal from the remaining total background. No significant excess above the SM expectation is found in either of the channels, and constraints in the (tan \u03b2,m A ) plane in different MSSM benchmark scenarios are derived. Both channels have comparable reach, with the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h b channel being somewhat more sensitive at lower m A , owing to the reduced background from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 by the b-tagging requirement. Figure 14(b) shows the combination of the D\u00d8 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h b channels and the b\u03c6 \u2192 bbb search, 157 although the contribution of the latter was very small and strongly dependent on the MSSM parameters assumed.",

On the one hand, a light CP-odd Higgs boson is a potential axion candidate. On the other hand, it can have significant phenomenological implications in the study of an extended Higgs sector: e.g. it can appear in the decay of the SMlike Higgs boson (h \u2192 aa), or become a dominant decay mode for a light charged Higgs boson (H \u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1( * ) a).",

The use of machine learning techniques and the splitting of data samples into multiple categories with different sensitivities improved the statistical power of the searches. The impact of systematic uncertainties on the results yielded by these new methods was evaluated with techniques common in high-energy physics experiments -validation using control samples and sidebands, as well as propagation of uncertainties in all predictions through the multivariate techniques while handling correlations and uncertainties in the distributions of observable variables. Standard statistical techniques were used to extract final results. These same techniques have been adopted in searches for many new phenomena at the Tevatron and the LHC, as well as measurements of newly established phenomena, such as single top quark production, diboson production, and Higgs boson production.",
