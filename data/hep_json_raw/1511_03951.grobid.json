The study is based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 fb \u22121 . The search for t\u03b3 events where t \u2192 Wb and W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd is conducted in final states with a muon, a photon, at least one hadronic jet with at most one being consistent with originating from a bottom quark, and missing transverse momentum. No evidence of single top quark production in association with a photon through a FCNC is observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the tu\u03b3 and tc\u03b3 anomalous couplings and translated into upper limits on the branching fraction of the FCNC top quark decays: B(t \u2192 u\u03b3) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(t \u2192 c\u03b3) < 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Upper limits are also set on the cross section of associated t\u03b3 production in a restricted phase-space region. These are the most stringent limits currently available.",

Within the SM, top quark FCNC transitions are extremely suppressed by the GIM mechanism [1]. The predicted branching fraction (B) for t \u2192 u\u03b3 and t \u2192 c\u03b3 decays are approximately 10 \u221214 [2]. However, an enhancement of several orders of magnitude is predicted in some extensions of the SM, resulting in branching fractions observable at the LHC in some cases [3,4]. Therefore, observation of these rare top quark decay modes would be indicative of physics beyond the SM.",

In this paper, we examine the associated production of a single top quark and a photon, which is sensitive to the anomalous tq\u03b3 FCNC coupling. The difference between quarks and antiquarks in the parton distribution functions (PDF) of the proton in the presence of a finite tu\u03b3 coupling leads to an asymmetry between top and anti-top quark production rates. No asymmetry is expected for tc\u03b3, because of the similar charm and anti-charm quark contents in the proton. This would allow a distinction between the tu\u03b3 and tc\u03b3 signal scenarios if these processes were observed [11]. Better sensitivity to the tu\u03b3 coupling is expected because the up quark PDF in the proton is larger than that of the charm quark.",

To take into account the uncertainties coming from the theoretical predictions of the cross sections for the simulated backgrounds, the individual cross sections are each varied by \u00b130% [37][38][39] and the differences in the fitted results with respect to the nominal fit are added in quadrature.",

Events with a reconstructed top quark mass in the sideband region defined as m \u00b5\u03bdb > 220 GeV or m \u00b5\u03bdb < 130 GeV are used to obtain the W\u03b3 + jets distributions. The sideband region is enriched in W\u03b3 + jets, with about 35% contamination from other background sources. This contamination is subtracted using an estimate from data for the W + jets contribution and MC predictions for the remaining background sources.

In events without a matched b jet, the jet with the largest p T is used to reconstruct the decayed top quark. The p T of the neutrinos is calculated as the magnitude of the vector sum of the p T of each neutrino in the event, except those originating from hadron decays.

Both the normalization and the distribution in the sum of all other backgrounds, i.e., the b and B(x NN ) terms, are obtained from simulation.

The numbers of W + jets and W\u03b3 + jets events are determined from the fit to the NN output distribution.The fit results are taken as central values for the analysis, and are assigned uncertainties that reflect the differences obtained when varying the control region definition.
