The coupling can be obtained through measurement of the top quark pair-associated Higgs boson production cross-section. Of the multiple challenges arising in this cross-section measurement, we investigate the reconstruction of the partons originating from the hard scattering process using the measured jets in simulated ttH events. The task corresponds to an assignment challenge of m objects (jets) to n other objects (partons), where m \u2265 n. We compare several methods with emphasis on a concept based on deep learning techniques which yields the best results with more than 50% of correct jet-parton assignments.",

Various network designs have been successfully applied to extract a simulated, new exotic particle or Higgs boson signal from a background-dominated data sample [10][11][12], to identify the underlying parton flavor of a jet or to measure jet substructure [13,14], and to reconstruct the neutrino flavor in neutrino-nucleus interactions [15].",

The BDT method is illustrated by the dashed green curve which on average yields \u2206R values that are too large. The \u03c7 2 method (dashed blue curve) on average returns \u2206R values that are too small. Figure 5b shows distributions of the azimuthal angular distance of the two jets of the W boson decay with a similar quality in the description for the BDT and neural network methods but worse for the \u03c7 2 method. The reconstructed mass of the Higgs boson can be seen in Figure 5c.
