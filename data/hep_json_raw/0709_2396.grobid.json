Assuming a one-photon production mechanism, this VV (\u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 ) final state is described by three helicity amplitudes. A study of this reaction can then provide an experimental test of QCD at the amplitude level [14] [13] through investigation of the final states angular correlations. This analysis uses 343 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 colliding beam data collected on the \u03a5(4S) resonance at \u221a s = 10.58 GeV and 36 fb \u22121 collected 40 MeV lower. Events with exactly two well-reconstructed, oppositely charged tracks identified as pions and at least two well-reconstructed \u03c0 0 s are selected. We fit BABAR Preliminary Fig. 4.

From the two dimensional mass fit (\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), we can calculate a \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 signal sWeight [17] for each event (including those events outside the defined \u03c1 \u00b1 mass window) and use it to produce signal angular distributions. We fit the five angular distributions to Equs. 2, 3 and 4 simultaneously by minimizing \u03c7 2 . The correlations among the five angles are neglected; this is justified by means of fits to events generated according the assumed PDFs (toy MC). We normalize the amplitudes such that |F 00 | 2 + 4|F 10 | 2 + 2|F 11 | 2 = 1 since we have 1 F 00 , 4 F 10 and 2 F 11 amplitude contributions. The normalized amplitudes from the fit are found to be in the ratio: |F 00 | 2 : |F 10 | 2 : |F 11 | 2 = 0.51 \u00b1 0.14(stat) \u00b1 0.02(syst) : 0.10 \u00b1 0.04(stat) \u00b1 0.01(syst) : 0.04 \u00b1 0.03(stat) \u00b1 0.00(syst), and |F 00 | 2 deviates from 1 with significance more than 3 sigma. This disagrees with a QCD prediction [14], and suggests that either the decay is not dominated by single-photon exchange as naively expected, or that the QCD prediction does not apply to data in our energy region. The final radiation-corrected cross section for 0.5 < m \u03c1 \u00b1 < 1.1 GeV/c 2 , and within | cos \u03b8 * | < 0.8, | cos \u03b8 \u00b1 | < 0.85, at near \u221a s = 10.58 GeV (assuming only one-photon production) is: \u03c3 fid (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 ) = 8.5 \u00b1 0.7(stat) \u00b1 1.5(syst) fb.",
