            "text": "A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons and a photon is described. Higgs boson decays to a Z boson and a photon (H \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3, = e or \u00b5), or to two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a muon pair (H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3) were considered. The analysis is performed using a data set recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No significant excess above the background prediction has been found. Limits are set on the cross section for a standard model Higgs boson decaying to opposite-sign electron or muon pairs and a photon. The observed limits on cross section times the corresponding branching fractions vary between 1.4 and 4.0 (6.1 and 11.4) times the standard model cross section for H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 (H \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3) in the 120-130 GeV mass range of the \u03b3 system. The H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 and H \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 analyses are combined for m H = 125 GeV, obtaining an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 3.9 (2.0) times the standard model cross section.",

            "text": "Measurements of rare decays of the Higgs boson, such as H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 and H \u2192 Z\u03b3, would enhance our understanding of the standard model (SM) of particle physics, and allow us to probe exotic couplings introduced by possible extensions of the SM [1][2][3][4]. The decay width can be modified by the theories involving heavy fermions, gauge bosons or charged scalars [5][6][7][8][9]. Simple extensions of the SM like two Higgs doublet models, or the minimal supersymmetric standard model also exhibit similar features [10]. Certain coefficients of the dimension-6 extension of the standard model effective field theory can be constrained by measuring the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 branching ratio precisely [11]. As an example, a model [10] which includes a hypercharge zero triplet extension, shows a modification in B(H \u2192 Z\u03b3), with respect to the SM value, of about 10% for an additional scalar field with mass between 0 and 400 GeV.",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, 13 m in length and 6 m in diameter, which provides an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume there are several particle detection systems. Charged-particle trajectories are measured by silicon pixel and silicon strip trackers, covering 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity. A lead-tungstate crystal ECAL and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL) surround the tracking volume and cover the region |\u03b7| < 3. They provide energy measurements of photons, electrons and hadronic jets. The ECAL is partitioned into a barrel region with |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| = 3. A lead and silicon-strip preshower detector is located in front of the endcap of the ECAL. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction.",

            "text": "A variable R 9 is defined as the energy sum of the 3\u00d73 ECAL crystals centered on the most energetic crystal in the supercluster divided by the energy of the supercluster. The selected events are separated into four mutually exclusive event classes based on the R 9 and \u03b7 of the photon and the presence of jets. An R 9 value of 0.94 is used to separate the reconstructed photons into two regions. The region containing unconverted photons, with larger values of R 9 and better energy resolution, has a smaller background. By separating events into two regions of low/high R 9 value, the sensitivity of the analysis is increased. We therefore have the following four categories: events that require the presence of at least two jets passing the selection criteria as described below; photon in the ECAL barrel (EB) region with a high R 9 value; photon in the barrel with low R 9 value; and photon in the ECAL endcap (EE) regions. Only events that do not pass the dijet tag are included in the EB or EE classes. By using this event classification scheme, as opposed to combining all events into one class, the sensitivity of this analysis is increased by 11%.",

A lepton-tag class contains events with an additional electron (or muon) with p T > 7 (5) GeV, to target Higgs boson production in association with either a Z or W boson. Events not included in the lepton class are considered for the dijet class. In this case the criteria described in section 3.1 are used to select events containing a dijet, targeting Higgs boson production in a VBF process. The next class considered is the boosted class, which requires that the p T of the \u03b3 system is greater than 60 GeV in order to enhance the fraction of events that contain a Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson recoiling against a jet. Events that do not fall into these three classes are placed in the untagged categories. A significant fraction of the signal events are expected to have the photon and both leptons in the barrel, while only a sixth of the signal events have the photon in the endcap. This is in contrast to the background, where about one third of the events are expected to have a photon in the endcap. Furthermore, events where the photon does not convert to e + e \u2212 have a smaller fraction of background events and better energy resolution. For these reasons, the untagged events are classified into four categories according to the pseudorapidity of the leptons and photon, and the R 9 value of the photon.

The background is estimated from data and the signal is estimated using the simulation. Even though the background is estimated from data, simulated samples are used in the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 search to optimize the event classes. The main background, pp \u2192 Z\u03b3, is generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator [33]. The Z( )+jets events with a jet misidentified as a photon are another important source of background and are generated at NLO using MadGraph5 amc@nlo. The NLO parton distribution function (PDF) set, NNPDF3.0 [34], and the CUETP8M1 [35] underlying event tune are used to generate these samples. All background events are interfaced with pythia 8.205 [36,37] for the fragmentation and hadronization of partons. Signal samples for the H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 produced via ggH, VBF, and VH processes are simulated at NLO with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.3.3, with the Higgs boson characterization framework [38,39]. The ttH production mechanism gives a negligible contribution to the signal and is therefore ignored. For the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 process, the simulated events from all four production mechanisms are generated at NLO using powheg v2.0 [40,41] event tune for hadronization and fragmentation. The NLO PDF set, NNPDF3.0, is used to produce these samples. The SM Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions recommended by the LHC Higgs cross section working group [14] are used for H \u2192 Z\u03b3, whereas for H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 the Higgs boson production cross sections are also taken from ref. [14], but the branching fraction of H \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 is taken from the mcfm calculation and given in eq. ( 1.1). The simulated signal and background events are reweighted by taking into account the difference between data and simulated events so that the distribution of pileup vertices, the trigger efficiencies, the resolution, the energy scale, the reconstruction efficiencies, and the isolation efficiency -for electrons, muons, and photons -observed in data are reproduced. An additional correction is applied to photons to reproduce the performance of the R 9 shower shape variable.",
