All other uncertainties are included in a bin-by-bin fashion. A constant uncertainty of 0.35% has been determined for each charged track with p t > 0.2 GeV/c. Tracks below that threshold have to be treated differently depending on the track momentum [39]. The uncertainty on the number of produced B-meson pairs is 1.4%. The uncertainty due to the K L veto is determined by vary-ing the K L efficiency by its uncertainty. The branching fractions of the dominant backgrounds are varied by their errors stated in Ref. [23] to determine the effect on the MC prediction. The uncertainty on the correction factor of the tagside reconstruction is determined in Ref. [19] and applied to the samples. The discrepancy between inclusive and exclusive |V ub | measurements has been included as a flat but asymmetric uncertainty in the B \u2192 X u \u2113\u03bd sample of ( +5 \u221215 )%. An uncertainty of \u00b110% is applied to the branching fractions in the MC sample of rare b \u2192 s and other rare B decays. Additionally, decays of type B \u2192 X u \u03c4 \u03bd are present in the final event selection. The contribution to the E ECL distribution is evaluated from the MC sample assuming a B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and found to be small; a relative uncertainty of \u00b150% is applied. Statistical uncertainties in the PDF shape due to finite MC sample size are included in a way similar to the approach by Barlow and Beeston [40]. Instead of using one Poisson constraint per background sample per bin per \u03c4 decay channel, only one constraint term per bin per channel is used. The uncertainty introduced by this approximation is negligible for bins with non-vanishing content and reduces the amount of computation time needed. Instead of the finite MC uncertainty, the fit error is included as a systematic uncertainty for the dominant b \u2192 c contribution. The theoretical uncertainties of the signal form factors f + and f 0 are included by generating additional signal MC with one form factor fixed and the other varied by its 1\u03c3 uncertainty. The relative uncertainties determined in this way are combined into a single uncertainty estimate. The systematic uncertainties due to the tracking efficiency and particle identification affect only the overall efficiency and are only included in the calculation of the upper limit. The relative effect on the branching fraction is determined by repeatedly fitting modified PDFs to data. The PDFs are modified by replacing each background contribution with the respective contribution where the systematic effect is applied. For each systematic uncertainty, two fits are performed for the positive and negative deviation. The maximum, absolute deviation is quoted in Table II.",
