            "text": "Searches for new heavy resonances decaying to W W , W Z, and ZZ bosons are presented, using a data sample corresponding to 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Analyses selecting \u03bd\u03bdqq, \u03bdqq, qq and qqqq final states are combined, searching for a narrow-width resonance with mass between 500 and 3000 GeV. The discriminating variable is either an invariant mass or a transverse mass. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. Three benchmark models are tested: a model predicting the existence of a new heavy scalar singlet, a simplified model predicting a heavy vector-boson triplet, and a bulk Randall-Sundrum model with a heavy spin-2 graviton. Cross-section limits are set at the 95% confidence level and are compared to theoretical cross-section predictions for a variety of models. The data exclude a scalar singlet with mass below 2650 GeV, a heavy vector-boson triplet with mass below 2600 GeV, and a graviton with mass below 1100 GeV. These results significantly extend the previous limits set using pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

            "text": "Diboson resonances are predicted in several extensions to the Standard Model (SM), such as composite Higgs models [1,2], technicolour [3][4][5], warped extra dimensions [6][7][8], Two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [9], and Grand Unified Theories [10][11][12][13]. The search for high-mass resonances decaying into vector bosons benefits greatly from the increase in centre-of-mass energy of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from \u221a s = 8 TeV (Run 1) to 13 TeV (Run 2). This would result in more abundant production of new particles with masses significantly in excess of a TeV, in processes initiated by gg, gq or qq. 1 This paper reports a search for a charged or neutral resonant state, with a mass between 500 GeV and 3 TeV, decaying to W W , ZZ or W Z bosons, with subsequent decays of the W and Z bosons to quarks or leptons. Four different decay modes are considered: the fully hadronic mode (qqqq), and the semileptonic modes ( qq, \u03bdqq and \u03bd\u03bdqq). Decays of the W or Z bosons to quarks are reconstructed as single jets with a large radius parameter. These jets are required to have features characteristic of a two-body decay, and are identified as W or Z bosons using the jet mass and jet substructure [14,15].",

The first is an extension of the SM with an additional heavy, CP-even, scalar singlet decaying to longitudinally polarised bosons [16]. The second is the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) parameterisation [17], predicting W \u2192 W Z and Z \u2192 W W processes. The third model, known as a bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) graviton model, features a spin-2 graviton (G * ) decaying to W W or ZZ. The G * is the first Kaluza-Klein mode in a RS model [6,18] with a warped extra dimension with curvature \u03ba, where the SM fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk of the extra dimension [19][20][21].",

As an example, CMS set a lower limit of 1.7 TeV at the 95% confidence level (CL) on the mass of a W boson predicted by an Extended Gauge Model (EGM) [32] using the fully hadronic channel [26]. The qqqq, qq, \u03bdqq channels were combined by ATLAS using the bulk RS G * model and the EGM W boson as benchmarks [31]. Observed lower limits at 95% CL of 1.81 TeV on the EGM W mass and of 810 GeV on the bulk G * mass were obtained, assuming \u03ba/M Pl = 1 (whereM Pl is the reduced Planck mass) for the bulk G * signal hypothesis.

The measurement of the integrated luminosity is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref.

The data are required to satisfy a number of conditions ensuring that the detector was operating well while the data were recorded.",

Results are then interpreted within a model of a CP-even scalar singlet S [16]. The model is parameterised by: an energy scale \u039b = 1 TeV; a coefficient c H scaling the coupling of S to the Higgs boson; and a coefficient c 3 scaling the coupling of S to gluons. Two benchmark scenarios are considered, one in which c 3 is set via naive dimensional analysis (NDA) to be c 3 = (1/4\u03c0) 2 , with c H = 0.9; and another in which the coupling to gluons is Unsuppressed and c 3 = 1/8\u03c0, with c H = 0.5. The value of c 3 determines the production cross-section and the decay width to gluons, while decays to W or Z bosons account for the remaining decay width. In the Unsuppressed scenario considered in this paper, the total branching ratio to W W , ZZ or HH increases from 59% at 500 GeV, to 70% at 2 TeV and to 73% at 5 TeV. For the NDA scenario, this branching ratio is always above 99%. The ratio of W W :ZZ:HH partial widths is approximately 2:1:1 in both scenarios, and couplings to fermions and transversely polarised bosons are set to zero.",

The Lagrangian parameterises the couplings of the new HVT with the SM fields in a generic manner. This parameterisation allows a large class of models to be described, in which the new triplet field mixes with the SM vector bosons. The coupling between the new triplet and the SM fermions is given by the combination of parameters g 2 c F /g V , where g is the SM SU(2) L gauge coupling, c F is a multiplicative factor that modifies the coupling to fermions, and g V represents the coupling strength of the known W and Z bosons to the new vector bosons. Similarly, the coupling between the Higgs boson and the new triplet is given by the combination g V c H , where c H is a multiplicative factor that modifies the coupling to the Higgs boson. Other coupling parameters involving more than one heavy vector boson give negligible contributions to the overall cross-sections for the processes of interest here. Two benchmarks are used [17]. In the first one, referred to as model-A with g V = 1, the branching ratios of the new HVT to fermions and gauge bosons are similar to those predicted by some extensions of the SM gauge group [39]. This model, although severely constrained by searches for new resonances decaying to leptons [40][41][42][43], is included because",

For the HVT interpretation, samples are generated according to model A, for resonance masses ranging from 0.5 TeV to 3 TeV for the semileptonic channels and from 1.2 TeV to 3 TeV for the fully hadronic search. Interpretation in the HVT model-B, g V = 3 scenario uses the model A signal samples rescaled to the predicted cross-sections from model-B. For the bulk RS graviton model, the curvature scale parameter \u03ba/M Pl is assumed to be 1. Table 1 shows the resonance width and the product of cross-sections and branching ratios for the various models. MC samples are used to model the shape and normalisation of the relevant kinematic distributions for most SM background processes in the \u03bd\u03bdqq, \u03bdqq and qq searches. Events containing W or Z bosons with associated jets are simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 [54] generator. Matrix elements (ME) are calculated for up to two partons at NLO and four partons at leading order (LO) using the Comix [55] and OpenLoops [56] ME generators. They are merged with the Sherpa parton shower (PS) [57] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [58]. The CT10 PDF set is used in conjunction with a dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. For the generation of topantitop pairs (tt) and single top-quarks in the W t-and s-channels the POWHEG BOX v2 [48,59,60] generator with the CT10 PDF set is used. Electroweak (t-channel) singletop-quark events are generated using the POWHEG BOX v1 generator. This generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO ME calculations together with the four-flavour PDF set CT10f4 [49]. For all top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations are preserved; for t-channel production, top-quarks are decayed using MadSpin [61]. The parton shower, fragmentation, and the underlying event are simulated using Pythia 6.428 [62] with the CTEQ6L1 [63] PDF sets and the set of tuned parameters known as the \"Perugia JHEP09(2016)173  Table 1.

The acceptance times efficiency is estimated with respect to the branching ratio of the signal benchmarks to the specific diboson final state and takes into account the W and Z boson branching ratios.

Specifically, it is required that either both jets have a mass in the range 110-140 GeV and there are less than two b-tagged track-jets matched by ghost-association to either jet, or that one jet has a mass in the range 110-140 GeV and the other in the range 50-65 GeV.

Both figures represent background-only fits to the data. The total yields in the different signal and control regions for the HVT W Z channel are also shown in table 5. Good agreement is found between the data and the background-only hypothesis. The most significant excess over the expected background is observed in the scalar selection for a mass of 1.6 TeV, with a p-value equivalent to a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations. Upper limits at the 95% CL are set on the production cross-section times the branching ratio of new resonances decaying to diboson final states. Figure 4 shows the observed and expected 95% CL model-independent limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio of a narrow-width scalar resonance, as a function of its mass, in the W W and ZZ channels combined. The constraints are compared with the CP-even scalar singlet model described in section 3, for the NDA and Unsuppressed scenarios. Masses below 2650 GeV are excluded for the Unsuppressed scenario. Figure 5 shows the exclusion contours in the (c H /\u039b, c 3 /\u039b) parameter space, derived from the crosssection limits for three sample masses.

The \"Top quark\" distribution includes both the tt and single-top-quark backgrounds. The upper panels show the distribution of the observed data and estimated backgrounds as a function of the analysis discriminants. The observed data are shown as points, solid colours represent the different background contributions and the shaded bands reflect the systematic uncertainties in the estimated background. The lower panels show the ratio of the observed data to the estimated background as a function of the analysis discriminant. The decay modes \"W W \", \"ZZ\", or \"V V \" indicate the mass requirements placed on the hadronically decaying boson, where a \"W \" or \"Z\" indicates a narrow mass window around the corresponding boson mass, and a \"V \" indicates the wider mass window including both the W and Z boson masses.
