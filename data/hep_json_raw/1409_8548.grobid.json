            "text": "A number of BSM scenarios predict LFV at branching fractions approaching current experimental sensitivities [4], with LFV in \u03c4 \u2212 decays often enhanced with respect to \u00b5 \u2212 decays due to the large difference in mass between the two leptons (the inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout). If charged LFV were to be discovered, measurements of the branching fractions for a number of channels would be required to determine the nature of the BSM physics. In the absence of such a discovery, improving the experimental constraints on the branching fractions for LFV decays would help to constrain the parameter spaces of BSM models. This paper reports on an updated search for the LFV decay \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with the LHCb experiment [5] at the CERN LHC. The previous LHCb analysis of this channel produced the first result on a search for LFV \u03c4 \u2212 decays at a hadron collider [6]. Using 1.0 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, a limit was set on the branching fraction, B (\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90% confidence JHEP02(2015)121 level (CL). The current best experimental upper limits are B (\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90% CL from Belle [7] and B (\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90% CL from BaBar [8]. In the analysis presented here, an additional LHCb data set, corresponding to 2.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected at 8 TeV, is added to the previous data set, and a number of new analysis techniques are introduced.",

            "text": "The multivariate classifier M 3body is based on the geometry and kinematic properties of the final-state tracks and the reconstructed \u03c4 \u2212 candidate. It aims to reject backgrounds from combinations of tracks that do not share a common vertex and those from multibody decays with more than three final-state particles. The variables used in the classifier include the vertex fit quality, the displacement of the vertex from the PV, the pointing angle \u03b8, and the IP and fit \u03c7 2 of the tracks. An ensemble-selected (blended) [21], custom boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier is used [22,23], as described in the following. In the blending method the input variables are combined [24] into one BDT, two Fisher discriminants [25], four neural networks [26], one function-discriminant analysis [27] and one linear discriminant [28]. Each classifier is trained using simulated signal and background samples, where the composition of the background is a mixture of bb \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5X and cc \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5X processes according to their relative abundances as measured in data. As each category of simulated signal events has different kinematic properties, a separate set of classifiers is trained for each. One third of the available signal sample is used at this stage, along with one half of the background sample. The classifier responses, along with the original input variables, are then used as input to the custom BDT classifier, which is trained on the remaining half of the background sample and a third of the signal sample, with the five categories combined, to give the final classifier response. The responses of the classifier on the training and the test samples are found to be in good agreement, suggesting no overtraining of the classifier is present. As the responses of the individual classifiers are not fully correlated, blending the output of the classifiers improves the sensitivity of the analysis in our data sample by 6% with respect to that achievable by using the best single classifier. The M 3body classifier response is calibrated using the D \u2212 s \u2192 \u03c6 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) \u03c0 \u2212 control channel to correct for differences in response between data and simulation. Figure 1 shows good agreement between D \u2212 s \u2192 \u03c6 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) \u03c0 \u2212 data and simulation for one of the input variables to M 3body and for the classifier response. A systematic uncertainty of 2% is assigned to account for any remaining differences. The classifier response is found to be uncorrelated with mass for both the signal sample and the data sidebands.",

No significant excess of events over the expected background is observed. Using the CL s method [30,31] and eq. (7.1), the observed CL s value and the expected CL s distribution are calculated as functions of the assumed branching fraction, as shown in figure 5. The systematic uncertainties on the signal and background estimates, which have a very small effect on the final limits, are included following ref. [30,31]. The expected limit at 90% (95%) CL for the branching fraction is B (\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 5.0 (6.1) \u00d7 10 \u22128 , while the observed limit at 90% (95%) CL is",
