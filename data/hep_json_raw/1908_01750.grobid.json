The results are presented as a function of the charged particle multiplicity in the region |\u03b7| < 2. This measurement is sensitive to correlations induced by the underlying event structure over a very wide pseudorapidity region. The predictions of Monte Carlo event generators commonly used in collider experiments and ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics are compared to the data. All generators considered overestimate the fraction of energy going into hadrons.",

            "text": "The description of inclusive hadron production in high energy hadron-hadron collisions remains subject to significant theoretical uncertainties. At TeV energies the dominant source of secondary particle production is the fragmentation of quarks and gluons in semihard scattering [1], referred to as minijet production. However, various processes that cannot be directly calculated from first principles in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) also contribute to particle production, i.e. multiparton interactions (MPIs), and fragmentation of the remnants. Together with initial-and final-state radiation these additional particle production mechanisms are typically referred to as the underlying event and are modelled phenomenologically in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators with parameters tuned using data [2][3][4]. In addition, especially in the forward phase space, diffractive processes play an important role [5]. Furthermore, final-state parton rescattering effects, a possible hydrodynamical phase transition, or other collective phenomena can impact and modify particle production in hadron-hadron collisions at high energies [6]. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch",

For the first time measurements presented in this paper correlate the hadronic energy at very forward rapidities to the central region in proton-proton collisions, offering a new approach to the study of hadron production at the CERN LHC. Such measurements over a very large rapidity interval provide additional information on the underlying event compared to those based only on the central region, e.g. Refs. [10,11].",

Therefore, the present results can improve event generators used in simulations of extensive air showers induced by cosmic rays at ultra-high energies [14]. Specifically, current air shower simulations are known to significantly underestimate muon production (see Ref. [15] and references therein). The fraction of the energy going into the production of electrons or photons rather than long-lived hadrons has a crucial impact on the muon production rate in extensive air showers, see Ref. [16]. Since CASTOR consists of separate electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, the data presented here provide new information that may improve understanding of muon production in air showers.",

Within the solenoid volume in the central region are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gasionisation detectors embedded in the steel return yoke. The central detectors of CMS are complemented by calorimeters in the forward direction, which all rely on the detection of Cherenkov photons produced when charged particles pass through their active quartz components. The \"hadron forward\" (HF) calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity interval 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2 and use quartz fibres embedded in a steel absorber. The CASTOR calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter composed of layers of fused silica quartz plates and tungsten absorbers. It is located on only one side of CMS and covers the region \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2. CASTOR is segmented into 16 azimuthal towers, each with 14 longitudinal channels. The two front channels have a combined depth of 20 radiation lengths and form the electromagnetic section of each tower. The remaining 12 channels constitute the hadronic section. The full depth of a tower amounts to 10 hadronic interaction lengths. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and all relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [17]. A detailed description of the CASTOR calorimeter is given in Refs. [7,9,18]. For triggering purposes, the Beam Pickup Timing for the eXperiment (BPTX) devices were used [19].",

The efficiency to find more than two hits in the pixel detector drops quickly for |\u03b7| > 2; the search for tracks is therefore limited to |\u03b7| < 2. Tracks are retained if they originate from the expected interaction region and are linked to at least one interaction vertex. This pixel track reconstruction has an efficiency of about 76% and a probability of \u22485% of spurious tracks for charged particles with a transverse momentum p T larger than 200 MeV.",

Events with two reconstructed vertices are rejected if the vertices are separated by more than 0.5 cm along the z axis. This minimises the rejection of events with high particle multiplicity, where the reconstruction may create multiple spurious vertices. The probabilities for events to have additional collisions is evaluated in both data and simulation to be 1.5% (visible vertex) and 2.3% (invisible vertex). The correction of these background events is not straightforward, since the correction depends on the track multiplicity in the central region as well as on the model used in simulation. Therefore, the contribution from pileup events to the forward energy is considered part of the systematic uncertainty of the measurement.",

On average, 76% of the showers due to single electrons or photons are contained within the electromagnetic section of CASTOR, and single hadrons are 71% contained in the hadronic section. Moreover, for a given particle energy, the energies deposited by hadron-induced showers are smaller than electron-induced showers, which is known as noncompensation. These properties were precisely measured with a test beam and are implemented in the detector simulation. It was previously shown that the energy deposited in the corresponding sections of CASTOR can serve as good estimators for the particle-level energy of electrons/photons and hadrons [9]. The electromagnetic and hadronic energies of a given event are defined as the energies deposited in the corresponding detector sections of CASTOR, and the total energy as the sum of both. The events are classified according to the number of reconstructed charged tracks from the vertex. The average total, electromagnetic, and hadronic energy per event is calculated for each track multiplicity bin. The present data make it possible to study track multiplicities up to 150. The statistical uncertainties of the energy measurement are below 2%, much smaller than the systematic uncertainties. The most important sources of systematic uncertainties are described in the following and are summarised in Table 1: CASTOR energy scale The energy scale uncertainty of CASTOR is 17% [9]. The energy scale is determined using a calibration procedure based on SPS test-beam data, LHC beam halo muon events, a cross-calibration to the HF calorimeters, and LED test pulses, in combination with a precise detector alignment. The precision is currently limited by systematic effects related to the modelling and understanding of particle shower cascades in the calorimeter ranging from GeV to TeV energies. CASTOR intercalibration The relative intercalibration is performed using the measured response of each channel to single LHC beam halo muon events, which were recorded with a dedicated trigger during LHC interfill periods. This procedure is limited by the available muon statistics. For a measurement of the total energy, the uncertainty caused by intercalibration is averaged over the whole calorimeter and is 2-3%. For the determination of the electromagnetic and hadronic energy fractions, on the other hand, the effect of relative calibration becomes more significant. Dedicated studies based on full detector simulations of collision events demonstrate that the observed average shape of the longitudinal shower absorption in the calorimeter is consistent with only a slight overestimation of electromagnetic energies, and a corresponding underestimation of hadronic energies. We determine a maximum decrease of the electromagnetic energy by 8% and a corresponding increase of the hadronic energy by 15%, which are included as systematic uncertainties.",

These changes mainly affect the highmultiplicity region and lead to a systematic energy uncertainty of up to 10% for multiplicity >140. Collisions that do not create visible vertices in the detector introduce an additional uncertainty that is below 0.8%. HF energy scale The uncertainty in the reconstructed HF energies is 10% [33]. Varying the threshold for the event selection from 5.0 GeV per HF calorimeter tower to 4.5 and 5.5 GeV changes the average energy observed in CASTOR by less than 0.5%. Tracking The track reconstruction uncertainty has been previously determined from studies comparing data and simulation [32]. The uncertainties in the tracking and vertexing efficiencies affect the number of reconstructed tracks by 1.8 and 2-3%, respectively. These are combined linearly, yielding a 5% systematic uncertainty in the number of reconstructed tracks. The effect in the average energy is below 5%. Most of the uncertainties described here are uncorrelated and are therefore added in quadrature. Moreover, in the measured ratios between electromagnetic and hadronic energies the absolute energy scale uncertainty cancels, while the intercalibration uncertainty introduces a particular anticorrelated effect since a systematic decrease of the electromagnetic energy causes an increase of the hadronic energy and vice versa.",

The data are recorded during the first days of 13 TeV running with low beam intensities. The measurement is presented in terms of the total energy as well as its electromagnetic and hadronic components. The very forward region covered by the data contains the highest energy densities studied in proton-proton collisions at the LHC so far. This makes the present data relevant for improving the modelling of multiparticle production in event generators of ultra-high energy cosmic ray air showers.",

This demonstrates that the underlying event parameter tunes determined at central rapidity can be safely extrapolated to the very forward region within experimental uncertainties.

This is useful in the study of different particle production mechanisms, since the former is primarily due to the decay of neutral pions and the latter to the production of hadrons with longer lifetimes, mostly charged pions. All models give a good description of the electromagnetic energy dependence on the multiplicity, with the exception of sibyll 2.3c. Conversely, the predictions for the hadronic energy have a significantly larger spread compared to the electromagnetic case.",

The data exhibit a larger fraction of electromagnetic energy than the models, and disagree with the two most recent model tunes, i.e. sibyll 2.3c and pythia 8 CP5. Therefore, these models cannot explain the muon deficit in ultra-high energy air shower simulations since the data indicate that even more energy must be channelled into the electromagnetic part of the cascade and is thus lost for the generation of further hadrons [16]. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
