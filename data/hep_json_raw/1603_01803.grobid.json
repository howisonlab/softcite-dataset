The W \u00b1 boson production asymmetry was previously studied in pp collisions by the CDF and D0 collaborations [2][3][4][5][6]. At the LHC, the first measurements of the lepton charge asymmetries were performed by the CMS, ATLAS, and LHCb experiments using data collected in 2010 [7][8][9]. The CMS experiment has further improved the measurement precision in both the electron and muon decay channels using data from pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV corresponding to integrated luminosities of 0.84 and 4.7 fb \u22121 in the electron [10] and muon [11] decay channels, respectively. This measurement is based on a data sample of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by CMS during 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 fb \u22121 . At \u221a s = 8 TeV the average value of the Bjorken scaling variable for the interacting partons in W \u00b1 boson production is lower than at \u221a s = 7 TeV, which is expected to result in a lower W \u00b1 boson production charge asymmetry. This measurement provides important constraints on the proton PDFs, which is illustrated by the QCD analysis also presented in this paper.",

Events in this sample are collected with an isolated singlemuon trigger with a p T threshold of 24 GeV. To reduce the background, identification and isolation criteria are applied to the reconstructed muons. These requirements are similar to those used in the previous measurement [11]. Muon tracks must be reconstructed in both the silicon tracker and the muon detectors. The global muon fit is required to have a \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom less than 10. The pseudorapidity coverage for reconstructed muons is restricted to |\u03b7| < 2.4. Cosmic ray contamination is largely reduced by rejecting the muon candidates with a large (>0.2 cm) distance of closest approach to the primary vertex in the transverse plane. The isolation criterion is based on additional tracks reconstructed in a cone of ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 0.3 around the muon, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle (in radians) in the laboratory frame. The muon candidate is rejected if the scalar p T sum of these tracks is more than 10 % of the muon p T . The selected muon candidate with the largest p T , identified as a signal muon from the W boson decay, is required to have a p T > 25 GeV and also to be the particle that triggered the event. To reduce the background from Drell-Yan (DY) dimuon production, events containing a second identified muon with p T > 15 GeV are rejected.",

First, the efficiency values in each \u03b7p T bin are varied within their statistical errors for data and simulation independently. In each pseudo-experiment the varied set of efficiencies is used to correct the MC simulation templates and extract the cross sections using Eq. 3. The standard deviation of the resulting distribution is taken as a systematic uncertainty for each charge and |\u03b7| bin. The statistical uncertainties between the two charges and all \u03b7p T bins are uncorrelated. Second, the offline muon selection efficiency scale factors are varied by \u00b10.5 % coherently for both charges and all bins. The trigger selection efficiency scale factors are varied by \u00b10.2 %, assuming no correlations between the \u03b7 bins, but +100 % correlations between the charges and p T bins. The above systematic variations take into account uncertainties associated with the tag-and-probe technique and are assessed by varying signal and background dimuon mass shapes, levels of background, and dimuon mass range and binning used in the fits. Finally, an additional \u00b1100 % correlated variation is applied based on the bin-bybin difference between the true and measured efficiencies in the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 MC sample. This difference changes gradually from about 0.5 % in the first bin to about \u22122 % in the last bin. This contribution is the main source of negative correlations in the systematic uncertainties between the central and high rapidity bins. The total systematic uncertainty in the efficiency is obtained by adding up the four covariance matrices corresponding to the above variations. A possible mismeasurement of the charge of the muon could lead to a bias in the observed asymmetry between the W + and W \u2212 event rates. The muon charge misidentification rate has been studied in detail and was found to be negligible (10 \u22125 ) [7].",

This variation covers the maximum deviations indicated by the QCD MC simulation, as indicated in Fig. 2. The resulting systematic uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated between the |\u03b7| bins. Additionally, to take into account possible bias in this ratio due to different flavor composition in the signal and QCD control regions, the average difference of this ratio between the signal and QCD control regions is evaluated using the QCD MC simulation.

To estimate the systematic uncertainty in modeling the shape of the E / T distributions in QCD events, additional fits are performed using the E / T distributions without the hadronic recoil corrections and the p T -dependent scale factors; this results in a variation of about 2 % in the average E / T resolution.

All simulated events are weighted according to a given PDF set, varying both the template normalizations and shapes. For CT10 and MSTW2008 PDFs, asymmetric master equations are used [18,34]. For the NNPDF2.1 PDF set, the standard deviation of the extracted cross section distributions is taken as a systematic uncertainty. For the CT10, the 90 % confidence level (CL) uncertainty is rescaled to 68 % CL using a factor of 1.645. The half-width of the total envelope of all three PDF uncertainty bands is taken as the PDF uncertainty. The CT10 error set is used to estimate the correlations between the two charges and different |\u03b7| bins.",

The measurements were performed in 11 bins of absolute muon pseudorapidity |\u03b7| for muons with p T > 25 GeV. The results have been incorporated into a QCD analysis at next-to-nextto-leading-order together with the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA. A significant improvement in the accuracy of the valence quark distributions is observed in the range 10 \u22123 < x < 10 \u22121 , demonstrating the power of these muon charge asymmetry measurements to improve the main constraints on the valence distributions imposed by the HERA data, in the kinematics range probed. This strongly suggests the use of these measurements in future PDF determinations.
