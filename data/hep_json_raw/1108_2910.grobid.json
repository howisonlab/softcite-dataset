The detector was set up on the ground level at 24.3 m from the JOYO reactor core of 140 MW thermal power. The measured neutrino event rate from reactor on-off comparison was 1.11\u00b11.24(stat.)\u00b10.46(syst.) events/day. Although the statistical significance of the measurement was not enough, the background in such a compact detector at the ground level was studied in detail and MC simulation was found to describe the data well. A study for improvement of the detector for future such experiments is also shown.",

Now the reactor neutrino detection techniques have become mature after a number of reactor neutrino experiments so far performed [2][3]. Research and development of compact reactor neutrino detector utilizing the up-to-date technologies have become active recently [4] with an idea of using it as a monitor for Plutonium breeding in reactor cores [3][5] and as a very near detector to calibrate reactor neutrino operation and track the plutonium breeding. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) watches reactors in the world with surveillance cameras, reviewing operation record, etc. Because it is impossible to hide the 38 neutrinos, it could be a powerful tool to monitor the re-39 actor operation, in addition to the traditional monitoring 40 methods [6]. 41 The reactor neutrino monitoring has a potential to 42 non-destructively measure the plutonium amount in the 43 core. 44 Table 1 shows the energy releases and expected num-45 ber of emitted\u03bd e 's above 1.8 MeV per fission, and av-46 erage ratio of fission in the JOYO core for major isotopes in nuclear reactors.

The JOYO reactor is a sodium-cooled fast reactor built as an experimental reactor to promote commercialization of fast breeder reactor development [12].

Fraction of fissile Pu content (( 239 Pu + 241 Pu)/all) is about 16 w% at the inner core and about 21 w% at the outer core. JOYO reactor operates for 60 days then stops for a few weeks in its operational cycle. Therefore, we could collect data in both the reactor-on and reactor-off conditions. The data taken under reactor-off condition were used to measure the background. Thermal power of the rector was stable at 140 MW during its operation. Figure 1 shows time variations of fission rates of main isotopes ( 235 U, 238 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu) in the fuel.

This variable becomes large for the external background events, such as environmental gamma rays and fast neutrons, with the vertex position close to the surface of the detector while it is smaller for events occuring near the center. So CB cut corresponds to a kind of fiducial volume cut. However when the vertex position is too close to the surface and between the near PMT surfaces, the CB becomes smaller and the vertex position mimics a place around the center of the detector, because solid angles to the near PMT surfaces from the vertex position are narrow and number of photoelectrons for the near PMTs becomes less. Figure 13 shows the CB distributions of reactor neutrino and background events after energy and \u2206t cuts were applied. Distributions for the background events have a valley at CB \u223c 1.3. To maximize signal over noise ratio (S/N), cut conditions for CB were defined as:\u2022 0.8 \u2264 CB prompt \u2264 1.4 and 0.8 \u2264 CB delayed \u2264 1.4Even after the energy, \u2206t and charge balance cuts were applied, the remaining background events were still hundred times larger than the reactor neutrino events. The dominant component of the remaining background events was fast neutrons generated from muons in materials around the detector.",

            "text": "Statistics of the data was limited because the long 550 term data taking was impossible due to degradation 551 of Gd-LS.552 (2) Energy threshold level could not be sufficiently 553 lowered due to large amount of environmental \u03b3-554 rays from outside of the detector. Therefore, the 555 neutrino detection efficiency was obliged to be low. 556 (3) Performance of event vertex reconstruction was 557 not enough to distinguish external background 558 events entering the detector due to the same prob-559 lem caused by the detector structure as in the de-560 scription for CB in Section 6. 561 (4) Fast neutron background level was too high against 562 the neutrino signals, for which S/N ratio was 563 0.029 .564 We designed a new detector for the next experiment 565 solving these problems, and estimated the sensitivity to 566 reactor neutrino measurements based on the MC simu-567 lation. 568 We are considering a liquid scintillator with high 569 Pseudocumene concentration above 99 w% as possible 570 candidate to solve the Gd-LS degradation problem. The 571 high aromatic concentration is supposed to stabilize the 572 Gd-LS. Experimental studies of the long-term stabil-573 ity and characteristics of the proposed Pseudocumene 574 based Gd-LS are necessary. In addition, the detector de-575 sign needs to be improved to suppress fast neutron back-576 ground. The new detector will consist of two concen-577 tric sphere vessels. The inner vessel contains the Gd-LS 578 as target of reactor neutrinos. The outer vessel is filled 579 with paraffin oil with no scintillation light emission, and 580 works as shield against fast neutrons. In the MC simu-581 lation, we assumed the same target volume with Gd-LS, 582 surrounded by 20 cm layer of buffer oil. Environmen-583 tal \u03b3-rays are also reduced by the outer layer, by which 584 we estimate that the energy threshold can be lowered to 585 MeV with the same trigger rate as the measurement at 586 JOYO. The scintillation lights are viewed by 24 10-inch 587 PMTs isotropically arranged on the surface of the outer 588 vessel, providing 11 % photo-cathode coverage close to 589 JOYO detector. The PMT surfaces are away from the target vessel with the interval buffer region by which 591 performance of vertex position reconstruction can be 592 improved especially for those close to the surface of the 593 target vessel. The reconstructed vertex radii in the polar coordinate system are used for rejection of the external 595 background events. expect the S/N ratio is improved from 0.029 to 0.093, 598 with about 16 times larger neutrino selection efficiency 599 by the new detector design. If we put the same detector 600 at MONJU rector site [25], of which thermal power is 601 approximately five times higher than JOYO reactor, the 602 S/N ratio is further improved to 0.48 with 41 events/day 603 of neutrino observations. Significance of fast reactor 604 neutrino observation reaches 2 standard deviation after 605 12 days of reactor-on and off live-times at JOYO reactor 606 site or 1 day at MONJU reactor site. We carried out an experimental study of fast reac-609 tor neutrino detection and measured the background 610 spectrum at fast reactor JOYO using a compact detec-611 tor.
