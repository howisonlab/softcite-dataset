Since neutrinos have mass, sterile states may naturally arise from extensions to the Standard Model [15]. In this Letter, we test a phenomenological model in which the PMNS matrix is extended by the addition of a fourth neutrino mass eigenstate, \u03bd 4 , and a single sterile flavor state, \u03bd s . This '3+1' phenomenological model introduces three new mixing angles, \u03b8 14 , \u03b8 24 and \u03b8 34 , and two additional phases, \u03b4 14 and \u03b4 24 , when parameterized as in [6].

However, the sterile oscillation parameter space to which MINOS is sensitive stretches over the range 10 \u22123 eV 2 \u2206m 2 10 2 eV 2 , which could cause oscillations to impact both detectors [28]. Therefore, instead of using the ND data to predict the FD energy spectra, we analyze the ratio of energy spectra observed in the FD to those observed in the ND. This Far-over-Near ratio is analyzed for both CC \u03bd \u00b5 and NC events, as shown in Fig. 2. Aside from the overall difference in the number of events (caused by the distance between the detectors, their different masses and efficiencies, and the beam divergence) the main effect is the energy-dependent suppression of events at the FD caused by oscillations driven by \u2206m 2 32 . Our analysis searches for modulations on top of that oscillation pattern, caused by the sterile sector, by minimizing the \u03c7 2 as a function of the oscilla-tion parameters:",

We set sin 2 \u03b8 12 = 0.307 and \u2206m 2 21 = 7.54 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 based on a global fit to neutrino data [29], and sin 2 \u03b8 13 = 0.022 based on a weighted average of recent results from reactor experiments [30][31][32]. An analysis of solar and reactor neutrino data yields the constraint sin 2 \u03b8 14 = |U e4 | 2 < 0.041 at 90% C.L. [33], which is small enough to have a negligible effect on this analysis, so we set \u03b8 14 = 0. This analysis has negligible sensitivity to \u03b4 13 and \u03b4 14 , and minimal sensitivity to \u03b4 24 , hence all are set to zero. The impact of including the matter potential in the oscillation probability was investigated and found to have a negligible effect. The neutrino path-length between the meson decay point and the ND was taken into account in the computation of oscillation probabilities. Figure 2 shows a good agreement between the measured Far-over-Near ratios and those predicted using a three-flavor hypothesis. No significant distortions indicative of sterile neutrinos are observed. The predicted ratios include both statistical and systematic uncertainties that are incorporated into Eq. (6) via a covariance matrix,",

V norm contains a 1.6% uncertainty in the relative normalization of the CC sample between the ND and FD, and a corresponding 2.2% uncertainty for the NC sample. This accounts for uncertainties in reconstruction efficiencies. It was determined by a study in which a team of scanners looked at events in both detectors from both simulation and data to assess the level of reconstruction failures. No evidence for a mismodeling of the reconstruction failures was observed, and the values quoted for the uncertainties are the statistical precision to which the modeling could be tested.",

The dip in P (\u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u00b5) at 500 km/GeV is due to oscillations driven by \u2206m2 31 . As L/E increases, the various oscillation probabilities become similar and the lines overlap. The grey bands indicate the regions of reconstructed energy where CC \u03bd\u00b5 interactions (top panel) and NC interactions (bottom panel) are observed in the two detectors.",
