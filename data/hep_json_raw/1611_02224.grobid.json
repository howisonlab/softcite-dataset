            "text": "Neutral-current production of K + by atmospheric neutrinos is a background in searches for the proton decay p \u2192 K +\u03bd . Reactions such as \u03bdp \u2192 \u03bdK + \u039b are indistinguishable from proton decays when the decay products of the \u039b are below detection threshold. Events with K + are identified in MINERvA by reconstructing the timing signature of a K + decay at rest. A sample of 201 neutrinoinduced neutral-current K + events is used to measure differential cross sections with respect to the K + kinetic energy, and the non-K + hadronic visible energy. An excess of events at low hadronic visible energy is observed relative to the prediction of the neut event generator. Good agreement is observed with the cross section prediction of the genie generator. A search for photons from \u03c0 0 decay, which would veto a neutral-current K + event in a proton decay search, is performed, and a 2\u03c3 deficit of detached photons is observed relative to the genie prediction. Proton decay is predicted by Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. Models that incorporate supersymmetry predict the dominant channel to be p \u2192 K +\u03bd [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. Some models [8][9][10][11][12][13] predict proton lifetimes greater than 10 34 years, consistent with the current 90% confidence experimental bound of 5.6 \u00d7 10 33 years by Super-Kamiokande [14].",

With very low thresholds for charged hadrons, DUNE can potentially reach lower background rates by detecting the associated antikaon or hyperon present in all NC K + reactions. However, low-energy hadrons could be present in proton decay signal events due to interactions between the K + and the residual nucleus. The event selection must tolerate some nuclear activity to achieve high efficiency, and NC K + production with very low visible energy can mimic the signal process. The predicted background rate comes from a single event in a 1 Megatonyear simulation with a K + , no other tracks or \u03c0 0 s and less than 800 MeV of total visible energy [20].",

Strange particles are produced primarily from hadronization of deep inelastic scattering events, and also in the decays of \u2206 and N baryon resonances, for example \u2206(1750)\u2192 K\u03a3. Inelastic reactions for final-state hadronic invariant mass W < 1.7 GeV are simulated with a tuned model of discrete baryon resonance production [43]. Strange baryon resonances are not simulated. The transition to deep inelastic scattering is simulated using the Bodek-Yang model [44]. Hadronization at higher energies is simulated with the AGKY model [47] based on the gradual transition from KNO scaling [45] to the Lund string model of PYTHIA (version 6) [46] with increasing W . Parameters that control the rate of strange particle production in hadronization are tuned such that rates of \u039b and K 0 S production on deuterium and neon agree with BEBC [21][22][23][24] and Fermilab 15' [25,26] bubble chamber measurements. FSI are modeled using the INTRANUKE package [42,48]. FSI for K + in genie 2.8.4 include elastic and inelastic scattering but not charge exchange. Pion-induced processes that produce kaons, for example \u03c0 + n \u2192 K + \u039b, are not included, nor is any FSI for \u039b and \u03a3 hyperons.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we report the first high-statistics measurement of NC K + production by neutrinos. The measured cross section is in disagreement with the neut prediction at low E vis , and in good agreement with the genie prediction. Searches were performed for Michel electrons and for photon conversions, which would cause an event to be rejected in a proton decay search. We observe good agreement with genie in the rate of Michel electrons in low-E vis events, and a deficit of 30% in the number of photons compared to genie. Our data indicate that the neut cross section for NC K + production is too small by a factor of two in the kinematic region of most importance to searches for p \u2192 K +\u03bd .",
