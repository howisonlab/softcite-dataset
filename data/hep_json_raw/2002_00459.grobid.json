We point out that a slowly varying rate can bias or even simulate an annual modulation if data are analyzed in terms of residuals computed by subtracting approximately yearly averages starting from a fixed date, rather than a background continuous in time. In the most extreme case, the amplitude and phase of the annual modulation reported by DAMA could be alternatively interpreted as a decennial growth of the rate. This possibility appears mildly disfavoured by a detailed study of the available data, but cannot be safely excluded. In general, a decreasing or increasing rate could partially reduce or enhance a true annual modulation, respectively. The issue could be clarified by looking at the full time-dependence of the DAMA total rate, not explicitly published so far.",

Most experiments tried to increase the sensitivity to DM collisions by reducing their backgrounds and found no evidence for DM. The DAMA collaboration followed a different strategy, focused on large statistics: DM scatterings would contribute to the total event rate with an excess which is annually modulated due to the rotation of the Earth around the Sun. Indeed, the flux of DM particles hitting the Earth would peak around June, 2 nd , when the Earth's orbital velocity is more aligned to the Sun's motion with respect to the galactic frame.",

            "text": "The DAMA collaboration reported the observation of an annual modulation in singlehit scintillation events in NaI crystals, with the phase expected for a DM signal. The upgraded DAMA/LIBRA detector confirmed the earlier result of DAMA/NaI, collecting more data and reaching a significance of about 13 \u03c3 (loosely speaking) for the cumulative exposure [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The ANAIS [7][8][9] and COSINE [10][11][12] experiments employ NaI crystals like DAMA, and are also looking for an annual modulation in the counting rate. So far they have not reported any modulation, but their sensitivity is not yet sufficient to probe the DAMA signal [12,13]. Furthermore, a DM signal compatible with the DAMA result has not been confirmed by other experiments which use different detectors and techniques (see e.g. the review of DM in [14]). These experiments reached high sensitivity to both DM nuclear and electron recoils and, therefore, proposing theoretically viable DM interpretations of the DAMA detection progressively becomes very challenging [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29].",

            "text": "The DAMA collaboration published the cumulative total rate of the single-hit scintillation events as a function of the electron equivalent recoil energy in [1,4,6]. The full time dependence was never explicitly presented. On the other hand, the collaboration presented the modulated residual as a function of time, computed by subtracting -roughly every year and roughly starting from the same date -the weighted average of the total rate in a given cycle of data-taking. This is a dangerous approach, since a time-scale similar to the DM periodicity is introduced in the analysis. Indeed, the analysis procedure adopted by DAMA transforms a rate that varies with time into a sawtooth with period given by the duration of the analysis cycles. If cycles start around the beginning of September and last roughly one year, a growing background mimics an annual modulation peaked in June. As a result, a slow time-dependence of the total rate, even if not oscillating, becomes a possible source of bias. For example, the DAMA modulated amplitude could be generated by a growth of the rate of several percent on a decennial time-scale. This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the general idea, and we show how the amplitude and phase of a modulated signal are related to the time variation of the total rate. We apply this to a practical example. In section 3 we briefly present the DAMA analysis. A toy Monte Carlo simulation is performed in 3.1, showing that a linearly growing rate produces a sawtooth signal that can appear as a cosine, up to statistical errors. In section 4 we consider the DAMA data. We study the detailed time-dependence of the DAMA residuals in section 4.1, finding that both a cosine and a sawtooth provide acceptable fits to the data, with the cosine interpretation being somewhat favoured. This extreme possibility is consistent with corollary DAMA studies [6], which include a Fourier analysis. In section 4.2 we infer the energy dependence of the secular variation. We discuss some possible time-dependent backgrounds in section 4.3. Conclusions are given in section 5.",

The data are shown in the left panel of figure 1 as a function of publication time t. The average number of references per paper is slowly growing with time because of the overall expansion of the field. The number of citations is slowly decreasing with time because more recent papers have not yet fully accumulated citations. These slow variations produce an apparent annual modulation with fractional amplitude 8) when data are analyzed following the procedure described above (i.e. by subtracting the yearly averages from N (t)). The artificial modulation peaks approximately 3 months later than the start of the analysis period (January, 1 st ) for citations, since N cit (t) grows with time, and approximately 9 month later for references, since N ref (t) decreases with time. A different analysis procedure allows to search for a modulation over a slowly varying background without introducing an artificial modulation that biases the signal. The residuals are now computed by subtracting a smooth function that follows the average slow evolution of the background, rather than the discontinuous yearly averages. Such functions can be obtained, for example, as a 1 st or 2 nd order interpolation of the yearly averages. In this language the 'dangerous' procedure corresponds to subtracting a 0 th order discontinuous interpolation. The two possibilities are plotted in lighter/darker color in figure 1. The right panel of figure 1 shows the residuals computed following the two procedures. As expected, the two modulation residuals differ by a few %, and their phase is shifted.",

This procedure results in something that looks like a cosine annual modulation. Unlike a true sinusoidal modulation, discontinuities are present between the various cycles. However, the binning procedure can partially wash out these discontinuities: if a time bin falls in two different cycles, as sometimes happens for the DAMA binning, the sawtooth will approximately average to zero over the bin, and the residual number of events in the bin will be small. Averaging the rate over 25 crystals with different efficiencies and duty cycles could also have an impact in this respect.",

More precisely, the sawtooth fit has \u03c7 2 saw /d.o.f. = 137.1/137, and the cosine fit has \u03c7 2 cos /d.o.f. = 118.8/138. 4 The best-fit value for the cosine amplitude is in perfect agreement with the result reported by the DAMA collaboration, A = (0.0102 \u00b1 0.0008) cpd/kg/keVee [6]. We get similar results when leaving the phase and period of the cosine free to vary. For the sawtooth, the best-fit values of the B coefficients are B NaI = (0.060 \u00b1 0.009) cpd/kg/keVee/yr , for DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA, respectively, which correspond to a yearly growth of the total rate of a few percent.

The two theoretical hypotheses result in similar \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. in all cases, except for the higher energy bin of DAMA/LIBRA Phase 2 where a cosine is favoured. We also provide combined results with a single B for the three phases in the (2-6) keVee energy interval where this is possible. The results of all our fits are summarized in table 1.",

Indeed, when fitting data with many degrees of freedom, a likelihood-ratio test is a more powerful statistical indicator than the \u03c7 2 test. The two tests answer different questions: the \u03c7 2 compares the considered model to a generic model, such that all statistical fluctuations contribute. On the other hand, the \u2206\u03c7 2 compares two specific models such that only those statistical fluctuations that discriminate among the two models contribute. We perform a \u2206\u03c7 2 fit of the data to a generic superposition of a sawtooth plus a cosine. We fix the period of the cosine to one year, and its peak to June 2nd, as predicted for a DM-induced annual modulation signal, so that the only free parameter is the amplitude A. The sawtooth also has one free parameter, the slope B, since its phase and duration are fixed by the DAMA analysis choices. Figure 6 shows the results of the fit as 68%, 95% and 99.7% allowed contours of A and B. On the left we consider the (2-6) keVee energy interval for the three phases of DAMA, while on the right we fit data in the lower energy window ((2 -4) keVee for both DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA Phase 1, and (1-3) keVee for DAMA/LIBRA Phase 2). In the (2 -6) keVee interval the earlier DAMA/NaI data resemble more a sawtooth, while the more precise later Phase 2 data favour a cosine-dominated fit. Data in the lower energy interval are fitted equally well by both possibilities, a cosine or a secular variation.",

In the left panel of figure 7 we show the regions of A and t peak preferred at 68%, 95% and 99.7% C.L. by the combined DAMA data-set in the (2-6) keVee energy interval, both allowing for a free sawtooth component or setting it to zero. In the right panel we show the same but only for DAMA/LIBRA Phase 2 in the (1-3) keVee energy interval. The best-fit regions assuming zero sawtooth (in gray) reproduce the results reported by DAMA (see e.g. figure 15 of [6]). Allowing for a sawtooth component substantially affects the best fit regions. In particular, the phase of the cosine becomes more uncertain and can more significantly differ from the value characteristic of a DM signal, especially when fitting data at lower energy. The DAMA collaboration analyzed the data by adopting two additional methods that are potentially relevant to indirectly clarify the time-dependence of the background. In [4][5][6] a frequency analysis of the residuals has been presented. In section 5 of [6] this result is complemented at frequencies below about 1/yr with a spectral analysis of the yearly averaged total rate. We have summarized relevant details of the procedure at the end of our section 3.1. We report in the right panel of figure 4 the power spectrum of the combined DAMA/LIBRA Phase 1 and Phase 2 data, taken from [6], as black and red curves for the high and low frequencies, respectively. This power spectrum can be compared to what expected from a sawtooth or cosine annual modulation (shown in the left panel of  Figure 8. Energy dependence of the modulated signal observed by DAMA. The black points are the amplitudes of the cosine signal reported by DAMA in 0.5 keVee energy bins [6]; for comparison we also show the DM cosine amplitudes in the wider energy intervals discussed above (red points), and our best-fit values for a linearly growing background (blue points).

Second, the high-energy tails of the black points in figure 9 (right) are approximately constant; one could therefore wonder whether the full difference could be explained by the energy dependence of the secular term B plus a constant shift \u2206R.

These are related to the photo-multipliers (PMT) and electronics, and they are more difficult to isolate with respect to the previous ones. For example, helium gas permeating through PMT glass increases the after-pulse rate [41] creating fake low energy signals simulating the real scintillation. These are not easily rejectable through simple pulse shape discriminations, as suggested in [42] (although with completely different implications that we do not consider in this work). Another example is the possible increase of the electronic noise leaking in the acceptance region after pulse shape discrimination due to a generic loss of performance of the hardware.",

The available data are consistent with the modulation being interpreted as an artefact due to a yearly growth of the total rate of a few percent. A DM cosine provides a somehow better fit to parts of the data-set -specifically the higher energy bins of DAMA/LIBRA Phase 2 -therefore preferring a DM-like signal as a dominant explanation of the observed modulation. A time-dependent background rate would have an impact on the signal also in this case, since it would affect the extraction of the cosine amplitude and phase from the data, as shown in figure 7. This effect can be important since the position of the sinusoid peak plays an important role in the interpretation of the modulation as a DM signal. A spectral analysis of the residuals and of the annual averaged rate is found to be consistent with a slow variation of the rate, as well as with a true annual modulation.",

This procedure can be dangerous, because a possible secular variation of the total rate would be transformed into a sawtooth with period coinciding with the duration of the DAMA analysis cycles. As a result, a slowly time-dependent rate, even if not oscillating, becomes a possible source of apparent modulation. Within the statistical accuracy, the modulation possibly produced by the procedure can resemble a cosine with period of one year. Since the data-analysis cycles usually start around September, the apparent cosine would peak at the beginning of June if the background slowly grows with time.",
