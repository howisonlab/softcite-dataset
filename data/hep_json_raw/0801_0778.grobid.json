Fit of the experimental data based on the E429 solution of the SAID partial wave analysis suggests a narrow (\u0393 \u2264 25 MeV) resonance. Possible candidates are P11, P13, or D13 resonances. The result is considered in conjunction with the recent evidence for a bump-like structure at W \u223c 1.67 \u2212 1.68 GeV in the quasi-free \u03b7 photoproduction on the neutron.",

The structure has been observed as a relatively narrow bump in the quasifree cross section and in the \u03b7n invariant mass spectrum  Fig. 1.

A narrow resonance which would manifest itself as a peak in the free neutron cross section, would appear in the quasi-free cross section as a bump of \u223c 50 MeV(FWHM) width [1]  (Fig. 1). The M (\u03b7, n) spectrum is much less affected by Fermi motion but includes larger uncertainties due to detector response. The observed width, of \u223c 50 MeV(FWHM), is close to the instrumental resolution [1]. Several attempts to explain the observed bump have been recently done. The authors of [6,7,8] suggested a narrow P 11 (1675) resonance. Alternatively, the authors of [9,10] explained the observed bump in terms of photoexcitation and interference of the S 11 (1650) and P 11 (1710) [9] or S 11 (1535) and S 11 (1650) [10] resonances.",

Those events whose kinematics is relatively stronger distorted by Fermi motion or those which originate from the re-scattering and FSI, are in part eliminated in the data analysis. This procedure necessarily depends on experimental setup and on cuts used in data analysis. Therefore the quasi-free cross section measured in experiment may deviate from the cross section calculated for the free neutron and then smeared by Fermi motion. M (\u03b7, n) is almost unaffected by Fermi motion. Its spectrum exhibits a narrow peak at M (\u03b7, n) = 1.678 GeV. This peak seems not to be reproduced by calculations [9,10].",

The data sets were based on two different samples of events: i) Events with both photons from \u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3 decays detected in the BGO Ball; ii) Events in which one of the photons, being emitted at the angles \u03b8 lab \u2264 25 \u2022 , was detected in the forward shower wall, and the other was detected in the BGO ball. The second type of events was found to be particularly efficient at forward angles and energies above 0.9 GeV. The results have shown a marked peaking at forward (\u223c 40 \u2212 50 \u2022 ) angles and E \u03b3 \u223c 1.05 GeV. An extension to higher energies up to 1.5 GeV has been reported in Ref. [13]. Two samples of events were merged and analyzed together. This made it possible to significantly reduce error bars at forward angles and to retrieve a maximum in the angular dependence at 50 \u2022 and E \u03b3 \u223c 1.05 GeV. A new measurement has been done by the CB/TAPS Collaboration using a different technique of the photon-beam polarization, the coherent bremsstrahlung from diamond radiator [14].

[15] found \"... no evidence for a narrow P 11 (1670) state...\" in the beam asymmetry data. In Fig. 2 our data and the data from Ref. [15] are plotted together. Both data sets are consistent. The major difference is that we observe a dip structure at 103 \u2022 . The authors of Ref. [15] show the data at 116 \u2022 where they do not observe any dip structure. However no reliable data can be produced in this (116 \u2022 ) angular bin. At the photon energy 1.05 GeV recoil protons are emitted into a gap between the forward and the central part of the GRAAL detector where they cannot be properly detected. A question to be addressed to the authors of Ref. [15]: whether do they observe a dip structure near 100 \u2022 ? 2 In summary, we report an evidence for a narrow resonance structure in the \u03a3 beam asymmetry data for the \u03b7 photoproduction on the free proton. This structure may manifest a narrow resonance with the mass M \u223c 1.688 GeV and the width \u0393 \u2264 25 MeV. As candidates, narrow S 11 , P 11 , P 13 , and D 13 resonances are tried. Among them, either the P 11 , or P 13 , or D 13 resonance improves the description of the data. Most probably, the same resonance is observed 2 Some consideration of this issue is given in the slide 19 of Ref. [16].",
