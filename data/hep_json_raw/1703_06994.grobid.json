Within the standard model (SM), this large mass arises from a large Yukawa coupling (\u2248 0.9) to the Higgs field. Consequently, loops involving the top quark contribute significantly to electroweak quantum corrections, and therefore a precise measurement of the top quark mass, m t , provides a means to test the consistency of the SM. Furthermore, the precise values of both the mass of the Higgs boson and the Yukawa coupling of the top quark may play a critical role in the history and stability of the universe (see e.g., Ref. [2]).",

Run II (2001-2011) at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV followed, providing a factor of \u2248 150 more top-antitop quark pairs than Run I, and far more precise measurements of m t . Using tt events produced in the D0 detector [5][6][7][8], we have measured m t in different decay channels [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] using the full integrated luminosity of Run I ( L dt = 0.1 fb \u22121 ) and Run II ( L dt = 9.7 fb \u22121 ). This article reports the combination of these direct top quark mass measurements. Direct measurements of the top quark mass have also been performed by the CDF experiment (see e.g. Ref. [16]) at the Tevatron, and by the ATLAS (see e.g. Ref. [17]) and CMS (see e.g. Ref. [18]) experiments at the CERN LHC. In 2012, the Tevatron experiments combined their measurements in Ref. [19] with the result m t = 173.18\u00b10.94 GeV. In 2014, a preliminary combination of ATLAS, CDF, CMS, and D0 measurements [20] yielded m t = 173.34 \u00b1 0.76 GeV. Both combinations are by now outdated as they do not include the latest and more precise measurements, in particular, the final D0 Run II measurements discussed in this article.",

However, because of the presence of long range effects in QCD, the relationship beween the MC mass and other mass definitions, such as the pole mass or the mass in the modified minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, is not well established and has been subject to debate for many years (see e.g., Ref.

Approximately 90% of the selected events are common to both analyses, and the measurements are therefore statistically correlated. We use an ensemble testing method to estimate these correlations. In the first step, we generate 1000 ensembles of simulated background and signal events with mass m t =172.5 GeV that pass the criteria of either the NW or the ME selection (see Refs. [12] and [13] for the detailed descriptions of the selections). Each ensemble is generated with the same number of events as observed in data, using the expected signal and background fractions, separately for the ee, \u00b5\u00b5, and e\u00b5 channels. The ME and NW ensembles are then obtained using the individual and slightly more restrictive selection criteria from each analysis, and m t is extracted following each of the analysis methods. From the two-dimensional distribution of the measured masses shown in Fig 1, we obtain a statistical correlation of \u03c1 = 0.64 \u00b1 0.02 between the two sets of measurements.",

Adding the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields a total uncertainty of 0.75 GeV, corresponding to a relative precision of 0.43% on the top quark mass. The breakdown of the uncertainties is shown in Table VII. The dominant sources of uncertainty are the statistical uncertainty, the JES calibration, which has statistical origin, and the modeling of the signal. The total statistical and systematic uncertainties are reduced relative to the published D0 and CDF combination [19] due primarily to the latest and most accurate D0 \u2113+jets analysis [14,15]. As a test of stability, we vary the correlation of the dominant source of uncertainties, 'signal modeling', from 100% to 0%, first between Run I and Run II measurements, and in a second check between all measurements. The combined value of m t does not change by more than 50 MeV, while the uncertainty changes by no more than 20 MeV. This is due to the fact that the Run II \u2113 + jets measurement dominates the combination with a weight of 96%. Thus, the combination is not sensitive to the detailed description of the correlation of systematic uncertainties. Due to a much smaller total uncertainty resulting in the large weight for the \u2113+jets measurement, the improvement in the combined uncertainty relative to the individual \u2113+jets uncertainty is smaller than 10 MeV. The input measurements and the resulting D0 average mass of the top quark are summarized in Fig. 2, along with the top quark pole mass extracted by D0 from the measurement of the tt cross section [23].",

The inner red uncertainty bars represent the statistical uncertainties, while the blue bars represent the total uncertainties. For comparison, we also show the preliminary 2014 world average of mt [20] which includes D0 Run II \u2113\u2113 \u2032 and \u2113 + jets measurements that are now superseded. For the top quark pole mass extracted from the D0 cross section measurement, a 1.1 GeV theory uncertainty is included in the systematic uncertainty, and the statistical uncertainty is determined such as its relative contribution to the experimental uncertainty is the same as for the cross-section measurement.",
