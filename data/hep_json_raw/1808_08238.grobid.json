The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 79.8 fb-1 were collected in proton-proton collisions during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.9 (4.3) standard deviations. A combination with the results from other searches in Run 1 and in Run 2 for the Higgs boson in the bb decay mode is performed, which yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.4 (5.5) standard deviations, thus providing direct observation of the Higgs boson decay into b-quarks. The ratio of the measured event yield for a Higgs boson decaying into bb to the Standard Model expectation is 1.01 \u00b1 0.12(stat.)+0.j6(syst.). Additionally, a combination of Run 2 results searching for the Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.3 (4.8) standard deviations.",

            "text": "The Higgs boson [1][2][3][4] was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [5,6] with a mass of approximately 125 GeV from the analysis of proton-proton (pp) collisions pro duced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7]. Since then, the analysis of data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7TeV, 8TeV and 13 TeV in Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC has led to the observation of many of the production modes and decay channels predicted by the Standard Model (SM). The bosonic decay channels are well established and have entered an era of precision measure ments [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The decay into t-lepton pairs was first observed in the combination of the ATLAS and CMS analyses [19,20]. The main Higgs boson production modes, gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) and vector-boson fusion (VBF), were already measured following the analysis of the Run 1 data, and recently the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks was directly observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [21,22] through the observation of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a top-quark pair (tt H).",

However, large backgrounds from multi-jet production make a search in the dominant gluon gluon fusion production mode very challenging at hadron colliders. The most sensitive production modes for detecting H bb de cays are the associated production of a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson [24] (VH), where the leptonic decay of the vector bo son enables efficient triggering and a significant reduction of the multi-jet background. As well as probing the dominant decay of the Higgs boson, this measurement allows the overall Higgs bo son decay width [25,26] to be constrained and provides the best sensitivity to the ZH and WH production modes, which are (for instance) important elements in the interpretation of Higgs boson measurements in effective field theories [27].",

In addition, an updated version of the ATLAS re construction code and improved object calibrations are used, the impact of the luminosity and modelling systematic uncertainties are reduced from updated measurements and estimates, and larger samples of simulated events are used to model the background processes. Events are selected in 0-, 1and 2-lepton channels, based on the number of charged leptons, \u00a3 (electrons or muons), to explore the ZH vvbb, WH \u00a3vbb and ZH \u00a3\u00a3bb signa tures, respectively. The dominant background processes after the event selection are V + jets, tt, single-top and diboson process.",

Their output distributions are combined using a binned maximum-likelihood fit, referred to as the global likelihood fit, which allows the signal yield and the background normalisations to be extracted. The signal extraction method is cross-checked with the dijet-mass analysis, where the signal yield is extracted using the mass of the dijet system as the main fit observable, and validated using the diboson analysis, where the nominal multivariate analysis is modified to extract the VZ, Z bb diboson process. The result of the multivariate analy sis is then combined with that of the previously published analysis of Run 1 data [30], with other searches for bb decays of the Higgs boson and with other searches in the VH production mode. The latter two combinations lead to the observation of both the bbt de cay of the Higgs boson and VH production. An observation of the bb decay of the Higgs boson by the CMS Collaboration [31] was submitted for publication at the same time as this Letter.",

An in ner tracking detector, located within a 2 T axial magnetic field generated by a thin superconducting solenoid, is used to measure the trajectories and momenta of charged particles. The inner layers consist of high-granularity silicon pixel detectors covering a pseu dorapidity range lnl < 2.5, and include an innermost layer [45,46] that was added to the detector between Run 1 and Run 2. Sil icon microstrip detectors covering lnl < 2.5 are located beyond the pixel detectors. Outside the microstrip detectors and covering lnl < 2.0, there are straw-tube tracking detectors, which also pro vide measurements of transition radiation that are used in electron identification. A calorimeter system surrounds the inner tracking detector, covering the pseudorapidity range lnl < 4.9. Within the region lnl < 3.2, electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by bar rel (lnl < 1.475) and endcap (1.375 < lnl < 3.2) high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering lnl < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is pro vided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter within lnl < 1.7, and copper/LAr endcap calorimeters extend the coverage to lnl = 3.2. The solid angle coverage for lnl between 3.2 and 4.9 is completed with copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. The 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP towards the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, $) are used in the transverse plane, $ being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle 0 as n = -lntan(0/2). The distance in (n, $) coordinates, AR = \u25a0/(A$)2 + (An)2, is also used to define cone sizes. Transverse momentum and energy are defined as pT = p sin 0 and ET = E sin 0, respectively.",

Jets are required to have pT > 20 GeV in the central region ( ln l < 2.5), and pT > 30 GeV outside (2.5 < n < 4.5) of the tracker acceptance. In the central region, they are tagged as containing b-hadrons using a multivariate dis criminant [59] (MV2), with the selection tuned to produce an av erage efficiency of 70% for b-jets in simulated tt events, which corresponds to light-flavour (u-, d-, s-quark and gluon) and c-jet misidentification efficiencies of 0.3% and 12.5% respectively. Simulated jets are labelled as b-, c-or light-flavour jets accord ing to which hadrons with pT > 5 GeV are found within a cone of size AR = 0.3 around their axis. Simulated V + jets events are categorised depending on the labels of the jets that form the Higgs boson candidate: V + ll when they are both light-flavour jets, V + cl when there is one c-jet and one light-flavour jet, and V + HF (heavy flavour) in all other cases, mainly two b-jets. Owing to the large rejection of light-flavour jets achieved by the MV2 discrimi nant, simulated V + ll, V + cl and WW events are not subjected to the b-tagging requirement due to the resulting low number of simulated events, but instead they are weighted by the probability that their jets pass the b-tagging selection [32].",

As the signal-to-background ratio increases for large Higgs boson transverse momenta [62,63], the analysis focuses on a high-pV region defined as p-V > 150 GeV. In the 2-lepton channel, the sensitivity is increased by the addition of a medium-p-V region with 75 GeV < pV < 150 GeV. Two versions of the analysis are carried out, one using a mul tivariate approach and the other using the dijet mass as the final discriminant.

(f) The NNLO(QCD)+NLO(EW) cross-section calculation for the pp ZH process already includes the gg ZH contribution. The qq ZH process is normalised using the cross-section for the pp ZH process, after subtracting the gg ZH contribution. An additional scale factor is applied to the qq VH processes as a function of the transverse momentum of the vector boson, to account for electroweak (EW) corrections at NLO. This makes use of the VH differential cross-section computed with Hawk [74,75]. ",

A summary of all the generators used for the simulation of the signal and background processes is shown in Table 4. Samples pro duced with alternative generators are used to estimate systematic uncertainties in the event modelling, as described in Section 5. The background processes involving W or Z boson decays into leptons (including those in which the W boson arises from a top quark decay) are collectively referred to in the following as electroweak (EW) backgrounds and were simulated as described above. In contrast, the multi-jet background is estimated in all three channels using data-driven methods. In both the 0-and 2-lepton channels, the multi-jet contribution is estimated from template fits to data, using the simulated samples to model the EW back grounds and a functional form to model the multi-jet background. The template fit is performed using a variable that provides sig nificant discrimination between the multi-jet and EW processes, with any selection on that variable removed. In the 0-lepton chan nel, min[A0(Em'ss> jets)] is used, and in the 2-lepton channel, the dilepton mass distribution is used for the case where the charges of the lepton candidates have the same sign, assuming the multi jet contribution is symmetric for opposite-and same-sign lepton charges. In both cases, it is found that the multi-jet contribution is sufficiently small that it can be neglected in the global likelihood fit without having any impact on the extracted signal.",

In each category, a template fit to the transverse mass distribution of the W boson candidate is performed, which offers the clearest dis crimination between the multi-jet and EW processes, to extract the multi-jet yield. The template used for the multi-jet contribu tion is obtained from data in a control region after subtraction of the residual EW contribution, based on MC predictions, while the template for the EW contribution in the signal region is ob tained directly from MC predictions. The control region is enriched in multi-jet events that are kinematically close to the correspond ing signal region but not overlapping with it, and is defined by applying the nominal selection but inverting the stricter lepton isolation requirements. To increase the statistical precision of the data-driven estimate, the number of required b-tagged jets is re duced from two to one in the multi-jet enriched control region. The template fit applied in the signal region determines the nor malisation of the multi-jet contribution, while the shape of the BDT discriminant (or of other relevant observables) is obtained us ing a control region analogously to the mT W template. Both the normalisation and shape derived for the BDT discriminant are then used in the global likelihood fit. The multi-jet contribution in the 2-jet category is found to be 1.9% (2.8%) of the total background contribution in the electron (muon) sub-channel, while in the 3-jet category it is found to be 0.2% (0.4%).

All three correc tion factors have uncertainties estimated from multiple measure ments, which are decomposed into uncorrelated components that are then treated independently, resulting in three uncertainties for b-jets and c-jets, and five for light-flavour jets. The approximate size of the uncertainty in the tagging efficiency is 2% for b-jets, 10% for c-jets and 40% for light-flavour jets. Additional uncertain ties are considered in the extrapolation of the b-jet efficiency cal ibration to jets with pT > 300 GeV and in the misidentification of hadronically decaying t-leptons as b-jets. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are based on their respective measurements [60,110].

The additional systematic uncertainties in the ac ceptance differences and in the shapes are derived either from particle-level comparisons between nominal and alternative simu lated samples, or from comparisons with data in control regions. The particle-level comparisons are cross-checked with detector level simulations whenever these are available, and good agree ment is found.

Constraining the cross sections of the production modes to be as predicted by the SM, the combination measures the ratio of the branching fraction of the Higgs boson into b-quarks to the SM prediction.
