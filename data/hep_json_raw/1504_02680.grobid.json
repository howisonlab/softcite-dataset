The corresponding effective electromagnetic form factor of the proton is deduced under the assumption that the electric and magnetic form factors are equal (|GE| = |GM |). In addition, the ratio of electric to magnetic form factors, |GE/GM |, and |GM | are extracted by fitting the polar angle distribution of the proton for the data samples with larger statistics, namely at \u221a s = 2232.4 and 2400.0 MeV and a combined sample at \u221a s = 3050.0, 3060.0 and 3080.0 MeV, respectively. The measured cross sections are in agreement with recent results from BaBar, improving the overall uncertainty by about 30%. The |GE /GM | ratios are close to unity and consistent with BaBar results in the same q 2 region, which indicates the data are consistent with the assumption that |GE| = |GM | within uncertainties.",

The lowest order Feynman diagram of lepton-proton scattering is shown in Fig. 1(a). The momentum transfer squared, q 2 , is negative and the FFs are real functions of q 2 . The lowest order e + e \u2212 annihilation process is shown in Fig. 1(b). Here, q 2 is positive and the FFs are complex functions of q 2 . The basic kinematic variables are also shown in Fig. 1, where k, k \u2032 are the initial and final electron momenta and p, p \u2032 are the initial and final proton momenta. Since the electromagnetic vertex of the lepton is well known, one can reliably extract the proton electromagnetic vertex \u0393 \u00b5 by measuring the cross section and the polarization. Assuming one-photon exchange, i.e. in Born approximation, and under the basic requirements of Lorentz invariance, the hadronic vertex can be parameterized in terms of two FFs, F 1 and F 2 [1],",

The latter has been applied to obtain the \u00b5 p G E /G M ratio. Results from the GEp-II experiment at JLab's Hall A [7,8] for \u00b5 p G E /G M show that this ratio decreases rather quickly with increasing Q 2 , where Q 2 = \u2212q 2 \u2265 0, while results achieved by the Rosenbluth method show an almost constant ratio [9]. The discrepancy between the Rosenbluth and the polarization transfer method may be resolved by including higher order corrections like two-photon exchange. A small correction to the Rosenbluth separation could imply a large correction for the extraction of G E , since G E is the slope of the Rosenbluth plot. However, the correction of including two-photon exchange is small and cannot significantly influence the results of the polarization transfer experiment.",

            "text": "In the TL region, measurements have been performed in the direct production channel e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp [10][11][12][13][14], in the radiative return channel e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp(\u03b3 ISR ) [15,16] where \u03b3 ISR refers to a photon emitted by initial state radiation (ISR), and inpp \u2192 e + e \u2212 [17][18][19] experiments. In cases where the data sample is too small to extract angular distributions and disentangle |G E | and |G M |, the effective proton FF |G| can be calculated from the total cross section, assuming |G E | = |G M |. This assumption is valid at the pp mass threshold, if analyticity of the FFs holds, implying that at threshold the angular distribution should be isotropic. In the PS170 experiment at LEAR [17], the effective proton FF was obtained, as well as the |G E /G M | ratio, from pp threshold up to \u221a s = 2.05 GeV. In the BaBar experiment at PEP-II [15,16], the cross section was measured using the ISR method from the pp production threshold up to \u221a s = 6.5 GeV. The |G E /G M | ratio was measured from threshold up to \u221a s = 3.0 GeV and the result shows an inconsistency with respect to the PS170 results.  The presence of vector resonances, like \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 in the unphysical region, below the pp threshold, can influence the functional form of the FFs in the physical region. Hence the FFs, in particular the ratio |G E /G M |, in the TL region cannot be simply extrapolated from the SL ones. Until now it has been assumed that all FFs respect analyticity, which should allow to calculate their behavior in the unphysical region thanks to dispersion relations [20] using the available data in both the TL and SL regions. In the SL region, the ratio \u00b5 p G E /G M has been measured at 16 Q 2 values in (0.5, 8.5) GeV 2 with the best precision to 1.7% [7,8], while the present precision of |G E /G M | in the TL region exceeds 10% by far. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the measurement of |G E /G M | ratio in the TL region.",

SUMMARY Using data at 12 c.m. energies between 2232.4 MeV and 3671.0 MeV collected with the BESIII detector, we measure the Born cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp and extract the corresponding effective FF |G| under the assumption |G E | = |G M |. The results are in good agreement with previous experiments. The precision of the Born cross section with \u221a s \u2264 3.08 GeV is between 6.0% and 18.9% which is much improved comparing with the best precision of previous results (between 9.4% and 26.9%) from BaBar experiment [15]; and the precision is comparable with those of previous results at \u221a s > 3.08 GeV. The |G E /G M | ratios and |G M | are extracted at the c.m. energies \u221a s = 2232.4 and 2400.0 MeV and a combined data sample with c.m. energy of 3050.0, 3060.0 and 3080.0 MeV, with comparable uncertainties to previous",
