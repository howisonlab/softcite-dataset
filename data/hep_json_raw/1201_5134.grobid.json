The measurements of W boson properties at LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, using data collected before Summer 2011, are presented. These measurements are essential at the preparation stage of the W boson mass measurements at LHC. Challenges for W mass measurement at the LHC in comparison with the Tevatron are outlined. Prospects for W mass precision with upcoming measurements and its implications are discussed.",

To reduce the background of jets faking electrons, electron candidates are required to have a large fraction of their energy deposited in the EM section of the calorimeter and pass energy isolation and shower shape requirements. Electron candidates are classified as tight if a track is matched spatially to EM cluster and if the track transverse momentum is close to the transverse energy of the EM cluster. In CDF [1] electrons are reconstructed both in the central calorimeter and plug calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 2.8) while electrons in D0 [2] are reconstructed in the central and endcap calorimeters (|\u03b7| < 1.05 and 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2). Here \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2, and \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the proton direction. Both CDF and D0 require tight electrons in the central calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.05) for W \u2192 e\u03bd candidates. Electron energies are measured with the calorimeter, while electron direction is measured with tracking detectors, using tracks that are matched to electron cluster in the calorimeter.",

As the u quark tends to carry a higher fraction of the proton's momentum than the d quark, the W + (W \u2212 ) is boosted, on average, in the proton(anti-proton) direction.

Qualitatively the same type of asymmetry as a function of W boson rapidity is expected as in case of protonantiproton collisions. However the shape is expected to differ compared to proton-antiproton collisions since valence quarks and sea quarks have different momentum fraction distributions. Besides the total number of produced W + is expected to exceed that of W \u2212 since proton contains two valence u quarks and one valence d quark. The inclusive ratio of cross sections for W + and W \u2212 boson production was measured by CMS to be 1.43\u00b10.05 [8]. Moreover, the shapes of W + and W \u2212 p T spectra are expected to be different. Hence, they need to be measured and modeled separately. Recently ATLAS measured W boson p T spectrum [12], shown in Fig. 5, which can be considered first step towards understanding this observable at the precision needed for W mass measurement. Another input needed for W mass measurement is precise knowledge of parton distribution functions (PDFs). Since W charge asymmetry as a function of rapidity is driven by parton distributions, by measuring the asymmetry parton distribution functions can be constrained. Asymmetry in the W boson rapidity distribution has traditionally been studied in terms of charged lepton asymmetry, as W boson rapidity cannot be determined on the event-by-event basis, since neutrino escapes the detection. Charged lepton asymmetry, is the convolution of W \u00b1 production and V-A (vector-axial vector) decay asymmetries. Asymmetry is defined as a ratio of difference and sum of positively charged and negatively charged leptons. ATLAS [9], CMS [10] and LHCb [11] already performed first measurements of lepton charge asymmetries [13][14][15] Since sea quarks are involved in W boson production at the LHC, both charm and strange quarks, unlike at the Tevatron, contribute significantly. PDFs of both charm and strange quarks are currently very poorly constrained. Significant improvements in PDF precision would be needed for precise W mass measurement at the LHC.",
