Inclusive photon yields, scaled by the mean nuclear thickness function, are presented as a function of collision centrality and transverse momentum in two pseudorapidity intervals, |\u03b7| < 1.37 and 1.52 |\u03b7| < 2.37. The scaled yields in the two pseudorapidity intervals, as well as the ratios of the forward yields to those at midrapidity, are compared to the expectations from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. The measured cross sections agree well with the predictions for proton-proton collisions within statistical and systematic uncertainties. Both the yields and the ratios are also compared to two other pQCD calculations, one which uses the isospin content appropriate to colliding lead nuclei and another which includes nuclear modifications to the nucleon parton distribution functions.",

            "text": "Prompt photons are an important probe for the study of the hot, dense matter formed in the high-energy collision of heavy ions. Being colorless, they are transparent to the subsequent evolution of the matter and probe the very initial stages of the collision. Their production rates are therefore expected to be directly sensitive to the overall thickness of the colliding nuclear matter. The rates are also expected to be sensitive to modifications of the partonic structure of nucleons bound in a nucleus, which are implemented as nuclear modifications [1][2][3] to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) measured in deep-inelastic lepton-proton and proton-proton (pp) scattering experiments. These effects include nuclear shadowing (the depletion of the parton densities at low Bjorken x), antishadowing (an enhancement at moderate x), and the EMC effect [4]. Photon rates are also sensitive to final-state interactions in the hot and dense medium, via the conversion of high-energy quarks and gluons into photons through rescattering. This is predicted to lead to an increased photon production rate relative to standard expectations [5,6].",

            "text": "Prompt photons have two primary sources. The first is direct emission, which proceeds at leading order via quark-gluon Compton scattering qg \u2192 q\u03b3 or quark-antiquark annihilation qq \u2192 g\u03b3 . The second is the fragmentation contribution from the production of hard photons during parton fragmentation. At leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations, there is a meaningful distinction between the direct emission and fragmentation, but at higher orders the two cannot be unambiguously separated. To suppress the large background of nonprompt photons originating from the decays of neutral mesons in jets, as well as fragmentation photons, an isolation criterion is applied, in both measurements and calculations, to the transverse energy contained within a cone of well-defined size around the photon direction [7]. The isolation transverse energy requirement can be applied as a fraction of the photon transverse energy or as a constant transverse energy threshold. In either case, these requirements can be applied consistently to pQCD calculations so that prompt photon rates can be calculated reliably, as the isolation criterion naturally cuts off the collinear divergence of the fragmentation contribution [7].",

            "text": "Prompt photon rates have been measured extensively in both fixed-target and collider experiments. Fixed-target experiments include WA70 [8], UA6 [9], and E706 [10], and cover the range \u221a s = 23-38.8 GeV. In collider experiments, measurements were performed for proton-proton collisions at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (pp, \u221a s = 24-62.4 GeV) [11,12], and BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (pp at \u221a s = 200 GeV) [13,14], and for proton-antiproton collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (pp, \u221a s = 546-630 GeV) [15,16] and at the Fermilab Tevatron (pp, \u221a s = 0.63-1.96 TeV) [17][18][19][20]. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), ATLAS [21][22][23] and CMS [24,25] have measured isolated prompt photons in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In most cases, good agreement has been found with pQCD predictions at next-to-leading order (NLO), which are typically calculated using the JETPHOX package [7,26]. In lower-energy heavy-ion collisions, the WA98 experiment observed direct photons in lead-lead (Pb + Pb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 17.3 GeV [27], and the PHENIX experiment performed measurements of direct photon rates in gold-gold collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [28,29]. A variable often used to characterize the modification of rates of hard processes in a nuclear environment is the nuclear modification factor,",

Photon yields are measured over two ranges in the pseudorapidity of the photon, |\u03b7| < 1.37 (central) and 1.52 |\u03b7| < 2.37 (forward), and for photon transverse momenta in the interval 22 p T < 280 GeV. Comparisons of the yields with NLO pQCD calculations are also presented from JETPHOX 1.3 [26], in three configurations: pp collisions, Pb + Pb collisions (i.e., with the correct total isospin), and Pb + Pb after incorporating the EPS09 nuclear modification factors to the nucleon PDFs [1], derived from experimental data of lepton and proton scattering on nuclei. The ratios of the yields in the forward \u03b7 region to those in the central \u03b7 region (R FC\u03b7 ) are also presented.",

The x axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r,\u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

The EM section is a lead-liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with an accordion-shaped geometry. It is divided into a barrel region, covering |\u03b7| < 1.475, and two end-cap regions, covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The EM calorimeter has three primary sections, longitudinal in shower depth, called \"layers,\" to fully contain photon showers in the range of interest for this analysis. The first sampling layer is 3 to 5 radiation lengths deep and is segmented into fine strips of size \u03b7 = 0.003-0.006 (depending on \u03b7), which allows the discrimination of photons from the two-photon decays of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons. The second layer is 17 radiation lengths thick, sampling most of an electromagnetic shower, and has cells of size \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.025 \u00d7 0.025. The third layer has a material depth ranging from 4 to 15 radiation lengths and is used to correct for the leakage beyond the first two layers for high-energy electromagnetic showers. The total material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter ranges from 2.5 to 6 radiation lengths depending on pseudorapidity, except in the transition region between the barrel and end-cap regions (1.37 |\u03b7| < 1.52), in which the material is up to 11.5 radiation lengths (for which reason this transition region is excluded from this analysis). In front of the strip layer, a presampler is used to correct for energy loss in front of the calorimeter within the region |\u03b7| < 1.8. In test beam environments and in typical pp collisions, the photon energy resolution is found to have a sampling term of 10%-17%/ \u221a E [GeV]. Above 200 GeV, the global constant term in the photon energy resolution, estimated to be 1.2% \u00b1 0.6% (1.8% \u00b1 0.6%) in the barrel (end-cap) region for pp data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, starts to dominate [32].

Within |\u03b7| < 1.7, it is a sampling calorimeter of steel and scintillator tiles, with a depth of 7.4 hadronic interaction lengths.",

After the trigger requirement, events must satisfy a set of selection criteria. To suppress backgrounds, the relative time measured between the two MBTS counters is required to be less than 5 ns, and a primary vertex is required to be reconstructed in the inner detector. Minimum-bias events were triggered in the same data samples based on either a coincidence in the two ZDCs associated with a track in the inner detector, or a total of at least 50 GeV transverse energy deposited in the full calorimeter system.

However, in a heavy-ion collision, it is important to subtract the large UE from each event before the reconstruction procedure is applied. If it is not subtracted, photon transverse energies can be overestimated by up to several GeV in the most central events and the isolation transverse energy in a R = 0.3 cone can be overestimated by about 60 GeV. The procedure explained in Ref. [44] is used to estimate the energy density of the underlying event in each calorimeter cell. It iteratively excludes jets from consideration to obtain the average energy density in each calorimeter layer in intervals of \u03b7 = 0.1, after accounting for the elliptic modulation relative to the event plane angle measured in the FCal [35,45]. The algorithm provides the energy density as a function of \u03b7, \u03c6, and calorimeter layer, which allows the event-by-event subtraction of the UE in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.",

In the dense environment of the heavy-ion collision, the photon conversion reconstruction procedure is not performed, owing to the large number of combinatoric pairs in more central collisions. However, a substantial fraction of converted photons is still reconstructed by the photon algorithm as, for high-energy photon conversions, the electron and positron are typically close together when they reach the calorimeter, while their tracks typically originate at a radius too large to be well described by the tracking algorithm that is used for heavy-ion collisions. Thus, the photon sample analyzed here is a mix of converted and unconverted photons.

To account for these differences, a set of correction factors was derived, each of which changes the value of a simulated shower shape variable such that its mean value matches that of the corresponding measured distribution. For the measurements presented in this paper, the same correction factors, obtained by comparing pp simulations to the same quantities in data, are used with no modification for the heavy-ion environment. They were validated in the heavy-ion environment using electrons and positrons from reconstructed Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays from the same LHC run. It was observed that the magnitude and centrality dependence of the mean values of the shape variables are well described by simulations, within the limited size of the electron and positron sample. Figure 1 shows three typical distributions of shower shape variables for data from the 0%-10% and 40%-80% centrality intervals, each compared with the corresponding quantities in the simulation. The simulated distributions, after shower shape corrections, are all normalized to the number of counts in the corresponding data histogram. The data contain some admixture of neutral hadrons, so complete agreement should not be expected in the full distributions. The admixture of converted photons, which depends on the amount of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter, and thus the pseudorapidity of the photon, is not accounted for in the analysis, but there is good agreement of the shower shape variable distributions between data and simulation.",

To reduce the effect of statistical fluctuations, the variations as a function of p T are fit to constants over 22 p T < 44.1 GeV and 44.1 p T < 140 GeV, and the most significant variation is applied symmetrically to all points in that p T region. If the fit value is consistent with zero, then the variation is reduced by half to avoid overcounting the statistical fluctuations. For the forward-central ratios, the variations are fit with a single function over 22 p T < 70 GeV. In several cases, changing the isolation selection led to O(10%) changes that were clearly consistent with statistical fluctuations. In these cases, the variation was reduced to be 5%, similar to the adjacent centrality interval. The shower leakage corrections were varied by 1% of the measured photon p T in data, but not in simulation, to account for possible defects in the correction. (iv) Fragmentation contribution: Excluding the fragmentation photons from the simulation sample has typically less than a 2% effect on the final yields over the full p T range.",

(ii) Nontight definition: To assess the sensitivity to the choice of nontight criteria, which allow background into the analysis, the nontight definition was changed from four reversed conditions, to five (adding w s,tot ) and two (using just F side and w s,3 ). Similar to isolation criteria variations, fits to constant values in two p T intervals (and one interval for the forward-central ratios) were performed to smoothen the bin-to-bin statistical fluctuations. In the central \u03b7 interval, the variation is typically less than 5%, while it is 7% or less in the forward \u03b7 interval. (iii) Correlation of tight and isolation axes: The large inclusive-jet PYTHIA samples were used to study possible correlations between the tight selection criteria and the isolation transverse energy. This is characterized by calculating R bkg for the backgrounds from jets, where the candidate is not matched to a truth photon. After integrating over centrality and p T , R bkg was found to vary by about 10% in the central \u03b7 region and 20% in the forward \u03b7 region, albeit with large statistical uncertainties.

The overall variation from the known sources is typically found to be below 2%-3%, and is approximately constant in p T , but grows at high p T in the forward \u03b7 region. However, the extramaterial sample shows a small, but systematic, overall shift in the reconstructed energy scale which is approximately independent of p T and centrality, but is larger in the forward \u03b7 interval. Based on this, an overall uncertainty of 5% is assigned in the central \u03b7 region and in the forward region, except in the forward region above 88.2 GeV, where 7% is assigned. In the ratio, these errors are treated as fully uncorrelated between the two \u03b7 regions. (ii) Electron contamination: The contamination from W and Z bosons was estimated to be largest in the two p T intervals between 35 and 55.6 GeV and smaller in the other p T intervals. Because the calculation does not account for the different expected leakage of the electrons into the different sidebands, and because the number of Z bosons in the heavy-ion data is too low to determine this fully, 50% of the contamination has been assigned as an uncertainty, leading to a maximum of 4% in one p T interval in the forward region and smaller in all other intervals. (iii) Centrality: The uncertainty on T AA for each centrality interval is given in Table I and is shared by all p T and \u03b7 intervals for that centrality interval. In addition, the effect of reweighting the simulated FCal distribution generally has a less than 2% effect on the final yields, although the impact can increase to up to 4% at low p T in the forward \u03b7 interval. (iv) \u03b7 leakage: To address the effect of photons migrating in and out of the large \u03b7 intervals when calculating the efficiency, the true \u03b7 was also used for the efficiency calculations and was found to have a 1%-2% overall effect, reaching the larger end of this range in the forward \u03b7 region.",

THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS JETPHOX 1.3 is used for NLO pQCD calculations to compare with the fully corrected measurements. JETPHOX was found to agree well (within 10%-15%) withpp from the Tevatron [19,20] and pp data from the LHC [21][22][23]. It provides access to a wide range of existing PDF sets and performs calculations for direct photon production as well as for photons from fragmentation processes, both using an implementation of the experimental isolation selection built into the calculations. The primary pp calculations shown in this work use the CTEQ6.6 [49] proton PDF, with no nuclear modification, and the BFG II fragmentation functions [50]. They require less than 6 GeV isolation energy in a cone of R iso = 0.3 relative to the photon direction. The effect of hadronization on the final cross sections was estimated using the PYTHIA6.423 simulations to be 1% or less and is neglected in the results shown here. Scale uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalization (\u03bc R ), factorization (\u03bc F ), and fragmentation (\u03bc f ) scales by a factor of two, relative to the baseline result,",

However, it should be noted that where the data are more precise, in the central \u03b7 region, the PDF modifications implemented in EPS09 compensate for the suppression at higher p T seen in the Pb + Pb calculations, giving cross sections similar to the pp case.",

Evaluation of these ratios leads to the cancellation of several systematic effects on the efficiencies and bin-by-bin correction factors, mitigate the effect of the theoretical uncertainties, and fully remove the uncertainty on T AA . The results are compared to JETPHOX calculations for pp (yellow region), Pb + Pb (black line with gray area), and EPS09 nPDF (gray line with blue area). It is clear that there is some sensitivity to the nuclear PDF, primarily through the expected depletion of photon yields in the forward direction expected when including the neutron PDF to match the isospin composition of the lead nuclei. While the data are consistent with all three curves within the statistical and systematic uncertainties, a slight preference for the calculations incorporating isospin effects is observed.",

            "text": "In this paper, measured yields of isolated prompt photons in 0.14 nb \u22121 lead-lead collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC have been presented as a function of collision centrality (in four intervals from 40%-80% to 0%-10%) in two pseudorapidity regions (|\u03b7| < 1.37 and 1.52 |\u03b7| < 2.37) and for photon transverse momenta in the range 22 p T < 280 GeV. Photons were reconstructed using the large-acceptance, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic calorimeter, after an event-by-event subtraction of the average underlying event in each calorimeter layer in small \u03b7 intervals. Backgrounds stemming from neutral hadrons in jets are suppressed by a tight shower shape selection and by requiring no more than 6 GeV transverse energy in a cone of size R = 0.3 around each photon. The residual hadronic background is determined using a double-sideband method, and the remaining signal is corrected for efficiency and resolution, as well as electron contamination, to arrive at the per-event yield of photons as a function of p T in each \u03b7 and centrality interval. After scaling the yields by the mean nuclear thickness T AA , the p T spectrum in each \u03b7 and centrality interval is found to agree, within statistical and systematic uncertainties, with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations of proton-proton collisions. The data are also compared with calculations that assume the isospin of Pb + Pb collisions, as well as the calculations for Pb + Pb using the EPS09 nuclear modifications of the proton parton distribution functions. The ratios of the forward yields to those near midrapidity (R FC\u03b7 ) are also shown, and are compared to the corresponding ratios from JETPHOX. The present data are unable to distinguish between the three scenarios. However, the overall consistency of the measured yields with JETPHOX expectations for all centrality intervals demonstrates that photon yields in heavy-ion collisions scale as expected with the mean nuclear thickness. This provides further support for the interpretation of the clear modification of jet yields in Pb + Pb collisions as a function of centrality, relative to those measured in proton-proton collisions, as stemming from energy loss in the hot, dense medium [52].",
