            "text": "After the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, the investigation of its properties and compatibility with the standard model predictions is central to the physics program of the LHC experiments. Likewise, the study of the top quark is still relevant at the LHC, more than two decades after its discovery at the Tevatron. Top quarks and Higgs bosons are produced at the LHC on a large scale and share a deep connection based on the large mass of the top quark. Both particles provide an excellent laboratory in which to search for new physics: the measurement of their properties tests the foundations of the standard model; and they feature prominently in a variety of exotic signals. The coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark, a fundamental standard model parameter, can only be measured directly in processes where the two particles are produced together. The production of a Higgs boson together with one or two top quarks is also sensitive to several exciting new physics effects. A brief overview of the current experimental status of top quark and Higgs boson physics is presented using results from the CMS Collaboration.",

In about 100 years the experiments have evolved from very simple setups like the cloud chamber to large particle accelerators and colliders that take decades to build. Large international collaborations are needed to build and operate the experiments, as well as teams of theorists to develop the computing-intensive simulations and complex predictions required to study the data -a jump from the very small teams that worked at the inception of particle physics.",

The quark model was proposed in 1964, the same year that Peter Higgs submitted a paper on the subject of symmetry breaking. 1 The quark family was completed 31 years later, in 1995, when the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations at the Tevatron observed the top quark, 2,3 and it was the year 2012 when CERN reported the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC. 4,5 The Higgs boson is the first fundamental scalar particle observed, and a candidate to confirm the Higgs mechanism of mass generation via spontaneous electroweak (EWK) symmetry breaking. Since the Higgs boson discovery, the LHC experiments have found no other new particles or significant deviations from the SM predictions a . Martin Lewis Perl, who won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the \u03c4 lepton in 1995, said in 2014 that 'The easy elementary particle questions were answered thirty and forty years ago'. 7 The LHC now has to confront the hard questions, such as the description of gravity; the origin of the neutrino masses; the matter-anti-matter imbalance of the Universe; and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. For this, physics beyond the SM (BSM) are needed.",

During the first two years the full mass range from the LEP limit of 114.4 GeV, up to well above 600 GeV, was explored. Since the main Higgs boson production mode at the LHC is gluongluon fusion independently of the Higgs boson mass considered, the main channels explored for observation depended directly on the Higgs boson decay. The Higgs boson was observed in three channels: 8 H\u2192ZZ\u21924l, that has a clear four-lepton invariant mass peak over a small continuum background and it is considered as 'the golden channel' at the LHC; H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, that also has a mass peak on a smooth background, that profits from high-resolution calorimetry; and H\u2192WW\u2192 2l2\u03bd, where the mass peak reconstruction is not possible but that has a clear signature and sizeable branching ratio at 125 GeV -the second after H\u2192 bb. Several other Higgs decay channels have been carefully explored, including the H\u2192 bb channel, that suffers from high backgrounds and challenges presented by b-jet reconstruction, and the H\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 channel that requires a combination of multiple final state signatures. Sub-leading production modes, such as vector boson fusion, or associated production with a vector-boson, have also been studied.",

Decays of H\u2192VV (V=Z,W,\u03b3) were used to explore the spin and tensor structure of the Higgs boson. 9 The analysis used kinematic distributions of the decay products determined by the tensor structure of the HVV interactions. The number of kinematic variables available defined the strategy followed in each channel, and depends on the Higgs decay. The H\u2192 W W decay has limited sensitivity due to the undetected neutrinos in the dilepton final state. However for H\u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l, the complete final state can be reconstructed and the full kinematic information is accessible and condensed in a set of discriminants. Different BSM spin and CP hypotheses were tested in the H\u2192 W W and H\u2192 ZZ processes, such as several exotic spin-1 or spin-2 scenarios and BSM 0 \u2212 and 0 + h . As it is shown in Fig. 1, all spin-1 hypotheses have been excluded at more than 99.999% confidence level (CL).

There is an alternative mode that occurs at a lower rate, via EWK interaction: single top quark production. The production cross section of the different top quark processes at the Tevatron and the LHC is presented in Table 1. Top quarks decay almost exclusively as t\u2192Wb, and then the W boson decays subsequently as l\u03bd (32%), or qq (67%). Therefore, top quark final states are characterized by jets coming from b-quark decays and either one isolated lepton (e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ) and a neutrino, or a pair of light quarks. Final states with multiple top quarks therefore have very distinct experimental signals that use the full potential of the CMS experiment and all of its sub-detectors. The top quark legacy from the Run 1 of the LHC is vast, with more than 60 publications at the time of writing in CMS alone. It covers precise measurements of production cross sections, at the level of 3.5%; 16 extensive differential 17 studies, including boosted signatures; single top quark measurements, including the first observation of the tW production 18 and properties in t-channel; first studies of very rare top quark processes, including four top quark production and the first observation of ttV (V=W,Z); 19 and high precision measurements of top quark properties. Among the latter, the flagship is the top quark mass, m t .",

The top quark mass that is measured in classic analyses relates directly with the value of the top quark mass used in the simulation and has to be translated to theoretical fixedorder calculations of m t . At this level of precision, the discussion on how to perform this translation and the uncertainty associated with it becomes very important and requires large input from theorists. Already with the very early data of Run 2 the inclusive top pair production cross section was measured by CMS. In the dilepton final state (where both top quarks decay to leptonically decaying W bosons), with only 42pb \u22121 and a simple selection, the tt cross section was measured with less than 5% of uncertainty. 21 Many other cross section measurements, using increasingly larger sets of dat, followed. At the moment of writing, there are measurements for the tt cross section using dilepton, lepton+jets, and all jets final states at 13 TeV, with uncertainties below 4%. Figure 4 presents a summary of some of the inclusive cross section measurements for tt production by the CMS Collaboration. Differential measurements have also been performed with Run 2 data, first in the lepton+jets final state, 22 which has the largest rate, followed by dilepton and all jets final states. Distributions of global event variables (such as missing transverse momentum, or jet multiplicity) as well as distributions related to the tt system like the p T of the top quark, corrected for detector events to particle and parton level, are already available. Single top quark production, once a rare process that was observed for the first time in 2009, could already be observed also with the first 42pb \u22121 of collisions during Run 2. 23 In order to properly measure top quark properties, large sets of well-understood data are needed, and for that reason the time for such measurements based on Run 2 data has yet to arrive. Two fundamental measurements, those of the mass and the width of the top, however, are already available in Run 2. The measurement of the top quark width 24 sets a bound of 0.6 \u2264 \u0393 t \u2264 2.5 GeV (the NLO SM prediction is 1.35 GeV) at 13 TeV comparing data with different \u0393 t hypothesis. The first mass measurement 25 at 13 TeV, in the lepton+jets channel, used a classic template method and obtained a value of m t = 172.62 \u00b1 0.38(stat. + JSF) \u00b1 0.70(syst.) GeV. This result is consistent with the Run 1 measurements, as it can be seen in Fig. 5.",

With the full 2016 dataset, ttZ is observed with 9.9\u03c3 of significance and ttW with 5.5\u03c3, establishing the two processes independently for the first time.

So far, there are no clear tensions with the SM predictions in the top quark sector at the LHC experiments, with one exception. In differential measurements there is generally good agreement with NNLO predictions and NLO generators. However, the top quark p T spectrum is persistently found to be softer in data than in the simulation. This effect was observed during Run 1, and it is still present in Run 2. This effect is observed in all channels, in tt and single top t-channel production, and beyond the TeV scale in the boosted regime. The top quark p T description is improved by higher order calculations (NNLO providing a better description than NLO) and simulation at higher orders (NLO generators seeing a smaller discrepancy than LO).

The Higgs boson couples to mass, and therefore its coupling to the top quark, whose mass is close to the EWK symmetry breaking scale, is expected to be very strong in the SM. Moreover, the precise measurement of the top quark mass and the W boson mass set constraints on the expected mass of a SM Higgs boson via EWK fits. 28 Additionally, the top quark radiative corrections can drive the Higgs boson self-coupling towards negative values, potentially leading to an unstable vacuum that would need new phenomena to be stabilized. Hence, a precise measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson and the mass of the top quark would allow for conclusions on the fate of the Universe via the analysis of the vacuum stability. 29 The top quark has an impact in the Higgs sector: it is involved in the main Higgs boson production mode at the LHC, gluon-gluon fusion, and in one of the main Higgs boson decays, Higgs to \u03b3\u03b3, in both cases via loop at leading order. This makes possible to experimentally constrain the top-Higgs coupling, an excellent probe of the SM consistency, by studying the gluon-gluon fusion production and H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. Within uncertainties, the current measurement of this coupling is so far consistent with the SM expectations.

The tH production is highly suppressed in the SM but its rate could be affected by anomalous top-Higgs couplings. In particular, a negative value of the Higgs boson coupling to the top quark (assuming the SM value for the coupling to vector bosons) could increase the tHq cross section by a factor of 15. Single top plus Higgs is then sensitive to the size of the coupling, and to the relative sign between \u03ba V and \u03ba t . Negative values \u03ba t are excluded by the current measurements in gluon-gluon fusion and H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, but this exclusion is made under the assumption that no new particles contribute to the loops, and that there are no BSM decays.",
