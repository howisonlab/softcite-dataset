A depletion in the rate at the far site would indicate mixing between and a sterile particle. No anomalous depletion in the reconstructed energy spectrum is observed. Assuming oscillations occur at a single mass-squared splitting, a fit to the neutral-and charged-current energy spectra limits the fraction of oscillating to a sterile neutrino to be below 0.68 at 90% confidence level. A less stringent limit due to a possible contribution to the measured neutral-current event rate at the far site from e appearance at the current experimental limit is also presented.",

            "text": "Several experiments observing charged-current (CC) interactions of neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for and e disappearance as the neutrinos propagate from the point of production [1][2][3][4][5]. The Super-Kamiokande experiment has reported extensively on the disappearance of produced in the atmosphere [2]. Measurements of solar e showed that the disappearance of those neutrinos is due to matter enhanced conversions [3]. The KamLAND reactor experiment provided clear evidence for \" e mixing [4]. These results are conventionally interpreted as mixing among the active neutrino flavors that couple to the electroweak current. Precise measurements of the Z boson decay width indicate there are only three light active neutrinos [6], but they do not exclude the existence of ''sterile'' neutrinos s that do not couple to the electroweak current. Sterile neutrinos could help resolve several outstanding problems in particle physics and astrophysics. For example, sterile neutrinos with masses on the order of 1 eV can participate in the seesaw mechanism to introduce neutrino masses [7] and can also aid in heavy element nucleosynthesis in supernovae [8]. The SNO experiment has shown that the total flux of active neutrinos from the sun agrees with the expectation from solar models [9], thereby limiting the extent to which the first or second neutrino mass eigenstates could couple to a sterile neutrino. While the Super-Kamiokande experiment excludes pure ! s and favors pure ! oscillations in its analysis of atmospheric neutrinos, an admixture of the two possibilities is allowed [10] and has attracted considerable attention in the literature [11].",

If this deficit is due solely to conversions of to \u00fe e , then the rate of neutral-current (NC) interactions at the far detector remains unchanged from the nonoscillation prediction. Alternatively, if any convert to a sterile state, then the NC rate would be suppressed and the reconstructed energy spectrum would be distorted. In this Letter we report the first measurement of the total active neutrino rate using a precisely known long baseline and neutrinos produced with an accelerator. The reconstructed energy spectra for NC and CC interactions are used to limit the fraction of converting to s by fitting them to a model of oscillations between , , e , and s dominated by the atmospheric mass-squared splitting.",
