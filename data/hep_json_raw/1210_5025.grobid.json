Because of large helicity suppression, R \u03c0 e/\u00b5 is uniquely sensitive to contributions from non-(V \u2212 A) physics, making this decay a particularly suitable subject of study. Even at current precision, the experimental value of B \u03c0e2 provides the most accurate test of lepton universality available. During runs in 2008-10, PEN has accumulated over 2 \u00d7 10 7 \u03c0 e2 events; a comprehensive maximum-likelihood analysis is currently under way. The new data will also lead to improved precision of the earlier PIBETA results on radiative \u03c0 and \u00b5 decays.",

Prime examples are: charged Higgs in theories with multiple Higgs bosons, PS leptoquarks in theories with dynamical symmetry breaking, classes of vector leptoquarks, parameters of certain SUSY partner particles, as well as non-zero neutrino masses and their mixing (Refs. [4,5] give recent reviews of the subject). Thus, \u03c0 e2 decay complements direct searches for new physics at modern colliders.",

Assignment of detected events to either of the two processes, or to a background process, is made within a comprehensive, blind and unbinned maximum likelihood analysis (MLA) [14]. Key to achieving the goal uncertainty is in the control of the systematics. One among many powerful tools available to develop reliable probability density functions for the MLA is provided by the beam counter waveform (wf) digitizer data, helping us to obtain clean samples of \u03c0 e2 events (two pulses in the AT-wf) and sequential \u03c0\u2192\u00b5\u2192e decay events (three pulses in the AT-wf). The procedure and results are summarily illustrated in Fig. 1(b,c). Another key component in the analysis is the comprehensive GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment that produces synthetic data fully equivalent to the measured data [15].",
