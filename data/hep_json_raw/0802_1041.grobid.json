It was designed to study neutrino oscillations and carry out searches for the decay of the nucleon. The Super-Kamiokande experiment began in 1996 and in the ensuing decade of running has produced extremely important results in the fields of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations, along with setting stringent limits on the decay of the nucleon and the existence of dark matter and astrophysical sources of neutrinos. Perhaps most crucially, Super-Kamiokande for the first time definitively showed that neutrinos have mass and undergo flavor oscillations. This chapter will summarize the published scientific output of the experiment with a particular emphasis on the atmospheric neutrino results.",

The second was the IMB experiment [3,4] which was located in the Morton Salt mine in Ohio. Grand Unified models such as SU(5) [5] predicted that the proton would decay at a rate visible by modest size detectors and both of these experiments were originally built to search nucleon decay into the mode favored by SU (5) which is p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 .",

At the same time two detectors made of iron the NUSEX [6] and Frejus [7] experiments saw a result which was consistent with the expectation but with much lower statistics. Super-Kamiokande was designed to definitively determine whether or not oscillations were indeed taking place.",

Previous generations of experiments had not seen as many neutrinos from the sun as predicted by solar models. With a large mass, good energy resolution, and the ability to point neutrinos back to the sun in real-time, Super-Kamiokande was designed first of all to confirm the effect with high statistics and then to determine what the parameters of oscillation were.",

Selection steps are performed to remove the background from non-neutrino induced interactions. For example, the outer detector region is used as a veto to reject cosmic-ray muons. Using the time and charge information at each photo-tube, reconstruction algorithms are applied to the data to determine a vertex for the Cherenkov light and any rings associated with the particles of the interaction. Additional likelihood-based algorithms are used to determine the properties of the particles that generated the light including their type, momenta and directions. These reconstructed physics quantities are then used for analysis. More detail about the acquisition and analysis reconstruction techniques can be found in Refs. [8,12] and [13].",

In this paper, 535 days of data were analyzed and subdivided into sub-GeV and multi-GeV e-like and mu-like events. In this data set, a strong suppression of upward going event from muonneutrino interactions was observed. This was quantified in terms of an asymmetry defined as A = (U \u2212D)/(U +D) where U is the number of upward-going events (\u22121 < cos \u0398 < \u22120.2) and D is the number of downward-going events (0.2 < cos \u0398 < 1). Due to the isotropic nature of the cosmic rays this asymmetry is expected to be close to zero. For the electron-neutrino sample this was found to be the case. For the muon-like events the asymmetry was found to be:",

First, there would also be a reduction in the neutral current sample. Second, because of a difference in the forward scattering cross-sections in the two cases, the normal charge current oscillations would be suppressed at high energies. This suppression is known as the \"matter effect.\" A fit was done to the data samples looking for these effects and was not seen.

How- ever, we know there are three flavors of neutrinos and one can write down a three-flavor mixing matrix with three mixing angles. The two that have been measured (\u03b8 12 and \u03b8 23 ) control solar and atmospheric mixing respectively. The third, as yet unmeasured, mixing angle \u03b8 13 would allow all three of these neutrinos to oscillate into each-other, producing small amounts of high energy electron neutrino appearance in the upward going data. The question of the value of \u03b8 13 is particularly pressing since if it is extremely small or zero it will not be possible to measure CP violation in the neutrino sector using the oscillation technique. In order to measure or constrain the value of \u03b8 13 using the Super-K data set, a fit was performed using full three flavor oscillation probabilities, taking into account the resonance effects that can occur in the earth for such oscillations. The data was binned so as to be maximally sensitive to upward going electrons in the relevant energy regions. As detailed in Ref. [22] no evidence for non-zero \u03b8 13 was found. A plot showing the Super-K \u03b8 13 allowed region overlaid with the exclusion region for the CHOOZ reactor experiment is shown in Fig. 8. Search for tau lepton appearance [23] None of the previous analyses explicitly searched for the appearance of the tau lepton from oscillations. The number of tau leptons in the data sample is expected to be small. Only on the order of 80 events with tau leptons were expected to be produced in fiducial volume of Super-Kamiokande during the SK-I running period. In Ref. [23] an explicit search for tau lepton appearance was undertaken.",

Super-Kamiokande is sensitive mostly to neutrinos from the 8 B branch of the pp nuclear fusion chain in solar burning. At very low energies the experiment is dominated by radioactive backgrounds. However, above approximately 4 MeV the detector can pick-out the scattering of solar neutrinos off atomic electrons which make Cherenkov light in the tank. The 8 B and rarer HEP neutrinos have a spectrum which ends near 20 MeV. Unlike previous radio-chemical experiments which relied on extraction of isotopes, Super-Kamiokande collects its data in real time and the electrons which are scattered by neutrinos point in a direction that is correlated with the sun. Therefore, by plotting the direction between low energy events in the tank and the Sun, one can pick out a peak containing solar neutrinos. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 10 which the cos of the angle between the events and the sun are plotted.",

During the day, neutrinos from the sun travel down from above, traveling through very little earth. While during the night they travel from the other side of the Earth, in some parts of the year actually passing through the outer core. This is relevant because, for some regions of oscillation space, a regeneration of the original flux can happen inside high density materials. In this paper, no statistically significant sign of this was seen, thereby excluding parts of the oscillation space previously allowed by other experiments. At the same time, an analysis of the measured energy spectrum shape was published in Ref. [26] using the 504 day data set.
