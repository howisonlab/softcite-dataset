It is also entering a phase of precision measurements. This is what motivates the NUFACT 11 conference which prepares the future of long baseline neutrino experiments. In this paper, we report the status of experimental neutrino physics. We focus mainly on absolute mass measurements, oscillation parameters and future plans for oscillation experiments [1].",

            "text": "Over the last 15 years experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos oscillate and therefore mix and have masses, however few oscillation parameters are well measured. In addition, their absolute mass scale is still only described by upper limits. Finally, we do not know the nature of neutrino masses. Therefore despite the tremendous results of the last decade, there is still a vast open field with many discoveries in the making. In this paper we present the status of the absolute mass scale measurements and oscillation parameters measurements, and describe several possible new experiments for improving these measurements. This paper has been updated to take into account the results presented at the Neutrino 2012 conference in June 2012 in Kyoto [2].",

Current cosmological bounds are down around M \u03bd < 0.17 \u2212 0.33 eV [4,5] and new data from the Planck observatory should be available soon [6].

Neutrino oscillations is governed by a 3 \u00d7 3 unitary mixing matrix and by mass differences. The mixing angles (Fig. 3, left) have all been measured but even though the two mass splittings have also been measured (Fig. 3, right), the mass hierarchy and the CP violating phase are still unknown.

[15]. A hint that \u03b8 13 was non-zero did however come from global fit of available oscillation data [16]. In June of 2011, T2K presented their first electron neutrino appearance measurement, six events on a predicted background of 1.5 \u00b1 0.3(syst.) indicating a non-zero value of \u03b8 13 at 2.5\u03c3 [17]. The analysis was not strictly speaking blind but all the cuts for the electron neutrino event selection in the Super-Kamiokande detector were decided well before T2K even started taking data. At Neutrino 2012, all the data up to May 15th 2012 were analyzed and presented [18]. Ten events are observed in the far detector and \u03b8 13 is excluded at 3.2\u03c3. At 90% C.L., the T2K results is sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.104 +0.60 \u22120.45 for \u03b4 CP = 0 and normal hierarchy. The T2K selected \u03bd e candidates are shown in Fig. 4. Two weeks after T2K released their results, the MINOS collaboration presented results which disfavour \u03b8 13 = 0 at 89% C.L. with 62 events on a background of 49.6 \u00b1 7.0(stat) \u00b1 2.7(syst.)

In the far detector, a clear deficit of 8.0% is found by comparing a total of 17102 observed events with an expectation based on the near detector measurement assuming no oscillation. From this deficit, a rate-only analysis obtains sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.113 \u00b1 0.013(stat.) \u00b1 0.019(syst.). The neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 is measured with a significance of 4.9 standard deviation. The RENO experiment is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Korea and the Korea Neutrino Research Center selected as a Science Research Center by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF). Some of us have been supported by a fund from the BK21 of NRF. We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Site and the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd. (KHNP). We thank KISTI's providing computing and network resources through GSDC, and all the technical and administrative people who greatly helped in making this experiment possible.  Left, Daya Bay data: Top: Measured prompt energy spectrum of the far hall (sum of three ADs) compared with the no-oscillation prediction from the measurements of the two near halls. Spectra were background subtracted. Uncertainties are statistical only. Bottom: The ratio of measured and predicted no-oscillation spectra. The red curve is the best-fit solution with sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.089 obtained from the rate-only analysis. The dashed line is the no-oscillation prediction [21,22]. Right, RENO data: Observed spectrum of the prompt signals in the far detector compared with the non-oscillation predictions from the measurements in the near detector. The backgrounds shown in the inset are subtracted for the far spectrum. The background fraction is 5.5% (2.7%) for far (near) detector. Errors are statistical uncertainties only. Bottom: The ratio of the measured spectrum of far detector to the non-oscillation prediction [23]. 3.2. Measurement of the solar parameters: \u2206m 2 21 and \u03b8 12 The solar parameters are now well constrained by both solar and reactor data, and the newly measured value of \u03b8 13 further reduces the uncertainty of this measurement. A very good summary of current data is presented by T. Schwetz [25]   data consists of 54 electron neutrino events, while, according to the measurements in the MINOS Near Detector, 49.1 \u00b1 7.0(stat) \u00b1 2.7(syst) background events were expected. Hence the observed number of events is in agreement with background expectations within 0.7\u03c3 and the hint for a non-zero value of \u03b8 13 present in previous data [17] has largely disappeared. In fact, we see that once we include the new MINOS data in our analysis, a smaller best fit point of \u03b8 13 is obtained and, as a result, the hint for \u03b8 13 is less significant than before: for both hierarchies we find only a 0.8\u03c3 hint when using new MINOS data versus 1.3\u03c3 obtained with the previous MINOS appearance data, see e.g. [18] for a discussion. Atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande I+II+III described in the previous section implies a best fit point very close to \u03b8 13 = 0 [12], with \u2206\u03c7 = 0.0(0.3) for \u03b8 13 = 0 for NH (IH). However, in the combination with MINOS disappearance and appearance data we even find a slight preference for \u03b8 13 > 0, with \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1.6(1.9) at \u03b8 13 = 0 for NH (IH). As shown in Fig. 4 this happens due to a small mismatch of the best fit values for |\u2206m 3 31 | at \u03b8 13 = 0, which can be resolved by allowing for non-zero values of \u03b8 13 [3]. This is similar to the hint for \u03b8 13 > 0 coming from a slight tension between solar and KamLAND data, see Ref. [1]. Therefore, the hint for \u03b8 13 > 0 from atmospheric + LBL data becomes slightly stronger compared to the previous data.",

The value of the mass splittings are well known but the ordering of the masses, (the mass hierarchy), is still unknown. Discovering the mass hierarchy is one of the goals of future experiments not only because it obscures the CP violation measurement, but if neutrino masses were inverted it would be the first time that fermions do not have increasing masses with increasing generation number.",

They are subsequently allowed to decay in flight to create pure (\u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd e ) and (\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e ) beams respectively. The golden channel of the neutrino factory is \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 , but since \u03bd \u00b5 are also present in the beam, measurements similar to today's (electron neutrino appearance and muon neutrino disappearance) are also possible. The presence of \u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd e , and\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e in different trains is perfect to study CP violation since we can directly compare the oscillation of a neutrino to the oscillation of the anti-neutrino. Furthermore, because \u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd e ,\u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e are present in the beam, the near detector of a neutrino factory would be able to measure all four types of neutrinos cross-sections and reduce systematics considerably. In order to see oscillations, the far detector needs to be magnetized to differentiate \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 from an interacting\u03bd \u00b5 . A magnetized iron detector is envisaged as far detector. It was found that an optimal neutrino factory given the current value of \u03b8 13 uses 10 GeV muons and a baseline of 2200 km [36,37].",

Only a year ago, nobody knew if \u03b8 13 was even large enough to be measured, yet today the precision on \u03b8 13 is already better than the precision on \u03b8 23 . With this measurement the prospect of measuring the mass hierarchy and especially the CP phase \u03b4 is better than ever and the years to come will be fascinating. With the announcement on July 4th 2012 that the Higgs was probably found, the remaining questions in the Standard Model (Fig. 8) are in neutrinos physics.",
