            "text": "The coherent Bragg scattering of photons converted from solar axions inside crystals would boost the signal for axionphoton coupling enhancing experimental sensitivity for these hypothetical particles. Knowledge of the scattering angle of solar axions with respect to the crystal lattice is required to make theoretical predications of signal strength. Hence, both the lattice axis angle within a crystal and the absolute angle between the crystal and the Sun must be known. In this paper, we examine how the experimental sensitivity changes with respect to various experimental parameters. We also demonstrate that, in a multiple-crystal setup, knowledge of the relative axis orientation between multiple crystals can improve the experimental sensitivity, or equivalently, relax the precision on the absolute solar angle measurement. However, if absolute angles of all crystal axes are measured, we find that a precision of 2 \u2022 \u2212 4 \u2022 will suffice for an energy resolution of \u03c3 E = 0.04E and a flat background. Finally, we also show that, given a minimum number of detectors, a signal model averaged over angles can substitute for precise crystal angular measurements, with some loss of sensitivity.",

In this section we discuss conclusions 671 derived from these studies. Although these conclusions 672 are derived for the case of Ge detectors, they will apply 673 to other solid state detectors. 674 An angle-averaged axion signal pattern can be used 675 to analyze an experiment, if there are more than about 676 15 identical detectors (Sec. 5). However, the sensitivity 677 to axion-photon coupling \u03bb in this averaging method is a 678 factor of 3 to 4 worse than measuring all detector angles 679 precisely, if the latter is feasible. 680 The main goal of the Majorana Demonstrator is to 681",

            "text": "Therefore, during the data analysis one could artificially reduce the effective mass of the heavier detectors to 0.6 kg by randomly eliminating roughly one third of all events. This would provide more than 50 identical detectors of 0.6 kg each. This analysis can be carried out without any significant experimental efforts beyond the0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 program. For some experiments, the relative angles between detectors can be measured well, but only poor knowledge of absolute angles to the Sun for each detector is available. The relative angle method in Sect. 4 was demonstrated to be capable of improving experimental sensitivity to axions in comparison to the case of little angular information. This improvement is approximately 30% for four detectors with a \u00b12 \u2022 relative angle precision and it increases with the number of detectors deployed in an experiment. The studies presented here were aimed at providing guidance for current and near-future experiments. A precision measurement of the absolute solar angle is best. With an energy resolution of \u03c3 E = 0.04E, our study shows that a measurement of the absolute angle within 2 \u2022 \u22124 \u2022 is sufficient. (Note, the CDMS experiment measured their crystal angles to approximately 3 \u2022 [28].) Importantly, with such an angular precision, an experiment can use the profile likelihood method with nominal critical values from a \u03c7 2 (1) distribution, avoiding extensive Monte Carlo studies. detectors, the likelihood functions for individual detec-752 tors are multiplied to obtain the joint likelihood func-753 tion, as,754",

(A.4) The joint likelihood L is maximized against all unknown parameters in the denominator, but only against the nuisance parameters of background and angles in the numerator. Maximizing L is equivalent to minimizing the negative log likelihood function, \u22122 lnL. The signal rate expressed by Eq. 6 has a very complicated dependence on the detector azimuthal angle \u03c6 and the instantaneous position of the Sun. Therefore, the minimization of \u22122 lnL against \u03c6 is performed on a n D dimension grid of \u03c6-angles. The effect of the step size of the angle grid was studied for Fig. 7, where various step sizes ranging from 0.5 \u2022 to 2.0 \u2022 were tested and compared. Limited quantitative effect of the step size was observed but the conclusion was not affected. While a smaller step size would provide more precise quantitative results, its computational requirement would be overwhelming for multiple-detector studies. The data points in Fig. 7 used a 0.5 \u2022 step size. With the exception of Fig. 7, the default angle grid step size is 2.0 \u2022 , which is smaller than what was used by SOLAX (Fig.2 of [26]) and COSME (Fig.4 of [27]) experiments when they scanned all possible detector angles. Given that the assumed systematic uncertainty on the relative angle is \u00b12.0 \u2022 in Sect. 4, a smaller step size might be more preferable and remains a possible direction of improvement for future work. The extent of the angle grid corresponds to the assumed systematic uncertainty on each angle. For a specific \u03bb 0 and angle grid position, \u22122 lnL is locally minimized againstb, using MINUIT [54] in ROOT [51]. Maintaining the same \u03bb 0 , the local minima on the entire angle grid are then compared to find sup{L(\u03bb 0 ,b, \u03c6);b, \u03c6}, which only depends on \u03bb 0 .
