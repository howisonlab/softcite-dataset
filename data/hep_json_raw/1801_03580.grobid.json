Its discovery would demonstrate that the lepton number is not a symmetry of nature and would provide us with unique information on the nature and mass of the neutrinos. Among the experimental techniques employed in the investigation of this rare process, thermal detectors fulfill the requirements for a powerful search, showing an excellent energy resolution and the possibility of scaling to very large masses. In this work, we review the long chain of bolometric experiments based on TeO 2 crystals that were and continue to be carried out at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy), searching for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 of 130 Te. We illustrate the progress and improvements achieved in almost thirty years of measurements and compare the various performance and results. We describe the several steps that led to the CUORE detector, the latest of this series and presently in data taking, and we highlight the challenges that a next bolometric experiment will face in order to further improve the sensitivity, especially concerning the background abatement. Finally, we emphasize the advantages of 130 Te in the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 with a further future experiment.",

In particular, paratellurite is commercially produced at the industrial scale and employed in ultrasonic light deflectors and in laser light modulators [55], thanks to its acoustic and optical properties. The crystals have mechanical and optical characteristics fully compliant with the requirements for the use as thermal detectors. Moreover, the numerous improvements in preparing the TeO 2 powder and in growing the crystals allow the production of almost perfect large specimens (bubblefree, crack-free and twin-free 8 ) from which it is possible to construct bolometers with masses of the order of 750 g [56,57] or more [58,59]. It is fundamental to notice that the use of a material inside a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 detector imposes very stringent constraints in terms of radiopurity. Therefore, tight limits must be set for the crystal impurity content in order to get an acceptable background rate. TeO 2 also satisfies these requirements.

In 1995, \u223c 4 months of active live-time could be collected [75].

A more compact assembly of the crystals was adopted. The fundamental module was no more constituted by a single crystal, but by each plane of the tower (bottom panel in the figure). The new design allowed both for a better anti-coincidence analysis and for the reinforcement of the Roman lead shield. The thickness of the lead layer between the MC and the detector was increased by 5 cm and a new lateral shield of 2 cm minimum thickness was added. Moreover, the PTFE masks were substituted by small PTFE pieces, with a consequent reduction of the material facing the crystals. New electric connections with copper pins avoided the use of the soldering indium (rich in the contaminant 115 In), since the gold wires from the thermistors could now be crimped to the pins, and an anti-vibration damping method was implemented to reduce mechanical noise. Finally, both the crystals and the copper were cleaned in order to reduce their own radioactive contamination and that coming from the production process.",

The main goal remained the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2, but this experiment would have allowed also studies on the interaction of Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS) and solar axions and on rare decays. The name chosen for the new detector was CUORE, acronym for Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (Italian for 'heart'). The realization of such a complex cryogenic setup would have required the support of a numerous (international) collaboration and many years of preparation. As a first step towards CUORE, a simpler (and much less expensive) experiment was also proposed. The original idea foresaw an array made of 100 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 cm 3 crystals for a total mass of about 75 kg, hence the name Cuoricino (Italian for \"small CUORE\"). Cuoricino had not to be purely considered a proof of concept for CUORE, but an independent experiment as well. Apart from becoming by far the new largest cryogenic detector, Cuoricino would have contained about 20 kg of 130 Te, a mass three times larger than the whole MiDBD and, more in general, larger than the \u03b2\u03b2-isotope mass of any other 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiment running at the time.",

The CAW detector was the result of an intense program of optimization of both the single module structure and its assembly procedure during the tower build up. The new structure reduced the amount of copper by a factor \u223c 2. At the same time, the PTFE supports were moved to the vertices of the crystals. In the first attempt, used during the CAW 1 run, too much stress on the vertices actually caused cracks of the crystals. Therefore a further modification of the PTFE parts was implemented and used during the CAW 2 run (Fig. 17). The new structure relaxed the tension on the critical points, but introduced a larger amount of material. Considering that the hypothesis of thermal stress release from PTFE was still unsolved, in the end it was opted for smaller clamps, following the original idea, but adding small stress-relieving holes on the vertices to avoid the risk of cracks. This design became the official choice for CUORE and has been ever since (see Fig. 20).",

The adopted solution consisted of a large custom cryogen-free cryostat cooled by 5 Pulse Tube Refrigerators and a high-power 3 He/ 4 He Dilution Unit [109,110]  (Fig. 25). This cryostat comprises six nested high-purity-copper vessels, the innermost of which encloses an experimental volume of about 1 m 3 . At its center, the Tower Support Plate holding the detector is attached to a dedicated suspension system in order to reduce the amount of vibrations. To avoid radioactive background, only a few construction materials were employed and almost 7 t of lead had to be cooled below 4 K. The inner shields include the Top Lead and the Lateral Lead, the latter being made of ancient Roman lead [111]. Outside, the whole cryostat is protected from the environmental radioactivity by the external shield made of a 18 cm polyethylene + 2 cm H 3 BO 3 + 25 cm lead shield on the side and 25 cm lead + 20 cm borated polyethylene shield on the bottom.

The first results on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search, covering the interval between May and September 2017, for a total TeO 2 exposure of 86.3 kg yr, have recently been released [114]. These indicate that a background in line with the expectations has been reached, with the value of (0.014 \u00b1 0.002) counts keV \u22121 kg \u22121 yr \u22121 observed in the ROI. The average energy resolution of the detector at Q \u03b2\u03b2 is (7.7 \u00b1 0.5) keV, with an observed improvement during the data collection thanks to a data-quality optimization campaign. A further improvement down to \u223c 5 keV is foreseen by further optimizing the experimental operating conditions and through improvements of the analysis. The successful commissioning and operation of CUORE mark a major step in the application of the bolometric technique and demonstrates the feasibility of future large-mass bolometer arrays for rare event searches. Table II summarizes the main features of the chain of bolometric experiments presented in this work. 15 The series of significant improvements appears here evident. Passing from the 6 g crystal to CUORE, the detector mass has increased of more than a factor 10 5 . At the same time the background rate has been constantly reduced and the resolution improved, reaching values comparable with those of the best performing detectors. CUORE is expected to fully exploit the potentiality of the calorimetric technique. The strict protocol designed for the detector construction is the result of an extensive and continuous R&D program, while the cryogenic system represents a milestone in the dilution refrigeration technology. The successful operation of CUORE has opened the way to one of the most sensitive searches for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and to the possibility for tonne-scale bolometric experiments.",

No evidence for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 of 130 Te has been found so far. However, as shown in Table III, these and the previous experiments allowed to set more and more stringent limits on the process. Starting from the early measurements almost thirty years ago, the evolution of the limit on the decay half-life of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 of 130 Te proceeded in parallel with that of the bolometric measurements. The first results presented to the scientific community were immediately competitive 16 and the subsequent improvements translated in an increase of sensitivity of several orders of magnitude.",

The tightest limit on 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 from a direct measurement was instead 2.8 \u2022 10 18 yr from a measurement with a CdTe detector [17] (the result 1.2 \u2022 10 21 yr from Ref.

However, this option is ultimately constrained by the experimental volume inside the cryostat. On the other side, the use of TeO 2 crystals enriched in 130 Te seems a viable path to be followed and the first results in this direction are promising. The recent run of two TeO 2 enriched crystal (\u223c 92% of 130 Te) in the Hall C DR [124] proved that performance comparable to those of CUORE-0 are achievable. The crystals (of mass \u223c 435 g each) showed a FWHM energy resolution at the 208 Tl line of 6.5 and 4.3 keV, respectively. At the same time, the assessment of the crystal internal contamination indicated a relatively small presence of 238 U, although (10 \u2212 20) times larger than that of the CUORE crystals (see Sec. III C 4), while only an upper limit was obtained for 232 Th (within a factor 2 with respect to the CUORE crystals).

However, in order to try to improve the single detector performance, a better understanding of the bolometer behavior is crucial. Several studies aiming at building a working thermal model for the CUORE bolometers have been carried out over the years [125][126][127] and soon a large amount of data will be available thanks to CUORE, which will provide useful information in this direction. Anyway, since at present we do not know the level of improvement we can expect or how much time will be needed in order to obtain practical effects for the experimental search, no further improvement on this parameter will be considered.

In particular, this was found to be mainly imputable to the cryostat shields (\u223c 74.4% [23]), which were still the old ones of the Hall A DR. In CUORE, an extensive screening campaign preceded the selection and procurement of the materials used in the construction, not only of the detector, but also of the cryostat. Different material assay techniques allowed a deep investigation of the role of natural contaminants (especially 238 U and 232 Th with the respective progenies) and of cosmogenically activated contaminants ( 60 Co, 110 Ag and 110m Ag [128]) which are expected to yield a contribution in the ROI. The strict selection of the CUORE components took into account both bulk and surface contaminations, the latter possibly occurring during the part machining and cleaning, or during exposure to contaminated air. 20 As a result of this work, the sources that could give sizable contribution to the CUORE BI were identified to be (Fig. 28): \u2022 the cosmogenically activated isotopes in crystals and copper parts (both detector frames and Tower Support Plate + MC plate and vessel, see Fig. 25);",

These foresee the use of a dual readout approach based on the simultaneous measurement of heat and light signals, the latter being collected by a thin Ge or Si slab coupled to the crystal and also employed as a bolometer (Fig. 29). Scintillation light due to heavy particles is strongly quenched, thus the measurement of the ratio of the emitted light over the energy dissipated into heat allows to discriminate between \u03b1 and \u03b2/\u03b3 events with the same energy. Very good results in this direction have already been obtained (see e. g. Refs. [130][131][132]), however this approach is limited to materials that exhibit scintillation properties. Therefore, the use of this techniques with TeO 2 crystals is frustrated by the low luminescence of paratellurite. 21 Nonetheless, it was shown in Ref. [135] that TeO 2 crystals have suitable optical properties to act as excellentCerenkov radiators, with the threshold fo\u0213 Cerenkov emission of about 50 keV for electrons and of about 400 MeV for \u03b1 particles. Therefore, as in the case of scintillation, no light emission is expected from the \u03b1 background, allowing for a full background rejection, in principle even by detecting one singleCerenkov photon. A total of about 125 photons (in the range (350\u2212600) nm) is expected for the two electrons emitted in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 process and a light yield of about 52Cerenkov photons per deposited MeV was actually measured in a CUORE-like crystal [136].",

Several technologies are under investigation in this direction and many R&D programs are in different stages of evolution [140]. Among these, very promising solutions foresee the use of microwave kinetic inductance detectors [141,142], transition edge sensors [143,144] or Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) amplified light detectors [124,[144][145][146][147][148]. In particular, the very recent results in Ref.

In fact, due to the intrinsic working principle, bolometers do not have a dead layer and are fully sensitive up to the surface. While this property is responsible for the excellent energy resolution and high detection efficiency, it represents a problem when surface events constitute a dominant component of the background, since the crystal surface is as sensitive as the bulk. In order to address this issue, the addition of passive elements on the bolometer surface has been proposed. The deposition of superconducting Al films should affect the shape of the events originating a few mm from the surface, thus one expects different signal shapes for surface and bulk events [149]. Alternatively, surface energy events could be identified thanks to an external plastic scintillator, by encapsulating the crystal with a scintillating foil and by adding a light detector to measure (in addition to theCerenkov light) the light emitted in the interaction of surface events with the foil itself [150].",

I A, when converting the experimental limit on the decay half-life time into a bound on the Majorana effective mass, it is necessary to pass through the theoretical calculations of nuclear physics, which up to date present quite large uncertainties. We opted to use a value of M 0\u03bd (refer to Eq. (7)) obtained by averaging the individual ones from Refs. [5,6,151], and to consider more possibilities for the value of the axial coupling constant, i. e. g A equal to g A,nucl , g A,quark or g A,phen , hoping that at some point the issue of the quenching will be sorted out. This choice is somehow different from the \"usual\" one, adopted by the experimental collaborations, of selecting multiple NME calculations and fixing g A (see also Sec. III E). However, it is a conservative approach that explores different potential scenarios. In fact, assuming less favorable values for g A is equivalent to require a higher sensitivity on m \u03b2\u03b2 with g A = g A,nucl , namely the case g A = g A,quark would corresponds to a goal of m \u03b2\u03b2 6 meV, while the case g A = g A,phen to m \u03b2\u03b2 2 meV, more or less at the center of the NH band for the lightest neutrino mass approaching zero.",

This advantage though decreases to \u223c 1.5 in the realistic comparison between TeO 2 and Li 2 MoO 4 /ZnMoO 4 [132], given that the most promising use of 100 Mo is with a bolometric experiment too. Instead, the situation seems less favorable for 76 Ge and 136 Xe approximately at the same level. As an additional consideration, quite borderline for a scientific discussion such as the current one, something can be said about the cost of the isotope, which will represent a large (if not the major) fraction of the whole experiment's cost. There is large room for speculation and it is possible that the situation will significantly change in the future. However, neglecting the procurement of the natural element and its purification, it is realistic to assume that the minimum cost for the enrichment in the isotope of interest will be represented by that for the extraction of 136 Xe, the easiest and least expensive isotope to separate since, being it in the gas form, it can directly undergo centrifugation. The current value amounts to 20 $ per gram of isotope [19]. 23 A similar cost can be assumed for 130 Te [26], while larger ones in a ratio 3 to TABLE IV.

The target is to probe m \u03b2\u03b2 = 10 meV, assuming small uncertainties on the NMEs, and three possible values for gA (see the text for details). The calculations are performed assuming experiments with 100% detection efficiency, no fiducial volume cuts and zero background with the required (B \u2022 \u2206) product to fulfill this condition.  130 Te. Anyway, it is important to stress again that, independent from any comparison, each experiment will be asked to prove its ability to achieve the corresponding half-life time sensitivity with zero background. Therefore, the amount of material and the background level required to 130 Te in the most optimistic scenario (g A = g A,nucl ) will be likely fulfilled by CUPID (see Sec. IV B 3), while in the case of g A = g A,quark a larger effort would be needed. Still, this could be seen as an open challenge. The third and most pessimistic scenario appears unaccessible to all experiments, but a larger understanding of nuclear physics on the theoretical side is needed in order to extract more quantitative information.",
