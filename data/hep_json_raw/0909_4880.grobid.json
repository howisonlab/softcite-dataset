            "text": "The measurement of CP violation in B meson decays provides crucial tests of the Standard Model (SM) and of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism [1]. CKM-suppressed b\u2192qq s (q = u, d, s) processes are dominated by a single loop (penguin) amplitude, that, assuming penguin dominance and neglecting higher order contributions, is expected to have the same phase \u03b2 of the CKM-favored b \u2192 ccs transition [2]. In many extensions of the SM new heavy particles may appear in the loop [3], giving rise to deviations from this expectation. These deviations are expected to be channel dependent. The measurement of the phase difference between B 0 \u2192K * (892) + \u03c0 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192K * (892) \u2212 \u03c0 + can be used to constrain the CKM parameters in the (\u03c1,\u03b7) plane [4].",
