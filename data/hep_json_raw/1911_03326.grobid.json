            "text": "Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb \u22121 , collected by the LHCb experiment, the production of the \u03b7 c (1S) state in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV is studied in the rapidity range 2.0 < y < 4.5 and in the transverse momentum range 6.5 < p T < 14.0 GeV. The cross-section for prompt production of \u03b7 c (1S) mesons relative to that of the J/\u03c8 meson is measured using the p p decay mode and is found to be \u03c3 \u03b7 c (1S) /\u03c3 J/\u03c8 = 1.69 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.18. The quoted uncertainties are, in order, statistical, systematic and due to uncertainties on the branching fractions of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 p p and \u03b7 c \u2192 p p decays. The prompt \u03b7 c (1S) production cross-section is determined to be \u03c3 \u03b7 c (1S) = 1.26 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5b, where the last uncertainty includes that on the J/\u03c8 meson cross-section. The ratio of the branching fractions of b-hadron decays to the \u03b7 c (1S) and J/\u03c8 states is measured to be B b\u2192\u03b7 c X /B b\u2192J/\u03c8 X = 0.48 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.05, where the last uncertainty is due to those on the branching fractions of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 p p and \u03b7 c \u2192 p p decays. The difference between the J/\u03c8 and \u03b7 c (1S) masses is also determined to be 113.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 MeV, which is the most precise single measurement of this quantity to date.",

For the \u03b7 c state, the signal shape is modelled by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function convolved with the sum of two Gaussian functions, while the signal shape of the J/\u03c8 state is modelled by the sum of two Gaussian functions. In the study of the \u03b7 c production, the mass values M J/\u03c8 and M J/\u03c8 , \u03b7 c are constrained within uncertainties in each p T bin to the values obtained from a fit to the entire data sample, where they are found to be consistent with the known values [37]. The mass resolutions of charmonium from b-hadron decays and from prompt production are assumed to be the same, as confirmed by simulation. The ratio between the widths of the resolution functions for the J/\u03c8 and \u03b7 c mesons is fixed from simulation. The only resolution parameter left free to vary in the fit is the width of the narrower Gaussian in the \u03b7 c model. A small p T -dependence of resolution parameters is seen in the simulation and is accounted for in the fit. The natural width of the \u03b7 c meson is fixed to its known value [37]. The combinatorial background is parametrised using an exponential multiplied by a second-order polynomial. A partially reconstructed background of protonantiproton pairs from the decays of higher mass charmonium states could exhibit structures in the p p invariant mass spectrum. The only contribution relevant for this analysis is that from J/\u03c8 \u2192 p p\u03c0 0 decays, where the \u03c0 0 meson is not reconstructed. This background produces a broad, non peaking, contribution to the p p invariant mass below the known \u03b7 c mass. In this region, the p p\u03c0 0 background is described by a square-root shape, M T \u2212 M p p , below the phase-space limit, M T .

Each uncertainty is estimated in p T bins as a difference between the baseline fit result and the alternative fit result. Generally, bin-to-bin variations of uncorrelated systematic uncertainties addressed in this paragraph are small compared to the statistical uncertainties. These variations are parametrised using a linear p T dependence to reduce statistical fluctuations. The uncertainty related to a potential p T dependence of the resolution ratio is evaluated by modelling it using a linear function with the slope constrained by simulation. This systematic effect is relevant for the differential cross-section measurement. The uncertainty corresponding to the combinatorial background description is estimated by using an alternative model using a third-order polynomial function.

The uncertainty on the \u03b7 c natural width is accounted for by the difference in relative yields when using the world average value of 31.9 \u00b1 0.7 MeV [37] and the value, 34.0 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 1.3 MeV, recently measured by LHCb collaboration [36]. Since this uncertainty is correlated among p T bins, the relative systematic uncertainty obtained from the p T -integrated data sample is taken as an estimate of the relative systematic uncertainty in each bin. This uncertainty is also correlated between p T bins. Possible nonzero polarisation of prompt J/\u03c8 mesons affects their reconstruction efficiency. The J/\u03c8 polarisation has not been measured at \u221a s =13 TeV, although several experiments have measured small polarisation values at lower energy [13,15,16]. The associated systematic uncertainty is estimated by weighting the prompt J/\u03c8 simulation sample assuming polarisation parameter values \u03bb \u03b8 = \u00b10.1 [52] in the p p collision frame. This uncertainty is correlated among p T bins.",

            "text": "In the alternative analysis discussed in this appendix, the p p invariant-mass fit is performed simultaneously in 28 two-dimensional bins of p T and t z with the model described in Sect. 4. This model is modified to correct for systematic mass shifts as a function of t z . The corrections are derived from simulation, where the same behaviour is observed. 4 The mass fits result in four t z distributions, each corresponding to a p T bin. Promptly produced charmonium is distinguished from that produced in b-hadron decays by performing a simultaneous \u03c7 2 fit to the four t z distributions. This fit method does not use the bin centre for the value of t z , but rather the average value of the fit function in the bin. The model to describe the t z distribution comprises contributions due to prompt charmonia, due to charmonia from b-hadron decays and a contribution due to candidates with a wrongly associated PV. The prompt charmonium component is parametrised with a function to account only for resolution, while the component related to charmonia produced in inclusive b-hadron decays is parametrised by an exponential decay function convolved with the same resolution function. The exponential slope of the decay function, \u03c4 b , is allowed to vary over p T according to simulation. The resolution is described by the sum of two Gaussian functions, with the width of the narrow Gaussian component a free fit parameter and the other parameters fixed from the simulation. The p T dependence of the resolution, as obtained from simulation, is taken into account in the t z -fit to data. The contribution due to candidates associated to a wrong PV are described in the same way as in Ref. [6]. Results of the simultaneous fit to t z for the entire p T range are shown in Fig. 7. In addition to the sources of systematic uncertainty discussed in Sect. 5 for the baseline analysis, contributions from the signal description in the fit to t z and from corrections of the invariant-mass peak positions in t z bins are considered. This approach is free from the systematic uncertainty associated with the cross-feed effect. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are the same as for the baseline analysis.",
