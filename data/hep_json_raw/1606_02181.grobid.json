The yield is measured to be \u22120.8 \u00b1 2.3 times the Standard Model cross-section for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.

            "text": "Since the ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported the observation [1,2] of a new particle with a mass of about 125 GeV and with properties consistent with those expected for the Higgs boson in the Standard Model (SM) [3][4][5], more precise measurements have strengthened the hypothesis that the new particle is indeed the Higgs boson [6][7][8][9]. These measurements were performed primarily in the bosonic decay modes of the new particle: H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W + W \u2212 . It is essential to study whether it also directly decays into fermions as predicted by the SM. Recently CMS and ATLAS reported evidence for the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode at a significance level of 3.4 and 4.5 standard deviations, respectively [10][11][12], and the combination of these results qualifies as an observation [13]. However, the H \u2192 bb decay mode has not yet been observed [14][15][16][17][18][19], and the only direct evidence of its existence so far has been obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations [14] at the Tevatron collider. The production processes of Higgs bosons at the LHC include gluon fusion (gg \u2192 H, denoted ggF), vector-boson fusion (qq \u2192 qqH, denoted VBF), Higgs-strahlung (qq \u2192 W H, ZH, denoted W H/ZH or jointly V H), and production in association with a topquark pair (gg \u2192 ttH, denoted ttH). While an inclusive observation of the SM Higgs boson decaying to a bb pair is difficult in hadron collisions because of the overwhelming background from multijet production, the V H, VBF, and ttH processes offer viable options for the observation of the bb decay channel. As reported in refs. [15][16][17][18][19], the leptonic decays of vector bosons, the kinematic properties of the production process, and the identification of top quarks are used to reduce the background for V H, VBF, and ttH, respectively. This article presents a search for VBF production of the SM Higgs boson in the bb decay mode (VBF signal or VBF Higgs hereafter) using data recorded with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV. The signal is searched for as a resonance in the invariant mass distribution (m bb ) of a pair of jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) in vector-boson-fusion candidates. Events are selected by requiring four energetic jets generated from the qqH \u2192 qqbb process as illustrated in figure 1: two lightquark jets (VBF jets) at a small angle with respect to the beam line and two b-jets from the Higgs boson decay in more central regions. Higgs bosons are colour singlets with no colour line to the bottom quarks; thus little QCD radiation and hadronic activity is expected between the two VBF jets, creating a rapidity gap between them. This feature is used to distinguish signal events from multijet events, which form the dominant background with a non-resonant contribution to the m bb distribution. Another relevant background source arises from the decay of a Z boson to bb in association with two jets (Z \u2192 bb or Z hereafter). This results in a resonant contribution to the m bb distribution.",

Limited MC sizes affect the normalisation via the acceptance of the signal events and the shape of the signal m bb distribution. Several sources contribute to the uncertainty on the jet energy scale [44]. They include the in situ jet calibration, pile-up-dependent corrections and the flavour composition of jets in different event classes. The shape of the m bb distribution for the Higgs signal and the Z background is affected by the jet energy scale uncertainty. Moreover, the change in the jet energy modifies the value of the BDT output and can cause migration of events between BDT categories. The b-jet trigger and tagging efficiencies are another source of systematic uncertainty, contributing 10% to the total uncertainty. They are calibrated using multijet events containing a muon and tt events, respectively [54]. The uncertainty on the jet energy resolution contributes about 4%. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity, 1.9% [55], is included, but is negligible compared to the other uncertainties mentioned above.",

The robustness of the fit is validated by generating pseudo-data and constructing pulls of the estimated number of Higgs events for various values of \u00b5. The fit results are presented in figure 7. The Higgs signal strength is measured to be \u00b5 = \u22125.2 \u00b1 3.7(stat.) +2.7 \u22122.5 (syst.), where the statistical uncertainty includes the statistical uncertainty on the non-resonant background modelling (see table 4). The sources of systematic uncertainty are the same as those for the MVA analysis as described in section 8 and are summarised in table 4. The uncertainties on \u00b5 are estimated as the changes in \u00b5 when the sources are varied within their uncertainties. Higher-order corrections to the Z samples and to the signal samples, the choice of function describing the non-resonant background, and the jet energy scale are the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty, each contributing about 40-50% to the total systematic uncertainty on the Higgs signal strength. The magnitudes of experimental and theoretical uncertianties are scaled with the central value of \u00b5, as illustrated in table 4 except for the case of the MC statistical uncertainty. This is due to the fact that the MVA divides the MC samples into four categories, and uses the signal m bb distribution directly in the fit as a template while the cut-based analysis uses an interpolated function. The upper limit on the strength is found to be 5.4 at the 95% CL, which can be compared to the expected limit values of 8.5 in the background-only hypothesis and 9.5 if Standard Model production is assumed. These results are consistent with those of the MVA. As expected, the cut-based analysis is less sensitive than the MVA.",

The dataset analysed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 from pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run 1 of the LHC. Events are selected using the distinct final state of the VBF H \u2192 bb signal, which is the presence of four energetic jets: two b-jets from the Higgs boson decay in the central region of the detector and two jets in the forward/backward region. To improve the sensitivity, a multivariate analysis is used, exploiting the topology of the VBF Higgs final state and the properties of jets. The signal yield is estimated by performing a fit to the invariant mass distribution of the two b-jets in the range 70 < m bb < 300 GeV and assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The ratio of the Higgs signal yield to the SM prediction is measured to be \u00b5 = \u22120.8 \u00b1 1.3(stat.) +1.8 \u22121.9 (syst.) = \u22120.8 \u00b1 2.3.

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .",
