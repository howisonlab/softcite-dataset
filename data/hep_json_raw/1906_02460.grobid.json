Therefore, the medium produced in such collisions is expected to be described through partonic degrees of freedom. Since at the scale of a phase transition to deconfinement QCD acts in a non-perturbative regime there are several limitations for theoretical computations, and experimental probes represent the only way to characterize many properties and the evolution of the medium. ALICE is one of the main four LHC experiments [1,2] and it was specifically conceived to study heavy-ion physics by providing a precise tracking and a powerful particle identification (PID) in a very high-multiplicity environment.",

Such a distance, which is different event-by-event, is the so-called impact parameter. In this respect, a first instance of the nuclear collision can be represented as an overlap of independent collisions of their constituents, the nucleons, and the number of their binary collisions relies on the size of the overlapping region. Therefore, depending on the impact parameter, collisions can be grouped in classes of centrality which represent the fraction, in percent, of minimum bias collisions. We usually refer to those with smallest impact parameter as centrality \u223c0%, and to the most peripheral events as \u223c100%. Since the magnitude of the impact parameter is between zero and the sum of the radii of two colliding nuclei, i.e., at the level of few fm, it cannot be directly measured, and then centralities are usually classified using the multiplicity of charged particles, the transverse energy at midrapidity, or the energy measured in the forward rapidity region. In the ALICE case, the centrality estimate relies on the amplitude of the V0-scintillator [3], whose signal distribution is fitted with a Glauber model [4]. In addition, the Glauber model allows associating to each centrality class the number of participating nucleons (N part ) and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N coll ), which are fundamental quantities to characterize the strength of the interaction.",

The strength of such correlations depends on the geometry of the emitting source and in particular on the radii along the three directions: R out , R side (the sizes in the transverse plane) and R long (the size along the longitudinal direction). The product of the three radii, reported in Figure 1, for different center-of-mass energies as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 , allows one to estimate the volume of the source. At the LHC energies, it is a factor 2 larger than the volume measured at RHIC (V \u223c 300 fm 3 ). Corresponding total duration of the longitudinal expansion and hence the lifetime of the system is at the LHC 20% longer than the one measured at RHIC [5]. ",

Already confirmed at AGS [12], SPS [13,14] and RHIC [15], it was observed also by ALICE [16]. The production of strange and multi-strange baryons was measured by ALICE for Pb-Pb, p-Pb and pp in different multiplicity classes ( Figure 4) [17]. The similar trend for different colliding systems is one of the most recent and intriguing results. Moreover, some thermal models are able to reproduce the observed plateau for multistrange-over-pion ratios, by assuming saturation at the grand canonical limit when the size of the system is large enough. Therefore, the lower value in the low-multiplicity region may indicate that for smaller colliding systems such a limit is still not reached. As shown, ALICE can also reconstruct short living resonances such as \u03c6 and K * 0 . The lifetimes of \u03c6 and K * 0 are very different, thus the comparison between them can shed some light on the interaction of the long lived particle with the medium. A suppression of the visible resonances due to daughter particle rescattering would be an indication of the effect of a high dense medium (a possible mitigation of the effect due to recombination has to be taken into account).  A clear suppression of K * 0 as a function of charge particle multiplicity [18] is visible in Figure 5 while the \u03c6 meson looks unaffected by that. This can be explained in terms of the lifetime of the two resonances, which are quite different (4.2 fm/c for K * 0 and 46.2 fm/c for \u03c6). Since the K * 0 can decay within the medium and its daughters may rescatter in a high-dense environment (high multiplicity events), a fraction of K * 0 is no longer visible. This does not occur in the \u03c6 case, which means that, in this interpretation, the lifetime of the medium should be in between the ones of the two resonances. ",

Since the response of a particle to the medium collective motion may depend on the particle properties (e.g., the mass), the measurements were performed separately for each identified particle [19]. At low transverse momenta, the \u03c6-meson elliptic flow is similar to the one of the proton, as show in Figure 7. This can be explained as a similar effect of radial flow on particles with similar mass, as already observed when considering the ratio of their yields (Figure 3). At intermediate transverse momenta (p T > 2.5 GeV/c), where the hydrodynamic description ceases to be applicable, other processes, such as quark recombination, may play a more important role. This is visible in the fact that particles v 2 s are grouped accordingly to the quark content (meson/baryon splitting). In particular, the \u03c6 meson follows other mesons above 3 GeV/c in conformity with the prediction of coalescence/recombination models.",

Such a method, which takes the QGP properties of interest as input parameters, is calibrated to fit the experimental data, thereby extracting a posterior probability distribution for the parameters, as shown in Figure 8.  The extension of v n measurements to pp and p-Pb is very interesting when looking for the existence of collective phenomena in small systems. To suppress non-flow effects (e.g., mini-jets), higher order multi-particle cumulants were measured. The common trend vs. charged multiplicity observed in Figure 9, independently of the system considered, is currently one of the strongest hints for collectivity in small systems. ",

Differently from pure electroweak probes, hadrons are strongly suppressed, as shown in Figure 10. Since the same effect is not visible in the R pPb , where parton distributions play the same role as in Pb-Pb, the overall picture is consistent with interaction of colored particles (partons) with a colored (deconfined) medium produced only in Pb-Pb. Moreover, similar features between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions were found, in terms of R AA , when comparing the two systems at the same multiplicity ( Figure 11) [28]. Some deviations in peripheral collisions can be due to the selection of different centralities when requiring the same average multiplicity. ",

The main approximation used in Equation (3) is in the assumption of a production probability independent of the volume of the source. Such an assumption cannot be valid if the size of the source at the freeze-out is much larger than the size of the nuclei. ALICE measured the B A parameter in different collision systems (e.g., [40]), (according to Equation (3)) and the results are reported in Figure 15 (right). The coalescence parameter decreases when multiplicity increases. Such an effect cannot be reproduced in the simple model presented (Equation (3)) since the volume of the emitting source (expected to increase with multiplicity) is neglected. In any case, the common trend with particle density, independently of the collision system, is a non-trivial result. ALICE also measured the hyper-nucleus 3 \u03bb H \u2192 3 He + \u03c0 \u2212 (and charge conjugated, branching ratio \u223c25%). In Figure 16 (left), the peak in the invariant mass distribution for the channel considered is reported. Moreover, ALICE measured the lifetime of this state by reconstructing the secondary vertex distribution. This ALICE measurement ( Figure 16, right) provides information on the baryon-baryon interactions in the strangeness sector and it is at present the most precise value for the hypernuclei lifetime.  and (Right) hypertriton lifetime.",

In particular, the major changes are related to the upgrades to faster detectors to allow ALICE to switch to a continuous readout mode [41]. Therefore, to improve the data acquisition rate, the time-projection chamber will be completely replaced with a GEM technology [42]. In parallel, the online and offline systems will be completely renewed [43] to allow us to manage the new features of the DAQ model. To improve during Run-3 and Run-4 the physics program related to charm and beauty probes [44], a Muon Forward Tracker [46] will be installed and the ITS detector will be replaced with a new one [45] with a higher capability for secondary vertex reconstruction and a much lower material budget. The lower material budget will allow also to extend the ALICE sensitivity at lower momenta, especially when running in a lower magnetic field configuration (B = 0.2T).",
