CUPID-Mo detectors feature background suppression using a dual-readout scheme with Li2MoO4 crystals complemented by Ge bolometers for light detection. The detection of both heat and scintillation light signals allows the efficient discrimination of \u03b1 from \u03b3&\u03b2 events. In this proceedings, we discuss results from the first 2 months of data taking in spring 2019. In addition to an excellent bolometric performance of 6.7 keV (FWHM) at 2615 keV and an \u03b1 separation of better than 99.9% for all detectors, we report on bulk radiopurity for Th and U. Finally, we interpret the accumulated physics data in terms of a limit of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 3\u00d710 23 yr for 100 Mo and discuss the sensitivity of CUPID-Mo until the expected end of physics data taking in early 2020.",

The theory predicts new lepton number violating processes and has been investigated for its possibilty of producing the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe through leptogenesis [2]. It also predicts that neutrinos can be their own antiparticles giving rise to the hypothetical decay process of neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2). In this decay the (anti-) neutrino is reabsorbed in the second vertex and only two electrons and the nucleus remain in the final state. Hence, the full decay energy can be easily detected [3].",

The detectors modules are arranged into 5 towers of 4 modules, where each module comprises a Li 2 100 MoO 4 crystal at the top and an adjacent thin Ge light detector below. This detector arrangement is housed inside of the low radioactivity infrastructure of the EDELWEISS-III experiment [14,15] in the underground laboratory of Modane (France). The setup and the detector performance were characterized in an initial commissioning campaign in March 2019 and have been described in detail in [12]. All detectors were found to be operational and only a single detector module with abnormal noise condition was discarded from the analysis. Of the remaining 19 detectors all achieved performances, compatible with better than 99.9 % \u03b1 separation at equally high \u03b3&\u03b2 acceptance. In the present analysis we use the same 19 detectors and present results from an extended period of data taking between April and June 2019, about 5 times longer than the comissioning. The data processing is based on the Diana processing tools developed by the CUORE and CUPID-0 collaborations [16,17]. ",

Using the most prominent lines from 208 Tl (2615 keV) and 214 Bi (609 keV, 1120 keV, 1764 keV) we fit a 2nd order polynomial through their respective mean positions and obtain the summed calibration spectrum, shown in Fig. 1. We perform a simultaneous unbinned extended maximum likelihood (UEML) fit across the 19 detectors with individual amplitudes and resolutions for the 208 Tl peak and extract a resolution of 6.7 keV FWHM (harm. mean) at 2615 keV. We further model the spectrum with a common step function that describes multi-Compton events in terms of the ratio of the continuum to the 208 Tl peak height and we include a common linear component to approximate 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 events and remaining background from pile-up. We use significant \u03b3-peaks of the summed calibration spectrum to obtain resolution estimates for various energies in order to extrapolate the energy resolution at 3034 keV ( 100 Mo Q \u03b2\u03b2 ). We evaluate both a linear fit as well as an extrapolation adding the resolution from a fixed noise component and a statistical term that scales with \u221a E in quadrature. In Fig. 2 the preferred fit is drawn, which predicts a resolution of (7.7 \u00b1 0.4) keV (FWHM) at Q \u03b2\u03b2 . ",

            "text": "Based on these first two months of physics data we can confirm the high degree of reproducibility and ease of operation of the detectors. Thanks to the very low background with a single event between 3 MeV and 4 MeV and no event close to Q \u03b2\u03b2 of 100 Mo at 3034 keV we can translate these first results into a limit on T 0\u03bd 1/2 using a one sided 90% Poisson confidence bound of 2.3 events. We fold in the systematic uncertainty from the efficiency evaluation following Cousins and Highland [18] and obtain a limit of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 3 \u00d7 10 23 yr (see Fig. 5).  We compare this result to our projected sensitivity calculated for a 5 keV energy resolution (FWHM), 75% 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 containment efficiency, a \u223c 90% analysis efficiency and for the background index of either 10 \u22122 counts/(keV\u00d7kg\u00d7yr) or 10 \u22123 counts/(keV\u00d7kg\u00d7yr). Since the present exposure is in the background free regime for both hypothesis, there is no impact of the slightly worse energy resolution and we fall within 10% of the expected exclusion limit. We note that this limit is a factor 4 worse than the leading limit of NEMO-3 for 100 Mo of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 1.1 \u00d7 10 24 yr [19], achieved after 5 years of data taking with \u223c7 instead of \u223c2 kg of 100 Mo. Based on these very encouraging results from a preliminary analysis we started working on the development of a detailed background model and to optimize the procedure for a blind 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 analysis with more than half a year (2 kg \u00d7 yr) of physics exposure in early 2020.",
