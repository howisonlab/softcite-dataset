            "text": "Precise predictions of the antineutrino spectra emitted by nuclear reactors is a key ingredient in measurements of reactor neutrino oscillations as well as of the recent applications to the surveillance of power plants in the context of non proliferation of nuclear weapons. We report new calculations including the latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all \u03b2-branches of all fission products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10 to 20% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of 238 U is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant isotopes 235 U and 239 Pu, we developed a more accurate approach combining information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated with the fission of 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu, measured at ILL in the 80's. We show how the anchor point of the measured total \u03b2-spectra can be used to suppress the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu isotopes in the 2-8 MeV range. While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to that of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3% on average. In the perspective of the re-analysis of past experiments and direct use of these results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of errors and their correlations as well as the corrections induced by off equilibrium effects.",

            "text": "Nuclear power plants are the most intense mancontrolled sources of neutrinos. With an average energy of about 200 MeV released per fission and 6 neutrinos produced along the \u03b2-decay chain of the fission products, one expects some 2 \u00d7 10 20 \u03bd/s emitted in a 4\u03c0 solid angle from a 1 GW reactor (thermal power). Since unstable fission products are neutron-rich nuclei all \u03b2-decays are of \u03b2 \u2212 type and the neutrino flux is actually pure electronic antineutrinos (\u03bd e ). These unique features have been exploited by several neutrino oscillations experiments [1,2]. Improvement in the accuracy of\u03bd e spectra is motivated by next generation experiments [3][4][5] aiming at unprecedented sensitivity to the last unknown mixing angle \u03b8 13 . The value of this parameter may determine the future trend of the neutrino physics, in particular for the search of CP violation in the lepton sector. Recent developments of compact (1 m 3 target scale)\u03bd e detectors as new safeguard tools for the monitoring of reactors [6][7][8] would also benefit from an accurate description of\u03bd e spectra.",

            "text": "In a reactor core, only 1 neutron among the few generated by the fission of a 235 U nucleus should induce another fission, so that the core never reaches the overcritical regime. A fraction of the neutrons is actually captured by the dominant 238 U isotope leading to the production of new fissile isotopes: 239 Pu and to a lesser extent 241 Pu. When operating, a core is thus burning 235 U and accumulating 239 Pu. This is the so-called burnup process. In a pressurized water reactor, fission rates from both isotopes become comparable at the end of a cycle. The remaining fissions of 241 Pu and fast neutron induced fissions of 238 U share about 10% of the reactor power. As a result, the accurate prediction of the\u03bd e spectrum of a reactor requires following the time evolution of these four isotopes, as well as the knowledge of the associated \u03b2-spectra of their neutron-rich fission products.",

This work was triggered by the current effort of precision measurement of reactor neutrinos in the Double Chooz collaboration [3]. Our approach combines the assets of the two main methods used so far. The first method is the so-called \"ab initio approach\" where the\u03bd e spectrum associated with one of the 4 fissioning isotopes is computed as the sum of the contributions from all fission products. This requires a huge amount of information on the thousands of \u03b2-branches involved and the weighting factors of fission products, the fission yields. Section II presents details on the ingredients of the ab initio approach while section III gives an update of ab initio calculations combining all data available today. The main systematic er-rors are discussed and a prediction of 238 U spectra is given since this isotope is the only one with no integral beta spectrum measured yet.",

The estimation of the error associated to theoretical predictions remains a difficult task and in practice they are supplanted by measurements performed in the 80's at the ILL High Flux Reactor in Grenoble [9][10][11][12].

The total spectrum S k (E) of each fissioning isotope is built up according to the equations of section II, retrieving the information on all \u03b2-branches from the ENSDF nuclear database [25]. The motivations for such an approach are that when all parameters of a \u03b2-branch are known the neutrino branch is also known in a modelindependent way and all errors on the input parameters can in principle be propagated. We have developed an interface with the ENSDF data library to read the relevant parameters of Eqs. (3) and (4) and their experimental error. The forbiddenness of a \u03b2-transition is deduced from the spin and parity of the connected nuclear levels. In cases when this information is missing or uncomplete, the lowest possible forbiddenness is chosen by default. All transitions tagged as forbidden are then forced to be of unique type and the corresponding expressions of the shape factors C b f p (E) are polynomials in the electron and antineutrino momenta taken from [26]. Using our homemade code BESTIOLE, all the above approximations used for the calculation of each branch are tagged and various scenarios can be tested to estimate the error envelope of the final predicted spectrum. From Eqs. (3) and (4) the electron and antineutrino spectra of each fission product are computed and stored in a database.",

These activities are determined using a simulation package called MCNP Utility for Reactor Evolution (MURE [27]). MURE is a precision code written in C++ which automates the preparation and computation of successive MCNP (Monte-Carlo N-Particle transport code [28]) calculations either for precision burn-up or thermal-hydraulics purpose. It is opensource, portable, and available at NEA [29] and constitutes an efficient tool for non-proliferation and thermal power scenario studies (for more details see [30] The detection process, common to many reactor antineutrino experiments, is the \u03b2-inverse reaction on a free proton\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n (10) which sets an energy threshold for the antineutrino of 1.804 MeV, the mass difference between the initial and final states (see figure 1). Therefore the lowest energy part of the \u03b2 spectra, below this threshold, is not addressed here. In this region, equilibrium is reached only after several months, requiring the control of significant transient effects when considering shorter irradiation times. Extra effects like the low energy \u03b2-decays induced by neutron capture on 238 U and fission products [31] would also have to be treated. On the high energy side, antineutrino rates above 8 MeV become negligible (< 0.5% of total detected rate). This part of the spectrum is dominated by the very energetic (high Q \u03b2 ) transitions of rare exotic nuclei and cannot be accurately predicted. Thus the intermediate energy range resulting from the observation of the detected spectrum in figure 1 turns out to be favorable to the control of the systematic errors of the predictions of reactor antineutrino spectra. A powerful test of our calculations is the comparison with the reference electron spectra from ILL [10][11][12]. Such a consistency check gives valuable insight into the distribution of the numerous \u03b2-branches, pointing to the main source of errors in the determination of the antineutrino spectra. Considering all the data available in the ENSDF data library, the predicted \u03b2-spectra associated with the fission of 235 U and 239 Pu are compared with the reference ILL data in figure 2.",

It reveals a \u00b1 10% oscillation pattern of the calculations around the data up to 7.5 MeV and a large overestimation at higher energy. This overestimation points to the well known systematic effect of pandemonium [32]. Indeed branching ratios and endpoints are usually determined by measuring the intensity and energy of \u03b3radiations emitted subsequently to the \u03b2 transition using high resolution but low efficiency Ge crystals. In the case of large Q \u03b2 a fraction of the beta branches connects the parent nucleus to very excited levels of the daughter nucleus. The strength of the associated low energy \u03b2-rays is either spread over multiple weak \u03b3-rays or concentrated in one high energy gamma ray. In both cases part or all the \u03b3-cascade can be missed by the measurement apparatus. As a result low endpoint transitions are often missed and high endpoints are given too much weight in the global decay scheme of the parent nucleus.",

[33] in the late eighties at the on-line isotopes separators ISOLDE, at CERN, Geneva, and OSIRIS at the Neutron Research Laboratory, Studsvik. Some 111 fission products, selected as the main contributors to the high energy part of reactor beta spectra (90% above 6 MeV) were measured. Electron spectra were recorded independently from the emitted gamma rays. This prevented sensitivity to the pandemonium effect but at the same time part of the information on single \u03b2-branches was lost. Among the 111 measured electron spectra, 44 were found in perfect agreement with the spectra predicted from the ENSDF database. The remaining 67 were then replaced in our database.",

The principle here is to implant the radioactive isotope on a foil surrounded by high efficiency gamma detectors able to collect the whole \u03b3-cascade following the beta-decay. The distribution of total \u03b3 energies gives access to the beta-strength of the studied isotope at the cost of a deconvolution analysis taking into account the full response of the apparatus. Eventually a complete betadecay scheme can be determined providing the relevant beta-branch information for electron and antineutrino spectra. Thus the 29 nuclei of R. Greenwood et al. [34] measured at the INEL facility, Idaho, were incorporated in our database. A. Algora and J. L. Tain studied carefully both Tengblad et al. and Greenwood et al.'s measurements [35]. Both may be affected by several sources of systematic effects which are difficult to quantify. In particular both measurements of 91 Rb beta decay mean energy differ by more than 350 keV, while the 91 Rb decay scheme was used in Tengblad et al.'s analysis to quantify the \u03b3-ray detector absolute efficiency. If the 91 Rb decay scheme is affected by the pandemonium effect, Tengblad et al.'s data sets may exhibit an overall systematic effect. A new TAGS measurement of the decay properties of 91 Rb has recently been performed at the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University facility [36], and will help addressing the uncertainties associated to both sets of measurements. In cases when a fission product was present in both data sets (8 nuclei only), giving the priority to Greenwood et al.'s or Tengblad et al's measurements changes the predicted spectrum by 3% at most in the 4-5 MeV range, the effect drops at the 1% level or below elsewhere. In the following priority is arbitrarily given to Tengblad et al's data. The dashed line in figure 3 shows the electron residues after merging our ENSDF based database with the above selected spectra supposedly corrected for the pandemonium effect. As expected the high energy part of our prediction has been significantly reduced leading to negative residues of increasing amplitude with energy. This indicates that a large part of the pandemonium effect is probably corrected and that contributions from the missing unknown transitions of exotic nuclei grow rapidly with energy.",

These predictions are based on the \"Gross Theory of Beta Decay\" [38] and were included in the JENDL database to supplement ENSDF data showing incomplete level schemes or for nuclei for which no data were available. The estimated spectra were stored in the JENDL file so as to keep the consistency between the average decay energy value derived from the spectrum and that used for decay heat analysis [39]. The calculated spectra were also compared with the directly measured spectra from the reference [33] and revealed to be in very good agreement. The total contribution of the JENDL electron spectra, not already included in the ENSDF and pandemonium corrected data, was computed and converted to its associated total antineutrino spectrum following the procedure described in [11]. Finally the few remaining nuclei were described using a model based on fits of the distributions of the end-points and branching ratios in the ENSDF database, then extrapolated to the exotic nuclei. The result is the solid curve in figure 3 showing flattened residues within a global envelope of \u00b1 10% over the whole energy range. This best agreement with the ILL reference data is actually valid for the 239 Pu isotope. Depending on the considered fissionning isotope, this new compilation of \u03b2-decay data includes about 845 nuclei and 10000 \u03b2-branches, about 525 nuclei come from the ENSDF and pandemonium corrected data, 285 from the JENDL database and 35 from our model.

Still, the relatively large energy range of detected antineutrino involves a sizeable contribution of unstable and poorly known nuclei in the total spectrum. Under these conditions, improving errors or even reaching the accuracy of the ILL reference spectra seems to require another fair amount of experimental effort. For applications like the determination of reactors decay heat calculations, a short list of \"pandemonium candidates\" to be remeasured with total absorption techniques has been identified [40]. Completion of a corrected beta-decay database is in progress (see for instance [41]) with more and more refined analyses [42]. Thanks to our database of fission product spectra, we have established a list of nuclei, contributing importantly to different energy bins of the antineutrino energy spectra from 235 U and 239 Pu, and that could be affected by the pandemonium effect. It will be the subject of a forthcoming publication. From this list we have selected a few nuclei which are amenable to experimental investigation using the TAGS technique, which can provide the beta intensity distribution in the full decay window eliminating the pandemonium effect. It appeared that some fission products being part of the measurement priority list selected for reactor decay heat assessment [41], also belong to the list of important contributors to the antineutrino emission in the energy window of interest for neutrino oscillation studies. Recent and on-going experimental efforts carried out in the field of reactor physics, neutrino physics but also of interest for nuclear structure and astrophysics will certainly allow to reduce the uncertainties associated to the reactor antineutrino spectra computed through the ab-initio method in the very next years [36,43,44]. We describe below the estimated error budget of our ab initio calculations and give a prediction of electron and antineutrino spectra of 238 U. In the perspective of neutrino oscillation analyses the 235 U and 239 Pu isotopes, which contribute to about 90% of a nuclear reactor spectrum, are predicted using a more accurate method presented in section IV.",

All sources of error are treated as independent and the total error matrix of rates in energy bins is computed. In the simpler case of a spectrum at equilibrium, the activity of each fission product is approximated by the associated cumulative fission yield indexed in the JEFF3.1.1 database [45]. Then the uncertainty on branching ratios and fission yields can be propagated analytically while the uncertainty on endpoints is propagated numerically (it turns out to have a negligible contribution). The dominant contribution of normalization errors induces large correlations between proximate bins as illustrated in table I. Note that these correlations are valid only for the specific part of the The second column of table II lists the global effect of the errors quoted in ENSDF at the 1 sigma level. It rises from 1 to 10 % in the 2-8 MeV range. Columns 3 and 4 show the impact of the theoretical assumptions used to describe the shape of the \u03b2-branches. Previous works always treated all branches as allowed. Comparing this hypothesis with our full treatment of forbiddenness shows changes of the final antineutrino spectrum below the 1% level (except for few bins around 4 MeV), validating the allowed approximation. The error associated with the finite size corrections A C and A W has been estimated by comparing the final spectra computed with no correction and those with the corrections from Vogel [15] or Holstein [17]. The missing information on exotic nuclei and the correction of the pandemonium effect unfortunately remain the dominant contribution in the final error of the ab initio approach. It is roughly estimated in the last column of the table based on the envelope of the various scenarios we tried and on the residues with respect to the reference ILL data. ",

Nevertheless we keep in mind that the beta-transitions described in nuclear databases represent about 90% of the total spectrum as measured at ILL. These physical distributions of end-points and nuclear charges are precious information to control the conversion between electron and antineutrino spectra. We describe below how this can be combined to the very precise ILL electron data for an improved prediction of antineutrino spectra.",

Thin target foils of fissile isotopes 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu were exposed to the thermal neutron flux 80 centimeters away from the center of the compact fuel assembly. A tiny part of the emitted electrons could exit the reactor core through a straight vacuum pipe to be detected by the high resolution magnetic spectrometer BILL [13]. The electron rates were recorded by a point wise measurement of the spectrum in magnetic field steps of 50 keV, providing an excellent determination of the shape of the electron spectrum with sub-percent systematic error. The published data are smoothed over 250 keV. Except for the highest energy bins with poor statistics, the dominant error was the absolute normalization, quoted around 3% (90% CL) with weak energy dependence. Note also that the ILL spectra are taken after typically 1 day of irradiation, meaning that the longest lived beta emitters (lowest energy beta rays) haven't reached equilibrium yet. These aspects are discussed in detail in section V B. The neutrino spectra, not directly detected, were deduced from those of the electron via a conversion procedure which induced some extra systematic effects. In [9][10][11][12] the authors considered 30 virtual beta branches. The procedure consisted in dividing the electron spectrum into 30 slices. Starting with the highest energy slice, the few data points in this slice were used to fit the endpoint and branching ratio of the first virtual branch. The full contribution of this virtual branch (from endpoint down to zero energy) was then subtracted from the experimental spectrum and the procedure repeated for the next, lower energy, slice. Then the antineutrino spectrum was simply the sum of all fitted virtual branches, converted to antineutrino branches by replacing E e by E \u03bd = E 0 \u2212 E e and applying the correct radiative corrections. This procedure was repeated several times, describing the spectrum with somewhat different sets of end point energies. Possible steps in the shape induced by the relatively small number of virtual branches were smoothed out by taking the average of all spectra and merging the 50 keV bins into the 250 keV presented in the publications. The theoretical expression of a virtual branch was the same as Eq.(4), except for the A C and A W corrections which were treated at the very end as an effective linear correction to the final antineutrino spectra",

In a recent paper [46], P. Vogel pointed out the main limitations of this conversion procedure. Despite the discontinuity of the Fermi function at the endpoint energy of an antineutrino branch, the \"true\" antineutrino spectrum from fission fragment appears continuous because thousands of branches contributes with a quasi-continuous endpoint distribution. When describing the spectrum by only 30 virtual branches a spurious oscillation with respect to the true spectrum appears around each virtual endpoint energy. Therefore smoothing out these oscillations requires sufficiently narrow slices of electron data and antineutrino energy bins several times larger than the slice width. All these criteria couldn't be fulfilled for the electron data taken at ILL and the estimation of the remaining effects is part of the quoted error bar. The other criterion highlighted by P. Vogel was the knowledge of the average nuclear charge < Z > of the virtual branches as a function of their endpoint energy. This information turns out to be of crucial importance for the shape of the high energy part of the antineutrino spectrum.",

It consists in starting with our ab initio prediction of section III and restrict the use of effective branches to fit only the missing few percent contribution of the difference with the reference ILL electron data. This way we keep the distributions of beta branches very close to the physical one and we can apply A C and A W corrections at the branch level. The reference ILL electron data are still fitted but the contribution of unphysical virtual branches is reduced by an order of magnitude. We use all available data in ENSDF plus the above-mentioned 67 nuclei from the \"pandemonium corrected\" measurements. In the case of the data from reference [33] only the total \u03b2 spectra of each nuclide are available, not the complete decay scheme as would be best. Hence, to be converted to a neutrino spectrum, each \u03b2 spectrum measured must be fitted by a set of branches. These branches differ from the virtual branches used to fit the ILL data by the fact that in this work the nuclear charge is perfectly known. Moreover the validation of the spectrum shape at the level of one nucleus provides a more refined description of the \u03b2-decay scheme equivalent to a small slice size in the total spectrum, pinning down the sources of errors discussed in [46].",

They are small, typically at the level of the statistical error of the ILL data, except in the 4.5-6.0 MeV range where one can see an oscillation pattern with an amplitude reaching three times the error of the ILL data at maximum. This may point to a systematic effect due to a failure of the fit model. We checked that using more effective branches is not efficient because of the limited number of experimental points available.

This shift of the emitted antineutrino flux is modulated at higher energy by oscillations which look like images of the oscillations in the electron residues.

We generated electron and antineutrino spectra as the sum of the spectra of all fission products indexed in ENSDF, weighted by the activity predicted by the MURE code after 12 hours of irradiation. We know from section III that these spectra are close to the ones measured at ILL and in the context of this test we call them \"true\" spectra in the sense that they are unambiguously connected to each other by the conversion of each single branch of the sum. Then we followed the exact same procedure as the one described in [10][11][12] to convert our \"true\" electron spectrum into an antineutrino spectrum. This includes using 30 virtual branches and the same effective Z distribution and the same effective A C + A W correction (Eq.(11)). The spectrum converted in this fashion is finally compared to our \"true\" antineutrino spectrum. Figure 7 shows that despite a very good fit quality of the electron spectrum (all electron residues are within a few 10 \u22123 from 1 to 8 MeV) the converted antineutrino spectrum exhibits residues with oscillations of few percent amplitude around the endpoint of each fitted branch. As expected, rebinning smoothes out these oscillations (solid curve) but a residual \u2243 +3% offset is clearly visible across the whole energy range. This curve can be directly compared to the result of our conversion of the ILL data, in figure 6(b).

            "text": "Switching on and off the various ingredients of the ILL conversion reveals a twofold origin of the normalization shift. At low energy, the deviation is mainly due to the treatment of the A C and A W correction terms. In Eq.(6) these two terms appear multiplied by the energy hence one would expect their net contribution to grow with energy. Nevertheless A C itself has some hidden energy dependence via the Z distribution of all branches (Eq.8) while the estimate of A W is a constant (Eq.9). To illustrate the size of the total correction A C + A W we show the ratio of corrected over non-corrected spectra in figure 8 in the case of total spectra build up from all ENSDF branches. There is a linear trend at high energy but direct comparison with the effective linear correction used in previous analysis Eq. (11) shouldn't be made at this stage. In fact in the conversion procedure the electron spectrum is fitted on the electron ILL data. By definition the fitting procedure optimizes the parameters of the few virtual electron branches used in this work so that the total electron spectrum always matches the ILL data, whatever the correction terms included in the theoretical expression of the branches. Therefore in the conversion process only the neutrino spectrum is sensitive to the A C kinetic energy (MeV) \u03bd and A W terms. The final effect is not intuitive but can be computed numerically as shown in figure 9. When applied at the branch level the A C and A W corrections deviate from the effective formula of Eq.(11) and explain the predicted 3% shift in the low energy region. We stress that no improvement was brought to the theoretical expression of the corrections (Eq. 8 and 9), only the way of implementing these corrections has been revisited avoiding the extra approximation of the effective correction of Eq. (11). While justified at high energy, we show that this approximation was giving too much amplitude to the correction at low energy. The effect is large enough to explain the observed 3% shift at low energy. At higher energy the dominant source of the shift comes from the parameterization of the charge distribution associated with the virtual \u03b2-branches. Figure 10 illustrates how large errors can be induced by the too rough approximation of a constant nuclear charge. In the ILL data analysis the mean charge of each virtual branch was taken from a polynomial fit Z(E 0 ) of the tabulated nuclear data (Eq (3) of [10]). This greatly reduced the bias but still this approach doesn't take into account the very large dispersion of nuclear charges around this mean. Even a new Z(E 0 ) function, fitted on the same data used to build our \"true\" spectrum generates a deviation of a few percent at high energy.",

One can see that the variations induced in the antineutrino spectra are negligible (\u2264 1%). This can be understood by the fact that although the different sets of fission yields do change the shape of the ab initio spectrum by a few percent, this change is absorbed by the virtual branches fitting the missing contribution with respect to the ILL electron spectrum.

As already observed in figure 6, any large residues pattern in the electron fit shows up in the antineutrino residues, slightly shifted in kinetic energy and amplified  by a factor of about 3. This behavior is used to estimate our error budget, summarized in table IV. Even in the case of zero residues, we count the statistical error of the reference \u03b2 spectrum as the minimum error of the converted antineutrino spectrum (column 4). Based on our numerous tests of fitting methods, the amplified envelope of non statistical electron residues is added in quadrature as an extra conversion error (column 5).",

In this reference, the departure from the antineutrino ILL spectra were computed using the cumulative yields of some known long-lived fission fragments. The results are shown as markers in figure 13 to be compared with the histograms of our calculations. The overall agreement is good, even when evolving the spectrum back to irradiation time as short as 10 4 s, where the corrections become quite large and have steep variations in time. Note that our reference spectrum at equilibrium does not use cumulative yields. Instead it is computed by our evolution code using independent fission yields and a long irradiation time. In the analysis of cumulative yields it is in fact assumed that all nuclei have reached equilibrium. This is fully justified for short lived fission products, whereas there is some ambiguity with the decay products of longest half-lives. To avoid apparent double counting of the cumulative yields of the daughters, some very long-lived decays have been removed from the cumulative yield databases but some are still present in the libraries. Because of these problems, it is recommended by nuclear databases [53] as a safer method to use independent yields with an inventory code.

From this work we gave a prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of 238 U with estimated relative uncertainty increasing from 10 to 20% with energy in the 2-8 MeV range. Since this isotope contributes to about 10% of the total fission rate of a reactor such a prediction is valuable. However, for the dominant isotopes, the remaining systematic errors of nuclear databases as well as the contribution of poorly known beta transitions still prevent the ab initio approach from any use for high precision neutrino oscillation experiments at reactors. This motivated the development of a new mixedapproach combining the accurate reference of the ILL electron spectra with the physical distribution of beta branches provided by the nuclear databases. We presented how this method gets rid of the main systematic error of the ab initio approach allowing a better control of the conversion of reference electron spectra into antineutrino spectra. While the final error budget ended up being comparable to previous reference work [10][11][12], we demonstrated that the antineutrino spectra emitted by the fission of 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu isotopes have to be corrected for a systematic shift of about 3% in normalization. This net effect was presented as the combination of an improved implementation of finite size corrections to the Fermi theory plus a more realistic description of the distribution of \u03b2-branches.",
