            "text": "The X(3872) is a charmonium(-like) state which was first observed in its decay X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in B decays [1]  [2] and inclusive production in pp collisions [3]  [4]. Meanwhile more decays such as final states D 0 D 0 * or J/\u03c8\u03c9 have been found. In particular, the observation of its radiative decay into J/\u03c8\u03b3 allows the assignment of positive charge parity C=+1. The interesting observation of isospin violation in the decay X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c1(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) raised the question, if it might be a charmonium state at all. As its mass is within \u2206m<1 MeV of the D 0 D 0 * threshold, it might be interpreted as an S-wave molecular state [6]  [7]. Many properties of the X(3872) are being studied at ongoing experiments. However, the width is unknown and probably can only be determined at PANDA. The current upper limit is \u0393<2.3 MeV [1], whereas PANDA might be able to set an upper limit in the order of a few hundred keV. The quantitative investigation of this upper limit on the width by detailed Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations incl. background is topic of this paper.",

In e + e \u2212 collisions, only states with quantum numbers J PC =1 \u2212\u2212 can be produced directly due to the intermediate virtual photon. As the X(3872) has positive C parity, thus, it can not be produced directly in e + e \u2212 . However, in pp collisions two or three gluons are produced in the annihilation, and states with any quantum number can be formed. At the PANDA interaction region, three different types of targets are foreseen, namely (a) hydrogen pellets with a thickness of 25 \u00b5m and a falling velocity of \u226560 m/s, (b) a cluster jet target and (c) fixed nuclear targets such as Be, C, Si or Al. For the pellet target, a peak luminosity of L =2\u00d710 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is expected. If adjusted to a single resonance, such as e.g. the J/\u03c8 this would correspond to about 2\u00d710 9 produced J/\u03c8 per year. A resonance scan with the cooled beam could provide a measurement of the X(3872) width. This technique was pioneered by the Fermilab experiments E760 and E835. With a beam momentum resolution of \u2206p/p=2\u202210 \u22124 , arXiv:1010.2350v2 [hep-ex] 23 Nov 2010 corresponding to a \u221a s resolution of 0.5 MeV (FWHM), the measurement of the width of the J/\u03c8 with \u0393(J/\u03c8)=99\u00b112(stat.)\u00b16(syst.) keV and the width of the \u03c8 with \u0393(\u03c8 )=306\u00b136(stat.)\u00b116(syst.) keV could be performed [9]. The requirements for the PANDA experiment are quite high: capability for high rate detection and data acquisition for \u22642\u00d710 7 interactions/s, 4\u03c0 solid angle coverage (incl. a high resolution forward detector, as PANDA is a fixed target experiment), secondary vertex detection of e.g. D mesons with a resolution \u03c3 <100 \u00b5m, charged track momentum resolution \u2206p/p 1%, charged particle identification for e \u00b1 , \u00b5 \u00b1 , \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p \u00b1 using e.g. Cherenkov detectors with internal reflection, and electromagnetic calorimetry in the range 10 MeV<E \u03b3 <5 GeV. Details about the experiment can be found elsewhere [10]. For the down below results, MC simulations were performed with all PANDA subdetectors implemented, but the reconstruction used only the following PANDA subdetectors:",

            "text": "\u2022 The fitted width of the excitation function is 20% larger than the width which was used as input in the MC simulation, due to the analysis technique such as the background subtraction and the reconstruction technique (e.g. the track fitter). Note, that the beam resolution is not the limit for the width measurement. Even with a beam momentum resolution of \u2206p beam 0.5 MeV, the E760 experiment was able to determine the factor of 5 smaller width of the J/\u03c8 [9]. The difference between generated and reconstructed width would only be a systematic error on the width measurement. \u2022 The width of the excitation function is still \u2264100 keV, if the assumed resolution of the anti-proton beam is \u2206p/p=2\u202210 \u22125 (HESR high resolution mode). However, in this analysis all distributions were assumed to have a Gaussian shape, while the correct resonance shape would be given by a Breit-Wigner parametrisation and the shape of the function G(E) in Eq. 2 might be non-Gaussian. In addition, for our analysis, we approximated the function \u221a s= 2m 2 p + 2m p p 2 beam + m 2 p by a linear function in the small range of the resonance region. As long as the beam resolution is accurately known, our results indicate that the width of the X(3872) could be determined at PANDA, if it is larger than \u0393 R \u2265100 keV and if the DPM generator describes the background shape correctly.",
