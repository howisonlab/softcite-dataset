            "text": "Measurement of the relative production of scalar mesons in B 0 and B 0 s meson decays can help to address this issue [3,4]. Measurements of B 0 (s) \u2192 J/\u03c8 f decays, where f represents either the f 0 (500) (also known as \u03c3) or the f 0 (980) meson, and f \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [5][6][7][8] have already provided important insight into the structure of the scalar mesons [9,10]. Studies of B 0 (s) \u2192 D 0 f decays provide complementary information to the B 0 (s) \u2192 J/\u03c8 f case [11]. Measurements of the branching fractions of B 0 \u2192 D 0 f 0 (500) and B 0 \u2192 D 0 f 0 (980) decays have been obtained from Dalitz plot analyses of B 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [12,13], but there is no experimental result to date on the B 0 s decays. In addition, under the assumption that the f 0 (980) meson has a predominant ss component, the B 0 s \u2192 D 0 f 0 (980) decay mode can be used to determine the angle \u03b3 of the CKM unitarity triangle [14,15], using the same methods that are applicable for the B 0 s \u2192 D 0 \u03c6 decay mode [16][17][18][19][20]. Since the B 0 s \u2192 D 0 \u03c6 decay has recently been observed [21], a signal for the B 0 s \u2192 D 0 f 0 (980) channel is expected if the branching fractions of the two decays are comparable. An explicit calculation predicts B B 0 s \u2192 D 0 f 0 (980) = 3.50 +1.26 \u22121.15",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished JHEP08(2015)005 using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [31].
