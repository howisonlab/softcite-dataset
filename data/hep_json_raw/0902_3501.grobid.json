[1], direct hadronic, electromagnetic and radiative decays are estimated to account for 69.2%, 13.4%, and 4.3%, respectively, of all J/\u03c8 decays. However, individual exclusive J/\u03c8 decays are more difficult to analyze quantitatively in QCD. To date, two-body decay modes such as J/\u03c8 \u2192 B 8B8 or P 9 V 9 , where B 8 , P 9 and V 9 refer to baryon octet, pseudoscalar nonet, and vector nonet particle, respectively, have been studied with some success using an effective model, and other similar methods [2].",

            "text": "Studies of three-body decays of J/\u03c8 are a natural extension of studies of two-body decays. Since most J/\u03c8 decays proceed via two-body intermediate states, including wide resonances, it is hard to experimentally extract the non-resonant three-body contribution [3]. Specific models based on proton and N * pole diagrams have been introduced to deal with these problems [2]. In the calculation, the soft-pion theorem [4] has been applied to the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 successfully. This method has also been used for J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03b7 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03b7 \u2032 decays [2]. This paper reports measurement of the branching fractions for pp\u03b7 and pp\u03b7 \u2032 , and tests of the soft-pion theorem for J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03b7, which states [2]: \u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03b7) \u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp) \u2243 0.64 \u00b1 0.52.",
