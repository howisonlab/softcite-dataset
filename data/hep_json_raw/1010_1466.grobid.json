Such large mixing with no introduction of anomalous couplings allows for single production of vector-like quarks at hadron colliders via the weak interaction [4].

We consider a model [4] in which there are two doublets of vector-like quarks that couple to the first generation of SM quarks. Vector-like quark final states are characterized by either a W or Z boson and at least two jets, one of which results from the decay of the vector-like quark, while another is produced in association with the vector-like quark at the primary vertex. We select events in which the vector boson decays to either electron(s) or muon(s). The D0 detector is described in detail in [8]. The region of the D0 detector closest to the interaction point contains a central-tracking system consisting of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) and a central fiber tracker (CFT), both of which are located within a 2 T superconducting solenoidal magnet. Hits in these two detectors are used to reconstruct tracks from charged particles. Surrounding the two tracking subdetectors are liquid-argon and uranium calorimeters, both electromagnetic and hadronic, which have a central section (CC) covering pseudorapidities [9] |\u03b7| 1.1, and two end calorimeters (EC) that extend coverage to |\u03b7| \u2248 4.2, with all three housed in separate cryostats. Electrons are identified as isolated energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter, with a shape consistent with that of an electron, matched to a track in the inner detector. Jets are reconstructed in the calorimeters using the iterative midpoint cone algo-rithm [10] with a cone of radius R = 0.5 in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space. An outer muon system, providing coverage for |\u03b7| < 2, consists of a layer of tracking detectors and scintillation trigger counters in front of 1.8 T toroids, followed by two similar layers after the toroids. Muons are identified via a combination of reconstructed tracks in both the outer muon system and the central tracking system, and are required to be isolated from both tracker and calorimeter activity.",

Signal samples are generated using madgraph [11], with CTEQ6L1 [12] parton distribution functions, LO cross sections from [4] and vector-like quark resonance widths calculated with bridge [13]. Subsequent parton shower evolution is generated with pythia [14]. We generate up-and down-type vector-like quark signals with masses between 280 GeV and 700 GeV. Backgrounds from tt, W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd+jets, and Z \u2192 \u2113\u2113+jets production are modeled using alpgen [15], also interfaced to pythia. For these events, we use a matching procedure to avoid double counting partons produced by alpgen and those added by the showering in pythia [16]. Diboson samples are generated with pythia, and single top quark production is modeled using the comphep [17] generator. All MC samples are passed through a geant [18] simulation of the D0 detector and are overlaid with data events from randomly chosen beam crossings to simulate the effect of multiple pp interactions and detector noise. MC events are then reconstructed using the same software that is used for data reconstruction. The W +jets and Z+jets samples are normalized to the leading-log cross section reported by alpgen times a k-factor calculated by MCFM [19]. The tt samples are normalized to a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) cross section for m t = 172.5 GeV [20], and the diboson samples (W W , W Z and ZZ) to the NLO cross section predicted by MCFM [21].

In order to correct the Monte Carlo for the small trigger inefficiency in the data, we apply a global normalization determined using a pure Z \u2192 \u2113\u2113 sample. The ratio between the data yield in this sample and the predicted yield from the inclusive Z boson cross section multiplied by the branching ratio is associated with the overall trigger efficiency, and the Monte Carlo distributions are scaled by this ratio. The multijet background is modeled using data events in which both leptons fail quality criteria (for electrons) or isolation criteria (for muons), and is normalized to the difference between data and MC in the dilepton mass window between 40 and 70 GeV.",

We apply several kinematic selection criteria to select events of this type and to minimize the contributions from SM background processes. In the single lepton channel, we require lepton p T > 50 GeV, highest jet p T > 100 GeV, E / T > 40(50) GeV for the muon (electron) channel, and that the separation in azimuthal angle \u03c6 between the lepton and the E / T be less than 2. As the signal contains real W bosons, we additionally require M W T < 150 GeV. Finally, we exploit the relationship between the lepton charge and the \u03b7 of the jet with the second-highest p T in the signal topology. This jet, which we assign to the SM quark produced in association with the vector-like quark, is emitted, in general, into one of the forward regions of the detector, and its direction is strongly correlated with the charge of the produced vector-like quark, and thus also with the charge of the lepton from its decay. We therefore require Q \u2113 \u00d7 \u03b7 j2 > 0, where Q \u2113 is the lepton charge and \u03b7 j2 is the \u03b7 of the jet with the second-highest p T in the event. This selection is efficient for the signal (\u2248 85%), while reducing the SM background by roughly a factor of two.",

Also shown in Fig. 2 is the vector-like quark mass in the dilepton channel, reconstructed as the invariant mass of the dilepton + leading jet system. Major sources of systematic uncertainty common to both analyses include modeling of W/Z+jets backgrounds (15%); cross sections for tt (10%), diboson (6%), and W /Z+jets (6%) production; and jet energy scale and resolution (1%-5%). Major systematic uncertainties unique to the single lepton analysis include integrated luminosity (6.1%) [22], lepton identification efficiencies (3%), high-p T muon modeling, and trigger modeling (1%). A systematic uncertainty of 5% is assigned to the global background normalization applied to the dilepton MC samples. Systematic uncertainties on multijet normalization are 6.5%-100%, depending on the channel. These do not have a large effect on the overall background prediction, as the estimated multijet background is small after the final selection. We observe a slight, but not statistically significant, excess for m Q \u2243 500 GeV, and set mass-dependent limits on vector-like quark production cross sections. We employ a modified frequentist approach using the D0 likelihood fitter [23] that incorporates a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test statistic [24]. We derive p-values for both the signal plus background (H S+B ) and background-only ( transverse mass for decays to W q and the vector-like quark mass for decays to Zq, we obtain 95% C.L. limits on vector-like quark production cross sections. These are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, along with leading order theoretical predictions for two different scenarios. For the case of\u03ba uD = 1 and\u03ba uU = \u221a 2 with no coupling to the down quark, we exclude masses below 693 GeV for a vectorlike quark decaying exclusively to W q and masses below 551 GeV for a vector-like quark decaying exclusively to Zq at the 95% C.L. For an alternate scenario defined b\u1ef9 \u03ba dU = 1 and\u03ba dD = \u221a 2 with no coupling to the up quark, the corresponding mass limits are 403 GeV and 430 GeV, respectively. The theoretical curves of the two alternative models, representing charged-current and neutral-current decays of isolated up-and down-type vector-like quarks, can be used to construct any combination of couplings by adding the cross sections with appropriate weights.",
