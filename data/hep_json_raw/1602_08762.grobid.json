            "text": "A search is presented for narrow heavy resonances X decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons (H) in protonproton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The search considers HH resonances with masses between 1 and 3 TeV, having final states of two b quark pairs. Each Higgs boson is produced with large momentum, and the hadronization products of the pair of b quarks can usually be reconstructed as single large jets. The background from multijet and tt events is significantly reduced by applying requirements related to the flavor of the jet, its mass, and its substructure. The signal would be identified as a peak on top of the dijet invariant mass spectrum of the remaining background events. No evidence is observed for such a signal. Upper limits obtained at 95 % confidence level for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction \u03c3 (gg \u2192 X) B(X \u2192 HH \u2192 bbbb) range from 10 to 1.5 fb for the mass of X from 1.15 to 2.0 TeV, significantly extending previous searches. For a warped extra dimension theory with a mass scale R = 1 TeV, the data exclude radion scalar masses between 1.15 and 1.55 TeV.",

Many BSM theories suggest the existence of narrow heavy particles X that can decay to a pair of Higgs bosons [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. The natural width for such a resonance is expected to be a few percent of its pole mass m X , which corresponds to a typical detector resolution. In contrast, the SM production of Higgs boson pairs results in a broad distribution of effective mass, falling mainly in the range from 300 to 600 GeV. Thus the presence of a narrow e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch state would be readily detected, even if produced with a cross section as small as that for the SM process.",

The radion is a spin-0 resonance associated with the fluctuations in the length of the extra dimension. The production cross section as a function of m X is proportional to 1/ 2 R , where R is the scale parameter of the theory. In this paper we consider two cases: R = 1 and 3 TeV. In the first case, the WED theory predicts a cross section that can be detected at the LHC [17], but is challenged by the constraints derived from the electroweak precision measurements [29]. This specific model is excluded up to m X = 1.1 TeV by the previous X \u2192 HH searches [14,17]. In contrast, the predicted cross section for R = 3 TeV is a factor of 9 times smaller, but the theory is less constrained by these searches.

In this regime each Higgs boson is produced with a large momentum and its decay products are collimated along its direction of motion. The hadronization of a pair of narrowly separated b quarks will result in a single reconstructed jet of mass compatible with m H . The H candidates are selected by employing jet substructure techniques to identify jets containing constituents with kinematics consistent with the decay of a highly boosted Higgs boson. These candidates are then required to be consistent with decays of B hadrons, based on our b tagging algorithms. The signal is identified in the dijet mass (m jj ) spectrum as a peak above a falling background which originates mainly from multijet events and tt production.",

Soft gluon radiation and a fraction of the remaining neutral pileup particles are first removed from each jet through the implementation of a jet-grooming algorithm called jet pruning [50,51]. This technique reduces significantly the mass of jets originating from quarks and gluons [52], while improving the resolution of the jets resulting from the hadronic decays of a heavy SM boson [53]. The invariant mass m P j is calculated for the two leading pruned jets. In Fig. 1, the m P j distribution of the two leading jets is shown for data, signal, and background events. For jets initiated by a quark or a gluon, m P j peaks around 15 GeV, while jets from high-momentum Higgs boson decay usually have a pruned mass around 120 GeV. The difference of \u22485 GeV relative to the nominal m H value is related to the presence of neutrinos produced by the semileptonic decays of B mesons, and the inherent nature of the pruning procedure. A small peak near 15 GeV is also observed for signal events, and corresponds mainly to asymmetric decays in which the jet pruning algorithm removes the decay products of one of the two B mesons. Each of the leading jets has to satisfy 110 < m P j < 135 GeV, a requirement that is chosen to maximize the sensitivity of the analysis to the presence of a narrow resonances. Some differences are observed between the data and background estimated from simulation. These discrepancies do not affect the results of this analysis since the background is estimated using techniques based on data only.",

The number of data events is reduced by four orders of magnitude while the signal efficiencies range from 10 to 20 % with a weak dependence on m X , and are observed to be independent of the spin of the resonance. Finally, the total acceptance times efficiency is provided in Table 1, and varies between 4.0 and 8.8 %, with the largest fraction of events populating the HPHP category. Figure 2 shows that the probability of incorrectly identifying multijet or tt events as events with two Higgs bosons is less than 0.1 %, and appears to be independent of m jj within statistical uncertainties.

            "text": "The uncertainty in the b tagging efficiency originates from the uncertainty in the data-to-simulation scale factors that  are applied to the simulated signal [55]. The scale factors are \u224890 % with an absolute uncertainty between \u00b13.8 % and \u00b114 %, depending on the value of m X . The uncertainty increases at large m X because of the limited amount of data available to constrain the scale factors. The uncertainty in the mass selection efficiency is 2.6 % for each jet and 5.2 % for the event. This uncertainty is esti-mated by studying high p T W bosons in a tt data control sample [53] and comparing to MC predictions. It includes the effect of the difference in fragmentation between light and b quarks. This uncertainty is fully correlated for all H jets. In addition, the impact of the pileup modelling uncertainty in the Higgs boson mass-tagging efficiency is assumed to be 1.5 % per jet, i.e., 3 % for the event [23]. Observed and expected 95 % CL upper limits on the product of cross section of a narrow resonance and the branching fraction \u03c3 (gg \u2192 X) B(X \u2192 HH \u2192 bbbb). Theory curves corresponding to WED models with radion are superimposed An uncertainty accounting for possible migration of signal events from the HPHP to the HPLP and LPHP categories results in uncertainties of +25 and \u221219 %, and of +59 and \u221237 % in the normalization of the HPHP category, and of both the HPLP and LPHP categories, respectively. These uncertainties are estimated by comparing the \u03c4 21 distribution in measured and simulated tt events [23,53]. It also includes a quantification of the difference between the fragmentation of W and Higgs bosons decaying hadronically. The fraction of signal events that do not enter any of the three categories changes from 2 % at 1.1 TeV to 20 % at 3.0 TeV. The uncertainty associated with migration out of the three categories is estimated to be much smaller than that associated with migration within them.",

The HPHP category is always the most sensitive, nevertheless above 2 TeV the HPLP and LPHP categories are also important because of inefficiencies in N-subjettiness at high p T . Figure 6 and Table 4 provide the combined limits. The excluded cross sections at 95 % CL vary from 10 fb at 1.15 TeV to 1.5 fb at 2 TeV. Above 2 TeV the excluded cross sections increase to 2.8 fb at 3 TeV, since the sensitivity is limited by the increasing inefficiency of H jet identification, as described in Sect. 4. Figure 7 extends the X \u2192 HH \u2192 bbbb search down to m X = 260 GeV by including limits from Ref. [17]. This search, referred to as the resolved analysis, considers a case where the decay products from two Higgs bosons are reconstructed as four jets.
