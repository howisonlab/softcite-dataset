This analysis uses the full data set recorded in 2012: 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV. The search employs techniques for reconstructing decay vertices of long-lived particles decaying to jets in the inner tracking detector and muon spectrometer. Signal events require at least two reconstructed vertices. No significant excess of events over the expected background is found, and limits as a function of proper lifetime are reported for the decay of the Higgs boson and other scalar bosons to long-lived particles and for Hidden Valley Z 0 and Stealth SUSY benchmark models. The first search results for displaced decays in Z 0 and Stealth SUSY models are presented. The upper bounds of the excluded proper lifetimes are the most stringent to date.",

The search is performed using data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These decays can result in secondary decay vertices (displaced vertices) that can be highly displaced from the IP. This analysis focuses on displaced vertices occurring in the inner tracking detector (ID) and muon spectrometer (MS). The event selection criteria and vertex reconstruction algorithms employed by this analysis result in a generic, model-independent selection of candidate events with two displaced vertices.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) include particles that are neutral, weakly coupled, and long-lived that can decay to final states containing several hadronic jets. Such extensions include gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models [1], the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with R-parity violation [2], inelastic dark matter models [3], Hidden Valley scenarios [4][5][6], stealth supersymmetry (Stealth SUSY) models [7,8], two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [9], and a recent baryogenesis model [10]. Independent of a specific model, Higgs fields (scalar fields) can couple to hiddensector fields that are singlets under the SM gauge group. Such couplings can result in the SM sector mixing with a hidden sector [11] and depending on the value of these couplings, the lifetime of the hidden-sector particles can be sufficiently long to result in highly displaced decays.",

The first involves the decay of a scalar boson to a pair of long-lived neutral particles (scalars or pseudoscalars) that each decay to a pair of hadronic jets. The second model has a heavy Z 0 boson that decays to long-lived, as well as prompt, neutral particles that decay to hadronic jets. The third is a variant of Stealth SUSY in which a pair of gluinos decay to long-lived singlinos, which in turn each decay to a low-mass gravitino and a pair of hadronic jets. While all measurements of branching ratios and couplings for the recently discovered Higgs boson are consistent with SM expectations [12][13][14][15], the current measurement uncertainties do not exclude non-SM decay modes with a branching ratio of up to 30% [15][16][17]. Therefore, the decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of long-lived scalars or pseudoscalars is also explored. Such long-lived scalars or pseudoscalars that couple to the SM by mixing with a scalar boson or the Higgs boson do so via a Yukawa coupling, and thus the couplings to fermions and antifermions are proportional to the fermion mass.",

The large number of long-lived particles per event results in a higher probability for at least one of the particles to decay sufficiently promptly to generate a jet and another to decay with a sufficiently large radius to contribute to missing transverse momentum. The negative vector sum of the momenta in the plane transverse to the beam line of all particles detected in a pp collision is called missing transverse momentum, E miss T , and its magnitude is denoted by E miss T [28,29]. A jet plus E miss T trigger is thus used for selecting events from the Z 0 model. It allows for the inclusion of events with displaced decays in the ID but none in the MS. These events belong to the Jet \u00fe E miss T channel. In scalar boson and Stealth SUSY events the two displaced decays are in an approximately back-to-back configuration and thus events do not have high E miss T . Additionally, unless one of the LLPs decays in the ID, scalar boson benchmark sample events would not contain a sufficiently high energy jet to satisfy the jet p T requirement of the Jet \u00fe E miss T trigger. To reconstruct the vertex of a displaced decay, the analysis uses two separate reconstruction algorithms: one for inner detector vertices (described in Sec. VII) and one for muon spectrometer vertices [30]. In order to reduce backgrounds, an event is considered as a signal candidate only if two displaced decays are reconstructed. This selection results in the following event topologies: two ID vertices (2IDVx), two MS vertices (2MSVx), and one vertex in the MS and one in the ID (IDVx \u00fe MSVx). The analysis is structured in a way that makes it sensitive to many models with displaced decays. Although events are required to have two reconstructed vertices, other reconstructed objects may be present. The topologies applicable and models analyzed for each analysis channel are summarized in Table I.",

Stealth SUSY events are generated with MADGRAPH5.2.0.2 [34], and PYTHIA8.175 is used for hadronization. The parameterization used for the proton parton distribution function (PDF) for the scalar boson and  Z 0 simulations is MSTW2008 [35], while CTEQ6L1 [36] is used for Stealth SUSY. For all simulated samples, the propagation of particles through the ATLAS detector is modeled with GEANT4 [37] using the full ATLAS detector simulation [38] for all the simulated samples. In addition, each MC sample is overlaid with zero-bias data events that are selected from bunch crossings corresponding to one full revolution around the LHC after a high-p T interaction. This overlaid data sample correctly represents all sources of detector background such as cavern background (a gas of thermal neutrons and photons filling the ATLAS cavern during ATLAS operation), beam halo, cosmic rays, and electronic noise. It also correctly reproduces pileup interactions (multiple interactions per bunch crossing).",

The trigger selects events with a cluster of muon RoIs contained in a \u0394R \u00bc 0.4 cone that are preceded by little or no activity in the ID or calorimeters. This isolation requirement reduces backgrounds from muon bremsstrahlung and punch-through jets.

Multijet events that contain vertices should have ID tracks and jets that both connect the vertex to the IP. To reduce the acceptance of fake vertices from  multijet events, good vertices are required to be isolated with respect to ID tracks and calorimeter jets. The jets considered for isolation must satisfy both E T > 30 GeV and log 10 \u00f0E HAD =E EM \u00de < 0.5. The value log 10 \u00f0E HAD =E EM \u00de gives a measure of the fraction of energy in the jet that is deposited in the HCal (E HAD ) and the fraction deposited in the ECal (E EM ). This requirement ensures that vertices originating from long-lived particles that decay near the outer edge of the hadronic calorimeter and also have significant MS activity are not rejected. An MS vertex due to a displaced decay typically has many more hits than an MS vertex from a jet that punches through the calorimeter, so a minimum number of MDT and RPC/TGC hits is required. A maximum number of MDT hits is also applied to remove background events caused by coherent noise bursts in the MDT chambers. The minimum required number of RPC/TGC hits also helps to further reject these noisy events, since a noise burst in the MDT system is not expected to be coherent with one in the muon trigger system. Table V summarizes the optimized criteria for selecting good MS vertices. These criteria select about 60%-70% (40%-60%) of MS vertices for the scalar boson and Stealth SUSY (Z 0 ) samples, with a moderate difference between the various samples, while reducing the multijet background to a negligible value.",

The large p T requirement on the leading jet ensures minimal signal contamination, and selecting only nonleading jets provides a jet-p T spectrum comparable to the signal region. The perjet fake rate ranges from 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , with uncertainties of about 20%. A slightly different procedure is employed for the Jet \u00fe E miss T channel.

The first contains events with a leading jet with 120 GeV < p T < 300 GeV and the second with a leading jet p T > 300 GeV. A fake rate as a function of p T is obtained separately for leading and nonleading jets.

The probability of finding a vertex given a muon RoI cluster is needed to find the expected background from events with two muon RoI clusters. Two probabilities are calculated: one for finding an MS vertex given a muon RoI cluster in the barrel, P vx Bcl , and another for finding an MS vertex given a muon RoI cluster in the endcaps, P vx Ecl . These are calculated by counting the number of events with one MS vertex and one muon RoI cluster and dividing by the number of events with one muon RoI cluster. The resulting probabilities are shown in Table VII.",
