            "text": "The magnetic dipole interaction played a central role in the development of QED, and continued in that role for the Standard Model. The muon anomalous magnetic moment has served as a benchmark for models of new physics, and the present experimental value is larger than the standard-model value by more than three standard deviations. The electric dipole moment (EDM) violates parity (P ) and time-reversal (T ) symmetries, and in the context of the CP T theorem, the combination of charge conjugation and parity (CP ). Since a new source of CP violation outside of that observed in the K and B meson systems is needed to help explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe, searches for EDMs are being carried out worldwide on a number of systems. The standard-model value of the EDM is immeasurably small, so any evidence for an EDM would signify the observation of new physics. Unique opportunities exist for EDM searches using polarized proton, deuteron or muon beams in storage rings. This talk will provide an overview of the theory of dipole moments, and the relevant experiments. The connection to the transition dipole moment that could produce lepton flavor violating interactions such as \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 is also mentioned.",

Contrary what we teach our undergraduates in modern physics, the Stern-Gerlach experiment did not motivate the invention of spin, however the modern interpretation of their result is that the magnetic moment of the electron is one Bohr-magneton [3] with a g-value of two. While \"a spinning electron\" was proposed by Compton to explain ferromagnetism [1], it was the introduction of spin and the associated magnetic moment by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit to explain the fine-structure in atomic spectra [2] that was the beginning of spin physics as we now know it [3].",

            "text": "The discovery of anomalous magnetic moments was a critical event for twentieth-century physics that began with the observations that the hyperfine structure of hydrogen (HHFS) was too large [4] when compared to the standard (Dirac) theory [5]. The Dirac equation 1 i (\u2202 \u00b5 \u2212 ieA \u00b5 (x)) \u03b3 \u00b5 \u03c8 (x) = m e \u03c8 (x) predicted a magnetic dipole moment (MDM) for the electron \u00b5 e = g e Qe 2m e s , where the anomaly, defined as a e = (g e \u2212 2) 2 , is zero (1) since in Dirac theory g e \u2261 2. The increase in the hydrogen hyperfine levels could be interpreted as coming from an additional magnetic moment. Motivated by the HHFS dilemma, Schwinger [6] 1 Throughout this paper I adopt the convention e > 0. carried out what today is called \"the first loop calculation\", and predicted that the electron had an additional (anomalous) magnetic moment, a e = \u03b1/2\u03c0. The concurrent precision spectroscopy measurements of Kusch and Foley [7], obtained a value for g e that was in good agreement with Schwinger's prediction. It took some years before the equivalent measurement was made for the muon. The spinrotation experiment of Garwin, et al. [8], which was one of the pioneering experiments [8,9] that observed parity violation in muon decay, found that the observed rate of spin rotation gave g \u00b5 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.10. This result indicated \"the very strong probability that the spin of the \u00b5 + is 1 2 ,\" thereby providing the first indication that the muon behaved like a heavy electron. A second muon spin rotation experiment by Garwin et al. [10], obtained a 12% measurement of the muon anomaly, a + \u00b5 = 0.001 13 +0.000 16 \u22120.000 12 which agreed very well with the expected Schwinger value of \u03b1/2\u03c0 \u2243 0.001 161 . . .. This experiment showed conclusively that the muon did indeed have the characteristics of a heavy electron.",

Their initial experiment [13], which went unpublished until after the discovery of parity violation, achieved a limit of |d n | < 5 \u00d7 10 \u221220 e\u2022cm, a null result which has been pushed down to 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e\u2022cm during the subsequent fifty-some years.

This means that at a measurable level the Standard-Model contributions to the muon anomaly come from QED; from virtual hadrons in vacuum polarization or hadronic light-by-light scattering loops; and from loops involving the electroweak gauge bosons. In principle the technique is similar to the measurement of the electron anomaly, where muons are stored in a \"trap\" consisting of a dipole magnetic field plus an electrostatic quadrupole field. In the muon experiment, an ensemble of muons is injected into a precision storage ring.

Both the proton EDM experiment being proposed for Brookhaven, and the deuteron (and perhaps 3 He) EDM experiments being discussed for COSY present exciting and unique opportunities for direct measurements of hadronic EDMs. Perhaps it is obvious, but should convincing evidence for any EDM be found, it will be imperative that as many other EDMs as possible be measured to help sort out the source of this new CP violation.

Twenty five years later, Purcell and Ramsey [12] proposed to search for an electric dipole moment to look for New Physics (parity violation). We now recognize Dipole moments as an essential tool in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. There may already be an indication of New Physics at the loop level from the muon (g \u2212 2) experiment. The new experiment to measure a \u00b5 a factor of four more precisely at Fermilab should clarify the difference that has been observed between the Standard-Model value and experiment. The observation of an electric dipole moment would herald the discovery of a new source of CP violation, which we believe must exist to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Similarly, a discovery in the on-going searches for charged lepton flavor violation at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Fermilab, J-PARC, and the B Factories would also herald New Physics at work in the charged lepton sector.",
