The decay is consequently rare in the SM, with a branching fraction of order 10 \u22126 [1]. In extensions of the SM the branching fraction and angular distribution of the decay can be modified significantly, with the latter providing a large number of particularly sensitive observables (see e.g. ref. [2]). The rate and angular distribution of corresponding B meson decays have been studied by the Bfactory experiments, CDF at the Tevatron and the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC. A global analyses of the measurements favours a modification of the coupling strengths of the b to s transition from their SM values at the level of 4 to 5 standard deviations [3][4][5][6][7]. The decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has several important phenomenological differences -1 -",

This is consistent with recent SM predictions based on Lattice QCD calculations of the form factors of the decay [1]. The angular distribution of the decay was studied for the first time in ref.

The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance between a track and a primary pp interaction vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH1 and RICH2) [21]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified with a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [22]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [23], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The signal candidates are required to pass through a hardware trigger that selects events containing at least one muon with large p T or a pair of muons with a large product of their transverse momenta. The p T threshold of the single muon trigger varied in the range between 1 and 2 GeV/c, depending on the datataking conditions. The subsequent software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from any PV. At least one of the tracks must have a transverse momentum p T > 1 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [24] is used to identify whether the secondary vertex is consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

This indicates an excellent agreement between the two data sets and suggests that the production polarisation is consistent for the centre-of-mass energies studied. The Run 1 and Run 2 data samples are therefore combined and the observables are determined on the combined sample. The results are given in table 1. The correlation between the angular observables is presented in appendix D. Figure 2 shows the one-dimensional angular projections of cos \u03b8 , cos \u03b8 b , cos \u03b8, \u03c6 and \u03c6 b for the background-subtracted candidates. The data are described well by the product of the angular distributions obtained from the moment analysis and the efficiency model. Figure 3 compares the measured observables with their corresponding SM predictions, obtained from the EOS software [38] using the values of the \u039b 0 b production polarisation measured in ref. [34]. The values of the observables K 11 to K 34 are consistent with zero. This is expected from measurements of the angular distribution of the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b by CMS [36] and LHCb [34], which indicate that the production polarisation of \u039b 0 b baryons is small in pp collisions at 7 and 8 TeV. The measurements are consistent with the SM predictions for K 1 to K 10 . The largest discrepancy is seen in K 6 , which is 2.6 standard deviations from the SM prediction. The angular observables result in an angular distribution that is not positive for all values of the angles. To obtain a physical angular distribution, K 6 has to move closer to its SM value. The measured K i values are also consistent with the values predicted by new physics scenarios favoured by global fits to data from b to s quark transitions [3][4][5][6][7]. These new physics scenarios result in only a small change of K 1 to K 10 in the low-recoil region.",

Where possible, systematic uncertainties are estimated using pseudoexperiments. These are generated from a systematically varied model and the observables are then estimated using the nominal analysis, neglecting the variation in the generation. The sources of systematic uncertainty considered are listed in table 2. In general, systematic uncertainties are found to be small compared to the statistical uncertainties on the measurements. The largest systematic uncertainties in modelling the angular efficiency are from the size of the simulated data samples and the order of the Legendre polynomials used to parameterise the efficiency. The former is determined by bootstrapping the simulated sample and re-evaluating the model. The latter is estimated by increasing the order of polynomials used in the efficiency parameterisation by up to two orders. By default, the efficiency model is chosen to have the minimum number of terms needed to get a good description of both the simulated and the data control samples. Increasing further the number of terms results in an overfitting of statistical fluctuations in the simulated data used to determine the efficiency model (due to the limited size of the simulated data set).  A systematic uncertainty due to the modelling of the data by the simulation is estimated by varying the tracking and muon identification efficiencies, and by applying an additional correction to the p T and \u03b7 spectra of the \u039b 0 b baryons. The impact of neglecting angular resolution when determining the angular observables is estimated by smearing pseudoexperiments according to the resolution determined using simulated data.
