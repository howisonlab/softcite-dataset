The decay of \u03b7(1405) \u2192 f0(980)\u03c0 0 with a large isospin violation is observed for the first time. The width of the f0(980) observed in the dipion mass spectra is anomalously narrower than the world average. Decay rates for three-pion decays of the \u03b7 \u2032 are also measured precisely. A state near 1440 MeV/c 2 was discovered in pp annihilation at rest decaying to \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and was subsequently observed decaying to KK\u03c0 [1]. Considerable theoretical and experimental efforts have since been devoted to understand its nature. It was proposed to be a candidate for a pseudo-scalar glueball [2,3]; the measured mass, however, is much lower than that obtained from lattice QCD calculations, which is above 2 GeV/c 2 [4]. Later, experiments produced evidence that this state was really two different pseudo-scalar states, the \u03b7(1405) and the \u03b7(1475). The former has large couplings to a 0 (980)\u03c0 and KK\u03c0, while the latter mainly couples to K * K . A detailed review of the experimental situation can be found in Ref. [5].",

Backgrounds are subtracted using the f 0 (980) sideband events. For radiative J/\u03c8 decays to a J P = 0 \u2212 meson, the polar angle \u03b8 \u03b3 of the photon in the J/\u03c8 center-of-mass system should be distributed according to 1 + cos 2 \u03b8 \u03b3 .

For the J P = 1 + assumption, |\u03b1| 2 is determined to be 2.10 \u00b1 0.26 from a fit to cos \u03b8 f0(980) (Fig. 3 (c)). The fitting \u03c7 2 /n.d.f. of Fig. 3 (d) with |\u03b1| 2 = 2.10 is 59.4/15. For the J P = 0 \u2212 assumption, the fitting \u03c7 2 /n.d.f. of Fig. 3 (d) is 38.4/15. Comparing the probability of 1 + hypothesis to 0 \u2212 hypothesis, the ratio of the probabilities is 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The fitting results favor the J P = 0 \u2212 assignment of the \u03b7(1405).

A fit is performed to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum, shown in Fig. 4 (a). The shape of the \u03b7 \u2032 is obtained from MC simulation and the mass and width of the \u03b7 \u2032 are fixed to its PDG values [26]. The shape of the peaking backgrounds (J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c1 0 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c9(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )) are from exclusive MC samples with predicted background levels of 361\u00b132 and 32\u00b16 events, normalized by branching ratios in the PDG [26] and fixed in the fit. The error on the number of events is estimated by changing the normalization by one standard deviation from the PDG value. A second-order Chebychev polynomial is used to describe the sum of other non-peaking backgrounds. For \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03c7 2 (\u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) < \u03c7 2 (\u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) and |M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 m \u03b7 | > 0.03 GeV/c 2 are additionally required to remove background events from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . A fit to the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum is performed as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The shapes of the \u03b7 \u2032 and non-peaking backgrounds are described analogously to the charged mode. The efficiencies and the product branching ratios for the \u03b7 \u2032 obtained from the fit are also listed in Table I. From our measurement and the world average values for branching ratios of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 [26], we determine r \u00b1 = (8.87 \u00b1 0.98) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and r 0 = (16.41 \u00b1 1.94) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The systematic uncertainties on the signal yield arise from fit ranges, signal shapes and background estimation. In detail, for the \u03b7(1405) signal, the signal shape is given by a Breit-Wigner function with floating mass and width. Its uncertainties are estimated by fixing the mass and width of the \u03b7(1405) to the world average values.",

The branching ratio of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03b3a 0 0 (980)\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is thus expected to be less than (8.40\u00b11.75)\u00d710 \u22127 , which is much smaller than the result that we measure. Therefore, a 0 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) mixing alone can not explain the observed branching ratio of \u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 .",

The isospin violating decay \u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 is observed for the first time with a statistical significance larger than 10\u03c3 in both the charged and neutral modes. According to our measurement, the ratio of Br(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) to Br(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 a 0 0 (980)\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) is (17.9 \u00b1 4.2)% [26,27], which is one order of magnitude larger than the a 0 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) mixing intensity (less than 1%) determined at BESIII previously [28]. The measured width of the f 0 (980) is anomalously narrower than the world average. There is also evidence for an enhancement at around 1.3 GeV/c 2 (potentially from the f 1 (1285)/\u03b7(1295)) seen with a significance of 3.7\u03c3 in the charged mode and 1.2\u03c3 in the neutral mode. For the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the branching ratio that we measure is consistent with the CLEO-c measurement [30], and the precision is improved by a factor of four. For the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 , it is two times larger than the world average value [26]. Using our new measurement of the decay rates for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0, the values of r \u00b1 and r 0 are more than four standard deviations away from both \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing prediction and the chiral unitary framework prediction [19].",
