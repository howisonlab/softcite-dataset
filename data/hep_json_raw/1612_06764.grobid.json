The analysis is based on pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012. The long-distance contribution to the B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay is modelled as a sum of relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitudes representing different vector meson resonances decaying to muon pairs, each with their own magnitude and phase. The measured phases of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) resonances are such that the interference with the short-distance component in dimuon mass regions far from their pole masses is small. In addition, constraints are placed on the Wilson coefficients, C 9 and C 10 , and the branching fraction of the short-distance component is measured.",

In the Standard Model (SM), FCNC transitions are forbidden at tree level and must occur via a loop-level process. In many extensions of the SM, new particles can contribute to the amplitude of the b \u2192 s + \u2212 process changing the rate of the decay or the distribution of the final-state particles. Decays like B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 are therefore sensitive probes of physics beyond the SM.",

            "text": "Recent global analyses of measurements involving b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes report deviations from SM predictions at the level of four standard deviations [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. These differences could be explained by new short-distance contributions e-mail: patrick.haworth.owen@cern.ch from non-SM particles [1][2][3][4][5]12,16] or could indicate a problem with existing SM predictions [13,15,17]. To explain the observed tensions, long-distance effects would need to be sizeable in dimuon mass regions far from the pole masses of the resonances. Therefore, it is important to understand how well these long-distance effects are modelled in the SM and how they interfere with the short-distance contributions. Previous measurements of b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes [18][19][20][21][22][23] excluded regions of dimuon mass around the \u03c6, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) resonances. The amplitude in these mass regions is dominated by the narrow vector resonances and has a large theoretical uncertainty. These dimuon regions are therefore considered insensitive to new physics effects.",

The measurement is performed through a fit to the full dimuon mass spectrum, m \u03bc\u03bc , using a model describing the vector resonances as a sum of relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitudes. This approach is similar to that of Refs.

The model includes the \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) resonances, as well as broad charmonium states (\u03c8(3770), \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415)) above the open charm threshold. Evidence for the \u03c8(4160) resonance in the dimuon spectrum of B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays has been previously reported by LHCb in Ref. [26].

            "text": "The LHCb detector [27,28] is a single-arm forward spectrometer, covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed to study the production and decay of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system divided into three subsystems: a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a largearea silicon-strip detector that is located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes situated downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The momentum scale of tracks in the data is calibrated using the B + and J/\u03c8 masses measured in B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays [29]. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH). Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [30], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 8 [31,32] with a specific LHCb configuration [33]. The decay of the B + meson is described by EvtGen [34], which generates final-state radiation using Photos [35]. As described in Ref. [36], the Geant4 toolkit [37,38] is used to implement the interaction of the generated particles with the detector and its response. Data-driven corrections are applied to the simulation following the procedure of Ref. [23]. These corrections account for the small level of mismodelling of the detector occupancy, the B + momentum and vertex quality, and the particle identification (PID) performance. The momentum of every reconstructed track in the simulation is also smeared by a small amount in order to better match the mass resolution of the data.",

This measurement is compatible with the branching fraction reported in Ref. [22]. The two results are based on the same data and therefore should not be used together in global fits. The branching fraction reported in Ref. [22] is based on a binned measurement in q 2 regions away from the narrow resonances (\u03c6, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S)) and then extrapolated to the full q 2 range. The contribution from the broad resonances was thus included in that result.    Table 3 Branching fractions and phases for each resonance in the fit for the four solutions of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) phases. Both statistical and systematic contributions are included in the uncertainties. There is a common systematic uncertainty of 4.5%, dominated by the uncertainty on the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + branching fraction, which provides the normalisation for all measurements   A two-dimensional likelihood profile of C 9 and C 10 is also obtained as shown in Fig. 4. The intervals correspond to \u03c7 2 probabilities assuming two degrees of freedom. Only the quadrant with C 9 and C 10 values around the SM prediction is shown. The other quadrants can be obtained by mirroring in the axes. The branching fraction of the short-distance component provides a good constraint on the sum of |C 9 | 2 and |C 10 | 2 (see Eq. 1). This gives rise to the annular shape in the likelihood profile in Fig. 4. In addition, there is a modest ability for the fit to differentiate between C 9 and C 10 through the interference of the C 9 component with the resonances. The visible interference pattern excludes very small values of |C 9 |. Overall, the correlation between C 9 and C 10 is approximately 90%. The best-fit point for the Wilson coefficients (in a given quadrant of the C 9 and C 10 plane) and the corresponding B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 branching fraction are the same for the four combinations of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) phases. Including statistical and systematic uncertainties, the fit results deviate from the SM prediction at the level of 3.0 standard deviations. The uncertainty is dominated by the precision of the form factors. The best-fit point prefers a value of |C 10 | that is smaller than |C SM 10 | and a value of |C 9 | that is larger than |C SM 9 |. However, if C 10 is fixed to its SM value, the fit prefers |C 9 | < |C SM 9 |. This is consistent with the results of global fits to b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes. Given the model assumptions in this paper, the interference with the J/\u03c8 meson is not able to explain the low value of the branching fraction of the B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay while keeping the values of C 9 and C 10 at their SM predictions.",

For the branching fraction, the uncertainty is 2%, which is of similar size as the statistical uncertainty.

This is interpreted as a possible contribution from excited \u03c1, \u03c9 or \u03c6 resonances. Given the limited knowledge of the masses and widths of the states in this region, these broad states are neglected in the nominal fit. They are, however, visible in e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons vacuum polarisation data [41]. To test the effect of such states on the phases of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons, an additional relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitude is included with a width and mass that are allowed to vary in the fit. The inclusion of this Breit-Wigner amplitude marginally improves the fit quality around m \u03bc\u03bc = 1.8 GeV/c 2 and changes the J/\u03c8 (\u03c8(2S)) phase by 40% (20%) of its statistical uncertainty, which is added as a systematic effect. The magnitude of the amplitude is not statistically significant and its mean and width do not correspond to a known state. The phases of the other resonances in the fit have larger statistical uncertainties and the inclusion of this additional amplitude has a negligible effect on their fit values. Given that the contribution of this amplitude is small compared to the shortdistance component, its effect on the branching fraction is only around 1%.",

[47], where long-distance contributions are calculated at negative q 2 and extrapolated to the q 2 region below the J/\u03c8 pole-mass using a hadronic dispersion relation. The fit model, which includes the conventional J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 cc resonances, is found to describe the data well, with no significant evidence for the decays B + \u2192 \u03c8(4040)K + or B + \u2192 \u03c8(4415)K + . The values of the \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4160) phases are compatible with those reported in Ref. [13].",

If the value of C 10 is set to that of C SM 10 , the measurement favours the region |C 9 | < |C SM 9 |. These results are similar to those reported previously in global analyses. The interference between the short-and long-distance contributions in the regions around the \u03c1, \u03c9 and the \u03c6, and in the region q 2 > m 2 \u03c8(2S) , results in the exclusion of the hypothesis that C 9 = 0 at more than 5 standard deviations. The dominant uncertainty on the measurements of C 9 and C 10 arises from the knowledge of the B \u2192 K hadronic form factors. The current data set allows the uncertainties on these hadronic parameters to be reduced. Improved inputs on the form factors from lattice QCD calculations and the larger data set that will be available at the end of the LHC Run 2 are needed to further improve the measurement of the Wilson coefficients.",
