The decays to (1385) 0\u00af (1385) 0 are observed for the first time. The measured branching fractions of J /\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) to 0\u00af 0 are in good agreement with, and much more precise than, the previously published results. The angular parameters for these decays are also measured for the first time. The measured angular decay parameter for J /\u03c8 \u2192 (1385) 0\u00af (1385) 0 , \u03b1 = \u22120.64 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.10, is found to be negative, different to the other decay processes in this measurement. In addition, the \"12% rule\" and isospin symmetry in the decays of J /\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) to \u00af and (1385)\u00af (1385) are tested.",

The measured \u03b1 values are also compared with the predictions of the theoretical models from Refs. [6,7]. As indicated in Table 5, some of our results disagree significantly with the theoretical predictions, which may imply that the naive prediction of QCD suffers from the approximation that higher-order corrections are not taken into account. As calculated in Ref. [9], the sign for parameter \u03b1 in \u03c8 \u2192 0\u00af 0 mode could be negative if re-scattering effects in the final states are taken into account. However, our results show that \u03b1 for J /\u03c8 is negative, and is different to the other decay processes in this measurement, which is hard to explain within the existing models. We, therefore, believe that it is of utmost importance to improve the theoretical models to shed further light on the origin of these discrepancies. To test the \"12% rule\", the ratios of the branching fractions are calculated to be (6.44 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b1 0.64)% and (23.43 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b1 1.09)%, respectively, taking into account the cancelation of the common systematic uncertainties. The ratios are not in agreement with 12%, especially for the 0\u00af 0 final state.",

Taking into account the normalization of the luminosity and CM energy dependence of the cross section, the QED backgrounds are found to be negligible.

After applying the same event selection, it is found that the peaking backgrounds for the \u03c8 \u2192 (1385) 0\u00af (1385) 0 mode mainly come from \u03c8 \u2192 0\u00af 0 , \u2212\u00af + , (1385) \u2212\u00af (1385) + , (1530)\u00af + c.c., and \u03c0 0 \u00af (1385) 0 , where the branching fractions for \u03c8 \u2192 (1530)\u00af + c.c. and \u03c0 0 \u00af (1385) 0 are taken from the isospin partner modes J /\u03c8 \u2192 (1530)\u00af + c.c.

These include the uncertainty of the signal yield in the different cos \u03b8 intervals, the uncertainty of the cos \u03b8 fit procedure, and the uncertainty related to the detection efficiency correction curve as function of the cos \u03b8 bin. They are discussed in detail below. 1. The signal yields in each cos \u03b8 interval are determined by the fit to the corresponding M recoil \u03c0 0 distribution. The sources of the systematic uncertainty of the signal yield include the fit range, the background shape, MC resolution and wrong combination, where the MC resolution is fixed for the decay \u03c8(3686) \u2192 (1385) 0\u00af (1385) 0 only. To estimate the systematic uncertainty related with fit range on M recoil \u03c0 0 , we repeat the fit to the M recoil \u03c0 0 distribution by changing the fit range by \u00b110 MeV/c 2 . Then, the \u03b1 values are extracted by the fit with the changed signal yield, and the resulting differences to the nominal \u03b1 values are taken as the systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties related to the background shape, MC resolution and wrong combination backgrounds in the fit are evaluated with a method similar to the one described above. 2. The systematic uncertainties related to the procedure of the fit on the cos \u03b8 distribution are estimated by re-fitting the cos \u03b8 distribution with a different binning and fit range. We divide cos \u03b8 into 8 intervals for \u03c8 \u2192 0\u00af 0 and 16 intervals for \u03c8 \u2192 (1385) 0\u00af (1385) 0 . The changes of the \u03b1 values are taken as systematic uncertainties. We also repeat the fit by changing the range to [\u22120.9, 0.9] or [\u22120.7, 0.7] in cos \u03b8 , with the same bin size of the nominal fit. The largest differences of \u03b1 value with respect to the nominal value are taken as systematic uncertainties.",
