The diphoton mass spectrum from 150 to 850 GeV is used to search for an excess of events over the background. The search is extended to new resonances with natural widths of up to 10% of the mass value. No evidence for new particle production is observed and limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section times branching fraction to diphotons are determined. These limits are interpreted in terms of two-Higgs-doublet model parameters.",

Despite the large nonresonant background, the diphoton decay mode provides a clean final-state topology that allows the mass of the decaying object to be reconstructed with high precision, exploiting the excellent performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment. The analysis searches for local excesses that could be due to the production of particles that decay into two photons with mass in the range from 150 to 850 GeV. Both narrow and wide resonances are investigated with natural widths ranging from 100 MeV to 10% of the resonance mass. This search covers the diphoton mass range above that investigated in [2,4]. The ATLAS E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. experiment recently published a similar search for narrow resonances in the diphoton final state in the mass range between 65 and 600 GeV at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV [5].

Generally, these models provide an extension of the Higgs sector, where a total of five Higgs bosons are predicted by the theory. The mass spectrum of the 2HDM can be split into two regions: a light SMlike Higgs boson h with mass around 125 GeV and the remaining physical Higgs bosons, H, a scalar, A, a pseudoscalar, and H \u00b1 , clustered at an equal or higher scale with m H \u223c m A \u223c m H \u00b1 . Under the assumption that the newly observed Higgs boson is the light CPeven Higgs scalar of the 2HDM, the consistency of its couplings with those predicted by the SM pushes the model close to the so called alignment limit [11], where certain decay modes of heavy neutral Higgs bosons vanish, including H \u2192 VV (where V is a vector boson), H \u2192 hh, and A \u2192 Z h. At the same time, decays of H and A to \u03b3 \u03b3 and \u03c4 \u03c4 become increasingly important and the electroweak production modes, such as vector boson fusion or prohttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2015.09.062 0370-2693/\u00a9 2015 CERN for the benefit of the CMS Collaboration.

This condition is satisfied in the 2HDM by four discrete combinations of the Yukawa couplings of the fermions to the Higgs doublets. In the Type I scenario all fermions couple to one doublet, while in Type II up-type quarks couple to one doublet and down-type quarks and leptons couple to the other.

Spin-2 particles decaying into two photons are predicted by other extensions of the SM such as the Randall-Sundrum [15] and the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali [16] models. These theories predict a distinct higher-dimensional scenario, which provides an approach to the hierarchy problem alternative to supersymmetry.

The pythia tune used for the underlying event activity is Z2* [22]. New resonances X are simulated with a natural width of 0.1 GeV which is smaller than the value of the mass resolution in the energy range considered. Both spin-0 and spin-2 hypotheses are considered. Simulated signal samples of X \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 events are generated with pythia [21] for the gluon fusion process with the following mass hypotheses: 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 600 and 850 GeV. Interference between the signal and the background is studied using sherpa 2.1.0 [23,24]. The exclusion limits detailed in Section 7 are computed using either a signal plus interference template given by sherpa or the Breit-Wigner theoretical model described in Section 6.1. The inclusion of the interference in our signal model affects the expected and observed upper limits on the signal yields at the level of 3% or less. The effect is therefore negligible compared to the systematic uncertainties, described in Section 6.3, and is not included in the final results. Simulated backgrounds include the diphoton continuum process involving two prompt photons, generated with sherpa 1.4.2 [23], and processes where one of the photon candidates arises from misidentified jet fragments, simulated with pythia. These two contributions repre-sent 97% of the total background in this analysis. A less than 3% contribution is expected from QCD events in which both photons candidates arise from misidentified jet fragments; this contribution is neglected in the analysis.",

The clustering algorithms account for about 98% of the energy of the photons, including those that undergo conversion and bremsstrahlung in the material in front of the ECAL. Groups of clusters are used to form superclusters. In the barrel region, superclusters are formed from five-crystal-wide strips in \u03b7, centered on the locally most energetic crystal (seed), and have a variable extension in \u03c6 to take into account the effect of the magnetic field on electrons from photons showering before ECAL. In the endcaps, where the crystals are arranged according to an x-y rather than an \u03b7-\u03c6 geometry, matrices of 5 \u00d7 5 crystals, which may partially overlap and are centered on the seed crystal, are summed if they lie within a narrow \u03c6 road. About half of the photons convert into e + e \u2212 pairs in the material upstream of the ECAL.

Two simple classifiers are used: the minimum R 9 and the maximum pseudorapidity of the two photons. Photons with a high value of the R 9 variable are predominantly unconverted, have a better energy resolution than those with a lower value, and are less likely to arise from misidentification of jet fragments. Similarly, photons in the barrel have better energy resolution than those in the endcap and are less likely to be incorrectly identified. The classification scheme groups together events with good diphoton mass resolution, resulting from photons with good energy resolution and with better signal-to-background ratio. The event class definitions are shown in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the signal efficiency times the acceptance of the event selection as a function of the mass hypothesis for a narrow spin-0 scalar resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion. The shaded region shows the systematic uncertainty due to different sources as described in Section 6.3. The acceptance over the full mass range is also evaluated for the pseudoscalar hypothesis and found to be compatible with that measured for the scalar reso- nances within the uncertainties. For the spin-2 scenario the corresponding numbers are about 5-10% smaller, because of differences in acceptance between the two models. Fig. 2 shows the diphoton invariant mass distribution for selected events in data and MC simulation, normalized to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , for all event classes combined.

A scan of the signal mass and the signal width is performed. The signal and background normalizations are allowed to float, together with the parameters which describe the background shape. The log-likelihood ratio is used as test statistic. The signal model is derived from MC simulation as described in Section 6.1, with corrections determined from data-MC comparisons applied. The functional form of the background distribution is determined by fitting the measured m \u03b3 \u03b3 distribution as detailed in Section 6.2.

            "text": "The modeling of the background relies entirely on the data, so there are no systematic uncertainties due to potential mismodeling of the background processes by the MC simulation. Because the exact functional form of the background in each event class is not known, the parametric model must be flexible enough to describe a variety of potential underlying functions. Using an incorrect background model can lead to biases in the measured signal yield, which can strongly reduce the sensitivity of the analysis to any potential signal. The procedure used to determine the background fitting function, which results in a negligible bias, is presented here. In this study the bias on the fitted signal yield is defined as the difference between the number of fitted signal events and the number of expected signal events. A set of analytical functions that could describe the unknown true background distribution in data is first determined. The five functions considered as possible truth models are analytical forms that are used in dijet resonance searches [38] to describe both data and QCD predictions and models that are frequently used in diphoton resonance searches [2]. The bias study procedure described below is performed considering each function among the available set of models. The candidate fitting function that performs best in this study is f 0 , the product of exponential and power-law functions: As an example, the fits of this model to the data in the four event classes are shown in Fig. 5 for the fit range [240, 640] GeV, used for searching for a peak near 350 GeV. In order to check that a background fit model results in a negligible bias in the fitted signal yield, we construct pseudo-data sets with the other four analytical models by randomly drawing diphoton mass values from them. The number of background events generated in each set is equal to the number of events observed in data in a fixed mass range. Background-only pseudo-data sets are then fitted with the signal + background probability density function. The criterion for the bias to be negligible is that it must be five times smaller than the statistical uncertainty in the number of fitted signal events for all four types of pseudo-data sets across the entire mass region of interest. When this criterion is satisfied, any potential bias from the background fit function can be neglected in comparison with the statistical uncertainty from the finite data sample. The functional form of the truth model being fixed, the lower and upper bounds of the fit range are varied for each hypothetical resonance mass in order to minimize the bias. The desired fit range for each hypothetical mass is the one that gives the smallest bias for all the truth models considered. This study is performed for a resonance with width equal to 10% of its mass, as the bias tends to increase with increasing resonance width. The optimal lower and upper bounds of the fit range are parametrized as a function of the resonance mass with polynomial functions.",

Fig. 6 shows the 95% confidence level (CL) exclusion limits  on the production cross section times branching fraction (\u03c3 B), obtained by combining all four event classes, as a function of mass for a narrow ( X = 0.1 GeV) spin-2 resonance.

The mixing angle between H and h is given by \u03b1, while tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets.

Widths of the resonance X in the range 0.1 GeV to 0.1m X are investigated. Both spin-0 and spin-2 scenarios are considered. A fit to the diphoton invariant mass distribution in data is performed using a parametric model for the signal and a background shape obtained directly from data. No evidence for a signal is observed, and upper exclusion limits at 95% CL are set on the production cross section times branching fraction. The modelindependent upper limits extend over considerably wider mass and width ranges than in previous searches. We further interpret these limits in the context of the 2HDM, presenting exclusion contours in the tan \u03b2 versus cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) plane. This is the first search for heavy diphoton resonances carried out at the LHC to be interpreted in terms of the 2HDM.",
