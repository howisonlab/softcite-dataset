            "text": "Production of neutrinos is abundant at LHC. Flavour composition and energy reach of the neutrino flux from proton-proton collisions depend on the pseudorapidity \u03b7. At large \u03b7, energies can exceed the TeV, with a sizeable contribution of the \u03c4 flavour. A dedicated detector could intercept this intense neutrino flux in the forward direction, and measure the interaction cross section on nucleons in the unexplored energy range from a few hundred GeV to a few TeV. The high energies of neutrinos result in a larger \u03bdN interaction cross section, and the detector size can be relatively small. Machine backgrounds vary rapidly while moving along and away from the beam line. Four locations were considered as hosts for a neutrino detector: the CMS quadruplet region ( 25 m from CMS Interaction Point (IP)), UJ53 and UJ57 (90 and 120 m from CMS IP), RR53 and RR57 (240 m from CMS IP), TI18 (480 m from ATLAS IP). The potential sites are studied on the basis of (a) expectations for neutrino interaction rates, flavour composition and energy spectrum, (b) predicted backgrounds and in-situ measurements, performed with a nuclear emulsion detector and radiation monitors. TI18 emerges as the most favourable location. A small detector in TI18 could measure, for the first time, the high-energy \u03bdN cross section, and separately for \u03c4 neutrinos, with good precision, already with 300 fb \u22121 in the LHC Run3.",

Their energies extend into the TeV range. TeV-neutrino interactions on nucleons are currently uncharted physics [1]; only a few interactions of muonic neutrinos of cosmic origin with energies beyond 6 TeV were recorded in IceCube [2]. LHC neutrinos offer the unique possibility of probing the neutrino-nucleon interaction in the range from a few hundred GeV to a few TeV in laboratory. Furthermore, the contribution of the \u03c4 flavour to the LHC neutrino flux is sizeable. \u03c4 neutrino interactions on nucleons are mostly unexplored, since so far only a handful of events have been recorded ( [3], [4], [5]) at low energies.",

In a recent paper [9] it was pointed out that at larger angles (4< |\u03b7| <5), leptonic W decays also provide an additional contribution to the neutrino flux ( about 30% have \u03c4 flavour): in these events the charged lepton could be detected in coincidence within the central \u03b7 region by existing experiments, ATLAS and CMS, providing an independent determination of the neutrino flavour.",

For the Charged Current cross section of \u03c4 neutrinos on nucleons, we can only refer to theoretical expectations [15], that take into account the effect of the F4 and F5 structure functions [16]. As an example, the interaction of a muon neutrino of 30 GeV on nucleons has a cross section of about 20 \u00d710 \u221238 cm 2 , and a \u03c4 neutrino of 600 GeV of about 350 \u00d710 \u221238 cm 2 ; for anti-\u03bd the cross section is about a half that of \u03bd. Table 2 summarizes the expected neutrino interactions for 3000 fb \u22121 of pp collision events, separately for heavy quark production and for W production.",

In each position two devices were installed, with different thresholds, so to infer both the high energy hadron and the thermal neutron components separately. The monitors were retracted at the same time of the emusion package, and analysed [28].

The analysis considered only emulsion track-lets in which hits in two sensitive layers were aligned within a \u03c7 2 cut off, chosen the same way as for cosmic muon tracks. Each track-let provided two measurements: the \u03b8 x and \u03b8 y directions. The emulsion package was distant 5.5 m in X , and -1.0 m below the beam axis in Y. Each of the ten emulsions independently showed two peaks in the track angle distribution, on top of a uniform background. One was at about 280 mrad in \u03b8 x and at about -50 mrad in \u03b8 y . Tracks in this peak pointed towards the beam line and indicated a source at a distance of about 5.5m/280mrad= 20 meters upstream along the beam line, which is confirmed by the orthogonal measurement -1m/50mrad= 20 m. Backgrounds depend on the machine configuration; during the emulsion exposure, the dominant contribution was expected to originate in the nearest quadrupole magnet, in agreement with the measurement. The other peak in the distribution of track-let angles was sharp at 20 mrad in \u03b8 x and at a few mrad below 0 in \u03b8 y . Since the package was at 247 m from the IP, it is expected that muon track-lets will have directions 5.5m/247m=22 mrad in X and -1m/247m= -4 mrad in Y, which is in good agreement with the observed peak. The size of the Ag clusters along a track in the peak is compatible with that of muons, as determined in cosmic muon mesurements. The track population in the 22 mrad peak was measured to be 10 5 /cm 2 /fb \u22121 , independently in each layer of the package, in good agreement with the expected flux of muons from the IP in the psudorapidity range 4< |\u03b7| <5 (Section 3.3). The track population in the 280 mrad peak was determined to be 10 6 /cm 2 /fb \u22121 . This is consistent with the charged hadron fluence measured with the Radiation Monitors. A background of 10 7 /cm 2 /fb \u22121 track-lets at random angles was observed to populate the emulsions uniformly. Although in the centre of the RR53 hall the neutron flux is measured to be ten times smaller than in the VN location covering the same pseudorapidity range, it is not clear  Figure 7: Distributions of the measured inclinations of the observed particle tracks, horizontally (\u03b8 x ) and vertically, (\u03b8 y ) in two emulsion films, from an early layer and from a layer deep in the stack, about the 280 mrad peak; the region close to 0 angles has been cut off for enhancing visibiity.",

The existing space is limited in length to a few meters, and the floor lies a 20-50 cm higher than the PBA. For the sake of site comparison, a small size detector with a half-cylinder shape, only the upper half, with axis at the bottom along the PBA, with a radius of 1.2 meter, and a mass of 1.4\u00d710 27 nucleons/cm 2 , 2 meters of lead, 10 ton/m, is considered. The detector would cover the region of |\u03b7| > 6.7; neutrinos have very high energies, as shown in table 1, therefore the \u03bdN interaction cross section is large, hence the detector size can be small.",

An experiment in VN would be sensitive to leptonic W decays where the charged lepton is observed in CMS; however the background level makes the VN location prohibitive. The VF location shows a sustainable level of background; in particular the thermal neutron fluence would allow use of liquid scintillator detectors, as in reactor neutrino experiments [31]. The flux of cosmic muons will be large with respect to deep underground neutrino experiments, but the event rate will be low because of the much smaller detector size.

In the VF location, the background level would allow those same emulsions to stand 50-100 fb \u22121 and to still remain within the track density limit for analysis. This opens an interesting opportunity for the forthcoming LHC run in 2021-2023, which is expected to deliver 300 fb \u22121 . A small size detector made of emulsions and lead, located in TI18, with 1% of the volume as for the VF case study, would collect a thousand neutrino interactions with energy ranging from 100 to 1000 GeV. The \u03bdN cross section at high energy would be measured to 5%, and to 30% for tau neutrinos. The lower track density required by the emulsion can be achieved by replacing the emulsions three to five times per year. This unique opportunity that LHC offers in Run3 will be the subject of further studies, including exploration of other detector technologies. ",
