            "text": "Quarkonium is a bound state of a Q andQ pair, where Q can be either a charm quark (therefore forming a charmonium state) or a bottom quark (bottomonium state). Since thirty years, quarkonia are considered important probes of the formation, in heavy-ion collisions, of a strongly interacting medium, the so-called quark gluon plasma (QGP). In a hot and deconfined medium, in fact, quarkonium production is expected to be significantly suppressed with respect to the proton-proton yield, scaled by the number of binary nucleonnucleon collisions. The origin of such a suppression, taking place in the QGP, is the color screening of the force which binds the cc (bb) state [1]. In this scenario, quarkonium suppression should occur sequentially, according to the binding energy of each meson. In the charmonium sector strongly bound states, as the J/\u03c8, should melt at higher temperatures with respect to the more loosely bound \u03c7 c or \u03c8(2S) resonances, while in the bottomonium sector, the \u03a5(1S) is expected to melt at a higher temperature with respect to the \u03c7 b or \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S). As a consequence, the in-medium dissociation probability of these states should provide an estimate of the initial temperature reached in the collisions [2]. However, the connection between the dissociation temperature and the disappearance of a given quarkonium state is not yet straightforward. From the theory point of view, large uncertainites are still associated to the evaluation of such a temperature, depending on the adopted approach as lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), QCD sum rules, AdS/QCD, resummed perturbation theory, effective field theories or potential models [3]. From the experimental point of view, the prediction of a sequential suppression pattern is complicated by several factors as the feeddown contributions from higher-mass resonances into the observed quarkonium yield and the B-hadrons decay into charmonium. Furthermore, other hot and cold matter effects can play a role, competing with the suppression mechanism. Increasing the center of mass energy of the collisions ( \u221a s ), an increase of the production of Q andQ quarks is expected. Therefore, in high-\u221a s NN interactions the abundance of Q and Q quarks might lead to a new quarkonium production source, originating from the (re)combination of these quarks during the collision history [4] or at the hadronization [5,6]. This additional production mechanism is related to the formation of a hot medium and is particularly important for charmonium states, given the higher number of cc with respect to bb pairs. (Re)combination is expected to enhance the J/\u03c8 yields, therefore smoothening or even counterbalancing the effect of the suppression mechanism. Quarkonium is also expected to be affected by several effects related to cold matter (the so-called cold nuclear matter effects, CNM). For example, the production cross section of the QQ pair is influenced by the kinematic distributions of partons in the nuclei, which are different from those in free protons and neutrons (this effect is known as nuclear shadowing [7,8,9]). In a similar way, approaches based on the Color-Glass Condensate effective theory [10,11] assume that gluon saturation is expected to set in at high energies. This effect influences the quarkonium production occurring through fusion of gluons carrying small values of the Bjorxen-x in the nuclear target. Furthermore, parton energy loss may decrease the pair momentum [12,13], causing a reduction of the quarkonium production at large longitudinal momentum. Finally, while the QQ pair evolves towards the final quarkonium state, it may also interact with the medium and eventually break-up. This effect is expected to play a dominant role only for low-\u221a s NN collisions, where the crossing time of the (pre)-resonant state in the nuclear environement is rather large. Cold nuclear matter effects are investigated in proton-nucleus collisions, where no hot medium is expected to be formed. Since these effects are also present in nucleus-nucleus interactions, a precise knowledge of their role is crucial to correctly quantify the influence of the hot QCD medium on quarkonium. The in-medium modification of quarkonium production, induced by either hot or cold matter effects, is evaluated through the nuclear modification factor R AA , defined as the ratio of the quarkonium yield in A-A collisions (Y qq AA ) and the expected value obtained by scaling the pp yield (Y qq pp ) by the average number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, N coll , evaluated through a Glauber model calculation:",

            "text": "The \"history\" of quarkonium studies in heavy-ion collisions dates back to 30 years ago, when the first measurements were performed at the CERN SPS at \u221a s NN =17 GeV. This first measurements, limited only to the charmonium family [14,15], provide an indication for a clear suppression of the J/\u03c8 meson (the socalled \"anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression\"), well beyond the expectations of cold nuclear matter effects. Starting from year 2000, charmonium and first bottomonium results were achieved also at RHIC at the top energy of \u221a s NN =200 GeV. In the following years, the RHIC quarkonium program focussed on the investigation of the quarkonium production by varying the colliding beam species and the energy of the collisions. Results obtained at \u221a s NN =200 GeV indicate a J/\u03c8 suppression similar to the one observed at SPS, although the factor \u223c10 increase in center of mass energy [16,17]. Furthermore, unexpectedly, a stronger J/\u03c8 suppression has been measured at RHIC at forward with respect to mid-rapidity (y), in spite of the higher energy density which is reached close to y \u223c 0. These observations suggest the existence of the previously mentioned (re)combination process, which might set in already at RHIC energies and which may counteract the quarkonium suppression in the QGP. At LHC, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS eventually carried out studies on quarkonium in Pb-Pb collisions at the center of mass energy of \u221a s NN =2.76 TeV (LHC Run-I). The high-energy density of the medium and the large number of cc pairs produced in central Pb-Pb collisions make measurements at LHC energy an excellent testing ground for suppression and (re)combination scenarios. Furthermore, the study of the bottomonium, now largely accessible due to the \u221a s -increase of the b production cross-section, allows a deeper understanding on quarkonium behaviour in A-A.",

The corresponding nuclear modification factor, as a function of the number of participant nucleons (N part ), is shown in Fig. 1 (left) where it is compared to the R AA measured by the PHENIX experiment [17] in a similar kinematic range. There is a clear evidence for a smaller J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC energies, with respect to RHIC. Furthermore, while PHENIX result shows an increasing J/\u03c8 suppression towards the most central events, the ALICE J/\u03c8 R AA saturates for N part >100. Partonic transport models, which include, as J/\u03c8 production process, the (re)combination of cc pairs along the history of the collisions, indeed predict such a behaviour [20,21]. The smaller suppression at the LHC is due to the larger cc pair multiplicity which allows a new production source to set in, resulting in a compensation of the suppression from color screening. A similar behaviour is expected by the statistical model [6], where the J/\u03c8 yield is completely determined by the chemical freeze-out conditions and by the abundance of cc pairs. A more precise comparison between the experimental result and the theory predictions would clearly benefit from an experimental measurement of the charm production cross-section, which represents one of the main sources of theory uncertainties.",

This observation is confirmed by the mid-rapidity R AA measured by CMS [22] and STAR [23] for high-p T J/\u03c8, i.e. for J/\u03c8 in a kinematic region where the (re)combination contribution can be neglected. As shown in Fig. 1(right), the J/\u03c8 suppression, in this case, is stronger at LHC energies, as expected from a QGP dissociation scenario. The mid-rapidity STAR R AA measurement is also confirmed by the new results obtained at forward y [24].",

Results, presented as a double ratio Fig. 1. Left: ALICE [18] and PHENIX [17] inclusive low p T J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor versus the number of participant nucleons at forward rapidity. Right: CMS [22] and STAR [23] high-p T J/\u03c8 R AA versus N part . of the \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 yields in Pb-Pb and in pp collisions as a function of centrality, are shown in Fig.2 for CMS [29,30] (left) and for ALICE [19,25] (right). CMS observes values higher than one in the region 1.6< |y| <2.4, 3<p T <30 GeV/c, implying a \u03c8(2S) R AA larger than the J/\u03c8 one. Later \u03c8(2S) (re)generation, when radial flow is stronger, might explain the observed rise [31]. Results obtained in the range |y| <1.6 and 6.5<p T <30 GeV/c show a decreasing pattern towards most central collisions, i.e. the \u03c8(2S) R AA is, in this case, smaller than the corresponding J/\u03c8 value, as expected in a sequential suppression scenario. AL-ICE explores a contiguous range in rapidity (2.5< y <4) and also extend the p T reach of this measurement down to zero, showing a trend in agreement with transport models [32] and with the statistical hadronization approach [33]. Unfortunately, the large statistics and systematic uncertainties associated to the \u03c8(2S) measurement preclude the drawing of strong conclusions on the \u03c8(2S) behavior and on its kinematic dependence. Also this measurement will surely benefit from the high quarkonium statistics collected in LHC Run-II.

This study can be addressed thanks to the d-Au and the very recent p-A runs at RHIC energies ( \u221a s NN =200 GeV) or the LHC p-Pb run at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. Similarly to what is done to quantify how the medium affects quarkonium production in Pb-Pb collisions, cold nuclear matter effects are usually investigated through the nuclear modification factor R pA (R dAu ). At LHC energies, J/\u03c8 R pA has been studied by both ALICE [41,42,43,44] and LHCb [45,46] at forward and backward y, down to p T =0, and by ATLAS [47,48,49] in the central rapidity region, focussing, in this case, only on the high-p T J/\u03c8 production. The J/\u03c8 R pA shows a strong dependence on rapidity and p T . While at backward-y (correponding to the Pb nucleus flight direction), R pA is close to unity, with a rather flat trend versus p T , at forward-y (corresponding to the proton flight direction) an increase towards high-p T is observed. At mid-y the R pA shows a small p T dependence, with a clear flattening in the high p T range covered by ATLAS. Fig. 4. J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor (Q pA ), measured by ALICE [43], as a function of centrality, at backward (left), mid (center) and forward rapidity.

At RHIC or LHC energies, the time spent by the cc pair in the created medium is much shorter that the time needed to the pair to evolve into a fully formed resonance state as the J/\u03c8 or the \u03c8(2S). Therefore, cold nuclear matter effects affect only the pre-resonant state and are expected to be very similar for the two charmonium states. However, at LHC [53,44,54,46] and at RHIC, both in mid-y d-Au and in backward-y p-A collisions [55,56], the \u03c8(2S) suppression is unexpectedly found to be stronger than the J/\u03c8 one, as shown in Fig. 5 (left). The \u03c8(2S) nuclear modification factor, as a function of centrality [44], shows an increase of the suppression in most central collisions, with, in particular at backward-y, a rather different behaviour with respect to the the J/\u03c8 one (Fig. 5). While the J/\u03c8 behaviour can be explained in terms of nuclear shadowing or energy loss, an additional mechanism, affecting only the weakly bound \u03c8(2S), is required to explain the observed pattern. A plausible explanation for the stronger suppression requires, therefore, the introduction of the \u03c8(2S) dissociation by comovers in a hadronic medium, created in p-A collisions with or without the existence of a short-lived QGP phase [57,31].  [56]. Right: \u03c8(2S)R pA measured by ALICE [44] at backward y, compared to the corresponding J/\u03c8 one and to the theoretical calculations discussed in the text.",

In the rather large rapidity range covered by these experiments, no clear y dependence for the \u03a5(1S) state is observed, as shown in Fig.6 (left). The centrality dependence is also rather flat and the R pA is consistent with unity, indicating weak cold nuclear matter effects affecting the \u03a5(1S). The excited \u03a5 states, measured by CMS [34] show a stronger suppression with respect to the \u03a5(1S), suggesting final states at play, as also discussed in the charmonium sector. The p T and y dependence of this effect is feeble, as measured by ATLAS [49].",

These results, which refer to several charmonium and bottomonim states in different, but complementary, kinematic regions allow a deeper understanding of the quarkonium behaviour in A-A interactions. The new results presented at the Quark Matter 2015 Conference confirm the existence of two competing processes affecting the quarkonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions: the suppression in the deconfined medium and the (re)combination of Q and Q quarks. A deeper understanding of hot medium effects requires the knowledge of the underlying effects related to cold matter and present also in p-A (d-Au) interactions.

The LHC Run-II, with a higher center of mass energy and a larger luminosity, is going to provide even more precise results, addressing also measurements which were challenging in Run-I. These new data will allow us to sharpen our knowledge, aiming to a coherent description of quarkonium production in a hot and deconfined medium, from low to very high energies.",
