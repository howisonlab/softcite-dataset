The data sample of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV was collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb \u22121 . The measured cross sections are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo generators, MadGraph + pythia and sherpa, and to nextto-leading-order calculations from BlackHat + sherpa. The differential cross sections are found to be in agreement with the predictions, apart from the p T distributions of the leading jets at high p T values, the distributions of the H T at high-H T and low jet multiplicity, and the distribution of the difference in azimuthal angle between the leading jet and the muon at low values.",

Measurements of the production of vector bosons in association with jets are fundamental tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). The W + jets processes also provide the main background to other, much rarer, standard model (SM) processes, such as tt [1] and single top-quark production [2], and to Higgs boson production and a variety of physics processes beyond the SM. Searches for phenomena beyond the SM are often limited by the uncertainty in the theoretical cross sections for W (and Z) + jets processes at high momentum scales and large jet multiplicities. Therefore, it is crucial to perform precision measurements of W + jets production at the LHC.",

            "text": "Leptonic decay modes of the vector boson are often used in the measurement of SM processes and in searches for new physics, because they provide clean signatures with relatively low background. This letter focuses on the production of a W boson decaying into a muon and a neutrino, as part of a final-state topology characterised by one high-transverse-momentum (p T ) isolated E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. muon, significant missing transverse energy (E miss T ), and one or more jets. The cross sections are measured as a function of the inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicities for up to six jets. Differential cross sections are measured for different inclusive jet multiplicities as a function of the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) of the jets, where \u03b7 = \u2212ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], and \u03b8 is the polar angle measured with respect to the anticlockwise beam direction. The cross sections are also measured as a function of the difference in azimuthal angle between the direction of each jet and that of the muon, and of H T , which is defined as the scalar sum of the p T of all jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. It is important to study the distribution of the jet p T and the observable H T because they are sensitive to higher order corrections, and are often used to discriminate against background in searches for signatures of physics beyond the SM. Additionally, H T is often used to set the scale of the hard scattering process in theoretical calculations.",

This procedure corrects a measured observable for the effects of detector response, finite experimental resolutions, acceptance, and efficiencies, and therefore allows for direct comparison with theoretical predictions. The measured differential cross sections are compared to the predictions of generators such as MadGraph 5.1.1 [11] interfaced with pythia 6.426 [12], sherpa 1.4.0 [13][14][15][16], and BlackHat [17,18], interfaced to sherpa. The BlackHat + sherpa samples [19] provide partonlevel predictions of W + n (n = 1-5) jets at next-to-leading order (NLO), while the MadGraph + pythia and sherpa samples provide tree-level calculations followed by hadronisation to produce the final states. The letter proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the CMS detector. Section 3 describes the Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, as well as the data samples used for the analysis. The identification criteria for the final-state objects (leptons and jets) and the selection of the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd + jets events are presented in Section 4.",

The detector consists of an inner tracking system and calorimeters (electromagnetic, ECAL, and hadron, HCAL) surrounded by a 3.8 T solenoid. The inner tracking system consists of a silicon pixel and strip tracker, providing the required granularity and precision for the reconstruction of vertices of charged particles in the range 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The crystal ECAL and the brass/scintillator sampling HCAL are used to measure the energies of photons, electrons, and hadrons within |\u03b7| < 3.0. The HCAL, when combined with the ECAL, measures jets with a resolution [21]. The three muon systems surrounding the solenoid cover a region |\u03b7| < 2.4 and are composed of drift tubes in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.2), cathode strip chambers in the endcaps (0.9 < |\u03b7| < 2.4), and resistive-plate chambers in both the barrel region and the endcaps (|\u03b7| < 1.6). Events are recorded based on a trigger decision using information from the CMS detector subsystems. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor further decreases the event rate from 100 kHz at L1 to roughly 300 Hz.",

In order to reduce the level of tt contamination, a veto is applied to events with one or more b-tagged jets. Heavy-flavour tagging is based on a tag algorithm [42] that exploits the long lifetime of b-quark hadrons. This algorithm calculates the signed impact parameter significance of all tracks in the jet that satisfy high-quality reconstruction and purity criteria, and orders the tracks by decreasing significance. The impact parameter significance is defined as the ratio of the impact parameter to its estimated uncertainty. For jets with two or more significant tracks, a high-efficiency b-quark discriminator is defined as the significance of the second most significant track. The size of the tt background is illustrated in Fig. 1, before and after the implementation of the b-jet veto, using the event selection described in Section 4. The expected contributions for the different processes in Fig. 1 are shown as a function of the jet multiplicity, along with the observed data. Differences in the tagging and mistagging rates between data and simulation are measured as a function of the jet p T in multijet and tt events [42], and are used to correct the tagging rates of the jets in simulation. For jet multiplicities of 1 to 6, the b-jet veto eliminates 44-84% of the predicted tt background, while eliminating 3-26% of the predicted W + jets signal.

The jet energy scale uncertainties are estimated by assigning a p T -and \u03b7-dependent uncertainty in jet energy corrections as discussed in Ref. [40], and by varying the jet p T by the magnitude of the uncertainty. The uncertainties in jet energy resolution are assessed by increasing the p T difference between the reconstructed and particle-level jets by an \u03b7-dependent value [40]. The jet energy uncertainties are determined by varying the p T of the jets in data rather than in simulation.",

For the diboson and single top-quark processes, uncertainties are calculated with mcfm [30][31][32][33] to be 4% and 6%, respectively. The uncertainty in the tt modelling is assessed by taking the difference between data and simulation in a control region with two or more b-tagged jets, and is estimated to be 5 to 12% for jet multiplicities of 2 to 6. The estimate of the multijet background has an uncertainty based on the limited number of events in the multijet sample and in the control regions where the multijet sample normalisation is calculated, and other systematic variations affecting the backgrounds in the multijet control regions introduce variations in the multijet normalisation and template shape. For the b-tagging algorithm used to veto events containing b jets, uncertainties in the data/simulation ratio of the b-tagging efficiencies are applied. For jets with p T > 30 GeV, these uncertainties range from 3.1 to 10.5%. An additional uncertainty is ascribed to the normalisation of the Wb content in the simulation by examining the agreement between data and simulation as a function of jet multiplicity in a control region defined by requiring exactly one b-tagged jet. An increase in the normalisation of the Wb process of 120% is considered, yielding an uncertainty in the measurement of 0.5 to 11% for jet multiplicities of 1 to 6. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.2% [3]. An uncertainty in the modelling of pileup in simulation is determined by varying the number of simulated pileup interactions by 5% to account for the uncertainty in the luminosity and the uncertainty in the total inelastic cross section [44], as determined by a comparison of the number of reconstructed vertices in Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events in data and simulation.",

Predictions from MadGraph + pythia and sherpa are normalised to the NNLO inclusive cross sections calculated with fewz [29]. The sherpa sample is a separate sample from that used for the evaluation of uncertainties in Section 7. The MadGraph and sherpa predictions provide leading-order (LO) matrix element (ME) calculations at each jet multiplicity, which are then combined into inclusive samples by matching the ME partons to particle jets. Parton showering (PS) and hadronisation of the MadGraph sample is performed with pythia 6.426 using the Z2 tune. The MadGraph + pythia calculation includes the production of up to four partons. The jet matching is performed following the k T -MLM prescription [47], where partons are clustered using the k T algorithm with a distance parameter of D = 1. The k T clustering thresholds are chosen to be 10 GeV and 20 GeV at the matrix-element and parton-shower level, respectively. The factorisation scale for each event is chosen to be the transverse mass computed after k T -clustering of the event down to a 2 \u2192 2 topology. The renormalisation scale for the event is the k T computed at each vertex splitting. The predictions from sherpa include the production of up to four partons.
