By contrast, for the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + , which proceeds via b \u2192 ccd, CP violation up to the percent level can be generated by interference between the suppressed tree-level diagram and additional gluonic penguin (loop) diagrams as shown in figure 1. Measurements of the branching fraction and CP asymmetry of the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + can provide information about the size of the penguin-diagram contributions relative to that of the tree diagram. This is critical for estimating the effects of penguin-diagram contributions in b \u2192 ccs decays on the determination of the CP violation parameter sin 2\u03b2 [2,3].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [12], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The efficiency depends on the momentum and pseudorapidity of the track and the track multiplicity in the event, and the calibration is therefore done in bins of those variables. The choice of binning necessarily involves a compromise between the granularity and statistical uncertainty of individual bins. Systematic uncertainties due to the limited number of kinematic bins are evaluated by doubling or halving the number of bins and recalculating the average efficiencies. The resulting deviations from the baseline results are taken as the systematic uncertainties: 0.39% and 0.46% for R \u03c0/K , and 0.06 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 0.01 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for \u2206A CP .",

Relative differences of 0.33% and 0.38% are found between the values of this ratio estimated with data and with simulation, which are taken as the corresponding systematic uncertainties on R \u03c0/K . Samples of D + decays are used to determine the difference between the kaon and pion detection efficiency asymmetries. However, the kinematic distributions of the pions and kaons in the D + samples may differ from those of the signal B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 h + samples, and the efficiency asymmetries may vary with the particle kinematics. To assess the scale of this effect, samples of D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + events are weighted such that the distribution of the momentum of the kaon matches that of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + , leading to a pion detection asymmetry of 0.12 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for both 7 and 8 T eV data. This is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The production asymmetry of B + mesons is a function of the B + kinematics. This dependence cancels in the observables considered, provided that B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays have the same kinematic distributions. Good agreement is found between the p T distributions of the decays B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + , but not for the rapidity distributions. The deviations of the B + production asymmetry with and without the weights that match the rapidity distribution in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + sample to that of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decay, are 0.02 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 0.04 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , which are taken as the systematic uncertainties on \u2206A CP .",

The sample analysed in ref. [9] is statistically correlated with that used in this analysis, but the correlation is only partial due to the use of different trigger requirements. The correlation coefficient between the statistical uncertainties of the two analyses is found to be \u22124.8%. The systematic uncertainty on A CP (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + ) is taken to be uncorrelated with that on the \u2206A CP measurement. Therefore the CP asymmetry in the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + is A CP (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + ) = \u2206A CP + A CP (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + ) = (1.91 \u00b1 0.89 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10 \u22122 . This is the most precise determination of A CP (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + ) to date, and it supersedes the previous LHCb result [8]. The R \u03c0/K and A CP (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + ) measurements can be combined with measurements of decay rates and CP asymmetries in other b \u2192 ccd decays, such as B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 , to understand the effect of loop contributions in b \u2192 ccs decays using SU(3) flavour symmetry [2,3].",
