Using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb \u22121 , collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, we measure for the first time the leptonic forward-backward asymmetry in dilepton final states and obtain A \u2113 FB = (5.8 \u00b1 5.1(stat) \u00b1 1.3(syst))%, corrected for detector acceptance. This is compared to the standard model prediction of A \u2113 FB (predicted) = (4.7 \u00b1 0.1)%. A deviation from the standard model prediction as previously seen in a D\u00d8 measurement based on the analysis of the \u2113+jets final state is not observed in these dilepton final states. The two results differ from each other by 1.4 standard deviations and are combined to obtain A \u2113 FB = (11.8 \u00b1 3.2)%. Furthermore, we present a first study of the top-quark polarization.",

At the Tevatron pp collider, with \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, tt production is dominated by quark-antiquark (qq) annihilation. At leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), production of tt pairs through qq annihilation is expected to be forward-backward (FB) symmetric in the center-of-mass frame. At next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD, interference leads to a small positive FB asymmetry, which implies that the top (antitop) quark is emitted with higher probability in the direction of the incoming quark (antiquark) than in the opposite direction. Top pair production through gluon-gluon fusion does not lead to such a FB asymmetry. SM predictions for the FB asymmetry can be modified by processes beyond the SM [1,2], such as contributions * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c UPIITA-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, d DESY, Hamburg, Germany, , e SLAC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, f University College London, London, UK, g Centro de Investigacion en Computacion -IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, h ECFM, Universidad Autonoma de Sinaloa, Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico and i Universidade Estadual Paulista, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. from hypothesized axigluons [3], Z \u2032 or W \u2032 bosons [4], and new scalars [5]. These sources of physics beyond the SM also modify observables sensitive to the top quark polarization [6].",

D0 finds a significant deviation from NLO QCD predictions of the order of three standard deviations (SD) [8]. The asymmetry in CDF data differs by more than three SD from the NLO QCD prediction at large values of the tt invariant mass (m t > 450 GeV) [7]. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have performed measurements of the difference in angular distributions between top quarks and antiquarks in the \u2113 + jets final state using asymmetries based on the top quark and antiquark rapidities [11,12] and pseudorapidities [12].

Here, we investigate such simpler leptonic asymmetries. To study the nature of a possible excess we present measurements of six different types of leptonic asymmetries based on the pseudorapidity and charge of the electrons or muons. Since these asymmetries are determined from the angles of the charged leptons, they are measured with high resolution. In addition, we combine the measurement of the leptonic FB asymmetry with the D0 measurement performed in \u2113 + jets final states [8]. It is important to perform measurements of both the tt FB asymmetry and the leptonic FB asymmetry, because their correlation can be related through top quark polarization to the underlying dynamics of top quark production [13]. For this reason, we also present a first study of the longitudinal polarization of the top quark in this Letter.",

The selection criteria and object identification of the dilepton (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5) decay channels follow those described in Ref. [15]. To enrich the sample in tt events, we require two isolated, oppositely charged leptons with transverse momentum p T > 15 GeV and at least two jets with p T > 20 GeV and detector pseudorapidity |\u03b7 det | < 2.5 [10]. For the e\u00b5 channel we require that H T (defined as the scalar sum of the larger of the two lepton-p T values and the scalar p T of each of the two most energetic jets) be greater than 110 GeV. For ee and \u00b5\u00b5 events we compute a likelihood for the significance of E / T [16], based on the probability distribution calculated from the value of E / T and the lepton and jet energy resolutions. We require this likelihood to exceed the value typical for background events. We find that only the \u00b5\u00b5 channel benefits from an additional restriction on E / T and, to increase signal purity, we therefore require E / T > 40 GeV for the \u00b5\u00b5 final state.
