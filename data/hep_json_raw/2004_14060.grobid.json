            "text": "A search for direct pair production of scalar partners of the top quark (top squarks or scalar third-generation up-type leptoquarks) in the all-hadronic tt plus missing transverse momentum final state is presented. The analysis of 139 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC yields no significant excess over the Standard Model background expectation. To interpret the results, a supersymmetric model is used where the top squark decays viat \u2192 t ( * )\u03c7 0 1 , with t ( * ) denoting an on-shell (off-shell) top quark and\u03c7 0 1 the lightest neutralino. Three specific event selections are optimised for the following scenarios. In the scenario where mt > m t + m\u03c70 1 , top squark masses are excluded in the range 400-1250 GeV for\u03c7 0 1 masses below 200 GeV at 95% confidence level. In the situation where mt \u223c m t +m\u03c70 1 , top squark masses in the range 300-630 GeV are excluded, while in the case where mt < m W + m b + m\u03c70 1 (with mt \u2212 m\u03c70 1 \u2265 5 GeV), considered for the first time in an ATLAS all-hadronic search, top squark masses in the range 300-660 GeV are excluded. Limits are also set for scalar third-generation up-type leptoquarks, excluding leptoquarks with masses below 1240 GeV when considering only leptoquark decays into a top quark and a neutrino.",

In these models, the supersymmetric partners are produced in pairs. At the LHC, top squarks are produced mostly via gluon-gluon fusion as well as quark-antiquark annihilation. In a simplified scenario where the first-and second-generation squarks and gluinos are decoupled, the cross section of direct top squark pair production is largely decoupled from the specific choice of SUSY model parameters except for the top squark mass. This production cross section falls steeply with increasing top squark mass, ranging from 10.0 \u00b1 6.7 pb for mt = 300 GeV to 0.89 \u00b1 0.13 fb for mt = 1300 GeV [18][19][20][21].",

In this search, enhanced sensitivity to two-body top squark decays, where mt \u2212m\u03c70 1 is greater than the top quark mass, m t , is achieved by the analysis of the full LHC Run 2 dataset and the exploitation of techniques designed to efficiently reconstruct top quarks that are Lorentz-boosted in the laboratory frame. Sensitivity to compressed scenarios, where mt \u2212 m\u03c70 1 \u223c m t , is extended compared with previous searches through the analysis of events in which high-transverse-momentum jets from initial-state radiation (ISR) boost the top squark system in the transverse plane. Finally, sensitivity to the four-body decay scenario where mt \u2212 m\u03c70 1 is less than the sum of the W boson mass, m W , and the b-quark mass, m b , is achieved by extending the identification efficiency for low-transverse-momentum b-hadron decays through the use of charged-particle tracking information, adding sensitivity to the all-hadronic channel in comparison with previous searches. All sensitivities are also increased thanks to global enhancements in detector performance achieved by the end of LHC Run 2, including more precise estimates of the statistical significance of missing transverse momentum in an event [38] and improved identification efficiencies for jets containing b-hadrons [39]. The interpretation of the results uses simplified models [40][41][42].",

            "text": "As has been demonstrated previously [23][24][25]43,44], top squark searches are sensitive to a variety of additional signal models such as top squarks originating from gluino decays [40][41][42], top squark decays via charged electroweak SUSY partners [40][41][42], mediator-based dark-matter models [45][46][47][48][49][50], scalar dark-energy models [51], and thirdgeneration scalar leptoquarks [52][53][54][55][56][57][58]. In this paper, the results are interpreted in models considering the pair production of up-type, third-generation scalar leptoquarks (LQ u 3 ), as shown in Fig. 1d, assuming that the LQ u 3 only interact with leptons and quarks from the same generation [59]. Similar LQ u 3 interpretations have been performed by both the ATLAS [44] and CMS [60] collaborations. The thirdgeneration leptoquark production cross section is identical to that of top squark production and the LQ u 3 \u2192 t\u03bd decay channel has the same experimental signature as heavy top squarks decaying into massless neutralinos, and thus additional sensitivity is achieved compared with previous LQ u 3 results.",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter covering the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and features three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each, providing coverage up to |\u03b7| = 2.7, as well as a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2 and 6 T\u2022m across most of the detector.",

These types of jets are referred to as 'jets'. Jet transverse momenta are further corrected to the corresponding particle-level jet p T , based on the simulation [104]. Remaining differences between data and simulated events are evaluated and corrected for using in situ techniques, which exploit the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon, Z boson, or multijet system in data. After these calibrations, all jets in the event with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 must satisfy a set of loose jet-quality requirements [105]. In the four-body analysis, the leading jet in p T must satisfy a set of tighter jet-quality requirements. These requirements are designed to reject jets originating from sporadic bursts of detector noise, large coherent noise or isolated pathological cells in the calorimeter system, hardware issues, beaminduced background or cosmic-ray muons [105]. If these jet requirements are not met, the event is discarded. All jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8 to be considered in this analysis. In addition, the 'medium' working point of the track-based jet vertex tagger [106,107] is required for jets with p T < 120 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, to reject jets that originate from pile-up interactions.",

The defining extrapolation for these control regions is over the number of leptons; three leptons (a combination of electrons and muons) from W and Z decays is required, compared with zero leptons in the signal region. Variables for which the signal and control region requirements differ are highlighted by a thick border around the cell that contains the requirement. Requirements are made on the following variables in SRA and SRB but have no equivalent requirement in the control region: statistical uncertainty in the CRs and the theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties (described in Sect. 7). However, the tt (tt and Z + jets) normalisation factors derived from the SRC (SRD) fit are lower than unity by one to two \u03c3 . Significant amounts of ISR radiation are required in SRC, SRD, and the associated control regions, unlike SRA-B and the associated control regions. The sim-ulated event yields in tt-enriched regions compare differently with data in SRA-B control regions and SRC-D control regions, overestimating the number of events in the latter, while fairly good agreement is observed in the former. A similar effect is observed in CRZAB and CRZD. These observations point to a mismodelling possibly related to the ISR system in tt and Z + jets events. The fitting procedure corrects for this mismodelling and is validated in the VRs discussed below. Validation regions are defined to check the validity of the normalisation factors in the signal regions and to check the ability of the MC to describe the shapes of the kinematic variables over which extrapolations are made in propagating background estimates from the control regions to the signal regions. The defining extrapolation from control to signal regions is in the lepton multiplicity, whereas the validation regions include only events with zero leptons, as in the signal regions. Validation regions are designed for the Z +jets background in SRA (VRZA) and SRB (VRZB-TTTW, VRZB-T0) and SRD (VRZD0-2), as well as for the tt background in SRA-B (VRTAB), SRC (VRTC), and SRD (VRTD1-2).

For track-jets with 5 < p T < 10 GeV, which may be selected in SRD0, no evaluation of the b-tagging performance in data is available, so the uncertainty is evaluated by comparing the b-tagging performance observed in Z \u2192 + \u2212 events generated with Sherpa and MadGraph interfaced with Pythia 8.2, resulting in an uncertainty of 7% in SRD0. The difference between the predictions of these two generators was found to always be larger than the difference between the predictions from extrapolation from the neighbouring bins, hence assigning the uncertainty based on the generator comparison is assumed to be conservative.",

A new fit configuration is defined (referred to as an exclusion fit) for each signal region category (SRA-B, SRC or SRD), where the Poisson probability density functions describing the observed and expected numbers of events in all relevant signal region bins are included in the likelihood function, and the signal-strength parameter, defined for positive values, is free-floating in the fit. Signal contamination in the CRs is taken into account. Limits are derived using the CL s prescription and calculated from asymptotic formulae [136]. The nominal event yield in each set of SRs is set using the background-level estimates obtained from a backgroundonly fit to both the CRs and the SRs to determine the expected limits, while a coloured band that represents the \u00b11\u03c3 of the total uncertainty (\u03c3 exp ) is also evaluated. The observed event yields and the same background estimates are used to determine the observed limits for each set of SRs (SRA-B, SRC and SRD); these are evaluated for the nominal signal cross sections as well as for \u00b11\u03c3 theory uncertainties in those cross sections, denoted by \u03c3 SUSY theory . Figure 13 shows the observed and expected exclusion contours at 95% CL as a function of (a) the\u03c7     the expected exclusion contour are observed in this region and were traced back to the fixed R ISR -binning adopted in SRC. Since the binning of R ISR is fixed and does not depend on the signal considered, for some signals the peak is located at the boundary between two bins and therefore leads to a global lower signal over background ratio across all SRC bins. Finally, limits are set by the SRD fit in the case where mt \u2212 m\u03c70 for mt < 490 GeV. This is the first time that an ATLAS all-hadronic search reaches exclusion sensitivity in the fourbody region. This is due to the newly introduced and dedicated SRD, which takes advantage of track-jet b-tagging to discriminate between signal and background. The exclusion limits shown in Fig.13 are derived for unpolarised top squarks. 6 The exclusion limit stays within \u00b125 GeV of top squark mass when varying the top squark polarisation, which is within the \u03c3 SUSY theory uncertainty band; hadronic final states are less sensitive to polarisation effects than final states with one or more leptons. The SRA-B exclusion fit was repeated considering the analysis sensitivity to the production of up-type, thirdgeneration scalar leptoquarks. The results are shown in Fig.14a as a function of the leptoquark branching ratio to charged leptons, B LQ u 3 \u2192 b\u03c4 in this scenario, vs the leptoquark mass.

The third column (S 95 exp ) shows the 95% CL upper limit on the number of signal events, given the expected number (and \u00b11\u03c3 excursions on the expectation) of background events. The last two columns indicate the CL B value, i.e. the confidence level observed for the background-only hypothesis, the discovery p-value ( p(s = 0)), and the significance (Z). In cases where the observed data yields are less than the total expected background yields, the p-value is truncated to 0.5   Fig.14b. The difference in exclusion reach at B LQ u 3 \u2192 b\u03c4 = 0 between the leptoquark and top squark interpretations comes from the fact that top squark samples were produced at LO in QCD while the leptoquark samples were produced at NLO, which changes the kinematics slightly. This difference, however, is covered by the signal acceptance uncertainty (12% in SRA-B).",

In SRB, an additional requirement of m b,max T > 200 GeV is made, where m b,max T is analogous to m b,min T except that the transverse mass is computed with the b-tagged jet that has the largest \u03c6 relative to the p miss T direction. This requirement is a more stringent version of m b,min T , requiring that the leading two b-tagged jets are not near the p miss T . Finally, to allow the statistical combination of SRA and SRB, SRA is required to have the m T2,\u03c7 2 variable greater than 450 GeV, while SRB is required to have m T2,\u03c7 2 < 450 GeV. The m T2,\u03c7 2 variable is based on m T2 [115,116] and is constructed from the direction and magnitude of p miss T and the direction of each of the top candidates, reconstructed using a \u03c7 2 -like method with R = 0.4 jets as inputs. The minimisation for finding the top candidates used in m T2,\u03c7 2 is performed in terms of a \u03c7 2 -like penalty function, \u03c7 2 = (m cand \u2212 m true ) 2 /m true , where m cand is the top quark or W boson candidate mass and m true is set to 80.4 GeV for W boson candidates and 173.2 GeV for top quark candidates. 5 Initially, single or pairs of R = 0.4 jets, whichever configuration results in a mass closest to m W , form W boson candidates, which are then combined with additional b-jets in the event to construct top quark candidates. When calculating m T2,\u03c7 2 the momenta of top quark candidates selected by the \u03c7 2 method are used, while the masses of the top quarks are set to 173.2 GeV and the invisible particles are assumed to be massless.",

Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are derived as a function of mt and m\u03c70 resulting in the exclusion of top squark masses that extend up to 1.25 TeV for\u03c7 0 1 masses below 200 GeV. In the case where mt \u223c m t + m\u03c70 top squark masses in the range 300\u2212630 GeV are excluded, while in the scenario where mt < m W + m b + m\u03c70",
