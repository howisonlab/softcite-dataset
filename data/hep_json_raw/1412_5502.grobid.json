Charge conjugate states are implied throughout the document. This analysis exploits the large production of charm mesons via the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 cc and identifies D 0 from the decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + . The momentum of the signal D 0 is derived from all particles reconstructed in the event. A very similar method was successfully employed in the BABAR analysis of the Cabibbo-favored D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e [1] decay. The validity of this procedure is examined and the associated systematic uncertainties reduced by analyzing in parallel the two-body decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . From the ratio of branching fractions, R D = B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e )/B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ), we derive the absolute value of the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e branching fraction, using the world average for the branching fraction for the normalization, B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ).",

Charged hadron identification is performed combining the measured ionization losses in the SVT and in the DCH with the information from the Cherenkov detector (DIRC).

To obtain the true q 2 distribution for signal events, the background-subtracted measured distribution is unfolded to correct for selection efficiency and resolution effects. We adopt the procedure employed in the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e analysis [1], and use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [35] of the resolution matrix, keeping seven significant singular values. Table II lists the number of selected events, the estimated total background, and the unfolded signal event yields. Systematic uncertainties in the total branching fraction and differential decay rates are expected to originate from imperfect simulation of c quark fragmentation and of the detector response, from uncertainties in the background composition and the size of their contributions to the selected sample, and from the uncertainty in the modeling of the signal decay. We study the origin and size of various systematic effects, correct the MC simulation, if possible, and assess the impact of the uncertainty in the correction of the signal distributions. Many of these studies make use of standard BABAR measurements of detection efficiencies, others rely on data control samples, and the sample of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays.

            "text": "In general terms, the hadronic form factor can be expressed as an infinite sum of pole contributions [3,14]. At large q 2 , the effective three-pole ansatz with the truncation of the series to three poles, of which the third one is an effective pole, describes the measurements well, satisfying also the constraints from expectations for contributions of the first two poles. This ansatz has been used to analyze B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays and to provide a parameterization for f \u03c0 +,B (q 2 ). Using the fitted effective threepole ansatz for f \u03c0 +,D (q 2 ) and assuming that the ratio R BD of the B and D form factors does not depend on the pion energy, the value |V ub | = (3.65 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b1 0.40) \u00d7 10 \u22123 is obtained. The dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty originates from R BD . In another approach, we have used the effective three-pole ansatz to fit the measured partial branching fractions for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays with constraints on the value of the B * pole contribution and the ratio of the residues at the B * \u2032 1 and B * poles, taken to be equal to the corresponding ratio for charmed mesons [3,14]. We obtain |V ub | = (2.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where the dominant systematic uncertainty originates from the residue at the B * pole.",
