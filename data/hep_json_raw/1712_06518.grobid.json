For the interpretation of the results in the context of models with heavy vector triplets (HVT), a simplified model [25,26], based on a phenomenological Lagrangian is used as a benchmark. This model incorporates an SU(2) L triplet of heavy vector bosons, which allows the results to be interpreted in a large class of models. The new heavy vector bosons, W and Z , collectively denoted by V , couple to the Higgs and gauge bosons via a combination of parameters g V c H and to the fermions via the combination (g 2 /g V ) c F , where g is the SU(2) L gauge coupling. The parameter g V represents the strength of the new vector-boson interaction, and c H and c F represent corrections to the coupling strength specific to Higgs bosons and fermions, respectively. Two benchmark models are used in this analysis. In the first model, referred to as Model A, the branching fractions to fermions and gauge bosons are comparable, as in some models with an extended gauge symmetry [27]. For Model B, fermionic couplings are suppressed, as in strong dynamical models such as the minimal composite Higgs model [28]. At low resonance masses and large g V couplings, the HVT models fail to reproduce the SM parameters, thus this search focuses on high masses, from 500 GeV up to 5 TeV.",

The exclusion limits are evaluated for the Type I, Type II, Lepton-specific, and Flipped 2HDMs. These differ with respect to which doublets couple to the up-type and down-type quarks as well as to the charged leptons [16]. Both the production via gluon-gluon fusion and the production with associated b-quarks (bbA) are considered in this search. The A \u2192 Zh decay mode is mostly relevant below the tt production threshold and the cross-section falls steeply with increasing A boson mass.

The event generation utilises Comix [61] and OpenLoops [62], for the matrix element calculation, matched to the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [63]. The matrix elements were calculated for up to two additional partons at NLO and for three and four partons at LO in QCD. The cross-sections for W /Z+jets were calculated at NNLO accuracy [64]. The tt process was simulated with Powheg-Box v2 [65][66][67] interfaced to Pythia 6.428 [68]. The CT10 PDF set [48] was used in the calculation of the matrix elements, while the parton shower used the Perugia 2012 tune [69] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [70]. The cross-section was calculated at NNLO accuracy including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms with Top++2.0 [71][72][73][74][75][76][77]. The predicted transverse momentum spectra of top quarks and the tt system were reweighted to the corresponding NNLO parton-level spectra [78]. The production of single top quarks (t-channel, s-channel, and W t) was simulated using the Powheg-Box event generator with the CT10 PDF set. The shower and hadronisation was simulated using the same event generator and set-up as for the tt process. The cross-section for the t-and s-channel single-top-quark production was calculated at NLO accuracy using Hathor v2.1 [79,80], while for the W t process an approximate NNLO calculation was used [81]. The top mass is set fixed to 172.5 GeV in the tt and single-top-quark samples.",

When the Higgs boson has relatively low p T , the b-quarks from its decay can be reconstructed as two small-R jets. As the momentum of the Higgs boson increases, the two b-quarks become more collimated and a selection using a single large-R jet becomes more efficient. Two different methods are used for the reconstruction of the Higgs boson candidate: a \"resolved\" category in which two small-R jets are used to build the Higgs boson candidate, and a \"merged\" category where the highest-p T (\"leading\") large-R jet is selected as the Higgs boson candidate.",

The uncertainties in the small-R jet energy scale have contributions from in situ calibration studies, from the dependency on the pile-up activity and on the flavour composition of jets [103,112]. The small-R jet uncertainties are propagated to the E miss T measurement. The uncertainty in the scale and resolution of large-R jet energy and mass is estimated by comparing the ratio of calorimeter-based to track-based measurements in dijet data and simulation [100,101]. The flavour tagging efficiency and its uncertainty for b-jets and c-jets is estimated in tt and W + c-jet events, respectively, while the light-jet misidentification rate and uncertainty is determined using dijet events [106,107,113,114]. Other experimental systematic uncertainties with a smaller impact are those in the lepton energy and momentum scales, in lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency, and in the efficiency of the triggers. Finally, a global normalisation uncertainty of 3.2% is assigned due to the luminosity measurement from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref.

The admixture of gluon-gluon fusion and b-quark associated production, and the variation of the A and h boson widths and branching fractions are taken into account according to the predictions of the different models. In this interpretation, the m T,V h and m V h distributions of the simulated signal events are smeared according to a Breit-Wigner function with a width predicted by the parameters of the model. This procedure has been verified to produce the same line-shape as the one including non-resonant and interference effects for widths \u0393 A /m A < 10%. Figure 7 shows the excluded parameter space for a resonance mass of m A = 300 GeV in four 2HDM types: I, II, Lepton-Specific, and Flipped. Greater sensitivity is observed at high tan(\u03b2) for the Type-II and Flipped models, due to an increased cross-section for b-quark associated production. The narrow regions with no exclusion power in Type-I and Type-II at low tan(\u03b2) that are far from cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0 are caused by the vanishing branching fraction of h \u2192 bb. Figure 8 shows the parameter exclusion for the four models in the tan(\u03b2)-m A plane for cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0.1. For the interpretation in Type-II and Flipped 2HDMs, the b-quark associated production is included in addition to the gluon-gluon fusion production. The shape of the expected exclusions is determined by the interplay of the expected crosssection limit, which decreases as a function of m A , and the signal production cross-section times the A \u2192 Zh branching fraction at a given m A and tan(\u03b2). This branching fraction decreases significantly at m A = 350 GeV due to the opening of the A \u2192 tt channel, but increases again at higher m A , maintaining similar sensitivity into this m A region. The variable tan(\u03b2) controls the admixture of the gluon-gluon fusion and b-quark associated production thereby affecting the rate at which the signal cross-section falls as a function of m A , which leads to a varying sensitivity as a function of tan(\u03b2). The excesses or deficits in the data visible in figure 6 are also reflected in figure 8.  Table 5. The predicted and observed event yields in the signal regions defined in the text. The yields in the 1 and 2 b-tag regions correspond to the HVT fit for a signal of mass 1.5 TeV. In the 3+ b-tag and 1 and 2 b-tag with additional b-tags regions, the yields are from the fit using the A boson produced in association with b-quarks as signal with a mass of 1.5 TeV. The quoted uncertainties are the statistical and systematic uncertainties combined in quadrature after the fit. The uncertainties in the individual background predictions are larger than the total background uncertainty due to correlations in the normalisation parameters in the fit. Figure 2. Event distributions of m T,V h for the 0-lepton channel, and m V h for the 1-lepton and 2-lepton channels in the resolved categories. The quantity on the vertical axis is the number of data events divided by the bin width in GeV. The background prediction is shown after a backgroundonly maximum-likelihood fit to the data. The signal for the benchmark HVT Model A with m V = 1.5 TeV is normalised to 10 times the theoretical cross-section. The background uncertainty band shown includes both the statistical and systematic uncertainties after the fit added in quadrature.
