The five quarkonium states are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel, for dimuon rapidity |y| < 1.2. The double-differential cross sections for each state are measured as a function of y and transverse momentum, and compared to theoretical expectations. In addition, ratios are presented of cross sections for prompt \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8, \u03d2(2S) to \u03d2(1S), and \u03d2(3S) to \u03d2(1S) production.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of heavy-quark bound states, quarkonium production in hadronic collisions has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies. A well established theoretical framework to describe quarkonium production is nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) [1][2][3], an effective theory that assumes that the mechanism can be factorized in two steps. In the first step, a heavy quark-antiquark pair is produced in a given spin and orbital angular momentum state, either in a color-singlet or color-octet configuration. The corresponding parton-level cross sections, usually called short-distance coefficients (SDCs), are functions of the kinematics of the state and can be calculated perturbatively, presently up to next-to-leading order (NLO) [4][5][6][7]. In the second step, the quark-antiquark pairs bind into the final quarkonium states through a nonperturbative hadronization process, with transition probabilities determined by process-independent longdistance matrix elements (LDMEs). Unlike the SDCs, the LDMEs are presently not calculable and must be obtained through fits to experimental data [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Until recently, for directly produced S-wave quarkonia, the color-octet 3 S 1 term was thought to dominate, which would result in a strong transverse polarization of the mesons relative to their direction of motion (helicity frame) at large transverse momentum, p T .",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid [37]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [38]. The data were collected using a multilevel trigger system [39]. The first level (L1), made of custom hardware processors providing coarse momentum information, requires two muons within the range |\u03b7| < 1.6 without requesting an explicit p T threshold on the individual muons. Second (L2) and third (L3) levels, collectively known as the HLT (High-Level Trigger), are implemented in software. At these levels, the muon selection is refined, then opposite-charge muon candidates are paired and required to have an invariant mass in the regions 2.9-3.3, 3.35-4.05, or 8.5-11 GeV for the J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S), and \u03d2(nS), respectively. The dimuon p T is required to be above 9.9 GeV for the J/\u03c8 and above 7.9 GeV for the remaining states. For all five states, the dimuon rapidity is restricted to |y| < 1.25. A fit of the positions and momenta of the two muon candidates to a common vertex is performed, and the fit \u03c7 2 probability is required to be above 0.5%. The sample collected with these triggers has a total integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 for the J/\u03c8 and 2.7 fb \u22121 for the other mesons. The lower value for the J/\u03c8 is the consequence of the trigger prescaling that was applied to limit the rate during part of the data taking, when the instantaneous luminosity increased.",

The quarkonium states are generated with a flat y distribution and a realistic p T distribution derived from data [25,26], covering the analysis phase space. The pythia 8.205 [40] Monte Carlo event generator is used to produce an unpolarized dimuon decay (corresponding to a flat dimuon angular distribution), also accounting for final-state photon radiation. The simulated events include multiple proton-proton interactions in the same or nearby beam crossings (pileup), with the distribution matching that observed in data, with an average of about 11 collisions per bunch crossing. The acceptance for events in a given (p T , |y|) range is defined as the ratio of the number of generated events that pass the kinematic selection criteria described above to the total number of simulated events in that p T and |y| range. The acceptance depends on the quarkonium polarization. It is derived for the unpolarized scenario, which is compatible with experimental measurements within uncertainties. We also calculate multiplicative correction factors that allow, from the unpolarized case, to infer the acceptance that corresponds to three different values of the polar anisotropy parameter, \u03bb HX \u03b8 , in the helicity frame: \u22121 (fully longitudinal), +1 (fully transverse), and k, with k reflecting the CMS measured value of \u03bb HX \u03b8 for each quarkonium state [31,32], also used in Refs. [26,27]. The multiplicative factors to convert the cross sections calculated using the unpolarized scenario to the ones calculated employing one of the polarization scenarios described above are provided.

Uncertainties in the estimation of the yields are evaluated by changing the signal and background models used in the maximum-likelihood fits. To assess the systematic uncertainty in the modeling of the signal invariant mass distribution of each state, the n and \u03b1 parameters of the CB function are varied by up to \u00b15 standard deviations, one at a time, while the mean, which is constrained in the nominal fit, is allowed to float. The half-differences between the largest resulting deviations of the signal yields measured in the fit from the nominal yields are added in quadrature to obtain an uncertainty in the modeling of the signal. The systematic uncertainty originating from a possibly imperfect description of the background is evaluated by changing the background model from an exponential to a linear function. The observed differences from the nominal signal yields are taken as a systematic uncertainty. The total uncertainty in the determination of the yields is obtained as the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties in signal and background, and is about 2.0% for all quarkonium states.",

We assess the uncertainty originating from the choice of the primary vertex by using an alternative to the average position of the luminous region, the position of the collision vertex closest to the dimuon vertex extrapolated towards the beam line. The systematic uncertainty related to the description of the background is evaluated by measuring the difference between the prompt fractions using the nominal fit and a fit modeling the background by the sum of four exponential functions and a simplified resolution function composed of only one single Gaussian function. To study the impact of imperfect modeling of the resolution function, the scale parameters of the Gaussian functions that had Gaussian constraints in the nominal fit are varied by \u00b11 standard deviation. Similarly, we assess the impact of modeling the nonprompt signal by fixing the parameterization of the exponential decay function. The systematic uncertainty stemming from the choice of the primary vertex is added in quadrature with the uncertainty derived from the fit strategy. The latter is calculated as half of the difference between the maximum deviations observed from the nominal fit when the above variations are applied one by one. The total systematic uncertainty in the determination of the nonprompt yield is less than 3% in almost all the (p T , y) bins for the J/\u03c8 meson, without a dominant contribution from any one of the sources described above. The largest systematic uncertainty in the \u03c8(2S) measurements can reach a maximum of 16%, mostly owing to the uncertainty in the modeling of the background decay length distribution. The effect of pileup on the analysis results has been studied using both data and simulation, and found to be negligible.",

Moreover, we assign the fractional difference in the \u03c1 factor obtained from data and simulation as a systematic uncertainty. The difference is in the range 2-5% up to 60 GeV and increases slowly for higher p T , reaching a value of up to 15%, in the worst case.

Taking advantage of the larger yields in the integrated-rapidity range, an additional p T bin was added for each state. The systematic uncertainty in the yields for this bin was evaluated as described above for the other bins, while for other uncertainties the same value as in the neighboring lower-p T bin was used. It was verified that systematic uncertainties extrapolated to the additional p T bin have either negligible p T dependence in that region or are negligibly small compared to other systematic or statistical uncertainties. The correlation factors are found to be approximately 5%, causing no significant effect on the final systematic uncertainty. The same single-muon efficiencies are used for all the measured cross sections, therefore their uncertainties are treated as correlated in all the ratios. The systematic uncertainties in the ratios are determined by consistently varying the efficiencies in the numerator and the denominator by their uncertainties and recalculating the ratios. The resulting effect is less than 0.4%. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is fully correlated, and is not included in the ratios.
