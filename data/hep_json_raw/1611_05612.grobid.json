            "text": "Interest in pion inelastic interactions has increased in recent years due to the use of nuclear targets in GeV-scale neutrino experiments. Neutrinos are primarily detected via charged-current quasi-elastic interactions (\u03bd \u00b5 + n \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 + p) with target atomic nuclei. The neutrino-induced single pion production processes also contribute to the cross section in this energy range. The energy of the neutrino is fundamental to probing the oscillation phenomena and is inferred from the measured kinematics of the outgoing lepton. If the pion is produced but not detected due to final-state interactions (FSI) within the target nucleus or secondary interactions (SI) elsewhere in the detectors, the inferred neutrino energy will be biased.",

            "text": "FSI and SI are leading contributors to systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation and cross section experiments. Their impact is typically evaluated using predictions based on models implemented in Monte Carlo neutrino event generators such as Neut [14] and NuWro [15] for FSI, or detector simulation toolkits such as Geant4 [16] and Fluka [17,18] for SI. Some of these generators use similar implementations of semi-classical cascade models in which the pion is propagated within the nucleus and its fate is calculated following theoretical optical models in which the pion-nucleus scattering is represented as a wave in a complex potential. The real part of the potential is responsible for elastic scattering while the imaginary part gives the contributions from inelastic channels [19,20]. Precise tuning of the models is achieved through the empirical scaling of the theoretical microscopic interaction rates, relying entirely on the available \u03c0 \u00b1 -A scattering data. Other important scenarios in which \u03c0 \u00b1 -A interactions are relevant for neutrino physics are: i) the enhancement of the neutral-current \u03c0 0 background in neutrino oscillation appearance experiments, and, ii) pion reconstruction capabilities in water Cherenkov detectors via the explicit identification of their hadronic interactions.",

Its outer dimensions were 5\u00d76 mm 2 , while the sensitive area was 1.3\u00d71.3 mm 2 containing 667 avalanche photo-diode pixels. The small size allowed for using one MPPC per bar, eliminating the possibility of crosstalk at the sensor. A custom connector was developed to achieve good optical coupling. The XY modules were held rigidly in place inside an aluminum light-tight box. The read out electronics were mounted on the outer sides of the box to separate elements generating heat and to prevent temperature induced effects on the MPPCs.",

A comparison of this data and predictions from the Neut (v5.3.5) cascade model [14], the Geant4 (v9.04.04) Bertini cascade model [16], and the Fluka cascade model [17,18] is shown in Fig. 5. The discrepancy among models is largest in the forward region, where CEMBALOS is most sensitive. In particular, the Geant4 Bertini Cascade model used by our simulation shows the largest disagreement with data [6]. The modeling of the multiplicity and kinematics for nucleons ejected following an ABS or CX interaction show even larger discrepancies among models. The mechanisms for these processes are further complicated by the possibility of FSI of the nucleons before they exit the nucleus. Data on light nuclei that would help in the understanding and tuning of these processes are very scarce. Neut uses nucleon multiplicities published by [25] of \u03c3 ABS on N and Ar targets, but it is unclear what other models use.",

A control sample of protons stopping in the first two XY modules of CEMBALOS was used to estimate the accuracy of the charge simulation for higher energy depositions. It was obtained by using dQ/dx information from PIA\u03bdO to select \"proton-like\" tracks and requiring all CEMBALOS hits to be in the first two XY modules. Fig. 12 shows the charge deposition distribution in the first layer of CEM-BALOS for this sample in data and MC.

A random Gaussian smear-ing with a 20% width was applied to the charge deposited by each hit in every event for 1000 toy MC experiments to determine what fraction of the time signal events were mis-reconstructed as background and vice versa.

Fig. 13 shows the hit inefficiency, defined as the ratio of missing hits over the total number of hits expected, for data and MC in the 237.2 MeV/c setting as a function of the CEMBALOS reconstructed polar angle. The hit inefficiency integrated over all angles is 1.33% and 1.16% for data and MC respectively. The effect on the measured cross section is estimated by randomly deleting CEMBALOS hits in 1000 MC toy experiments with a probability given by the difference of the integrated hit inefficiencies for data and MC, affecting both the hit multiplicity and total charge deposited.",
