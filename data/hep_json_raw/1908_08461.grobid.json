Events with a photon, an electron or muon, a b-tagged jet, and missing transverse momentum are selected. A neural network based on kinematic variables differentiates between events from signal and background processes. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are set on the strength of the tq\u03b3 coupling in an effective field theory. These are also interpreted as 95% CL upper limits on the cross section for FCNC t\u03b3 production via a left-handed (right-handed) tu\u03b3 coupling of 36 fb (78 fb) and on the branching ratio for t \u2192 \u03b3 u of 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). In addition, they are interpreted as 95% CL upper limits on the cross section for FCNC t\u03b3 production via a left-handed (right-handed) tc\u03b3 coupling of 40 fb (33 fb) and on the branching ratio for t \u2192 \u03b3 c of 22 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (18 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ).",

Several extensions to the SM predict processes involving FCNCs. In particular, some of these models predict the branching ratios of top-quark decays via FCNC to be significantly larger [2] than those predicted by the SM, which are of the order of 10 \u221214 [2]. Examples are R-parity-violating supersymmetric models [3] and models with two Higgs doublets [4]. Such models would allow the production of top quarks via FCNCs at a measurable rate.",

This analysis is most sensitive to the production of a single top quark plus a photon, but also considers the decay of a pair-produced top quark into an up or charm quark (q) plus a photon. Tree-level Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Fig. 1, where in both cases, exactly one top quark decays via the SM-favoured tW b coupling. Compared to the SM production of a top quark and a photon, the FCNC processes result in higher photon transverse momenta on average. E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch. FCNC contributions to the decay mode (t \u2192 q\u03b3 ) and the production mode (q \u2192 t\u03b3 ) can be expressed in terms of effective coupling parameters but also in terms of branching ratios and cross sections [5,6]. In the former case and following the notation in Ref. [7], the corresponding operators are O (ij) uB and O (ij) uW , where i = j are indices for the quark generation. In general, lefthanded (LH) and right-handed (RH) couplings could exist, which result in different kinematic properties of the top-quark decay products, such as the transverse momentum of the charged lepton in semileptonic top-quark decays. The most stringent limits to date are limits on branching ratios of B(t \u2192 u \u03b3 ) < 1.3 \u2022 10 \u22124 and B(t \u2192 c \u03b3 ) < 1.7 \u2022 10 \u22123 set by the CMS Collaboration, assuming equal left-and right-handed couplings [8].",

Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The MS surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most nearly 100 kHz.

A signal region (SR) is defined by loose requirements on the kinematic properties of the final-state objects, giving rise to a large acceptance for signal events in the production mode. With this selection, the search is most sensitive to FCNCs in this mode, but the decay mode is included in the analysis. The main background contribution stems from electrons misidentified as photons, primarily in top-quark-anti-top-quark events (tt). These contributions and contributions from hadrons misidentified as photons (both labelled \"fakes\" in the following) are modelled by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and scaled to datadriven estimates. Photons produced in association with a leptonically decaying W or Z boson are estimated in control regions (CRs) which do not overlap with the SR but are kinematically similar to it. The predictions for other small prompt-photon background processes are taken from MC simulation and include tt\u03b3 production, single-top quark production in association with a photon and the production of two massive gauge bosons with a photon. As the latter two processes result in a small contribution to the total background prediction, it is sufficient that in these processes prompt photons are generated by the parton-shower program.

SFs are also applied for the JVT requirement and for the b-tagging efficiencies for jets that originate The selected events have exactly one electron or muon, exactly one photon, exactly one b-tagged jet and no further jets, and E miss T > 30 GeV. This selection defines the SR with signal efficiencies 3 for the production mode of 3.03% (2.45%) for the LH (RH) tu\u03b3 coupling and of 3.79% (3.14%) for the LH (RH) tc\u03b3 coupling. These efficiencies are defined with respect to signal events that include a leptonic decay of the W boson, i.e. a decay with an electron, muon or tau lepton. The efficiencies for the couplings that involve a c-quark are larger than those that involve a u-quark because of the difference in the kinematics that arises from the difference between the u-and c-quark PDFs. The difference between the efficiencies for the LH and the RH couplings is due to the kinematic distributions of the W boson's decay products, which differ depending on the handedness of the top quark. The efficiencies for the decay mode are 0.45% and 0.51% for the tu\u03b3 and the tc\u03b3 coupling, respectively, and are lower due to the requirement of not more than one jet in the final state, i.e. this analysis is optimised for the production mode. The absolute statistical uncertainties in the efficiencies are 0.03% or smaller. In the SR, 9557 data events are selected. The ratio of production-mode to decay-mode event yields is 4.2 (5.3) for the LH (RH) tu\u03b3 coupling and it is 0.86 (0.68) for the LH (RH) tc\u03b3 coupling, i.e. in the case of tu\u03b3 coupling, the dominant signal process is indeed the production mode. However, in the case of the tc\u03b3 coupling, the decay mode also plays an important role, because the production mode is suppressed by the c-quark PDF.",

No cross-section uncertainty is considered for W +\u03b3 +jets and Z +\u03b3 +jets production, because their normalisations are determined in the fit. Uncertainties due to the modelling of the signal are estimated by considering variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales by factors of 2 and 0.5, but normalising the signal to the nominal cross section. In each bin of a distribution, the largest deviation among all variations is considered as an uncertainty (envelope). In addition, uncertainties due to the PDFs are estimated by following the PDF4LHC prescription for Run 2 [66].",

From the 95% confidence level (CL) limits on the signal contribution, derived using the C L s method [74], the corresponding limits on the effective coupling parameters are calculated, and from these the limits on the production cross section and branching ratios are calculated. The background contributions from photons produced in association with a leptonically decaying W or Z boson are scaled by normalisation factors estimated to be 1.25 \u00b1 0.09 and 1.12 \u00b1 0.12, respectively, from the fit for the LH tu\u03b3 coupling. The normalisation values determined in the fits for the other couplings are similar. The observed and expected 95% CL limits on the effective coupling strengths, the production cross section and the branching ratio are summarised in Table 2 for different vertices and couplings. The sources of systematic uncertainty with the largest impact on the estimated signal contribution depend on the coupling studied. Among them are the jet energy resolution, the reweighting of the photon p T , the factorisation and renormalisation scales, the choice of generator for the simulation of the tt and singletop processes, and the uncertainties due to the limited number of Monte Carlo events. The resulting limits on the strength of the effective operators are complementary to current limits on the single operators from a search for an FCNC tq Z coupling [75].",

Post-fit distributions of a background-only fit to the SR and the CRs of the NN output in the SR (top) and the W +\u03b3 +jet CR (bottom left) and of the p T -distribution of the Z +\u03b3 CR (bottom right). The last bin of the distribution in the Z +\u03b3 CR contains the overflow. In addition, in the SR and in the W +\u03b3 +jet CR, the expected signal is overlaid for an effective coupling strength corresponding to the observed limit multiplied by a factor of ten. In the Z +\u03b3 CR, the expected signal is not shown, because it is negligible.",

The contribution from events with electrons or hadrons that are misidentified as photons is estimated using data, and the two main background processes with a prompt photon are estimated in control regions. A neural network is used to distinguish the signal and background events, and the data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. Limits are set on the strength of effective operators that introduce a left-or right-handed flavour-changing tq\u03b3 coupling with an up-type quark q, on the production cross section for FCNC t\u03b3 production, and on the branching ratio t \u2192 \u03b3 q. The limits on the branching ratio and on the t\u03b3 production cross section are the most stringent to date. The resulting limits on the strength of the effective operators are the most stringent limits obtained in searches for events with a tq\u03b3 vertex.Cacciari, G.P. Salam, G.
