The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 collected with the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, and contains a total of 41 560 selected B 0 andB 0 decays. The analysis of the time evolution of these decays yields S \u00bc 0.731 AE 0.035\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.020\u00f0syst\u00de and C \u00bc \u22120.038 AE 0.032\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.005\u00f0syst\u00de. In the standard model, S equals sin\u00f02\u03b2\u00de to a good level of precision. The values are consistent with the current world averages and with the standard model expectations.",

Since then, measurements of CP violation in this decay mode have reached a precision at the level of 10 \u22122 [3,4]. Thus, these measurements play an important role in constraining and testing the quark-flavor sector of the standard model [5,6], which relates CP-violating observables to a single irreducible phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [7,8]. As the J=\u03c8K 0 S final state is common to both the B 0 and th\u0113 B 0 meson decays, the interference between the amplitudes for the direct decay and for the decay after B 0 -B 0 oscillation results in a decay-time dependent CP asymmetry between the time-dependent decay rates of B 0 andB 0 mesons A\u00f0t\u00de \u2261 \u0393\u00f0B 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8K 0 S \u00de \u2212 \u0393\u00f0B 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8K 0 S \u00de \u0393\u00f0B 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8K 0 S \u00de \u00fe \u0393\u00f0B 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8K",

Pions are identified using information from the particle identification detectors, and the difference between the invariant mass of the B and the B\u03c0 AE pair is required to be less than 1.2 GeV=c 2 . Additionally, the flight directions of the pion and the B candidate must be compatible. If multiple pion candidates pass the selection, the one with the highest transverse momentum is used.

Significant average deviations of the fit results from the input values are used as estimates of systematic uncertainties. The largest systematic uncertainty on S, AE0.018, accounts for possible tag asymmetries in the background; for C the largest uncertainty, AE0.0034, results from the systematic uncertainty on \u0394m. Systematic uncertainties on the flavor tagging calibration account for the second largest systematic uncertainty on S, AE0.006, and on C, AE0.0024.

This measurement supersedes the previous LHCb result obtained with 1.0 fb \u22121 [13], and represents the most precise timedependent CP violation measurement at a hadron collider to date. Furthermore, the result has a similar precision to, and is in good agreement with, previous measurements performed at the Belle and BABAR experiments at the KEKB and PEP-II colliders [3,4]. This result is in excellent agreement with the expectations from other CKM related measurements and, after averaging with other results, improves the consistency of the CKM sector of the standard model.",
