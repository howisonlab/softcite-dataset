            "text": "The B c meson family is unique in the Standard Model as its states contain two different heavy-flavour quarks, ab and a c quark. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that theb and c quarks are tightly bound in a compact system, with a rich spectroscopy of excited states. Studies of the B c mass spectrum can reveal information on heavy-quark dynamics and improve our understanding of the strong interaction. Due to the presence of two heavy-flavour quarks the mass spectrum of the B c states can be predicted with much better precision than many other hadronic systems. The mass spectrum of the B c family has been calculated with nonrelativistic quark potential models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], nonperturbative phenomenological models [9,10], perturbative QCD [11,12], relativistic quark models [13][14][15][16][17], and lattice QCD [18][19][20][21][22][23]. The ground state of the B c meson family, denoted hereafter as B + c , decays only through the weak interaction, with a relatively long lifetime. The most accurate prediction of the B + c mass, M (B + c ) = 6278 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 4 MeV/c 2 [22], is obtained with unquenched lattice QCD.",

At the LHCb experiment, considerable progress has been made on measurements of the B + c production [26][27][28][29][30], spectroscopy [26,[31][32][33][34], lifetime [35,36], and new decay modes [30,33,[37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45].

As the B 0 s mass is known with limited precision, the difference between the B + c and B 0 s masses, \u2206M = M (B + c ) \u2212 M (B 0 s ), is also measured, such that improvements in the B + s mass measurement allow for a more precise B + c mass determination. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.0 fb \u22121 , collected with the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. The integrated luminosity used in this analysis is at least three times the one used in previous LHCb measurements [26,[31][32][33] and the results of this paper supersede those earlier B + c mass measurements.",

            "text": "This LHCb detector [48,49] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [50], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [51,52] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The momentum scale is calibrated using samples of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays collected concurrently with the data sample used for this analysis [53,54]. The relative accuracy of this procedure is determined to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 using samples of other fully reconstructed B, \u03a5 and K 0 S -meson decays. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [55]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of a scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [56]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [57], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which performs a full event reconstruction.",
