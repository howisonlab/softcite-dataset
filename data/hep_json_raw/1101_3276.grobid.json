This paper reviews PID strategies and methods used by the large LHC experiments, which provide outstanding examples of the state-of-the-art. The first part focuses on the general design of these experiments with respect to PID and the technologies used. Three PID techniques are discussed in more detail: ionization measurements, time-of-flight measurements and Cherenkov imaging. Four examples of the implementation of these techniques at the LHC are given, together with selections of relevant examples from other experiments and short overviews on new developments. Finally, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS 02) experiment is briefly described as an impressive example of a space-based experiment using a number of familiar PID techniques.",

            "text": "In addition to tracking and calorimetry, Particle IDentification (PID) is a crucial aspect of most particle physics experiments. The identification of stable particles is achieved either by analysing the way they interact, or by determining their mass. The difference in interaction is primarily used for lepton and photon identification. A \"traditional\" particle physics experiment already incorporates this method in its conceptual design, as it is discussed in Sect. 1.1. In order to unambiguously identify hadrons, their charge and mass has to be determinded, which is achieved by simultaneous measurements of momentum and velocity. This method is discussed in Sect. 1.2. The four large experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] and their PID strategies are introduced briefly in Sect. 2. Three methods to determine the mass of a charged particle and examples of their implementation at the LHC experiments are discussed in Sects. 3 (ionization), 4 (time-of-flight) and 5 (Cherenkov radiation imaging). A fourth important method, the detection of transition radiation, is not discussed, since it is the topic of a separate paper in this issue [2]. In Sect. 6 finally the AMS 02 experiment is briefly described as an example for the usage of PID techniques from accelerator-based particle physics experiments in space.",

The charged parent (kaon) decays into a neutral daughter (not detected) and a charged daughter with the same sign.

The most natural example is particle spectra, from which the freeze-out parameters (such as the kinetic and chemical freeze-out temperature and the collective flow velocity) can be extracted. Besides pions, kaons and protons, also resonances such as the \u03c6 meson can be used for such analysis. Actually, any modification in the mass and width of the \u03c6 meson could be a signature for partial chiral symmetry restoration, and thus, creation of a quark-gluon plasma. The \u03c6 resonance is typically identified via its hadronic decay channel \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , which makes a good hadron ID important. Leptonic channels are very important as well and thus extremely good lepton ID is needed. ALICE also studies p-p collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 14 TeV. These data are important as a reference for the heavy-ion data. Moreover, due to the very low mo-mentum cut-off (\u223c0.1 GeV/c), ALICE can contribute in physics areas where it complements the other LHC experiments. To name an example, the measurement of charm and beauty cross sections is possible down to very low momenta. Moreover, proton physics at high multiplicities is easily accessible via the multiplicity trigger from the Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD).",

The RICH detectors are described in more detail in Sect. 5.4. An EM calorimeter and a hadron calorimeter provide the identification of electrons, hadrons and neutral particles (photons and \u03c0 0 ) as well as the measurement of their energies and positions. The EM calorimeter is a rectangular wall constructed out of lead plates and scintillator tiles. The total thickness corresponds to 25 X 0 . In a beam test it was found that the relative energy resolution follows (\u03c3 E /E) 2 = (0.094/ E (GeV)) 2 + (0.145/E (GeV)) 2 + 0.0083 2 . The hadronic calorimeter consists of iron and scintillator tiles with a relative energy resolution of (\u03c3 E /E) 2 = (0.69/ E (GeV)) 2 + 0.09 2 , measured with a prototype in a beam test. Finally, the muon system is designed to provide a fast trigger on high momentum muons as well as offline muon indentification for the reconstruction of muonic final states and beauty flavor tagging. It consists of five stations (M1-M5) equipped mainly with Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs). For the innermost region of station M1, which has the highest occupancy, Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) [19] are used. For a muon PID efficiency of 90% the misidentification rate is only about 1.5%.",

Typical values for E cut depend on the strength of the magnetic field and lie in the range 10 to 100 keV. Eq. 8 is valid for electrons and also for heavier particles. In the low energy region (i.e. \u03b2\u03b3 < 0.5) the average energy loss decreases like 1/\u03b2 2 and reaches a broad minimum of ionisation (MIP region) at \u03b2\u03b3 \u2248 4. For larger values of \u03b2\u03b3 the average energy loss begins to rise roughly proportional to log(\u03b2\u03b3) (relativistic rise) with a strength defined by the mean excitation energy I. The rise is reduced at higher momenta by the density effect correction \u03b4. A remaining relativistic rise would be due to (rare) large energy transfers to a few electrons. Since these events are removed in Eq. 8 by the introduction of E cut , the restricted average energy loss approaches a constant value (the Fermi plateau) as \u03b2\u03b3 increases. For solids, due to a stronger density effect, the Fermi plateau is only a few percent above the minimum.",

In a collider experiment like ALICE, the field cage of a TPC is typically divided into two halves separated by a planar central electrode made by a thin membrane. The electrons produced by charged particles crossing the field cage drift towards the two end-caps, where readout detectors are mounted. In general, a gated wire grid is installed directly in front of the readout chambers. When the system is triggered, the gate opens, allowing the passage of the ionization electrons, which create charge avalanches in the readout detectors. Closing the gate assures that the ions created in the avalanche process do not enter the drift volume. Measuring the signals induced on adjacent readout pads makes possible an accurate determination of the position by evaluating the center of gravity. Together with accurate measurements of the arrival time (relative to some external reference such as the collision time of the beams) the complete trajectory of all charged particles traversing the TPC can be determined. Due to the little amount of dead volume and the easy pattern recognition (continuous tracks), TPCs are the best tracking devices for high multiplicity environments, e.g. heavy-ion experiments.",

In November 2010 the first Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s N N = 2.76 TeV were recorded. The energy resolution of the TPC in these heavy-ion collisions was found to degrade slightly to an average of about 5.3%. This effect is expected due to overlapping signals from neighboring tracks. The energy resolution for the highest multiplicity events falls off by 20% with respect to low multiplicities. Part of the increase is also explained by baseline fluctuations in the electronics due to large hit densities in single channels. These fluctuations can in the future be minimised using the signal tail cancellation and baseline correction features available in the TPC front-end electronics. In the course of the year 2011, higher luminosities will be reached and space charge effects and gating efficiency will have to be accurately evaluated to avoid negative effects on the tracking and ionization sampling.",

However, since in solid media due to a stronger density effect the Fermi plateau is only slightly above the minimum, good \u03c0/K (p/K) separation is achievable only up to 450 MeV/c (up to 1 GeV/c). Again, the energy loss is estimated as a truncated mean in order to minimize the influence of Landau fluctuations. In ALICE, the resolution of the measurement in two layers each of silicon strip and drift detectors is about 11%. In the CMS tracking system, the signal amplitudes from ten layers of silicon strip detectors may be used, but a resolution was not known to the author at the time of writing this review.",

Their advantages are the high rate capability and a low ion feedback. Large TPC protopypes with different readout options were built tested [35]. The conventional readout of the micro-pattern device, with mm-sized cathode pads, may actually be replaced by a digital device with pixel sizes of the order 55 \u00b5m. A family of ASIC chips is particularly suited for this purpose: MEDIPIX [36] and its successor TIMEPIX [37], which records also the time. This kind of setup has been shown to detect tracks of minimum ionizing charged particles (MIPs) with excellent single-electron efficiency and unprecedented spatial resolution. In this way, the cluster counting method may be used to assess the energy deposit through ionization: rather than measuring the deposited charge, the number of primary collision clusters are counted. This avoids the problems related to the fluctuation of the energy transfer in single collisions (see Sects. 3.3 and 3.4) and should provide the ultimate resolution of \u223c2% [38].",

In current experiments for subnuclear research, detectors using scintillation (the property of luminescence when excited by ionizing radiation) are very commonly used due to their good time resolution. However, as the experiments have gradually increased in size, and since the readout of scintillator detectors is expensive, the cost per area became an important issue. The Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) was found to provide a simpler technology at a much lower price. RPCs can be seen as the successor of the metallic Parallel Plate Avalanche Counters, overcoming their disadvantage of being very vulnerable to the destructive energy released by possible discharges or sparks. The electrode plates of RPCs are made from a resistive material, which effectively restricts excessive signals or discharges to a well localised area of the detector. As a side effect, all charges cause a local drop of the electric field in the gas gap and in this spot the detector becomes insensitive to further traversing particles for a time of the order of the relaxation time \u03c4 = \u03c1 \u03b5 0 \u03b5 r , where \u03b5 0 is the dielectric constant and \u03c1 and \u03b5 r are the volume resistivity and the relative permittivity of the resistive material. Even though the remaining counter area is still sensitive to particles, a limit to the overall rate capability is introduced through this effect. In general, accurate time measurements are feasible up to charged particle rates of a few kHz/cm 2 , which is acceptable for many purposes (compare to Sect. 4.7). The RPC design was improved by introducing the concept of multiple gaps (Multi gap Resistive Plate Chamber, MRPC [40]), resulting in an increase of detection efficiency. Reducing the individual gap sizes [41], while at the same time increasing the electric field, resulted in what is called the Timing RPC, a low cost detector with a time resolution comparable to that of scintillators. The space resolution can be chosen by different sizes of the readout strips.",

The NA49 and STAR experiments have shown [50,51] how the hadron identification capability may be extended by combining the PID informations from TPC and TOF. Moreover, a reliable identification of electrons is possible up to a few GeV/c in this way, since the hadrons (which for a given momentum are slower) can be eliminated with a cut on the particle velocity. The ALICE TOF detector [52] is based on MRPCs. 91 MRPCs each are assembled into gas tight modules in 18 azimuthal sectors (supermodules) surrounding the ALICE TPC and TRD (see Fig. 8). The supermodules have about 9 m length, covering the pseudo-rapidity interval |\u03b7| < 0.9. More than 150 000 readout pads with size 2.5\u00d73.5 cm 2 cover an area of about 150 m 2 .

This is due to the finite length of the colliding bunches of particles. In ALICE, t 0 is precisely measured by a dedicated detector 10 (T0) [13], which reduces this uncertainty to \u03c3 t 0 = 50 ps. With the much larger statistics that is available from data samples with collisions provided by the LHC, the work now focuses on reducing the contribution \u03c3 Cal . A further improvement can be achieved for high multiplicity Pb-Pb events, where the accuracy of the event start time measurement is expected to improve to \u03c3 t 0 = 10 ps. In that case an overall system resolution \u03c3 T OF = 65 ps is possible (compare to Tab. 2). Fig. 18 shows the correlation between the track momentum measured by the ALICE tracking detectors and the velocity \u03b2 as measured by the TOF system. The data were recorded during the first \u221a s = 7 TeV p-p collisions in 2010 and clearly show two times four bands corresponding to four particle species and their corresponding anti-particles. Data outside these bands indicates errors in the association of tracks to TOF PID signals. A particle is identified when the corresponding point in the diagram of Fig. 18 can be associated with only one theoretical curve (Eq. 12) within the measurement errors. For certain momentum regions histograms are filled and fitted with multiple Gaussians, similar to the procedure described in Sect. 3.7. An example is shown in Fig. 19. For a given TOF measurement one can derive the particle yields, which represent the probabilities for the particle to be a kaon, proton, pion or electron. The power of combining TOF and ionization measurements for PID is demonstrated for in Fig. 20.",

LHCb chose Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPD) [86], which combine the photon sensitivity of vacuum PMTs with the excellent spatial and energy resolutions of silicon sensors. The conversion of the photoelectrons takes place in the quartz window with bialkali photocathode and they are then accelerated through a potential difference of about 20 kV and detected by a silicon pixel chip. HPDs are sensitive to single photons in the wavelength range from 200 to 600 nm with a quantum efficiency of about 31%. About 65% of the detection plane is covered with read out pixels. The photoelectron trajectories are deformed by the magnetic field of the large LHCb dipole magnet. This effect can be corrected by comparing reproducible light-spot patterns, that are illuminated onto the photon detector plane, with magnetic field on and off.",

For the aerogel radiator, the refractive index was found to change from its initial value of n = 1.03 to n = 1.037 in the experiment, which is probably explained by absorption of C 4 F 10 , since the aerogel material is not sealed from the gas volume.

The likelihood is maximised by varying the particle hypotheses of each track to be an electron, muon, pion, kaon or proton. In this way efficient K/\u03c0 separation is achieved with high purity [18]: the average efficiency for kaon ID for momenta between 2 and 100 GeV/c is at the level of 90%, with a corresponding average pion misidentification rate below 5%.

The corresponding Cherenkov rings are overlapping on the photon detector, which leads to an optimised angular resolution. Such a proximity-focusing RICH with inhomogeneous aerogel radiator is proposed for the endcap region of the upgraded Belle spectrometer [108,109].

An impressive example of a space-based experiment using a number of familiar PID techniques is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS 02 [113], see Fig. 30). The purposes of the experiment are to search for cosmic antimatter and dark matter and to study the composition and energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays. The AMS 02 is set for installation on the International Space Station (ISS). It will be transported in the cargo bay of the space shuttle on its final mission, scheduled for 2011. The experiment will be attached to the outside of the space station and gather data that will be sent to a ground station for analysis. The AMS 02 experiment is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector in space. The initial design included a superconducting magnet (0.9 T), which was however recently replaced by a permanent magnet (0.14 T) which allows the experiment to remain operational for the entire lifetime of the ISS (up to 18 years). The setup further includes a high-precision, double sided silicon strip detector and 4 dedicated PID devices: a TRD for electron ID (straw tubes filled with a mixture of Xe and CO 2 and fleece radiators), a proximity-focusing RICH with an aerogel radiator (n = 1.03) for determination of the particle velocities and charges 12 , a TOF detector (four planes of plastic scintillators) providing velocity determination and a fast trigger, and a sampling EM calorimeter (lead absorber plates and scintillating fibres). The whole system provides identification of particles and isotopes up to iron.",

Some long-lived particles (leptons and photons) can be identified from the signatures they leave in the different layers of a typical experiment. Distinguishing the different long-lived charged hadrons (pions, kaons and protons) is more challenging, but often their identification is crucial, e.g. for precision measurements of rare processes with high statistics. Usually dedicated detectors are required for the task, which are based on the determination of the particle's mass by simultaneous measurements of momentum p and velocity \u03b2 = v/c. The velocity is obtained by one of four techniques: measurement of the energy deposited through ionization, measurement of the time-of-flight, imaging of Cherenkov radiation or detection of transition radiation (transition radiation is not covered by this review). An illustrative comparison of the methods is shown in Fig. 5. The Cherenkov imaging method is the most flexible, as it allows to tune the response of the detector by varying the refractive index (and the length of the radiator), and makes accessible also very high momenta (>100 GeV/c). The Cherenkov and time-offlight techniques can be used to close the gap in momentum in the MIP region, where PID by ionization measurements is not possible. All techniques are very well understood, with detectors being of the second, third or fourth generation, but the use and sophistication is still increasing as new generation detectors are built.",

Different concepts are followed: the two specialised experiments, ALICE for heavy-ion collisions and LHCb for B physics, make use of specific techniques adapted to their physics program. In both cases PID at low transverse momentum (but high total momentum in the case of LHCb) is important. ALICE actually uses all existing PID techniques. The general purpose detectors on the other hand, ATLAS and CMS, follow the traditional setup of a particle physics experiment: a tracking system, EM and hadron calorimeters and a muon system arranged in layers, with large acceptance for the identification of charged hadrons, photons and leptons. For their physics program, the challenges for precision calorimetry and precision muon detection are extremely high. Here the two experiments are actually following complementary approaches, but it can be expected that they are very competitive. All four experiments are very well advanced with the detector calibration. They have started to record data as the LHC began delivering p-p collisions in the year 2009. In the course of the year 2010, the increasing luminosity allowed real stress tests of the systems. At the end of that year also the first heavy-ion collisions were recorded by ALICE, ATLAS and CMS.",
