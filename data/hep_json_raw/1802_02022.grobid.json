The results are compared to the pp spectra of charged hadrons at the same centre-of-mass energy based on the data sample with integrated luminosity of 4.2 pb \u22121 obtained by the ATLAS experiment in 2011 and 2013. This allows a detailed comparison of the two collision systems in a wide transverse momentum (0.5 < pT < 150 GeV) and pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 2) ranges in different centrality intervals of Pb+Pb collision. The nuclear modification factor RAA is presented in detail as a function of centrality, pT and \u03b7. It shows a distinct pT-dependence with a pronounced minimum at about 7 GeV. Above 60 GeV, it is consistent with a flat, centrality-dependent, value within the uncertainties. The value is 0.55 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b1 0.04(syst.) in the most central collisions. The RAA is observed to be consistent with flat |\u03b7| dependence over the whole transverse momentum range in all centrality classes.",

The measurement of jets by the ATLAS and AL-ICE experiments revealed that yield of jets at fixed transverse momentum (p T ), caused by the energy loss of the high-energy partons in the medium, is suppressed by a factor of two to four [3,4]. Additional information about the energy-loss mechanism is obtained from the study of jet fragmentation functions that show a small enhancement at p T 30 GeV [5,6].",

It first increases and reaches a maximum at p T \u2248 2 GeV. Then it decreases to a minimum at p T \u2248 7 GeV, where the suppression is the strongest. Above this p T , R AA increases up to p T \u2248 60 GeV and then reaches a plateau. The plateau is consistent with zero slope. In the most central collisions, it has a value of 0.55 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b1 0.04(syst.). Figure 4 shows the nuclear modification factor R AA as a function of \u03b7 in four momentum intervals corresponding to the local maximum (1.7 < p T < 2.0 GeV), the local minimum (6.7 < p T < 7.7 GeV), the plateau region (59.8 < p T < 94.8 GeV) and to the p T interval where R AA has an intermediate value (19.9 < p T < 22.8 GeV). For all intervals R AA shows a weak dependence on |\u03b7| and it is generally consistent with a flat behaviour within the statistical and systematic uncertainties.  Figure 4 -The nuclear modification factor R AA as a function of \u03b7 in four momentum intervals discussed in the text [7]. Statistical uncertainties are shown with vertical bars and systematic uncertainties with brackets. Figure 5 shows a comparison of R AA measured for charged hadrons and that for jets. The chargedhadron R AA is shown for the plateau region. Jets are shown for three different p T regions. The lowest one agrees to the p T region of charged hadrons. Jets from the intermediate intervals produce main portion of shown charged hadrons. Having fixed p T of composing hadrons, two contradictory trends meet here -the decreasing p T spectrum of the jets, not unlike the charged-hadron spectrum, and the increasing fragmentation function when going toward lower z. Jets from the highest p T region are composed mostly from shown hadrons, due to the fragmentation functions. It is the R AA of jets from the highest p T interval that overlap with hadron R AA the best, at least for more central collisions.  Figure 5 -The nuclear modification factor R AA as a function of Npart measured for jets [3] and charged hadrons [7,20]. Statistical uncertainties are shown with vertical bars and systematic uncertainties with brackets (charged hadrons) or bands (jets).",
