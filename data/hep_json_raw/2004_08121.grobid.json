The initial model of \"standard\" axion assumed the symmetrybreaking scale f A to be similar to the electro-weak interactions scale, but subsequently it was excluded by a series of experiments (the extensive list can be found in corresponding section of [4]). Afterwards, the initial axion model has been expanded into two classes of \"invisible\" axion models: hadronic (KSVZ) axion [5,6] and GUT (DFSZ) axion [7,8]. These models allow f A to be arbitrary large, therefore reducing the expected axion mass and suppressing the axion interactions with ordinary matter, effectively rendering it \"invisible\". a e-mail: unzhakov_ev@pnpi.nrcki.ru (corresponding author)",

Axion interaction with electrons of atomic shells (g Ae ) can cause axio-electric effect (similarly to the photo-ionization) or Compton-like processes.

A \"solid target + semiconductor detector\" layout has been successfully employed for previous axion searches with various targets ( 7 Li [14], 169 Tm [15], 57 Fe [16]). On the other hand, 57 Fe and 169 Tm nuclei have low-energy excited states with significant conversion ratios (\u03b7 \u223c 10 \u22123 ), so the most transitions would actually produce conversion or Auger electrons and characteristic Xrays, instead of nuclear \u03b3 -quanta.
