Hard hadron quasi-real photo-production with polarized initial states is sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution \u2206G through \u03b3-gluon(g) direct channels as well as q-g resolved processes. Comparisons of unpolarized differential cross section measurements to next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations are essential to develop our understanding of proton-proton and lepton-nucleon scattering at varying center of mass energies. These measurements are important to asses the applicability of NLO pQCD in interpreting polarized processes. In this talk we will discuss unidentified charged separated hadron production at low Q 2 (Q 2 < 0.1 GeV 2 /c 2 ) and high transverse momenta (pT > 1.0 GeV /c). < p 2",

Asymmetries are the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized cross-sections (equation 2). These measurements offer an elegant way of accessing parton information by counting observed particle yields in different helicity states of the interacting beam(s) and target (++, \u2212\u2212 versus +\u2212, \u2212+.) These are normalized by the polarization in the beam and the target (P B , P T ) times the dilution factor F .",

These unpolarized measurements add new results at different \u221a s than those available [3]. In addition to verifying applicable theoretical calculations, cross-sections can help constrain the FF's [4] which introduce an uncertainty into these models. The aim of the current work is to contribute with measurements of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) cross-sections at \u221a s = 17 GeV . Unpolarized SIDIS probes the number density of partons with a fraction x of the momentum of the parent nucleon. The detection of the outgoing lepton in a SIDIS measurement allows the access, among other kinematic variables, to the Q 2 and y of the events and not just the p T of the final state hadrons.",

Production of these final state hadrons proceed from direct photon-parton \u03b3 dir \u2212 (q,q, g) and resolved photon-parton \u03b3 res \u2212 (q,q, g) initiated sub-processes in \u00b5 \u2212 deuteron center of mass (cm) collisions (figure 2.) The \u03b3 dir \u2212 (q,q, g) NLO contributions are those for which the hadrons are produced immediately after the virtual photon interacts directly with the target partons. The \u03b3 res \u2212(q,q, g) processes are those where the photon fluctuates into partons before interacting with the target. These latter processes are akin to hadroproduction from proton-proton collisions such as those at RHIC or at the LHC, where the partons from the incoming beam interact with the target(beam) partons. Previous comparisons of pQCD calculations for hadron production at different experiments and \u221a s ranges have been done in [3] (figure 2.) The results of these comparisons showed that the pQCD calculations could not correctly describe hadron production proceeding from proton-proton data throughout all the different \u221a s. Only collisions at higher energies seemed to be properly described by the calculations. The failure of the calculations to describe hadron production at lower center of mass energies has opened the question of pQCD applicability at these energy regimes. Other issues which have been raised point out that perhaps the experiments at different center of mass energies do not correspond to the same physics phenomena, in particular at forward rapidity values. It is our present aim to compare the COMPASS measurements to NLO calculations which take into account full COMPASS kinematics. These partonic contributions and predictions at COMPASS energies have been previously calculated in [1] and [2].",

The proton beam is extracted from the CERN's SPS at a cycle of approximately 17 seconds. The resulting muon beam from each cycle is then collided on a two cell 6 LiD target. The two stage forward spectrometer tracks particles from these interactions with a rate capability of a few MHz/channel [5] and a spacial precision better than 100 \u00b5m. Particles can be detected at very small angles (\u223c 1 mrad) and large angles (\u223c 120 mrad for the current data set under study.) These scattering angles correspond to a primarily positive pseudo-rapidity coverage (\u03b7 cm ) that can reach up to the forward values of \u223c 2.

The GEANT based program simulated the response of the detector setup for the events generated by PYTHIA. The validity of the Monte-Carlo's description of the data was evaluated by estimating the data over Monte-Carlo ratio in different kinematic and laboratory variables pertinent to the measurement. To accomplish this, histograms normalized by number of entries of data and Monte-Carlo were compared. The generated distributions described well the shapes of the real distributions as it can be inspected from figure 3. A good description of the experimental distribution in any given variable allows one to rely on the MC to extract the detector's acceptance and efficiency. This acceptance extraction can be done as a function the described variable in one dimension (1D). If the simulation can only poorly describe reality, a multi-dimensional (>2D) extraction of the acceptance is needed. Extraction of acceptances in both 1D as a function of p T and 2D were performed and results were found compatible.",

Spectra at high Q 2 have been also measured as a function of several kinematical variables. These measurements aim at extracting intrinsic < k 2 T > information and improve current transverse spin parametrizations. At the time of the SPIN2010 symposium, results for the measurements at low Q 2 had not yet released publicly. Charged separated cross-sections results as well as the ratio of h \u2212 to h + have since been released and can be accessed through the COMPASS public page or by email request.",
