            "text": "Charm meson spectroscopy provides a powerful test of the quark model predictions of the Standard Model. Many charm meson states, predicted in the 1980s [1], have not yet been observed experimentally. The expected spectrum for the c\u016b system is shown in figure 1 (the spectrum of the cd system is almost identical). The J P states having P = (\u22121) J and therefore J P = 0 + , 1 \u2212 , 2 + , . . . are called natural parity states and are labelled as D * , while unnatural parity indicates the series J P = 0 \u2212 , 1 + , 2 \u2212 , . . . The low-mass spectrum of the c\u016b system is comprised of the ground states (1S), the orbital excitations with angular momentum L=1, 2 (1P, 1D), and the first radial excitations (2S). Apart from the ground states (D, D * ), only two of the 1P states, D 1 (2420) and D * 2 (2460) [2], are experimentally well established since they have relatively narrow widths (\u223c30 MeV). 1 In contrast, the broad L = 1 states, D * 0 (2400) and D 1 (2430), have been established by the Belle and BaBar experiments in exclusive B decays [3,4]. . Modified Godfrey-Isgur mass predictions [1]. The figure shows the c\u016b spectrum in which the masses have been scaled such that the ground state coincides with the D 0 mass. The 2 \u2212 states, not shown in the original publication, have been inserted following the splitting structure of the 1P states.",

In the cs system, the J P = 0 + and J P = 1 + states (both L = 1) have predicted masses about 100 MeV higher than the measured masses of the D sJ mesons. To quantitatively assess the accuracy of the quark model predictions, assumptions are needed to formulate a wave equation for quark-antiquark bound states starting from the QCD Lagrangian [5]. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the predictions of various models and the mass measurements [6][7][8][9] suggests that some observed states in the cs case are not simple quark-antiquark configurations. Possible interpretations include more complex structures, such as bound states (\"molecules\") of other mesons [10], or mixtures of conventional quark-antiquark with four-quark components [11].",

Charged tracks are required to have good track fit quality, momentum p > 3 GeV and p T > 250 MeV. These conditions are relaxed to lower limits for the pion originating directly from the D * + decay.

All tracks used to reconstruct the mesons must have a distance of closest approach to each other smaller than 0.5 mm. The cosine of the angle between the momentum of the D meson candidate and its direction, defined by the positions of the primary vertex and the meson decay vertex, is required to be larger than 0.99999.

A further reduction of the combinatorial background is achieved by performing an optimization of the signal significance and purity as a function of p T of the D ( * ) \u03c0 \u00b1 system using the well known D 1 (2420) and D * 2 (2460) resonances. 3 For this purpose, we fit the three mass spectra as explained in section 7 and section 9 and obtain, for each resonance, the signal yield N S and background yield N B events. We compute the signal significance S = N S / \u221a N S + N B and signal purity P = N S /(N S + N B ) and find that the requirement p T (D ( * ) \u03c0) > 7.5 GeV provides a good compromise between significance and purity.
