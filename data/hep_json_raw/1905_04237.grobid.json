Here I present IceCube's High-Energy Starting Event sample and the new results obtained with a livetime of about 7.5 years. I will focus on the new measurement of the flavor composition performed using this sample. IceCube is directly sensitive to each neutrino flavor via the single cascade, track and double cascade event topologies, the latter being the topology produced in tauneutrino interactions above an energy threshold of \u223c100 TeV. A measurement of the flavor ratio on Earth can provide important constraints on sources and production mechanisms within the standard model, and also constrain various beyond-standard-model processes.",

In the meantime, the understanding of the detector, as well as the atmospheric backgrounds to the astrophysical neutrino searches have improved. This has triggered a full re-analysis of IceCube data using the HESE event selection with 7.5 years of data and improved techniques.",

The latest knowledge of the ice optical properties has been incorporated into the simulation chain and the reconstruction updated, and a newly developed likelihood taking limited Monte Carlo statistics into account is being used. A new calculation of the atmospheric self-veto [4] is used, describing the probability of atmospheric neutrinos to be rejected due to accompanying muons from the same cosmic ray induced shower. Further, a designated algorithm to determine the topology of the events [5] has been incorporated. Not only is this superior to the previously used by-eye classification, it can also distinguish three topologies: the well known single cascades created by all-flavor Neutral Current (NC) interactions, Charged Current (CC) \u03bd e and CC \u03bd \u03c4 interactions; the tracks created by CC \u03bd \u00b5 interactions as well as atmospheric muons, and CC \u03bd \u03c4 interactions where the tau lepton decays muonically; and the double cascades. The latter topology opens up at high energies, when a CC \u03bd \u03c4 interaction can produce two cascades that can be individually resolved in space and time [6]. The 7.5 year HESE sample has 60 events with reconstructed energies above 60 TeV, with 12 (5) new events observed in the 2016 (2017) data taking season. The best fit of the HESE events with a reconstructed deposited energy above 60 TeV is a single power-law with \u03a6 = 2.19 +1.10 \u22120.55 \u2022 10 \u221218 \u2022 (E/100 TeV) \u22122.91 +0.33 \u22120.22 GeV cm \u22122 s \u22121 sr \u22121 per neutrino flavor. The best fit yields a vanishing prompt component, with the 90% upper limit being 12.3 times the theoretical prediction in the BERSS model [7]. Our results are compatible with the previous results using in the 6-year HESE update [3] as well as with the fit performed on the through-going muon [8] sample.

To classify the events with deposited energies above 60 TeV we use an algorithm first applied to the 6 year HESE sample [5], developed with the goal of achieving a high \u03bd \u03c4 purity in the final double cascade topology sub-sample. Observables used for classification are the double cascade length, the asymmetry between the two cascades' energies (called energy asymmetry herafter), and the fraction of the total energy deposited close to the cascade vertices (called energy confinement herafter). Events passing the quality, energy asymmetry and energy confinement cuts are classified as double cascades. Above 60",

A multi-component maximum-likelihood fit is performed on the three topology samples using two-dimensional PDFs obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. For single cascades and tracks, the observables Deposited Energy and Cosine \u03b8 z are used, where \u03b8 z is the zenith angle. For double cascades, Total Deposited Energy and Double Cascade Length are used. For \u03bd \u03c4 induced double cascades, we expect a correlation between the energy of the event and the tau decay length. Events stemming from other flavors typically cluster at the thresholds, both in energy due to the falling spectrum and in double cascade length due to the very small mean reconstructed double cascade length for true single cascades. The PDFs for signal and background are shown in Figure 1 with the data events overlaid as white circles. The result of the flavor composition measurement and the sensitivity are shown in Figure 2. Note that not all systematic uncertainties have been taken into account yet in this work in progress. This analysis yields \u03bd e : \u03bd \u00b5 : \u03bd \u03c4 = 0.29 : 0.50 : 0.21 as the best fit flavor composition. This is consistent with previously published results by Ice-Cube [5,10,11], as well as with the expectation of \u223c 1 : 1 : 1 flavor composition on Earth coming from a pion decay production mechanism. The two observed double cascades are shown in Figure 3. The grey circles mark the reconstructed cascade positions, with the arrow indicating the reconstructed direction. For several Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), the photon counts over time are displayed alongside with the predicted photon count PDFs for a single cascade and double cascade hypothesis. Note that the DOMs labeled as \"bright\" 1 were excluded from the reconstruction. The left panel shows the event observed in 2012. Several DOMs near the interaction vertex are saturated and excluded from the reconstruction. Two further bright DOMs have been excluded as well. The photon count rates do not show a clear preference for a single vs. a double cascade hypothesis. The right panel on Figure 3 shows the event observed in 2014. Also this event has several bright DOMs which have been excluded from the reconstruction. For this event,",

The analysis found the first two double cascades, indicative of \u03bd \u03c4 -CC interactions, with an expectation of 1.4 \u03bd \u03c4 -induced signal events and 0.7 \u03bd e,\u00b5 -induced background events. The best fit flavor composition is \u03bd e : \u03bd \u00b5 : \u03bd \u03c4 = 0.29 : 0.50 : 0.21, consistent with all previously published results by IceCube, as well as with the expectation of \u223c 1 : 1 : 1 for astrophysical neutrinos. The first event has an energy asymmetry very close to the cut value at the boundary of the signal region. The photon arrival pattern does not show a clear preference between a single and double cascade hypothesis. The second event lies in a signal dominated region and the photon arrival pattern is well described with a double cascade hypothesis, but not with a single cascade hypothesis. An a posteriori analysis is ongoing to determine the compatibility of each of the events with a background hypothesis.",
