Using 410 g of 116 Cd installed in the detector with an exposure of 5.26 y, (4968\u00b174) events corresponding to the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd to the ground state of 116 Sn have been observed with a signal to background ratio of about 12. The half-life of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay has been measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.74 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b1 0.18(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y. No events have been observed above the expected background while searching for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. The corresponding limit on the half-life is determined to be T 0\u03bd 1/2 \u2265 1.0 \u00d7 10 23 y at the 90% C.L. which corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of m\u03bd \u2264 1.4 \u2212 2.5 eV depending on the nuclear matrix elements considered. Limits on other mechanisms generating 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay such as the exchange of R-parity violating supersymmetric particles, right-handed currents and majoron emission are also obtained.",

            "text": "Experimental searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) are one of the most active research topics in neutrino physics. The observation of such a process is of major importance since it will prove the Majorana nature of neutrinos and may give access to their absolute mass scale. The Majorana nature of the neutrino would also have interesting implications in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. For instance the see-saw mechanism requires the existence of a Majorana neutrino to explain the lightness of neutrino masses [1][2][3][4]. A Majorana neutrino would also provide a natural framework for lepton number violation, and particularly for the leptogenesis process which may explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe [5]. The standard underlying mechanism behind neutrinoless double-beta decay is the exchange of a light Majorana neutrino. In this case, the decay rate can be written as:",

            "text": "(1) where g A is the axial vector coupling constant, G 0\u03bd is the kinematical phase space factor that depends on Z and the nuclear transition energy Q \u03b2\u03b2 , M 0\u03bd is the Nuclear Matrix Element (NME), m e is the electron mass and m \u03bd is the effective neutrino mass. Other mechanisms could be involved in this process such as the exchange of supersymmetric particles via an R-parity violating coupling, the existence of right-handed currents in the electroweak interaction, or the emission of scalar bosons such as majorons [6][7][8][9]. They would result in different energy and angular distributions of the emitted \u03b2 particles. For a given mechanism and isotope, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life depends on the phase space factor and on the NME. Due to different values of NMEs and phase space factors for different nuclei, the decay half-lives of different isotopes can differ by a few orders of magnitude. 116 Cd is one of the best candidates to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay given that the high Q-value of (2813.50 \u00b1 0.13) keV [10] lies above most natural radioactive backgrounds. The first observation of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay in 116 Cd was reported in 1995 by three independent experiments. ELEGANT-V observed the two neutrino double-beta decay of 116 Cd using natural and enriched cadmium foils sandwiched between drift chambers for trajectory reconstruction, plastic scintillators for energy measurement and sodium iodide scintillators to enhance background rejection. The half-life of T 2\u03bd 1/2 = 2.6 +0.9 \u22120.5 \u00d7 10 19 y was measured for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay and an upper limit of T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.9 \u00d7 10 21 y at 90 % C.L. was set for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay with an exposure of 0.02 kg\u00d7y in terms of 116 Cd mass [11]. A compatible measurement was obtained with CdWO 4 crystals enriched to 83 % in 116 Cd at the Solotvina Underground laboratory. The halflife for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay was measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.7 +0.5 \u22120.4 (stat.) +0.9 \u22120.6 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y and the upper limit on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life was set to T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.9 \u00d7 10 22 y at 90 % C.L. with an exposure of 0.13 kg\u00d7y [12]. In the same year, the NEMO-2 experiment reported a measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life of 116 Cd employing a tracking chamber and a plastic scintillator calorimeter [13]. The final measurement from NEMO-2 was performed in 1996 and reported a 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life of T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [3.75 \u00b1 0.35(stat.) \u00b1 0.21(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y [14] (later corrected to T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.9 \u00b1 0.3(stat.) \u00b1 0.2(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y [15]) with an exposure of 0.11 kg\u00d7y. The lower limit on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay via light Majorana neutrino exchange was T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 5 \u00d7 10 21 y at 90 % C.L. [14]. In recent years the study of the \u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd continued using CdWO 4 scintillator crystals. The Solotvina experiment [16] employed 330 g of crystals for a total exposure of 0.4 kg\u00d7y and reported a measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life corresponding to T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.9 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) +0.4 \u22120.3 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y. The lower limit on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life corresponds to T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 1.7 \u00d7 10 23 y at 90 % C.L.. The Aurora experiment [17] employs 1.16 kg of crystals enriched to 82 % in 116 Cd. With an exposure of 0.4 kg\u00d7y the measured half-life of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.62 \u00b1 0.02(stat.) \u00b1 0.14(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y. The limit on the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 1.9 \u00d7 10 23 y at 90 % C.L. and has been obtained with an exposure of 0.3 kg\u00d7y. This paper describe the analysis of the 116 Cd sample installed in the NEMO-3 detector. The NEMO-3 detector is introduced in Section II. The results of the measurement of the different background components are presented in Section III. The measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life is summarised in Section IV. The results of the search for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay are summarised in Section V.",

            "text": "The NEMO-3 detector performed precise measurements of two neutrino double-beta decay and searched for neutrinoless double-beta decay in seven isotopes, among which were 100 Mo (\u223c 7 kg) [18] and 82 Se (\u223c 1 kg) [19]. Smaller amounts of other isotopes such as 130 Te, 116 Cd, 150 Nd, 96 Zr and 48 Ca were also investigated [20][21][22][23][24]. The detector [25] had a cylindrical geometry and was divided into 20 sectors. Each sector consisted of source planes containing the \u03b2\u03b2 emitting isotopes surrounded by a tracker and a calorimeter. The detector was installed in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM), under a rock overburden of 4800 m.w.e. to shield against cosmic rays. The \u03b2\u03b2 events were emitted from thin central source foils (40-60 mg/cm 2 ) suspended between two concentric cylindrical tracking volumes. The tracker was composed of 6180 Geiger cells operating in a gas mixture comprising helium with 4 % ethanol quencher, 1 % argon and 0.15 % water vapour. The tracker allowed the reconstruction of the decay vertices on the foil with an average resolution of 0.5 mm on the transversal plane (xy) and 8.0 mm on the longitudinal axis (z) for 1 MeV electrons. The tracking volume was surrounded by a segmented calorimeter made of 1940 large blocks of plastic scintillator coupled to low radioactivity 5\" and 3\" PMTs. The calorimeter provided a timing resolution of \u03c3 = 250 ps while the energy resolution was \u03c3 E /E = 5.8%/ E(MeV) for the scintillator equipped with 5\" PMTs, and \u03c3 E /E = 7.2%/ E(MeV) for the scintillator equipped with 3\" PMTs. The detector was immersed in a 25 G magnetic field to enhance charged particle identification and was shielded from external gamma rays by 19 cm of low activity iron and from neutrons by 30 cm of borated water. After one year of data taking, an air-tight tent surrounding the detector and a radon-free air flushing facility were installed to reduce the radon contamination in the tracking chamber by a factor of six. The detector energy calibration has been performed by simultaneously introducing 60 radioactive sources in the detector through 20 calibration tubes located near the source foils. The absolute energy scale calibration was performed every three weeks with 207 Bi sources which provide internal conversion electrons of 482 keV and 976 keV. The rare 1682 keV internal conversion electron peak of 207 Bi was used to determine the systematic uncertainty on the energy scale which was found to be within 0.2 % for 99 % of the PMTs. The energy scale was also tested with the end-point of the \u03b2 spectrum of 90 Y sources (Q \u03b2 = 2.28 MeV) and of 214 Bi (Q \u03b2 = 3.27 MeV) from 222 Rn in the tracker volume. The linearity of the PMTs was verified regularly with light injection tests. Deviation from the linear response was found to be within 1 % for energies < 4 MeV. The same light injection system is also used to survey the relative gain and time variation of individual PMTs twice a day. PMTs that show a gain variation above 5 % compared to a linear interpolation between two successive absolute calibrations with 207 Bi are excluded from the analysis. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed using the DECAY0 event generator [26] with a GEANT3-based [27] detector simulation. The main feature of NEMO-3 was its unique capability to fully reconstruct the kinematics of the events. This allowed for topological selection of the events to be performed among the final states of interest. This helps to reduce backgrounds and to discriminate between different mechanisms beyond the neutrinoless double-beta decay [28]. A total of 440 g of metallic cadmium was placed in one sector of the NEMO-3 detector. The cadmium sample was enriched in 116 Cd by the centrifugation separation method. An average enrichment of (93.2 \u00b1 0.2) % was achieved yielding a total amount of (410 \u00b1 1) g of 116 Cd. Part of the sample (152 g) was previously measured with the NEMO-2 prototype [13,14]. The Cd was distributed in five strips \u223c 242.3 cm long and \u223c 6.5 cm wide, and two additional strips \u223c 6.3 cm wide placed on the edges of the sector. Each strip was composed of one piece or smaller pieces that were glued together. The full strip was then glued between two 12 \u00b5m thick Mylar sheets to provide mechanical strength in the vertical position. The NEMO-3 detector took data from February 2003 until January 2011. Only runs with stable detector conditions and good energy calibrations are considered. The data taking is divided into two phases which correspond to the run period before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the installation of the anti-radon facility. The total live time from both phases is 5.26 y which corresponds to a total exposure of 2.16 kg\u00d7y with 116 Cd.",

            "text": "The most important backgrounds come from the natural radioactivity of the detector materials due to the presence of long half-life radionuclides, mainly 238 U, 232 Th and their high Q-value decay products such as 214 Bi (Q \u03b2 = 3.27 MeV) and 208 Tl (Q \u03b2 = 4.99 MeV). The presence of 222 Rn emanated from the cavern walls is also particularly troublesome. With its relatively long halflife (3.824 days), 222 Rn can diffuse within the detector and deposit 214 Bi in the tracking chamber. The internal background originates in the source foil from contamination introduced during isotope enrichment, residual contamination after the 116 Cd purification or during the foil production. These include 238 U ( 234m Pa) and 232 Th ( 228 Ac) decay chains, 137 Cs and 40 K. In particular, 228 Ac gives rise to 220 Rn with subsequent generation of 208 Tl. The single-\u03b2 emitters or external \u03b3-rays can mimic two-electron events by double Compton scattering or combined Compton-M\u00f8ller scattering in the foil containing the \u03b2\u03b2 emitter isotope. Since the NEMO-3 detector was capable of identifying different types of particles and event topologies, it has been possible to study the backgrounds by combining tracking, calorimetric and timing information in different channels. Activities of different background components are then obtained by adjusting Monte Carlo distributions to the data in different channels via a binned log-likelihood fit. The NEMO-3 backgrounds are evaluated detector-wise in [29]. In order to provide a more accurate modelling, a dedicated analysis of the backgrounds in the sector containing the 116 Cd foils is performed. The backgrounds coming from the outer part of the detector and from the external \u03b3-ray flux are determined using both external \u03b3-e and crossing-electron events. The external \u03b3-e events are generated by an isolated calorimeter hit consistent with a \u03b3-ray and an electron produced by Compton scattering in the source foil whose track is associated with a different calorimeter hit. The timing of the calorimeter hits must be consistent with an external \u03b3-ray hitting the first calorimeter before producing the electron in the foil. The energy distribution of the \u03b3-e events is shown in Fig. 1. The crossing-electron events are generated by an electron created by Compton scattering in the calorimeter whose track crosses the entire tracking chamber before hitting a second calorimeter. The time-of-flight and the curvature of the track must be consistent with a crossing electron. Both the \u03b3-e and crossing-electron events are required to have a vertex on the 116 Cd foil. The external background is modelled with 40 K, 214 Bi, 228 Ac/ 212 Bi/ 208 Tl, 210 Bi, 60 Co and 234m Pa in the PMT, scintillator surface, iron structure, iron shield and the air surrounding the detector. The deviation between the measurement of the external background in the 116 Cd sector and the results from [29], which correspond to the average external background measured across the entire detector is \u00b115 %. The value is obtained by summing in quadrature the deviation observed for each component of the background model. The background coming from internal 214 Bi contamination and from 222 Rn gas in the tracking chamber is determined studying 1e1\u03b1 events produced by the 214 Bi\u2192 214 Po cascade of the 222 Rn chain. An \u03b1 is defined by a short track with one or more delayed Geiger hits in the proximity of the electron vertex. The coincidence between the electron and the \u03b1 event is delayed by the 214 Po half-life of 163.6 \u00b5s [30] which allows a clean sample of 214 Bi to be obtained. Given the high ionisation of \u03b1 particles, their track length provides the best discrimination of 214 Bi contamination of different origins. The distribution of the delayed \u03b1 track length of nation in the source foil is determined through its decay chain which consists of a \u03b2 decay accompanied by one or more \u03b3s from the excited state of 208 Pb [31]. Requiring an electron in coincidence with two \u03b3s provides the most sensitive channel to measure the 208 Tl contamination. The distribution of the summed electron and \u03b3 energies in the 1e2\u03b3 channel is shown in Fig. 3. The distribution is dominated by 208 Tl for summed energies above 3 MeV. A compatible contamination is observed requiring one electron in coincidence with just one \u03b3. Backgrounds produced by single-\u03b2 emitters are determined with single electrons originating from the 116 Cd foils. A non-uniform distribution of the vertex location of the electron tracks on the foil surface is observed as shown in Fig. 4 with an arbitrary bin width. Three foil regions with different levels of activity appear evident: a high activity region with 200 events/bin, a medium activity region with [100 \u2212 200] events/bin and a low activity region with 100 events/bin. No evidence of high activity spots is observed on the vertex map of events selected in the 1e1\u03b3 channel, suggesting their origin is due to a contamination from single \u03b2-emitters. Since these regions present a well defined shape in the source foil plane, they are defined through a set of rectangular cuts based on the number of events per bin. The medium and low activity region represent 89 % of the foil surface. The background model in these regions is consistent with contamination from 40  these regions differs by about a factor of two. The high activity regions represent 11 % of the foil surface. The background model is consistent with an excess of 234m Pa, most likely due to the excess of glue used to connect small pieces of the 116 Cd foil to form the full strip. The excess of 234m Pa is of a factor of about 20 and 40 with respect to the medium and low activity regions respectively. The high activity regions are rejected from the analysis. The activity of the different background contributions and their impact to the measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life and the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is summarised in Tab. I.",

            "text": "The best sensitivity to measure the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate is obtained in the 2e \u2212 channel. Candidate events must have exactly two electrons with reconstructed vertices inside the 116 Cd foils. The separation between each individually reconstructed vertex must be less than 4 cm radially and 8 cm longitudinally to ensure that the electrons originate from a common vertex. Electron tracks with vertices lying on the high activity regions of the foil which contain an excess of 234m Pa are rejected in order to improve the signal to background ratio. Each of the electron tracks must be at least 50 cm long, have a hit in the first layer of Geiger cells, and be associated to separate scintillator blocks. The impact of the tracks must be on the front face of the scintillator block to ensure optimal energy reconstruction. The energy of each electron is required to be at least 300 keV, as the event rate is dominated   by background decays below this threshold. No delayed tracker hits are allowed within 15 cm of the electron vertices in order to reduce contamination from 214 Bi. To further improve rejection of 214 Bi, prompt Geiger hits unassociated to the electron tracks are not allowed on the opposite side of the foil if the electron tracks are on the same side of the foil. Additional, isolated calorimeter hits which do not have a track associated to them are allowed if the energies are less than 200 keV. This allows for a low level of calorimeter noise in the event, which is not simulated and would therefore introduce an efficiency bias if removed. The timing and the path length of the electrons must be consistent with an origin from the common vertex on the 116 Cd source foil. A total of 5368 data events pass these selection criteria. The expected number of events from the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd is determined using a log-likelihood fit to the sum of the two electron energy distribution dividing the sample into phase 1 and phase 2, and into the medium and low internal background regions of the foil. The background activities are constrained through Gaussian parameters to the values and uncertainties measured in Sec. III and summarised in Tab. I. The distribution of the total electron energy and of the angle between the two electron tracks are shown in Fig. 6. The MC model at the best fit normalisation is compared to the data with a \u03c7 2 test, which provide \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 17.8/17 for the total electron energy distribution and \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 29.4/24 for the angular distribution. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay proceeds through the J \u03c0 = 1 + states of the intermediate nucleus via virtual \u03b2 transitions which occur in two steps. The first step involves transitions connecting the ground state of the initial nucleus with the 1 + states of the intermediate nucleus. The second step involves transitions connecting the intermediate 1 + states to the ground state of the final nucleus. If the two-step process runs exclusively through the first 1 + state, the process is said to be single-state dominated (SSD) [32]. On the other hand, if the two step process runs through higher excited states, the process is said to be higher-state dominated (HSD). The subject of nuclear structure interest is whether the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay nuclear matrix element is dominated by contributions through the lowest state of intermediate nucleus or through higher excited states, in particular through states located in Gamow-Teller resonance region. The calculation of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay halflives within the SSD approach indicate the importance of this assumption [33]. In [34,35] it was suggested that this issue can be studied by comparing measured differential characteristics with those calculated within the SSD and the HSD assumptions. In particular the single electron energy, an observable available in NEMO-3, is expected to discriminate the two hypotheses. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd has been found suitable for such an analysis due to a significant dependence of the SSD differential characteristics on the lepton energies in energy denominators [35]. Two MC samples are produced, each using one of the above models, and compared to the 2e \u2212 sample. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and \u03c7 2 tests are performed on the single electron energy distribution shown in Fig. 7 under both hypotheses. In the SSD (HSD) hypothesis the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is 0.990 (0.726) while the p-value of the \u03c7 2 test is 0.193 (0.004). The results of the tests are in favour of the SSD hypothesis but there is not enough sensitivity to exclude the HSD hypothesis. The number of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 events obtained from the likelihood fit is N 2\u03bd = (4968 \u00b1 74) for the SSD hypothesis and N 2\u03bd = (4966 \u00b1 74) for the HSD hypothesis, while the total number of background events is N b = (402 \u00b1 19). The number of signal events over the number of total background events is S/B 12 with the external background and the 234m Pa from the source foil being the most dominant contributions. The signal selection efficiency estimated from the MC is = (1.8 \u00b1 0.1) % for the SSD hypothesis and = (1.9 \u00b1 0.1) % for the HSD hypothesis. The half-life of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is given by:",

            "text": "where N A is the Avogadro number, W is the atomic weight of 116 Cd, M is the total mass of 116 Cd in NEMO-3 and t is the total exposure time. Apart from the statistical uncertainties of the available data sample, the measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life is subjected to different sources of systematic uncertainties related to the detector response, the modelling of the 116 Cd source and the measurement of the backgrounds. The uncertainty on the 2e \u2212 reconstruction efficiency is estimated using dedicated runs with two calibrated 207 Bi sources. The two conversion electrons emitted by the 207 Bi sources are selected with the same criteria adopted for the 2e \u2212 channel, except that the common vertex of the two electron tracks must originate from the calibration sources. The reconstructed 207 Bi activities agree with the nominal values within 5.5 % which is assumed as the systematic uncertainty on the detection efficiency and directly propagated to the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life. The mass of 116 Cd in NEMO-3 is known within 0.25 % and it also propagates directly to the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life. The systematic uncertainty due to the Monte Carlo modelling of the composition and geometry of the 116 Cd source foils is taken into account measuring the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay halflife in the medium and low background region of the foil separately. The uncertainty is quoted from the relative difference, with respect to the half-life obtained in the simultaneous fit, which is +2.2 % for the medium and \u22123.2 % for the low background region. The calorimeter energy scale is known to \u00b11 % from periodic surveys of the calorimeter response performed during the life time of the detector with in-situ calibration systems. This effect translates into a \u00b11.2 % uncertainty on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life. The difference between the activities measured in the 1e1\u03b1 and 1e1\u03b3 channels are assumed as systematic uncertainty for the 214 Bi and 222 Rn backgrounds. The impact on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life is of \u00b10.01 % and \u00b10.07 % for the 214 Bi and 222 Rn respectively. The systematic uncertainty on the 208 Tl background is estimated measuring a calibrated 232 U source with events containing one electron and two \u03b3s. A discrepancy of 10 % is observed, which translates to \u00b10.05 % on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life. The systematic uncertainty on the components of the internal background, 40 K, 234m Pa and 210 Bi is estimated in the 2e \u2212 channel, by allowing these contributions to float freely in the likelihood fit. The deviation observed on the activities of the internal background is \u00b135 %, but the impact on the total number of background events observed remains small. The effect on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life is \u00b11.1 %. The systematic uncertainty for the external background is 15 %, obtained from the difference observed between the measurement of the external background in the 116 Cd sector and the results from [29]. The effect on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life is \u00b10.45 %. The different sources of systematic uncertainties discussed in the text are summarised in Tab. II. The total systematic uncertainty on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life is obtained by summing in quadrature the different contributions and is found to be +6.2 % and \u22126.7 %. Given the isotope mass and detector exposure of Sec. II, the half-life for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd is, Cd measured in this work with respect to previous measurement from Aurora [17], Solotvina [16], NEMO-2 [15] and ELEGANT-V [11]. The black bars show the statistical uncertainty while the coloured bars shows the total statistical and systematical error combined in quadrature.",

            "text": "The 2e \u2212 selection described in Sec. IV is used to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays of 116 Cd to the ground state of 116 Sn. Different mechanisms expected to produce 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay are investigated. The 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay through the exchange of a light Majorana neutrino, also referred to as the mass mechanism, is the favoured mechanism. The half-life of the decay is related to an effective neutrino mass through Eq. 1. The experimental signature is a peak in the distribution of the total energy of the two electrons near the Q \u03b2\u03b2 value, which for 116 Cd is (2813.50 \u00b1 0.13) keV [10]. The two electrons from the light Majorana neutrino exchange are expected to be selected with an efficiency of (8.17 \u00b1 0.01) %, as estimated from MC simulations. Within R-parity violating supersymmetric models, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 could proceed through the exchange of a gluino or neutralino [36]. To a good approximation the decay kinematics are the same as in the case of the mass mechanism. In left-right symmetric models, the existence of right-handed weak currents allows the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to occur without the helicity flip required by the mass mechanism [28]. In these models, the amplitude of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay does not depend only on the effective neutrino mass but more generally on the coupling between left-handed quarks and right-handed leptons \u03b7 and on the coupling between right-handed quarks and right-handed leptons \u03bb . Even though these modes provide a total energy distributions peaked at the Q \u03b2\u03b2 , the individual electron kinematics differ from those of the electrons emitted for the mass mechanism. The different kinematics provide a different signal selection efficiency of (7.51 \u00b1 0.01) % and (4.16 \u00b1 0.01) % for the \u03b7 and \u03bb terms respectively, as estimated from the MC simulation. The lower signal efficiency observed for these models with respect to the mass mechanism is due to smaller opening angle among the two electron tracks. The \u03bb is further suppressed by a significant asymmetry expected between the energies of the electrons. Finally, 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 might also proceed via the emission of one or more majorons, weakly interacting bosons present in many GUT theories [37]. Since the available energy is shared among three or four particles, the signal signature does not correspond to a peak at the Q \u03b2\u03b2 but rather to a continuous spectrum. The spectral shape for majoron emission depends on a spectral index n. Decays with larger n have broader summed energy peaked at lower values and are thus more difficult to disentangle from the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay and other backgrounds. Given the relatively low statistics and high level of background at low energies, this work considers only the emission of one majoron with spectral index n = 1 which provides a signal selection efficiency of (5.55 \u00b1 0.01) % as estimated from MC simulation. While 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay might result from the interference of several mechanisms, in this work they are investigated separately assuming no interference. The unique feature of NEMO-3 among competing techniques is the capability of reconstructing the full topology of the final state in each event. This capability might allow one to distinguish between the various underlying 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay mechanisms. Furthermore, the separation between signal and background can be enhanced by the combination of various observables and hence improve the sensitivity to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. The different kinematical variables measured by NEMO-3 are combined into a multi-variate analysis using the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) implemented in the TMVA package [38]. In addition to the total energy (E T ot ), the observables considered to enhance signal and background discrimination with BDT are the higher (E M ax ) and lower (E M in ) electron energies, the asymmetry of the two energies (E Asym ), the track lengths associated to the higher (L M ax ) and lower (L M in ) energy electrons, the opening angle between the two tracks (cos(\u03b8)) and the internal probability distribution (P Int ). Dedicated BDTs are trained for each mechanism using 20 % of the available MC statistics. The remaining 80 % of the MC statistics are used to test the BDTs against over-training and to evaluate the classifier performance. The BDT algorithm returns a score value distributed between \u22121, for background-like events, and +1 for signal-like events. The good agreement between signal selection efficiencies measured on the training and testing samples is a good indication that the BDTs are not over-trained. As expected, the variable E T ot is the most discriminating variable for all mechanisms, with a BDT rankings of about 20 %. Other variables have relatively similar ranking, ranging between 10 % to 15 %. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the output score of the BDT trained for the search of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays via the exchange of a light Majorana neutrino. The data are compared to the expected MC model normalised to the values obtained in Sec. III and IV and summarised in Tab. I. Since no significant excess of data over the expected background is observed, the BDT score distribution is used to set lower limit on the half-life of the decay at 90 % C.L. using the modified frequentist approach of [39]. The systematic uncertainties considered for the measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life are accounted for in the limit setting procedure fluctuating the background and the signal distributions by random scale factors generated according to Gaussian distributions. The median and \u00b11\u03c3 expected lower limits on half-lives for the different lepton number violating mechanisms are shown in Tab. III for the BDT and for the total electron energy distribution considered alone.  ",

Using the NME from [47]  and mq and mg are the squark and the gluino masses. In case of the exchange of a righthanded currents the summed energy spectra do not differ significantly from the light neutrino exchange mode. The different kinematics of the two electrons considered in the BDT however allows one to enhance the signal to background separation and improve the limits with respect to the total electron energy considered alone. The resulting limits on the half-lives are 1.1\u00d710 23 y for the \u03b7 term and 0.6 \u00d7 10 23 y for the \u03bb . Limits on the coupling constants are obtained from the half-life limit using calculations from [48] and correspond to \u03b7 < (2.5 \u2212 11.9) \u00d7 10 \u22128 and \u03bb < (3.6 \u2212 43.0) \u00d7 10 \u22126 . Finally, in the case of a single majoron emission the obtained limit on the half-life of the decay is 8.5 \u00d7 10 21 y. The limit is more than one order of magnitude lower than other mechanisms due to the signal spectral shape which extends to lower energies dominated by background. Using the same NMEs adopted for the light Majorana exchange, the phase space factor from [49,50] and g A = 1.27, the upper limit on the coupling constant with the majoron is g \u03c7 0 < (5.2 \u2212 9.2) \u00d7 10 \u22125 .

The half-life of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay has been measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.74 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b1 0.18(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y in the Single State Dominance hypothesis and T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [2.96 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b1 0.20(syst.)] \u00d7 10 19 y in the Higher State Dominance hypothesis. Thanks to the unique capability of the NEMO-3 detector to fully reconstruct the complete kinematics of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, a dedicated study on the shape of the single electron energy distribution has been performed to discriminate between the SSD and HSD hypothesis. The NEMO-3 data are in favour of SSD but there is not enough sensitivity to exclude the HSD due to the limited statistics. The result of this work represents the most precise measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life of 116 Cd. A search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 116 Cd has been performed in the same dataset. No significant excess of data over the expected background events is observed. The lower limit on the half-life for the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism has been determined to be T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 1.0\u00d710 23 y at the 90 % C.L.. The limit on the half-life corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass m \u03bd < 1.4 \u2212 2.5 eV depending on the NME values considered. Limits have also been set on R-parity violating supersymmetry, right-handed current and majoron emission models. Due to a lower exposure, these limits are about one order of magnitude weaker than word leading best limits obtained on 100 Mo [18], 76 Ge [51], 136 Xe [52] and 130 Te [53]. The result of this work is however competitive with the best limits set for 116 Cd [16,17,54].",
