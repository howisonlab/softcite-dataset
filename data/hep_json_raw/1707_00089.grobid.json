The data were collected by the Belle experiment at the KEKB e + e \u2212 asymmetric-energy collider running at or near the \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances. No significant signal is observed, and we set an upper limit on the branching fraction of B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 ) < 15.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level. The contribution of nonresonant \u039b + c \u2192 K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 decays is found to be consistent with zero, and the corresponding upper limit on its branching fraction is set to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 )NR < 6.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level. We also search for an intermediate hidden-strangeness pentaquark decay P + s \u2192 \u03c6p. We see no evidence for this intermediate decay and set an upper limit on the product branching fraction of B(\u039b + c \u2192 P + s \u03c0 0 ) \u00d7 B(P + s \u2192 \u03c6p) < 8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level. Finally, we measure the branching fraction for the Cabibbo-favored decay \u039b + c \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + p\u03c0 0 ; the result is B(\u039b + c \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + p\u03c0 0 ) = (4.42 \u00b1 0.05 (stat.) \u00b1 0.12 (syst.) \u00b1 0.16 (norm.))%, which is the most precise measurement to date. The story of exotic hadron spectroscopy begins with the discovery of the X(3872) by the Belle collaboration in 2003 [1]. Since then, many exotic XYZ states have been reported by Belle and other experiments [2]. Recent observations of two hidden-charm pentaquark states P + c (4380) and P + c (4450) by the LHCb collaboration in the J/\u03c8p invariant mass spectrum of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8pK \u2212 process [3] raises the question of whether a hiddenstrangeness pentaquark P + s , where the cc pair in P + c is replaced by an ss pair, exists [4][5][6]. The strangeflavor analogue of the P + c discovery channel is the decay \u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 [5,6], shown in Fig. 1 (a)  [7]. The detection of a hidden-strangeness pentaquark could be possible through the \u03c6p invariant mass spectrum within this channel [see Fig. 1 (b)] if the underlying mechanism creating the P + c states also holds for P + s , independent of the flavor [6], and only if the mass of P + s is less than",

However, this structure appears only at the most forward angles, which is not expected for the decay of a resonance [10]. Previously, the decay \u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 has not been studied by any experiment. In this paper, we report a search for this decay using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 915 fb \u22121 collected with the Belle detector [11] recorded at or near the \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 (3.5 on 8.0 GeV) collider [12]. In addition, we search for the nonresonant decay \u039b + c \u2192 K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 and measure the branching fraction of the Cabibbo-favored decay \u039b + c \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + p\u03c0 0 . The Belle detector is described in detail elsewhere [11]. To calculate the detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies and to study background, we use Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events. The MC events are generated uniformly in phase space with EvtGen [13] and JetSet [14]; the detector response is modeled using Geant3 [15]. Final-state radiation is taken into account using the Photos [16] package.",

An electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) cluster not matched to any track is identified as a photon candidate.

The m(K + K \u2212 ) of signal is modeled with a relativistic Breit-Wigner function convolved with a Gaussian resolution function (RBW \u2297 G), with the mass and width of the resonance \u03c6 fixed to their nominal values [17].

The systematic uncertainties for the two cases are essentially identical except for that due to the size of the MC sample used to calculate the reconstruction efficiency.  For the \u039b + c \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + p\u03c0 0 sample, the mass distribution is plotted in Fig. 5. We fit this distribution to obtain the signal yield. We model the signal with a sum of two CB functions having a common mean and the combinatorial background with a linear function. We find 242 039 \u00b1 2342 signal candidates and 472 729 \u00b1 467 background candidates in the \u039b + c signal region. The corresponding signal efficiency is (3.988 \u00b1 0.009)%, obtained from MC simulation. We measure the ratio of branching fractions  The systematic uncertainties on all branching fractions are listed in Table I. The uncertainties due to fixed parameters in the PDF shape are estimated by varying the parameters individually according to their statistical uncertainties. For each variation, the branching fraction is recalculated, and the difference with the nominal value is taken as the systematic uncertainty associated with that parameter. In order to determine the systematic uncertainty due to the m(K + K \u2212 ) PDF of nonresonant K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 , we replace the nonparametric PDF by a fourth-order polynomial and refit the data. For the \u03c6p\u03c0 0 final state, we also try including a separate PDF for an f 0 (980) intermediate state. The differences in the fit results are included as systematic uncertainties. We add all uncertainties in quadrature to obtain the overall uncertainty due to PDF parametrization. The uncertainties due to errors in the calibration factors used to account for small data-MC differences in the signal PDF are evaluated separately but in a similar manner. A systematic uncertainty of \u22121.2% is assigned to account for changes associated with the choice of the m(K + K \u2212 ) range in B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 ). A 2.1% systematic uncertainty is assigned due to the best candidate selection. This is evaluated by analyzing the decay channel \u039b + c \u2192 \u03a3 + \u03c6, which has much higher purity than the signal channels analyzed. We determine this by applying an alternative best candidate selection, i.e., the deviations of the candidate \u03c6 and \u03a3 + masses from their nominal values. The difference in the branching fraction due to the two methods of the best candidate selection is taken as the systematic uncertainty. We assign a 1.5% systematic uncertainty due to \u03c0 0 reconstruction; this is determined from a study of \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decays. Since the branching fractions are measured with respect to the normalization channel \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , which has an identical number of charged tracks, the systematic uncertainty due to differences in tracking performance between signal and normalization modes is negligible. There is a 1.8% systematic uncertainty assigned for the particle identification efficiencies in the \u03c6p\u03c0 0 and nonresonant K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 final states relative to the pK \u2212 \u03c0 + normalization channel. The uncertainty in acceptance due to possible resonance substructure in the decay is found to be negligible. The total of the above systematic uncertainties is calculated as their sum in quadrature. In addition, there is a 3.7% uncertainty due to the branching fraction of the normalization mode. As this large uncertainty does not arise from our analysis and will decrease with future measurements of \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , we quote it separately. In summary, we have searched for the decays \u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 and nonresonant \u039b + c \u2192 K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 . No significant signal is observed for either decay mode and we set 90% C.L. upper limits on their branching fractions, which are B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u03c6p\u03c0 0 ) < 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u039b + c \u2192 K + K \u2212 p\u03c0 0 ) NR < 0.6\u00d710 \u22124 . We see no evidence for a hidden-strangeness pentaquark decay P + s \u2192 \u03c6p and set an upper limit on the product branching fraction of B(\u039b + c \u2192 P + s \u03c0 0 ) \u00d7 B(P + s \u2192 \u03c6p) < 8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% C.L. This limit is a factor of six higher than the product branching fraction measured by LHCb for an analogous hidden-charm pentaquark state: B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 P c (4450) + K \u2212 ) \u00d7 B(P c (4450) + \u2192 J/\u03c8 p) = (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [3]. We also measure B(\u039b + c \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + p\u03c0 0 ) = (4.42 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.16)%.
