The general method is to identify a sample of Z boson decays in which one leg (an electron, muon or \u03c4 ) is very cleanly identified and then find a loosely defined second leg which is consistent with coming from a Z decay. A concrete example is a measure of tracking efficiency for electrons where the 'tag' leg is required to have both a track and an electromagnetic shower and the second 'probe' leg has an electromagnetic shower. The 4-vectors derived from the two legs are required to be consistent with a Z boson decay. The efficiency for track finding can then be estimated from the fraction of probe legs which also have a charged track associated with them. In practice, the kinematic Z boson requirement biases the efficiency measure by a few percent so the efficiencies derived by this method cannot be used directly. Instead the tag-probe method is used to measure differences between data and simulation due to detector effects. The kinematic effects cancel in the data to simulation ratio and can be used to correct simulated distributions on an event by event basis. Reference 9 describes this method in more detail. Similar methods can be used to determine charge-misidentification probabilities and to measure the detailed energy response of the electromagnetic calorimeter at module boundaries. The use of these methods has reduced the systematic uncertainties due to detector efficiency in total cross section measurements below 0.5% and have allowed the calibration of absolute electromagnetic energy scales at the 0.02% level.",

Because the V \u2212 A nature of the decay, the lepton tends to go backwards in the boson frame, thus washing out the effect. In 2007, Bodek et al.. 59 proposed a new method for using a W -mass constraint to determine the neutrino momentum, with two solutions for the longitudinal momentum. Their method depends, to some extent, on theoretical models of W boson production and decay to determine the relative weights for the two neutrino solutions, but allows reconstruction of the W boson rapidity. Both the CDF 60 and D0 61 collaborations have used this technique to make direct measurements of the W boson asymmetry which allows a much more direct estimate of the parton probabilities ratios in Equation 7. Figure 7 shows the CDF and D0 results compared to recent theoretical calculations. The CDF result used 1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity while the later D0 measurement used 9.7 fb \u22121 . The W boson charge asymmetry measurement constrains the PDFs needed for precise modeling of W boson production in order to measure its mass. The experimental uncertainties are smaller than the current PDF uncertainties, and therefore help to constrain the PDFs. ",

The tree-level masses of W and Z boson are directly related to their coupling to the Higgs field's vacuum expectation value v. The term \u2206r contains the radiative corrections, which in the SM are dominated by (i) the running of the electromagnetic coupling due to light-quark loops, (ii) the contribution due to the loop involving top (t) and bottom (b) quarks in the W boson propagator, and (iii) the loops in the W boson propagator involving Higgs bosons. The tb loop contributes to a splitting between the W and Z boson masses because of the large difference in the masses of these quarks due to their different Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field. This difference breaks the \"custodial\" SU (2) symmetry which maintains the tree-level relationship between the W and Z boson masses. The Higgs boson loops also cause a splitting between the W and Z boson masses because of the difference in the W W h and ZZh couplings, the latter arising from the mixing between the T 3 generator of SU (2) L and the U (1) Y generator caused by sin 2 \u03b8 eff = 0.

Furthermore, the QCD dijet background swamps the W boson signal in this channel, both at the online trigger and the offline reconstruction level. On the other hand, the electron and muon decay channels are cleanly identifiable with small backgrounds, and the charged lepton momenta can be measured with sufficient accuracy following detailed calibrations. The disadvantage of the leptonic channels is that the presence of the undetectable neutrino in the two-body decay of the W boson prevents the reconstruction of the invariant mass distribution. Apart from the need for precise calibration of the lepton momentum, many of the other tasks and associated systematic uncertainties stem from the presence of the neutrino. The transverse momentum (p T ) distribution of the leptons have the characteristic feature called Jacobian edge, present in any two-body decay mode, where the distribution rises up to p T \u223c M W /2 and falls rapidly past this value.

Two approaches have been followed. In one approach, the boson p T distribution is measured using Z boson decays to dileptons, where the lepton momenta can be measured well. This measurement is used to constrain the theoretical model that predicts the p T (W ) spectrum. In the second approach, the hadronic activity measured in the event is used to obtain information about p T (W ) on an event-by-event basis. In most of the events, the hadronic activity recoiling against the W boson has small net p T and is fairly difffuse, hence reconstruction of collimated jets is not performed. Instead, an inclusive vector sum of transverse energies over all calorimeter towers (excluding towers containing energy deposits from the charged lepton) yields a measurement of the recoil p T vector (denoted by u T ), and p T (W ) \u2261 \u2212 u T . In this approach, the non-linear response and resolution affecting the u T measurement, including the energy flow from the underlying event (spectator parton interactions) and additional pp collisions (both synchronous and asynchronous with the hard scatter), have to be carefully simulated. A measurement of p T (\u03bd) \u2261 \u2212 p T ( ) \u2212 u T can be deduced by imposing transverse momentum balance.

The CDF electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeter 95,96 uses lead absorber and plastic scintillator with relatively coarse transverse granularity compared to D\u00d8. There is no longitudinal segmentation in the CDF EM calorimeter. Due to emission of bremsstrahlung radiation upstream of the drift chamber, the per-electron energy resolution of the calorimeter cluster (where the bremsstrahlung photons are coalesced with the electron shower) is better compared to the track-based measurement. Therefore the strategy adopted at CDF is to use the distribution of E cal /p track to transfer the tracker calibration to the EM calorimeter by fitting the peak near unity. Electrons from W \u2192 e\u03bd and Z \u2192 ee decays are used for this purpose. A bonus from this strategy is that Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 mass measurements can be performed independently of the M W measurements, and the Z boson mass measurements provide independent confirmation of the calibration strategy by proving consistency with the world-average value. For exploiting the full power of the data, the Z boson mass measurements are subsequently used as additional calibration points. Incidentally, these are the most precise measurements of the Z boson mass at hadron colliders, though far from being competitive with the LEP measurements.",

CDF has cross-checked photos using horace, 107 where the latter has two modes: an FSR-only mode and an exact O(\u03b1) mode which is interfaced to a photon shower. Furthermore, in the latter mode all photons in the multi-photon shower have a correction factor applied, which is extracted from the comparison between the first photon in the shower and the photon in the exact O(\u03b1) calculation.

Current measurements from CDF and D\u00d8 have been obtained from the analysis of about a quarter and a half respectively of their full Run 2 dataset. The analyses of the remainder of the data to obtain the final, most precise Tevatron measurements of M W are in progress. The dominant, correlated uncertainty between both experiments will be due to the PDFs.

The uncertainty in the prediction of \u0393 W is dominated by the uncertainty in the experimental value of M W used as input, followed by the uncertainty due to higher-order radiative corrections. New physics may enter through \u03b4 EW . The most recent direct measurements of \u0393 W have been published by CDF 108 and D\u00d8 109 using 350 pb \u22121 and 1 fb \u22121 respectively of integrated luminosity at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The analysis techniques are very similar to those used for the measurements of M W , but with an emphasis on understanding the kinematic region of large transverse mass, 90 < m T < 200 GeV. As this m T -range is higher than the resonant production of W bosons, events in this range are dominated by their off-shell production whose rate depends on \u0393 W . As a result, resolution smearing of events from the resonant region into the high-mass tail of the m T distribution is a more important issue for the \u0393 W analysis, as are the relatively higher background fractions. The PDF uncertainty is also larger due to the wider fit range. The latest measurement from CDF is 108 \u0393 W = 2032 \u00b1 45 stat \u00b1 57 syst = 2032 \u00b1 73 MeV and from D\u00d8 is 109 \u0393 W = 2028 \u00b1 39 stat \u00b1 61 syst = 2028 \u00b1 72 MeV.

The s-channel contributes the diboson production via direct interaction of gauge bosons through trilinear gauge boson vertices. Both the CDF and D0 experiments developed extensive diboson research programs as more and more data were available to analyze. Precise knowledge of diboson processes and their proper modeling is highly valuable for various studies. Many diboson processes represent non-negligible backgrounds in Higgs boson and top quark production, and production of supersymmetric particles. Therefore a complete and detailed understanding of electroweak processes is a mandatory precondition for early discoveries of very small new physics signals.

The proper modeling of diboson production processes was also important in the context of searches for New Physics and searches for the SM Higgs boson at the Tevatron. Table 2 summarizes the theoretical NLO cross sections for diboson production at the Tevatron used in the analyses. The diboson process with the highest production cross section, W \u03b3, has been studied at the Tevatron since the first data were ready for analysis. Samples of 0.20 fb \u22121 and 0.16 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by CDF and D0 respectively, confirmed the agreement between the experiment and theoretical predictions. 128,129 The cross section was measured with a precision of \u223c15% within a phase space defined by E \u03b3 T > 7 or 8 GeV and dR ,\u03b3 > 0.7. In following years the radiation amplitude zero was of great interest when studying this process. This effect, evident in the charge-signed lepton-photon rapidity difference as a dip around -0.3 shown in Figure 15, is a consequence of negative interference among the tree-level diagrams for which the amplitude for SM W \u03b3 production is expected to be zero around cos\u03b8 = \u22120.3 (\u03b8 is an opening angle between incoming quark and outgoing W boson). The most precise measurement of W \u03b3 production cross section at the Tevatron yields \u03c3 W \u03b3 \u00d7 BR(W \u2192 \u03bd) = 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 (stat) \u00b10.6 (syst) pb as obtained from D0 data of 4.2 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. 130 Another channel with a photon in the final state, Z\u03b3, was extensively studied by both collaborations. 128,[131][132][133][134][135] The \u03b3 candidates selection is largely optimized   based on the structure shown in Figure 16 (left) where the invariant mass of the dilepton pair and photon versus the dilepton invariant mass is shown. The vertically populated region is a target group because it represents decays where M \u2248 M Z and a photon is emitted by one of the interacting partons resulting in M \u03b3 > M Z . Over the years improvements that were introduced into analyses of \u03b3 final states such as track isolation, photon identification efficiency, and improved modeling of converted photons helped in reaching a precision in the cross section measurement of 5-6%. The most precise measurement of Z\u03b3 production cross section in \u03b3 final states is reported by the D0 collaboration. 135 The same study investigates the differential distribution d\u03c3/dp \u03b3 T in \u03b3 final states, shown in Figure 16 (right) and confirms the agreement between the theoretical prediction for NLO calculations with MCFM.",

            "text": "The first observation of Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 final states at the Tevatron in 2009 with a statistical significance of 5.1 s.d. yields the most precise cross section times branching ratio measurement of \u03c3 Z\u03b3 \u00d7 BR(Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) = 32 \u00b1 9 (stat+syst) \u00b12 (lumi) fb using 3.6 fb \u22121 of D0 data. As the process with the smallest production cross section but a negligible amount of background, ZZ production was first observed at the Tevatron in 2008 through final states in 1.7 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector. 136 Three events found in data yielded a significance of 5.3 s.d.. Several months earlier CDF reported the first evidence for ZZ \u2192 production with a significance of 4.4 s.d. 137 based on the same number of events selected from 1.9 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. Updated D0 analysis of final states improved precision of a cross section measurement and provided a significant statistics to study various kinematic distributions. 138 This electroweak process is a main background for Higgs boson production H \u2192 ZZ * . In particular the \u03c6 decay distribution shown in Figure 17 is sensitive to different beyond the SM models. 139,140 ZZ production in \u03bd\u03bd final states was studied by both CDF and D0 using 5.9 fb \u22121 and 8.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, respectively. The precision of these measurements (about \u223c 30% with the statistical uncertainty dominating) has been maximized by employing neural network (NN) discriminants to separate the ZZ contribution from the dominant Drell-Yan background at CDF 141 ( Figure 18) and by canceling out some systematic effects when calculating the cross section at D0. 142 Previous measurement in \u03bd\u03bd final states at D0 yielded a significance of 2.6 s.d. using 2.7 fb \u22121 of data. 143 The most precise combined cross sections from CDF and D0 are \u03c3(pp \u2192 ZZ) = 1.64 +0.44 \u22120.38 (stat+syst) pb and \u03c3(pp \u2192 ZZ) = 1.44 +0.35 \u22120.34 (stat+syst) pb, respectively, after corrections for contribution from \u03b3 * and Z/\u03b3 * interference. Similar measurements were also performed with a full datasets collected by the CDF and D0 detectors. 140,144  At the Tevatron W W and W Z production in fully leptonic final states is measured with a precision of 15 \u2212 20%. To achieve the best possible precision experiments employ complex selection criteria and sophisticated analysis techniques. At both Tevatron experiments the W W and W Z cross sections are extracted based on the number of selected events. [145][146][147][148][149][150][151] The first observation of W Z production comes from CDF and yields the cross section of \u03c3 W Z = 5.0 +1.8 \u22121.4 (stat) \u00b10.4 (syst) pb. In addition to that CDF uses NN output and a matrix element likelihood ratio to fit W W , W Z, and background to data. 152,153 The most precise measurements of these processes at the Tevatron are \u03c3 W W = 12.1 \u00b1 0.9 (stat) +1.6 \u22121.4 (syst) pb made by CDF and \u03c3 W Z = 4.50 \u00b1 0.61 (stat) +0. 16 \u22120.25 (syst) pb by D0. As the sensitivity to associated Higgs boson production was growing, efforts expanded to identify events in which one of the vector bosons decays hadronically. The production of a W boson that decays leptonically, associated with a second vector boson V (V = W or Z) that decays into pair of jets involves the same final states with a dijet resonance near the Higgs mass. The first observation of the dijet final states, associated with a large missing transverse energy (MET), was made by CDF with a significance of 5.3 s.d. 154 The dijet mass dis-tribution for the dijet+MET analysis is shown in Figure 19 (left). Because these final states include invisible decays as well, further efforts were made to identify \u03bdjj final states specifically. The first evidence for W W + W Z production in \u03bdjj final states from D0 with 4.4 s.d. significance 155 was followed by its observation at the Tevatron experiments. [156][157][158] Both collaborations used the dijet mass spectra along with sophisticated analysis techniques such as Random Forest and matrix element technique to extract the diboson signal and to measure precisely the cross section, reporting results of \u03c3 W W +W Z = 16.0 \u00b1 3.3 (stat+syst) pb (CDF) and \u03c3 W W +W Z = 19.6 +3.2 \u22123.0 (stat+syst) pb (D0). In addition, both collaborations exploited b-tagging algorithm to further separate W W from W Z contributions. 158,159 The two-dimensional representation of measured W W and W Z production cross section at D0 is shown in Figure 19 (right). The D0 results from the simultaneous fit of \u03c3 W W and \u03c3 W Z using the Random Forest output distributions. The plot shows the best fit value with 68% and 95% C.L. regions and the NLO SM prediction ( Table 2).",

Anomalous effects were also studied in \u03bd events from W Z production. 153 The Z boson p T distribution p Z T , is used to set the 95% C.L. limits of \u22120.39 < \u2206\u03ba Z < 0.90, \u22120.08 < \u03bb < 0.10 and \u22120.08 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.20 for \u039b = 2 TeV. Significant sensitivity to neutral TGCs h 3 and h 4 is achieved by using both Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 final states and optimizing the E \u03b3 T cut-off values. 174 These were determined to be E \u03b3 T > 50 GeV and E \u03b3 T > 100 GeV for the \u03b3 and \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 final states, respectively. Selected E \u03b3 T distributions for both final states are shown in Figure 22 where data is compared to the SM and predictions in the presence of anomalous TGCs. The one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits on h \u03b3,Z 3,4 at \u039b = 1.5 TeV are \u22120.017 < h Z,\u03b3 3 < 0.016, \u22120.0006 < h Z 4 < 0.0005 and |h \u03b3 4 | < 0.0006 and were the best limits on h 3 and h 4 at the time obtained from combination of two final states. The only combined study of anomalous charged TGCs at the CDF experiments in Run II was performed on a data sample of 0.35 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. 175 The combined final states are W W + W Z \u2192 \u03bdjj and W \u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b3 128 with p W/Z\u2192jj T and p \u03b3 T distributions used to set the one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits of \u22120.46 < \u2206\u03ba < 0.39, \u22120.18 < \u03bb < 0.17 at \u039b = 1.5 TeV.

Since the very beginning of the Tevatron Run II data taking period the final states with a photon produced in association with W or Z boson were studied in great detail. The W \u03b3 production in \u03bd\u03b3 final states was regularly tested, first in 0.16 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity 129 and later with 0.7 fb \u22121176 and 4.2 fb \u22121 . 130 These analyses applied somewhat different selection criteria but eventually most of the sensitivity to the anomalous TGCs was statistically driven. The \u03bd\u03b3 final state is of particular importance because it tests only the \u03b3W W vertex and thus can be studied independently of the ZW W vertex, unlike W W interactions. The photon E T spectra for candidate events were used to probe data for the presence of anomalous TGCs, \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 and \u03bb. The one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits on anomalous TGCs set in data corresponding to 4.2 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity are -0.4 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 < 0.4 and -0.08 < \u03bb < 0.07 for \u039b = 2 TeV. 130 Anomalous effects in Z\u03b3 events have been also regularly tested at the D0 experiment. The \u03b3 and \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 final states were analyzed and treated individually, then combined to set the limits on h \u03b3,Z 3,4 TGCs. Only the 0.30 fb \u22121 analysis probed h \u03b3,Z",

            "text": "TGCs utilizing \u03b3 events. 132 Later on, limits on these TGCs were not derived as there was not significant sensitivity to those couplings. The first anomalous TGC analysis to use \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 final states used 3.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. 134 The tight- est D0 limits on h \u03b3,Z 3,4 TGCs describing the \u03b3Z\u03b3 and ZZ\u03b3 vertices are derived from combining previous measurements with the results from 6.2 fb \u22121135 of integrated luminosity in \u03b3 final states. The unfolded differential cross section for Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 production as a function of a photon p \u03b3 T , d(\u03c3 \u00d7 BR)/dp T , shown in Figure 23, has been used to probe neutral TGCs. After combining these with previous limits from 1.0 fb \u22121 Run II data 133 for \u03b3 and 3.6 fb \u22121 of Run II data 134 for \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3, the onedimensional 95% C.L. limits were set at |h \u03b3 30 | < 0.027, |h Z 30 | < 0.026, |h \u03b3 40 | < 0.0014 and |h Z 40 | < 0.0013 for \u039b = 1.5 TeV. The only time when the D0 experiment probed ZZZ and \u03b3ZZ vertices in ZZ production and set limits on f \u03b3,Z 40,50 TGCs only one data event, consistent with the SM prediction, was selected from 1.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. 177 Due to insufficient statistics the number of events expected for each choice of anomalous couplings was used to form a likelihood for that point. The W W Z vertex can be probed for anomalous TGC contributions independently of the W W \u03b3 vertex in W Z \u2192 \u03bd production. Although the production cross section for these fully leptonic final states is relatively small they have very little background contamination, making them specially sensitive to \u2206\u03ba Z and g Z 1 TGCs. In the first iteration of this analysis only 3 events were selected from a 0.30 fb \u22121 dataset. 178 Due to the low statistics the production cross section has been used to set the limits on anomalous TGCs. The lack of shape information from the Z boson p T distribution reduced the sensitivity to anomalous effects. This issue was overcome as the dataset grew. The one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits on the coupling parameters were obtained without any coupling relation and with the HISZ parameterization at \u039b = 2.0 TeV exploiting the p Z T lineshape. 151 The former scenario gives  limits of -0.376 < \u2206\u03ba Z < 0.686, -0.075 < \u03bb < 0.093 and -0.053 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.156 while the latter gives -0.027 < \u2206\u03ba Z < 0.080 and -0.075 < \u03bb < 0.093. The \"LEP parameterization\" relation was imposed when setting limits in 8.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. 179 The corresponding Z boson p T shown in Figure 24 yields limits of -0.077 < \u03bb < 0.089 and -0.055 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.117. The interference between the ZW W and \u03b3W W vertices in W W production allows relating the TGCs via the \"LEP parameterization\" as given by Eq. (16). The first analysis in \u03bd \u03bd final states 180 performed with a 0.25 fb \u22121 dataset was superseded when 100 \u03bd \u03bd events were selected from 1.1 fb \u22121 and when, instead of the leading p T lepton distribution, both the leading and trailing p T lepton distributions, shown in Figure 25, were used to set the limits. 148 The one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits for \u039b = 2 TeV are \u22120.54 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 < 0.83, \u22120.14 < \u03bb < 0.18 and \u22120.14 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.30 under the \"LEP parameterization\" constraints, and \u22120.12 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 = \u2206\u03ba Z < 0.35 and \u22120.14 < \u03bb < 0.18 under the assumption that \u03b3W W and ZW W couplings are equal.  The final state most sensitive to anomalous TGC effects, W W/W Z \u2192 \u03bdjj, has been also studied by the D0 experiment. 179,181 The dijet p T spectrum for data selected from 4.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity and Monte Carlo predictions are shown in Figure 26. This analysis extends the previous cross section analysis 155 with an additional selection of events with the dijet mass between 55 and 110 GeV to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects. Although this final state is heavily contaminated by W +jets and other processes the full reconstruction of the W boson, high energy tail and high W W + W Z \u2192 \u03bdjj statistics significantly boost the sensitivity to \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 , \u03bb and \u2206g Z 1 couplings relative to fully leptonic final states. The one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits for \u039b = 2 TeV are \u22120.27 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 < 0.37, \u22120.075 < \u03bb < 0.080 and \u22120.071 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.137 assuming the \"LEP parameterization\".  Combining with previous analyses in \u03bd\u03b3, \u03bd \u03bd and \u03bd final states resulted in the most stringent limits on \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 , \u03bb and \u2206g Z 1 couplings at a hadron collider to that date. These one-dimensional 95% C.L. limits are presented in Table 3 and two-dimensional limits in Figure 27 for three different planes, \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 \u2212\u03bb (a), \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 \u2212\u2206g Z 1 (b) and \u2206g Z 1 \u2212\u03bb (c). Table 3 also presents 68% and 95% C.L. limits on the W boson magnetic dipole moment, \u00b5 W , and electric quadrupole moment, q W , extracted from combined TGC limits assuming the LEP parameterization with g Z 1 = 1. The quantities \u00b5 W and q W are related to the coupling parameters by:",
