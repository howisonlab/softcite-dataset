In particular, neutral kaons from \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L are produced in pairs and the detection of a K S (K L ) tags the presence of a K L (K S ). This allows to perform precise measurements of kaon properties by means of KLOE detector. Another advantage of a \u03c6-factory consists in fact that the neutral kaon pairs are produced in a pure quantum state (J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 ), which allows to investigate CP and CPT symmetries via quantum interference effects, as well as the basic principles of quantum mechanics.",

The detector itself consists of two main components: a \u223c3.3 m long cylindrical drift chamber [4] with radius \u223c4 m surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter [5]. Both sub-detectors are inserted in a superconducting coil which produces an axial magnetic field of 0.52 T parallel to the beam axis. Fig. 2 shows a schematic view of KLOE detector. The KLOE drift chamber was designed to detect a sizable fraction of K L decays (mean decay path of K L meson is \u223c3.4 m). The chamber is filled with a mixture of helium and isobutan (90% and 10%, respectively) and has about 52000 wires arranged in cylindrical layers with alternate stereo angles. Based on the reconstruction of charged track curvature it allows for a fractional momentum accuracy of \u03c3 p /p \u2248 0.5%. The resolution of vertex reconstruction is about 1 mm, while overall spatial accuracy is below 2 mm. An electromagnetic calorimeter consists of a barrel and side detectors (endcaps) providing almost 4\u03c0 coverage of solid angle. Each module of calorimeter is read out on both sides by set of photomultipliers. It is build of stack of 1 mm scintillating fiber layers glued between grooved lead foils. The obtained accuracy of energy and time measurement are \u03c3 E = 5.7%/ \u221a E[GeV] and \u03c3(t) = 54ps/ \u221a E[GeV] \u2295 100ps, respectively. Determination of the hit position in the plane transverse to the fiber direction is based on the analysis of signal amplitude distribution and the resolution is about 1 cm, while accuracy of longitudinal coordinate due to excellent time resolution amounts to \u03c3 z = 1.2cm/ \u221a E [GeV]. Since at KLOE kaons are produced in pairs from \u03c6 decay, reconstruction of K S decay close to interaction region (clean selection of K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , BR=69%) allows for tagging of K L presence. Having that and taking into account size of the detector itself makes KLOE an excellent place for K L decay measurements. However, what is even more important, detection of K L hit in calorimeter module tags the presence of K S . This method makes KLOE an unique place to study pure K S beams. It is used for measurement of BR(K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) described in Section 2. It is also possible to study decays of both kaons in single event. Since both of them are produced in a pure quantum state (J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 ), it is possible to study quantum interference effects for reaction K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , as it is shown in Section 3.",

            "text": "The decay K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 has not been observed so far. Up to now the best limit of branching ratio is 1.2 \u2022 10 \u22127 [7], which is still about two orders of magnitude larger than theoretical predictions based on Standard Model (BR S M \u223c1.9\u202210 \u22129 ). Assuming the CPT invariance the described process allows for investigation of direct CP violation. At KLOE presence of K S is tagged by K L interaction with electromagnetic calorimeter (K L -crash). Additional condition to select K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay candidates are presence of six neutral clusters (caused by gamma pairs from \u03c0 0 decays) and no charged tracks originating from interaction point. There are two main components for background reaction. Events of K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 where two additional clusters are from splitting or accidental processes and K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events. In the second case the K L decay close to the interaction point mimics the K S decay, while charged products of K S due to interaction with quadrupoles simulate K L -crash signal. As a first step for background reduction a kinematic fit was performed with 11 constrains of energy and momentum conservation, the kaon mass and velocity of six photons. Cut on obtained \u03c7 2 values effectively reduce the background from false K L -crash events without loose of signal events. For the rejection of events with splitted and/or accidental clusters a correlation between \u03c7 2 3\u03c0 and \u03c7 2 2\u03c0 variables was used. Both variables are evaluated with the most favorable cluster pairing in each case [7]. The quadratic sum of residuals between the \u03c0 0 mass and the invariant masses of three photon pairs formed from the six clusters is \u03c7 2 3\u03c0 , while \u03c7 2 2\u03c0 is based on the invariant masses of two photon pairs and energy and momentum conservation for \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L reaction, where K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . In addition, to improve the quality of the photon selection, a cut on \u2206E = (m \u03a6 /2 \u2212 E \u03b3 i )/\u03c3 E was applied, where \u03b3 i stands for the i-th photon from four chosen in the \u03c7 2 2\u03c0 estimator and \u03c3 E is the appropriate resolution. For two background clusters case \u2206E is expected to be 0, while \u2206E \u2248 m \u03c0 0 /\u03c3 E for K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 . Final cut was also applied on the minimal distance between photon clusters to refine rejection of events with splitted clusters. Result of this cut is shown in Fig. 3. After preliminary cuts zero candidate events were obtained and zero events from Monte Carlo were observed. Data sample is based on 1.7 fb \u22121 integrated luminosity, while effective statistics of Monte Carlo is two times higher than data sample. This results in a new preliminary upper limit on branching ratio BR(K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ) < 2.9 \u202210 \u22128 (corresponding to |\u03b7 3\u03c0 0 | = A(K S \u21923\u03c0 0 )",
