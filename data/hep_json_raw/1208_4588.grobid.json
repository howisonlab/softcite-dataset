The three-jet rate as a function of the transition parameter y cut is determined using the Durham jet algorithm and the distribution is compared to QCD predictions. Recent theoretical calculations predict the three-jet rate at next-to-next-to-leading order. For the first time a measurement of \u03b1 S is presented using QCD predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order matched to predictions at next-to-leading logarithmic approximation, with subleading terms being included as well. We obtain \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1199 \u00b1 0.0010(stat.) \u00b1 0.0021(exp.) \u00b1 0.0054(had.) \u00b1 0.0007(theo.), being consistent with the world average value of \u03b1 S .",

Several possibilities exist to determine this parameter, one method being presented in this paper. In e + e \u2212annihilation with quarks in the final state hard gluons can be emitted from the quark with the emission probability being proportional to the strong coupling \u03b1 S . Events with a hard gluon are identified by observing at least three particle jets in the detector. The theory of strong interaction, Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD), allows to predict the rate of three-jet events as a function of a single parameter, the strong coupling \u03b1 S . Recent theoretical improvements [1][2][3][4] allow to calculate the three-jet rate at next-to-next-to-leading-oder (NNLO) and a first measurement with data collected by the ALEPH detector at 91 GeV using the three-jet rate at a single resolution parameter was published [5].",

Several clustering schemes are available and we use the Durham clustering algorithm [7]. The number of jets depends on the resolution parameter y cut , a measure indicating the separation between the second and the third reconstructed jet. The fixed order prediction of the three-jet rate determined with the Durham clustering scheme is matched to NLLA predictions using the R-matching scheme. Parts of the subleading soft logarithms, which are not included in the NLLA calculations, can be systematically controlled and included by adding a renormalisation scheme dependent K-term [8]. Including the K-term significantly improves the description of the data. QCD predictions of the three-jet rate, without the expected contribution from hadronisation effects, are shown in Fig. 1. ",

The number of selected hadronic events ranges between about 1000 events at 14 GeV and 20000 events at 35 GeV. The selection of hadronic events is based on the event multiplicity, momentum imbalance and on the total visible energy. The events are corrected for acceptance effects and the QCD predictions for the hadronisation of partons to hadrons. For these correction procedures Monte Carlo (MC) samples generated with PYTHIA, HERWIG or ARIADNE are used, with the generators being tuned to events taken with the OPAL detector at LEP at a centre-of-mass energy of 91 GeV. The expected contribution from e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb-events, as predicted by simulation, is subtracted from the observed three-jet rate.

The fit range is determined by requiring the correction from hadronisation and detector effects to be small.

For this measurement hadronic events from e + e \u2212 -annihilation taken at centre-of-mass energies between 14 and 44 GeV are used. The result \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1199 \u00b1 0.0010(stat.) \u00b1 0.0021(exp.) \u00b1 0.0054(had.) \u00b1 0.0007(theo.) is consistent with the world average value. The largest uncertainty originates from modeling the transition from parton level, as predicted from the perturbative QCD calculations, to the hadron level, as observed by the experiment. The increased precision of perturbative QCD predictions, together with large hadronic e + e \u2212 event samples, will allow to scrutinize MC generators modeling the transition from partons to hadrons. A measurements of \u03b1 S using fixed order predictions only cannot describe the data satisfactorily. A fit leaving \u03b1 S as well as x \u00b5 free returns a good description of the data, but the fitted value of x \u00b5 is inconsistent with one. Fig. 5 summarizes the result obtained here to previous analyses using jet rates and differential jet rates. The value obtained for \u03b1 S using a fit to the y 23 distribution returns the almost identical result for \u03b1 S as measured with this analysis. The measurements obtained at higher centre-of-mass energies return smaller uncertainties, since the size of the hadronisation correction decreases with increasing centre-of-mass energy. The measurement of \u03b1 S using the four-jet rate and data taken between 14 and 44 GeV returns a smaller hadronisation uncertainty, leading to a decreased overall uncertainty.
