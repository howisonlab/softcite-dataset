In an analysis of muon neutrino disappearance alone, we find the following estimates and 68% confidence intervals for the two possible mass hierarchies: normal hierarchy\u2236 sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.514 \u00fe0.055 \u22120.056 and \u0394m 2 32 \u00bc \u00f02.51 AE 0.10\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 =c 4 and inverted hierarchy\u2236 sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.511 AE 0.055 and \u0394m 2 13 \u00bc \u00f02.48 AE 0.10\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 =c 4 . The analysis accounts for multinucleon mechanisms in neutrino interactions which were found to introduce negligible bias. We describe our first analyses that combine measurements of muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance to estimate four oscillation parameters, j\u0394m 2 j, sin 2 \u03b8 23 , sin 2 \u03b8 13 , \u03b4 CP , and the mass hierarchy. Frequentist and Bayesian intervals are presented for combinations of these parameters, with and without including recent reactor measurements. At 90% confidence level and including reactor measurements, we exclude the region \u03b4 CP \u00bc \u00bd0.15; 0.83\u03c0 for normal hierarchy and \u03b4 CP \u00bc \u00bd\u22120.08; 1.09\u03c0 for inverted hierarchy. The T2K and reactor data weakly favor the normal hierarchy with a Bayes factor of 2.2. The most probable values and 68% one-dimensional credible intervals for the other oscillation parameters, when reactor data are included, are sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.528 \u00fe0.055 \u22120.038 and j\u0394m 2 32 j \u00bc \u00f02.51 AE 0.11\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 =c 4 .",

            "text": "Neutrino oscillation was firmly established in the late 1990s with the observation by the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment that muon neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in our atmosphere changed their flavor [1]. Measurements from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory a few years later, in combination with SK data, revealed that neutrino oscillation was responsible for the apparent deficit of electron neutrinos produced in the Sun [2]. In the most recent major advance, the T2K experiment [3,4] and reactor experiments [5][6][7][8] have established that all three neutrino mass states are mixtures of all three-flavor states, which allows the possibility of CP violation in neutrino oscillation. This paper describes our most recent measurements of neutrino oscillation including our first results from analyses that combine measurements of muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.",

Protons, extracted from the J-PARC main ring, strike a target to produce secondary hadrons, which are focused and subsequently decay in flight to produce an intense neutrino beam, consisting mostly of muon neutrinos. The neutrino beam axis is directed 2.5 degrees away from the SK detector in order to produce a narrow-band 600 MeV flux at the detector, the energy that maximizes muon neutrino oscillation at the 295 km baseline. Detectors located 280 m downstream of the production target measure the properties of the neutrino beam, both on axis (INGRID detector) and off axis in the direction of SK (ND280 detector).",

Summary of the estimated proton beam properties and their systematic errors at the collimator for the T2K Run 4 period. Shown are the mean position (X; Y), angle (X 0 ; Y 0 ), width (\u03c3), emittance (\u03f5), and Twiss parameter (\u03b1) [17]. energy for each neutrino flavor [11]. Table III shows the breakdown for the \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd e flux uncertainties for energy bins near the peak energy. The largest uncertainty from beam monitor calibrations arises in the beam current measurement using a current transformer, but its effect on the oscillation analyses is reduced through the use of near detector data. The remaining uncertainties due to the uncertain position and calibration of the other beam monitors are significantly smaller. As described in Sec. IVA, the neutrino beam direction is determined with the INGRID detector, and therefore the assigned uncertainty on the off-axis angle comes directly from the INGRID beam profile measurement. To account for the horn current measurement that drifts over time and a possible scale uncertainty, 5 kA is assigned as a conservative estimate of the horn current error. In the flux simulation, the horn magnetic field is assumed to have a 1=r dependence. Deviations from this field, measured using a Hall probe, are used to define the uncertainty of the horn field. Horn and target alignment uncertainties come from survey measurements. Systematic uncertainties in modeling particle multiplicities from hadronic interactions come from several sources: experimental uncertainties in the external data, the uncertain scaling to different incident particle momenta and target materials, and extrapolation to regions of particle production phase space not covered by external data [11]. The overall uncertainty is described by calculating the covariance of the pion, kaon, and secondary nucleon multiplicities and their interaction lengths.",

Interactions not modeled in this version of NEUT include, but are not limited to, multinucleon interactions in the nucleus [24,25], and neutrinoelectron scattering processes. The Llewellyn Smith model [26] is used as the basis to describe charged current quasielastic (CCQE) and neutral current elastic scattering interactions. In order to take into account the fact that the target nucleon is in a nucleus, the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model by Smith and Moniz [27,28] is used. The model uses dipole axial form factors and the vector form factors derived from electron scattering experiments [29].

To avoid double counting single pion production with the resonance production described above, in the region W \u2264 2 GeV=c 2 the model includes the probability to produce more than one pion only. For W > 2 GeV=c 2 , NEUT uses PYTHIA/JETSET [35] for hadronization while for W \u2264 2 GeV=c 2 , it uses its own model. Hadrons that are generated in a neutrino-nucleus interaction can interact with the nucleus and these final state interactions (FSI) can affect both the total number of particles observed in a detector and their kinematics. NEUT uses a cascade model for pions, kaons, etas, and nucleons. Though details are slightly different between hadrons, the basic procedure is as follows. The starting point for the cascade model is the neutrino interaction point in the nucleus based on a Woods-Saxon density distribution [36] except in DIS, where a formation zone is taken into account. The hadron is moved a small distance and interaction probabilities for that step are calculated. The interaction types include charge exchange, inelastic scattering, particle production, and absorption. If an interaction has occurred, then the kinematics of the particle are changed as well as the particle type if needed.

The CC coherent pion cross section is assigned an error of 100% due to the fact that the CC coherent pion cross section had only 90% confidence upper limits for sub-GeV neutrino energies at the time of this analysis. In , and addition, when included in the MiniBooNE pion production fits, the data are consistent with the nominal NEUT model at 1\u03c3 and with zero cross section at 2\u03c3. The NC coherent pion production data [76] differ from NEUT by 15%, within the measurement uncertainty of 20%. To account for the difference and the uncertainty, we conservatively assign a 30% overall uncertainty to x NCcoh\u03c0 . The antineutrino/neutrino cross-section ratios are assigned an uncertainty of 40%. This is a conservative estimate derived from doubling the maximum deviation between the energy-dependent MiniBooNE CCQE neutrino cross section and the RFG model assuming an axial mass of M QE A \u00bc 1.03 GeV=c 2 , which was 20%. For \u03bd e CCQE interactions, there may be some effects that are not accounted for in the NEUT model, such as the existence of second class currents, as motivated in Ref. [77]. The dominant source of uncertainty is the vector component, which may be as large as 3% at the T2K beam peak, and thus is assigned as an additional error on \u03bd e CCQE interactions relative to \u03bd \u03bc CCQE interactions. The NCOther category consists of neutral current elastic scattering, NC resonant production where the resonance decays to a nucleon and kaon, eta, or photon, and NCDIS interactions. For fits to the ND280 data and \u03bd e analyses at SK, resonant production that produces a nucleon and charged pion is also included in the NCOther definition, though kept separate in other analyses. NCOther interactions have a 30% normalization error assigned to them, which is given to the parameters x NCOth and x NC1\u03c0 AE .",

An alternative model, referred to as the \"spectral function\" (SF) [79], appears to be a better model when compared to electron scattering data. SF is a generic term for a function that describes the momentum and energy distributions of nucleons in a nucleus. In the model employed in [79], the SF consists of a mean-field term for single particles and a term for correlated pairs of nucleons, which leads to a long tail in the momentum and binding energy. It also includes the nuclear shell structure of oxygen, the main target nucleus in the T2K far detector. The difference between the RFG and SF models is treated with an additional systematic parameter.",

Figure 5 shows the history of the horizontal and vertical neutrino beam directions relative to the nominal directions as measured by INGRID and by the muon monitor.

A 1 mrad change in angle changes the intensity and peak energy of an unoscillated neutrino beam at SK by 3% and 13 MeV, respectively.

To achieve this, the T2K collaboration chose to use a combination of highly segmented scintillator targets and gaseous trackers in a magnetic spectrometer. Segmented active targets allow for the neutrino interaction to be localized and the trajectories of the charged particles to be reconstructed, and those passing through the gaseous trackers have their charge, momentum, and particle type measured. The targets and gaseous trackers are surrounded by a calorimeter to detect photons and assist in particle identification. The refurbished UA1/NOMAD magnet was acquired and its rectangular inner volume led to a design with rectangular subdetectors.

Additional requirements are included to reduce background in which the start of the \u03bc \u2212 candidate is incorrectly assigned inside the FGD1 FV, due to a failure to correctly reconstruct a particle passing through the FGD1 (throughgoing veto). The \u03bc \u2212 candidate is required to be consistent with a muon (muon PID requirement) based on a truncated mean of measurements of energy loss in the TPC gas [85].

This is assessed by looking for missed track components in control samples with particles that pass through all three TPCs. The single track-finding efficiency is determined to be (99.8 \u00fe0.2 \u22120.4 %) for data and simulation for all angles, momenta and track lengths, and shows no dependence on the number of clusters for tracks with 16 clusters or more.

Figures 14-16 show the projected kinematic variable distributions of the three ND280 samples used in this analysis, comparing the data to the MC prediction for the two cases of using nominal values of the systematic parameters and using the best-fit values of the parameters. The MC distributions show better agreement with the data when using the best-fit values for the parameters, especially decreasing the prediction near the momentum peak and in the forward direction (cos \u03b8 \u03bc close to 1). Figure 17 shows the values of the \u03bd \u03bc flux and crosssection parameters that are constrained by the near detector analysis for the oscillation analyses; Table XII lists the flux  parameters and Table XIII lists the values of the crosssection parameters. These tables contain all of the point estimates ing as well as the errors calculated as the square root of the diagonal of the covariance V g . One of the interesting features of the best-fit parameters is the dip in the flux parameters just below 1 GeV, which is near the peak of the T2K beam flux. This is particularly important, as this is the region of interest for oscillation analyses, and an incorrect prediction of the flux in this region can bias estimates of oscillation parameters. Another interesting point is the value of M RES A , which is pulled to a much lower value than the external data constraint used in the fit. This highlights both the power of the ND280 data, and the importance of the CC1\u03c0 \u00fe -like sample, which is dominant in determining this parameter. This selection is new to the ND280 analysis for the set of oscillation analyses reported in this paper, and provides an improved ability to use T2K data to constrain resonant interaction parameters. The predicted event rate at SK is given by the product of the flux, cross section, and detector efficiency, and the typical uncertainties of the flux and cross section parameters constrained by ND280 are 7%-10%. The estimators of these flux and cross-section parameters have a strong negative correlation, however, because they use the rate measurements in the near detector. As a result, their contribution to the SK event rate uncertainty is less than 3%, significantly smaller than the individual flux and crosssection parameter uncertainties.",

Due to their relatively large mass, muons passing through the detector are often unscattered and thereby produce clear ring patterns. Electrons, in contrast, scatter and produce electromagnetic showers, resulting in a diffuse ring edge. These differences in conjunction with estimation of the Cherenkov opening angle enable efficient discrimination between leptons. The probabilities to misidentify a single electron as a muon or a single muon as an electron are 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, for typical lepton energies in T2K events. Since the recoil proton from CC interactions at T2K is usually below Cherenkov threshold, a single lepton is the dominant topology for beam-induced events at SK.

Figure 18 shows the event timing (\u0394T 0 ) distribution for all ID, OD, and LE events within AE500 \u03bcs of the beam arrival time. There is a clear peak near \u0394T 0 \u00bc 0 for the FC sample. Eleven FC events have been observed outside the spill window. Using data collected with no beam we estimate the expected number of these events to be 5.85, mainly low energy events. \u0394T 0 is corrected to take into account the neutrino interaction vertex position and the photon time-offlight from the vertex to the PMTs. FC events within the spill window can be seen in Fig. 19 where the beam structure with eight bunches is clearly visible. The dotted lines represent the fitted bunch center times with a fixed bunch interval of 581 ns. For an event to be incorporated into the analysis, \u0394T 0 must lie between \u22122 to 10 \u03bcs.",

The single electron hypothesis has seven parameters which are the initial vertex position, time, direction, and momentum. Since a \u03c0 0 decays into two \u03b3s and produces two electron-like Cherenkov rings, the \u03c0 0 hypothesis is constructed by combining the charge and time contributions from two electron tracks which point back to a common vertex. In addition to the common vertex and the directions and momenta of the two \u03b3 tracks, each track has an additional free parameter which shifts its origin along its direction in order to account for photon conversion points. The \u03c0 0 hypothesis therefore has twelve parameters. In order to distinguish signal \u03bd e CC events from \u03c0 0 background events, we use the maximum likelihood values of the electron hypothesis L e and the \u03c0 0 hypothesis L \u03c0 0 as well as the reconstructed invariant mass m \u03b3\u03b3 obtained from the \u03c0 0 hypothesis.

We use SKDETSIM [3,9], a GEANT3-derived simulation of the SK detector, to model the propagation of particles produced by neutrino interactions. The GCALOR physics package is used to simulate hadronic interactions in water owing to its ability to reproduce pion interaction data around 1 GeV=c. However for pions with momentum below 500 MeV=c, custom routines are employed based on the cascade model used by NEUT to simulate interactions of final state hadrons. SKDETSIM incorporates the propagation of photons in water, subject to absorption, Rayleigh scattering, and Mie scattering. The simulation of these processes is tuned using laser calibration sources in situ [93]. Control samples that are not related to the T2K beam spills are used to assess systematic uncertainty, including muons and neutrinos produced from cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere (cosmic ray muons and atmospheric neutrinos) and combinations of simulated and cosmic ray data (hybrid-\u03c0 0 sample). As described below, cosmic ray muons are used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty due to the fully-contained (FC), fiducialvolume, and decay-electron requirements. Atmospheric neutrinos are used to assess uncertainty from the ring counting, particle identification, and \u03c0 0 rejection. The hybrid-\u03c0 0 sample is used to study the SK response to \u03c0 0 's. The uncertainties due to energy scale, modeling of pion final state interactions (FSI) and secondary interactions (SI) are evaluated separately.",

The error from the initial FC event selection is 1% and is dominated by the event-by-event flasher rejection cut. The uncertainty in the fiducial volume is estimated to be 1% using the vertex distribution of cosmic ray muons which have been independently determined to have stopped inside the ID. The uncertainty due to the Michel electron tagging efficiency is estimated by comparing cosmic ray stopped-muon data and MC. This uncertainty is applied based on the fraction of events with true Michel electrons in the T2K beam MC. The rate of falsely identified Michel electrons is estimated from MC and 100% uncertainty in that rate is assumed. Overall, the event rate uncertainty related to the decay-electron requirements is small. For the \u03bd e CC candidate sample, it is 0.2% for \u03bd e CC events and 0.4% for \u03bd \u03bc CC and NC events. For the \u03bd \u03bc CC candidate sample it is 1.0%.",

These events are constructed by overlaying one electron-like ring from the SK atmospheric neutrino or cosmic ray muon samples with one simulated photon ring. The simulated photon ring kinematics are chosen such that the momenta and opening angle between the two rings follow the decay kinematics of NC \u03c0 0 events from the T2K MC. Hybrid-\u03c0 0 MC samples with both rings from the SK MC are produced to compare with the hybrid-\u03c0 0 data samples, and the difference in the fractions that pass the \u03bd e selection criteria is used to assign the systematic error. The difference could be due to incorrect modeling of scattered or reflected light from the higher energy ring which obscures the lower energy ring. In order to investigate this, we compare hybrid-\u03c0 0 samples in which the electron constitutes the higher energy ring from the \u03c0 0 decay with hybrid-\u03c0 0 samples in which it constitutes the lower energy ring. For events with additional particles in the final state, we add a MC ring to the existing hybrid-\u03c0 0 samples and assume the dominant source of error comes from the detection of the lower energy photon from the \u03c0 0 decay. Relative uncertainties on the efficiency, calculated for 17 bins in reconstructed electron momentum and angle, are in the range 2%-60%. Relative statistical errors, in the range 15%-50%, are applied assuming no correlation between bins. Neutral-current interactions can produce a final state containing just a single photon via radiative decays of \u0394 resonances (NC 1\u03b3). This is a background in the \u03bd e CC candidate sample because photons and electrons produce very similar charge patterns in the SK detector. The uncertainty in the efficiency of selecting NC 1\u03b3 events is determined by comparing the efficiency of a single photon MC sample with that of a single electron MC. The difference is no more than 1%. This error is added in quadrature to the uncertainty for the CC 1e FS topology described above to give the total uncertainty on the NC 1\u03b3 background in the \u03bd e CC candidate sample.",

The profile likelihood, a function of only the subset of parameters of interest, is the likelihood maximized over the remaining parameters. The marginal likelihood is found by integrating the product of the likelihood function and priors over all parameters, except those of interest. In the case of linear parameter dependence and where the nuisance parameters appear in a Gaussian form, the profile and marginal likelihood functions will be identical and can be used to produce intervals with correct frequentist coverage.

When physical boundaries or nonlinearities appear in the parametrization, as in the case for the oscillation parameters, they can cause confidence intervals to be empty or misleadingly small. In order to reduce the chance of producing such confidence intervals, we use the likelihood ratio recommended by Feldman and Cousins [101] to form the interval. When producing joint intervals for two oscillation parameters, this approach is not always computationally practical, and instead approximate intervals are shown using contours of the likelihood ratio, sometimes referred to as the constant \u0394\u03c7 2 method.",

The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [102] is used to efficiently produce a set of points that populate the full parameter space proportional to the posterior probability density function. The chain is the set of accepted stepping points in a random walk through parameter space, in which a proposed step from point A to a point B with lower density is accepted with a probability equal to the ratio of the densities f\u00f0B\u00de=f\u00f0A\u00de and is always accepted when the density increases. When a step is not accepted, the last point in the chain is repeated, and another random step from that point is proposed. With the chain, consisting typically of millions of points, \u03b1% highest-posterior-density credible intervals [103] are constructed by selecting the region of highest density that contain \u03b1% of all the points. Highest-posterior-density intervals are constructed such that no point in parameter space outside the interval has a higher probability density than any point inside the interval. This is done for one or two parameters of interest, and the values of the remaining parameters are ignored in the process, equivalent to producing a set of points distributed according to the marginalized posterior probability density function.

For the M1 likelihood, f\u00f0E rec \u03bd;i j\u03b8;g;x s ;s\u00de is the probability density of observing an event with reconstructed energy, E rec \u03bd;i , given values for the oscillation and systematic parameters. The value of f\u00f0E rec \u03bd;i j\u03b8;g;x s ;s\u00de is calculated with a linear interpolation between the bins of a histogram of the normalized energy spectrum. For the M2 likelihood, the number of data and predicted events in the j th reconstructed energy bin, N d j and N p j , respectively, are used instead. Both \u03bd \u03bc -disappearance fits consider a total of 48 parameters: 6 oscillation parameters, 16 flux parameters, 20 neutrino interaction parameters and 6 parameters related to the response of SK. In order to find the best-fit values and confidence intervals for sin 2 \u03b8 23 and j\u0394m 2 j, the profiled likelihood is maximized. Separate fits are performed for the different neutrino mass hierarchy assumptions.",

VII C, the Neyman method with the approach recommended by Feldman and Cousins (FC) was used to calculate confidence intervals for the two oscillation parameters, sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 (\u0394m 2 13 ), for the normal (inverted) hierarchy. The constant-\u0394\u03c7 2 method does not provide correct coverage due to the physical boundary near sin 2 2\u03b8 23 \u00bc 1 and because of the nonlinear parametrization. Critical values of the FC statistic were determined on a fine grid of the two oscillation parameters of interest using 10,000 toy data sets at each point. Each toy data set had a set of values of the systematic parameters sampled from a multidimensional Gaussian having means at the nominal values, and covariances V. Each oscillation parameter, sin 2 \u03b8 12 , \u0394m 2 21 , and sin 2 \u03b8 13 , is sampled from a Gaussian with mean and sigma values listed in Sec. VII B. The values of \u03b4 CP are sampled uniformly between \u2212\u03c0 and \u00fe\u03c0. The systematic parameters and these additional oscillation parameters are removed from the likelihood function by profiling. In order to calculate an interval of just one oscillation parameter (sin 2 \u03b8 23 or \u0394m 2 ), we determine the critical values by marginalizing over the second oscillation parameter. The marginalization assumes that the probability is proportional to the likelihood using T2K data. ",

Table XXI summarizes these results from the M1 and M2 analyses. Likewise, the confidence intervals produced by M1 and M2 are similar. Since the M1 and M2 analyses are consistent with each other, only results from M1 are given below. Figure 27 shows the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters, the two-dimensional confidence intervals calculated using the Feldman and Cousins method, assuming normal and inverted hierarchy, and the sensitivity at the current exposure. The size of the confidence interval found by the fit to the data is smaller than the sensitivity. This arises because the best-fit point is at the physical boundary corresponding to maximum disappearance probability. The amount by which the region is smaller is not unusual in an ensemble of toy MC experiments produced under the assumption of maximal disappearance. The best-fit spectrum from the normal hierarchy fit compared to the observed spectrum is shown in Fig. 28, showing as well the ratio of the number of observed events to the predicted number of events with sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0. The observed oscillation dip is significant and well fit by simulation. The calculated one-dimensional Feldman and Cousins confidence intervals are given in Table XXII.

Such processes are known to be important in describing electron-nucleus scattering (for a review, see [130]), but have not yet been included in the model of neutrino-nucleus interactions in our muon neutrino disappearance analyses. If such multinucleon effects are important, their omission could introduce a bias in the oscillation analyses.

            "text": "A Monte Carlo study was performed in order to explore the sensitivity of the analysis to multinucleon effects. The nominal interaction model includes pion-less delta decay (PDD), which can be considered to be a multinucleon effect. As an alternative, we turn off PDD and use a model by Nieves [24] to simulate multinucleon interactions for neutrino energies below 1.5 GeV. Pairs of toy Monte Carlo  experiments including both near and far detector data were generated, one with the nominal and one with the alternative model. Each data set in a pair was produced by using the same distribution of interacting neutrinos, in order to reduce statistical fluctuations in the comparison. Each pair of experiments used a different distribution of interacting neutrinos and a different set of systematic parameters sampled from multivariate Gaussian distributions. The complete analysis with near and far detector data is performed, assuming the nominal model in all cases. In so doing, the study properly accounts for the reduction in sensitivity to mismodeling neutrino interactions when using near detector data to constrain flux and cross-section parameters. The differences in the point estimates for the oscillation parameters for the two samples in each pair are shown in Fig. 30. The overall bias for both is negligible, compared to the precision obtained for the parameters. However, the additional variation in sin 2 \u03b8 23 is about 3%, comparable to the size of other systematic uncertainties. The bias was evaluated at sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u00bc 0.45 to avoid the physical boundary at maximal disappearance which could reduce the size of the apparent bias. For the present exposure, the effect can be ignored, but future analyses will need to incorporate multinucleon effects in their model of neutrino-nucleus interactions.",

The most probable values for the oscillation parameters for both analyses are shown in Table XXV. For the T2K-only analysis, the values are shown for \u03b4 CP \u00bc 0, as the analysis has little sensitivity to the value of \u03b4 CP . The 68% one-dimensional credible intervals, marginalized over all other parameters, including mass hierarchy, for each of the parameters except \u03b4 CP are shown in Table XXVI.

Note that the contours in Fig. 38 are marginalized over the mass hierarchy; in particular, the most probable value line appears to be offset from the center of the credible region. This is because the most probable value line is for the preferred inverted hierarchy, and the credible intervals are marginalized over hierarchy. Fig. 40 shows the posterior probability for \u03b4 CP with 68% and 90% credible intervals for the T2K \u00fe reactor combined analysis. Figure 41 shows comparisons of SK \u03bd \u03bc CC and \u03bd e CC candidate events with the best-fit spectra produced from the T2K-only and T2K \u00fe reactor combined analyses.

The fit spectrum for \u03bd \u03bc CC events does not change appreciably when the reactor prior is included, but the \u03bd e CC fit spectrum shows a noticeable reduction in the number of events. Figures 42 and 43 show the posterior PDFs for the oscillation parameters both singly and pairwise, using MCMC points from the inverted and normal hierarchy, respectively, which reflect the most probable mass hierarchy for the T2K-only and T2K \u00fe reactor analysis, respectively.

Credible regions for sin 2 \u03b8 13 and \u03b4 CP for T2K-only and T2K \u00fe reactor combined analyses. These are constructed by marginalizing over both mass hierarchies. For the T2K-only analysis, the best fit line is shown instead of the best fit point because the analysis has little sensitivity to \u03b4 CP . FIG. 39 (color online). Credible regions for sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394m 2 32 for T2K-only and T2K \u00fe reactor combined analyses. The normal hierarchy corresponds to positive values of \u0394m 2 32 and the inverted hierarchy to negative values.",
