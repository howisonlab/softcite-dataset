The multiplicity distribution is found to be reasonably well explained by a double Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD). The average photon multiplicity increases logarithmically with \u221a s. It is found that none of the models we used (PYTHIA6D6T, PHOJET, and HERWIG) could explain the data.",

A set of proposed signatures provides evidences for the formation of such a system in these collisions. Measurements in pp collisions define a baseline for drawing a definite conclusion in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, measurements of multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions have been reported for charged particles at midrapidity in pp collisions for \u221a s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV by ALICE, CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN-LHC [1,2]. Photon measurements provide complementary information. The majority of photons emitted from the reaction are decay products of produced particles. The multiplicity measurements at forward pseudorapidity represent an additional tool for testing limiting fragmentation (LF) hypothesis which is found to hold at lower energies [3].",

A simple clustering algorithm with a contiguous cell search is employed to find the clusters. The properties of each cluster with regard to the number of cells (cluster N cell ) contained in it and the total energy deposition (ADC) have been obtained. Discrimination between photons and hadrons is made by using a threshold method by putting a cut-off in the cluster N cell and ADC content.   The method used to correct the measured raw distribution for efficiency, acceptance and other detector effects, is based on unfolding with \u03c7 2 -minimization with regularization, similar to what is followed for charged particles measurement [1]. In this method all the detector effects are described by a response matrix, A. The matrix element A mt gives the conditional probability that an event with true multiplicity t is measured as an event with the multiplicity m (see Ref. [5] and references therein for detail). Figure 1(Left) shows the PMD detector response in terms of reconstructed photon multiplicity vs. true photon multiplicity within 2.3 < \u03b7 < 3.9 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV using 1.2 M events from the PHOJET event generator. The detector simulation is done using GEANT3 package in ALICE environment. This 2-dimensional distribution forms the response matrix to unfold the measured distribution in data. The unfolded spectrum is found by minimizing",

The data points at lower energies are obtained from Ref. [6]. In Ref. [6] the UA5 experiment presented the results for NSD events, therefore, the data points at 7 TeV, which are measured for INEL events, are scaled to the corresponding NSD using PYTHIA simulations. The solid line is the fit to the data points with a logarithmic function of the form p0 + p1 \u00d7 ln \u221a s. The   average number of photons within 2.3 < \u03b7 < 3.9 for NSD events increases with \u221a s, and the dependence is found to be logarithmic of the form as mentioned earlier.
