In five years of physics run the experiment collected 17.97 \u00d7 10 19 p.o.t. The detection of \u03c4 s produced in \u03bd\u03c4 CC interactions and of their decays is accomplished exploiting the high spatial resolution of nuclear emulsions. Furthermore OPERA has good capabilities in detecting electron neutrino interactions, setting limits on the \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bde oscillation channel. In this talk the status of the analysis will be presented together with updated results on both oscillation channels.",

It is installed in the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory and was exposed to an almost pure \u03bd \u00b5 beam (CNGS 2 ) produced by the CERN SPS, 730 km far away form the detector. The OPERA detector 3 is a hybrid apparatus, with nuclear emulsions complemented by electronic detectors. The core of the experiment is made of modular units called bricks. A brick is a \"sandwich\" of 56 1 mm thick lead plates, acting as target material, and 57 300 \u00b5m thick nuclear emulsion films, acting as high precision tracking devices. About 150000 bricks, for a total mass of about 1.25 kton, are arranged in vertical structures transverse to the beam direction called walls. Each wall is followed by two planes of plastic scintillator strips composing the Target * on behalf of the OPERA Collaboration Tracker (TT). At the downstream face of the brick, two additional emulsion films (Changeable Sheets, CS) can be removed without disassembling it and act as interface between the electronic detectors and the emulsions. The target section is followed by a muon spectrometer, composed of a dipole magnet instrumented with Drift Tubes and Resistive Plate Chambers. This structure is replicated in two subsequent Super-Modules.",

            "text": "Electronic detector data are processed in order to reconstruct events on-time with the CNGS beam and an algorithm classifies them as occurred inside (contained events) or outside (external events) the OPERA target. Only contained events are used for oscillation studies. Furthermore the identification of (at least) a three dimensional track as a muon, by evaluating the amount of traversed material, allows the separation of the sample into CC-like (also called 1\u00b5) and NC-like (0\u00b5) events. The muon charge and momentum are also measured, using the magnetic spectrometers. 4 For each event, the brick with the highest probability to contain the neutrino interaction is selected by a brick finding algorithm and the associated CS are analysed. If a signal compatible with TT data and with an upstream neutrino interaction is found, the corresponding brick is dismounted and the emulsion films are analysed, by means of fast automated optical microscope systems providing sub-micron spatial accuracy. Tracks found in CS are looked for in the most downstream film of the brick and then followed back from film to film, until they are not found in three consecutive films; this stopping point is considered as the signature either for a primary or a secondary vertex. A dedicated scanning of \u223c 2 cm 3 around the stopping point and a vertexing algorithm allow the vertex confirmation and provide the picture of the neutrino interaction. This picture is supplemented by a decay search procedure, aimed at the detection of decay topologies and/or secondary interactions, searching for large kink angle along tracks or for tracks with large impact parameter (IP) with respect to the primary vertex (since the IP for primary tracks usually does not exceed 10 \u00b5m). When a decay vertex is found, a full kinematical analysis is performed: the momentum of charged particles is estimated by measuring angular deviations due to the Multiple Coulomb Scattering in lead 5 , with a resolution of \u223c 22%; exploiting calorimetric techniques, made possible by the 10 X 0 thickness of the brick, the energy of electromagnetic showers coming from electrons or \u03b3-ray conversions can also be measured. Since charmed particles have lifetime and decay topologies similar to those of a \u03c4 lepton, \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions with the production of a charmed particle constitute the most relevant background for all \u03c4 decay channels, but also an important benchmark for the \u03c4 finding efficiency. In particular, observed charmed events in the 2008-2010 data (50 events) are in good agreement with Monte Carlo expectations (53 \u00b1 5 events).",

Track p 0 has been associated with a hadron, since it has a momentum of 0.90 +0.18 \u22120.13 GeV/c and it stops in the downstream brick; therefore the momentum-range correlation strongly disfavours the muon hypothesis. The other track is identified with the \u03c4 lepton decaying into a muon; indeed track d 1 , the decay daughter, has been matched with the muon track reconstructed by the electronic detectors, with a measured momentum of 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 GeV/c and a negative charge assessed with a 5.6 \u03c3 significance. The negative charge of the muon strongly suppresses the hypothesis of a charm event with an undetected primary muon.

Two different oscillation scenarios are considered. In the standard three-flavour mixing scheme, by introducing a cut at 20 GeV on the reconstructed energy to improve the signal-to-background ratio, 4.6 events are expected while 4 are observed, and an upper limit sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) < 0.44 is derived at the 90% Confidence Level (C.L.).
