For example, non-resonant D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) could appear in the D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mode. To understand the background from non-resonant D s decay, we look at M(D s ) distributions in the sideband region of the intermediate resonance (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , or K 0 S ) invariant mass. These studies show that the non-resonant modes produce negligible contributions to our signal modes.",

For Cabibbo-favored modes, we combine the two fit yields from the different \u03b7 decay modes according to the fit yield fractional error. The weighting factors for both D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 and D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7 \u2032 are 0.65 for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and 0.35 for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 .

The upper limit for the unobserved mode D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , normalized with respect to D + s \u2192 K + K 0 S , is also shown in Table II. We have considered several sources of systematic uncertainty. Finite MC statistics in determining reconstruction efficiencies introduces uncertainties at the level of less than 1%. The uncertainty associated with the efficiency for finding a track is 0.3%; an additional 0.6% systematic uncertainty for each kaon track is added. The relative systematic uncertainties for \u03c0 0 and K 0 S efficiencies are 4.2% and 1.8%, respectively. The systematic uncertainty for \u03b7 efficiencies cancels in all ratios. Uncertainties in the charged pion and kaon identification efficiencies are 0.3% per pion and 1.3% per kaon [5]. The systematic uncertainties from the K 0 S flight significance requirement and the low-momentum track veto are 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The signal shape parameters are taken from MC simulation, and have uncertainties related to possible flaws in simulation. We estimate this systematic uncertainty by allowing the signal shape parameters of the favored modes to float, and having the parameters of the suppressed modes track those of the favored modes. We find uncertainties of 0.2% to 2.9%, depending on mode. For the suppressed modes, the background quadratic term is also taken from MC simulation. We vary that term over a reasonable range, finding a systematic error of 2.4% to 10.6%, depending on mode.",
