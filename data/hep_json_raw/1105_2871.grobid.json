This agreement is evidence that the extrapolation of the higher energy K + measurements to an 8 GeV beam energy using Feynman scaling is valid. This measurement reduces the error on the K + production cross section from 40% to 14%.",

            "text": "Inclusive kaon production by low-energy protons (1 to 15 GeV) is of interest both theoretically and experimentally. In this low-energy region, kaon production is dominated by exclusive processes. For example, the lowest threshold K + production process is p + p \u2192 K + + \u039b + p, which for a fixed target setup has an incoming beam energy threshold of 2.52 GeV. Since exclusive channel threshold effects are important, theoretical models such as Feynman scaling [1] may be better in describing lowenergy production cross sections. Measurements of kaon production in this region are not extensive and do not cover wide kinematic regions. In addition, systematic data on the energy and target nuclei dependence is not available. Thus, new measurements of kaon production are needed in this region. Experimentally, kaon production is also relevant for neutrino experiments since important components of the incident neutrino flux come from kaon decays.",

The measurement of K + production in this energy region combined with K + production at higher energies is a good test of production models such as the Feynman-Scaling [6] and Modified Sanford-Wang [7] parameterization used to describe secondary meson production at low primary proton beam energy in the BNB. This work describes a measurement of K + production by measuring the rate of high-energy \u03bd \u00b5 events from kaon decay. The data sample used for the measurement comes from the interaction of \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 which undergo charged current (CC) neutrino interactions in the fiducial volume of the SciBooNE detector, generating high energy \u00b5 \u2212 and \u00b5 + (along with a host of other particles) that penetrate the entire SciBooNE detector, providing essentially a minimum muon momentum requirement of 1.0 GeV/c. The neutrinos from K + decay can be isolated using the angular distribution of the outgoing muons and the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the interaction. The number of K + decay neutrinos is then compared to prediction to make a determination of a normalization factor for production in the BNB and correspondingly a K + production cross section. The paucity of high-energy events in the SciBooNE experiment prevents a measurement of the kinematic distribution of K + production but does allow a normalization determination with improved uncertainty.",

Protons strike a 71.1 cm long beryllium target, producing a secondary beam of hadrons, mainly pions with a small fraction of kaons. A cylindrical horn electromagnet made of aluminum surrounds the beryllium target to sign-select and focus the secondary beam. For neutrino running mode, the horn polarity was set to focus particles with positive electric charge and for antineutrino running mode, the horn polarity was set to focus particles with negative electric charge. The neutrino beam is mostly produced in the 50 m long decay region. The analysis described in this paper will use data from both neutrino and antineutrino running modes.",

Fig. 3 shows the \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 flux in antineutrino mode from \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + , and K + decays, and their fractional uncertainties. The uncertainty in \u03c0 + (\u03c0 \u2212 ) production is determined from uncertainties associated with spline fits to the HARP \u03c0 + (\u03c0 \u2212 ) double differential cross section data [2] and differences between the SW and spline fit central values. The HARP data used were those from a thin (5% interaction length) beryllium target run [8]. While the HARP data provide a valuable constraint on the BNB flux prediction, additional uncertainties resulting from thick target effects (secondary re-scattering of protons and pions) are included through the BNB flux simulation. The resulting \u03c0 + production uncertainty is \u2248 5% at the peak of the flux distribution and increases significantly at high and low neutrino energies. The resulting \u03c0 \u2212 production uncertainty is \u2248 10% at the peak of the flux distribution and also increases at high and low neutrino energies.",

The nucleons are treated as quasifree particles with Fermi motion and Pauli blocking taken into account. The Fermi surface momentum (p F ) for carbon is set to 220 MeV/c and the nuclear potential (E B ) is set to 34 MeV/c, as extracted from electron scattering data [22] taking into account neutrino vs. electron scattering differences [23]. For the vector form factor, NUANCE uses the BBA-2003 form factor [24] with a dipole form for the axial form factor with an adjustable axial mass, M QE A for Carbon (M QE A -C) and for Hydrogen (M QE A -H). The M QE A -H is used only in the antineutrino mode running. In NUANCE, an empirical Pauli-blocking parameter, \u03ba is introduced [25] to better describe the MiniBooNE quasi-elastic data at low momentum transfer.

The selection cuts remove most of the cosmic background muons due to differences between cosmic background muons and muons created by neutrino beam interactions.

The number of SciBar reconstructed tracks for data and MC (along with its different contributions) can be seen in Fig. 5. The SciBar 1-Track sample contains mostly (78%) CCQE interactions, the SciBar 2-Track sample contains both CCQE(46%) and CC1\u03c0 (42%) and the SciBar 3-Track sample contains mostly CC1\u03c0(62%) events together with QE and DIS interactions. The reconstructed muon angle distributions for the SciBar 1, 2 and 3-Track samples are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows an excess in the MC events with respect to the data for low angle muon reconstructed tracks which is largely attributed to the difficulty in correctly modeling nuclear final state interactions. We believe that this MC/data discrepancy at low reconstructed muon angle is due to modeling of proton emission; the effect is covered by the uncertainty included for the modeling in Sec. V.",

The data collection   efficiency was also 95% in this case. The majority of events in antineutrino mode running are\u03bd \u00b5 from \u03c0 \u2212 decay, with a significant \u03bd \u00b5 contribution coming from the decay of positively charged \u03c0 + and K + . At higher energies (above 2 GeV), the positively charged \"wrong-sign\" particles, mainly \u03c0 + and K + , are strongly boosted in the forward direction, traveling downstream nearly parallel to the beam axis direction, such that they are not defocused by the magnetic horn. These particles create a 40% background of wrong sign neutrino interactions in the antineutrino mode run. In this analysis, we select a sample of high energy \u03bd \u00b5 coming from K + . The analysis strategy is very similar to what is described in Sec. III with the difference that the background composition in the selected sample is different. Background events result from high energy \u03bd \u00b5 from \u03c0 + produced in the initial p-Be interaction, and the decay of \u03c0 \u2212 (also produced in the initial p-Be interaction) that generate high energy\u03bd \u00b5 . Both the \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 result in high energy muons (with negative and positive charge respectively) that penetrate the SciBar, EC and MRD detectors. Positive and negative muons are indistinguishable in SciBooNE due to the lack of magnetic field in our detector system.",

V \u03bd stat (V\u03bd stat ) represents the statistical error in neutrino mode running (antineutrino mode running). An initial neutrino mode and antineutrino mode combined \u03c7 2 minimization is performed to determine the best cross-section normalization factors for both \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 as described in Appendix A. Pull terms on the crosssections normalization factors are added to keep the minimization physical. After the initial combined \u03c7 2 minimization, the cross-section weights are fixed in N pred i and M pred p at their minimized values and the pull terms are removed from the \u03c7 2 to evaluate the total (statisti-cal+systematical) uncertainty on the K + production or rate. These cross-section weights are initially minimized to allow for better agreement between data and MC in the plots and do not affect either K + production or rate weights because the large uncertainties on the neutrino cross-section values are already taken into account in the covariance matrix. The K + rate is measured by minimizing the same \u03c7 2 function as described in Eq. 4 but using Eq. A2 and Eq. A4 respectively for neutrino and antineutrino to predict the number of events. The covariance matrices used for the K + rate measurement does not include the cross section uncertainties for the \u03bd \u00b5 from K + in contrast to the matrices used for the flux measurement. A summary of the cross section normalizations is presented in Tab. VII. Many of these values are consistent with low energy precision cross-section measurements from the MiniBooNE experiment [2,[39][40][41] though the two sets of cross-section values are measured at different energies. The MiniBooNE collaboration measures cross-sections at neutrino energies less than 2 GeV while the cross-section values listed in Tab. VII are at neutrino energies greater than 3 GeV (as could be seen from Tab. IV and Tab. VI).",

The Fermi surface momentum (p F ) for carbon is set to 217(220) MeV/c and the nuclear potential (E B ) is set to 25(34) MeV/c for NEUT(NUANCE), as extracted from electron scattering data [22]. The default binding energy in NUANCE is somewhat higher than in NEUT because it additionally accounts for neutrino vs. electron scattering differences [23]. With regards to the vector form factor, NEUT uses a dipole form with a vector mass of 0.84 GeV/c 2 , while NUANCE uses the BBA-2003 form factor [24]. A dipole form is used for the axial form factor with an  The resonant production of single pion, kaon, and eta mesons, as described by the model of Rein and Sehgal (RS) [26], is implemented with axial-vector form factors formalized to be dipole with M 1\u03c0 A = 1.21 GeV/c 2 for NEUT and M 1\u03c0 A = 1.10 GeV/c 2 for NUANCE. Resonance decays leading to multi-pion final states are also included in the NUANCE model as described in Sec. II D. In NEUT, multi-pion production is simulated as deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and the RS model is not used. Multi-hadron final states are simulated by two models: a custom-made program [42] for events with W between 1.3 and 2.0 GeV/c 2 and PYTHIA/JETSET [43] for events with W larger than 2 GeV/c 2 . The pion multiplicity is additionally restricted to be greater than one for 1.3 < W < 2 GeV/c 2 to avoid double-counting sources of single pion production.
