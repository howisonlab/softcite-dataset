            "text": "Absolute luminosity measurements at a particle collider are mandatory to determine absolute crosssections for reaction processes. Specifically, the number of interactions, N , measured in an experiment depends on the value of cross-section \u03c3 and of the luminosity L, with N = \u03c3L. The uncertainty in the measurement of a given cross-section depends critically on, and is in some cases dominated by, the precision with which the luminosity is known. The LHC experiments calibrate the scale of the luminosity with van der Meer (vdM) scans [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. This technique, which involves scanning the beams across each other and monitoring the interaction rate, has been used by all of the four large LHC experiments. The method is intended to measure the overlap integral O I of the colliding proton beams with proton densities \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 2",

The vdM scan method relies on the assumption that the bunch proton densities are factorizable in the scanning plane of the detector, i.e. that \u03c1 i (x, y) = \u03c1 i (x)\u03c1 i (y). In general, this assumption does not hold and introduces one of the leading systematic uncertainties for luminosity calibration measurements [4,5,7,8,9]. The LHCb collaboration exploits the combination of beam-gas and beam-beam vertex distributions to reconstruct the individual proton bunch densities [6,10]. Another approach exploits the simultaneous evolution of the luminosity and of the position, size, shape and orientation of the luminous region [5,8,9] during beam-beam scans. In addition, a dedicated tailoring of the proton bunches in the injection chain was developed to minimize non-Gaussian contributions to the transverse beam profiles [11].",

            "text": "We discussed a method to reconstruct two-dimensional proton-bunch densities using vertex distributions recorded in LHC beam-beam scans. The x-y correlations in the beam shapes are studied and an alternative luminosity calibration technique is introduced. As shown in Section 2, correlations in x-y can lead to significant biases on the luminometer visible cross section estimate. The beam imaging method presented in this paper allows to directly measure the underlying x-y correlations, and thereby determine the two-dimensional beam-overlap integral. The method is directly applicable for transverse beam shapes that can be analytically convolved with vertex position resolution models. For arbitrary beam shapes, where numerical convolution methods have to be utilized, limitations due to computational performance arise. In Section 3, we propose a fit model for two-dimensional vertex distributions in the transverse plane of a detector accumulated during beam imaging scans, where one beam is kept fixed and the other one is moved in x and y. We evaluate the method on a sample of simulated beam imaging scans with double-Gaussian beam shapes. After applying a dedicated correction based on a neural network regression technique the beam overlap integral is reconstructed to good precision over a large range of parameters describing non-factorization. Deployed under experimental conditions, the impact on the method introduced by effects such as beam-orbit drift, spatial vertex reconstruction resolution, and beam-beam effects have to be investigated. Alternatively, the beam imaging method can be combined with the standard vdM scan method to account for non-factorization effects, where excellent performance is shown.",
