The LHC provides a unique opportunity to explore the TeV scale where these phenomena may become apparent, and can be searched for using the precision tracking and high energy resolution calorimetry of the ATLAS detector. This poster presents the search for high mass resonances in the dilepton channel, and was conducted with an integrated luminosity of 1.08/1.21 fb \u22121 in the dielectron/dimuon channel respectively, at a centre of mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV.",

            "text": "There are many possible extensions to the Standard Model (SM) predicted at the TeV energy scale which may be visible at the LHC. Many of these extensions predict extra U(1) symmetry with an associated spin-1 particle [1]  [2]. In its simplest form this U(1) symmetry can be arbitrarily added to the existing SM gauge group, resulting in SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) from the SM, and additionally U(1) \u2032 for the Sequential Standard Model Z \u2032 SSM . More rigorously motivated models proceed via the decomposition of Grand Unified Theories such as E 6 \u2192 SO(10)\u00d7U(1) \u03c8 \u2192 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1) \u03c7 \u00d7 U(1) \u03c8 leading to Z \u2032 (\u03b8) = Z \u2032 \u03c7 cos\u03b8 + Z \u2032 \u03c8 sin\u03b8, where the mixing angle \u03b8 determines the coupling to fermions and results in various possible models with specific Z \u2032 states. Other extensions of the SM seek to answer questions such as the hierarchy problem where the relative weakness of gravity compared to the other forces of nature can be explained with the use of warped extra dimensions in theories such as the Randall-Sundrum model [3]. A feature of this theory would be a massive spin-2 particle called the graviton (G * ) which should be observable at the LHC and have a mass/width that depends on the curvature of the warped dimension, k, and the reduced Planck scale, M Pl , leading to another parameter of interest, the coupling k/M Pl . Both of the new particles mentioned would appear as resa e-mail: daniel.hayden@cern.ch onances in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum measured by the ATLAS detector [4], and these results comprise a search using the detector in this endeavor.",
