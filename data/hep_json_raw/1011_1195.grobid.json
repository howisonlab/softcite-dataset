The signal D momentum (p sig ) and energy (E sig ) can then be reconstructed. The signal and non-signal D candidates must have opposite sign; the signal e \u00b1 and the non-signal D daughters must respect charge correlation assuming Cabibbo-favored decays. We require E evt miss > 50 MeV and a total vetoed-shower energy under 300 MeV. \u2206E for both D candidates and E evt miss \u2212 c|p evt miss | must be consistent with zero within mode-dependent limits of about 100 MeV. To improve resolution in \u2206E sig , we take E \u03bd = c|p evt miss |. By making the further, very good, assumption that the |p evt miss | resolution dominates the \u2206E sig resolution, we can also improve M BC . We rescale p evt miss by a correction \u03b6 that would result in \u2206E sig = 0: p \u03bd = \u03b6p evt miss with \u03b6 = 1 + \u2206E sig /(c|p evt miss |). Signal mode yields are determined from fits to the resulting M BC distributions. To increase signal sensitivity in our yield fit, we classify a high-quality (HQ) sample with the following properties: no unused showers, all \u03b3\u03b3 candidates with \u22125 < \u03c7 M (Y ) < 3, Y \u2208 (\u03b7, \u03c0 0 ), and a non-signal D satisfying the tagged analysis \u2206E and M BC criteria. Reconstruction efficiencies, not including submode branching fractions, range from 2-5% overall, and 1-3% for the HQ subsample.

The generic DD sample is equivalent to 34 times the data statistics. Figure 1 shows the U distributions for the tagged analysis.

Our reconstruction efficiencies, including subsidiary branching fractions, are (3.26 \u00b1 0.04)% and (0.86 \u00b1 0.02)%, respectively, for these modes. We expect a total background for the combined \u03b7 \u2032 decay modes of 0.043 \u00b1 0.026 events. Our background estimate is based on studies of the DD MC sample, of the generic non-DD sample, and of higher statistics MC samples of background channels likely to fake the signal.

Using a toy simulation that folds Poisson statistics with statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find the probability for this background to fluctuate into 5 events to be 9.7 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , a 5.6 standard deviation (s.d.) significance.

We employ a binned likelihood fit that incorporates the Barlow-Beeston methodology [16] to accommodate finite MC statistics. Simultaneous fitting accommodates crossfeed among all modes. The signal and DD simulations are corrected based on independent data and MC comparisons for the aspects most critical to the technique: the hadronic D decay model, hadronic showering in the electromagnetic calorimeter, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 reconstruction efficiencies, K 0 L energy depositions, and FSR. To probe the hadronic decay model, we used the GR reconstruction method with the charged and neutral D hadronic tags D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , respectively, in place of our semileptonic signal modes. We classified 108 separate decay topologies for the generically-reconstructed D opposite the tag. The observed rates were unfolded and efficiency-corrected, resulting in a decay model that, when combined with semileptonic measurements, accounts for 97.2% \u00b1 2.0% of all D decays. To minimize systematic effects in this procedure, the rates were normalized to the unfolded D \u2212 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 andD 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 to obtain branching fraction ratios. These were then rescaled to world averages [10] for these two modes. As part of this process, we also adjusted daughter spectra in the MC to reflect our data. The efficiency-corrected \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e and partial \u03b7e + \u03bd e yields float in the fit, as does the DD background normalization for each separate submode. Figure 2 shows excellent agreement between data and fit projections. The fit likelihood is normalized so that it would correspond to a standard \u03c7 2 in the large statistics limit [17]. We find \u22122 ln L = 529.7 for 608 \u2212 10 degrees of freedom, providing further evidence of a well-behaved fit. Fixing the \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e yield at zero increases the \u22122 ln L by +33.6, corresponding to a statistical significance for the observed \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e yield of 5.8 standard deviations.",

Because the background normalizations float and the background distributions are quite flat, systematic effects must change the M BC shape to affect the signal yields significantly. We have used a toy MC simulation to estimate the degradation of the significance from additive systematic effects. The toy MC model takes the data yields in the M BC region dominated by signal, integrated over all submodes but subdivided based on the high-quality tagging. The statistical model includes the independent Poisson fluctuations of the two subsamples, and the background normalization uncertainty that is correlated between the two subsamples. This toy model, which neglects some information used in the true fit, yields a statistical significance of 5.73 standard deviations, very close to our observed significance. The additive systematics are dominated by modeling of the K 0 L energy deposition, of fake charged tracks and of the momentum spectra of the hadronic decays. When we incorporate the additive systematic uncertainties in the toy MC model, taking into account the correlations between the two subsamples, we find a reduction in the significance that is less than 0.05 standard deviations. The \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e M BC distributions for the three most influential modes are shown for both the HQ and non-HQ samples in Fig. 3. The data and fit are in excellent agreement across all these subsamples. We also examine the signal side \u2206E, the electron momentum spectrum, the missing momentum spectrum and the distribution of cos \u03b8 W e for both D + \u2192 \u03b7e + \u03bd e (Fig. 4) and D + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e (Fig. 5). The angle \u03b8 W e is the opening angle between the electron and the virtual W in the W boson's rest frame, and should be distributed as sin 2 \u03b8 W e for pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar semileptonic decays such as these. The MC fit components are scaled according to the nominal fit results. The \u2206E range extends outside of the limits imposed for the fit, and none of these distributions are used in the fit. In both the higher statistics D + \u2192 \u03b7e + \u03bd e and in the D + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e mode the scaled fit components and data agree very well, but would not without the signal components. The figures also show excellent agreement between data and the scaled fit components for the inclusive \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 momentum spectra from the D reconstructed against the semileptonic candidate.

In forming the covariance matrix for the form factor fits for \u03b7e + \u03bd e (see below), the uncertainties for a given systematic effect are treated either as fully correlated or anticorrelated. Treating the uncertainties from each effect as a column vector T i , the covariance matrix V syst is then Table IV summarizes all branching fraction and 90% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit results. The GR branching fractions B GR were obtained from the measured branching ratios R GR = B(D + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 e + \u03bd e )/B(D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) using B(D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) = (9.14 \u00b1 0.20)% [9]. The branching fractions measured using the different \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 decay modes are consistent in both techniques.",
