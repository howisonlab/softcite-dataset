The expected SM branching fractions for these decays are B(B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + ) \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 ) \u223c 6.8 \u00d7 10 \u22129 [2], in which the largest contribution comes from radiative corrections and \u03c9-\u03c6 mixing. In some New Physics (NP) scenarios such as models with a Z \u2032 boson [3,4] or the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) [5], the branching fractions could be enhanced up to the 10 \u22127 level.

The event shape in the CM frame is spherical for BB events and jet-like for continuum events. This difference is exploited by the event-shape variable, which is a Fisher discriminant formed out of 16 modified Super Fox-Wolfram moments [12,13] calculated in the CM frame. The angle of the B flight direction (\u03b8 * B ) with respect to the beam axis provides additional discrimination since it is distributed as (1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 * B ) for B decays but flat for continuum. The distance in the z direction (\u2206z) between the signal B vertex [14] and that of the other B is used in the continuum suppression if |\u2206z| is less than 2.0 mm. For B events, the average value of |\u2206z| is approximately 0.2 mm, whereas continuum events tend to have a common vertex that is measured with a resolution of about 1.0 mm. In addition, the helicity angle (\u03b8 H ) discriminates between the signal and continuum events, where \u03b8 H is the angle between the final state K + direction and the B meson direction in the \u03c6 rest frame. We first calculate the individual probability density function (PDF) for the Fisher discriminant, cos\u03b8 * B , \u2206z and cos\u03b8 H , and then obtain their product,",

The effect of the small correlation between M bc and \u2206E has been checked with a fully simulated sample and is found to be negligible. We use the decays B + \u2192 \u03c6K + andB 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 0 as control samples to correct for differences between data and MC simulations for the fitted means and widths of M bc and \u2206E. The PDF for \u2206E is a sum of two Gaussians for B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + with a common mean, two widths and fraction fixed to the values obtained from a fit to B + \u2192 \u03c6K + data, and a Crystal Ball function [17] with the mean and width fixed to the values derived fromB 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 0 data for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 . The PDF for M bc is a Gaussian function with mean and width fixed to the values obtained from the respective control samples for both modes. To obtain the two-dimensional PDF for the continuum background, we multiply the PDF of M bc , for which we use an ARGUS [18] function, with the PDF of \u2206E, which is modeled using a first-order Chebyshev polynomial for B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 . Both the ARGUS shape parameter and the \u2206E slope are allowed to float. The PDF of the b \u2192 c background is modeled with two-dimensional histograms (2D HistoPDF) with each fixed yield derived from MC simulations. The b \u2192 u, d, s transition backgrounds are modeled with two-dimensional histograms with fixed yields derived from MC simulations except for B + \u2192 \u03c6K + . The PDF for B + \u2192 \u03c6K + is a double Gaussian function for \u2206E and a Gaussian for M bc , in which the mean, widths, fraction and yield are fixed to the values derived from a fit to B + \u2192 \u03c6K + data using the particle indentification requirement R K,\u03c0 > 0.6 for kaon candidates. Possible backgrounds to \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays are predominantly from B \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 with f 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 , a 0 (980) \u2192 K + K \u2212 or a nonresonant contribution. The two-dimensional fit to M bc and \u2206E alone cannot distinguish the signal from other B \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 events. We model B \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0, B \u2192 a 0 (980)\u03c0 and nonresonant B \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 with uniform phase space distributions; these backgrounds are treated as additional components in the fits. To evaluate their contributions, we examine events in the \u03c6 mass sidebands, M K + K \u2212 < 1.0 GeV/c 2 and 1.039 GeV/c 2 < M K + K \u2212 < 1.1 GeV/c 2 . We apply the same two-dimensional fit to the sideband events assuming that signal-like events are dominated by each of the above three background sources. The possible contribution to the signal is then included as a background PDF corresponding to a signal PDF with fixed mean, width(s) and fraction from each component. As we cannot distinguish these three components, we take the nonresonant mode that gives the largest signal yield as the central value. This background contribution is found to be 4.7 +1.4 \u22121.3 events for B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + and 1.6 +1.0 \u22120.9 events for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 , derived from the data sideband. The expected yields, 4.7 events for B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + and 1.6 events for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 , are fixed. We summarize the PDF shape and expected yields (fit outputs) for various components in Table I. Figure 2 shows the \u2206E and M bc projections of the fit for the selected B candidates. There are a total of 373 B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + and 272 B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 candidates in the data sample. We determine the signal yields to be N s (B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + ) = 4.5 +5.1 \u22124.3 and N s (B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 ) = \u22122.2 +2.1 \u22121.2 , where the quoted error is statistical only. We observe no significant signal for B + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + or B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 decays. The branching fraction B is calculated from the observed yield as",
