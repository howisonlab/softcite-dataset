            "text": "The cross-section for the production of a single top quark in association with a W boson in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV is measured. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS detector in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Events containing two leptons and one central b-jet are selected. The W t signal is separated from the backgrounds using boosted decision trees, each of which combines a number of discriminating variables into one classifier. Production of W t events is observed with a significance of 7.7\u03c3. The cross-section is extracted in a profile likelihood fit to the classifier output distributions. The W t cross-section, inclusive of decay modes, is measured to be 23.0\u00b11.3(stat.) +3.2   \u22123.5 (syst.)\u00b11.1(lumi.) pb. The measured cross-section is used to extract a value for the CKM matrix element |V tb | of 1.01 \u00b1 0.10 and a lower limit of 0.80 at the 95% confidence level. The cross-section for the production of a top quark and a W boson is also measured in a fiducial acceptance requiring two leptons with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, one jet with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and E miss T > 20 GeV, including both W t and top-quark pair events as signal. The measured value of the fiducial cross-section is 0.85 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) +0.06   \u22120.07 (syst.)\u00b10.03(lumi.) pb.",

            "text": "The production of a single top quark at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) proceeds via the weak interaction in the Standard Model (SM). The three main modes of single topquark production are: t-channel, the exchange of a W boson between a light quark and a heavy quark; s-channel, via a virtual W boson; and W t, the production of a top quark in association with a W boson. Single top-quark production depends on the top-quark coupling to the W boson, which is parameterised by the form factor f LV and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb [1][2][3]. The cross-section for each of the three production modes is proportional to the square of |f LV V tb | [4,5]. Physics beyond the SM can contribute to the single top-quark final state and modify the production crosssections [6,7] as well as the kinematic distributions, for example through a resonance that decays to W t [8,9]. The production of single top quarks has been observed at the Tevatron protonantiproton collider in the t-channel [10,11] and s-channel [12][13][14], as well as their combination [15][16][17]. The W t process has a small expected cross-section at the Tevatron and was not observed. The t-channel mode has been observed by both the ATLAS [18,19] and CMS [20,21] collaborations at the LHC. The s-channel mode has not yet been measured at the LHC because of its small production cross-section [22]. Evidence for W t production was reported by ATLAS [23] and CMS [24] in proton-proton (pp) collisions at 7 TeV. The observation of W t production in pp collisions at 8 TeV has been reported by CMS [25].",

The measurement is carried out in the dilepton final state shown in figure 1 where each W boson decays to an electron or a muon and a neutrino (e\u03bd or \u00b5\u03bd). This analysis requires two opposite-sign high-transverse-momentum (p T ) leptons (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5), missing transverse momentum (E miss T ), and one high-p T central jet, which is required to contain a b-hadron (b-jet). The main background to this signature is from tt production, with smaller backgrounds coming from dibosons (W W , W Z, ZZ), Z+jets, and events where one or both leptons are misidentified (fake-lepton events) or non-prompt. Control regions enriched in tt and other background events are also defined. Events in the ttenriched regions fulfil the same lepton and missing transverse momentum requirements, and have exactly two jets, with one or both of the jets required to be identified as a b-jet. Events in the other background-enriched regions have one or two jets which are required to not be identified as b-jets. The backgrounds are estimated with simulation, except the non-prompt or fake-lepton background, which is estimated from data. Boosted decision trees (BDT) are used to optimise the discrimination between signal and background [33]. The cross-section is extracted using a profile likelihood fit of the BDT response. The background normalisation and the systematic uncertainties are constrained by simultaneously analysing phase-space regions with substantial W t signal contributions and regions where the W t contributions are negligible. The ratio of the measured cross-section to the theoretical prediction (which assumes V tb = 1) is used to extract a value of |f LV V tb |.",

This background contribution includes the t-channel and s-channel single topquark production modes. The normalisation and shape of the non-prompt or fake-lepton background is determined directly from data, using the matrix method [70]. In addition to events from the signal data sample (labelled as \"tight\" events), a second (\"loose\") set enriched with fake leptons is defined by removing the lepton isolation requirement. Given the probabilities for real and fake leptons that already passed the loose selection to also pass the tight selection, the number of tight events with a fake lepton is determined from a linear system of equations. Generated events are passed through a simulation [71] of the ATLAS detector based on Geant4 [72] and reconstructed using the same procedure as for collision data. The alternative tt samples used to evaluate theory modelling uncertainties are instead processed with the ATLFAST-II [71] simulation, which employs a parameterisation of the response of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and Geant4 for the other detector components. The simulations also include the effect of multiple pp collisions per bunch crossing (pileup).",

The largest number of expected signal events is in the 1-jet region with one b-tagged jet, while events in the two-jet regions with one or two b-tags are dominated by tt. These three regions are included in the cross-section fit. Two additional regions are used to validate the modelling of the other backgrounds but are not included in the fit. One-jet and two-jet events that have zero b-tagged jets compose the 0-tag control regions, which are enhanced JHEP01(2016)064 in the other backgrounds. Observed yields and kinematic distributions in the 0-tag control regions are studied while choosing the selection cuts; the three regions included in the cross-section fit are not part of this optimisation procedure. The predicted event yields for signal and backgrounds, and their uncertainties, are summarised in table 2. Uncertainties from different sources are added in quadrature, not taking into account possible correlations. Many of the sources of systematic uncertainty are common to the W t signal and tt background processes, and correlated between regions (see section 6). The numbers of events observed in data and the total predicted yields are compatible within the uncertainties. The W t signal comprises 21% of the total expected event yield in the 1-jet 1-tag region. The main background originates from the production of top-quark pair events, which accounts for almost 80% of the total event yield in the 1-jet 1-tag region. For the other regions included in the fit, the expected fraction of signal events is smaller, 9% in the 2-jet 1-tag region and 3% in the 2-jet 2-tag region, which is the most enriched in tt. The other backgrounds are small in the 1-jet 1-tag and 2-jet regions where they account for 2% of the total event yield.

The BDTs are trained separately in three regions, 1-jet 1-tag, 2-jet 1-tag and 2-jet 2tag, using simulated W t events as signal and simulated tt events as background. Three   equal-size W t samples are combined to reduce sensitivity to the modelling uncertainties and to maximise the number of events available for training: the Powheg-Box+Pythia sample with the DR scheme, the Powheg-Box+Pythia sample with the DS scheme, and the Powheg-Box+Herwig sample with the DR scheme. The AdaBoost boosting algorithm is used [74]. This algorithm increases the event weight for mis-classified events for consecutive trees in the training. The final BDT is then the weighted average over all trees. The list of variables entering the BDT algorithm is chosen based on the power to discriminate the W t signal from the tt background and is derived from a large set of kinematic variables that show good agreement between data and MC simulation. The number of input variables is a compromise between the achievable discrimination power and possible overtraining. As a result of this optimisation procedure, 13, 16, and 16 variables are selected for the 1-jet 1-tag, 2-jet 1-tag, and 2-jet 2-tag regions, respectively. The BDT input variables used in the three regions are explained below and are listed in table 3 together with their importance ranking. The objects (denoted o 1 , . . . , o n ) used to define these kinematic variables are the leading-and second-leading lepton ( 1 and 2 ) and jet (j 1 and j 2 ) as well as E miss T .

The most important variable is p sys T ( 1 , 2 , E miss T , j 1 ), which is sensitive to the unidentified b-quark in tt events. This variable peaks at lower values for W t and has a longer tail for tt. The second most important variable is the separation of the leading lepton and the jet, in \u03c6-\u03b7 space. These two objects originate from the same top quark in W t events, leading to a sharper peak than in tt events. Figure 6 shows the most important discriminating variables in the 2-jet regions. Here, the p sys T distribution also peaks at lower values for W t than for tt, but the distribution is also broader for W t, resulting in a long tail. The invariant mass variables are important for 2-jet events, where half of the possible lepton-jet pairings correspond to the objects from the decay of one of the top quarks in tt events leading to a peak at lower invariant mass. For W t, only one quarter of the possible pairings of jets and leptons correspond to the objects from the top-quark decay.",

The ratio of the measured cross-section to the theoretical prediction is equal to |f LV V tb | 2 , where the form factor f LV could be modified by new physics or radiative corrections through anomalous coupling contributions, for example those in refs. [3,91,92]. The W t production and top-quark decays through |V ts | and |V td | are assumed to be small. A lower limit on |V tb | is obtained for f LV = 1 as in the SM, without assuming CKM unitarity [5,93]. An additional systematic uncertainty due to a variation of the top-quark mass by 1 GeV is included in the V tb extraction. The uncertainties on the theoretical cross-section due to the variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scale (0.6 pb), the PDF uncertainty (1.4 pb), and the beam-energy uncertainty [94] (0.38 pb) are also accounted for.",

The p T of each of the leptons is corrected by adding the energy and momentum of photons inside a cone of size \u2206R = 0.1 around the lepton direction. Electrons and muons are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jets are clustered from particles using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4. Neutrinos, electrons and muons from W -boson decays as well as particles resulting from pileup are excluded from jet clustering. Particles from the underlying event are included. The particle-level jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 and are matched with nearby b-hadrons with a p T of at least 5 GeV using the ghost tagging method [96]. Jets within \u2206R = 0.2 of the nearest electron are removed from the list. Following that, electrons and muons within \u2206R = 0.4 of the nearest jet are removed. Missing transverse momentum is calculated using neutrinos from W -boson decays. The W t and tt events pass the fiducial selection if they have exactly two leptons, exactly one b-jet and E miss T > 20 GeV. The numbers of simulated W t and tt events passing this fiducial selection are shown in table 5",
