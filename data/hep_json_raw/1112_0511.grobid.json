COMPASS is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS and features a two-stage spectrometer with high momentum resolution, large acceptance, particle identification and calorimetry. A short pilot run in 2004 resulted in the observation of a spin-exotic state with J P C = 1 \u2212+ consistent with the debated \u03c01(1600). In addition, Coulomb production at low momentum transfer data provide a test of Chiral Perturbation Theory. During 2008 and 2009, a world leading data set was collected with hadron beam which is currently being analysed. The large statistics allows for a thorough decomposition of the data into partial waves. The COMPASS hadron data span over a broad range of channels and shed light on several different aspects of QCD.",

            "text": "The aim of hadron physics is a fundamental understanding of all bound and resonant systems which interact via the strong force. At short distances, perturbation theory can be applied and its predictions have been rigorously and successfully tested. At longer distances, the self-coupling of the gluons makes perturbation theory inapplicable and effective field theories such as Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT), or advanced computational tools like Lattice QCD, have to be used instead. It is generally believed that the key to understand QCD at low and intermediate momentum transfers lies in the hadron spectrum. Apart from the conventional quark-antiquark (qq) and quark triplet (qqq) states within the simple contituent quark model, QCD also allows for hadronic matter with excited gluonic degrees of freedom, provided they are colour neutral. A glueball is a state described entirely in terms of gluonic fields with no constituent quarks, whereas a hybrid is a meson with a constituent gluonic excitation. The excited glue in a hybrid contributes to its quantum numbers, which enables states with quantum numbers J P C which are forbidden for simple qq pairs to be formed. Such states are called spin-exotics. Lattice calculations predict a spin-exotic hybrid with mass within 1-2 GeV/c 2 [1]. Some promising candidates have been found in experiments: the \u03c0 1 (1400) seen by BNL, VES and Chrystal Barrel [2], the \u03c0 1 (1600) reported by BNL and VES [3] and the \u03c0 1 (2000) observed by BNL [4], but the resonance character of these states is disputed to this day. One goal of the COMPASS hadron programme is to bring clarity into this issue.",

The negative hadron beam consisted of 96.8% \u03c0 \u2212 and 2.4% K \u2212 , whereas the positive consisted of 74.6% p, 24.0% \u03c0 + and 1.4% K + , all with momentum 190 GeV/c. The beam particles were identified by differential Cerenkov detectors (CEDARs) located upstream of the target. The major part of the hadron data were collected using a 40 cm long liquid hydrogen target, but there were also runs with various thin nuclear target discs such as lead, nickel and tungsten. The target was surrounded by a Recoil Proton Detector (RPD) where the recoil target proton was detected. The forward going particles were detected in the two-stage magnetic spectrometer providing precise tracking, RICH particle identification and calorimetry. The layout of the COMPASS spectrometer is shown in Fig. 1. At the COMPASS beam energy, 190 GeV/c, three production mechanisms are accessible. In diffractive dissociation, reggeon exchange between the target and the beam hadron excites the beam to an intermediate state X, which then decays. This is a likely production mechanism for spin exotic hybrids, provided they exist. In central production, double reggeon exchange form a state X. Double Pomeron exchange is a special case of this process and provides a glue-rich environment which should be suitable for glueball production. In Coulomb production, the target radiates a photon which excites the beam hadron. This process is important at low momentum transfer and is a testing ground for \u03c7PT.",

In the analysis, presented in Ref. [8], diffractive dissociation of the beam pion into an intermediate state X \u2212 was considered, where X \u2212 decays subsequently into a \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state. The selected momentum transfer range was 0.1 < t \u2032 < 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 , where t \u2032 = t\u2212t min and t = (p beam \u2212p X ) 2 . In this region, the nucleons in the lead nucleus act as quasi-free particles. The data sample comprised 420 000 events. The quantum numbers of X \u2212 , i.e. the spin J, parity P , C-parity C, spin projection M and reflectivity \u01eb, were disentangled by Partial-Wave Analysis (PWA). COMPASS uses two independent programs for this task, one developed at Illinois, JINR Dubna and IHEP Protvino [9], and one at Brookhaven [10]. They have been adapted for COMPASS [11]. The analysis was performed in two steps: fit in bins of the three-pion invariant mass m X , followed by a mass-dependent fit (for details, see [8]). A spin exotic J P C = 1 \u2212+ wave was observed, consistent with the disputed \u03c0 1 (1600) [3]. A preliminary mass-independent PWA of \u224825% of the available the 2008/09 data set, collected using a hydrogen target and comprising 23 million \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events, confirms the enhancement in the intensity around M X = 1.7 GeV/c 2 and the phase motion with respect to the 1 ++ resonance [12]. Mass-dependent fitting, background studies of e.g. the Deck effect [13] and leakage studies are ongoing for more definite conclusions.",

Right: The \u03b3\u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section [18]. The points are COMPASS 2004 data, the red curve \u03c7PT predictions [23], the blue the full systematic uncertainty and the back curve the uncertainty from luminosity.",
