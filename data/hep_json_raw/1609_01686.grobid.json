The data collected until 2012 at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and integrated luminosities of 5 fb \u22121 and 20 fb \u22121 , respectively, agree with the expectation from standard model processes. Constraints on supersymmetry have been calculated and interpreted in different models. Limits on supersymmetry particle masses at the TeV scale have been derived and interpreted generally in the context of simplified model spectra. The constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model is disfavored by the experimental results. Natural supersymmetry scenarios with low supersymmetry particle masses remain possible in multiple regions, for example in those with compressed spectra, that are difficult to access experimentally. The upgraded LHC operating at \u221a s = 13 TeV is gaining sensitivity to the remaining unexplored SUSY parameter space.",

In particular after the standard model (SM) Higgs boson has been discovered [1,2], the experiments focus on searches for new physics which is expected to explain some of the open questions of the standard model, like the so-called gauge hierarchy problem or the nature of the dark matter in the universe. While the standard model is a remarkably successful theory, it has multiple free parameters with values constrained only by experimental observations. A grand unified theory (GUT) could reduce the number of free parameters by virtue of a larger symmetry.",

The masses of the superpartners differ, because SUSY is a broken symmetry. The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [13,14] contains chiral supermultiplets, e.g. a spin-1/2 fermion and two scalar bosons. The fermion has two spin helicity states, therefore two real scalar bosons have the same number of degrees of freedom. Other vector supermultiplets contain spin-1 vector bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, both having two helicity states. In extended supersymmetry N > 1 models the supermultiplets are enlarged.

Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking [29,30] is another breaking scenario, which will not be considered in the following. The mass scale of the SUSY particles is generally undetermined by the theory, but can be constrained by the following considerations. The higher-order corrections \u223c \u03bbm 2 ln(\u039b UV /m) to the Higgs mass m 2 H depend on the particle masses but only logarithmically on the cutoff scale and thus matter only if the differences in mass of the members of a supermultiplet become too large. This is in particular relevant for the third quark generation supermultiplet of the top with the large top-quark Yukawa couplings at first-loop order, and for gluinos at second-loop order. Heavy third generation squarks and gluinos have large contributions to \u2206m 2 H . The non-observation of the Higgs boson near the electroweak scale at LEP was referred to as little hierarchy problem [31], as a large Higgs mass requires large radiative corrections and thus large stop masses between 300 GeV and 1 TeV [32] in the MSSM. The supersymmetry naturalness requirement is illustrated [32] by the tree-level relation in the MSSM",

The coupling strengths are given by the Yukawa constants \u03bb, \u03bb , and \u03bb . The bilinear term allows the mixing of the lepton and Higgs superfields. RPV implies lepton-or baryon number violation and sufficiently large couplings allow the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle, the LSP. If R-parity is conserved because all RPV couplings vanish or at least are sufficiently small, then supersymmetric particles are only produced in pairs, and the LSP is stable. If the RPV-couplings are so small or zero, that the LSP-lifetime is large compared to the age of the universe, then the LSP is a particle candidate for dark matter. The dark matter candidate has to be a massive, only weakly interacting particle, like the lightest neutralino\u03c7 0 1 . In the following, RPV couplings are assumed to be zero. The minimal supergravity model or the cMSSM is a MSSM scenario with gravity-mediated SUSY breaking determined by five parameters m 0 , m 1/2 , A 0 , tan \u03b2, and the sign of \u00b5. The universal scalar mass m 0 determines the mass of the scalar sparticles, i.e. the squarks and the sleptons masses at the GUT scale M GUT \u2248 10 16 GeV. The common mass of the gauginos and higgsinos at M GUT is m 1/2 . A 0 is the universal trilinear coupling defined at M GUT and tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. The absolute value of the higgsino mass parameter |\u00b5| is determined by the electroweak symmetry breaking, leaving only the sign of \u00b5 as discrete free cMSSM parameter. A 0 , tan \u03b2, and the sign of \u00b5 have generally only a small influence on the experimentally observables and are choosen such, that the predicted Higgs mass is consistent with the measurement of approximately m H = 125 GeV. The m 0 and m 1/2 parameters determine the masses and branching ratios of the supersymmetric particles. The relation of the supersymmetric particles masses are therefore constrained by effectively only two degrees of freedom. On one hand this allows for concise comparisons of experimental results in the m 0 and m 1/2 parameter plane, on the other hand many different mass spectra and branching ratios viable in other SUSY models are not examined. Past \u221a s = 7 TeV searches for supersymmetry often used the cMSSM for interpretation of the experimental results. Recently, less constrained models like the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) [35][36][37] gained attention. The pMSSM is more difficult to scrutinize and the results are harder to display, because of the much larger number of 19 free parameters. The theoretical viable phase space of the cMSSM is challenged [38,39] by recent experimental results discussed in the following.",

The current experimental results at \u221a s = 8 TeV are commonly interpreted using these simplified scenarios [51,52]. The SMS are effective-Lagrangian descriptions of single processes involving just a small number of new particles, to which the analyses have direct sensitivity. These simplified models feature a clear final state topology: All supersymmetry particles which do not directly enter the production and decay chain are effectively decoupled and at high mass scales, in sharp contrast to full models of supersymmetry, that have characteristic complex compositions of processes and final states. The relation of the relevant SUSY masses for the studied process can be chosen freely, which overcomes limitations of full models with few free parameters, like the constrained-MSSM. While the decomposition of a supersymmetry model scenario into different SMS is easily possible, interpreting a combination of different SMS results in any SUSY model is more difficult [53]. For example, analyses strongly dependent on data-driven background estimation methods can be subject to signal contamination in the control regions, which is usually irrelevant for an individual simplified model scenarios of a single process, but can significantly lower the sensitivity to full model scenarios of many supersymmetry processes.",

The spectrum of the various searches for supersymmetry are discussed, from very inclusive to very specific search strategies. In section 3 inclusive search strategies in the all-hadronic final state and with leptons are discussed, together with elementary standard procedures to model the SM background using the data. The results are discussed with respect to the simplified pair production of gluinos and light-flavour squarks and in the constrained MSSM. In section 4 gluino-mediated third generation squark production is discussed, while the direct production of third generation squarks is covered in section 5. Electroweak production of supersymmetric particles is presented in section 6, and gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios are presented in section 7. Resonances and signals with kinematic edges are discussed in section 8.1, before the experimental status of the searches for supersymmetry is summarized in the conclusion in section 9.",

Rare or unknown detector and reconstruction effects must be modeled sufficiently correct, like detector responses and noise, efficiencies and resolutions. The common way to avoid or at least reduce the influence of these effects and the corresponding systematic uncertainties, is to make use of the data itself. Data sideband regions, similarly affected by detector and reconstruction effects but depleted of signal can, appropriately weighted, be used instead of simulated samples, such that the systematic effects cancel out. Depending on the variable separating the signal and control regions, the weights for the control events can also be derived from the data: This is usually possible if the variable is uncorrelated to the kinematics of the event, as for example to a certain extent the particle identification criteria like lepton isolation or the b-tag probability. If a variable correlated with the kinematics is used to separate the regions, like the jet multiplicity or the hadronic activity H T in the event, MC simulations are usually required to derive the normalization of the control events. Depending on the details of the reweighting and the available MC statistics, this is comparable to using Monte Carlo simulation for the modeling of a background in the signal region, that was \"tuned\" by reweighting or validating it in a data sideband region. Exemplary data-driven background estimation methods for the all-hadronic final state are discussed in the following in more detail.",

Even though multijet events have no intrinsic E miss T , jet energy mismeasurements and misreconstructions summarized as jet energy resolution can lead to a sizable missing transverse energy tail. Typically, high-statistics data sideband regions are employed to model the QCD multijet background. These sidebands can be obtained by loosening a selection such as the E miss T requirement, a lepton identification, or for example a b-tagging qualifier. Alternatively, jet-resolution measurements derived from \u03b3+jets and dijets events can be used to create a high-statistics generated \"Pseudo-Monte Carlo\" QCD sample in a data-driven fashion: In a first step data events are selected similar to the signal selection criteria, except for the E miss T -cut. The reconstructed jets in every event are then varied in energy according to the jet-resolution probability density function (PDF), such that the E miss T in each event vanishes. In a second step, the jets are smeared again according to random numbers drawn from the jet resolution PDFs. Each seed event is used of the order of 100 times with different random numbers to minimize the statistical uncertainty of the sample. Signal contamination as well as contamination from other standard model backgrounds with genuine E miss T to the sample of proxy events is negligible because of the large QCD cross section and because the first rebalancing step transforms the contaminating events into QCD-like events. This \"rebalance + smear\"-method predicts the QCD multijet and other fully hadronic standard model backgrounds without genuine E miss T with a good precision.",

The background composition is dominated by W+jets and tt events, where the lepton is not identified and the event therefore passes the signal selection including the lepton-veto cut. This happens if the lepton is close to a jet or not-isolated, not properly reconstructed, or out of the geometrical acceptance region. These \"lost-lepton\" backgrounds are modeled using a data-control sample with exactly one isolated muon. The control sample can be enlarged using isolated electrons in addition to reduce statistical uncertainties at the price of larger systematics. To limit possible signal contamination to the control sample that could lead to an over-prediction, the control events are required to have small m T (l, E miss T ), typically less than 100 GeV consistent with W \u2192 l\u03bd from SM W+jets or tt backgrounds.

However, since the branching ratio of the Z to neutrinos is roughly three times larger than to electrons and muons, the prediction suffers from large statistical uncertainties especially in the high energy tails of the search variables, where the signal is expected. Better statistical precision is expected from W \u2192 l\u03bd events, which can be used as an alternative control sample.

Commonly used is therefore a \u03b3+jets control sample exploiting the similarity to Z+jets, which is given at high boson transverse momenta.

The analysis targets gluino mediated squark production and has also good sensitivity to gluino mediated stop production as discussed in the section 4 and to gluino mediated chargino\u03c7 \u00b1 1 or neutralin\u00f5 \u03c7 0 2 production as discussed in the following section 3.2, that all lead to many jets in the final state. The sensitivity of the analysis is enhanced by the sum of masses M \u03a3 jets of large radius jets in the event. These large radius jets are clustered by an anti-k t algorithm with a distance parameter R = 1 from the four-momenta of R = 0.4 anti-k t jets with p T > 20 GeV. The jet multiplicity, the b-tagged jet multiplicity, M \u03a3 jets , as well as the E miss T / \u221a H T variables are used to define 19 partially overlapping signal regions. For the QCD multijet background estimation the observation that the E miss T resolution is proportional to \u221a H T independently of the jet multiplicity is exploited: The E miss T / \u221a H T shape is extracted from data sidebands in the jet multiplicity, for each bin of b-tag multiplicity as the shape depends on the number of b-tags in the event. Soft unclustered energy in the event distorts the proportionality and leads to the largest systematic uncertainty on the QCD background estimation.",

The general advantage of these analyses is the reduced dependency on pileup, unclustered energy, and other detector effects that influence the E miss T in an event. Especially QCD multijet background events can acquire E miss T through these effects and are difficult to estimate. The alternative kinematic variables therefore offer a better handle to reduce or to estimate QCD multijet events.

The surviving QCD background is estimated from the \u2206\u03a6 min < 0.3 control region, scaled according to a transfer factor depending on M T 2 . Two analysis strategies are pursued for the all-hadronic final state at CMS [72]: An inclusive search for supersymmetry spans the signal region by the M T 2 variable, the jet and the b-tagged jet multiplicity, and by H T .

Each gluino undergoes an effective three-body decay into two quarks and the neutralino LSP. Again, two parameters define all experimental observables; the gluino mass and the neutralino mass. All hadronic inclusive searches follow different search and background estimation strategies with different strengths, setting the strongest limits in thegg and the light-flavorqq scenarios. The E miss T and 2 \u2212 6 jets analysis as well as the \u03b1 T and M T 2 analyses are expected to perform better for squark-pair production, where lower jet multiplicities but more energetic jets are produced, leading to an optimal performance of the hemisphere algorithms, compared to the 7 \u2212 10 jets and the E miss T + H T analyses, that perform best for gluinopair production with many jets in the final state. In the cMSSM this corresponds to low values of the universal scalar mass m 0 , where squark-pair production is dominant because m(q)<m(g) and high values of m 0 where m(g) m(q) leading to dominant gg production.

Also third generation squark production discussed in the following section can lead to lepton final states through top-quark decays. Direct electroweak slepton production offers usually no competitive sensitivity on slepton or gaugino masses compared to the indirect production through gluino-or squark decays, if the gluino or a squark mass is sufficiently small, or the slepton masses are not too light [67,68]. If the signal contains leptons, additional sensitivity compared to the inclusive all-hadronic analyses can be gained by the explicit selection of leptons. The branching fraction of neutralinos and charginos to leptons is usually smaller than to jets, but this is also true for the standard model background and a lepton in the final state simplifies the background estimation, because more possibilities for kinematically identical data sideband regions for the modeling of a background or for validation are offered.",

The reason for this is the non-trivial correlation of systematic uncertainties and most importantly the partially overlapping signal and control regions. Nevertheless, several ATLAS and CMS analyses have combined search channels and have been reinterpreted in several models of new physics beyond the standard model, e.g. [77,79].",

            "text": "A search for supersymmetry with at least one isolated electron or muon, jets, and E miss T [76] has been carried out by the ATLAS experiment on a dataset of 20 fb \u22121 . Different signal regions with optimal sensitivity to different signal scenarios have been defined: At least one low p T or one high p T lepton selection, e or \u00b5, offer complementary sensitivity to low and large mass splittings. Dilepton selections, ee, e\u00b5, or \u00b5\u00b5, cover different signal production modes and cascade decay chains. Various further criteria are applied individually in the signal regions, optimized for the different signal models. For example, small jet multiplicities are required for squark pair-production, large multiplicities for gluino production (Fig. 1). For gluino pair production dileptons are expected through decays via sleptons and sneutrinos or via intermediate gaugino decays as shown in Fig. 3. The dominant background originates from tt production. In the dilepton channels the SM tt is suppressed by applying a veto on b-tagged jets. The transverse mass m T , defined in Eq. (6) is used in all single-lepton regions to reject the subdominant background from W \u2192 l\u03bd. Similarly, the invariant dilepton mass m ll is used to reject Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 in dilepton regions, where no on-shell Z 0 -bosons are expected in the signal. The signal regions are defined orthogonal, except for the specifically designed inclusive single-lepton and low-p T dilepton regions. The binned variables m incl eff , E miss T , E miss T /m eff , and the Razor variable M R , defined in Eq. 9, are used to exploit the expected signal shape in order to optimize model-dependent limits. The dominant standard model backgrounds from tt, W+jets, and Z+jets are modeled by Monte Carlo simulation, which are normalized for the numerous signal regions in kinematically similar control regions, obtained e.g. by inverting the b-tag requirement, the m T , or the m ll selection. The normalization factors are constrained by a simultaneous fit based on the profile likelihood method to all control regions per signal region and are checked in multiple validation regions. Another nonnegligible background to signal-regions with leptons originates from QCD-multijet and Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets events, where the lepton requirement is fulfilled by non-prompt leptons or misidentified jets. This \"fake-lepton\" background can be estimated from the data, by measuring the lepton fake-rate f j\u2192e in events with loosely identified leptons and applying it to an appropriately weighted data control sample with the same requirements than the signal selection, except for the lepton identification. Since the fake-rate is usually orders of magnitude smaller than the lepton identification efficiency, the data-driven background estimation has small uncertainties of statistical origin due to the much larger control sample. The total uncertainties of the estimation is dominated by the sytematical uncertainty of f j\u2192e and on the quality of the kinematic similarity of the signal and the loose-lepton control region.",

Like-sign lepton final states are very rare in the standard model, but occur naturally in supersymmetry since, for example, the two decays chains of pair produced gluinos are not correlated. The dominant SM background therefore arises from misidentified \"fake leptons\", which are estimated from the data with loose lepton identification criteria. Rare standard model processes yielding like-sign dileptons like diboson production, ttV, and HV, where the V denotes a vector boson Z 0 or W \u00b1 , are estimated from Monte Carlo simulation. Four variables, that are able to discriminate signal against standard model backgrounds, are used to define several exclusive signal regions: E miss T , the scalar sum of hadronic transverse energy clustered in jets H T , the jet multiplicity, and the b-tagged jet multiplicity. For each variable two sets of regions are defined; one loose selection with depleted signal contribution in order to validate the SM background description, and one with tighter requirements where exclusive signal bins are defined. The analysis is carried out with two different p T thresholds for the two leptons of either 10 GeV each, or with thresholds of 20 GeV for both leptons. The low-p T selection increases the sensitivity to SUSY models with off-shell W-bosons. The H T threshold in this case is increased from 200 GeV to 250 GeV to ensure the full efficiency of the trigger. The high-p T selection is partially overlapping but has complementary sensitivity to scenarios with on-shell bosons. In addition to the results interpreted in the signal scenarios discussed in this section, the analysis uses the higher b-tag multiplicity regions and a low E miss T signal region to set limits on third generation squark production and R-parity violation models, respectively.",

The disadvantage of the small branching ratio can be compensated by a better handle on the separation and the description of the remaining standard model backgrounds. The search for gluino-mediated top-squark production in 19.3 fb \u22121 reported by CMS [83] is based on events with a single isolated lepton (electron or muon) and at least six high-p T jets, at least two of which are identified as b-jets. Two scenarios with on-or off-shell top squarksg \u2192 tt ( * ) are considered. In both scenarios the stop decays into a top quark and the neutralino LSPt ( * ) \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 . The final state contains four standard model top quarks and E miss T , which means that four jets originating from b-quarks and can be b-tagged. The probability that in at least one of the four W-bosons decays one charged lepton e or \u00b5 is created is 40%, well motivating the single lepton requirement. The SM background is dominated by tt processes, where large E miss T stems from the leptonic decay of a heavily boosted W-boson and b-tag multiplicities larger than two can originate from gluon splitting g \u2192 bb or mistagged jets. Contributions from W+jets and other rare diboson processes are suppressed by the high jet multiplicity requirement. Three complementary analysis strategies with respect to the chosen kinematic variables and data-sets are pursued: The first two methods rely on the evaluation of the E miss T distribution in bins of the amount of hadronic energy in the event H T . The E miss T shape of the remaining SM backgrounds is estimated in two independent ways. The missing transverse momentum template method (MT) determines a parametrized description of the E miss T distribution by fits to control regions at low-H T . The lepton spectrum method (LS) exploits the correlation of the direction of the lepton momentum and the p miss T originating from a neutrino from the same W \u2192 l\u03bd decay in the standard model background. Another independent method is based on the az-imuthal angle \u2206\u03a6(W, l) between the reconstructed W-direction and the lepton to separate a signal-depleted background dominated region at small \u2206\u03a6(W, l) \u2264 1. The \u2206\u03a6(W, l) variable is comparable to m T (l, E miss T ) with respect to the separation power of signal and standard model tt and W background, but has superior resolution in this analysis. The signal region is binned in S lep T = E miss T + leptons p T , which includes also signal events with low E miss T but high lepton momenta. The three different data-driven analysis strategies MT, LS, and \u2206\u03a6(W, l) increase the robustness of the search, while avoiding uncertainties due to potential mismodelling of SM simulation. Upper limits are set for gluino pair production withg \u2192 tt ( * ) , where each of the two top squarks decays into a top quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle, as shown in Fig. 7 in the gluino -neutralino LSP mass plane and in the gluino -stop mass plane.",

The single jet originates from initial state radiation and is balanced by E miss T , because the stopstop system decays into soft decay products, i.e. c-jets below the reconstruction threshold, and invisible neutralino LSPs. Few standard model processes have genuine monojet signatures, e.g. Z+jet where the Z decays into neutrinos. Hence, the largest part of the background originates from instrumental background, where objects are not reconstructed or identified, leaving missing energy in the detector and a jet. Events with large E miss T and one high p T jet are selected. More soft jets in the event are tolerated, as more than one ISR jet can be produced in the signal process, jets from other simultaneous ppcollisions (pileup) may be present, or one of the c-jets is reconstructed. For sufficiently large mass-splittings \u2206m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) 20 GeV the c-jets can receive enough transversal boost to be reconstructed. The monojet analysis [88, 91] is expanded by an orthogonal search region explicitly requiring the identification of one of the c-jets originating fromt 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 . A c-tagging algorithm is applied on the first four leading jets, as the c-jets are often softer compared to jets from initial state radiation or pileup. The algorithm employs multivariate methods to combine the information from the impact parameters of displaced tracks and topological properties of decay vertices reconstructed within the jet to produce a likelihood ratio for charm-jets, light-flavor or gluon jets, and b-jets. The medium working point has a ctagging efficiency of about 20% and rejection factors of about 8 and 200 for b-jets and light-flavor or gluon jets, respectively.",

            "text": "The measurement of the tt spin-spin correlation [104,105] is another example of standard model precision measurements with sensitivity to signals of new physics. Probing the correlation of the top spins expected for standard model pair-production of top quarks, offers a handle on the region \u2206m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) = m(t), without relying on the precise calculation of the SM tt crosssection. The standard model top-pair production process is dominated at low energy scales by the fusion of gluon pairs with the same helicities, leading to top quarks with antiparallel spins in the center-of-mass system. At large energy scales the gluons have opposite helicities, resulting in a top-pair with parallel spins [106,107]. In supersymmetry the spins of the top quarks, i.e. from the spin-0 stop decayst \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 , are not correlated. CMS analysis [105] analyzes the \u2206\u03c6-shape and is limited by the theoretical uncertainty on \u2206\u03c6. The corresponding ATLAS analysis [104] uses the \u2206\u03c6-distribution in combination with the SM tt-production cross-section prediction to extract a limit on th\u1ebd t 1t1 -production cross-section of approximately 20 pb, excluding t 1 -masses between the top-mass and 191 GeV for a simplified scenario with a branching fraction of 100% fort 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 and m(\u03c7 0 1 ) = 1 GeV. Alternatively, if thet 1t1 production is too similar to the standard model top production, searching for the production of the heavier stop mass eigenstatet 2t2 is viable [108]. The heavier state can decay into the lighter state and a Z-bosont 2 \u2192 Zt 1 . The analysis requires two leptons of opposite charge, same flavor and invariant mass consistent with an on-shell Z decay. Additional signal regions with three leptons help to suppress the SM tt background, where the third lepton in the signal may originate from the top-decay fromt 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 , or from other decay modes of the heavier stopt 2 \u2192 Ht 1 ort 2 \u2192 t\u03c7 0",

The stop mass is sufficiently heavy at low \u2206m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ) to produce on-shell top-quarks in addition to the neutralino LSP. The reconstruction of the stop decay products is similar efficient compared to standard model tt production. For larger values of \u2206m(t 1 ,\u03c7 0 1 ), the decay products become more boosted in the transverse plane, leading to more transverse momentum and more E miss T . This scenario in the parameter-space of stoppair production is almost comparable to generic strong production of supersymmetry, i.e. pair and associated production of squarks and gluinos. The difference aside from the cross section is that the visible energy in form of jets and leptons originates from two top-quarks, which offers an advantage. This provenance information can be used by specialized top-tagging search analyses to improve the signal sensitivity tott-production with respect to generic inclusive searches.",

The amount of energy in the final state is typically smaller compared to events with strong production, making a discovery of new physics in these channels more challenging. On the other hand, existing limits still allow rather light chargino and neutralino masses in contrast to squarks and gluinos. In the following, pair and associated production of charginos and neutralinos are considered, i.e.\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 2 which generally has the largest production cross-section depending on the mixing and the subdominant\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 \u00b1 1 production, as shown in Fig. 11. Pair production of neutralinos is also possible, e.g. through Higgs couplings. Since naturalness of supersymmetry requires light higgsinos, the lightest neutralinos and charginos are often assumed to be higgsino dominated in naturalness inspired models. Simplified model scenarios are used to describe four different scenarios, depending on the masses of the involved particles and the decay topology. Charginos and neutralinos can decay hadronically as discussed previously. Decay scenarios through the superpartners of leptons and neutrinos, the sleptonsl or\u03bd, or via the standard model bosons W \u00b1 , Z 0 , H are discussed in detail in the following.",

The generation of the intermediatel or\u03bd determines the flavor of the two leptons in each decay. The invariant mass of two charged leptons originating from the same gaugino exhibits a kinematic edge. This specific type of signal is discussed in more detail in Sec. 8.1. In the following, inclusive searches for electroweakly produced supersymmetry with leptons in the final state are discussed.

Accordingly, the probed signal models assume pure\u03c4 L and\u03bd \u03c4 mediated decays, where the firstand second generation sleptons and sneutrinos are too heavy to contribute to the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 2 decay widths. The \u03c4-leptons are difficult to identify experimentally. Leptonically decaying \u03c4leptons create soft electrons or muons and contribute to E miss T , hadronically decaying taus are reconstructed as jets and can be identified as \u03c4 using multi-variate methods, such as boosted decision trees or neural nets. The identification efficiency and the misidentification background rejection probability depend strongly on the working point and the number of charged tracks of the tau candidate jet as well as other kinematically correlated properties.  Searches with four charged leptons [122] complete the possible signal phase space with respect to the lepton multiplicity. Reasonable sensitivity can be achieved, which is best for scenarios with compressed spectra, where low lepton momentum thresholds are of advantage, but overall limited by the probability that all four leptons created in thel or\u03bd mediated decay of\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 2 or\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 \u00b1 1 production are charged and reconstructed in the geometrical and kinematic acceptance region.

The rich decay topology with four leptons, charged or neutral, of any flavor offers a variety of final states. The searches analyzing different final states are usually defined with exclusive search regions, allowing for all possible combinations. Statistical combinations [114,119] of different final states increase the sensitivity to certain signal scenarios.",

The dominant Higgs decay is H \u2192 bb, the corresponding signal region is defined by two additional b-tagged jets, suppressing SM backgrounds from W+jets and tt. These backgrounds with W \u2192 l\u03bd are further suppressed by requiring m T (l, E miss T ) > 100 GeV. Similarly for the rare H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay, two photons with an invariant mass consistent within 5 GeV of the standard model boson Higgs mass are required. A third channel with two likesign leptons (e or \u00b5) is considered [123], where in addition to the lepton from W \u2192 l\u03bd a second lepton from H \u2192 WW * , H \u2192 ZZ * , or H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 can be selected.

Additionally, the full supersymmetry model of general gauge mediation is used, where the neutralino NLSP is assumed to be either 100% bino-, wino-, or higgsino-like, which leads to a mixture of final states, in contrast to the studied SMS. The branching fraction of a bino-(or wino-) like neutralino in the GGM\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3G (or\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z 0G ) depends on m(\u03c7 0 1 ) and approaches cos 2 \u03b8 W if m(\u03c7 0 1 ) is large compared to m(Z 0 ) and similarly sin 2 \u03b8 W for\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z 0G (or\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 \u03b3G) [45], where \u03b8 W is the electroweak mixing angle. The different scenarios are shown in Fig. 13 and are discussed in detail in the following. 7.1. Strong production and bino-or wino-like\u03c7 0 1 NLSP Supersymmetric particles are produced through gluino or squark pair-or associated production, as discussed in Sec. 3, but unlike to e.g. models with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking, the cascade decays do not stop at the neutralino, but at the gravitino LSP. From the decays of the two neutralinos at least two standard model bosons are created, their type depends on the model scenario and in particular on the neutralino mixing. Two exemplary inclusive searches for the strong production of GMSB supersymmetry are presented, that require photons in the final state [125][126][127] and therefore implicitly binoor wino-like neutralino-mixings.",

While final states with single photons are ideal for wino-like neutralino mixing scenarios in the GGM, where photons in each \u03c7 0 1 decay are suppressed by sin 2 \u03b8 W for large m(\u03c7 0 1 ), they also exhibit good sensitivity to bino-like scenarios, where diphoton final states occur with about 64%, and single-photon final states with 32% probability. The two search strategies are also complementary with respect to the signal to SM background discriminating search variables: The single photon search uses bins in E miss T to search for a signal, while the diphoton analysis makes use of the Razor variables introduced in Eq. (11). The standard model background are dominated by \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3+jet and QCD-multijet production, where jets can be misreconstructed as photons. This background is estimated using the data sideband with loosely isolated photons or by a fit to the Razor variables shapes, respectively for 1\u03b3 and 2\u03b3. A subdominant background for the single-photon analysis arises from electrons misidentified as photons, when their track is not reconstructed or properly assigned to the candidate particle.

Analyses [108,129] have searched for direct stop-production ( Fig. 15(a)) in the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry models. The ATLAS search [108] for direct stop production with two leptons consistent with originating from a Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 decay has been discussed in Sec. 5.3. This search has sensitivity to GMSB supersymmetry with higgsinolike neutralinos, which decay like\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 HG and\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 ZG. The stop-higgsino search [129] assumes that only the supersymmetric partners of the top-quark and the Higgs boson (higgsino-like neutralino) are accessible, thus motivating direct stop pair production. In the stop decays standard model b-quarks viat 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and Higgs bosons H via\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 HG are created.

A feature of the analysis is the relative insensitivity to the details of the production process of the signal and the very reliable and precise estimation of the standard model backgrounds. Jets and a moderate amount of E miss same-flavor leptons (e, or \u00b5). The signal region at low-m ll is dominated by flavor-symmetric backgrounds such as tt production, i.e. this type of background produces as many e + e \u2212 +\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events as it has \u00b5 + e \u2212 + \u00b5 \u2212 e + events. Therefore, a data controlregion with two opposite-charged e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 leptons can be used to model the flavor-symmetric background.

The SM background is dominated by flavor symmetric tt processes, which are estimated with high precision using opposite-flavor data selections, as discussed previously. The sub-dominant background from SM Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 is here however of much larger importance, as it mimics the features of a signal resonance. Therefore, also this back- ground is evaluated using the data and validated in other data control regions. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the data-driven prediction. A similar technique as discussed for the QCD-multijet background estimation in allhadronic searches in Sec. 2.3 is used, exploiting that also in this case the E miss T in the Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 background is not due to genuine not-interacting particles, but created through a number of effects summarized as jet resolution. Therefore, a data control selection of Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 events is chosen, which satisfies all signal selection criteria except for E miss T , that is required to be small. The jets in these events are then smeared, according to the jet transverse momentum resolution, as a function of the azimuthal angle \u03c6 and the p T of the jet. The jet resolution function is determined using Monte Carlo simulation and tuned to the data based on a dijet p T balancing analysis. The E miss T is recalculated using the new smeared jets. The data-driven estimation of the resonant Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 background confirms that this background is negligible in the dilepton on-Z signal region with E miss T > 225 GeV and a scalar sum of jet and lepton p T of at least 600 GeV, as expected from MC simulation. The remaining small contribution from rare SM backgrounds like dibosonboson or top processes are taken from Monte Carlo simulation and are carefully validated in data-control regions.",

Some interesting fluctuations have been observed in individual search regions at ATLAS and CMS in 8 TeV and 13 TeV data, which are -unfortunatelybest explained by statistical fluctuations. Figure 19 shows a simplified summary of the observed significances of all counting-experiment channels of all published CMS supersymmetry results at \u221a s = 8 TeV until 2015. The significance of a given channel with N obs observed and N exp expected events is defined here as (N obs \u2212 N exp )/\u03c3 tot , where \u03c3 tot is a measure of the total uncertainty of the channel, quadratically combining the uncertainties of the background expectation and the data, ignoring all possible correlations. Only channels with N exp > 1.0 enter the plot, otherwise the large number of channels, where tiny fractions of background events are expected and no data events are observed, create a sharp peak at very small negative significances in the plot. The obtained distribution has a Gaussian shape with a mean consistent with zero and a width slightly smaller than unity, which could be caused by the neglected correlations. The largest absolute value of the significance in the plot is +2.6\u03c3 from the low-m ll counting experiment of the edge-analysis discussed above. The plot summarizes nicely the consistency of the observed data in the supersymmetry search channels with the expectations from the standard model background within the expected systematic and statistical fluctuations.",
