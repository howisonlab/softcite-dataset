As an example, in the production of B 0 mesons from excited charged B mesons decaying via strong interaction to B 0 \u03c0 + , the pion charge identifies the initial flavour of the B 0 meson. 1 A charge correlation can also arise from the hadronization process of the b quark. When a b and a d quark hadronize as a B 0 meson, it is likely that the corresponding d quark ends up in a charged pion (ud), or in an antiproton (u u d). The B 0 meson and the pion or antiproton are produced in nearby regions of phase space. Other algorithms used at LHCb, called opposite-side (OS) taggers [2,3], attempt to identify the flavour of the other b hadron produced in the same event.",

It is the figure of merit used to optimize the algorithms. Each algorithm provides a decision on the flavour of the B 0 candidate and an estimate of the probability \u03b7 that this decision is incorrect. The probability is used to determine a weight applied to the B 0 candidate, in order to maximize the tagging power of a sample of B 0 mesons in a time-dependent analysis. The probabilities provided by the two SS taggers are used to combine their decisions into the SScomb decision, which can be further combined with the decision of other taggers [2,3]. The expected relationship between the flavour of charged and neutral B mesons and the charge of the tagging particle is reported in Table 1.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. Regular reversal of the magnet polarity allows a quantitative assessment of detector-induced charge asymmetries. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Particularly relevant for this analysis is the identification of the different species of charged hadrons, which mainly relies on the information of two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. The first one covers the low and intermediate momentum region 2-40 GeV/c over the full spectrometer angular acceptance of 25-300 mrad. The second Cherenkov detector covers the high momentum region 15-100 GeV/c over the angular range 15-120 mrad [12].",

The following observables are used: the \u03c7 2 /ndf of the track fit, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom, the track transverse momentum p track T , the ratio between the track impact parameter with respect to the PV associated to the B 0 meson and the error on this variable IP/\u03c3 IP , the ratio between the track impact parameter with respect to any other PV in the event and its error IP PU /\u03c3 IP PU , the difference between the logarithms of the likelihood of the proton and pion hypothesis log L p \u2212 log L \u03c0 , or kaon and pion hypothesis log L K \u2212 log L \u03c0 . The likelihoods for the various mass hypothesis are determined using the track and the Cherenkov angle information, as described in Ref. [26]. For particles passing the loose selection criteria the efficiency to identify a pion is 89% with a kaon misidentification probability of 2%, while the efficiency to identify a proton is 92% with a pion misidentification probability of 5%. Since mutually exclusive particle identification criteria are imposed, a given tagging track is identified either as a pion or as a proton.

The multivariate classifiers used for the selection of the tagging particles are boosted decision trees (BDT) [27] using the AdaBoost [28] method to enhance and to increase the stability with respect to statistical fluctuations. This choice has been shown to be optimal with respect to the achievable tagging power. The classifiers take most of the above observables as input, as specified in Table 2. In addition the BDTs use the following variables: the momentum of the tagging particle p track , the transverse momentum of the B 0 candidate p B 0 T , the separation of tagging particle and the B 0 candidate R = \u03c6 2 + \u03b7 2 , and the number of tracks contributing to the PV fit PV tracks . The sWeights are used to subtract the contribution of background B 0 candidates in the training of the classifiers. The charge of the tagging particle determines  the flavour of the B 0 candidate. In case of multiple tagging particle candidates per B 0 candidate, the tagging particle with the highest BDT output value is chosen. The BDT outputs, \u03b1 BDT , are shown in Fig. 2. The global separation between signal and background is small, but enough to provide useful information to determine the flavour of the B 0 candidate, as shown below.",

In a second test, the signal mass model is replaced by a Hypatia function [35] convolved with a Gaussian function. The sum in quadrature of the variations of the calibration parameters observed in the two tests is taken as uncertainty on the mass model. Uncertainties related to the decay-time acceptance model are assessed by changing the number of nodes in the cubic splines from six to nine and are found to be negligible. A negligible uncertainty is associated to the decay-time resolution model. The mistag model uncertainties are assessed by comparing the calibration parameters derived in the nominal fit and those derived in fits with the mistag probability binned in categories. Five, seven and nine bins are tested and the largest observed variation of the parameters is taken as  a systematic uncertainty. Differences between the results of the two implementations of the time-dependent fit are due to the dependence of the mistag probability on the decay time.

This is the first time that protons are used to identify the flavour of a B 0 meson. The algorithms are optimized and calibrated on data using B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The calibration parameters of the taggers are reported in Table 3. The efficiency and mistag probability of the taggers depend on the kinematic properties of the B 0 decay mode under study. Estimated mistag probabilities match the true mistag fraction throughout the phase space. The new SS\u03c0 tagger provides a tagging power that is greater by 60% relative to the previous algorithm using pions, employed in Ref. [4].
