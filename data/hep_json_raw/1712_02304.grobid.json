Cross sections are measured for the main production modes in several exclusive regions of the Higgs boson production phase space and are interpreted in terms of coupling modifiers.

In addition, the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings is studied using an effective Lagrangian approach for the description of interactions beyond the Standard Model.

In the first approach, the Higgs boson production cross sections are analyzed based on different production modes in several exclusive regions of the production phase space, testing whether it is compatible with the SM predictions. An interpretation in terms of coupling modifiers within the \u03ba framework [14,15] is given, assuming a SM tensor structure (J P = 0 + ) for all couplings. In the second approach, the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings is studied, probing for admixtures of CP-even and CP-odd interactions in theories beyond the SM (BSM) in addition to the corresponding SM interactions. Both analyses are performed assuming that the studied resonance is a single particle state with spin-0 and a mass of 125.09 GeV based on experimental results obtained with the LHC Run-1 data [16]. It is assumed that the total width of the resonance is small compared the experimental resolution and the interference effects between the signal and SM backgrounds are neglected due to the small contribution.",

This set is obtained by the merging of those production bins of the original Stage-1 set from ref. [15] which cannot be measured separately in the H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4 channel with the current data sample. The gluon-gluon fusion process is split into events with zero, one or at least two particle-level jets. The particle-level jets are built from all stable particles (all particles with c\u03c4 > 1 mm) including neutrinos, photons and leptons from hadron decays or produced in the shower. All decay products from the Higgs boson, as well as the leptons and neutrinos from decays of the signal V bosons are removed, while decay products from hadronically decaying signal V bosons are included in the inputs to the JHEP03(2018)095 particle-level jet building. The anti-k t jet reconstruction algorithm [20], implemented in the FastJet package [21], with a radius parameter R = 0.4 is used and jets are required to have p T > 30 GeV. The 1-jet bin is further split into three bins with the Higgs boson transverse momentum p H T below 60 GeV, between 60 GeV and 120 GeV, and above 120 GeV. The reduced Stage-1 gluon-gluon fusion bins are correspondingly denoted by ggF-0j, ggF-1j-p H T -Low, ggF-1j-p H T -Med, ggF-1j-p H T -High and ggF-2j. The VBF production bin is split into two bins with the transverse momentum of the leading jet, p j1",

The model is based on an effective field theory description which assumes there are no new BSM particles below the energy scale \u039b. The cut-off scale \u039b is set to 1 TeV, supported by the current experimental results showing no evidence of new physics below this scale. The notation of eq. (3.1) follows the notation of eq. (2.4) in ref. [22] with X 0 defining a new bosonic state of spin 0 and with the difference that the dimensionless coupling parameters \u03ba are redefined by dividing them by cos \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the mixing angle between the 0 + and 0 \u2212 CP states implying CP-violation for \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = \u03c0. In this way the prediction for the SM Higgs boson is given by \u03ba SM = 1 and \u03ba Hgg = 1 with the values of the BSM couplings set to zero. In this analysis, only the effective Lagrangian terms with coupling parameters \u03ba HV V , \u03ba AV V and JHEP03(2018)095 \u03ba Agg are considered as possible BSM admixtures to the corresponding SM interactions.

The value of \u03b1 is arbitrarily set to \u03c0/4 such that the CP-odd couplings can be more simply denoted by \u03ba AV V tan \u03b1 \u21d2 \u03ba AV V and \u03ba Agg tan \u03b1 \u21d2 \u03ba Agg .",

The gluon-gluon fusion Higgs boson production is accurate to nextto-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling, using the POWHEG method for merging the NLO Higgs + jet cross section with the parton shower, and the MiNLO method [27] to simultaneously achieve NLO accuracy for inclusive Higgs boson production. A reweighting procedure, employing the Higgs boson rapidity, was applied using the HNNLO program [28,29]. The matrix elements of the VBF and VH production mechanisms were calculated up to NLO in QCD. For VH production, the MiNLO method was used to merge 0-and 1-jet events [30]. The gg \u2192 ZH contribution was modelled at leading order (LO) in QCD. The production of a Higgs boson in association with a top (bottom) quark pair was simulated at NLO with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v2. 2.3 (v2.3.3)  [31,32], using the CT10nlo PDF set [33] for ttH production and the NNPDF23 PDF set [34] for bbH production. For the ggF, VBF, VH and bbH production mechanisms, the PYTHIA 8 [35] generator was used for the H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4 decay as well as for the parton shower model using a set of tuned parameters called the AZNLO tune [36]. For the ttH production mechanism, the Herwig++ [37] event generator was used with the UEEE5 tune [38]. All signal samples were simulated for the Higgs boson with a mass m H = 125.00 GeV.

The simulation of tt + Z events with both top quarks decaying semi-leptonically and the Z boson decaying leptonically was performed with MadGraph interfaced to PYTHIA 8 and the total cross section was normalized to the prediction which includes the two dominant terms at both the LO and the NLO in a mixed perturbative expansion in the QCD and EW couplings [56]. The modelling of events containing Z bosons with associated jets was performed using the Sherpa 2.2.2 generator. Matrix elements were calculated for up to two partons at NLO and four partons at LO using Comix [69] and OpenLoops [70], and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [71] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [72]. The NNPDF3.0 NNLO PDF set was used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower parameters tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. Simulated samples were normalized to the data-driven estimate described in section 7. As a cross-check, this estimate was compared to the theory prediction obtained with FEWZ [82,83] at NNLO in \u03b1 s .",

Each electron (muon) must have a transverse impact parameter significance |d 0 |/\u03c3(d 0 ) below 5 (3) to suppress the background from heavy-flavour hadrons. Reducible background from the Z+jets and tt processes is further suppressed by imposing track-based and calorimeter-based isolation criteria on each lepton. The scalar sum of the p T of the tracks lying within a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 (0.2) around the muon (electron) is required to be smaller than 15% of the lepton p T (E T ). Similarly, the sum of the calorimeter E T deposits in a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 around the muon (electron) is required to be less than 30% (20%) of the lepton E T .

To improve the lepton pairing in such cases, a matrixelement-based pairing method is used for all events containing at least one additional lepton with p T >12 GeV and which satisfies the same identification and isolation criteria as the four quadruplet leptons. For all possible quadruplet combinations which pass the above selection, a matrix element for the Higgs boson decay is computed at LO using the MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [31] generator.

The ggF process is the major background in the 2-jet categories that are used to measure the cross section of the VBF and VH production modes. To estimate the QCD scale variation and migration effects on the n-jet ggF cross sections, the approach described in ref. [15] is used, which exploits the latest predictions for the inclusive jet cross sections and the exclusive jet bin fractions. In particular, the uncertainty from the choice of the factorization and renormalization scales, the choice of resummation scales, and the migrations between the 0-jet and 1-jet phase-space bins or between the 1-jet and \u2265 2-jet bins are considered. The impact of QCD scale variations on the Higgs boson p T distribution is taken into account as an additional uncertainty. The uncertainty in the Higgs boson p T at higher order originating from the assumption of infinite top and bottom quark masses in the heavy-quark loop is also taken into account by comparing the p T distribution predictions to finite-mass calculations. An additional uncertainty in the acceptance of the ggF process in VBF topologies due to missing higher orders in QCD in the calculation is estimated by variations of the resummation and factorization scales using fixed-order calculations with MCFM [106]. For the other production modes, the QCD scale uncertainties are obtained by varying the scale by factors of two. The configuration with the largest impact is chosen to define the uncertainty in each experimental category as the relative difference between the prediction in this and the nominal configuration.

Therefore, an uncertainty is assigned to the K-factor obtained from the SM samples. For this purpose, the K-factor for a given VBF and VH BSM process is evaluated as the ratio of NLO to LO event yields in simulated BSM samples, separately for each reconstructed event category. The uncertainty in the SM K-factor is then defined as the relative difference of the K-factors computed for the BSM and SM processes. The obtained uncertainties range from 10% to 40% depending on the category and are considered as being correlated across all categories.

The largest deviation of 2.2\u03c3 is observed for the Stage-0 VBF production bin due to an observed excess of events characterized by the presence of at least two jets and a dijet invariant mass above 120 GeV. Due to the limited number of events in the VH -and ttH -enriched categories, only upper limits are set on the cross sections and signal strengths for these production modes. The limits are based on the CL s prescription [110] and derived using pseudo-experiments. The VH and ttH parameters of interest are constrained to positive values to avoid the fit's prediction of negative total event yields in the VH -Lep-enriched and ttH -enriched categories and provide a stable fit configuration. It was found that the impact of this constraint on the final fit results is negligible.",

In the remaining three Stage-0 production bins, similar sources of uncertainty are relevant for both the cross section and the signal strength measurements: the jet energy scale or resolution uncertainties in all production bins and, additionally, jet bin migrations for the VBF and VH processes. For the reduced Stage-1 categories the dominant cross-section uncertainties are the integrated luminosity and lepton efficiency measurements for the ggF-0j and VH -Lep bins and the jet energy scale or resolution for all other categories. The VBF-p j T -Low bin is additionally affected by parton shower uncertainties, while the effects of the finite top quark mass have a dominant impact on the VBF-p j T -High bin, together with migrations between transverse momentum bins. The signal strength measurement of the reduced Stage-1 ggF processes is also strongly affected by the theory uncertainties from event migrations between different jet multiplicity and Higgs boson transverse momentum bins, while parton shower and QCD scale uncertainties affect the remaining reduced Stage-1 production bins. The cross-section results by production mode (Stage 0) can also be interpreted in the \u03ba framework [14,15] in which coupling modifiers, \u03ba i , are introduced to parameterize possible deviations from the SM predictions of the Higgs boson couplings to SM bosons and fermions. One interesting benchmark allows two different Higgs boson coupling strength modifiers to fermions and bosons, reflecting the different structure of the interactions of the SM Higgs sector with gauge bosons and fermions. The universal coupling-strength scale factors \u03ba F for all fermions and \u03ba V for all vector bosons are defined as \u03ba V = \u03ba W = \u03ba Z and \u03ba F = \u03ba t = \u03ba b = \u03ba c = \u03ba \u03c4 = \u03ba \u00b5 = \u03ba g . It is assumed that there are no undetected or invisible Higgs boson decays. The observed likelihood contours in the \u03ba V \u2212 \u03ba F plane are shown in figure 8(b) (only the quadrant \u03ba F > 0 and \u03ba V > 0 is shown since this channel is not sensitive to the relative sign of the two coupling modifiers). The compatibility with the Standard Model expectation is at the level of 1.4\u03c3. Better agreement is observed here compared to the likelihood contours for the cross sections, since the lower observed yield in the VH categories compared with SM expectations compensates for the observed excess in the VBF categories.
