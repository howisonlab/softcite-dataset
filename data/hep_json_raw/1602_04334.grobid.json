The search, which focuses on R-parity violating, chargino-mediated decays of the top squark, is performed in final states with low missing transverse momentum, two oppositely charged electrons or muons, and at least five jets. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2012. The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and upper limits are placed on the top squark pair production cross section at 95% confidence level. Assuming a 100% branching fraction for the top squark decay chain, t \u2192 t \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 \u00b1 + jj, top squark masses less than 890 (1000) GeV for the electron (muon) channel are excluded for the first time in models with a single nonzero R-parity violating coupling \u03bb ijk (i, j, k \u2264 2), where i, j, k correspond to the three generations.",

The mass of the top squark is expected to be within a few hundred GeV of the top quark mass, and the supersymmetric Higgs boson partners are also expected to have masses less than 1 TeV [5,6].",

The quantum number, R-parity, P R = (\u22121) 3B+L+2s has a value +1 for SM particles and \u22121 for superpartners, where B, L, and s are baryon number, lepton number, and spin, respectively [7]. In RPC models the top squark is expected to decay into the lightest SUSY particle, which escapes detection. This results in an event signature with substantial missing transverse momentum. Recent searches performed at the LHC at CERN in events with high missing transverse momentum have reduced the parameter space E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. available for a low mass top squark [8][9][10][11][12][13]. However, R-parity may not be conserved, in which case searches for SUSY particle decaying to SM particles without substantial missing transverse momentum are important.",

A notable feature of the CMS detector is its 6 m internal diameter superconducting solenoid magnet that provides a field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muon detectors based on gas ionization chambers are embedded in a steel flux-return yoke located outside the solenoid. Events are collected by a two-layer trigger system based on a hardware level-1 trigger, followed by a software-based high-level trigger.",

The energy from the reconstructed lepton and the average transverse energy density from pileup are subtracted from E T,cone , where pileup is defined as additional inelastic pp collisions within the same or the adjacent LHC bunch crossing. Tracking information together with calorimeter information is used to identify and subtract hadronic energy depositions from charged particles originating from pileup. The contributions to the neutral hadron and photon energy components due to pileup are also computed and subtracted. In the electron channel, the contributions to the neutral hadron and photon energy components due to pileup interactions are subtracted from E T,cone using the jet area technique [25], which computes the transverse energy density of neutral particles from the median of the neutral energy distribution in jets with p T > 3 GeV on an event-by-event basis. In the muon channel, the method assumes the pileup energy density from neutral particles to be half of that from charged hadrons, based on measurements performed in jets [24].",

This uncertainty ranges from 10 to 50%, depending on the values of N jets and of S min T . The uncertainties related to lepton trigger, identification, and isolation are negligible. For the small DY background, we take 50 (100)% of correction factor as the systematic uncertainty on the correction in 5 (\u22656) jet bin(s). We assign a 30% uncertainty to the diboson and single top quark background contributions to account for the difference between the NLO theoretical calculation and the CMS measurements of the WW and ZZ cross sections [53] and the single top cross sections [54]. The statistical uncertainty due to the finite size of the simulated background samples is 10-30%, depending on the N jets bin and S min T value. The following systematic uncertainties in the signal efficiency are included: jet energy scale (5%) [31], jet b-tagging efficiencies (3%), integrated luminosity (2.6%) [55], lepton identification and reconstruction efficiency (3%), electron energy scale (2%), muon momentum scale (0.9%), and trigger efficiency (1%). Note that the effect of the b-tagging uncertainty on the signal prediction is evaluated by varying the efficiency and misidentification rates by their uncertainties [32,56] and the effect on the signal prediction. The uncertainty related to the lepton isolation requirement for signal events with many jets is estimated using a tt control sample selected as shown in Table 1, but with \u22657 jets, and is determined to be 5%. The uncertainty due to the limited size of the simulated signal sample varies from 2 to 7%. The impact of uncertainties related to the PDF set choice, modeling of the top quark p T spectrum, and pileup modeling is determined to be negligible. Fig. 2 shows the observed distributions of jet multiplicity, the estimated background distributions, and the expected distributions for signals with a mass M t of either 300 GeV or 900 GeV. In Tables 3 and 4 we present the numbers of expected and observed events for each value of N jets , for each M t hypothesis and corresponding S min T value. The signal expectations are based on NLO cross sections [51]. The data are in agreement with the SM expectation in each bin.
