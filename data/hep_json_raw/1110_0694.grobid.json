To select pion and kaon candidates, we impose standard particle identification criteria [12]. The identification efficiencies and the misidentification probabilities are about 90% and 5%, respectively. In addition, we require loose proton veto criteria for kaon candidates and loose lepton veto criteria for pion candidates, since we found that a considerable fraction of background (23%) involves misidentified protons and leptons. D meson daughter particles are refitted to a common vertex and the D meson candidate is con-strained to originate from the e + e \u2212 interaction region. Confidence levels exceeding 10 \u22123 are required for both fits. In order to reject D mesons produced in B meson decays, the D meson momentum in the e + e \u2212 CM system must satisfy p * D > 2.5 GeV/c, for the data taken below \u03a5(5S), and p * D > 3.1 GeV/c for the \u03a5(5S) data.
