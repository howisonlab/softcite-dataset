            "text": "A search for pair production of massive vector-like T and B quarks in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV is presented. The data set was collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.6 fb \u22121 . The T and B quarks are assumed to decay through three possible channels into a heavy boson (either a W, Z or Higgs boson) and a third generation quark. This search is performed in final states with one charged lepton and several jets, exploiting techniques to identify W or Higgs bosons decaying hadronically with large transverse momenta. No excess over the predicted standard model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the T quark pair production cross section are set that exclude T quark masses below 860 GeV in the singlet, and below 830 GeV in the doublet branching fraction scenario. For other branching fraction combinations with B(T \u2192 tH) + B(T \u2192 bW) \u2265 0.4, lower limits on the T quark range from 790 to 940 GeV. Limits are also set on pair production of singlet vector-like B quarks, which can be excluded up to a mass of 730 GeV. The techniques showcased here for understanding highly-boosted final states are important as the sensitivity to new particles is extended to higher masses.",

            "text": "The discovery of a light mass Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3] motivates searches for new interactions and particles at the LHC [4]. Cancellation of the loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass without precise fine tuning of parameters requires new particles at the TeV scale. Such new particles are the bosonic partners of the top quark, in supersymmetric models, or the fermionic top quark partners predicted by many other theories, such as little Higgs [5,6] and composite Higgs [7][8][9][10] models. These heavy quark partners predominantly mix with the third-generation quarks of the standard model (SM) [11,12] and have vector-like transformation properties under the SM gauge group SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y \u00d7 SU(3) C , hence the term \"vector-like quarks\" (VLQ). While a chiral extension of the SM quark family has been strongly disfavored by precision electroweak studies at electron-positron colliders [13,14] and by observed production cross sections and branching fractions of the Higgs boson [15], models with VLQs are not excluded by present data. We search for a vector-like T quark with charge 2/3 (in units of the electron charge) that is produced via the strong interaction in proton-proton collisions along with its antiquark, T. Many models in which VLQs appear assume that T quarks decay to three final states: bW, tZ, or tH [16]. Leading-order Feynman diagrams of these three processes are shown in figure 1, created with the tools of ref. [17]. The partial decay widths depend on the particular model [18], so that the branching fractions of these decay modes can take on various possible values, with the sum of all three branching fractions equal to unity. An electroweak isospin singlet T quark is expected to have a branching fraction of approximately 50% for T \u2192 bW, and 25% for each of T \u2192 tZ and tH, and is used as a benchmark for figures and tables. A T quark in a weak isospin doublet has no decays to bW and equal branching fractions for tZ and tH decays [18][19][20]. As these are, however, not the only possible representations of T quarks, the final results are interpreted for many allowed branching fraction combinations.",

The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The momentum resolution for electrons with transverse momentum p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays ranges from 1.7% for low-bremsstrahlung electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [31]. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [32]. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momenta measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zerosuppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.",

Jet momentum is defined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. All jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.5 and AK4 (AK8) jets must have p T > 30 (200) GeV. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) [35]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon/Z(\u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5) + jet events [36]. A smearing of the jet energy is applied to simulated events to mimic the energy resolution observed in data, typically 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in the HCAL [37], anomalously high energy deposits in certain regions of the ECAL, and cosmic ray and beam halo particles that are detected in the muon chambers.",

The event must satisfy a single-electron or singlemuon trigger. The choice of triggers is adapted to the particular final state targeted in each channel. In T \u2192 bW decays, the W boson is generally well separated from the associated bottom quark since the T quark has low p T compared to its mass, leading to a low level of hadronic activity in close proximity to the lepton. In contrast, a lepton originating from a top quark decay (e.g., from a T \u2192 tH decay) becomes increasingly collinear with the associated bottom quark as the T quark mass increases and the Lorentz boost of the top quark rises. As a consequence of the above, the boosted W channel uses triggers selecting leptons that are isolated with respect to nearby PF candidates, either electron candidates with p T > 27 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1, or muon candidates with p T > 20 GeV. The triggers used in the boosted H channel do not require that the leptons are isolated. In the electron channel, events with at least one electron candidate with p T > 45 GeV, one AK4 jet with p T > 200 GeV, and another AK4 jet with p T > 50 GeV are selected by the trigger.

In the W + jets control region, the requirement of at least one b-tagged jet is inverted and events with any b-tagged jets are rejected. Events with an H-tagged jet are rejected in both control regions to reduce the signal contribution in these regions, and E miss T > 100 GeV is required to reject events from multijet production. The signal to background ratio is about six times smaller than the one in the H2b category in the tt control region and about 30 times smaller in the W + jets control region. Events are corrected for all known sources of discrepancies between the data and simulation such as differing reconstruction or tagging efficiencies. It is observed that jets have a harder p T spectrum in simulation, leading to significant discrepancies from observed distributions of quantities such as H T . The discrepancies in both control regions are well described by 2-parameter linear fits with negative slopes to the ratio between data and simulation in the H T distributions [65,66]. Modeling of the tt and W + jets background samples is corrected using the results of these fits. The S T distributions for both control regions are shown in figure 4 with all corrections applied.",

Events are selected that have one electron or muon, usually from the decay of a W boson in the T \u2192 bW decay mode or from a leptonic top quark decay in the T \u2192 tZ or tH decay modes. Electrons (muons) must have p T > 40 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.1 (2.4) and pass the tight identification and isolation requirements described in section 4. Events having additional loose electrons or muons with p T > 10 GeV are rejected. Each event must have three or more AK4 jets, and the three highest p T jets must satisfy p T > 300, 150, and 100 GeV, respectively. Since a neutrino is expected from a leptonic W boson decay, E miss T is required to be greater than 75 GeV, which also significantly reduces the background from multijet events. Control regions are separated from the signal region based on the angular separation between the lepton and the second-highest p T jet in the event, \u2206R( , j 2 ). In both TT and background processes, the lepton is usually observed back-to-back with the highest transverse momentum AK4 jet, and in TT events the secondhighest p T jet also tends to be back-to-back with the lepton, as seen in figure 5. The signal region selection requires \u2206R( , j 2 ) > 1. Figure 5 shows the distribution of \u2206R( , j 2 ) after all selection requirements except for \u2206R( , j 2 ) > 1.

It can be seen that the selection applied in the boosted H channel is most efficient if a Higgs boson is present in the final state, whereas the selection in the boosted W channel favors T \u2192 bW decays, thus showing how the combination of the two channels improves sensitivity to most branching fraction combinations of the T quark. For B quark decays the boosted W channel has high efficiency for the tW decays and reduced efficiency for the bZ/bH decays owing to the lack of semileptonic top quark decays. Similarly, the boosted H channel is most efficient for the bHtW final state since a leptonic decay is required as well as an H-tag.",

For a doublet T quark, the observed (expected) upper limits on the production cross section range from 0.37 to 0.04 pb (0.34 to 0.03 pb) and we exclude masses below 830 GeV (780 GeV). The corresponding benchmarks for B quark production are shown in figure 13, and we can exclude masses below 730 GeV (720 GeV expected) for the singlet branching fraction combination while for the doublet scenario, no lower mass limit above 700 GeV was observed. Sensitivity to BB production in this search is limited by the single lepton selection efficiency for bZ and bH decays, as noted above. The combinations benefit from the difference in discriminating variables between the channels: the boosted W channel provide good sensitivity to low-mass T quarks, while the peaking signal shape in the S T distribution drives the combination at high masses. The observed exclusion limits are stronger than expected due to an over-prediction of the background that remains after the H T -based reweighting, particularly in categories with a W-tagged jet and several b-tagged jets. This effect is not significant given the systematic uncertainty in the reweighting procedure. Figure 14 shows expected and observed exclusion limits at 95% CL on the T quark mass, for a scan of possible branching fractions: we set lower mass limits with values ranging from 790 to 940 GeV for combinations with B(T \u2192 tH) + B(T \u2192 bW) \u2265 0.4. Compared to the combination of many leptonic and hadronic search channels in \u221a s = 8 TeV collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , the current combination of two single lepton channels produces similar expected exclusion limits. This represents an improved sensitivity to TT pair production at \u221a s = 13 TeV due to the increase in the TT production cross section from 8 to 13 TeV as well as to significant improvements in techniques for identifying boosted hadronic massive-particle decays. For branching fraction scenarios with B(T \u2192 tH) + B(T \u2192 bW) \u2265 0.4 these results extend the excluded mass range of the 8 TeV search by up to 160 GeV.",
