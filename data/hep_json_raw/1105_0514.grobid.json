These states, called X, Y, Z, are candidates for exotic mesons beyond the conventional quark-antiquark model (qq). Possible interpretations are quark-gluon hybrids (qqg), four-quark states (qqqq), molecular states composed of two usual mesons, glueballs, et cetera.",

Consisting of two vector mesons (positive C-parity), the final state J/\u03c8\u03c6 is a good channel to search for an exotic meson. The observed excess would be the first charmonium-like structure decaying into two heavy quarkonium states (cc and ss). Because the mass in this channel is high enough for open charm decays, an explanation as charmonium state is very unlikely for a narrow structure. A search near the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 threshold is also motivated by the closeness of the Y (3930) to the J/\u03c8 \u03c9 threshold. Some of the possible exotic explanations for the Y (4140) are discussed in Ref. 3.",

Thereby, the reconstructed J/\u03c8 and \u03c6 masses are required to lie within 50 MeV/c 2 (J/\u03c8) respective 7 MeV/c 2 (\u03c6) of the corresponding world average values. The combinatorial background can be reduced significantly with a higher threshold of the B + decay length in the transverse plane (L xy (B + )) to exploit the long B meson lifetime. In addition, a kaon identification quantity can be used to obtain a further background reduction by separating the final state kaons from the dominant pion background. For that purpose, the information about the ionization energy loss dE/dx in the drift chamber and the information from the Time-of-Flight detector are combined in a log-likelihood ratio LLR Kaon . The cuts L xy (B + ) > 500 \u00b5m and LLR Kaon > 0.2 are chosen by optimizing the quantity S/ \u221a S + B, where S and B are the numbers of B + signal and background events, respectively. After both requirements, a background reduction factor of approximately four orders of magnitude is accomplished. Figure 1(a) shows the resulting J/\u03c8\u03c6K + mass spectrum. A fit with a Gaussian signal and a linear background function yields 115 \u00b1 12 signal events, corresponding to a 53% increase over the previous analysis. For the examination of the J/\u03c8\u03c6 spectrum, only candidates within \u00b13\u03c3 (\u00b117.7 MeV/c 2 ) around the nominal B + mass are selected. Furthermore, sideband events within [\u22129, \u22126]\u03c3 and [+6, +9]\u03c3 around the nominal B + mass are used to model the combinatorial background in the J/\u03c8\u03c6 spectrum. Figure 1 ",
