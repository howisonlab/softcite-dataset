            "text": "If the couplings of the W to quarks and leptons are indeed specified by a single gauge coupling, then for universality to be observed as the equivalence of the Fermi constant G F as measured in muon and hadron decays, the CKM matrix must be unitary. Currently, the most stringent test of CKM unitarity is obtained from the first-row relation |V ud | 2 +|V us | 2 +|V ub | 2 = 1+\u2206 CKM . During the period spanning 2003 to 2010, a wealth of new measurements of K \u21133 and K \u21132 decays and steady theoretical progress made possible precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) based on this relation. In a 2010 evaluation of |V us |, the FlaviaNet Working Group on Kaon Decays set bounds on \u2206 CKM at the level of 0.1% [1], which translate into bounds on the effective scale of new physics on the order of 10 TeV [15]. Since 2010, there have been a few significant new measurements and some important theoretical developments. Among the latter, advances in algorithmic sophistication and computing power are leading to more and better lattice QCD estimates of the hadronic constants f + (0) and f K / f \u03c0 , which enter into the determination of |V us | from K \u21133 and K \u00b52 decays, respectively. In addition, two groups working on the classification and averaging of results from lattice QCD [2,3] have joined their efforts, forming the newly formed Flavor Lattice Average Group (FLAG-2) to provide recommended values of these constants [11].",

There have been no new branching ratio (BR) measurements since the 2010 review. On the other hand, both the KLOE and KTeV collaborations have new measurements of the K S lifetime, \u03c4 K S . The KLOE measurement [4] is based on the vertex distribution for K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L events. The new KTeV result [5] comes from a comprehensive reanalysis of the \u03c0\u03c0 vertex distributions in the experiment's regenerator beam. This analysis can be performed with or without assuming CPT symmetry. The present update makes use of the new KTeV values for \u03c4 K S and Re \u03b5 \u2032 /\u03b5 (which enters the fit for the K L rates by providing an effective measurement of BR(\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )/BR(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )) obtained without the CPT assumption. The largest effect of these updates is to reduce the uncertainty on \u03c4 K S , the value of which changes from 89.59(6) ps [1] to 89.58(4) ps. The NA48/2 experiment has recently released preliminary results for the form factors for both K \u00b1 e3 and K \u00b1 \u00b53 decays [6].

However, it is possible to fit approximately equivalent values of \u039b + and lnC to the NA48/2 measurements of (\u03bb \u2032 + , \u03bb \u2032\u2032 + , \u03bb 0 ) using the expressions in the appendix of [7] and the observation that \u03bb 0 \u2248 \u03bb \u2032 0 + 3.5\u03bb \u2032\u2032 0 [8]. This is important because it helps to resolve a controversy: the older measurements of the K \u00b53 form factors for K L decays from NA48 [9] are in such strong disagreement with the other existing measurements that they have been excluded from the FlaviaNet averages [1]. The new NA48/2 measurements, on the other hand, are in good agreement with other measurements, as seen from Fig. 1. Including the new NA48/2 results, appropriately converted for the current purposes, the dispersive average becomes \u039b + = (25.75 \u00b1 0.36) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , lnC = 0.1895(70), with \u03c1 = \u22120.202 and P(\u03c7 2 ) = 55%.

More significant is a new calculation of the corrections to the ratio \u0393(K \u00b1 \u00b52 )/\u0393(\u03c0 \u00b1 \u00b52 ) for isospin breaking [14], which for the first time takes into account the effects of strong isosping breaking, in addition to the long-distance electromagnetic corrections. While the magnitude of the total correction is nearly doubled, the contribution to the uncertainty from the correction is increased by only about 20%. The resulting value for |V us /V ud | is 0.2317 (11).",

The new measurements of \u03c4 K S and the K \u21133 form factor parameters have virtually no effect on the final result. While there is a small effect from the inclusion of the new lattice estimate for f K / f \u03c0 in the FLAG-2 average, the largest single influence is from the new correction to the ratio \u0393(K \u00b52 )/\u0393(\u03c0 \u00b52 ) for the effects of strong isospin breaking. This underscores a simple fact: so much work has been done to increase the precision of the experimental inputs to |V us | that, for the moment at least, further experimental progress is difficult. The measurements that offer the most room for improvement are the BRs for the K \u21133 decays of the K S and of the K \u00b1 , and in the case of K \u00b1 , to be useful, better BR measurements would also require a more precise theoretical estimate for \u2206 SU (2) . But while the experimental quantities |V us | f + (0) and |V us /V ud | \u00d7 f K / f \u03c0 have been measured to within about 0.2%, the precision of the unitarity test is currently determined by the uncertainties on the lattice results for f + (0) and f K / f \u03c0 , which are at the level of 0.5%. Thus, at the moment, the lattice offers the most certain prospects for further improvement. Results for f + (0) and f K / f \u03c0 with precison at the level of 0.2% may be available as early as 2014, and continued progess is expected thereafter [16].",

The ratio R K of the widths (inclusive of internal bremsstrahlung) for K e2 to K \u00b52 decays depends only on kinematic factors and radiative corrections-the form factor f K cancels from the ratio, and the uncertainty on the expected value is very small: R K = 2.477(1) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [17]. These features-a BR suppressed in the SM and a precisely known SM rate-make the decay interesting in the precision-based search for evidence of new physics. A specific motivation for new measurements of R K is that in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with R parity, there may be a percent-level contribution to the K e2 rate from the H + -mediated amplitude with lepton-flavor violation in the one-loop effective coupling at the H + \u2192 e + \u03bd vertex (i.e., with \u03bd = \u03bd \u03c4 ), depending on the values of tan \u03b2 , m H + ,and the mass insertion |\u2206 31 R | in the loop [18]. The first modern measurement of R K was performed with the KLOE experiment [19]. The K \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 decay vertices were reconstructed in the drift chamber with tight quality cuts. The event selection was refined using the missing mass at the vertex (M 2 \u2113 = m 2 \u03bd = 0 for signal events) and a neural network for e/\u00b5 separation in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The event counting was performed by a two-dimensional likelihood fit in the plane of M 2 \u2113 vs. the neural network output. On the basis of about 14k events, KLOE measured R K = 2.493(25) stat (19) syst , i.e., with an uncertainty of about 1.2%. KLOE was also able to isolate K e2\u03b3 events with structure-dependent (SD+) radiation well enough to fit the E \u03b3 spectrum to determine the parameters for the O(p 4 ) chiral-perturbation-theory representation of the form factor.",

            "text": "The NA62 experiment, a successor to NA48 the goal of which is to measure the rare K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd decay, benefits from much higher statistics from the 75-GeV kaon beam and easier e/\u00b5 separation at high energies with the NA48 liquid krypton calorimeter (LKr). In 2007, NA62 collected nearly 150k K e2 decays in a dedicated run. For the analysis, a cut on the E/p ratio for decay tracks (with E measured in the LKr and p reconstructed in the dipole spectrometer) provides \u00b5 rejection at the level of 10 \u22126 . The probability for muons to lose enough energy in the LKr via catastrophic bremsstrahlung to be mistaken for electrons is estimated using data from runs in which part of the LKr acceptance was blocked to electrons with a thick lead shield. Event counting is performed by fitting the M 2 \u2113 distributions. In 2011, NA62 published a result based on a 40% subsample of the data collected: R K = 2.487(13) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [20]. The full sample has now been analyzed and the final result made public: R K = 2.488(7) stat (7) syst \u00d7 10 \u22125 [21]. This result has 0.4% precision and is in agreement with the SM prediction. For the subtraction of the background from the SD+ component of the radiative channel K e2\u03b3 , the NA62 measurement makes use of the KLOE measurement mentioned above. NA62 has performed its own measurement of the SD+ component in the works and preliminary results have been shown [22]. The new NA62 result essentially determines the new world average: R K = 2.488(9) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . The regions in the (m H + , tan \u03b2 ) plane excluded at 95% CL by the agreement of this value with the SM prediction are shown in Fig. 2 for different values assumed for |\u2206 31 R | in the MSSM.",
