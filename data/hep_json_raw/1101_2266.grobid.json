One can calculate the neutrino energy spectrum of each isotope by summing all fission fragment \u03b2-decay branches. There are a lot of efforts on such studies. However, the fission products are very complex. Due to lack of accurate nuclear data, such calculations carry large uncertainties at the 10% level. The most accurate neutrino spectra of the first 3 isotopes were determined at ILL [12] by measuring the \u03b2 spectra of fissioning. The \u03b2 spectra are then converted to neutrino spectra, with an average uncertainty 1.9%. The 238 U spectrum are calculated theoretically [13]. They are shown in Fig. 1. The isotope concentration in fuel will evolve during reactor operation as 235 U depletes and 239 Pu and 241 Pu breed. The 238 U concentration is relatively stable. Such evolution can be obtained by core simulation. A typical isotope evolution as a function of operation time, in terms of fission rates of the reactor, is shown in Fig. 2.",

Energy release per fission varies slightly for different cores at different time due to neutron capture and non-equilibrium products.

The power measurements can be more accurate than what were cited in the past reactor neutrino experiments. The uncertainties of the Secondary Heat Balance is dominated by the flow rate measurement. In the past, there are two kinds of widely used flow meters, venturi type flow meters and orifice plate flow meters. Venturi flow meters are used by most US and Japan reactors. The uncertainty is often 1.4%. It can be as low as 0.7% if properly calibrated and maintained. But they suffer from fouling effects, which could grow as high as 3% in a few years. To improve the measurement, ultrasonic flow meters have begun to be in use in some US and Japan reactors. They have uncertainties 0.45% for Type I and 0.2% for Type II [15]. The Orifice plate flow meters are used by French reactors. They have no fouling effects. Typically they have an uncertainty of 0.72% and could be improved to 0.4% with laboratory tests. It should be noted that the uncertainties of above flow meters are at the 95% C.L. (confidence level), as defined in ISO-5167. Unless specified, the thermal power uncertainty given by the power plant is also at 95% C.L.",

Main components of the uncertainties are shown in Table 1. It is dominated by the discharge coefficient, which is an empirical formula in the flow rate measurement and its uncertainty is specified in ISO 5167-1-2003. The final uncertainty of the thermal power is 0.40% at 95% C.L. In this evaluation, it is assumed that the discharge coefficients of the orifice plates in four coolant loops are independent, thus the final uncertainty is statistically reduced. If the discharge coefficients are fully correlated for all four orifice plates, then there is no statistical reduction. The power uncertainty will be 0.37% at 1\u03c3 level, which is still significantly smaller than 0.7% that Chooz used. The Daya Bay and Ling Ao reactors are all calibrated with the SAPEC system, which is an EDF portable high precision secondary heat balance test system with its own sensors, databases, and data processing, of uncertainty of 0.45%. The calibration results of Ling Ao reactors can be found in Table 2  [23]. Four tests show differences from 0.031% to 0.065%. Such small differences mean that the secondary heat balance system (KME) of the reactor is strongly correlated with the SAPEC system. Actually, the calibrations use the same orifice plates but different pressure transmitters. It proves again that the power uncertainty is dominated by the discharge coefficient. It also shows that Ling Ao KME is in very good agreement with the SAPEC system. The power uncertainty is estimated to be 0.48% at 95% C.L. in this comparison. As with the above example, these analyses assumed that the discharge coefficients are uncorrelated, which may not be the case.",

            "text": "The fission fraction of fuel isotopes are obtained by core simulation. Qualified core simulation codes are normally licensed, and not available to scientific collaborations. The core simulation also needs a lot of information from the power plant as inputs. Fortunately, the fission fraction can be extracted as a by-product of the refueling calculation required by the power plant, as a function of burn-up. The uncertainties of the obtained fission fraction depends on the simulation code. It only slightly depends on the inputs such as temperature, pressure, Boron concentration, etc. [24], as tested by the simulation code ROCS. The uncertainties of the simulation can be studied by comparing the measured and calculated concentration of fuel isotopes sampled at different burn-up when refueling. These studies are normally a part of the qualification of the licensed simulation code. In ref. [15], 159 such studies for various codes and various reactors in US and Japan haven been collected and analyzed. On average, the simulated concentration of isotopes have uncertainties of \u223c4% for 235 U, \u223c5% for 239 Pu, \u223c6% for 241 Pu, and \u223c0.1% for 238 U. Assuming the simulated neutron flux in the core is not affected by small variations of isotope concentration, the fission rate is proportional to the isotope concentration. Due to the strong constraint of the total thermal power, simulated concentrations of the foure isotopes are not independent. A 5% error on the isotope concentration corresponds to a \u223c0.5% uncertainty on the detected neutrino rate via inverse \u03b2-decay reaction. There also are large core-to-core correlations for reactors simulated with the same code. The energy release per fission e i in Eq. 1 is defined as the energy absorbed in the reactor per fission event. Neutrinos will take away energy from the total energy released in a nuclear fission. Some fission fragments of long lifetime will not reach equilibrium in a short time, thus part of the energy is not released. Each fission will produce 2-3 neutrons while only one neutron will be used to maintain the chain reaction at stable state in reactor running. Other neutrons are absorbed and release energy via neutron capture. As the fuel composition evolves, the contribution of neutron capture will change. Taking the above three corrections into account, e i varies slightly for different reactors and it changes with time. Average e i 's were evaluated for typical reactor configurations in refs. [16] and [17]. A more accurate estimation of e i as a function of burn-up can be obtained from core simulation, where these corrections are included automatically. ",

Motivated by high precision neutrino measurements by scientific collaborations and power uprates by the power plants, we have more accurate thermal power. The uncertainty could be lowered from 0.7% to 0.4%. Small corrections from non-equilibrium isotopes and spent fuel, as well as energy release per fission are studied in detail. We also have a global picture of uncertainties of fission rate simulations. However, there is no new data on neutrino spectra of fuel isotopes. For single-detector experiments, the neutrino spectrum uncertainty of about 2% will dominate. The next \u03b8 13 experiments with near-far relative measurements will suffer little from reactor flux uncertainties, which is estimated to be 0.1% to 0.45%, depending on the experiment layout. The correlation among reactor uncertainties is important for \u03b8 13 experiments since correlated errors will cancel out. Meanwhile, high precision detector and high statistics at the near detector of these experiments may help to improve the knowledge of neutrino spectra.",
