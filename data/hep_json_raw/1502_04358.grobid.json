The first is an inclusive search based on signal regions defined by the value of the M T2 variable, the hadronic energy in the event, the jet multiplicity, and the number of jets identified as originating from bottom quarks. The second is a search for a mass peak corresponding to a Higgs boson decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair, where the Higgs boson is produced as a decay product of a SUSY particle. For both searches, the principal backgrounds are evaluated with data control samples. No significant excess over the expected number of background events is observed, and exclusion limits on various SUSY models are derived.",

An example is supersymmetry (SUSY) with R-parity conservation [2], in which pair-produced SUSY JHEP05 (2015)078particles each decay to SM particles and to a massive, neutral, weakly interacting lightest SUSY particle (LSP), which escapes without detection. The value of M T2 reflects the masses of the pair-produced particles, which are much lighter for SM background processes than expected for SUSY particles such as squarks and gluinos. The M T2 variable was previously used for top-quark mass measurements by the CDF and CMS experiments [3,4], and for SUSY searches by the CMS [5,6] and ATLAS [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] experiments. This paper describes searches for physics beyond the SM performed using a data sample of pp collisions collected in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The size of the sample, measured by its integrated luminosity, is 19.5 fb \u22121 .",

            "text": "Two different M T2 -based searches are presented. The first search, called the inclusive-M T2 search, employs several signal regions defined by the number of jets (N j ), the number of tagged bottom-quark jets (N b ), the value of M T2 , and the hadronic energy in an event. This general search aims to cover a large variety of SUSY and other new-physics signatures. The second search, called the M T2 -Higgs search, is a specialized analysis targeting events with a Higgs boson produced in the decay of a heavy SUSY particle. The SM Higgs boson decays primarily to a bottom quark-antiquark (bb) pair. For a large variety of SUSY models, the lightest Higgs boson (h boson) has SM properties, especially if the masses of all other SUSY Higgs bosons are much larger. In the M T2 -Higgs search, we therefore search for an excess of events at the SM Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV in the invariant mass distribution of b-tagged jet pairs. The two searches rely on similar selection criteria for the M T2 variable to enhance the sensitivity to a potential SUSY signal and to reduce the background from SM multijet events to a minimal level. The remaining SM background consists mostly of Z+jets events where the Z boson decays to neutrinos, and W+jets and tt +jets events where one W boson decays leptonically. These backgrounds are mostly estimated by methods using data.",

In this analysis, all visible objects, such as jets, are clustered into two pseudojets. For this purpose, we use the hemisphere algorithm defined in section 13.4 of ref. [20]. The algorithm is seeded by the two jets with largest dijet invariant mass. The clustering is performed by minimizing the Lund distance measure [21,22]. Standard model multijet events, interpreted as two pseudojets, may give rise to large M T2 if both pseudojets have large masses. Setting m vis(i) = 0 in eq. (2.1) suppresses the multijet contributions without affecting signal sensitivity, since the kinematic terms of eq. (2.1) are large for most newphysics scenarios. In the following, M T2 is computed using E vis(i) T , p T vis(i) (i = 1, 2), and p miss T , setting both m vis(i) terms in eq. (2.1) to zero. Although most the background from SM multijet events is thus characterized by small values of M T2 , a residual background at large M T2 arises from multijet events in which the two pseudojets are not back-to-back because of jet energy mismeasurements. Further selection criteria are applied to suppress these events, as discussed in section 4.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The detector is nearly hermetic, covering JHEP05(2015)078 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth, and thus allows the measurement of momentum balance in the plane transverse to the beam direction. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate, from around 100 kHz to around 300 Hz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [23].",

Background events are generated with the MadGraph 5 [24], pythia 6.4.26 [22], and powheg 1.0 [25] programs. Signal event samples based on simplified model scenarios (SMS) [26] are generated using the MadGraph 5 program, with the decay branching fractions of SUSY particles set either to 0% or 100% depending on the SUSY scenario under consideration. We also generate signal events in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric SM (cMSSM/mSUGRA) [27]. The cMSSM/mSUGRA events are generated using the pythia program, with the sdecay [28] program used to describe the SUSY particle decay branching fractions and the softsusy [29] program to calculate the SUSY particle mass spectrum. The pythia program is used to describe the parton shower and hadronization. While all generated background samples are processed with the detailed simulation of the CMS detector response, based on geant 4 [30], for signal samples the detector simulation is performed using the CMS fast simulation package [31]. Detailed cross checks are conducted to ensure that the results obtained with fast simulation are in agreement with the ones obtained with geant-based detector simulation. For SM backgrounds, the most accurate calculations of the cross sections available in the literature are used [32,33]. These are usually at next-to-leading order (NLO) in \u03b1 S . For the SUSY signal samples, cross sections are calculated at NLO [34][35][36][37][38] using the Prospino 2.1 [39] program.",

            "text": "The data and simulated events are reconstructed and analyzed in an identical manner. The event reconstruction is based on the particle-flow (PF) algorithm [40,41], which reconstructs and identifies charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, photons, muons, and electrons. Electrons and muons are required to have transverse momentum p T > 10 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.4. For electrons, the transition region between barrel and endcaps (1.442 < |\u03b7| < 1.566) is excluded because the electron reconstruction in this region is not optimal. An isolation requirement is also employed, requiring that the p T sum of photons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons, in a cone of \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.3 along the lepton direction, divided by the lepton p T value, be less than 0.15 for electrons and JHEP05 (2015)0780.20 for muons. The isolation value is corrected for the effects of pileup, that is, multiple pp collisions within the same bunch crossing as the primary interaction. The electron and muon reconstruction and identification criteria are described in refs. [42] and [43], respectively. All particles, except the isolated electrons and muons, are clustered into PF jets [44] using the anti-k T jet-clustering algorithm [45] with a size parameter of 0.5. The jet energy is calibrated by applying correction factors as a function of the p T and the \u03b7 of the jet [44]. The effect of pileup on jet energies is treated as follows: tracks not associated with the primary interaction are removed from the jet; for the neutral part of the jet, the effect of pileup is reduced using the FastJet pileup subtraction procedure [46,47]. All jets are required to satisfy basic quality criteria (jet ID [48]), which eliminate, for example, spurious events due to calorimeter noise. Jets are also required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets are b-tagged using the medium working point of the combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm [49]. Tau leptons are reconstructed in their decays to one or three charged particles [50] and are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3. The \u03c4 leptons are also required to satisfy a loose isolation selection: the p T -sum of charged hadrons and photons that appear within \u2206R < 0.5 of the candidate \u03c4 -lepton direction is required to be less than 2 GeV after subtraction of the pileup contribution. Throughout this paper, any mention of a \u03c4 lepton refers to its reconstructed hadronic decay. Photons [51] are required to have p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, and to not appear in the transition region between the barrel and endcap detectors. Photons are further required to satisfy selection criteria based on the shape of their calorimetric shower, to deposit little energy in the hadron calorimeter, and to fulfill isolation requirements.",

These regions are chosen after testing the sensitivity of the search to various SUSY SMS models using simulated data. The regions with N b = 0 are the most sensitive to the production of gluinos that do not decay to top and bottom quarks, and to the production of squarks of the first two generations. The regions with N b > 0 and low (high) values of N j are designed for bottom-and top-squark production with decays to bottom (top) quarks. Finally, the signal regions with N j \u2265 3 and N b \u2265 3 provide extra sensitivity to final states with multiple bottom or top quarks, for example from gluino pair-production. Since the values of M T2 and H T in a SUSY event depend strongly on the mass of the initially produced SUSY particles, a wide range of values in M T2 and H T is considered. Each of the nine topological regions is divided into three sub-regions of H T , as shown in figure 1 (right): the low-H T region 450 < H T \u2264 750 GeV, the medium-H T region 750 < H T \u2264 1200 GeV, and the high-H T region H T > 1200 GeV. Each of these regions is examined in bins of M T2 , where the number of bins (up to nine) depends on the specific topological and H T selection. By design, the lowest bin in M T2 is chosen such that the multijet background is expected to be less than \u223c1-10% of the total background. The minimum threshold on M T2 varies between 100 and 200 GeV, depending on the topological region and the H T requirement. The edges of the M T2 bins are adjusted to ensure that there are a sufficient number of events in each bin of the corresponding control samples for the background evaluation (section 6). The definitions of all signal regions are specified in table 1. Figure 2 shows the M T2 distributions in simulation and data for the low-, medium-, and high-H T selections, inclusively in all signal regions of the N j -N b plane. For M T2 < 80 GeV the distribution in the medium-and high-H T regions is completely dominated by multijet events. For this reason, these bins are used only as control regions.",

Including the statistical uncertainties from the data control regions, the total uncertainty of the lost-lepton background ranges from 10 to 65%. The uncertainty in the shape of the M T2 distribution is estimated by varying parameters in the simulation. The most important of these uncertainties are the recoil modelling [52] (20%), the matching scale, the renormalization and factorization scales (10-20%), and the jet energy scale [44] (10%).

For vector boson p T m Z , however, the ratio of cross sections for prompt-photon to Z-boson production is determined by the ratio of the couplings of the respective boson to quarks, and thus approaches a constant value. In this range of the boson p T , the distributions of H T and other kinematic observables are very similar for the Z+jets and \u03b3+jets processes. The \u03b3+jets process, with its relatively large event yield, is thus well suited to provide an estimate of the Z (\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background. Figure 5 shows a comparison between data and simulation for the M T2 distribution in \u03b3+jets control samples, for which N b =0 is required. The photon p T is added to p miss T vector and all event variables are recalculated. To reduce the potential contribution of signal events to these control samples, we require the reconstructed E miss T to be less than 100 GeV prior to including the reconstructed photon momentum. For the low-H T signal regions, the \u03b3+jets events are selected with a single-photon trigger, which requires the photon p T to exceed 150 GeV. The single-photon trigger is used because the triggers discussed in section 3 are unable to select events with low enough E miss T . For the mediumand high-H T signal regions, the triggers discussed in section 3 are used.",

The shower shape variable that we use is \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 , which is a measure of the lateral extent in \u03b7 of the photon energy cluster in the calorimeter [51]. The fit is performed separately in the electromagnetic calorimeter barrel and endcap detectors, for events with N b = 0 and with no requirement on M T2 . This sample of events is dominated by -13 -JHEP05(2015)078 low-p T photons, for which the shower shape variable provides high discrimination between prompt photons and photons from neutral-meson decays. Starting from the overall promptphoton fraction observed in data, we use simulation to extrapolate the contributions of the two types of photon events in M T2 . For each signal region with N b = 0, the final Z (\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background estimate is obtained from the number of prompt-photon events, rescaled by the M T2 -dependent ratio of Z (\u03bd\u03bd)+jets to \u03b3+jets events from simulation.

The first is an inclusive search based on several signal regions defined by the number of jets and b-tagged jets, the hadronic energy in the event, and the value of the M T2 variable. The second is a search for events that contain a Higgs boson in the decay chain of a heavy SUSY particle. Assuming that this boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair in accordance with the branching fraction of the standard model Higgs boson, this category of events has been investigated to seek an excess at 125 GeV in the invariant mass distribution of the selected b-tagged jet pairs.  No significant excess over the expected number of background events has been observed, and 95% confidence level exclusion limits on several SUSY simplified models and on the cMSSM/mSUGRA model have been derived. Mass limits have been conservatively derived using the theoretical signal cross sections reduced by one times their uncertainty (\u22121\u03c3 theory ). In the context of simplified models based on pair-produced gluinos, each decaying into a quark-antiquark pair and a lightest SUSY particle (LSP) via an off-shell squark, gluino masses have been probed up to 1225-1300 GeV depending on the squark flavour. For the direct pair production of the first-and second-generation squarks, each assumed to decay to a quark of the same flavour and a light LSP, masses below 875 GeV have been probed JHEP05(2015)078  under the assumption of eight degenerate light squarks. If only a single squark is assumed to be light, this limit decreases to 520 GeV. For the direct production of third-generation squark pairs, each assumed to decay to a quark of the same flavour and a light LSP, masses up to 640 GeV for bottom squarks and 450 GeV for top squarks have been probed. In the cMSSM/mSUGRA scenario corresponding to tan \u03b2 = 30, A 0 = \u22122 max(m 0 , m 1/2 ), and \u00b5 > 0, absolute mass limits have been found to be: m q > 1450 GeV, m g > 1150 GeV, and m q = m g > 1550 GeV when equal squark and gluino masses are assumed.",
