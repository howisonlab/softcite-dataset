SQM consists of aggregates of u, d and s quarks (in approximately equal proportions) with slightly positive electric charge [5]. It was suggested that SQM may be the ground state of QCD. They should be stable for all baryon numbers in the range between ordinary heavy nuclei and neutron stars (A \u223c 10 57 ). Nuclearite interaction with matter depend on their mass and size. In ref. [6] different mechanisms of energy loss and propagation in relation to their detectability with the SLIM apparatus are considered. In the absence of any candidate, SLIM will be able to rule out some of the hypothesized propagation mechanisms.",

Since MMs, nuclearites and Q-balls should have a constant REL through the stack, the signal looked for is a hole or a biconical track with the two base-cone areas equal within the experimental uncertainties. The sheets are scanned with a low magnification stereo microscope. Possible candidates are further analyzed with a high magnification microscope. The size of surface tracks is measured on both sides of the sheet. We require the two values to be equal within 3 times the standard deviation of their difference. A track is defined as a \"candidate\" if the REL and the incidence angles on the front and back sides are equal to within 15%. To confirm the candidate track, the bottom CR39 layer is then etched in soft conditions; an accurate scan under an optical microscope with high magnification is performed in a region of about 0.5 mm around the expected candidate position. If a two-fold coincidence is found the middle layer of the CR39 (and in case of high Z candidate, the Makrofol layer) is analyzed with soft conditions. ",

We etched \"softly\" all the sheets in order to be able to follow the evolution of the etch-pits. A second event was found in the CR39 bottom layer (top face) of module 7410, see Fig. 2right. Some background tracks in other modules were found after 30 h of soft etching. We decided to further etch \"strongly\" the 7410-L6 layer in short time steps (5h) and to follow the evolution of the \"tracks\" by systematically making photographs at each etching step. After additional strong etching, the \"tracks\" began more and more similar to those in the 7408-L1 layer, see Fig.  2right(b,c,d). The presence of this second event/background and its evolution with increasing etching casts stronger doubts on the event interpretation and supports a \"background\" interpretation also of the \"tracks\" in module 7408. We made different hypotheses and we checked them with the Intercast Co. Since 1980 we analyzed more than 1000 m 2 of CR39 using different etching conditions and we have not seen before any of the above mentioned cases.
