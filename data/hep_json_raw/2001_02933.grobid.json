The procedure relies on applying theoretical acceptance corrections computed as a function of the transverse momentum of the W/Z boson, p T , to the experimental measurement, rather than comparing data directly against fiducial fixed-order predictions. It is demonstrated that, contrary to standard fiducial computations, these acceptance factors vary little at low p T , so they can be reliably computed using fixed-order perturbation theory. An example analysis is performed using the ATLAS measurement of the Z -boson production cross section at center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The resulting full phase space measurement of the cross section differential in the boson rapidity is compared to theoretical predictions computed with next-to-nextto leading-order accuracy in QCD. Further extensions of the approach which include different types of measurements and improved theoretical predictions are discussed.",

For these observables, the corresponding computations are inclusive in the boson transverse momentum p T and thus insensitive to ln p T /m divergences, providing a robust input for determination of collinear PDFs. However the ATLAS measurement is performed in a fiducial volume with experimental cuts on the lepton transverse momentum and lepton pseudorapidity which are required due to the detector acceptance. These selection criteria introduce dependence on p T modelling thereby spoiling accuracy of the fixed-order predictions. The study performed in Ref. [3] shows that predictions become unstable with respect to small variations of the cuts. In addition, calculations obtained using various public NNLO codes differ as much as 1% which is significant compared to the experimental accuracy.",

            "text": "The impact of the fiducial cuts on fixed-order predictions is under investigation since some time. It is known to be large when transverse momentum of individual leptons (or jets) approaches half of the invariant mass of the lepton pair (or jet pair). It has been proposed in Ref. [9] to introduce an asymmetry for the cut values for the leading and sub-leading objects. This procedure seems to stabilize the computation of the fixed-order predictions with respect to small variation of experimental cuts, however a closer analysis shows that it does not eliminate the uncertainty arising from the logarithmic corrections which remains similar to the symmetric cuts cases [10]. Computation of higher order corrections and/or inclusion of the ln p T /m resummation should reduce the uncertainty arising from the fiducial cuts. However the full next-to-next-to-next-to leading-order (N 3 LO) corrections for Drell-Yan processes are not available yet, while resummation corrections may bring additional uncertainties from the recoil prescription [11]. Experimentally, it is sometimes possible to isolate regions in the phase space which are not affected by fiducial cuts. For example, in Ref. [12] the fiducial acceptance for the triple differential measurement of d\u03c3 dy d cos \u03b8dm , where cos \u03b8 is the lepton polar angular variable, is above 99% for | cos \u03b8 | < 0.4, y < 1 and m > 66 GeV [13]. This region can be safely compared to fixed-order predictions. Other experimental methods include explicit correction to the full phase space during the data analysis, as in e.g. Ref. [14].",

            "text": "In this paper, another approach is proposed. It is based on an observation that an acceptance correction from the fiducial to full phase space has moderate dependence on p T , including low p T region, as discussed in Sect. 2, so that it can be determined using fixed-order calculations. This is demonstrated in Sect. 3 using the ATLAS measurement of Z -boson production differential in y and p T performed using data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [15]. The acceptance correction is computed at NLO for the Z plus jet process (O(\u03b1 2 S ), where \u03b1 S is the strong coupling constant), using the MCFM v6.8 program [16], interfaced to APPLGRID [17]. In Sect. 4, the correction is used to determine the full phase space measurement differential in y and p T . The result is integrated in p T and the inclusive d\u03c3/dy differential cross-section measurement is compared to the NNLO (O(\u03b1 2 S )) computation for inclusive Z -boson production obtained using the MCFM v9 program [18,19]. To illustrate the importance of the acceptance effects, another comparison is performed in which the fiducial data are integrated in p T directly and compared to the fiducial predictions computed to the same order. While these two comparisons are performed at the same accuracy of the fixed order predictions in O(\u03b1 2 S ), a visible difference is observed with the approach advocated in this paper giving a better overall description of the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, possible applications of the method to other measurements, and possible further studies of theoretical predictions.",

The harmonic polynomials depend on eight angular coefficients A i ( p T , y , m ) which define fractions of helicity cross sections with respect to the unpolarised case. Equation 3 relies on factorization of the Z boson production and decay processes. In essence, it represents production of a spin one particle and its following decay. It is violated by electroweak corrections which contain interaction of the initial quarks and final state leptons. It is also modified for the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 scattering process. These corrections are small at the Z -pole region and neglected in the following, however it is possible to extend the proposed procedure and include them. For the measurements insensitive to the azimuthal angle \u03c6 and forward-backward asymmetry in cos \u03b8 , the most important coefficient is A 0 . This is the case for all fiducial measurements of Z -boson production at the LHC, which use charge-symmetric cuts on lepton rapidities. The coefficient A 0 vanishes for p T \u2192 0 and saturates at A 0 = 1 for p T 100 GeV. To understand better the p T dependence of the angular coefficients A i , and of the most important coefficient A 0 in particular, it is useful to follow the geometrical approach of Refs. [21,22]. For the coordinate system in which the zaxis is aligned with the momentum direction of the qq pair producing the Z boson, A 0 = 0, as follows from helicity conservation arguments. The direction of the z-axis in this coordinate system depends on radiation and in general does not agree with the z-axis of the fixed physical rest frame, such as given by the direction of the incoming hadrons (laboratory frame). Defining \u03b8 1 as the angle between the two axes, it can be shown based on simple geometrical arguments that A 0 can be calculated as A 0 = sin 2 \u03b8 1 where the average is taken over all event configurations.

It is possible that the A 2 coefficient is sensitive to non-perturbative effects at low p T [23], however this should have a small impact on the acceptance. It was demonstrated in Ref. [20] which compared predictions for the A i coefficients to the data obtained by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [24,25]. The calculations were performed at LO (O(\u03b1 S )), NLO (O(\u03b1 2 S )) and NNLO (O(\u03b1 3 S )) order for the Z -boson plus jet process, as provided by the NNLOJET program [26]. For the coefficient A 0 , good perturbative convergence is observed with already LO predictions being in excellent agreement with the data as shown in Ref. [25] for p T down to 2.5 GeV. 1 Given the p T , y , m values and the A i coefficients, the kinematics of the final state leptons and thereby the fraction of events passing fiducial cuts is fully determined. Any fixedorder prediction for the Z boson plus jet process must obey decomposition of Eq. 3. Therefore, the fiducial acceptance for each p T , y , m bin can be determined at fixed order, provided it is narrow enough to neglect the p T dependence inside the bin. The residual theoretical uncertainties arising in this procedure can be estimated the usual way, by PDF and scale variations.",

The p T dependence of the acceptance is also different for forward compared to central rapidities. The first bin in p T spans between 0 and 2 GeV and NLO calculations of the acceptance become unstable, thus only the LO result is presented. For all other bins, LO and NLO calculations agree very well. Figure 2 presents quantitative comparison of the acceptances computed at different orders in terms of \u03b4 = A NLO /A LO \u2212 1. The NLO correction is below 0.1% for p T < m Z for all rapidity bins with y < 2.0. For all bins the correction does not exceed 1%, indicating good convergence of the perturbative series.

The scale uncertainties are estimated by varying factorization and renormalization scale by factor of two and taking the envelope of resulting acceptance factors. Both PDF and scale uncertainties evaluated this way are typically below 0.1%. The PDF uncertainties increase to about 0.15% for the highest rapidity bin. As an additional check of the PDF dependence, the acceptance is calculated using CT14NNLO, MMHT14NNLO [33], NNPDF31 [34], ABMP16 [35] and ATLASepWZ16 [3] PDF sets. For all sets except ATLASepWZ16, the calculated acceptance is found to be within the PDF error bands of the CT18ANNLO set. The ATLASepWZ16 based acceptance agrees with the other sets for y < 2. For the highest rapidity bin, the acceptance based on ATLASepwz16 deviates by as much as \u22120.2% for low p T and up to +0.35% for p T around m Z . No additional uncertainty is introduced due to this deviation. The smallness of the uncertainties is related to the fact that the main effect is purely kinematic variation of the fiducial acceptance as a function of p T and theoretical uncertainties arise only from modeling of the polarisation. To gain some insight on polarisation uncertainties, one can again follow the intuitive geometrical approach of Refs. [21,22]. For the predictions at LO, the contributions from qq and qg subprocesses lead to different average mis-alignment angle \u03b8 1 yielding in different A 0 . It is shown in Refs. [21,22] that the polarisation coefficients observed in data do indeed lie between the two predictions. APPLGRID based calculations allow to separate contributions of qq and qg subprocesses, fiducial acceptances for which can be compared to the full result. The resulting comparison is shown in Fig. 4 for |y| < 0.4. Scale variations yield only to small changes of the acceptances of the individual contributions, and a common scale variation for both of them yields to a moderate change in their relative size. This may explain the smallness of the acceptance uncertainty due to the scale variation seen in Fig. 3. It is possible that higher order corrections may have different impact on qq and qg subprocesses, and to be conservative the scale variations are considered as independent for them with the total scale uncertainty evaluated as a sum in quadrature. The resulting uncertainty is shown in Fig. 5 is always larger compared to the standard approach shown in Fig. 3.",

For these bin sizes the variation of the fiducial acceptance can be neglected since it is much smaller compared to the data statistical uncertainty for the corresponding enclosing analysis bins.

It is also interesting to compare the ratios of the full cross sections to the ratios of the fiducial cross sections, to see the impact of the p Tdependent acceptance corrections. The fiducial cross section in data is computed by simple integration over the differential cross section. It is verified that the total fiducial cross section agrees with the one reported in the ATLAS publication. The NNLO predictions are obtained using the MCFM v9 program with fiducial cuts enabled. The resulting full and fiducial cross-section ratios for the two PDF sets are shown in Fig. 9. For the CT14NNLO based prediction, the ratio of the full phase space cross sections is closer to the unity compared to the ratio of the fiducial cross sections. The dependence of the ratio on y is also reduced significantly. For the ATLASepWZ16 based prediction, the fiducial ratio is closer to unity, which is not too surprising since the set is fitted to the fiducial ATLAS measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The difference between full and fiducial ratios is similar for both predictions for the five y < 2.0 bins. For the first three bins the fiducial ratio is lower than the full one, by as much as 2%, for the two lowest y bins. For bins with 1.2 < y < 2.0, they roughly agree. For the highest rapidity bin, the behavior is different depending on the PDF set.

Given that the strange-quark distribution affects low rapidity region more, based on this observation, it is possible to make a conjecture that the ATLAS data may prefer somewhat larger strangeness content than in the CT14NNLO set and somewhat smaller than in the ATLASepWZ16 set. The overshoot of the predictions based on the ATLASepWZ16 set is likely to be caused by the bias in the fiducial NNLO prediction which was used in the analysis of the ATLAS data at \u221a s = 7 TeV. To check this, predictions based on CT18NNLO, CT18ANNLO and CT18ZNNLO PDF sets [31,32] are compared to the data in the full phase space. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Compared to the CT18NNLO set, both CT18ANNLO and CT18ZNNLO sets include the ATLAS W, Z data at \u221a s = 7 TeV. As a result, the CT18ANNLO and CT18ZNNLO sets have an enhanced strange-quark distribution, with no suppression compared to other light quarks for Bjorken x < 0.01. The enhancement is however smaller compared to the ATLASepWZ16 set since the CT18 sets use other data which favor smaller strangeness. The strangequark distribution in CT18NNLO is similar to CT14NNLO. The CT18ANNLO set in addition uses a charm-quark mass that is increased compared to other PDF sets. This leads to suppression of the charm-quark contribution, compensated by an increase of the light-quark sea, yielding in turn an increase of the Drell-Yan cross sections at the LHC, as it was demonstrated in Ref. [37]. The predictions based on the CT18ANNLO and CT18ZNNLO sets show better agreement with the ATLAS data compared to those based on the CT18NNLO set: the ratio shows no dependence on y and the overall normalisation of the ratio is closer to unity.",

The method requires the data to be measured differentially in the boson transverse momentum p T in addition to other variables of interest such as y and m . It relies on the ability to calculate the fiducial acceptance cor-rection for a given p T value at fixed order. The method should be extended in future by inclusion of electroweak corrections and estimation of resummation effects.",
