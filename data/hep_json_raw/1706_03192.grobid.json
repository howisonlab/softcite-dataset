The total integrated luminosity of the analysed data set amounts to 20.2 fb \u22121 . Double-differential cross-sections are measured for jets defined by the anti-k t jet clustering algorithm with radius parameters of R = 0.4 and R = 0.6 and are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum, in the range between 70 GeV and 2.5 TeV and in six bins of the absolute jet rapidity, between 0 and 3.0. The measured cross-sections are compared to predictions of quantum chromodynamics, calculated at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, and corrected for non-perturbative and electroweak effects. The level of agreement with predictions, using a selection of different parton distribution functions for the proton, is quantified. Tensions between the data and the theory predictions are observed.",

The inclusive jet production cross-section (p + p \u2192 jet + X) gives valuable information about the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 s ) and the structure of the proton.

At the LHC, the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured inclusive jet cross-sections in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 2. 76  . This paper presents the measurement of the inclusive jet cross-sections in protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV using data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 .

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t jet clustering algorithm [26] with radius parameters of R = 0.4 and R = 0.6. The measurement is performed for two jet radius parameters, since the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions are different.

The jet energy is corrected for the effect of multiple proton-proton interactions (pile-up) both in collision data and in simulated events. Further corrections depending on the jet energy and the jet pseudorapidity (\u03b7) are applied to achieve a calibration that matches the energy of jets composed of stable particles in simulated events. Fluctuations in the particle content of jets and in hadronic calorimeter showers are reduced with the help of observables characterising internal jet properties. These corrections are applied sequentially (Global Sequential Calibration). Differences between data and Monte Carlo simulation are evaluated using insitu techniques exploiting the p T balance of a jet and a well-measured object such as a photon (\u03b3+jet balance), a Z boson (Z+jet balance) or a system of jets (multijet balance). These processes are used to calibrate the jet energy in the central detector region, while the p T balance in dijet events is used to achieve an intercalibration of jets in the forward region with respect to central jets (dijet balance).",

The PDF uncertainty is defined at 68% confidence level (CL) and is evaluated following the prescriptions given for each PDF set, as recommended by the PDF4LHC group for PDF-sensitive analyses [71]. The scale uncertainty is evaluated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two with respect to the original choice in the calculation. The envelope of the cross-sections with all possible combinations of the scale variations, except the ones when the two scales are varied in opposite directions, is considered as a systematic uncertainty. An alternative scale choice, \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F = p jet T , the p T of each individual jet that enters the cross-section calculation, is also considered. This scale choice is proposed in ref. [72]. The difference with respect to the prediction obtained for the p jet,max T scale choice is treated as an additional uncertainty. The uncertainty from \u03b1 s is evaluated by calculating the cross-sections using two PDF sets determined with two different values of \u03b1 s and then scaling the cross-section difference corresponding to an \u03b1 s uncertainty \u2206\u03b1 s = 0.0015 as recommended in ref.

The renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in most phase-space regions, rising from around 5\u221210% at low p T in the central rapidity bin to about 50% in the highest p T bins in the most forward rapidity region. This uncertainty is asymmetric and it is larger for anti-k t jets with R = 0.6 than for jets with R = 0.4. The alternative scale choice, p jet T , leads to a similar inclusive jet cross-section at the highest jet p T , but gives an increasingly higher cross-section when the jet p T decreases. For p T = 70 GeV this difference is about 10%. The PDF uncertainties vary from 5% to 50% depending on the jet p T and rapidity. The \u03b1 s uncertainty is about 3% and is rather constant in the considered phase-space regions.",

Setting the scale to p jet T instead of p jet,max T (see section 9.1) leads to an NLO QCD prediction that is at low jet p T higher than the prediction using the p jet,max T scale (about 8% at p T = 100 GeV for all pseudorapidity regions). With this scale setting the deviation from the data at low p T is larger. The recent calculation of NNLO QCD inclusive jet cross-sections at \u221a s = 7 TeV is higher than in NLO QCD at low jet p T for all jet rapidity regions [12]. For instance, for p T = 100 GeV the increase from NLO to NNLO is about 10%. For both the NNLO and the NLO QCD calculations the p jet,max T scale is used. Therefore, it is expected that the NNLO QCD prediction at \u221a s = 8 TeV would deviate from the data more strongly than the NLO QCD calculation. This deviation might need to be accommodated by an adjustment of the PDFs.",

            "text": "[56] for more details). However, even if the exact correlations are not known, one must keep in mind that this potential \u03c7 2 reduction is far too optimistic, since some non-negligible level of correlation, in both p T and |y|, is expected for these uncertainties. This motivated some tests using more realistic decorrelation models for these uncertainties. These experimental systematic uncertainties are split into sub-components whose size varies with jet rapidity and p T . While the sub-components are independent of each other, each of them is fully correlated between different phase-space regions and their sum in quadrature equals the original uncertainty. A series of 18 different splitting options into two or three sub-components, with various smooth p T and |y| dependences, were studied for both R = 0.4 and R = 0.6, using the CT14 PDF set and the -24 -JHEP09(2017)020 p jet,max T scale choice. While many of these decorrelation options have little impact on the \u03c7 2 , some of them induce a \u03c7 2 reduction by up to 33 units. When applying various splitting options (the ones yielding the largest \u03c7 2 reductions when splitting one single component) to the JES Flavour Response, JES MJB Fragmentation and JES Pile-up Rho topology uncertainties simultaneously, the \u03c7 2 is reduced by up to 51 units compared to the nominal JES configuration. For all these variations of the correlations, the corresponding P obs values are 10 \u22123 . For the theoretical uncertainties, in addition to the 18 options discussed above, 3 other splitting options based on the ones discussed in ref. [88] were tested. These additional options consist in splitting a given uncertainty component into six sub-components. Many of these decorrelation options have little impact on the \u03c7 2 , but some of them induce a \u03c7 2 reduction by up to 60 units. Still, all the corresponding P obs values are 10 \u22123 . When applying various splitting options (the ones yielding the largest \u03c7 2 reductions when splitting one single component) to the scale variations, the alternative scale choice and the non-perturbative corrections uncertainties simultaneously, the \u03c7 2 is reduced by up to 87 units compared to the nominal configuration, but the corresponding P obs values are still 10 \u22123 . The various splitting options yielding the largest \u03c7 2 reductions when splitting either the experimental or the theoretical uncertainties were applied to both the experimental (JES Flavour Response, the JES MJB Fragmentation, JES Pile-up Rho topology) and theoretical uncertainties (the scale variations, the alternative scale choice and the non-perturbative corrections uncertainties) simultaneously. In this case the \u03c7 2 evaluated for CT14 is reduced by up to 96 units compared to the nominal configuration, but the corresponding P obs values are still below 10 \u22123 . Similar reductions of the \u03c7 2 values are observed for NNPDF3.0.",

The same is true when using similar decorrelation scenarios for the theoretical uncertainties. When decorrelating the JES uncertainty components and the theoretical uncertainties simultaneously, values of \u03c7 2 /ndf down to 256/159 are obtained. Furthermore, it should be noted that for the experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties that are based on simple comparisons between two options (e.g. the renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties), even the notion of a standard deviation (i.e. the size of the uncertainty itself) in different phase-space regions is not well defined. Since, in addition to the correlations, the phasespace dependence of the size of the uncertainties is a key ingredient in the \u03c7 2 evaluation, this second aspect may also explain part of the observed tension between the measurement and the theory.

Strong tension between data and JHEP09(2017)020 theory is observed when considering data points from all jet transverse momentum and rapidity regions, with a full treatment of the correlations. This tension can be reduced, but not completely resolved, using alternative correlation scenarios for the experimental and theoretical two-point systematic uncertainties.
