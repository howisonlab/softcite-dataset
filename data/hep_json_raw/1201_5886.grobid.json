            "text": "Discovering the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass for elementary particles is one of the primary goals of the physics program of the ATLAS experiment [1]. In the Standard Model (SM), this mechanism requires the existence of a scalar particle, the Higgs boson [2], which couples both to bosons and fermions. In several fermiophobic extensions of SM [3] the Higgs field couplings to some or all fermion generations are strongly suppressed or absent, altering the expected Higgs boson production and decay characteristics. For the minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model (MSSM) [4] two Higgs doublets of opposite hypercharge are required, resulting in five observable Higgs bosons. Three of these Higgs bosons (the CP even h, H, and the CP odd A) are electrically neutral, while two are charged (H \u00b1 ). Further, the left-right symmetric models [5], the Higgs triplet models [6] and the little Higgs models [7] predict existence of doubly charged Higgs bosons. In this paper, we report ATLAS results of searches for Higgs bosons in scenarios beyond the Standard Model.",

The analysis follows the ATLAS Standard Model H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 search [8], asking for two energetic photons with transverse momenta p T greater than 40 and 25 GeV, respectively. Then the diphoton invariant mass is analysed in three ranges of the transverse momentum of the photon pair.

            "text": "In the MSSM, the strength of the effective Higgs boson couplings to fermions and gauge bosons is different from those in the Standard Model. The Higgs boson production proceeds mainly via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks, where the latter is enhanced by tan 2 \u03b2 and thus becomes more important for large values of tan \u03b2. While decays to ZZ or WW are dominant in the Standard Model for Higgs boson masses above 140 GeV, in the MSSM these decay modes are either suppressed by cos 2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), where \u03b1 is the mixing angle of the two CP-even Higgs bosons, for the H boson or even absent for the A boson. For h boson the coupling is reduced by sin 2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1). In particular, the couplings of the Higgs bosons to the third generation downtype fermions is strongly enhanced for large region of the MSSM parameters space. Hence the decays of the neutral Higgs bosons into a pair of tau leptons and decays of the charged Higgs boson to tau lepton and tau neutrino are ones of the most promising channels. The difficult part is the reconstruction of the tau lepton decay products, which have lower p T due to escaping neutrinos and suppression of the jet background to hadronic tau decays (\u03c4 h ). In case of leptonic tau decays, the electrons and muons from tau typically have lower momenta than prompt leptons, and therefore are difficult to trigger.",

The dominant top quark and W+jet backgrounds are estimated using event topology similar to the signal, but with muon instead of the tau in the final state. The reconstructed muon is then replaced by simulated tau decaying hadronically, where tau momentum set equal to the reconstructed muon momentum. The multi-jet background is estimated using control region by reverting tau identification and b-tagging requirements. In two latter cases, the signal is searched for using the invariant mass of b-quark and electron or muon coming from the same top-quark and a Higgs boson candidate transverse mass by performing maximization of the invariant mass over possible values for neutrino momenta in each event [15].

            "text": "Doubly charged Higgs bosons are predicted by a number of models such as left-right symmetric models [5], Higgs triplet [6] or little Higgs models [7]. The dominant production process of doubly charged Higgs boson is a pair production via the Drell-Yann process pp \u2192 H ++ H \u2212\u2212 . The search is performed in events with two muons with the same charge using 1.6 fb \u22121 [17]. Only coupling values between 10 \u22125 and 0.5 of the H \u00b1\u00b1 to muons are considered to ensure a short lifetime (c\u03c4 < 10\u00b5m) and to ensure that the relative natural width of the Higgs boson is less than 1%. The data are in good agreement with the background prediction. The backgrounds at low masses are populated by non-prompt muons, originating in heavy flavor decay or decay-in-flight of pions or kaons. The high mass range has an additional contribution from di-boson production. No evidence for any resonant production of like-sign dimuon pairs is observed. Stringent limits are placed on H \u00b1\u00b1 masses between 295 GeV (375 GeV) for the right-handed (left-handed) production assuming Br(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 ) = 1, see Fig. 9. The details on cross-section calculations could be found in [17]. Assuming branching ratio of 33% the corresponding limits become 210 (268) GeV, respectively.",
