            "text": "The rare decays B 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 and B 0 ! \u00fe \u00c0 are highly suppressed and their branching fractions precisely predicted in the standard model (SM); any observed deviation would therefore be a clear sign of physics beyond the SM, for example a nonstandard Higgs sector. The SM predicts branching fractions of B\u00f0B 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f03:35 AE 0:28\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c09 and B\u00f0B 0 ! \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f01:07 AE 0:10\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c010 . These theoretical predictions are for decays at decay time t \u00bc 0, and have been updated with respect to Refs. [1,2] using the latest average for the B 0 s meson lifetime, B 0 s \u00bc 1:516 AE 0:011 ps [3]. The uncertainty is dominated by the precision of lattice QCD calculations of the decay constants [1,[4][5][6][7]. In the B 0 s system, due to the finite width difference, the comparison between the above prediction and the measured time-integrated branching fraction requires a model-dependent correction [8]. The SM time-integrated prediction is therefore B\u00f0B 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f03:56 AE 0:30\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c09 , using the relative decay width difference \u00c1\u00c0 s =\u00f02\u00c0 s \u00de \u00bc 0:0615 AE 0:0085 [3].",

            "text": "The first search for dimuon decays of B mesons took place 30 years ago [9]. Since then, possible deviations from the SM prediction have been constrained by various searches, with the most recent results available in Refs. [10][11][12][13][14]. The first evidence for the B 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay was reported by LHCb in Ref. [12], with B\u00f0B 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f03:2 \u00fe1:5 \u00c01:2 \u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c09 , together with the lowest limit on the B 0 decay, B\u00f0B 0 ! \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de < 9:4 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 at 95% confidence level (C.L.). The results presented in this Letter improve on and supersede our previous measurements [12]. They are based on data collected with the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb \u00c01 of pp collisions at the LHC recorded in 2011 at a center-of-mass energy ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7TeV, and 2 fb \u00c01 recorded in 2012 at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV. These data include an additional 1 fb \u00c01 compared to the sample analyzed in Ref. [12], and have been reconstructed with improved algorithms and detector alignment parameters leading to slightly higher signal reconstruction efficiency and better invariant mass resolution. The samples from the two center-of-mass energies are analyzed as a combined data set. The analysis strategy is very similar to that employed in Ref. [12], with a different multivariate operator based on a boosted decision trees algorithm (BDT) [15,16]. After trigger and loose selection requirements, B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 candidates are classified according to dimuon invariant mass and BDT output. The distribution of candidates is compared with the background estimates to determine the signal yield and significance. The signal yield is converted into a branching fraction using a relative normalization to the channels B 0 ! K \u00fe \u00c0 and B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe with J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 . Inclusion of charge-conjugated processes is implied throughout this Letter. To avoid potential biases, candidates in the signal regions were not examined until the analysis procedure had been finalized.",

The B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 candidates are predominantly selected by single-muon and dimuon triggers. Candidate B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe decays are selected in a similar way, the only difference being a different dimuon mass requirement in the software trigger. Candidate B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! h \u00fe h 0\u00c0 decays (where h \u00f00\u00de \u00bc , K), used as control channels, are required to be triggered independently of the B 0 \u00f0s\u00de decay products. Candidate B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 decays are selected by combining two oppositely charged tracks with high quality muon identification [25], transverse momentum p T satisfying 0:25 < p T < 40 GeV=c, and momentum p < 500 GeV=c. The two tracks are required to form a secondary vertex (SV), with 2 per degree of freedom less than 9, displaced from any pp interaction vertex (primary vertex, PV) by a flight distance significance greater than 15. The smallest impact parameter 2 ( 2 IP ), defined as the difference between the 2 of a PV formed with and without the track in question, is required to be larger than 25 with respect to any PV for the muon candidates. Only B candidates with p T > 0:5 GeV=c, decay time less than 9 \u00c2 B 0 s [3], impact parameter significance IP=\u00f0IP\u00de < 5 with respect to the PV for which the B IP is minimal, and dimuon invariant mass in the range \u00bd4900; 6000 MeV=c 2 are selected. The control and normalization channels are selected with almost identical requirements to those applied to the signal sample. The B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! h \u00fe h 0\u00c0 selection is the same as that of B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 , except that muon identification criteria are not applied. The B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe decay is reconstructed from a dimuon pair combined to form the J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay and selected in the same way as the B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 signal samples, except for the requirements on the impact parameter significance and mass. After a requirement of 2 IP > 25, kaon candidates are combined with the J=c candidates. These selection criteria are completed by a requirement on the response of a multivariate operator, called MVS in Ref. [26] and unchanged since then, applied to candidates in both signal and normalization channels. After the trigger and selection requirements are applied, 55 661 signal dimuon candidates are found, which are used for the search.",

The BDT combines information from the following input variables: the B candidate decay time, IP and p T ; the minimum 2 IP of the two muons with respect to any PV; the distance of closest approach between the two muons; and the cosine of the angle between the muon momentum in the dimuon rest frame and the vector perpendicular to both the B candidate momentum and the beam axis. Moreover, two different measures for the isolation of signal candidates are also included: the number of good two-track vertices a muon can make with other tracks in the event; and the B candidate isolation, introduced in Ref. [27]. With respect to the multivariate operator used in previous analyses [12,26], the minimum p T of the two muons is no longer used while four new variables are included to improve the separation power. The first two are the absolute values of the differences between the pseudorapidities of the two muon candidates and between their azimuthal angles. The others are the angle of the momentum of the B candidate in the laboratory frame, and the angle of the positive muon from the B candidate in the rest frame of the B candidate, both with respect to the sum of the momenta of tracks, in the rest frame of the B candidate, consistent with originating from the decay of a b hadron produced in association to the signal candidate.
