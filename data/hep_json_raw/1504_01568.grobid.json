Using data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, the probability for the \u039b 0 b baryon to decay into the p\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd \u00b5 final state relative to the \u039b + c \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd \u00b5 final state is measured. Combined with theoretical calculations of the strong interaction and a previously measured value of |V cb |, the first |V ub | measurement to use a baryonic decay is performed. This measurement is consistent with previous determinations of |V ub | using B meson decays to specific final states and confirms the existing incompatibility with those using an inclusive sample of final states.",

This matrix arises from the coupling of the quarks to the Higgs boson. Although the SM does not predict the values of the four free parameters of the CKM matrix, the measurements of these parameters in different processes should be consistent with each other. If they are not, it is a sign of physics beyond the SM. In global fits combining all available measurements 3,4 , the sensitivity of the overall consistency check is limited by the precision in the measurements of the magnitude and phase of the matrix element V ub , which describes the transition of a b quark to a u quark.",

            "text": "The magnitude of V ub can be measured via the semileptonic quark-level transition b \u2192 u \u2212 \u03bd . Semileptonic decays are used to minimize the uncertainties arising from the interaction of the strong force, described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), between the final-state quarks. For the measurement of the magnitude of V ub , as opposed to measurements of the phase, all decays of the b quark, and the equivalent b quark, can be considered together. There are two complementary methods to perform the measurement. From an experimental point of view, the simplest is to measure the branching fraction (probability to decay to a given final state) of a specific (exclusive) decay. An example is the decay of a B 0 (bd) meson to the final state \u03c0 + \u2212 \u03bd, where the influence of the strong interaction on the decay, encompassed by a B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + form factor, is predicted by non-perturbative techniques such as lattice QCD (LQCD; ref. 5) or QCD sum rules 6 . The world average from ref. 7 for this method, using the decays B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u2212 \u03bd and B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03bd, is |V ub | = (3.28 \u00b1 0.29) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where the most precise experimental inputs come from the BaBar 8,9 and Belle 10,11 experiments. The uncertainty is dominated by the LQCD calculations, which have recently been updated 12,13 and result in larger values of V ub than the average given in ref. 7. The alternative method is to measure the differential decay rate in an inclusive way over all possible B meson decays containing the b \u2192 u \u2212 \u03bd quark-level transition. This results in |V ub | = (4.41 \u00b1 0.15 +0.15 \u22120.17 ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 (ref. 14), where the first uncertainty arises from the experimental measurement and the second from theoretical calculations. The discrepancy between the exclusive and inclusive |V ub | determinations is approximately three standard deviations and has been a long-standing puzzle in flavour physics. Several explanations have been proposed, such as the presence of a right-handed (vector plus axial-vector) coupling as an extension of the SM beyond the left-handed (vector minus axialvector) W coupling [15][16][17][18] . A similar discrepancy also exists between exclusive and inclusive measurements of |V cb | (the coupling of the b quark to the c quark) 14 .",

This can clearly be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the experimental constraints on the left-handed coupling, |V L ub |, and the fractional right-handed coupling added to the SM, R , for different measurements. The LHCb result presented here is compared to the world averages of the inclusive and exclusive measurements. Unlike the case for the pion in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u2212 \u03bd and B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03bd decays, the spin of the proton is non-zero, allowing an axial-vector current, which gives a different sensitivity to R . The overlap of the bands from the previous measurements suggested a significant righthanded coupling, but the inclusion of the LHCb |V ub | measurement does not support that.",
