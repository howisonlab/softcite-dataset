The SME is effective field theory that contains the Standard Model, General Relativity, and all possible effective operators for Lorentz violation [1]. In the SME, LV and CPTV could manifest themselves at observable energies through a dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability on the direction of neutrino propagation with respect to the Sun-centered inertial frame. An experiment that has both its neutrino beam and detector fixed on the Earth's surface could then observe a sidereal modulation in the number of neutrinos detected from the beam.",

            "text": "MINOS is such an experiment [2]. It uses Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam [3] and two neutrino detectors -a near detector (ND) that is 1.04 km from the beam target and a far detector (FD) that is 735 km from the beam target. Both detectors are magnetized to approximately 1.4 T, allowing for the identification of \u00b5 \u2212 (\u00b5 + ) produced in charged-current (CC) neutrino (antineutrino) interactions. In a series of recent papers [4,5,6], MINOS searched for LV and CPT violation with neutrino and antineutrino data recorded in its detectors [7,8]. These analyses focused on detecting oscillation signals in neutrino and antineutrino flavor-changing reactions that vary with a sidereal period, as predicted by the Standard Model Extension (SME). MINOS found no evidence for LV and CPTV in these analyses. In the present paper, we extend the search for LV and CPTV using the timestamps of the neutrino data made available by the MINOS collaboration to look for sidereal signals that would indicate neutrinos changing to antineutrinos. Although there have been many searches for LV and CPTV with the SME [9], this is the first to probe the possibility of neutrino-antineutrino mixing.",

The event's LST was then converted to local sidereal phase, LSP = LST\u00d7(\u03c9 \u2295 /2\u03c0), a parameter in the range 0-1. Event times were not corrected for their time within a 10 \u00b5s spill, an approximation that introduces no significant systematic error into the analysis. The data for each spill were binned into two histograms. In one histogram, we added any interaction from each spill; in the second histrogram we added the number of protons impinging on the target (POT) for each spill. These two histograms have 32 bins in LSP because the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm we use to search for sidereal variations [14] works most efficiently for 2 N bins, where N \u2212 1 is the number of harmonics to be computed in addition to a constant term. Since the highest harmonic in Eq. (2) is 4\u03c9 \u2295 T \u2295 , we adopted N = 5 as the binning. Each phase bin spans 0.031 in LSP or 45 minutes in sidereal time.",

The values of p 99.7% (FFT) for all four harmonics lie between 3.40 -3.50, with p 2 = p 4 = 3.45.

It then calculates the probability that any neutrinos generated traverse the FD. The FD neutrino event simulation takes the neutrinos from the NuMI simulation, along with weights determined by decay kinematics, and uses this information as input into the simulation of the interactions in the FD. We inject a sidereal signal in the simulation by calculating the survival probability for each simulated neutrino based on Eq. (1) using a chosen value for the magnitude of the SME coefficient, the energy of the simulated neutrino, and the distance the neutrino travels to the FD. We start by setting the SME coefficient to zero and then continually increasing its magnitude until either p 2 or p 4 crosses the detection threshold of 3.45. We took this value of the SME coefficient to be its 99.7% C.L. upper limit. The SME coefficients can be either positive or negative, so this limit is the lower limit on the SME coefficient in the case it is negative. We repeated the simulation for this coefficient 250 times and averaged the resulting value of the coefficient.

We found no significant evidence for this predicted signal. When framed in the SME theory [17,18], this result leads to the conclusion that we have detected no evidence for Lorentz invariance violation, a result consistent with the analyses in [4,5,6]. We computed upper limits for the 66 SME coefficients appropriate to this analysis. These limits are the first to be calculated for the SME coefficients governing neutrino-antineutrino mixing. Table 3: Upper limits to the modulus of the Re parts of theg \u03b1\u03b2 ab coefficients describing neutrino-antineutrino mixing in the SME theory. The limits were determined from the 99.7% threshold for a positive sidereal signal in the neutrino rates in the MINOS FD. The Re and Im components of these SME coefficients are computed identically and are equal. ",
