This boson, called U , has been searched for in the decay \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 U , U \u2192 e + e \u2212 , analyzing the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 in a data sample of 1.7 fb \u22121 . No structures are observed in the e + e \u2212 invariant mass distribution over the background. This search is combined with a previous result obtained from the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , increasing the sensitivity. We set an upper limit at 90% C.L. on the ratio between the U boson coupling constant and the fine structure constant of \u03b1 \u2032 /\u03b1 < 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for 30 < M U < 400 MeV and \u03b1 \u2032 /\u03b1 \u2264 8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for the subregion 50 < M U < 210 MeV. This result assumes the Vector Meson Dominance expectations for the \u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 * transition form factor. The dependence of this limit on the transition form factor has also been studied.",

            "text": "There are theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) that postulate the existence of new bosons, mediators of some hidden gauge group, under which ordinary matter is uncharged [1,2]. Such theories have been recently invoked to account for some puzzling astrophysical observations and predict that at least one of the new bosons is neutral, relatively light and weakly coupled with ordinary matter [3,4]. The coupling is represented by adding to the Lagrangian a kinetic mixing term [5] between the new (U) boson and the photon, whose strength is measured by a parameter \u01eb that could be as large as \u223c 10 \u22123 . Due to this mixing, the U boson can be produced in processes involving SM particles, and can decay into e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ..., depending on its mass and on model-specific details.",

            "text": "Searches for the U boson have been recently performed at e-p fixed target facilities [6,7], and, in conjunction with a dark Higgs, at e + e \u2212 colliders [8], with null results. The U can also be searched for in vector (V ) to pseudoscalar (P ) meson decays, with a rate that is \u01eb 2 times suppressed with respect to the ordinary V \u2192 P \u03b3 transitions [9]. Since the U is supposed to decay to e + e \u2212 with a non-negligible branching ratio, V \u2192 P U events will produce a sharp peak in the invariant mass distribution of the electron-positron pair over the continuum background due to Dalitz decay events V \u2192 P e + e \u2212 . Using this approach, KLOE has already published a limit on the existence of the U boson [10], studying \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 e + e \u2212 decays, where the \u03b7 meson was tagged by its \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay. In this letter, we present an update of this analysis, which improves background rejection for the already used data sample (1.5 fb \u22121 ) and increases statistics by a factor of about three, exploiting also the neutral \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay chain, with a data sample of 1.7 fb \u22121 .",

The determination of the limit is done by varying the M U mass, with 1 MeV step, in the range between 5 and 470 MeV. Only five bins (5 MeV width) of the reconstructed M ee variable, centered at M U are considered. For each channel, the irreducible background, b(M U ), is extracted directly from our data after applying a bin-by-bin subtraction of the non-irreducible backgrounds and correcting for the analysis efficiency. The M ee distribution is then fit, excluding the bins used for the upper limit evaluation. The parametrization of the fitting function has been taken from Ref. [15].

For the combined procedure, the CL S evaluation is done by summing values over all bins of the two decay channels, taking into account the different luminosity, efficiency and relative branching ratios of the two samples. The systematic error on the background knowledge \u2206b(M ee ) is evaluated, for each M U value, changing by one standard deviation the two fit parameters and has been taken into account while evaluating CL S , applying a Gaussian spread of width \u2206b(M ee ) on the background distribution.

The SND experiment measured the form factor slope, b \u03c6\u03b7 = dF/dq [17], with a central value different from theoretical predictions based on VMD (b \u03c6\u03b7 \u223c 1 GeV \u22122 ) [18], although in agreement within the error. In Fig. 7 the smoothed exclusion plot at 90% C.L. on \u03b1 \u2032 /\u03b1 is compared with existing limits in the same region of interest [6,7,19]. The evaluation is done using both the experimental and the theoretical values of the form factor slope. The two resulting curves overlap at low M ee values, while the limit obtained using the SND measurement gives an increasingly larger exclusion region up to \u223c 400 MeV, moving closer to the other curve at the end of the phase space. Having the experimental value of b \u03c6\u03b7 an uncertainty of \u223c 50%, we conservatively use the curve obtained with theoretical predictions, resulting in a limit of: \u03b1 \u2032 /\u03b1 < 1.7 \u00d710 \u22125 for 30 < M U < 400 MeV, and even better for the sub-region 50 < M U < 210 MeV: \u03b1 \u2032 /\u03b1 < 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . Comparing our result with the previous KLOE measurement, reported as the dotted line in Fig. 7, we improve the upper limit of about a factor of two when using the same parametrization of the form factor. This result reduces the region of the U boson parameters that could explain the observed discrepancy between the measurement and Standard Model prediction of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a \u00b5 , ruling out masses in the range 60-435 MeV.
