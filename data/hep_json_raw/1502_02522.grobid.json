The limits are derived from the results presented in a recent search for long-lived charged particles in proton-proton collisions, based on data collected by the CMS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. In the pMSSM parameter sub-space considered, 95.9 % of the points predicting charginos with a lifetime of at least 10 ns are excluded. These constraints on the pMSSM are the first obtained at the LHC. Charginos with a lifetime greater than 100 ns and masses up to about 800 GeV in the AMSB model are also excluded. The method described can also be used to set constraints on other models.",

            "text": "We present new constraints on long-lived chargino production in the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) [1] and on the anomalymediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) model [2][3][4]. In the pMSSM, we consider the parameter sub-space for particle masses up to 3 TeV and charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 ) with a mean proper decay length (c\u03c4 ) greater than 50 cm. In the AMSB model, the small mass difference between the lightest chargino and neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) often leads to a long chargino lifetime. Long-lived charged particles are predicted by various extensions of the standard model (SM) [5][6][7], such as supersymmetry (SUSY) [8] and theories with extra dimensions [9,10]. If such particles have a mass lighter than a few TeV they could be produced by the CERN LHC. The energy available in the proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC is such that particles with mass 100 GeV and lifetime greater than O(1) ns could be observed with the CMS detec- * e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch tor [11] as high-momentum tracks with anomalously large rates of energy loss through ionization (dE/dx). These particles could also be highly penetrating such that the fraction reaching the CMS muon system would be sizable. The muon system could therefore be used to help in identification and in the measurement of the time-of-flight (TOF) of the particles. The signature described above is exploited in a previous CMS search [12], which sets the most stringent limits to date on a number of representative models predicting massive long-lived charged particles such as tau sleptons (staus), top squarks, gluinos, and leptons with an electric charge between e/3 and 8e.",

The method applied relies on the factorization of the acceptance in terms of two probabilities, calculated using the standard CMS simulation and reconstruction tools at 8 TeV. Moreover, the results of the acceptance calculations have been tabulated and made publicly available [13]. Thus this technique, which allows the signal acceptance for a model with long-lived particles to be computed using the kinematic properties of the particles at their production point, may in the future be used by others to evaluate constraints on other extensions of the SM without use of the CMS software.",

Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet. The tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and pro-vides a transverse momentum p T resolution of about 2.8 % for 100 GeV particles. The analog readout of the tracker also enables the particle ionization energy loss to be measured with a resolution of about 5 %. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes based on three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistiveplate chambers. The muon system extends out to 11 m from the interaction point in the z direction and to 7 m radially. Matching tracks in the muon system to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a transverse momentum resolution between 1 and 5 %, for p T values up to 1 TeV. The time resolution of the muon system is of the order of 1 ns. This provides a time-of-flight measurement that can be used to determine the inverse of the long-lived particle velocity as a fraction of the velocity of light (1/\u03b2) with a resolution of 0.065 over the full \u03b7 range [12]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, of the coordinate system, and of the kinematic variables can be found in Ref. [11].",

There can be significant differences in signal acceptance between the models investigated in Ref. [12] and the model to be tested.

Consequently, throughout this paper, mass thresholds of 0, 100, 200, and 300 GeV are used for true long-lived particle masses of m \u2264 166, \u2264330, \u2264500, and \u2265500 GeV, respectively. The choice of 100 GeV steps for the mass thresholds is made so that the information provided in Table 3 of Ref. [12] regarding the background expectation and the observed count in the signal region may be used, thus allowing a more general application of the factorization method. In the case where only one long-lived particle is present in each event, the probabilities have the simplest form P on (k) and P off (m thresh , k).",

The limits in this paper are established using the CL S approach [14,15] where p-values are computed with a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist technique [16].

The additional 10 % accounts for the systematic uncertainty incurred by the use of the fast estimation technique to compute the acceptance.

            "text": "The results in Table 1 may be compared with those shown in Table 7 and Fig. 8 of Ref. [12]. In making the comparisons, it should be noted that there are important differences in the way that m thresh is chosen in the two cases. In Ref. [12] the value was varied in steps of 10 GeV in order to optimise the resultant limit. In this paper a simpler approach has been followed with m thresh varied in 100 GeV steps and chosen to  be the largest value satisfying the condition m thresh \u2264 0.6m. The latter approach generally results in a somewhat higher estimation of the background and therefore a more conservative limit. In the most extreme case, the pair production of staus, with m = 308 GeV, the background is estimated to be 5.6 \u00b1 1.1 events with m thresh = 100 GeV, compared with the estimate of 0.7\u00b10.1 events obtained with m thresh = 190 GeV in Ref. [12], resulting in a cross section limit that is about three times higher in the former case. Nonetheless, the limits agree within \u223c15 % in almost all cases, allowing restrictive limits to be set on a general class of models. Because the online selection in Ref. [12] uses a missing transverse energy (E miss T ) trigger in combination with a single-muon trigger, there is one caveat to the proposed factorization method: the efficiency of the E miss T trigger cannot be modeled accurately in terms of single long-lived particle kinematic properties. Accounting for the presence of other undetectable particles using a Monte Carlo method would not help because E miss T often depends significantly on detector effects due to the other particles. The assumption that the E miss T trigger adds negligibly to the event selection performed by the muon trigger must therefore be satisfied in order to apply the method to a given signal. Deviations from this assumption would result in an underestimation of the signal acceptance. The assumption is satisfied by models with lepton-like long-lived particles. Models with long-lived colored particles, such as top squarks or gluinos, do not satisfy this condition and thus cannot currently be tested with the technique presented in this paper. Long-lived colored particles hadronize in color singlet bound states [19] that could interact with the detector material leading to complex situations, detailed in Refs. [12,20], and inducing significant instrumental E miss T . For instance, pair-produced colored long-lived particles may hadronize to a charged and a neutral hadron. In this case the E miss T is strongly modified by the presence of the neutral hadron since it is not visible in the tracker Table 2 Signal acceptance estimated from the fast technique and with the full simulation of the detector, as well as the corresponding expected and observed cross section limits. Results are provided for both the pair production and the inclusive production of staus as predicted by the GMSB model. The mass threshold, the corresponding expected background and the observed numbers of events is also shown and deposits only O(1) GeV in the calorimeter. Moreover, the interactions of the color singlet bound states with matter may lead to a modification of the electric charge of the bound states [19]. In this case, the hadron containing a long-lived colored particle can be electrically charged at production, but neutral in the muon system and therefore fail the muon reconstruction. The probabilities P on (k) and P off (m thresh , k) do not account for the possible modification of the electric charge experienced by the hadron-like particles. ",

Previous searches for AMSB charginos [26,27] looked for a chargino decaying within the tracking volume into a neutralino and a soft charged pion. The pion has a momentum of \u223c100 MeV and is generally not reconstructed. The experimental chargino signature therefore takes the form of a disappearing track inside the tracking system.

For each sample, 10 000 events are generated using an inclusive SUSY production and the acceptance of the search for long-lived particles is estimated using the technique described in Sect. 3. The estimated signal acceptance is shown in Fig. 5 (top). The acceptance is reduced for short lifetimes because the probability that a particle reaches the muon system before decaying, is exponentially smaller. As explained in Sect. 3, a systematic uncertainty of 25 % is assigned to the signal acceptance. A point in the masslifetime parameter space of the AMSB model is considered to be excluded when the 95 % CL observed limit on the cross section is lower than the leading-order theoretical cross section. The excluded region in this plane is shown in  (bottom). These results extend those from previous searches at LHC experiments [26,27] by excluding charginos with lifetimes 100 ns up to masses of about 800 GeV. While the signal acceptance remains nearly constant over a wide mass range, heavier charginos cannot be excluded because of their smaller production cross section. The sensitivity of the search for HSCP [12] is limited to charginos with an average lifetime \u22653 ns while previous searches based on short track signatures are sensitive to lifetimes of \u223c0.1 ns [26,27].",

            "text": "The results of the CMS search for long-lived charged particles have been analysed to set constraints on the phe-nomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) and on the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking model (AMSB), both of which predict the existence of longlived massive particles in certain regions of their parameter space. A novel technique for estimating the signal acceptance with an accuracy of 10 % is presented. This technique only uses generator-level information, while the integrated luminosity, the expected standard model background yields, and the corresponding uncertainties are taken from a previous CMS search [12]. The technique and the tabulated probabilities, available as supplementary material to this paper [13], can be used by others to estimate the CMS exclusion limits for different models predicting long-lived lepton-like particles. In the context of the AMSB model, charginos with lifetimes 100 ns (3 ns) and masses up to about 800 GeV (100 GeV) are excluded at 95 % confidence level. The most stringent limits to date are set on the long-lived sector of the pMSSM sub-space that covers SUSY particle masses up to about 3 TeV. In this sub-space, 95.9 % (100 %) of the points with a chargino lifetime \u03c4 \u2265 10 ns (1000 ns) are excluded by the present analysis of the results from the CMS search in Ref. [12]. These are the first constraints on the pMSSM obtained at the LHC. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.

Twenty samples, each containing one million stau particles, were produced for the following longlived particle masses: 100,126,156,200,247,308,370,432,494,557,651,745,871,1029, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, and 2500 GeV. These generated events were then processed by the full CMS simulation and reconstruction software. The full simulation includes pileup effects. The selection requirements adopted by the \"tracker+TOF\" analysis described in Ref.

The acceptance computed with the full simulation and with the technique presented in this paper agrees within 10 %. The agreement between the two techniques is worse when the mass threshold is close to the true mass of the long-lived particle. The larger disagreement close to the mass threshold is a consequence of the coarse binning of probability P off (m thresh , k), which only partially reflects the sharp variation in probability with the reconstructed values of p T , \u03b7, and mass. The reconstructed particle mass is generally lower than the actual particle mass because of a cutoff applied in the data acquisition electronics of the tracker detector. In Ref. [12], the threshold on the reconstructed mass is optimized for each signal model considered. In this paper, for the sake of simplicity, the threshold on the reconstructed mass used in the fast technique is set at 60 % of the true particle mass. The hatched area in Figs. 9 and 10 indicates the range not satisfying the requirement on the reconstructed mass threshold. Outside of this region the estimated signal acceptance is always compatible within 10 % with the results from full simulation.",
