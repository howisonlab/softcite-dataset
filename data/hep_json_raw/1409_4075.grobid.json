This was demonstrated within a framework of Minimal Simplified Dark Matter (MSDM) models with vector and axial-vector mediators exchanged in the s-channel [29]. While the collider phenomenology of the vector and axial-vector mediators is similar, at DD experiments they are very different. These two cases therefore demonstrate how to compare DD and collider results on an equal footing for two distinctive scenarios. Although these two mediator cases already cover a significant variety of interesting DM models, as we discuss below in more detail, it will be important to also consider t-channel exchanges as well as scalar and pseudoscalar mediators in the future.",

For g q = g DM 0.25 the 8 TeV CMS mono-jet search no longer has sufficient sensitivity to place a significant limit on the parameter space. Fig. 1 also shows the limit obtained from an interpretation of the mono-jet search in the framework of the EFT (green line). The EFT limits should agree with the MSDM limit in the domain where the EFT framework is valid. We see that it is only for the extreme coupling scenario g q = g DM = 1.45 that the EFT limit approximates the MSDM limit, and only for DM masses below around 300 GeV. For larger m DM the EFT fails to describe any of the coupling scenarios. For weaker couplings, the MSDM limits get stronger for DM masses below around 50-300 GeV, due to the resonant enhancement of the cross section for a s-channel mediator that was explained above. This effect is absent within the EFT framework. The reach in DM mass of the MSDM limits increases with larger couplings. Overall, this comparison of the EFT and MSDM limits demonstrates again that the EFT framework is unable to capture all of the relevant kinematic properties of the collider searches, which is demonstrated by the large disparity between the EFT and MSDM limits. Comparing EFT collider limits with those of DD searches gives a misleading representation of the relative sensitivity of the two search strategies, especially for weaker coupling scenarios and m DM 300 GeV.",

With the exception of light DM masses m DM 5 GeV, DD experiments provide much stronger limits for vector-mediated interactions. In the axial-vector case, the collider limits are generally stronger for m DM 300 GeV. This is especially true for small couplings where the collider cross section is further enhanced by the small mediator width.

We explore three scenarios for the LHC: 30 fb \u22121 at 13 TeV to gauge the reach of LHC Run 2, 300 fb \u22121 at 13 TeV to provide an estimate of the reach of LHC Run 3, and 3000 fb \u22121 at 14 TeV to show the expected reach of the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. For the DD experiments we show the estimated limit for the lifetime exposure of two liquid xenon experiments: the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment [45], with an exposure of 10 tonne years, 1 and DARWIN [47,48], with an exposure of 200 tonne years. We also show the discovery reach for DD experiments when limited by the coherent neutrino scattering background [49]. Figs. 2 and 3 show for the different coupling scenarios the current and projected 90% CL limits for the CMS mono-jet and DD searches in the (M med , m DM ) plane for the cases of an axial-vector mediator and a vector mediator, respectively. The conclusions are the same for the projected limits as for the current results. We predict similar complementarity between the collider and DD experiments going forward, with LUX, LZ and DARWIN retaining better sensitivity than the mono-jet LHC search for vector mediators for all but the very low m DM region, whereas for the axial-vector mediator the mono-jet search extends the reach of the DD experiments. As expected, the overall largest reach in the DM parameter space is obtained for the largest coupling scenario g q = g DM = 1.45. Whereas for vector interactions, shown in Fig. 3, none of the projected collider or next generation DD limits extend beyond the discovery reach, the situation for axial-vector mediators shown in Fig. 2 is different. For g q = g DM = 1.45, neither collider nor DD searches approach in any region of the M med -m DM plane the discovery reach. This changes for the weaker coupling scenarios, where for relatively low m DM the collider limits approach the DD discovery reach for g q = g DM = 1, and even go significantly beyond it for g q = g DM \u2264 0.5.",

This is explained by the fact that the planes use different observables to benchmark the performance of the search. In one case the mediator mass M med is the benchmark, whereas in the other case it is the nucleon-WIMP scattering cross section \u03c3 0 DD . As explained above, the cross section scales as (g q g DM ) 2 /M 4 med for DD experiments, and approximately like (g q g DM ) 2 /(M 4 med \u0393 med ) for the collider search. It is important to take these relations into account when translating between the two planes. For the example mentioned above, this implies that, whereas the collider limit on M med gets stronger with increasing coupling, when taking into account the factor (g q g DM ) 2 , it rules out less parameter space in \u03c3 0 DD as the coupling increases. Therefore, the results displayed in these two planes are fully consistent but represent different ways to benchmark the search. Depending on what observable is more relevant for the question at hand, either the (M med , m DM ) plane or the (\u03c3 0 DD , m DM ) plane might be more appropriate to answer it. We emphasize that the results and sensitivity projections presented here are valid for single vector or axial-vector mediator exchange, assuming equal coupling to all quarks. Experimentally, DD experiments probe a combination of the couplings to u and d quarks for vector exchange and to u, d and s quarks for axial-vector mediator exchange. This is in contrast to the mono-jet search. Although the production of the vector or axial-vector mediator is mainly sensitive to the coupling to u and d quarks, the mono-jet search is also very dependent on the mediator width \u0393 med , which depends on the couplings to all quarks into which the mediator can decay. This therefore motivates one direction in which the MSDM framework should be extended: scenarios with different hypotheses for the couplings to various flavours of quarks should be considered, since DD and mono-jet searches probe different weighted combinations of these couplings.",

These include for instance, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators, t-channel mediators and Majorana fermion or scalar DM scenarios. In addition, the collider searches are also sensitive to the properties of the mediator itself and hence results from several different topologies, such as di-jet and multi-jet events with missing transverse energy, can be combined to place limits on the MSDM parameter space. This is particularly relevant for scenarios where g DM \u0338 = g q (discussed further in Ref. [29]) since one interesting feature of these other channels is that they may probe different combinations of DM and quark couplings. For instance, di-jet searches should be considered as complementary to mono-jet searches since they provide additional constraints on the coupling g q alone. Other examples are found in Ref. [20], where it was demonstrated that orthogonal regions of parameter space can be constrained when mono-jet, mono-photon and di-jet searches are combined. Furthermore, multi-jet plus missing transverse energy topologies, as used to search for supersymmetric particle production at the LHC, will complement and may even improve the sensitivity of the mono-jet search by probing additional final states that are relevant to simplified models that predict significant jet activity in the final sate. Examples are scalar and pseudoscalar models, as discussed in [51][52][53][54].",

This opens the possibility of performing a global fit to a MSDM model, incorporating also the constraints from the indirect detection experiments, which are likely to provide important constraints on these MSDM models [55].

While the different collider and DD properties of vector or axial-vector mediators are excellent examples to demonstrate the complementarity of the two search strategies, an obvious extension of this proposal would be to also consider coupling scenarios where g q is not universal for all quarks and where g DM \u0338 = g q , scenarios with scalar and pseudo-scalar mediators as well as t-channel exchanges. For example, a MSDM description with scalar and pseudo-scalar mediators would provide some of the simplest realizations of a non-minimal Higgs sector where the Standard Model Higgs interacts and can mix with the (pseudo)scalar mediators. Therefore, such models provide a direct link with Higgs physics and it might even be possible that there is a common origin of the electroweak and the DM scales in Nature as it was recently explored in e.g. [56,57].",

We emphasize that all four parameters are important for translating the collider limits into equivalent DD experiment sensitivities.

This prompts us to formulate a proposal for a better-motivated procedure for comparisons of collider data with results from direct dark matter search experiments. This proposal is based on a particular implementation of simplified models, which is only one from several options for developing the comparison of DM searches at collider and DD experiments beyond the over-simplified EFT interpretation. The extension of the MSDM beyond the assumptions made in this White Paper will be important to make this approach complete. For instance, coupling scenarios where g q is not universal for all quarks or where g DM \u0338 = g q should be considered, and other mediators should be investigated, such as scalar and pseudoscalar interactions as well as t-channel exchanges. The interpretation framework advocated here represents a potential starting point for going beyond the EFT framework, but further additions to the MSDM model, as well as the consideration of alternative approaches, will be required to develop a general strategy for comparing collider and DD experiments in the future.",
