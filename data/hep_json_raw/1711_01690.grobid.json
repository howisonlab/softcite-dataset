No significant signals are observed in any of the studied production modes, and 90% credibility level (C.L.) upper limits on their branching fractions in \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays are obtained. The inclusive branching fractions of the \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays into final states with f 1 (1285) are measured to be B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 f 1 (1285) + anything) = (46 \u00b1 28(stat.) \u00b1 13(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03a5(2S) \u2192 f 1 (1285) + anything) = (22 \u00b1 15(stat.) \u00b1 6.3(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 .

For B(\u03c7 b1 \u2192 \u03c9 + anything), the branching fraction is measured to be (4.9 \u00b1 1.3(stat.) \u00b1 0.6(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22122 .

In the scalar channel, both LSR and FESR gave consistent mass predictions of a tetraquark state with a mass of (1.66\u00b10.14) GeV/c 2 . This numerical result favors the tetraquark interpretation of the possible \u03c1\u03c0 dominance in the D 0 decays. In the vector channel, the authors also conservatively estimated the mass of a tetraquark state to be in the mass region 1.18 \u2212 1.43 GeV/c 2 .

An 89.45 fb \u22121 data sample collected at \u221a s = 10.52 GeV is used to estimate the possible irreducible contributions from continuum (e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq, where q \u2208 {u, d, s, c}). Here, \u221a s is the center-of-mass (C.M.) energy of the colliding e + e \u2212 system. The data were collected with the Belle detector [21,22] operated at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [23,24]. Large Monte Carlo (MC) samples of all of the investigated tetraquark modes are generated with EVT-GEN [25] and simulated with a GEANT3-based [26] model for the detector response to determine the signal line-shapes and efficiencies. The angular distribution for the decay \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ is simulated assuming a pure E1 transition (dN/d cos \u03b8 \u03b3 \u221d 1 + \u03b1 cos 2 \u03b8 \u03b3 with \u03b1 = 1, \u2212 1 3 , 1 13 for J = 0, 1, 2, respectively [27], where \u03b8 \u03b3 is the polar angle of the \u03a5(2S) radiative photon in the e + e \u2212 C.M. frame); a phase space model in EVTGEN is used for the \u03c7 bJ decays. We use the phase space model for other decays as well. Note that the X tetra inclusive decays are modelled using PYTHIA [28]. Inclusive \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) MC samples, produced using PYTHIA with four times the total numbers of \u03a5(1S, 2S) events of the data, are used to identify possible backgrounds showing peak distributions from \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) decays.",

We perform a mass-constrained kinematic fit to the selected \u03c0 0 candidate and require \u03c7 2 < 10. To remove the backgrounds with K 0 S , the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass is required to be outside the [0.475, 0.515] GeV/c 2 range. After requiring the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 invariant mass to be within the \u03c9 signal region of 0.755 GeV/c 2  Fig. 7 shows the distributions of the energy of the \u03a5(2S) radiative photon in the C.M. frame, where the dots represent the \u03a5(2S) data and the cross-hatched histogram is from the normalized continuum contributions. We define the \u03c7 b1 signal region as 0.12 GeV < E * \u03b3 < 0.14 GeV and its sideband as 0.075 GeV < E * \u03b3 < 0.095 GeV or 0.18 GeV < E * \u03b3 < 0.20 GeV, which is twice as wide as the signal region. From the histogram, no \u03c7 b1 signal is present in the continuum contributions. After the application of the above requirements, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 invariant mass distribution from MC simulated \u03c7 b1 \u2192 \u03c9 +anything signal sample is shown in Fig. 8a. In the fit to this distribution, a Voigtian function is used for the \u03c9 signal shape and a second-order Chebyshev polynomial function is used for the background shape. Based on the fitted result, the efficiency is (10.9 \u00b1 0.1)%. Figure 8b shows the distributions of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 invariant mass from the \u03a5(2S) data (the dots with error bars) and the normalized \u03c7 b1 sideband events (the cross-hatched histogram). From the plot, the observed \u03c9 signals in the normalized \u03c7 b1 sideband account for most of the events in the \u03c7 b1 signal region.",

            "text": "For \u03a5(1S, 2S) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 + X tetra , the \u03c7 c1 is reconstructed via its decay into \u03b3J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 (\u2113 = e or \u00b5). Figure 10 shows the recoil mass spectra of \u03c7 c1 candidates in the \u03a5(1S, 2S) data, where the shaded histograms are from the normalized \u03c7 c1 sideband and the cross-hatched histograms show the normalized continuum contributions. See Ref. [17] for the definition of the \u03c7 c1 sideband and the normalization method of the continuum contribution. There are no evident signals for any of the X tetra states at any of the masses. In the entire region of study, the most significant signal is observed at an X tetra mass of 2.46 (2.26) GeV/c 2 and width of 0.3 (0.0) GeV with a statistical significance of 1.4\u03c3 (0.6\u03c3) in \u03a5(1S) (\u03a5(2S)) data. Since the number of selected signal candidate events is small, we obtain the 90% C.L. upper limit of the signal yield (N UL ) at each X tetra mass point by using the frequentist approach [30] implemented in the POLE (Poissonian limit estimator) program [31], where each mass region is selected to contain 95% of the signal according to MC simulations, the number of observed signal events is counted directly, and the number of expected background events is estimated from the sum of the normalized \u03c7 c1 sideband and continuum contributions. The systematic uncertainties discussed below are taken into account. The calculated upper limits on the numbers of signal events (N UL ) and branching fraction (B UL ) for each X tetra state with X tetra masses from 1.16 to 2.46 GeV/c 2 and widths from 0.0 to 0.3 GeV in \u03a5(1S, 2S) data are listed in Table II, together with the reconstruction efficiencies (\u03b5) and the systematic uncertainties (\u03c3 syst ). The results are displayed graphically in Fig. 11. For \u03a5(1S, 2S) \u2192 f 1 (1285) + X tetra , f 1 (1285) candidates are reconstructed via \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. Figure 12 shows the recoil mass spectra of the f 1 (1285) in \u03a5(1S, 2S) data, together with the backgrounds from the normalized f 1 (1285) sideband and the normalized continuum contributions. No evident X tetra signals are seen. An unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit repeated with X tetra masses from 1.46 to 2.46 GeV/c 2 in steps of 0.10 GeV/c 2 , and with X tetra widths from 0.0 to 0.3 GeV in steps of 0.1 GeV, is applied to the recoil mass spectra. The signal shape of each X tetra signal is described with a BW function convolved with a Novosibirsk function, where all parameter values are fixed to those from the fit to the MC-simulated signals. Since no backgrounds showing peak distributions are found, a second-order Chebyshev polynomial shape is used for the backgrounds. The fit result for the X tetra signal with its mass fixed at 1.66 GeV/c 2 (a theoretically predicted mass for a scalar tetraquark state [16]) and width fixed at 0.10 GeV is shown in Fig. 12. The fit yields 1.7\u00b14.7 (\u22120.3\u00b19.8) events for the X tetra signals in the \u03a5(1S) (\u03a5(2S)) data sample. In the whole mass region of interest, the most significant signal is observed at an X tetra mass of 2.26 (2.16) GeV/c 2 and width of 0.0 (0.3) GeV with a statistical significance of 1.1\u03c3 (1.8\u03c3) in \u03a5(1S) (\u03a5(2S)) data. For \u03c7 b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X tetra , the \u03c7 b1 is identified through the decay \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 b1 . Figure 13 shows the recoil mass spectrum of \u03b3J/\u03c8 in \u03a5(2S) data, together with the background estimated from the normalized J/\u03c8 sideband and the normalized continuum contributions. No evident X tetra signal is observed. An unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit is applied to the \u03b3J/\u03c8 recoil mass spectrum. The result of the fit with the X tetra mass fixed at 1.66 GeV/c 2 and width fixed at 0.10 GeV is shown in Fig. 13. This fit yields 8.9 \u00b1 5.8 X tetra signal events. In the entire region of study, the most significant signal is observed at an X tetra mass of 1.76 GeV/c 2 and width of 0.1 GeV, with a statistical significance of 2.8\u03c3.",

By changing the order of the background polynomial and the range of the fit, the model-dependent relative difference in the signal yields (or the upper limits for those modes with statistically insignificant branching fractions) is obtained; this is taken as the systematic error due to the uncertainty of the fit. The estimation of the continuum contributions in the f 1 (1285) inclusive production processes assumes a 1/s 2 dependence. The analysis is repeated assuming a 1/s or 1/s 3 dependence and the largest change in the fitted f 1 (1285) signal yield is taken as a systematic uncertainty. Assuming that all of these systematic-error sources are independent, the total systematic errors are summed in quadrature and listed in Table II for all the studied modes for each hypothesized X tetra mass.",
