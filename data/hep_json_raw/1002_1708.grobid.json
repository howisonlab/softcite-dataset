Even this relatively small increase in energy leads to a substantial increase in jet production with large transverse momentum, p T , by about a factor of three at p T = 500 GeV/c. The beam intensity is much higher than Run I due to the addition of the Main Injector and the Recycler Ring to the Fermilab accelerator complex.

The hadron structure is measured by many different experiments, especially lepton-hadron scattering experiments. The PDFs are determined by fitting these data and parametrized at a scale \u00b5 0 . The QCD evolution equations [7], currently available at NNLO in perturbation theory, are used to evolve these PDFs to any different scale \u00b5. The cross section is a convolution of the PDFs and the parton level cross section and, to be consistent, both must be calculated to the same order in perturbation theory. A complete calculation, including all orders in the perturbation series, must be independent of \u00b5 F , but a fixed order calculation depends on this choice. To evaluate the sensitivity to \u00b5 F , it is usually varied up and down by a factor of two. Scale dependencies are expected to decline with the addition of higher order terms in the calculation.",

On the other hand, event generators include hadronization, underlying event energy, and ISR/FSR to all orders in the leading-log approximation, but the hard interaction is calculated at LO only. Thus to compare data with QCD predictions, a hybrid scheme is generally used. The parton level NLO calculations are correcting for the underlying event and hadronization effects before they are compared with data. These corrections are determined using Monte Carlo event generators by comparing the jets obtained by clustering the pQCD partons with the jets obtained by clustering the partons after the showering process.

The events which do not satisfy this condition are rejected. For the n = 5 parton state, the showering algorithm is allowed to produce a higher jet multiplicity state.

The CDF collaboration measured the calorimeter response to charged hadrons and electrons using both pp collider and test beam data. The calorimeter simulation was tuned to reproduce the measured response. The calorimeter response to a jet was determined by a convolution of the single particle response with the type and momentum distribution of particles constituting a jet as given by a fragmentation model. CDF used QCD dijet events with the pythia fragmentation model to measure the default jet corrections. The pythia fragmentation model agreed well with the particle p T and multiplicity distributions in a jet measured in pp data. The herwig event generator was used to crosscheck the pythia fragmentation functions and the results determined using two generators were found to agree well. In this procedure, the difference in calorimeter response to gluon-initiated and quark-initiated jets is automatically included. Although this procedure requires a detailed knowledge of the calorimeter response and a well-tuned simulation, it has the advantages that the correction can be easily determined for any event topology over the entire kinematic range, and real and simulated data have the same corrections and thus can be treated on an equal footing.",

In QCD events, E / T arises mainly from fluctuations in calorimeter response and is much smaller than the total energy observed in the detector. Most of these background events are removed by requiring the ratio of E / T to the transverse momentum of the leading jet to be small. Remaining backgrounds are removed by requiring that the shape of energy deposition in the calorimeters be consistent with the expected shape from a hadronic jet. The shape of energy deposition for a jet is very different from the energy deposited by a cosmic muon or a beam halo particle, as a jet consists of many particles.

As two CDF measurements used the same data, the MSTW collaboration decided to use the k T jet spectrum whereas the CTEQ collaboration is using the cone-based measurements.

The new g(x) is lower than previous fits for x \u2265 0.3 but within the still large systematic uncertainties. As \u03b1 s and g(x) always appear as a product, the values of \u03b1 s and g(x) are strongly correlated.

The excited quarks q * decay into qg. Heavy vector bosons W \u2032 , Z \u2032 decay into qq or qq \u2032 . The axigluon A decays into qq, and E 6 diquarks D (D c ) decay intoqq(qq).

These models can be divided into three categories depending on the decay channel, i.e. gg, gq and qq. The expected mass shapes for q * , G * , W \u2032 , and Z \u2032 particles with a mass of 800 GeV/c 2 are shown in Figure 8. Because q * and G * decay into gluons, their widths are broader than the widths for W \u2032 and Z \u2032 . Gluons radiate more than quarks, resulting in a broader dijet mass distribution. These distributions are close and change the final limits by only 10-20%. These shapes can be used to search for resonance structure, independent of the model details. To measure the dijet mass spectrum [70], the CDF collaboration used the same data set as used in the inclusive jet cross section measurement described in Section V A 2 [46]. The dijet mass is reconstructed from the two highest p T jets using Jets produced by new physics are expected to be produced more centrally than by Standard Model processes and we expect a better signal to background ratio in the central region.",

The NLO pQCD predictions are computed using FastNLO [17] based on NLOJet++ [16]. These parton level predictions are corrected for the hadronization and underlying event contributions, which are evaluated using pythia. The theoretical uncertainties on the SM \u03c7 dijet distributions arising from the uncertainty on the PDFs and the uncertainty on renormalization and factorization scales are less than 2% and 5% respectively. These data are in good agreement with the SM predictions and thus are used to set exclusion limits in the parameter space of quark compositeness, ADD LED and TeV \u22121 models. Calculations for all these models are available only at leading order, while pQCD calculations can be performed at next to leading order. For this analysis, the expected distributions for each new model are calculated at LO and then scaled by kfactors (k = \u03c3 NLO /\u03c3 LO ) determined from pQCD calculations. The k-factors vary from 1.25 to 1.5. All these models predict a higher rate as \u03c7 dijet \u2192 1 and as m jj increases. However, the magnitude of the excess is different for different models. A Bayesian procedure [84] is used to obtain 95% C.L. limits on the mass scale parameters \u039b, M C and M S in the above models. The results in which the prior is chosen to be flat in the model cross section are given in Table II. Other choices give similar but slightly higher limits [83].",

The experimental uncertainty is still dominated by the uncertainty on the jet energy scale which is +31/-26% in the p T = 457 \u2212 527 GeV/c bin in 0.1 < |y| < 0.7 region for the CDF measurements and +16.0/-15.5% in the p T = 490 \u2212 540 GeV/c bin in |y| < 0.5 region for D\u00d8 measurements. Both  collaborations used a modern jet finding algorithm, the midpoint algorithm, which is infrared and collinear safe at next-to-leading order in pQCD for measurements of the inclusive jet cross section. In addition, the treatment of the underlying event energy and hadronization effects has improved over the techniques used in Run I. The experimental uncertainties are lower than the theoretical uncertainties, which are dominated by the uncertainties on the parton distribution functions. These data have been used in global fits to determine the parton distributions and have decreased the uncertainty on the gluon distribution for the x \u2265 0.3 region. The new gluon distribution is slightly lower than that determined by Run I jet cross section measurements. This increase in the accuracy of gluon distributions will make the prediction of various processes more precise.",

Because of these limitations, the Run II inclusive jet cross section has been primarily used to constrain the gluon content of the proton. The data at high y are particularly useful as it probes high x at lower Q values where the contribution of physics beyond the Standard Model, if any, is negligible. Due to the higher center of mass energy and much larger integrated luminosity, Run II jet measurements extend the jet spectrum to higher jet p T compared to the Run I measurements, by approximately 200 GeV/c. Both collaborations implemented an improved jet clustering algorithm. The jet clustering algorithms used in Run II are IR/collinear safe at least to the order of the available pQCD calculations. An accurate determination of the calorimeter response from the pp data and also a refinement in the techniques to determine the jet energy scale have lead to reduced uncertainty compared to Run I. In previous inclusive measurements, the hadronization effects were ignored as they were much smaller than both the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. In Run II, both collaborations have evaluated the effect of hadronization and corrected the parton level pQCD calculation. In addition, the pQCD calculations are corrected for the energy from the underlying event, determined using tuned event generators. In contrast, in Run I energy from the underlying event was removed from jets in data.",

Commonly available parton distributions from the MSTW and CTEQ groups include Tevatron jet data in the global fit. To avoid any correlation between the input PDFs and the extracted \u03b1 s , only 22 of 110 available jet data points are used. These selected points contribute to the x region (x \u2264 0.25) where PDFs in global fits are mainly determined by other experimental data and are not strongly influenced by Tevatron jet data. The jet data starts to affect g(x) at x \u223c 0.2. The change in g(x) due to inclusion of jet data is less than 5% for x 0.25 [55]. The central \u03b1 s (M Z ) result is obtained by minimizing \u03c7 2 with respect to \u03b1 s (M Z ) and integrating over the nuisance parameters for the correlated uncertainties. The variation of \u03b1 s (p T ) vs p T is shown in Figure 7 (top). The running of \u03b1 s as a function of jet p T follows the QCD evolution equation.
