The cross sections measured at \u221a s = 10.866 GeV and corrected for the initial state radiation are \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (2.27 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.14) pb, \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (4.07 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.45) pb, and \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(3S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (1.46\u00b10.09\u00b10.16) pb.

            "text": "Analysis of the \u03a5(10860) decays to non-BB final states has led to several surprises. Recently, the Belle Collaboration reported observation of anomalously high rates for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (n = 1, 2, 3) [1] and e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (m = 1, 2) [2] transitions measured in the vicinity of the \u03a5(10860) peak. If the \u03a5(nS) signals are attributed entirely to the \u03a5(10860) decays, the measured partial decay widths \u0393[\u03a5(10860) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] \u223c 0.5 MeV are about two orders of magnitude larger than the typical widths for the dipion tran-sitions amongst \u03a5(nS) states with n \u2264 4. In addition, the rates of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 processes are found to be comparable with those for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and hence the process with a spin flip of the heavy quark (that is, h b (mP ) production) is not suppressed. These unexpected observations indicate that an exotic mechanism might contribute to the \u03a5(10860) decays. A detailed analysis of the three-body e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 processes reported by Belle [3] revealed the presence of two charged bottomonium-like states, denoted as Z b (10610) \u00b1 and Z b (10650) \u00b1 . These two resonances are observed in the decay chains e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z \u00b1 b \u03c0 \u2213 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z \u00b1 b \u03c0 \u2213 \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The non-resonant contribution is found to be sizable in the \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channels and consistent with zero in the h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ones. Masses and widths of the Z \u00b1 b states have been measured in a (one-) two-dimensional amplitude analysis of the three-body (e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transitions [3]. Also, observation of the neutral Z b (10610) 0 partner has been reported recently by Belle [4]. Although the simplified angular analysis in Ref. [5] favors the J P = 1 + assignment for the two charged Z b states, the discrimination power against other possible combinations is not high enough to claim this assignment unequivocally.",

Electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) that covers the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system. Electron identification in Belle is based on a combination of dE/dx measurements in the CDC, the response of the ACC, and the position, shape and total energy deposition (i.e., E/p) of the shower detected in the ECL. The electron identification efficiency is greater than 92% for tracks with p lab > 1.0 GeV/c and the hadron misidentification probability is below 0.3%. The magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and K 0 L mesons. Muons are identified based on their penetration range and transverse scattering in the KLM detector. In the momentum region relevant to this analysis, the identification efficiency is about 90% while the probability to misidentify a pion as a muon is below 2%. We use the EvtGen event generator [8] with PHO-TOS [9] for radiative corrections and a GEANT-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation [10] to model the response of the detector and determine the acceptance. The MC simulation includes run-dependent detector performance variations and background conditions.",

The two-dimensional dis-   tribution of M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) versus M miss (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) for all selected candidates is shown in Fig. 1. Events originating from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process fall within a narrow diagonal band (signal region) that is defined as Fig. 1). Concentrations of events within the signal region near the \u03a5(nS) nominal masses are apparent on the plot. Clusters of events below the diagonal band are mainly due to initial state radiation e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S, 3S)\u03b3 processes and inclusive e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S, 3S)X (X = \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b7, etc.) production with a subsequent dipion transition of the \u03a5(2S, 3S) state to the ground \u03a5(1S) state. The onedimensional M miss (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) projections for events in the signal region are shown in Fig. 2, where an additional requirement on the invariant mass of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system, M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), is imposed (see Table I) to suppress the background from photon conversion in the inner parts of the Belle detector. We perform a binned maximum likelihood fit to the M miss (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distributions with a sum of a Crystal Ball function [11] for the \u03a5(nS) signal and a linear function for the combinatorial background component. The Crystal Ball function is used to account for the asymmetric shape of the \u03a5(nS) signal due to initial state radiation of soft photons. All parameters (seven in total) are free parameters of the fit. Results of the fits are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I. For the subsequent analysis, we select events around the respective \u03a5(nS) mass peak as specified in Table I. After all the selections are applied, we are left with 1905, 2312, and 635 candidate events for the \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03a5(3S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, respectively. The fractions of signal events in the selected samples are determined using results of the fit to the corresponding M miss (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) spectrum (see Table I). For selected events, we perform a mass-constrained fit of the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair to the nominal mass of the corresponding \u03a5(nS) state to improve the \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 invariant mass resolution.",

A set of physics observables is not unique and, in particular, depends on whether there is a resonant state in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or in the \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 system. As an example, a convenient set of observables for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z + b \u03c0\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is the following: masses M (\u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + ) and M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), the angle between the prompt pion and the beam axis in the c.m. frame (\u03b8 1 ), the angle between the Z + b and the \u00b5 + momenta calculated in the \u03a5(nS) rest frame (that is the \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 helicity angle, \u03b8 hel \u00b5\u00b5 ), the angle between the plane formed by the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system and the \u03a5(nS) decay plane in the Z b rest frame (\u03c6), and, finally, the angle between the plane formed by the prompt pion and the beam axis and the \u03a5(nS) decay plane calculated in the Z b rest frame (\u03c8). However, this set of observables is not convenient to parametrize amplitudes with a resonant state in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system (such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)f 0 (980)), thus we use these parameters only for visualization of fit results. The transition amplitude is written in Lorentz-invariant form as discussed in detail in Appendix. The six parameters in this case are invariant masses of six independent two-particle combinations composed of four final state particles (two pions and two muons from the \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and initial state electron and positron.",

Before analyzing events in the signal region, one needs to determine the distribution of background events over the phase space. Samples of background events are selected in \u03a5(nS) mass sidebands and then fit to the nominal mass of the corresponding \u03a5(nS) state to match the phase space boundaries for the signal. Definition of the mass sidebands and the event yields are given in Table I. Dalitz plots for the sideband events are shown in Figs. 3 (a, b, c), where M (\u03a5(nS)\u03c0) max is the maximum invariant mass of the two \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 combinations; here the requirement on M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is relaxed. For visualization purposes, we plot the Dalitz distributions in terms of M (\u03a5(nS)\u03c0) max in order to combine \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + and \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 \u2212 events. As is apparent from these distributions, there is a strong enhancement in the level of the background just above the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass threshold. This enhancement is due to conversion of photons into an e + e \u2212 pair in the innermost parts of the Belle detector. Due to their low momenta, conversion electrons and positrons are poorly identified by the CDC and so pass the electron veto requirement. We exclude this high background region by applying a requirement on M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) as given in Table I. The distribution of background events in the remainder of the phase space is parametrized with the sum of a constant (that is uniform over phase space) and a term exponential in M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) to account for an excess of background events in the lower M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) region. In addition, in the \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample, we include a contribution from \u03c1(770) 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. ",

Mass and width of \u03c3(500) are poorly defined from the data and are fixed at 600 MeV/c 2 and 400 MeV, respectively. The effect of this limitation on the fit results is included in systematic studies. Mass and coupling constants of the f (980) state are fixed at values defined from the analysis of B [13]. The mass and width fixed at world average values [14]. Parameters of Z b states are determined from the fit to data. A detailed description of the amplitude is given in the Appendix. For modes with higher \u03a5(nS) states, the available phase space is very limited, making it impossible to distinguish unambiguously between multiple scalar components in the amplitude. In these cases we fit the data with an amplitude given by Eq. 11, components with statistical significance below 3\u03c3 are then fixed at zero and the fit is repeated. As a result, in the nominal model used to fit the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data, we exclude the f 0 (980) amplitude.

Possible contributions from higher mass scalar states are effectively accommodated by a constant term of the non-resonant amplitude. The total numbers of fit parameters are 16, 14, and 10 for the final states with \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and \u03a5(3S), respectively.

To cross-check the separation power, we perform a MC study in which we generate a large number of \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 samples, each with statistics equivalent to the data and perform fits of each pseudo-experiment with different J P models.

The initial state radiation (ISR) correction factor (1 + \u03b4 ISR ) = 0.659 \u00b1 0.015 is determined using formulas given in Ref. [17], where we use e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section measured in Ref. [18]. The quoted uncertainty in the ISR correction factor is due to uncertainty in the \u03a5(10860) parameters, assumption on the non-resonance component and selection criteria. The integrated luminosity is measured to be L = 121.4 fb \u22121 , and the reconstruction efficiency \u03b5 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (including trigger efficiency and final state radiation) is determined from the signal MC events generated according to the nominal model from the amplitude analysis. For the branching fractions of the \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, the world average values are used [14]. Results of the calculations are summarized in Table IV. The Born cross section can be obtained by multiplying Eq. 5 by the vacuum polarization correction factor, |1\u2212\u03a0| 2 = 0.9286 [19]. The \u03a5(10860) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fractions listed in Ref. [14] can be obtained by dividing our results for \u03c3 vis in Table IV by the e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb cross section measured at the \u03a5(10860) peak, \u03c3 e + e \u2212 \u2192bb ( \u221a s = 10866) = 0.340 \u00b1 0.016 nb [20]. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainties contributing to the measurements of cross sections for the three-body e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transitions are given in Table V. The uncertainty in the signal yield is estimated by varying fit parameters within one standard deviations one by one and repeating the fit to the corresponding M miss (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution. The uncertainty in the muon identification is determined using a large sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events in data and MC and found to be 1% per muon. The uncertainty in tracking efficiency is estimated using partially reconstructed D * \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 D 0 [K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] events and found to be 0.35% per a high momentum track (muons from \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays) and 1% per a lower momentum track (pions). The uncertainty in the radiative correction factor is determined from a dedicated study. It is found to be due mainly to the uncertainty in the parametrization of the energy dependence of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section, the uncertainty in the c.m. energy and the selection criteria. All contributions are added in quadrature to obtain the overall systematic uncertainty of 6.2%, 10.9%, and 11.4% for n = 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Our results for \u03c3 vis (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) may be compared with the previous measurements by Belle performed with a data sample of 21 fb \u22121 [1] (see last line in Table IV).

For the \u03a5(3S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, we modify the nominal model by adding various components of the amplitude initially fixed at zero: a \u03a5(3S)f 2 (1270) component with an amplitude and phase fixed from the fit to the \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel.

The favored quantum numbers are J P = 1 + for both Z b states while the alternative J P = 1 \u2212 and J P = 2 \u00b1 combinations are rejected at confidence levels exceeding six standard deviations. This is a substantial improvement over the previous onedimensional angular analysis reported in Ref. [5]. This is due to the fact that the part of the amplitude most sensitive to the spin and parity of the Z b states is the interference term between the Z b \u03c0 and the non-resonant amplitudes. Thus, the highest sensitivity is provided by the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transition, where the two amplitudes Z b \u03c0 and the non-resonant one are comparable in size. The measured values of the spin and parity of the Z b states are in agreement with the expectations of the molecular model [21] yet do not contradict several alternative interpretations [22].",
