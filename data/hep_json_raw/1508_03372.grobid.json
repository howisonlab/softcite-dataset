The analysis is performed in the H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 had channel, where \u03c4 had is a hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton. The search is based on the data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. No statistically significant excess of data over the predicted background is observed. The observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limit on the branching fraction, Br(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 ), is 1.85% (1.24%).",

            "text": "The observation of the Higgs boson [1,2] with a mass of about 125 GeV [3] by the ATLAS and CMS experiments is a great success of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics program at CERN. The next important step in this program are searches for signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and detailed studies of the Higgs boson properties. Direct evidence for physics beyond the SM could be indicated via leptonflavour-violating (LFV) Higgs boson decays. If the SM is replaced with an effective field theory, which has a single Higgs boson and is required to be renormalizable only to a finite mass scale, then LFV couplings may be introduced [4]. LFV decays can also occur naturally in models with more than one Higgs doublet [5][6][7][8], composite Higgs models [9,10], models with flavour symmetries [11], Randall-Sundrum models [12] and many others [13][14][15][16][17][18].",

Indirect experimental constraints are reviewed and translated into constraints on Br(H \u2192 e\u00b5, \u00b5\u03c4, e\u03c4 ) in recent papers [4,19]. Searches for \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 [20] place a very stringent constraint on H \u2192 e\u00b5 decays: Br(H \u2192 e\u00b5) < O(10 \u22128 ) [4,19]. The indirect constraints on H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4, e\u03c4 decays mostly come from searches for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3, e\u03b3 [21][22][23] or other rare \u03c4 -lepton decays [24], as well as from measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the electron [25] and are much less stringent: Br(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4, e\u03c4 ) < O(10%) [4,19]. A relatively large Br(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 ) can be achieved without any particular tuning of the effective couplings, while a large Br(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) is possible only at the cost of some fine-tuning of the corresponding couplings [19].

The signature of LFV H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 decays used in this search is characterised by the presence of an energetic muon, originating directly from a Higgs boson decay and carrying roughly half of its energy, and the hadronic decay products of a \u03c4 -lepton. The data were collected with a single-muon trigger with a transverse momentum, p T = p sin \u03b8, threshold of p T = 24 GeV. The H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and the LFV H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 signatures with a muon and \u03c4 had in the final state share many common features.

To reduce the contamination of jets by additional interactions in the same or neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up), tracks originating from the primary vertex must contribute a large fraction of the jet p T when summing the scalar p T of all tracks in the jet.

These properties are exploited to suppress such backgrounds and define signal and control regions. Events with exactly one muon and exactly one \u03c4 had with p T (\u00b5) > 26 GeV, p T (\u03c4 had ) > 45 GeV and |\u03b7(\u00b5) \u2212 \u03b7(\u03c4 had )| < 2 form a baseline sample. The |\u03b7(\u00b5)\u2212\u03b7(\u03c4 had )| cut has \u223c99% efficiency for signal and rejects a considerable fraction of multi-jet and W +jets events. At this stage of the event selection, the identified muon is also required to be isolated [28] in the calorimeters and in the tracking detector in order to reduce contamination from the multi-jet background. Two signal regions are defined using the transverse mass, m T , 2 of the \u00b5-E miss T and \u03c4 had -E miss T systems: OS events with m T (\u00b5, E miss T ) > 40 GeV and m T (\u03c4 had , E miss T ) < 30 GeV form the signal region-1 (SR1), while OS events with m T (\u00b5, E miss T ) < 40 GeV and m T (\u03c4 had , E miss T ) < 60 GeV form the signal region-2 (SR2). Both signal regions have similar sensitivity to signal (see section 6). The dominant backgrounds in SR1 and SR2 are W +jets and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, respectively. The modelling of the W +jets background is checked in a dedicated control region (WCR) formed by events with m T (\u00b5, E miss T ) > 60 GeV and m T (\u03c4 had , E miss T ) > 40 GeV. As it is discussed in detail in section 4, the modelling of the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 background is checked in SR2. The choice of the m T cuts to define SR1, SR2 and WCR is motivated by correlations between m T (\u00b5, E miss T ) and m T (\u03c4 had , E miss T ) in H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 signal and major background (W +jets and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) events, as illustrated in figure 1. No events with identified b-jets are allowed in SR1, SR2 and WCR. The modelling of the tt and single-top backgrounds is checked in a dedicated control region (TCR), formed by events that satisfy the baseline selection and have at least two jets, with at least one being b-tagged.

In this approach, essential features such as the modelling of the kinematics of the produced boson, the modelling of the hadronic activity of the event (jets and underlying event) as well as contributions from pile-up are taken from data. Therefore, the dependence on the simulation is minimized and only the \u03c4 -lepton decays and the detector response to the \u03c4 -lepton decay products are based on simulation. This hybrid sample is referred to as embedded data in the following. A detailed description of the embedding procedure can be found in ref. [39]. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 normalization is a free-floating parameter in the final fit to data and it is mainly constrained by events with 60 GeV<m MMC \u00b5\u03c4 <110 GeV in SR2. The W +jets and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 backgrounds are modelled by the ALPGEN [40] event generator interfaced with PYTHIA8 [41] to provide the parton showering, hadronization and the modelling of the underlying event. In all W +jets events, the \u03c4 had signature is faked by jets. The WCR region is used to check the modelling of the W +jets kinematics and to obtain normalizations for OS and SS W +jets events. An additional overall normalization factor for the N W +jets OS\u2212SS term in eq. shape of the W +jets background in SR2 is assigned based on the 50% difference between the default m MMC \u00b5\u03c4 shape and the one obtained after applying the correction derived for SR1 events. The size of this uncertainty is below 5% in the 110 GeV< m MMC \u00b5\u03c4 <150 GeV region, that contains most of the signal events. It was also checked that applying the same correction in SR2 as in SR1 had a negligible effect on the final result and the extracted branching ratio Br(H \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 ) (see section 6) would only be affected at a level below 3%. The modelling of jet fragmentation and the underlying event has a significant effect on the estimate of the jet \u2192 \u03c4 had fake rate in different regions of the phase space and has to be accounted for with a corresponding systematic uncertainty. To estimate this effect, the analysis was repeated using a sample of W +jets events modelled by ALPGEN interfaced with the HERWIG [42] event generator. Differences in the W +jets predictions in SR1 and SR2 are found to be \u00b19% and \u00b12%, respectively, and are taken as corresponding systematic uncertainties.",

Less significant sources of experimental uncertainty, affecting the shape and normalization of signal and backgrounds, are the uncertainty on the jet energy scale [32,56] and resolution [57]. The uncertainties in the \u03c4 had energy resolution, the momentum scale and resolution of muons, and the scale uncertainty on E miss T due to the energy in calorimeter cells not associated with physics objects are taken into account, however, they are found to be relatively small. The following experimental uncertainties primarily affect the normalization of signal and backgrounds: the \u00b12.8% uncertainty on the integrated luminosity [58], the uncertainty on the \u03c4 had identification efficiency [34], which is measured to be \u00b1(2-3)% for 1-prong and \u00b1(3-5)% for 3-prong decays, the \u00b12.1% uncertainty for triggering, reconstructing and identifying muons [29,59], and the \u00b12% uncertainty on the b-jet tagging efficiency [33].",
