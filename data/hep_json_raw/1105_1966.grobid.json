We find that the fraction of J/\u03c8 coming from the feed-down decay of \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7c in the midrapidity region (|y| < 0.35) is 9.6 \u00b1 2.4% and 32 \u00b1 9%, respectively. We also present the pT and rapidity dependencies of the J/\u03c8 yield measured via dielectron decay at midrapidity (|y| < 0.35) and via dimuon decay at forward rapidity (1.2 < |y| < 2.2). The statistical precision greatly exceeds that reported in our previous publication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 232002 (2007)]. The new results are compared with other experiments and discussed in the context of current charmonium production models.",

Charm quarks are predominantly produced in initial gluon interactions at \u221a s = 200 GeV; therefore, they are sensitive to the gluon distribution in the nucleon and its modification in the nucleus. Color screening of the cc state in quark gluon plasma makes charmonium dissociation an important signature for the formation of a deconfined state of matter in A+A collisions [1,2]. However, such studies rely on an accurate understanding of charmonium production in p+p collisions, which is the goal of the present work.",

The model assumes that these charmonium states are formed in their final color singlet quantum number configuration. The production density matrix is coupled to the wave function at the origin, which is determined from potential models. The only empirical parameters in the entire calculation are the leptonic decay width and the charmonium mass used in the potential model. NRQCD allows for the production of both color singlet and color octet cc states. Color octet states emit one or more gluons during hadronization in order to neutralize their color. The production amplitude is expanded in powers of both the strong coupling, \u03b1 S , and the velocity, \u03bd, of the heavy quarks relative to the cc pair. The expansion in \u03bd assumes that the heavy quark is nonrelativistic 1 . As in the CSM, the production amplitudes are projected onto 2S+1 L J states. Since the potential model can only be applied to the color singlet state, a long range nonperturbative matrix element for each quarkonium state is taken from fits to experimental data. The earliest such matrix parametrization [8] was tuned with J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 cross sections observed in CDF ( \u221a s = 1.8 TeV) [9] which indicated that while P-wave charmonium (\u03c7 c ) has no important color octet state contributions, S-wave charmonium (direct J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 ) production is largely through color octet channels. Therefore, this model is sometimes simply referred to as the Color Octet Model (COM).",

The CEM is able to reasonably describe quarkonia yields observed in many experiments, but has no predictive power for cc polarization. Cross sections calculated using the CSM grossly underestimate the yields observed in CDF [9] and the previous PHENIX [10] measurements. Recent next-toleading-order (NLO) [11][12][13] and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) [14][15][16][17] calculations for the color singlet states resulted in significant modifications of the predicted charmonium yields and polarization, but still do not agree with experiment. NRQCD calculations tuned with J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 p T spectra from CDF were able to qualitatively describe the first PHENIX J/\u03c8 cross section and polarization results [18] albeit within large experimental uncertainties, but failed to describe the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 polarization observed in CDF [19] (see [15] for a recent review). Recent NRQCD calculations [20] include color singlet and color octet NLO short range terms along with a long-range matrix parametrization from experimental hadroproduction [21] and photoproduction [22,23] of J/\u03c8 mesons. A similar study was performed using CDF data with consistent results [24]. However, the NLO terms for the color octet [25] have only small corrections compared to the leading-order (LO) terms and the calculations still disagree with the J/\u03c8 polarization measured by CDF.",

In addition, the J/\u03c8 suppression observed in heavy ion collisions cannot be completely understood without a knowledge of the feed-down fraction of excited charmonium state decays to the J/\u03c8. This is particularly true under the assumption that the suppression is due to the disassociation of charmonium in the high temperature quark-gluon plasma, since lattice calculations [2] indicate that the melting points of the \u03c7 c and \u03c8 \u2032 states are lower than that of the J/\u03c8. In this work the feed-down fractions to the J/\u03c8 from excited charmonium states are measured, since they can be determined more precisely than production cross sections as various systematic uncertainties cancel.",

This paper reports the feed-down fraction of J/\u03c8 from \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7 c decays at midrapidity in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV. To accomplish this, we measured the \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 yield ratio in the dielectron channel and fully reconstructed the p+p \u2192 \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 + \u03b3 decay.

These provide more accurate measurements than previously published [10], particularly for the J/\u03c8 differential cross section at high p T .

An introduction to the PHENIX detector, a description of the data sample, and a description of the lepton identification method are given in Sec. II. The analysis is described in three sections: midrapidity J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 dielectron measurements in the PHENIX central arms are in Sec. III; direct \u03c7 c feed-down measurement in the central arms is given in Sec. IV; and forward rapidity J/\u03c8 measurements in the muon arms are described in Sec. V. The results are compared to those from other experiments and to current theoretical calculations in Sec. VI.  shows the PHENIX detector [29], which comprises four spectrometer arms plus detectors for event characterization and triggering. The\u1e91 axis lies along the beam line with the origin at the nominal center of the detector and points toward the north arm. Thex axis points towards the west central arm. The two central arms detect electrons, photons and hadrons in the range |\u03b7| < 0.35; each arm covers \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 radians in azimuth. The two forward muon arms detect muons in the range \u22122.2 < \u03b7 < \u22121.2 and 1.2 < \u03b7 < 2.4 with full azimuthal coverage. The rapidity dependence of observables is generally measured over the full acceptance of the muon arms, but p T -dependence studies are constrained to the symmetric range 1.2 < |y| < 2.2 in J/\u03c8 rapidity, allowing the forward and backward rapidity measurements to be averaged. It is clear from Fig. 1 that the acceptance and detector technologies for dimuons and dielectrons are very different in PHENIX, necessitating development of different analysis approaches.",

Electron candidates require at least one phototube above pedestal in the Ring Imaging\u010cerenkov detector (RICH) 2 , within an annulus 3.4 < R ring [cm] < 8.4 around the projected track position. In addition, the electron candidate is required to be associated with an energy cluster in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. Clusters must lie within 4\u03c3 position of the projected track position, and within 4\u03c3 energy of the expected energy/momentum ratio. The \u03c3s characterize the position and energy resolution of the EMCal, which comprises 6 Pb-Scintillator (PbSc) and 2 Pb-Glass (PbGl) sectors, each calibrated separately. The material between the center of the detector and the EMCal, corresponds to a radiation length of 0.4%, minimizing the production of \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 conversions. The granularity of the PHENIX detectors was driven by the very high multiplicity environment of Au+Au collisions. Consequently, the occupancy in p+p collisions is very low, and the relatively loose association requirement of 4\u03c3 position provides excellent hadron rejection. Based on the p T range of decay electrons from J/\u03c8 observed in real data and simulations, a minimum p T of 500 MeV/c was required for each electron candidate.",

Consequently, a hard process, such as one producing a J/\u03c8 or a high energy \u03c0 0 , will fire the MB trigger with a higher probability than, for example, a diffractive process. This implies a different MB efficiency for the event sample used in the current analysis. This effect was investigated using a data sample requiring the ERT trigger, but with no MB requirement. Given enough events one could, in principle, use the J/\u03c8 yield in an ERT-only triggered sample (after correction for any prescale factors) to estimate the MB coincidence requirement upon the yield. However, we did not have a sufficient number of ERT-only triggered events to make a statistically significant study of J/\u03c8 yields with and without satisfying the MB trigger. Since the relevant issue is the effect of a hard collision on the particle multiplicity, an alternate approach was taken. Several variants of the ERT trigger were implemented in parallel, with some requiring a high energy shower in the EMCal without a corresponding hit in the RICH (i.e. photon triggers). We counted \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays with a p T greater than 3 GeV/c using the photon trigger; in 79 \u00b1 2% of such events the MB trigger fired, indicating \u03b5 inel = 79 \u00b1 2%. No dependence of \u03b5 inel on the p T of the measured \u03c0 0 decays was found over the range 0-10 GeV/c . More details can be found in [35]. This factor is included as a correction in all cross section calculations requiring the MB trigger.",

These simulated data were then used to generate mass vs. p T histograms for each electron pair source. More details will be given later in Sec. III C, including methods of estimating systematic uncertainties. These were fit to real data distributions to determine the relative contribution of each source, as described in Appendix A. Figure 3 shows the results of the fit for the dielectron mass (a) and p T (b,c) projections of the two-dimensional histogram. The heavy flavor contribution to the continuum obtained from the fit using the shapes from the dielectron generator and pythia is shown in Fig. 3-d. When using the pythia simulation, the presence of back-to-back correlated cc and bb pairs produced more high mass pairs per cc which then forced a smaller contribution from bb. The fits performed using the two generators give very different normalizations for the open charm and the open bottom contributions. However, the two methods give very similar contributions for the sum which is well constrained by data. Thus lack of the knowledge of angular correlation in heavy flavor production does not affect the estimate of the total continuum contribution from open heavy flavor in the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 mass regions. The measurement of the cc and bb cross sections is not in the scope of this paper; a more detailed study can be found in [40,41,46]. Type A fit parameter uncertainties and the type B uncertainty obtained from the difference in results obtained using the two generators for the total heavy flavor contribution are summed in quadrature and shown as bands in The fitted external and internal radiation contributions in the data indicate that the fraction of radiative decays of the J/\u03c8, where the undetected photon has energy larger than 100 MeV, is 9 \u00b1 5 %. This is consistent with QED calculations which indicate that 10.4% of the dielectron decays from the J/\u03c8 come from such radiative decays and a measurement of fully reconstructed J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 performed by E760 [47] which gives 14.7 \u00b1 2.2 %. The J/\u03c8 mass peak around 3.096 GeV/c 2 has a Gaussian width from the fit of 53 \u00b1 4 MeV after including a mass resolution in the MC of (\u03b4M/M )=1.71 \u00b1 0.13 %. Because of the radiative tails, the mass range (2.7< M ee [GeV/c 2 ] <3.4) contains a fraction \u03b5 J/\u03c8 mass = 93.8 \u00b1 0.9% of the J/\u03c8 decays and the mass region (3.5< M ee [GeV/c 2 ] <3.9) contains a fraction \u03b5 \u03c8 \u2032 mass = 86 \u00b1 2% of the \u03c8 \u2032 decays; these corrections are included in the yield calculations. Finally, the fractions of charmonium decays f \u03c8 used in Eq. 6 The detector response to J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 dielectron decays was studied using the geant3-based Monte-Carlo simulation. Malfunctioning detector channels were removed from the detector simulation and from the real data analysis. The geometric acceptance of the detector Monte-Carlo calculation was compared to that for real data using simulated \u03c0 0 decays. This channel is used because the majority of the electrons found in real data come from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays and photons, which convert in the detector material. In this study, simulated electrons from \u03c0 0 decays were weighted to match the collision vertex and p T distributions observed in the data. Figure 4 shows the simulated and real electron track distribution as a function of the azimuthal angle, \u03c6, measured at the DCH radial location. The ratio between real and simulated track distributions f acc (\u03c6 DCH , z DCH ) is used later to estimate the systematic uncertainty of the J/\u03c8 acceptance. in Fig. 5. The combinatorial background, determined from like-sign pairs, is negligible in this very low mass region. No electron identification criteria are applied in the sample. The Dalitz decays are dominant near zero mass whereas \u03b3 conversions are peaked at 20 MeV/c 2 . This is because their primary source is in the beam pipe while the track reconstruction assumes that particles originate from the vertex and traverse the entire magnetic field. We assume all pairs above the combinatorial background in the mass region below 0.30 GeV/c 2 are true dielectrons. The electron identification efficiency was obtained from the fraction of dielectron conversions which survive the identification criteria are applied to both the electron and positron compared to the number of dielectron conversions obtained after requiring identification for only one electron or positron. The same procedure was repeated in the simulation. Figure 6 shows the electron identification efficiency as a function of the p T of the electron in question. The difference in efficiency between simulation and data for electrons with p T > 0.5 GeV/c was no larger than 0.8%, which translated to an overall type B uncertainty in the dielectron yield of 1.1%. Simulated J/\u03c8 dielectron decays were generated with uniform p T and rapidity (|y| < 0.5) and the measured vertex distribution. The fraction of the generated J/\u03c8 decays that were fully reconstructed corresponds to the product of the acceptance and electron identification efficiency of the detector (A \u00d7 \u03b5 eID ); this is shown for electrons from decays of J/\u03c8 at rapidity |y| < 0.5 in Fig. 7-a. When each simulated electron decay was weighted according to f acc (\u03c6 DCH , z DCH ) given previously, the number of reconstructed J/\u03c8 decays was modified by 7.5%. This is essentially the variation in our acceptance calculation, using a data driven method compared to simulation. We treat this difference as a type B systematic uncertainty. The A \u00d7 \u03b5 eID for simulated \u03c8 \u2032 dielectron decays in the same rapidity range was larger than that from the J/\u03c8 by between 5-20% because of its larger mass. The maximum difference occurs at p T \u223c2.5 GeV/c . The detector acceptance for charmonium also depends on the orientation of its electron decay with respect to the momentum direction of the parent particle because of the charmonium polarization. The correction factor from polarization (\u03b5 pol ) was evaluated using a measurement of J/\u03c8 polarization [18] in p+p collisions interpolated to the relevant transverse momentum. The uncertainty in \u03b5 pol due to the uncertainty in the polarization was assigned as a type B systematic uncertainty. In the p T region where there is no polarization measurement (p T > 5 GeV/c for J/\u03c8 and all p T for \u03c8 \u2032 ) the one standard deviation uncertainty was calculated assuming the J/\u03c8 polarization in this region could be anything between -1 and 1. Figure 7-b shows the p T dependence of \u03b5 pol .",

This profile is based on the response of the EMCal to electron beam tests performed before the EMCal installation [49]. Energy clusters that were closer than four standard deviations (of the energy cluster position resolution) to reconstructed charged tracks were rejected, in order to remove electron and misidentified hadron contributions.

The mass of the measured e + e \u2212 pair is subtracted from the mass of e + e \u2212 \u03b3 in order to cancel the effect of the mass resolution of the e + e \u2212 pair. The remaining resolution in the subtracted mass distribution is from the energy resolution of the measured photon. The resolution of the mass distribution M e + e \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212M e + e \u2212 is dominated by the photon energy resolution of the EMCal. The analysis is complicated by the fact that most photons from \u03c7 c decays have energy close to the lower limit of the EMCal sensitivity.

The \u03c7 c0 is not considered in the simulation because of its small branching ratio to J/\u03c8 of 1.14 \u00b1 0.08 % [48]. Figure 12 shows the mass and \u03b3 energy distribution of e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays of simulated \u03c7 c . The conditional acceptance of the \u03b3 from the \u03c7 c is plotted as a function of the J/\u03c8 momentum in Fig. 13. The geometric acceptance of the \u03c7 c can be affected by its polarization and the polarization of the decay J/\u03c8. There is no measurement of the \u03c7 c polarization, but simulation studies show that the overall acceptance is modified by at most 5.6% if the \u03c7 c is totally transversely polarized. This possible modification was included in the acceptance type B correlated to the J/\u03c8 , which will be discussed later. The combinatorial background from random e + e \u2212 pairs (i.e. the combinatorial background to the J/\u03c8 in the \u03c7 c decay) is well described by the sum of e + e + \u03b3 and e \u2212 e \u2212 \u03b3 mass distributions. The mass distribution of random (e + e \u2212 ) + \u03b3 combinations (i.e. random J/\u03c8+\u03b3 pairs) was obtained using the invariant mass distribution of e + e \u2212 pairs from one event and photons from another event. In order to obtain the combinatorial background as realistically as possible, events used to form the e + e \u2212 and \u03b3 combination were required to have event vertices within 3 cm (2\u03c3 of the vertex position resolution) of each other.",

The MuID panel-by-panel efficiency used in these simulations was estimated from reconstructed roads in real data, or in cases with low statistics, from a calculation based on the operational history record for each channel. A systematic uncertainty of 4% on the J/\u03c8 yield was assigned due to the variation of the MuID efficiency during each data-taking period. The charge distribution in each part of the MuTr observed in real data and the dead channels and their variation with time over the data-taking period were used to give an accurate description of the MuTr performance within the detector simulation. The azimuthal distribution of muon candidates in real data and simulated muons from J/\u03c8 decays using the pythia simulation are shown in Fig. 18. The z vertex distribution of simulated J/\u03c8 decays is the same as that observed in real data, and the p T distribution in the MuTr obtained in simulation was weighted to match that observed in real data. The relatively small differences in the real and simulated \u03c6 distributions visible in Fig. 18 are thought to be due primarily to missing records for short periods of time in the dead HV channel maps. These differences are estimated to change the J/\u03c8 dimuon yields by up to 6.4 (4.0)% in north (south) arms.

            "text": "The models used in our comparisons were described in Sec. I; namely, the Color Evaporation Model (CEM), the Color Singlet Model (CSM) and nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD). The CEM used FONLL calculations for the charm cross section and CTEQ6M for the parton distribution functions [52,53]. For the CSM comparison, we used the recent NLO calculation only for the direct J/\u03c8 yield at RHIC energy and PHENIX rapidity coverage [17]. We used two NRQCD calculations [20,51] in our comparisons. The calculation performed for the direct J/\u03c8 plus \u03c7 c feed-down in [20] uses NLO diagrams for the color singlet and color octet states with a long range matrix element tuned from experimental hadroproduction [21] and photoproduction [22,23] results. This calculation is only available for the differential p T dependent cross section. An older calculation, performed for the same direct J/\u03c8 plus \u03c7 c feed-down with LO diagrams [51], also provides the rapidity dependence and total cross sections for different PDFs. No similar attempt has been made with the new calculations. The differential p T dependent cross section calculation involves the emission of a hard gluon which determines the shape of the charmonium p T spectrum. The amplitude of the hard gluon emission cannot be calculated for p T < 2 GeV/c because of infrared divergences. This problem is circumvented in the older calculation by empirically constraining the low p T nonperturbative soft gluon emission to obtain the rapidity dependence, d\u03c3/dy. In both NRQCD calculations there is a prevalence of color octet states in the direct J/\u03c8 contribution.",

All models are available with the CTEQ6M PDFs. The NRQCD model is also available with the GRV98 [54] and the MRST99 [55] PDFs. The theoretical rapidity distributions exhibit a similar shape when using CTEQ6M. A very different rapidity distribution is obtained when the NRQCD prediction is calculated using GRV98 and MRST99 (MRST99 is not shown). These observations suggest that the choice of PDF plays the most important role in describing the shape of the J/\u03c8 rapidity distribution. The rapidity shape also appears to be independent of the feed-down contributions, since the CSM has a similar shape to the CEM and NRQCD model, despite the fact that it contains only direct J/\u03c8 contributions. The PDF which best describes the data is CTEQ6M and we use this for the remaining comparisons.",

Rapidity distributions based on charmonium production models were not used in the total cross section in order to avoid any theoretical bias. The correlated uncertainties between data points measured in each spectrometer were propagated to the fit uncertainty by allowing the points to move coherently in the rapidity range covered by that spectrometer. Table XI shows the total dilepton cross section and the \u03c7 2 probability for each function used in the fit. The final cross section is obtained from the average of the numbers from each fit function. The systematic uncertainty from the unknown rapidity shape is taken from the standard deviation between the three fitting functions. Based on these fits, we conclude that the PHENIX rapidity acceptance covers 56 \u00b1 2 % of the total J/\u03c8 cross section. The J/\u03c8 cross section reported in this paper is 180.1 \u00b1 2.0(stat) \u00b1 17(syst) nb, in agreement with our previous result with a reduction in the statistical and systematic uncertainties. Table XII presents the measured total J/\u03c8 cross section and the expectations from the three production models considered in this text. The experimental direct J/\u03c8 cross section is estimated assuming that the feed-down fraction of \u03c7 c and \u03c8 \u2032 measured at midrapidity is the same at forward rapidity. The feed-down from B mesons is only significant at high p T and is not considered in the total cross section. The total cross section estimated using the CEM is the only one which agrees with the experimental result, although the cross section calculation includes the scale factor F (Sec. I) obtained from J/\u03c8 measurements. The NRQCD includes color singlet and color octet states, and as mentioned at the beginning of this section, cannot be extrapolated to low p T to obtain the rapidity distribution without the addition of an empirical constraint.  Figure 23 shows the the (a) p T and (b) x T = 2p T / \u221a s dependence of the dielectron differential cross section at midrapidity, compared to other p+p and p +p experiments [9,21,[64][65][66]. The shapes of the transverse momentum distributions in Fig. 23-a follow the well known \"thermal\" exponential behavior for p T < 2 GeV/c and a hardscattering power law behavior at high p T . Figure 23-b shows that the hard process scales with x T ( \u221a s n Ed 3 \u03c3/d 3 p = G(x T )) [67] for x T >0.1 in all collision energies, where n = 5.6\u00b10.2 [65] (n is related to the number of partons involved in the interaction). A pure LO process leads to n = 4, hence, NLO terms may be important in J/\u03c8 production [68][69][70][71]. xT distribution (b) of J/\u03c8 yield in CDF [9,21], UA1 [64], PHENIX (this work), STAR [65], and ISR [66] at y \u223c 0.",

However, the NLO CSM calculation gives a good description of the J/\u03c8 polarization measured by PHENIX [17,18]. Attempts are being made to extend the CSM to NNLO. Preliminary NNLO CSM calculations performed for p T > 5 GeV/c [17] show a large increase in the yield, but still under-predict the experimental results.

Because of their larger size compared to the J/\u03c8, excited charmonium states may have a different breakup cross section in nuclear matter. This effect can modify the feed-down fractions in p+A collisions. On the other hand, if the cc is not formed as a color singlet, it can cross the nuclear matter as a colored preresonant state [86]. If this were true, the breakup cross section of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 should be the same and there would be no modification of the \u03c8 \u2032 feed-down fraction in p+A collisions, whereas a possible modification can occur for the \u03c7 c since it is expected to be formed mainly as a color singlet. Given the large statistical uncertainties in all measured \u03c8 \u2032 / (J/\u03c8) ratios shown in Figs. 8-b and 25, differences between p + p and p+A are impossible to see, and therefore no conclusion about possible cold nuclear matter effects can be made at this time. The same is true for the \u03c7 c feed-down fraction in Fig. 26. Higher precision measurements of charmonium states in p+p and d+Au collisions in the future may allow an improved determination of these possible cold nuclear matter effects on the feed-down fraction.",

            "text": "The behavior of charmonium states in the high density hot nuclear matter created in heavy ion collisions has long been of interest [1]. Spectral function computations [2] indicate that the \u03c7 c and \u03c8 \u2032 states should dissociate due to color screening at a lower temperature in hot nuclear matter than the J/\u03c8. One of the most important implications of the observed feed-down fractions is that the complete dissociation of the \u03c7 c and \u03c8 \u2032 states would lead to a 42 \u00b1 9 % J/\u03c8 suppression. The measured nuclear modification factor of J/\u03c8 mesons in central Au+Au collisions at \u221a S N N =200 GeV [28] implies a suppression of 74 \u00b1 6 % at midrapidity and 84 \u00b1 6 % at forward rapidity. Hence, the complete dissociation of the excited states of charmonium and the associated loss of the J/\u03c8 yield cannot completely explain its suppression observed in Au+Au collisions. Cold nuclear matter effects and the possible dissociation of direct J/\u03c8 by color-screening could presumably account for the remaining suppression.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have measured the yields of the three most important charmonium states in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV, where gluon fusion is expected to be the dominant production process. These results are the baseline for PHENIX measurements of the nuclear-modification factor, R AA , in nucleus-nucleus collisions [26,27]. The rapidity dependence of J/\u03c8 production supports the use of CTEQ6M [44] to describe the gluon distribution in protons. The inclusive J/\u03c8 yield is in agreement with current models which involve the initial formation of colored charmonium states, as in the CEM [52,53] or the color octet states of the NRQCD models [51]. The inclusive J/\u03c8 yield observed at midrapidity comprises 9.6 \u00b1 2.4% of \u03c8 \u2032 decays and 32 \u00b1 9% of \u03c7 c decays. This result is in agreement with other experiments. Given the current large statistical uncertainties, no conclusion can be made about collision energy or p T dependence of these fractions. The J/\u03c8 suppression observed in Au+Au collisions cannot be totally explained by the dissociation of \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7 c , given the feed-down fraction results presented. together with the fit uncertainties represented as bands. The resulting \u03c7 c counts for each correlated background assumption are listed in Table XIV. The average \u03c7 c count was 96 \u00b1 24. The standard variation of these three counts was 4.6% which is considered as a systematic uncertainty.",

An estimate of the \u03c7 c p T distribution was obtained by fitting the \u03c7 c signal and backgrounds to a two dimensional e + e \u2212 \u03b3 mass vs. p T distribution obtained from data. While the statistical uncertainties in the resulting p T dependent number of \u03c7 c decays are large, the dependence of the acceptance on the p T of the \u03c7 c is mild, hence the uncertainty in the mean conditional acceptance is small. We obtain (\u03b5 \u03c7c /\u03b5 J/\u03c8 ) = 12.0 \u00b1 0.4 %. The transverse momentum dependence of the \u03c8 \u2032 /(J/\u03c8) yield ratio ( Fig. 8-b) is consistent with that observed in other experiments. Figure 25 shows the collision-energy dependence of the \u03c8 \u2032 /(J/\u03c8) yield ratio in low-atomic-mass fixedtarget p+A, p+p , and p+p [9,64,66,[73][74][75] collisions. The ratios from p +p experiments were calculated using the reported J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 cross sections for p T > 5 GeV/c together with their point-to-point uncorrelated uncertainties 3 . The B meson decay contribution was removed from the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 yields, in the case of the CDF experiment [9]. Only E705 [73] has broad coverage (\u22120.1 < x F < 0.5), while the other experiments shown have a rapidity coverage of |y| < 0.6. A weak trend of increasing \u03c8 \u2032 /(J/\u03c8) yield ratio for higher collision energy ( Fig. 25) and for higher p T (Fig. 8-b) can be observed. As mentioned earlier, the \u03c8 \u2032 feed-down fraction of 9.7 \u00b1 2.4 % is in agreement with the world average of 8.1 \u00b1 0.3 % calculated in [76].  . CEM estimate an energy and p T independent \u03c7 c feed-down of 40% [52] whereas recent NLO NRQCD calculations estimate 25-30% at p T = 10 GeV/c [85]. Therefore, are both consistent with the data.",

The free parameters controlling these smearing factors are \u03c3 ext and \u03c3 int which correspond to the dielectron channels and the radiative channel, respectively. The mass peak width \u03c3 int and position m shif t parameters of the radiative J/\u03c8 decay are determined in the fit. The fraction of radiative J/\u03c8 decays is compared to QED calculations in Sec. III A. No mass shift parameters are needed for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 . The fitting result is shown in Fig. 3 and its interpretation is found in Sec. III A.",
