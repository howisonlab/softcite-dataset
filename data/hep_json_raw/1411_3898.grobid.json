The latter method is generally referred to as mixed events. However, it must be pointed out that the observed values of the parameters r and \u03bb depend to a great extent on which reference sample is used. This is clearly seen in Fig. 1 where the values of \u03bb and r found for charged-pion pairs from hadronic Z decays by the \uf76c\uf765\uf770 experiments \uf761\uf76c\uf765\uf770\uf768 [4,5], \uf764\uf765\uf76c\uf770\uf768\uf769 [6], \uf76c3 [7] and \uf76f\uf770\uf761\uf76c [8][9][10] are displayed. Solid points are corrected for pion purity; open points are not. This correction increases the value of \u03bb but has little effect on the value of r. All of the a e-mail: W.Metzger@science.ru.nl results with r > 0.7 fm were obtained using an unlike-sign reference sample, while those with smaller r were obtained with a mixed reference sample. The choice of reference sample clearly has a large effect on the observed values of \u03bb and r. In comparing results we must therefore be sure that the reference samples used are comparable.",
