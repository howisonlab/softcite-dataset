A combined angular and mass analysis separates six helicity amplitudes and allows the measurement of the longitudinal polarisation fraction f L = 0.201 \u00b1 0.057 (stat.) \u00b1 0.040 (syst.) for the B 0 s \u2192 K * (892) 0 K * (892) 0 decay. A large scalar contribution from the K * 0 (1430) and K * 0 (800) resonances is found, allowing the determination of additional CP asymmetries. Triple product and direct CP asymmetries are determined to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations. The branching fraction B(B s \u2192 K * (892) 0 K * (892) 0 ) is measured to be (10.8 \u00b1 2.1 (stat.) \u00b1 1.4 (syst.) \u00b1 0.6 (f d /f s )) \u00d7 10 \u22126 .",

This decay has been discussed in the literature as a possible field for precision tests of the SM predictions, when it is considered in association with its U-spin symmetric channel B 0 \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 [1][2][3]. In the SM, the expected CP violation in the former is very small, O(\u03bb 2 ), with approximate cancellation between the mixing and the decay CKM phases [4]. When a scalar meson background is allowed, in addition to the vector-vector meson states, six independent helicities contribute [4].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The acceptance decreases as cos \u03b8 i approaches 1. This feature is mainly induced by the requirement on the minimum p T of the daughter pions. This effect is modelled by a two-dimensional function in cos \u03b8 1 and cos \u03b8 2 , which is extracted from simulation. Since the trigger system uses the p T of the charged particles, the acceptance effect is different for events where signal tracks were involved in the trigger decision (called trigger-on-signal or TOS throughout) and those where the trigger decision was made using information from the rest of the event (non-TOS). The data set is split according to these two categories and a different acceptance correction is applied to each subset. D and A 3 D where the correlation is calculated to be close to 90%. The main systematic uncertainty in these measurements is associated to the angular acceptance correction. Discrepancies in the p T spectra and the particle identification efficiencies between data and simulation are used to modify the acceptance function obtained from simulation. Systematic uncertainties are determined from the variation in the measured asymmetries when this modified acceptance is used.
