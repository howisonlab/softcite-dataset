Contrary to previous fast simulation studies, e.g. [3], [4], [5], it is entirely based on full detector simulation of SUSY processes (signal as well as background), all Standard Model (SM) backgrounds, and ILC machine background. The main objective of the study was to asses the capabilities of the ILD detector in processes particularly sensitive to beam-beam background and detector hermeticity. It is also a good probe for the particle identification capabilities and momentum resolution of the detector. Furthermore, as several fast simulation studies have been performed in the past on similar models, the results presented in this work will give the opportunity to validate these results under more realistic conditions, and thus gain confidence on the validity of such studies in other channels. Finally, the rich phenomenology of SPS1a' makes it a good model to underline the advantages of having an electron-positron collider that is tunable both in energy and beam polarisation.",

The model not only accounts for the active elements, but also for support structures, for cables and cooling systems, and dead regions in the sensitive layers. In the TPC, the properties of the P5 gas mixture was taken into account [13], resulting in a parametrisation of the point error depending on both drift distance and local track-pad angles. Two aspects of the detector, relevant for the present study, were simulated in less detail: The specific energy loss in the TPC was estimated by the theoretical Bethe-Bloch formula, taking into account the actual TPC geometry and read-out granularity, to yield an estimate of the separation power between different particle species [14]. This estimate was used to simulate the dE/dx-based particle identification on a track-bytrack basis. Furthermore, the response of the BeamCal to high energy electrons was estimated by tracking the electron to the BeamCal, and then determining the probability of detection from a map of the expected energy density from beamstrahlung pairs, and a parametrisation of the probability to detect an electron of a given energy above a given background energy density. Both the map and the parametrisation were obtained from a separate full simulation study of the BeamCal alone.",

Jet finding was performed in two ways: for the polarisation analysis, where no beam induced background was overlaid, the standard Durham algorithm was used [21], forced to yield two jets. In the mass analysis, the overlaid beam induced background implies that such a method has too low an efficiency due to extra tracks and clusters from the background. In this case, reconstructed particles to be considered for the jet clustering were first selected by demanding that all particles should have an energy exceeding 500 MeV, and that any charged particle should have at least one hit in the TPC. To exclude neutrals reconstructed from showers induced by the beam background, it was demanded that they should not be reconstructed from hits in the BeamCal, nor should the reconstructed starting-point of the shower be deep in the innermost part of the forward hadronic calorimeter (|z| > 3200 mm and r < 500 mm). Then the algorithm used in DELPHI to find \u03c4 leptons in\u03c4 events was used [22]. This algorithm -to be applied only after selecting low charged multiplicity events -goes through all possible combinations of charged tracks, trying to combine them into groups with invariant masses of M jet < 2 GeV, under the condition that if several such groupings were possible, the one with the lowest sum of jet-masses should be taken. In a second step, neutrals were added to the charged groups, still respecting the maximal mass. Any neutrals left over were labelled as belonging to the ROE group (\"Rest Of Event\").",

A veto against large energy deposits at small angles was therefore imposed. The events that remained did so because the beam remnants escaped the detector through the incoming or outgoing beampipe. This limits the missing transverse momentum P T , and implies that the visible system consists of two fermions almost back-to-back in the transverse projection. In the direction of the incoming beampipe of the other beam, a much larger deflection of the beam remnant could pass undetected, so a cut on P T needs to depend on the azimuthal angle of the missing momentum.",

The background fit was subtracted from the observed spectrum, and the background-subtracted spectrum was fitted with a straight line in the range from 30 to 41.5 GeV. As the dominating background stems from SM processes, it can be argued that, once ILC data is available to tune the SM simulation, the background will be known to a precision much better than what can be determined from the present simulation. Therefore, the error on the expectation value of the background was assumed to be negligible compared to its Poisson fluctuations. Hence, the error on the background fit was not propagated into the statistical errors. Under these assumptions, the result of the fit was E \u03c4,max = 42.11 +0.14 \u22120.12 GeV. One notes that this number is not compatible with the true value (42.54 GeV, with mass effects in the \u03c4 decay included). The difference is 1.1%, equal to 3.1 \u03c3. It reflects the fact that a straight line is not quite adequate to describe the spectrum near the endpoint.

It needed either to be estimated from data, or to be reduced so much that even a very large uncertainty of its expected level had little influence on the final number. In principle, one could use the fact that the\u03c4 1 signal is decreased in P beam = (+0.3, \u22120.8), while the SUSY background is largely enhanced to get an equivalent, but almost signal-free, sample. However, it was quite difficult to reduce th\u1ebd \u03c4 1 signal to negligible levels. This would necessitate a thorough study of the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 channel, which was beyond the scope of the present study. Instead, another approach was used: by requiring that at least one jet had an energy above 25 GeV, and none had an energy above 42 GeV, and that no jet was identified as a single lepton, the total SUSY background was reduced to 49 events, accompanied by 18 SM events, while 2226 signal events still remained.

In th\u1ebd \u03c4 2\u03c42 sample, 3156 events remained, while 360 SUSY background and 339\u03c4 1\u03c41 events also passed the cuts. As the main background at this level was found to be W W \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd, it was requested that the other jet was not a single electron or muon, since the probability, in W W \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd events, that a genuine \u03c4 from one W -decay is accompanied by an electron or muon on the other side is 78 %, while it is only 35 % for a \u03c4 from a\u03c4 decay.

These events were rejected by requiring that the most energetic jet should not be an electron or a muon. Finally, a likelihood ratio was formed of the joint distributions of q jet1 cos \u03b8 jet1 and q jet2 cos \u03b8 jet2 for signal and SM background, as shown in Fig. 7. The jet charges q jet,i are determined by the charge sum of the tracks in the jet, without any momentum weighting. The ratio of the two distributions was symmetrised along the diagonal and fitted with a multi-quadratic function, in order to smooth out the statistical fluctuations. The likelihood ratio exploits the fact that the distribution of lepton momenta in W W \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd events is forward peaked and forward-backward asymmetric, contrary to the signal. The final SM background was 2257 jets in 1533 events, while the signal was 3227 jets in 1972 events (22.3 % efficiency).

It should also be pointed out that only the decay mode\u03c4 2 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c7 0 1 contributes in the region where the fit was done: the cascade decays via a\u03c7 \u00b1 1 yield jets of energies of at most 25 GeV. The endpoint was found to be E \u03c4,max = 150.2 +2.0 \u22121.7 GeV. In this case, the simple straight line fit is sufficient: the value found is compatible with the true value (152.2 GeV).

To observe P \u03c4 , one uses the fact that only one helicity state exists for \u03bd \u03c4 , which induces a angular distribution \u221d 1 \u2212 aP \u03c4 cos \u03c8 for the visible decay products in the \u03c4 rest frame [28] (\u03c8 is the angle between the helicity axis and the momentum, and a is a factor depending on the mass and spin of the \u03c4 decay product). The lab frame energy spectrum is therefore sensitive to P \u03c4 . If, in addition, the decay product is a vector, the probability of the product being transversely or longitudinally polarised also depends on P \u03c4 : one case would correspond to a (more likely) conservation of helicity, the other to a (less likely) helicity flip. Whether the vector particle is transverse or longitudinal can be determined by the angular distribution of its decay products: in the rest frame of a two-body decay to scalars, the products tend to line up along the spin axis in the longitudinal case (\u03be = 0), and to be perpendicular to it in the transversal case (\u03be = \u03c0/2). In the lab frame, the longitudinal case therefore corresponds to a case where the energies of the two scalars are maximally different, while in the transversal case they tend to be quite similar. In particular, the variable R = E 1 /(E 1 + E 2 ) is distributed as (1 \u2212 \u03b2 vector cos(\u03be)), which is quite insensitive to the lab frame energy of the vector particle, once it is substantially larger than its mass (i.e. \u03b2 \u2248 1). R will be distributed as (R \u2212 1/2) 2 for the longitudinal case, and as 1/4 \u2212 (R \u2212 1/2) 2 in the transversal case [3]  [28]. In SPS1a', the mixing is not particularly large 3 , and\u03c4 1 is expected to be mainly right-handed. Hence, P \u03c4 is expected to be rather close to +1, and the spectrum in the \u03c4 \u2192 scalar should be harder than for the other helicity. In the case \u03c4 \u2192 vector, the vector meson is mainly longitudinal, yielding an R distribution peaking close to 0 and 1.",

The uncertainty of the average background stemmed from the uncertainty on its SUSY component, while the average of the SM component would have a negligible uncertainty. No signal-free sample with composition and spectrum close to that of the background in the selected sample could be constructed in this analysis. Hence, the background cannot be determined from the data itself, and one must rely on MC modelling. One could assume that no other data set than the ILC data will exist to validate a SUSY simulation, so the uncertainty of the model would be determined by the uncertainty of the ILC data itself. It is also essential that the sample used to verify the the SUSY simulation contains as little of the signal-channel as possible.

Most prominently, the smearing of four-vectors with design goal resolutions has been replaced by a detailed simulation of the various sub-detectors, including support structures, read-out, coolling etc. Further realism has been added by including not only background from Standard Model processes and from beamstrahlung pairs, but also from other (non-signal) SUSY processes, not always taken into account in the previous studies. The consideration of these additional backgrounds required improvements of the \u03c4 reconstruction and of the signal selection cuts. After these efforts, the achieved precision on the M\u03c4 1 and on the \u03c4 polarisation is comparable to previous studies. Precise quantitative comparisons would need to take into account the different SUSY scenarios and accelerator parameters which have been used. The expected precision for the\u03c4 2 mass and cross section have not been evaluated in either of the previous studies.",
