The Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays are reconstructed from a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton with a single charged particle in the final state, accompanied by a \u03c4 lepton that decays leptonically. The \u03c4 polarisation is inferred from the relative fraction of energy carried by charged and neutral hadrons in the hadronic \u03c4 decays. The polarisation is measured in a fiducial region that corresponds to the kinematic region accessible to this analysis. The \u03c4 polarisation extracted over the full phase space within the Z /\u03b3 * mass range of 66 < m Z /\u03b3 * < 116 GeV is found to be P \u03c4 = \u22120.14\u00b10.02(stat)\u00b10.04(syst).

It is a measure of the degree of parity violation in the interaction producing the \u03c4 leptons and therefore it provides insight into the nature of its Lorentz structure. The positive (negative) helicity states and righthanded (left-handed) chiral states coincide in the relativistic limit assumed here. 1 Due to nearly exact CP invariance in \u03c4 decays, the kinematic distributions for left-handed (righthanded) \u03c4 + follow those of right-handed (left-handed) \u03c4 \u2212 . Therefore, in this paper only one of the equivalent CP states is mentioned at a time with the other being implicitly assumed. Any possible differences are negligible for the measurement described in this paper. The \u03c4 polarisation in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays was first measured at LEP in electron-positron annihilation events at the Z boson pole. The experiments at LEP published the P \u03c4 spectrum as a function of the angle between the directions of the \u03c4 \u2212 lepton and the e \u2212 beam [1]. The most precise value of the average \u03c4 polarisation was obtained in the combination of LEP results and presented in terms of the \u03c4 production asymmetry, A \u03c4 , which, by convention, has reversed sign with respect to the polarisation and contains small (O(0.005)) corrections for the interference between the Z boson and photon propagators as well as for the pure photon contribution. The asymmetry value obtained in the combination is A \u03c4 = 0.1439 \u00b1 0.0043 [1].",

It is performed by analysing Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays in which one \u03c4 decays leptonically (\u03c4 \u2192 e/\u03bc + \u03bd\u03bd) and the other hadronically (\u03c4 \u2192 hadron(s) + \u03bd). The leptonic decay is utilised to trigger, select, and identify Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 candidate events, while the hadronic decay serves as a spin analyser. The qq \u2192 Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal has been observed before by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations [6][7][8]. Due to the abundance of background processes, strict requirements are applied to select a sufficiently pure sample of Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays from the proton-proton collision data. Further requirements are dictated by the detector acceptance. The overall acceptance is larger for Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays with left-handed \u03c4 \u2212 . To provide a result that is close to the polarisation directly observed in the selected signal region, the \u03c4 polarisation is measured in a fiducial region, which is defined at stable-particle level and very similar to the selected signal region. The polarisation is predicted by using simulated event samples produced with the Alpgen [2] event generator interfaced with the Pythia6 [3] parton shower and hadronisation model. The \u03c4 lepton decay and spin effects are simulated with the Tauola [4] decay library using sin 2 \u03b8 eff W = 0.23147 in the electroweak leading-order (LO) matrix element to simulate polarisation and spin correlations in the Tauola Universal Interface [5]. The prediction in the fiducial region is P \u03c4 = \u22120.270 \u00b1 0.006.",

Away from the Z boson mass peak, the degree of polarisation varies with m Z /\u03b3 * and is determined by the interference between Z boson-and photonmediated amplitudes. An inclusive measurement over a mass range around the Z boson pole is performed here, because the contributions slightly above and below the Z boson pole cannot be separated accurately. The Z /\u03b3 * interference has approximately the opposite effect on the polarisation below and above the Z boson pole. Therefore, and because the onpole cross-section is dominant, the polarisation inside the mass-selected region of 66 < m Z /\u03b3 * < 116 GeV is close to P \u03c4 at \u221a s = m Z . The prediction by the Alpgen event generator interfaced with the Pythia6 parton shower and hadronisation model and Tauola library for \u03c4 decays is P \u03c4 = \u22120.1517 \u00b1 0.0014 (stat) \u00b1 0.0013 (syst). This is different from the P \u03c4 value in fiducial region because some of the event selection requirements, such as transverse momenta thresholds, prefer one \u03c4 helicity state over another. For the extrapolation from the selected signal region to the full phase space inside the Z /\u03b3 * mass range, the \u03c4 \u03c4 contribution is assumed to originate from Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays. In particular, the spin correlations of the two \u03c4 leptons are assumed to be those for unit-spin intermediate states. The \u03c4 decays are assumed to follow the Standard Model expectations.",

The concept to extract the polarisation from a template fit to a polarisation sensitive observable is retained from that analysis. To exploit the larger dataset collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV, refined experimental techniques for \u03c4 polarisation measure-ments at hadron colliders are utilised for the measurement presented in this paper. In particular, the impact of systematic uncertainties in the modelling of the polarisation observable for signal events and the significant backgrounds are estimated more thoroughly, because they are more important in the current measurement using a larger dataset. These techniques may serve as a foundation for future polarisation measurements in decays of the Higgs boson or \u03c4 \u03c4 final states with high invariant mass. A good understanding of \u03c4 polarisation in Z boson decays is indispensable for these measurements. Moreover, the polarisation itself provides a potential discriminant in Standard Model Higgs boson selection and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular it may help to distinguish decays of heavy particles where the same final states involving \u03c4 leptons are predicted but with different helicity configurations, such as for separating Z and H or A bosons or for distinguishing W and H \u00b1 bosons.",

The TauSpinner algorithm averages over incoming parton flavours and four-momenta whereas the Tauola algorithm directly accesses the incoming partons in each event. The average over initial parton states is performed using the MRSTMCal PDF set [16] in this analysis. Spin correlations as expected in Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays are assumed. The TauSpinner package was extensively tested and validated by its authors [15,17,18] and used in several measurements [19,20].",

This requirement suppresses event topologies in which the E miss T lies outside of the angle spanned by the \u03c4 candidate and the lepton, which are common for W +jets processes and rare for signal events. In addition, the visible mass of the \u03c4 had candidate and lepton, m vis = m(\u03c4 had-vis , lepton), is required to satisfy 40 < m vis < 85 GeV to further reduce backgrounds, notably the non-signal Z /\u03b3 * +jets background in which the Z /\u03b3 * boson decays to electron or muon pairs.

This is insufficient for separating Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays on and off the Z boson pole. The selection criteria described above define the selected signal region of this analysis. Some of the object and event selection requirements have different acceptances for signal decays with one specific \u03c4 \u2212 helicity state: the p T,lepton requirement is about twice as efficient for Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events with leptonically decaying left-handed \u03c4 \u2212 leptons as for those with leptonically decaying right-handed \u03c4 \u2212 leptons. Here, the polarisation of the \u03c4 had is affected due to spin correlations resulting from angular momentum conservation in Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays. This is partially counteracted by the p T,\u03c4 had-vis and m T requirements. These biases result from dependencies of the \u03c4 lepton momentum share carried by neutrinos on the helicity state and the respective decay modes. The size of this effect may be different for possible unexpected contributions from physics processes other than from intermediate states with unit spin decaying to \u03c4 pairs. Hence the polarisation is also measured in a fiducial region which is defined with stableparticle-level quantities (see Table 2). It corresponds very closely to the selected signal region.

Some of the input variables [40] used in \u03c4 had identification are strongly correlated with \u03d2. A mismodelling of these input variables may thus cause differences between the shapes of the \u03d2 distributions in data and the simulation causing errors specific to this analysis. These errors were studied in detail and are estimated by comparing the \u03c4 had identification input variable distributions of \u03c4 had candidates in W +jets and top pair events in the data and the simulation. The observed differences are propagated through the analysis. The resulting uncertainties are referred to as \u03c4 had identification uncertainties in the following.",

In contrast to observables such as masses of heavy particles, which are commonly exploited in analyses studying decay channels that involve \u03c4 leptons, the reconstruction of \u03d2 is unaffected by the presence of neutrinos in \u03c4 decays. It is therefore particularly sensitive to the modelling of the \u03c4 had-vis energy response. Consequently, detailed studies were performed to provide a thorough understanding of the related uncertainties. The Tau Energy Scale (TES) uncertainty for \u03c4 had decays is evaluated based on the single-hadron response in the calorimeters that was studied in Ref. [40]. The uncertainty is a function of \u03b7 and E T and is generally near 3%. A mismodelling of the energy response to hadrons and to photons may affect the \u03d2 templates in different ways. For \u03c4 had candidates with \u03d2 values around +1, most of the energy originates from hadrons, mostly charged pions. Conversely, photons that arise from \u03c0 0 decays typically carry a large fraction of the energy for candidates with \u03d2 values close to \u22121. This is accounted for by splitting the TES uncertainty from Ref.",

These are the QCD factorisation and renormalisation scales, the \u03b1 s coupling and the PDFs. Since the uncertainties may be mass dependent, they are calculated for three different mass ranges around the Z boson peak (66-116, 81-101, and 88-92 GeV).

Three of the parameters related to \u03c4 had identification uncertainties account for the systematic variation of the input variables that may significantly affect the modelling of the signal template shapes in the simulation. The remaining two \u03c4 had identification parameters exclusively vary the normalisation of the signal and background templates according to the uncertainties estimated in the tagand-probe studies from Ref. [40]. The correlations of the normalisation and shape uncertainties are not known and the parameters are treated as uncorrelated. It was verified that the correlation assumed has a negligible effect on the overall uncertainty. One parameter controls each of the variations caused by migrations from the left-handed to right-handed signal subsamples and vice versa, accounting for the signal sample splitting uncertainties. The correlations of these parameters are also unknown. They are treated as uncorrelated. Their impact on the polarisation uncertainty would be reduced, if they were assumed to be fully correlated instead. One parameter controls each of the variations of the hadronic and electromagnetic components of the TES and TER in the signal templates. The remaining TES parameters account for the TES uncertainty in the backgrounds. One of them is ded- Fig. 5 Post-fit \u03d2 distributions for the \u03c4 e -\u03c4 had (left) and \u03c4 \u03bc -\u03c4 had (right) channels, and for the signal (top) and same-sign (bottom) regions for the fit that extracts the \u03c4 polarisation in the mass-selected region of 66 < m Z /\u03b3 * < 116 GeV icated to Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 ee events, in which one of the electrons is misidentified as a \u03c4 had candidate.
