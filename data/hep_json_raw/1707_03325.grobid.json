The strong production of top squark pairs can produce events with pairs of top quarks and neutralinos, with each bino-like neutralino decaying to a photon and a gravitino. The search is performed using a sample of pp collision data accumulated by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The final state consists of a lepton (electron or muon), jets, and one or two photons. The imbalance in transverse momentum in the events is compared with the expected spectrum from standard model processes. No excess event yield is observed beyond the expected background, and the result is interpreted in the context of a general model of gauge-mediated SUSY breaking that leads to exclusion of top squark masses below 650-730 GeV.",

Of particular interest are the \"natural\" models of SUSY in which several SUSY partners (sparticles) of SM particles are expected to be light, such as the third-generation squarks and the Higgsinos [19,20]. In such SUSY scenarios, the fine-tuning required to maintain low mass of the electroweak scale can be avoided. Many light top squark searches are being pursued at the LHC [21][22][23][24][25][26].",

This search is motivated by models of gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) [27][28][29] in which the neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ) is the next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP) and the gravitino (G) is the lightest sparticle (LSP). The gravitino escapes undetected and contributes to missing transverse momentum ( p miss T ) in the detector, where the magnitude of p miss T is referred to as p miss T . This search considers a bino-like neutralino that decays to a photon and a gravitino. Assuming that R-parity [30,31] is conserved, pair production of sparticles would be the dominant production mechanism for SUSY particles in pp collisions at the LHC. Because top squarks are expected to be relatively light in natural SUSY scenarios, we search for top squark pair production, a strong process. Assuming a bino-like neutralino NLSP, each top squark would decay to a top quark and a neutralino, with the neutralino decaying to a photon and a gravitino, leading to a tt+\u03b3\u03b3+p miss T topology. This event topology is shown in figure 1.",

In the elec-tron+jets channel, however, these processes contribute more to the background, especially at low p miss T , because the probability for an electron to be misidentified as a photon is much greater. This electron misidentification rate can be determined from the size of the peak at the Z boson mass in the invariant mass distribution of electron-photon pairs in the electron+jets channel of SR1. This rate depends on an estimate of the number of selected Z bosons in the electron+jets channel, the accuracy of which can be improved through the implementation of a scale factor (SF ) extracted to normalize the Z+jets and Z+\u03b3 MC events in both the electron and muon channels. The SF is measured imposing a dilepton selection similar to the one used in the SR1 selection, but altered to require two same-flavor leptons rather than just a single lepton. Events with additional leptons are vetoed, and no photons are required. A fit to the invariant mass of the dilepton system in data, using the Z+jets and Z+\u03b3 MC events as the signal template and all other MC events as background templates, provides a normalization scale factor for both the Z+jets and Z+\u03b3 MC events, labeled SF Z(\u03b3) , in the electron and the muon channels.",

As stated in the introdcution, no explicit tt+\u03b3\u03b3 sample is used in the background estimate because of the exceedingly small cross section for such events. The sources of two photon events in SR2 are largely the result of jets or electrons misidentified as photons as described above, or of initial or final-state radiation as predicted by pythia. While the precise photon purity in each signal region is important for absolute measurements, no difference in the overall shape of simulated p miss T is found when altering the purity of selected photons. The maximum bin-by-bin difference between the simulated p miss T of tt+jets and tt+\u03b3 events is found to be 5%. When their relative normalizations are adjusted to the observed photon purity in data through a fit to the photon isolation variable, the result is well contained within the statistical uncertainties in the p miss T distribution. The p miss T distribution in both signal regions is found to be insensitive to the source of selected photons in tt+jets and tt+\u03b3 backgrounds, and, as such, no dedicated tt+\u03b3\u03b3 sample is required. To eliminate any dependence on the overall production rate of tt+\u03b3 events, the normalizations of tt+jets and tt+\u03b3 backgrounds are allowed to float freely in the calculations of upper limits, so that the interpretation of the results is based completely on the observed shapes of the distributions.",

No significant deviation is found in the distribution of the missing transverse momentum between data and expected SM backgrounds that would indicate the presence of new physics. Upper limits on signal cross sections are calculated for a range of top squark and bino masses. Top squark masses between 650 to 730 GeV are excluded at the 95% CL corresponding to the neutralino mass range of 500 to 150 GeV, respectively. These top squark mass points are obtained using the \u22121\u03c3 theoretical excursion from the observed exclusion mean. These results set the most stringent exclusions on top squark masses in gauge-mediated supersymmetric model considered here.",
