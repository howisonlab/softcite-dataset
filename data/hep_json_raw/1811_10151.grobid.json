The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and 2017, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb \u22121 . In the examined scenario, a pair of scalar leptoquarks is assumed to be produced. One leptoquark decays to a muon and a jet while the other decays to dark matter and low-p T standard model particles. The signature for signal events would be significant missing transverse momentum from the dark matter in conjunction with a peak at the leptoquark mass in the invariant mass distribution of the highest p T muon and jet. The data are observed to be consistent with the background predicted by the standard model. For the first benchmark scenario considered, dark matter masses up to 500 GeV are excluded for leptoquark masses m LQ \u2248 1400 GeV, and up to 300 GeV for m LQ \u2248 1500 GeV. For the second benchmark scenario, dark matter masses up to 600 GeV are excluded for m LQ \u2248 1400 GeV.",

Because of its presumed weakly interacting nature, a DM particle produced at the LHC would escape unobserved, manifesting itself as missing transverse momentum p miss T in the reconstructed events. The most generic signal for DM at the LHC thus consists of an excess, relative to the standard model (SM) expectation, of events with sizable p miss T recoiling against a visible SM object such as a jet, a photon, or an electroweak boson. Such searches have been conducted at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] but with no evidence, to date, for DM [15].

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, were collected by the CMS Collaboration in 2016 (35.9 fb \u22121 ) and 2017 (41.5 fb \u22121 ) at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. The coannihilation process considered arises within a general class of simplified models in which a DM particle is either annihilated or produced in conjunction with a so-called coannihilation partner, denoted \"X\". At the LHC, DM could thus be produced through a reaction like M \u2192 DM + X, where M is a mediator representing either an SM or a beyond-the-SM particle. To be consistent with the observed value of DM , the fractional mass difference X,DM \u2261 (m X \u2212 m DM )/m DM between the X and DM particles should be less than \u22480.2 [16].",

The first term in the first line describes the decay of the LQ to DM and X, with y D the coupling strength. The second and third terms of the first line represent the interactions, with coupling strengths y Q and y Lu , for the different helicity couplings to the up-type quark and the lepton. The second line describes the interactions of the lower component of the leptoquark doublet M d s , which has electric charge -2/3. In the limit that y Q = 0 and y Lu = 0, both the upper and lower components of the doublet have the same collider phenomenology. The SM decays of the upper component of the M u s doublet are to up-type quarks and leptons, while those of the lower component of the M d s doublet are to down-type quarks and leptons. In the limit that y Q = 0 and y Lu = 0, the upper and lower components of the doublet have different collider phenomenology. The SM decays of the upper component of M u s are again to up-type quarks and leptons, but the only SM decays of the lower component are to neutrinos and up-type quarks, and not to the full leptoquark signature. Both the upper and lower components of the LQ doublet have been considered in this analysis. Following the example of Ref. [16], we assume y Lu = 0. Thus it should be born in mind that the limits obtained in this analysis are valid under this explicit assumption. In the pair production of the LQ, one LQ decays to a muon and a c or an s quark, while the other decays through the coannihilation paradigm, to DM and X. The X particle subsequently decays through a crossed coannihilation process to a DM particle and an off-shell LQ, where the decay products of this latter particle, also a muon and a c or an s quark, have low transverse momentum (p T ) because of the smallness of X,DM and are potentially undetected.

Note that, in the analysis, we do not employ c quark tagging criteria but rather-to improve the signal event selection efficiency-utilize generic untagged jets as the c quark jet candidates. The existence of the signal process is inferred by a peak at the LQ mass m LQ , in the invariant mass m \u03bcj distribution of the high-p T muon and jet, in conjunction with significant p miss T from the DM. This peak at the LQ mass provides a striking experimental signature in the search for signal processes containing DM. In contrast, generic searches for DM, in which there are no new particles other than DM and intermediate mediator states, mostly rely on a mere enhancement in the tail of the p miss T distribution. The principal SM backgrounds in this search arise from events with a W boson and jets (W +jets) or with a top quark-antiquark (tt) pair: in both cases, the leptonic decay of a W boson can yield a high-p T muon and neutrino, where the neutrino can lead to significant p miss T . Events with single top quark or diboson (W W , W Z, and Z Z ) production similarly can enter the background, although at a lower level. Other smaller sources of SM background arise from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) events, namely events with a multijet final state produced exclusively through the strong interaction, and from events with a Z boson and jets ( Z +jets). A QCD event can enter the background if a muon and a neutrino are produced through the semileptonic decay of a quark, or if a jet is erroneously identified as a muon in conjunction with spurious p miss T arising from the mismeasurement of jet p T . Events with Z +jets production can enter the background if one of the leptons in Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays is not reconstructed or lies outside the acceptance of the detector, leading to p miss T , or if p miss T arises because of misreconstructed jet p T .",

The measured scale factor is in agreement within 20% with the original scale factor.

This control sample is selected by requiring two oppositely charged isolated muons with p T > 30 GeV, with a dimuon invariant mass between 80 and 100 GeV, but with other-wise similar selection criteria to those of the preselection. The Z boson candidate is boosted to its rest frame, the dimuon mass is scaled to the mass of the W boson, and the system is then boosted back to the original laboratory frame. One of the two muons is randomly removed to simulate a neutrino from W boson decay. The resulting missing momentum is added to the p miss T of the event and the value of m T recalculated before applying the signal region selection criteria. The level of agreement in the resulting distribution of m \u03bcj between data and simulation is also around 20%. On the basis of these two studies, a 20% uncertainty is assigned to the W +jets background prediction.

Thus, we evaluate the QCD background using a method based primarily on data. A control sample is defined using the signal region criteria of Section 3 except that muon candidates are required to fail the isolation condition. To estimate the QCD background in the signal region, the events in the control sample are weighted as a function of muon p T by a muon misidentification probability, called the jet-to-muon misidentification rate, determined in a QCD-enriched event sample denoted the \"low\u03c6\" sample. The low\u03c6 sample is defined in the same manner as the signal region except the angle \u03c6 between p miss T and the leading jet is required to be \u03c6 < 0.5 rather than \u03c6 > 0.5 and we require m T > 100 GeV rather than m T > 500 GeV. The jet-to-muon misidentification rate is defined, from this sample, as the ratio of the number of events that satisfy the muon relative isolation criterion I < 0.15 to the number of events with no requirement on the isolation, after subtracting the non-QCD components, evaluated with simulation, from both the numerator and denominator. The purity of QCD events in the numerator is about 25%, while that in the denominator is approximately 70%.

Uncertainties related to the top quark p T reweighting in simulated tt events are evaluated by varying the reweighting parameters between zero and twice their nominal values [54,55]. Uncertainties related to the PDFs, evaluated for the signal acceptance, are determined following the PDF4LHC prescription [67] and are found to be 3%. Those related to the renormalization and factorization scales, evaluated for the signal yields and for the tt and W +jets backgrounds, are estimated by varying each scale independently, and also coherently, by a factor of 2.0 and 0.5. The largest variations upward and downward in the results are used to define an uncertainty envelope. This uncertainty amounts to 1% for signal events, independent of the LQ mass. For the tt and W +jets backgrounds, this uncertainty varies between 5 and 15% depending on m LQ and thus accounts for a systematic uncertainty in the shape of the distribution. The uncertainty associated with the method chosen to determine the K factor for the W +jets background evaluation is estimated to be 5%. Table 1 summarizes the systematic uncertainties affecting the normalization of distributions.",

The fitted parameters are the yields of the individual background components listed in Table 2, the signal yield, and various nuisance parameters. The nuisance parameters are introduced to treat systematic uncertainties. Log-normal probability distributions are used for nuisance parameters that affect the normalizations of the signal and background yields. Gaussian probability distributions are used for nuisance parameters that affect the shape of the m \u03bcj distribution. All normalization uncertainties are taken to be fully correlated across bins except those that are statistical in origin, which are assumed to be uncorrelated. The overall postfit uncertainty in the dominant W +jets background is substantially smaller than the prefit value shown in Table 1 because the normalization and shape of this background is highly constrained by the lower side of the mass distribution. Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are determined on the product of the signal production cross section and branching fraction. These limits are calculated using a modified frequentist approach with the CL s criterion [68,69] and an asymptotic approximation for the test statistic [70,71]. The limits are determined as a function of m LQ and m DM . Fig. 4 (top) presents the results for B = 0.5. The region to the right and below the diagonal line is where LQ decay to DM and X is allowed. The solid and dashed black curves show the observed and expected exclusion limits, respectively, taking into account contributions from both upper and lower components of the LQ doublet. Combinations of m LQ and m DM to the left and below the solid curve are excluded. It can be seen that the signal scenario of Fig. 1 is excluded for values of m DM up to 500 GeV for m LQ \u2248 1400 GeV and up to 300 GeV for m LQ \u2248 1500 GeV. This is the first test of the co-annihilation process proposed in [16], thus it is not possible to make a direct comparison with other results. To give an indication of the extent to which our re-sults explore untested regions of the m LQ -m DM parameter space we have therefore performed a recast of the results from a search for pair produced second-generation LQs, each decaying to a muon and a c quark [23]. The recast is performed in two steps. In the first step, the change in the branching fraction of the LQ to a lepton and a quark is calculated once the decay of the LQ to DM and X is allowed. The change depends on the parameters of the model including X,DM , B, LQ and DM mass [16]. The altered branching fraction is then used to find the exclusion contour in the plane of m LQ and m DM . The resultant limit contour is shown as the dotted blue curve. This limit contour may be compared with the solid blue curve, which shows the observed exclusion limit that would be obtained from the present analysis if only the upper component of the LQ doublet, decaying to a muon and a c quark, contributed to the potential signal. Fig. 4 (bottom) shows results obtained assuming the somewhat smaller value of 0.1 for B. In this case, the upper limit of excluded DM mass is extended significantly, reaching a maximum of \u2248600 GeV for m LQ \u2248 1400 GeV.",

The study is conducted using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb \u22121 . It is assumed that dark matter is produced through the production of a leptoquark pair, with one leptoquark decaying to a muon and a jet, and the other to dark matter and low-p T standard model particles. The analysis is performed by searching for a peak in the leptoquark candidate invariant mass m \u03bcj distribution formed from the highest p T muon and jet in an event, with the requirement of significant missing transverse momentum, as is expected from the presence of dark matter. The observation of such a peak in this novel search would provide strong evidence for the existence of both dark matter particles and leptoquarks. The data are observed to agree with the standard model background predictions within the uncertainties. Upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction are obtained at 95% confidence level as a function of the leptoquark and dark matter particle masses. For the first benchmark scenario considered, dark matter masses up to 500 GeV are excluded for leptoquark masses m LQ \u2248 1400 GeV, and up to 300 GeV for m LQ \u2248 1500 GeV.
