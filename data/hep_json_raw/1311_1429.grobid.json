After a short reminder of the main results from lower energies, this review highlights a few selected areas where significant progress has been made during the first three years of ion operation at the LHC.",

QCD predicts that at a sufficiently high energy density there will be a transition from ordinary nuclear or hadronic matter to a plasma of free (deconfined) quarks and gluons, the 'quark-gluon plasma' (QGP). The discovery and characterization of this plasma phase is thought to require a large volume of hot/dense matter and is therefore pursued in collisions of heavy nuclei at the highest energies.",

An appraisal of the SPS program was made in 2000 [7], based on a 'common assessment' of the results from half a dozen experiments collected and published over the preceding years. It concluded that compelling evidence has been found for a new state of matter, featuring many of the characteristics expected for a QGP 1 . This conclusion was based primarily on three experimental observations: the copious production of hadrons containing a strange quark (strangeness enhancement), the yields of low mass lepton pairs (rho melting), and the reduced production of J/ mesons (anomalous J/ suppression).",

Unlike the expectation, with hindsight overly naive, that the QGP would resemble an almost ideal gas of weakly coupled quarks and gluons, the hot matter was found to behave like an extremely strongly interacting, almost perfect liquid, sometimes called the sQGP (where the 's' stand for 'strongly interacting'). It is almost opaque and absorbs much of the energy of any fast parton which travels through-a process referred to as jet quenching-and it reacts to pressure gradients by flowing almost unimpeded and with very little internal friction (i.e. has very small shear viscosity) [20,21].",

The temperature was inferred by measuring direct 'thermal' photons with an inverse slope of order 200 MeV, which leads to a (model dependent) estimate of an initial temperature of at least 300 MeV. The characterization of the QGP as almost opaque was based on the observation of a very significant suppression, up to a factor of five, of high p T particles found in central, head-on nuclear collisions. This suppression of high p T particles, which are typically leading jet fragments, is indicative of very strong final state interactions of the scattered partons with the medium, leading to significant energy loss via elastic scattering or enhanced gluon radiation. As essential control measurements, the suppression was neither seen in d-Au reactions, therefore excluding cold nuclear matter effects as the cause, nor with colour neutral probes like direct photons, which clearly establishes the effect as due to the strong (=QCD) interaction in the final state.",

            "text": "Prior to LHC, 25 years of heavy ion experimentation had already revealed a 'QGP-like' state at the SPS and not 'the QGP', but 'a sQGP' at RHIC. One could consider the discovery phase for the QGP as essentially over, the qualitative characterization as well under way, and quantitative precision measurements of QGP properties as just having started [22]. A main goal for the heavy ion program at LHC was therefore to measure with increased precision the parameters which characterize this new state of matter, making use of the particular strength of the LHC: a powerful new generation of large acceptance state-of-the-art experiments ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb 3 , and a huge increase in beam energy with the associated larger cross sections for hard probes and higher particle density, which makes for a QGP which will be 'hotter, larger and longer living'. And indeed, LHC made significant progress towards increasing the precision on shear viscosity (see section 4) and plasma opacity (section 5) already during the first two years of ion running. However, when dealing with QCD in the nonperturbative regime, surprises should not come as a surprise, and a number of unexpected findings at LHC have helped shed new light on some old problems or issues. Two of those will be mentioned below, relating to particle production (i.e. thermalization, section 2) and quarkonia suppression (i.e. deconfinement, section 3). And finally the very first discovery made at LHC is discussed in section 5: the appearance of a mysterious long range 'ridge' correlation in high multiplicity pp reactions. It reappeared later-and much stronger-in the 2012 p-nucleus run, making it of great interest, and presumably of great relevance, to hot and dense matter physics, even if it is ultimate cause and connection to similar phenomena in nuclear collisions is as of today not finally settled.",

            "text": "The production of different hadronic particle species in high energy collisions is a nonperturbative process and in general parameterized in phenomenological models and event generators, requiring usually a large number of parameters. A rather more economical approach is the thermal/statistical model of hadronization [8][9][10][11][12], which assumes that particles are created in thermal (or phase space) equilibrium; particles of mass m are essentially suppressed by a Boltzmann factor e \u2212m/T . In its simplest implementation, the scale parameter T, identified as the chemical freeze-out temperature, is the only free parameter of the model and defines the production of all hadronic species, together with some conservation laws (baryons, strangeness, etc) and an overall normalization constant proportional to the total particle multiplicity. For small systems (small number of final state hadrons), an additional parameter \u03b3 s (or, equivalently, a reduced correlation volume) has to be introduced to describe the fact that strange hadrons are suppressed compared to the grand canonical thermal expectation. The temperature parameter T is found in all high energy collisions ( pp, e + e \u2212 , A A) to be about 160 MeV, while \u03b3 s increases from 0.5 \u2212 0.7 in pp to 0.9 \u2212 1 in A A. The fact that most hadrons containing light and strange quarks are described by the thermal model with typically better than 10-20% precision was considered an essential and well established fact in heavy ion collisions.",

One of two qualitative mechanisms are usually invoked which can be summarized as (i) born into (phase space) equilibrium or (ii) evolving into (thermal) equilibrium [11,23,24]. The former (i) could arise for example from Fermi's golden rule, the fact that reaction rates are proportional in this case to the product of a QCD matrix element and a hadronic final state phase space factor. As many different channels (matrix elements) contribute to particle yields, phase space dominates in inclusive measurements and the most conspicuous QCD remnant is the observed suppression (\u03b3 s < 1) of strange particles in elementary reactions ( pp, e + e \u2212 ), reflecting the higher mass of the strange quark and local strangeness conservation. This strangeness suppression is then 'somehow' lifted in large systems (A A), effectively replacing local strangeness conservation by average global (grand canonical) conservation. The alternative explanation (ii) postulates that inelastic reactions either in the partonic phase or in the final state hadronic phase drive initial abundances quickly towards thermal equilibrium via detailed balance. Reaction rates, in particular those involving more than two initial state hadrons, decrease drastically with temperature and therefore inelastic reactions seize abruptly when the system expands and cools, preserving chemical equilibrium ratios and a freeze-out temperature still very close to the hadronization transition.",

Some experimental observations are also counterintuitive: if hadronization is sudden, from an equilibrated partonic phase (the sQGP) with little inelastic hadronic final state interactions, the particle ratios should reflect parton equilibrium, which in general would result in particle fractions very different from hadron equilibrium. If, on the contrary, particle yields are established via hadronic reactions, a common chemical freeze-out of all particle species seems a priori unlikely. One should expect to see at least some indications for sequential freeze-out, where hadrons with large inelastic cross section stay longer in equilibrium and freeze out later (at lower temperature) than those with significantly smaller reaction cross sections.",

Standard one parameter thermal fits (i) give a somewhat poor description of measured particle ratios and return a chemical freeze-out temperature T significantly below the one extracted previously from RHIC (by 6-10 MeV) [27]. Even if one accepts the LHC fits as tolerable and within the range of accuracy of the thermal model, the question why and how the chemical freeze-out temperature would come down with increasing energy remains open. Sequential models (ii) try to estimate abundance changes from inelastic hadronic final state interactions after initial chemical freeze-out [28]. In any thermally evolving system, sequential (time and temperature ordered) freeze-out of different degrees of freedom with different cross sections and mean free paths must exist at some level; the question is one of magnitude rather than of principle. Some nonequilibrium calculations, usually done with the help of event generators or kinetic transport models, give results remarkably close to the LHC data and also improve thermal model fits at lower energies, making this mechanism a plausible explanation. However, given the multitude of unknown hadronic reaction cross sections which are needed in the final state rescattering calculations, as well as the need to consider multiprong initial states to satisfy detailed balance requirements, make these calculations more of an art than an exact science and the arguments qualitative rather than quantitative ones. Finally (iii), extensions to the standard model [29], where nonequilibrium thermodynamics (including supercooling below the phase transition) is applied to the parton rather than to the hadron phase, can well fit all currently available data, albeit at the expense of two additional free parameters.",

A possible explanation was that the directly produced J/\u03c8 is not suppressed at all, neither at SPS nor at RHIC, and only the high mass charmonium states \u03c8' and \u03c7 c , which populate about 40% of the observed J/\u03c8 yield, are affected by the medium.

Matter properties like the equation of state, sound velocity or shear viscosity, can be extracted by comparing measurements and hydrodynamic model calculations of elliptic (i.e. azimuth dependent) and radial (azimuthally averaged) flow. Flow depends not only on matter properties but also on initial conditions, in particular the geometrical distribution of energy density within the nuclear overlap zone and the resulting pressure gradients. In general the nuclear impact parameter, and therefore the reaction zone geometry relevant for initial conditions, can be measured rather well event-by-event for each individual collision, using global event observables like particle multiplicity or forward 'zero degree' energy. However, the remaining model dependence of the energy density profile is sufficiently large to dominate the systematic errors and limit the accuracy with which the matter parameters can be extracted from the data. Before LHC turn-on, the defining property of the 'perfect liquid', the shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio \u03b7/s, was only known to be within a factor of about five to the conjectured quantum limit 1/4\u03c0.",

Higher order components were thought to be small or vanish for symmetry reasons.

The analysis of flow has been invigorated and is advancing rapidly ever since, with direct measurements of the fluctuation spectrum [36], using event-by-event measurement and selection of flow as an analysis tool [37], and even finding nonlinear mode mixing between different harmonics [38]. Like temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, which can be mapped to initial state density fluctuations in the early Universe, collective flow fluctuations strongly constrain the initial conditions (initial density distributions) and therefore allows a better measurement of fluid properties. Since 2011, the limit for the shear viscosity has come down by a factor of two (\u03b7/s smaller than two to three times 1/4\u03c0). It is now precise enough to see a hint of a temperature dependence (slightly increasing from RHIC to LHC) [3], and future improvements in data accuracy and hydro modelling should either further improve the limit, or give a finite value for \u03b7/s. In either case, improved precision is relevant as the shear viscosity is directly related to the in-medium cross section and therefore contains information about the degrees of freedom relevant in the sQGP via the strength and temperature dependence of their interactions.",

In addition, E also depends on the parton type via the colour charge (quark versus gluon), the parton mass via formation time and interference effects (light versus heavy quarks), and finally somewhat on the jet energy. The total jet energy is of course conserved and the energy lost by the leading parton appears mostly in the radiated gluons, leading in effect to a medium modified softer fragmentation function.

The two jets remain essentially back-to-back (little or no angular broadening relative to pp) and the radiated energy ( E) is found in very low p T particles (<2 GeV/c) and at large angles to the jet direction [41]. The latter two findings were initially a surprise, but are now incorporated naturally into models where the energy is lost in multiple, soft scatterings, and the radiated gluons are emitted at large angles.

While in the meantime far eclipsed by the discovery of 'a Higgs-like particle', this 'near side ridge' is arguably still the most unexpected LHC discovery to date and spawned a large variety of different explanations, from mildly speculative to outright weird [45]. The most serious contenders are saturation physics, as formulated in the colour glass condensate model (CGC), and collective hydrodynamic flow. Hydrodynamics is of course a very successful framework to describe long range correlations in the macroscopic hot matter created in heavy ion reactions, but was not supposed to be applicable in small systems like pp collisions, where typically only a few, or at most a few ten, particles are produced per unit of rapidity. The CGC is a 'first principles' classical field theory approximation to QCD which is applicable to very dense (high occupation number) parton systems like those found at small-x and small Q 2 in the initial state wave function of hadrons. It has been successfully used to describe some regularities seen e.g. in ep collisions at HERA (geometric scaling) and to model the initial conditions in heavy ion physics.",

The correlation strength was actually significantly stronger than in pp at the same multiplicity, and in quick succession it was discovered that: the ridge was actually double-sided, showing correlations between particles both close by in azimuth as well as back-to-back; a Fourier analysis revealed both even (v 2 ) as well as odd (v 3 ) component; the correlation strength measured with four particles was almost identical to the one measured with two, indicating strongly a collective or at least multi-particle origin; and finally the dependence of the correlation strength on particle mass was virtually identical to the one expected from hydrodynamic flow.",

However, the idea of having small sQGP fireballs created even in pp collisions at the LHC may be less radical than it seems on first sight. At high energy, a proton is qualitatively similar to a small nucleus in some respect; an extended, finite size collection of many (sea)partons which can undergo simultaneous and independent scatterings (called multi-parton interactions in pp, and N coll in AA). Also the final state energy-or particle density (particles per unit volume) in high multiplicity pp is comparable to or even larger than in central Pb-Pb. The thermalization time scale commonly assumed for the sQGP created in nuclear collisions is significantly less than 1 fm c \u22121 [3]; therefore the local volume required for thermalization is presumably of comparable size, i.e. at most a few fm 3 ! Once equilibrated, the limit on \u03b7/s implies that the mean free path in the sQGP is compatible with zero or the Compton wavelength. We do find higher harmonic flow components which originate from density fluctuations with scales of order 1 fm or less. There is therefore actually quite some direct and indirect evidence that in matter with initial energy densities like those produced in high multiplicity pp and p A (and, of course, A A), the 1 fm scale is big enough (and long lived enough) to approach thermal equilibrium and exhibit collective phenomena. The applicability of hydro does not depend on absolute scales (fm or km), but on dimensionless numbers, and e.g. the ratio of system size over mean free path is a big number even in a small (but extremely dense) system like high multiplicity pp!",

            "text": "As shown in selected examples above, results have come fast and on a wide range of topics for heavy ion physics during the first three years of LHC Run-1: from subtle, as yet to be fully digested hints (particle ratios) to rather suggestive and clear messages (J/\u03c8 recombination), the LHC has been shining a new and very instructive light on old problems. Some properties of the sQGP have been measured with significantly better precision (\u03b7/s, opacity), improving along the way substantially our understanding of the underlying mechanism (jet quenching) or even leading to a paradigm shift (higher harmonic flow) which opened a vast new range of observables to precision experiment and precision theory. And if the strong suspicion that the surprising long range structures in pp and p A collisions are of collective hydro origin turns out to be correct, the 'new state of matter' will have once more shown that ' .. it is a state quite different and even more remarkable than had been predicted.' Some of the main experimental issues which can be addressed with nuclear beams in the upcoming runs at full LHC energy on the short to medium term are fairly clear based on the current results: one could hope to largely complete the measurements needed for understanding quarkonia production as a deconfinement signal and QGP thermometer. This includes quantifying 'other effects' from the past (and probably a future, high luminosity) p A run, and reducing the statistical error in particular for the higher mass members of the J/ and \u03d2 families as well as midrapidity low p T J/\u03c8. Precision and sophistication in the flow analysis should further improve over the coming years, on both experimental and theory fronts, hopefully reaching a precision in e.g. \u03b7/s of order 30% or better, at which point the result would be precise enough for quantum corrections to the AdS/CFT lower bound to become relevant. While this is definitely a long shot, its worth aiming at because there are not many alternatives on the horizon for experimental tests of quantum string theory. And last, not least, the 'ridge puzzle' may be solved quite soon-e.g. using multi-particle methods to rigorously (dis)prove collectivity-to decide between initial state (CGC) or final state (hydro) origin. If the correlation signal turns out to be the smoking gun for saturation physics, yet another new state of matter will have been discovered at the LHC; a dense, cold, quasi-classical state of gluon matter. And even if hydro is the answer, the search should go on in p A for any other sign of saturation physics. In particular in the forward direction at very low Feynman x (right in the LHCb acceptance), the conditions for saturation phenomena should be just right and proton-nucleus collisions will be the best place to look for them for some time, until an electron-ion collider comes into operation. If in fact a sensitive experimental search for the saturation physics will be carried out at the LHC, the results certainly can make, and possibly could break, the science case for such a future machine.",

            "text": "On a more than 10 year medium-to long-term time scale, which includes experimental and machine upgrades with better detectors and higher luminosity, a comprehensive program can take place to precisely measure and test the various aspects of jet quenching, including e.g. fragmentation functions with the golden \u03b3 -jet channel and precision heavy quark measurements down to zero momentum. On this time scale one hopefully can also address signals sensitive to chiral symmetry restoration (e.g. low mass lepton pairs); a defining property of the QGP which is experimentally extremely challenging and has therefore received comparatively less attention.",

            "text": "The exploration of the phases of strongly interacting matter is one of the four main pillars of contemporary nuclear physics, and one should see the LHC ion program in this broader context: the RHIC program is very active and competitive and continues to map the phase diagram at lower temperatures, in addition looking via an energy scan for the transition between normal matter and the sQGP and a 'tri-critical' point somewhere in the region at or below SPS fixed target energy. A continuation and strengthening of the SPS fixed target program is under discussion and two new low energy facilities (FAIR at GSI and NICA at JINR) are being built to study compressed matter, i.e. matter at high baryon density and (comparatively) low temperature where the phase structure may be quite different (first order phase transition) and the matter is closer related to neutron stars than to the early universe. The LHC however is and will be the energy frontier facility not only of high energy physics but also of nuclear physics for the foreseeable future, with a well-defined and extensive program and wish list of measurements. And if the first three years are any guide, strong interaction physics, while firmly rooted in the Standard Model, shows no end to surprises and discoveries and promises to keep physics with heavy ions at the LHC interesting (and fun) for quite some time to come.",
