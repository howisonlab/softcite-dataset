We use the strong D \u22c6+ \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decay (\"D \u22c6 tag\") to identify the flavor of the charmed meson at production time and exploit CP -conserving strong cc pair-production in pp collisions. Higher statistic samples of Cabibbo-favored D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays with and without D \u22c6 tag are used to highly suppress systematic uncertainties due to detector effects. The result, A CP (D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) =\u02c60.22 \u00b1 0.24 (stat.) \u00b1 0.11 (syst.)\u02dc%, is the world's most precise measurement to date and it is fully consistent with no CP violation.",

The integration in eq. (2) is performed over the observed distribution of proper decay time, D(t). Since the value of t depends strongly on D(t), different values of A CP could be observed in different experimental environments because of different sensitivities to a dir CP or a ind CP . Since the trigger used in this analysis imposes requirements on minimum impact parameters of the D 0 decay particles, our sample is enriched of higher-valued proper decay time candidates with respect to B-factory experiments.

The observed asymmetry include a possible tiny contribution from actual CP violation, diluted in much larger effects from instrumental charge-asymmetries. Indeed the layout of the main tracker detector, the drift chamber, is intrinsically charge asymmetric due to a 35 \u2022 tilt angle of the cells from the radial direction 2 , thus different detection efficiencies for positive and negative low-momentum tracks induce an instrumental asymmetry in the number of reconstructed D \u22c6 -tagged D 0 and D 0 mesons.

We extract independent signal yields for D 0 and D 0 candidates without using particle identification in the analysis. In the two D \u22c6 -tagged samples this is done using the charge of the soft pion. In the untagged D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + sample we randomly divided the sample in two indipendent subsamples similar in size. In each subsample we calculate the mass of each candidate with a specific mass assignments: K \u2212 \u03c0 + in the first subsample and K + \u03c0 \u2212 in the second one. Thus in one sample the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + signal is correctly reconstructed and appears as a narrow peak, overlapping a broader peak of the misreconstructed D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 component. The viceversa applies the other sample. The raw asymmetry is extracted by fitting the number of candidates populating the two narrow peaks. We determine the yields by performing a binned fit to the D 0 \u03c0 s -mass (K\u03c0-mass) distribution combining positive and negative decays of both tagged (untagged) samples. The resulting raw asymmetries are: A raw CP (\u03c0\u03c0 \u22c6 ) = (\u22121.86 \u00b1 0.23)%, A raw CP (K\u03c0 \u22c6 ) = (\u22122.91 \u00b1 0.05)%, A raw CP (K\u03c0) = (\u22120.83 \u00b1 0.03)%. The analysis technique has been extensively tested on Monte Carlo simulation using samples simulated with a wide range of physical and detector asymmetries to verify that the cancellation works regardless of the specific configuration. These studies confirm the validity of our approach and provide a quantitative estimate of possible asymmetries induced by higher order detector effect that may not get fully cancelled or effects of not factorization of K\u03c0 and \u03c0 s reconstruction efficiencies. This upper limit is used as systematic uncertainty and amount to 0.009%.",

In most cases, this implied varying slightly the shape of the functional forms used in fits, repeating the fit on data, and using the difference between the results of these and the central fit as a systematic uncertainty. This overestimate the size of the systematic effects because it introduces an additional statistical source of fluctuation in the results. But we can comfortably afford that given the large event samples size involved. The dominant contributions to the systematic uncertainties on the asymmetry measurement come from the uncertainty on the differences in charge of the mass shapes, and the uncertainty due to the contamination by charm mesons produced in b-hadron decays (CP-violating asymmetries in B decays induce an asymmetric source of charm and anti-charm mesons). We obtain a total systematic uncertainty on our final A CP (\u03c0\u03c0) measurement of 0.11%, approximately half of the statistical uncertainty.",
