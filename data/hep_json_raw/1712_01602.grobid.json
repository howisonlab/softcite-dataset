The cross-section for each of these chane-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch nels depends on the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb and form factor f L V [1][2][3] such that the cross-section is proportional to | f L V V tb | 2 [4,5], i.e. depends on the coupling between the W boson, top and b quarks. The t W channel, represented in Fig. 1, has a pp production cross-section at \u221a s = 13 TeV of \u03c3 theory = 71.7 \u00b1 1.8 (scale) \u00b1 3.4 (PDF) pb [6], and contributes approximately 24% of the total single-top-quark production rate at 13 TeV. At the LHC, evidence for this process with 7 TeV collision data was presented by the ATLAS Collaboration [7] (with a significance of 3.6\u03c3 ), and by the CMS Collaboration [8] (with a significance of 4.0\u03c3 ). With 8 TeV collision data, CMS observed the t W channel with a significance of 6.1\u03c3 [9] while ATLAS observed it with a significance of 7.7\u03c3 [10]. This analysis extends an ATLAS analysis [11] which measured the production cross-section with 13 TeV data collected in 2015.",

A fully consistent theoretical picture can be reached by considering t W and tt to be components of the complete W bW b final state in the four flavour scheme [12]. In the tt process the two W b systems are produced on the top quark mass shell, and so a proper treatment of this doubly resonant component is important in the study of t W beyond leading order. Two commonly used approaches are diagram removal (DR) and diagram subtraction (DS) [13]. In the DR approach, all next-to-leading order (NLO) diagrams that overlap with the doubly resonant tt contributions are removed from the calculation of the t W amplitude, violating gauge invariance. In the DS approach, a subtraction term is built into the amplitude to cancel out the tt component close to the top quark resonance while respecting gauge invariance.",

This channel is chosen because it has a better ratio of signal and tt production over other background processes than the single lepton+jets channel, where large W +jets backgrounds are relatively difficult to separate from top quark events. Distributions are unfolded to observables based on stable particles produced in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Measurements are performed in a fiducial phase space, defined by the presence of two charged leptons as well as the presence of exactly one central jet containing b-hadrons (b-jet) and no other jets. This requirement on the jet multiplicity is expected to suppress the contribution from tt production, where a pair of b-jets is more commonly produced, as well as reducing the importance of tt-t W interference effects [12]. After applying the reconstruction-level selection of fiducial events (described in Sect. 5) backgrounds from tt and other sources are subtracted according to their predicted distributions from MC simulation. The definition of the fiducial event selection is chosen to match the lepton and jet requirements at reconstruction level. Exactly two leptons with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 are required, and at least one of the leptons must satisfy p T > 27 GeV. Exactly one b-tagged jet satisfying p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 must be present. No requirement is placed on E miss T or m . A boosted decision tree (BDT) is used to separate the t W signal from the large tt background by placing a fixed requirement on the BDT response.",

Particle energies and masses are also preferred to projections onto the transverse plane in order to be sensitive to polar angular information while keeping the list of observables as short as possible. Unfolded distributions are measured for: The top quark production is probed most directly by E(b), the only final-state object that can unambiguously be matched to the decay products of the top quark. The top-quark decay is probed by m( 1 b) and m( 2 b), which are sensitive to angular correlations of decay products due to production spin correlations. The combined t W -system is probed by E( b), m T ( \u03bd\u03bdb), and m( b). At reconstruction level, the transverse momenta of the neutrinos in m T ( \u03bd\u03bdb) are represented by the measured E miss T (reconstructed as described in Sect. 4). At particle level the vector summed transverse momenta of simulated neutrinos (selected as defined in Sect. 4) are used in m T ( \u03bd\u03bdb). All other quantities for leptons and jets are taken simply from the relevant reconstructed or particlelevel objects. These observables are selected to minimise the bias introduced by the BDT requirement, as certain observables are highly correlated with the BDT discriminant. These cannot be effectively unfolded due to shaping effects that the BDT requirement imposes on the overall acceptance, and thus are not considered in this measurement. The background-subtracted data are unfolded using an iterative procedure [14] to correct for resolution and acceptance effects, biases, and particles outside the fiducial phase space of the measurement. The differential cross-sections are normalised with the fiducial cross-section, which cancels out many of the largest uncertainties.",

An alternative t W sample was generated using the DS scheme instead of DR. A t W sample generated with Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [35] (instead of the Powheg-Box) interfaced with Herwig++ 2.7.1 [36] and processed through the Atlfast2 fast simulation is used to estimate uncertainties associated with the modelling of the NLO matrix-element event generator. A sample generated with Powheg-Box interfaced with Herwig++ (instead of Pythia 6) is used to estimate uncertainties associated with the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying-event models. This sample is also compared with the previously mentioned MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample to estimate a matrix-element event generator uncertainty with a consistent parton shower event generator. In both cases, the UE-EE-5 tune of Ref. [37] was used for the underlying event. Finally, in order to estimate uncertainties arising from additional QCD radiation in the t W events, a pair of samples were generated with Powheg-Box interfaced with Pythia 6 using Atl-fast2 and the P2012 tune with higher and lower radiation relative to the nominal set, together with varied renormalisation and factorisation scales. In order to avoid comparing two different detector response models when estimating systematic uncertainties, another version of the nominal Powheg-Box with Pythia 6 sample was also produced with Atl-fast2.",

Like the additional t W samples, these are used to estimate the uncertainties associated with the matrixelement event generator (a sample produced using Atlfast2 fast simulation with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.2 interfaced with Herwig++ 2.7.1), parton shower and hadronisation models (a sample produced using Atlfast2 with Powheg-Box interfaced with Herwig++ 2.7.1) and additional QCD radiation. To estimate uncertainties on additional QCD radiation in tt, a pair of samples is produced using full simulation with the varied sets of P2012 parameters for higher and lower radiation, as well as with varied renormalisation and factorisation scales. In these samples the resummation damping factor h damp is doubled in the case of higher radiation. The tt cross-section is set to \u03c3 tt = 831.8 +19.8 \u221229.2 (scale) \u00b1 35.1 (PDF + \u03b1 S ) pb as calculated with the Top++ 2.0 program to NNLO, including soft-gluon resummation to NNLL [38]. The first uncertainty comes from the independent variation of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, \u03bc F and \u03bc R , while the second one is associated with variations in the PDF and \u03b1 S , following the PDF4LHC prescription with the MSTW2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN PDF sets [39][40][41][42]. Samples used to model the Z + jets background [43] were simulated with Sherpa 2.2.1 [44]. In these, the matrix element is calculated for up to two partons at NLO and four partons at LO using Comix [45] and OpenLoops [46], and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [47] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [48]. The NNPDF3.0 NNLO PDF set [49] was used in conjunction with Sherpa parton shower tuning, with a generator-level cut-off on the dilepton invariant mass of m > 40 GeV applied. The Z + jets events are normalised using NNLO cross-sections computed with FEWZ [50].",

In this analysis, the BDT implementation is provided by the TMVA package [66], using the GradientBoost algorithm. The approach is based on the BDT developed for the inclusive cross-section measurement in Ref. [11]. The BDT is optimised by using the sum of the nominal t W MC sample, the alternative t W MC sample with the diagram subtraction scheme and the nominal tt MC sample; for each sample, half of the events are used for training while the other half is reserved for testing. A large list of variables is prepared to serve as inputs to the BDT. An optimisation procedure is then carried out to select a subset of input variables and a set of BDT parameters (such as the number of trees in the ensemble and the maximum depth of the individual decision trees). The optimisation is designed to provide the best separation between the t W signal and the tt background while avoiding sensitivity to statistical fluctuations in the training sample.",

The main uncertainties are due to the NLO matrix-element (ME) event generator, parton shower and hadronisation event generator, radiation tuning and scale choice and the PDF. The NLO matrix-element uncertainty is estimated by comparing two NLO matching methods: the predictions of Powheg-Box and Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO, both interfaced with Herwig++. The parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying-event model uncertainty is estimated by comparing Powheg-Box interfaced with either Pythia 6 or Herwig++. The uncertainty from the matrix-element event generator is treated as uncor- related between the t W and tt processes, while the uncertainty from the parton shower event generator is treated as correlated. The radiation tuning and scale choice uncertainty is estimated by taking half of the difference between samples with Powheg-Box interfaced with Pythia 6 tuned with either more or less radiation, and is uncorrelated between the t W and tt processes. These choices of correlations are based on Ref. [11], and were checked to be no less conservative than the alternative options. The choice of scheme to account for the interference between the t W and tt processes constitutes another source of systematic uncertainty for the signal modelling, and it is estimated by comparing samples using either the diagram removal scheme or the diagram subtraction scheme, both gener-ated with Powheg-Box+Pythia 6. The uncertainty due to the choice of PDF is estimated using the PDF4LHC15 combined PDF set [70]. The difference between the central CT10 [31] prediction and the central PDF4LHC15 prediction (PDF central value) is taken and symmetrised together with the internal uncertainty set provided with PDF4LHC15. Additional normalisation uncertainties are applied to each background. A 100% uncertainty is applied to the normalisation of the background from non-prompt and fake leptons, an uncertainty of 50% is applied to the Z + jets background, and a 25% normalisation uncertainty is assigned to diboson backgrounds. These uncertainties are based on earlier ATLAS studies of background simulation in top   Uncertainties due to the size of the MC samples are estimated using pseudoexperiments. An ensemble of pseudodata is created by fluctuating the MC samples within the statistical uncertainties. Each set of pseudodata is used to construct M i j , C eff i , and C oof j , and the nominal MC sample is unfolded. The width of the distribution of unfolded values from this ensemble is taken as the statistical uncertainty. Additional non-closure uncertainties are added in certain cases after stress-testing the unfolding procedure with injected Gaussian or linear functions. Each distribution is tested by reweighting the input MC sample according to the injected function, unfolding, and checking that the weights are recovered in the unfolded distribution. The extent to which the unfolded weighted data are biased with respect to the underlying weighted generator-level distribution is taken as the unfolding non-closure uncertainty.",

In general, most of the MC models show fair agreement with the measured cross-sections, with no particularly low p values observed. Notably, for each distribution there is a substantial negative slope in the ratio of predicted to observed cross-sections, indicating there are more events with high-momentum final-state objects than several of the MC models predict. This effect is most visible in the E( b) distribution, where the lower p values for all MC predictions reflect this. In most cases, differences between the MC predictions are smaller than the uncertainty on the data, but there are some signs that Powheg-Box+Herwig++ deviates more from the data and from the other predictions in certain bins of the E( b), m( b), and m( 1 b) distributions. The predictions of DS and DR samples likewise give very similar results for all observables as expected from the fiducial selection. The predictions of Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 with varied initial-and final-state radiation tuning were also examined but not found to give significantly different distributions in the fiducial phase space of this analysis. Both the statistical and systematic uncertainties have a significant impact on the result. The exact composition varies bin-to-bin but there is no single source of uncertainty that dominates each normalised measurement. Some of the largest systematic uncertainties are those related to tt and t W modelling. The cancellation in the normalised differential cross-sections is very effective at reducing a number of systematic uncertainties. The most notable cancellation is related to the tt parton shower model uncertainty, which is quite dominant prior to dividing by the fiducial cross-section.",

The measurements are performed using 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data with \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Cross-sections are measured in a fiducial phase space defined by the presence of two charged leptons and exactly one jet identified as containing b-hadrons. Six observables are chosen, constructed from the masses and energies of lep-tons and jets as well as the transverse momenta of neutrinos. Measurements are normalised with the fiducial cross-section, causing several of the main uncertainties to cancel out. Dominant uncertainties arise from limited data statistics, signal modelling, and tt background modelling. Results are found to be in good agreement with predictions from several MC event generators.",

Events with different-flavour leptons contain backgrounds from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , and are required to have E miss T > 20 GeV, with the requirement raised to E miss T > 50 GeV when the dilepton invariant mass satisfies m < 80 GeV. All events with same-flavour leptons, which contain backgrounds from Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc, must satisfy E miss T > 40 GeV. For same-flavour leptons, the Z + jets background is concentrated in a region of the m -E miss T plane corresponding to values of m near the Z mass, and towards low values of E miss T . Therefore, a selection in E miss T and m is used to remove these backgrounds: events with 40 GeV < m < 81 GeV are required to satisfy E miss T > 1.25 \u00d7 m while events with m > 101 GeV are required to satisfy E miss T > 300 GeV \u2212 2 \u00d7 m .Finally, events are required to have exactly one jet which is b-tagged. For validation of the signal and background models, additional regions are also defined according to the number of jets and the number of b-tagged jets, but are not used in the differential cross-section measurement, primarily due to the lower signal purity in these regions. These regions are labelled by the number n of selected jets and the number m of selected b-tagged jets as njmb (for example the 2j1b region consists of events with 2 selected jets of which 1 is b-tagged), and show good agreement between data and predictions.
