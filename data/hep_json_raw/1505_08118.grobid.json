The search is performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The number of observed events is found to be in agreement with the standard model predictions. The 95% confidence level upper limit on the product of the cross section and branching fraction is obtained as a function of the \u0398 0 mass. The 95% confidence level lower bounds on the \u0398 0 mass are found to be 623 and 426 GeV, for two different octo-triplet theoretical scenarios. These are the first direct experimental bounds on particles predicted by the octo-triplet model.",

            "text": "The CERN LHC is well suited to searches for new colored particles. These searches have targeted particles including vector-like quarks (color triplet spin-1/2 particles), colorons (color octet spin-1 particles), gluinos (color octet Majorana fermions), and color-octet weaksinglet scalars [1][2][3][4][5][6]. With the recent discovery of a Higgs boson [7][8][9], so far consistent with being a neutral scalar colorless particle [10,11], it is also interesting to look for additional scalars, in this case with color charge, with masses close to the electroweak scale. Particles with this combination of spin, charge, and color quantum numbers have not been thoroughly sought at collider experiments. Neutral color-octet spin-0 particles (\u0398 0 ), for example, emerge in the octo-triplet model [12], which includes three particles (\u0398 + , \u0398 0 , \u0398 \u2212 ) that transform as a color octet and weak triplet under SU(3) c \u00d7 SU(2) W . The \u0398 0 may arise from the sector responsible for breaking extended gauge symmetry associated with colorons [13][14][15]. Octo-triplets may also be fermion-antifermion bound states [16,17], or elementary particles from non-minimal grand unified theory. To date, no direct experimental bound has been set for particles predicted by the octo-triplet model.",

These heavy vector-like quarks appear in many extensions of the SM, such as composite Higgs models [18] and little Higgs models [19].

Figure 2 shows the values of the cross section in the 2-dimensional plane of G mass (m G ) and \u0398 0 mass (m \u0398 0 ). The masses of \u0398 0 , G , and \u03c6 I are free parameters in general, but we use m \u03c6 I = 125 GeV + m \u0398 0 /3 as a benchmark. We explore two distinct mass scenarios: m G = 2.3m \u0398 0 and m G = 5m \u0398 0 . The first example corresponds to a scenario in which the signal cross section is enhanced because of the additional contributions from colorons (see figure 2), while the second relation corresponds to a scenario in which the contribution from colorons is negligible. For both mass relations we use \u0398 0 masses, ranging from 200 to 900 GeV, which are large enough to allow \u0398 0 decay to on-shell Z bosons, but small enough to be within the sensitivity of this search. The first mass relation, m G = 2.3m \u0398 0 , results in \u0398 0 pair production cross sections from 125 pb down to 2.23\u00d710 \u22122 pb, for the range of \u0398 0 masses considered. This mass relation also sets JHEP09 (2015)201the G mass sufficiently above \u0398 0 pair production threshold, but small enough compared to m \u0398 0 that production through G is considerable, at 49 to 86% of the total, depending on m \u0398 0 . In this case, quark-antiquark annihilation dominates, while gluon-gluon interaction production decreases with increasing \u0398 0 (and G ) mass, because of the differences in the parton distribution functions (PDF) of quarks and gluons [21]. The second mass relation considered, m G = 5m \u0398 0 , results in \u0398 0 pair production cross sections from 63.3 pb down to 2.62\u00d710 \u22123 pb, for the range of \u0398 0 masses considered, which are a factor of two smaller than for the first mass relation. This corresponds to a region where gluon-gluon interactions dominate and production through G is just 0.6 to 3.6% of the total, depending on the \u0398 0 mass. The cross sections discussed above agree with those calculated in ref. [22] where a similar model is considered.",

However, in the Lagrangian, the coefficients of these modes turn out to be much smaller than one. This feature motivates consideration of other decay modes, which can be represented by higherdimensional operators, and therefore are usually considered as negligible with respect to dominant decay modes. In particular, qq decay modes could be as large as the electroweak boson plus gluon modes [12]. In the \u0398 0 mass range we consider, the dominant fermion decay mode is either bb or tt depending on the values of coefficients appearing in different terms of the \u0398 0 \u2192 qq Lagrangian. As a benchmark, we assign half of the branching fraction to \u0398 0 \u2192 bb, leaving the other half to the \u0398 0 \u2192 Zg and \u0398 0 \u2192 \u03b3g decay modes (i.e. B(\u0398 0 \u2192 tt) = 0). The ratio of branching fractions B(\u0398 0 \u2192 Zg)/B(\u0398 0 \u2192 \u03b3g) is set by the mass of the \u0398 0 . For the range of \u0398 0 masses explored, B(\u0398 0 \u2192 Zg) is to 38% and B(\u0398 0 \u2192 \u03b3g) accounts for the remaining to 17%.

In this analysis, we consider only opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs, and thus the data containing like-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs can be used as a control sample to determine the size of the contribution from multijet events. After the Z boson mass window selection and the requirement of at least three jets, with at least two of them being b tagged, and after subtracting events from all other simulated background processes, 27 (13) dielectron (dimuon) events are left in the like-sign dilepton channel. This corresponds to 1.6% (0.7%) of the number of opposite-sign dilepton events. These events are distributed mostly in the lower mass region, as is the case for other backgrounds.
