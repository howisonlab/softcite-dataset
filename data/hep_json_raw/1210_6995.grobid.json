At intermediate p T (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8) GeV/c) hadrons can be produced not only by fragmentation but also by quark recombination. It allows us to learn how the medium affects the particle composition [1]. In Section 2 we describe the analysis to measure the production of \u03c0/K/p as a function of p T (3-20 GeV/c). The discussion of the results and conclusions are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.",

The means and sigmas were constrained using the aforementioned parametrization and the p T spectra obtained via factorization, as described in [3]. 1 A list of members of the ALICE Collaboration and acknowledgements can be found at the end of this issue. The main source of systematic uncertainty comes from the estimation of the parameters of the fitted functions. A range of variation for those parameters was evaluated running the analysis without exploiting the information from topological and TOF PID. The parameters were randomly varied in the estimated ranges, then the yields were extracted using the same algorithm as in data. At high p T (> 10 GeV/c) the systematic uncertainties were 5%, 10% and \u223c 30 \u2212 40% for \u03c0, K and p, respectively. Also, we added the systematic errors from the spectra of inclusive charged particles [4]. 2.76 TeV. For completeness the lower p T results are also displayed for Pb \u2212 Pb [5,6]. At intermediate p T the ratio is enhanced, this phenomenon was first observed at RHIC [7]. The maximum is located at 3 GeV/c and reaches \u223c 0.8 (\u223c 0.4) for the most central (peripheral) events. For higher p T (> 8 GeV/c), the ratio is consistent with fragmentation in vacuum. Figure 2 shows a comparison with the ratio in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. It is interesting that even the pp data exhibit a maximum in the same p T region as observed in Pb \u2212 Pb collisions. ALICE previously reported the nuclear modification factor (R AA ) for \u03c0 and p + K [3]. Now Figure 3 shows the R AA as a function of p T for pions, kaons and protons, the results are presented for 0-5% and 60-80%. For the most central events and at intermediate p T (2-8 GeV/c), R AA \u03c0 < R AA p and R AA \u03c0 \u223c R AA K , no significant species dependence is seen at high p T .",
