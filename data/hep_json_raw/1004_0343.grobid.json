The theory predicts [1] that the vector meson polarization should become transverse in the perturbative regime; i.e., at large transverse momentum p T of the vector meson. However, the prediction is not supported by experimental observations [2]. We describe new results on this topic from the Tevatron. We define a parameter-\u03b1 to measure the polarization:",

Fig. 1 shows the comparison between the theoretical prediction of \u03d2(1S) (colored band) and the new CDF (left) [3] and D0 (right) [4] experimental results. In the low p T region, CDF shows nearly-unpolarized events, which is consistent with the CDF Run I result [5]; D0 shows partially longitudinally polarized events. At higher p T , the CDF results tend toward longitudinal polarization while the D0 result indicates transverse polarization. Both CDF and D0 results at high p T deviate from theoretical predictions. It will be interesting to investigate it with more data and in some detail; e.g. study \u03b7 dependence since CDF and D0 have different \u03b7 acceptance.",

We fit the X(3872) mass signal with a Breit-Wigner function convoluted with a resolution function [12]. Both functions contain a width scale factor that is a free parameter in the fit and therefore sensitive to the shape of the mass signal. The measured width scale factor is compared to the values seen in simulations which assume two states with the given mass difference and ratio of events. The resolution in the simulated events is corrected for the difference between data and simulation as measured from the \u03c8(2S). The result of this hypotheses test shows that the data is consistent with a single state. Under the assumption of two states with equal amount of observed events, we set a limit of \u2206m < 3.2(3.6) MeV/c 2 at 90% (95%) C.L.

We do not distinguish the B + signal at all before the L xy (B + ) and kaon LLR requirements, but we see a clear B + signal after the requirements.

The MC events are smoothly distributed in the Dalitz plot and in the J/\u03c8\u03c6 mass spectrum. No artifacts were observed from MC events. Figure 7 shows the Dalitz plot of m 2 (\u03c6 K + ) versus m 2 (J/\u03c8\u03c6 ), and Fig. 8 shows the mass difference, \u2206M = m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) \u2212 m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), for events in the B + mass window in our data sample. We examine the enhancement in the \u2206M spectrum just above J/\u03c8\u03c6 threshold. We exclude the high-mass part of the spectrum beyond 1.56 GeV/c 2 to avoid combinatorial backgrounds that would be expected from misidentified B 0 s \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c6 \u2192 (J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c6 decays. We model the enhancement by an S-wave relativistic BW function [16] convoluted with a Gaussian resolution function with the RMS fixed to 1.7 MeV/c 2 obtained from MC, and use three-body phase space [11] to describe the background shape. An unbinned likelihood fit to the \u2206M distribution, as shown in Fig. 8, returns a yield of 14 \u00b1 5 events, a \u2206M of 1046.3 \u00b1 2.9 MeV/c 2 , and a width of 11.7 +8.3 \u22125.0 MeV/c 2 . To investigate possible reflections, we examine the Dalitz plot and projections into \u03c6 K + and J/\u03c8K + spectrum. We find no evidence for any other structure in the \u03c6 K + and J/\u03c8K + spectrum.",
