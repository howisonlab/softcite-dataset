JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) is a large liquid scintillator detector with low energy detection threshold and excellent energy resolution. The detector performances allow the atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements. In this work, a discrimination algorithm for different reaction channels of neutrino-nucleon interactions in the JUNO liquid scintillator, in the GeV/sub-GeV energy region, is presented. The atmospheric neutrino flux is taken as reference, considering (\u2212) \u03bd \u00b5 and (\u2212) \u03bd e . The different temporal behaviour of the classes of events have been exploited to build a time profile-based discrimination algorithm. The results show a good selection power for (\u2212) \u03bd e CC events, while the (\u2212) \u03bd \u00b5 CC component suffers of an important contamination from NC events at low energy, which is under study. Preliminary results are presented.",

            "text": "The origin and properties of Cosmic Rays (CRs) are still matter of study by a number of experiments. A fraction of the energy of an air shower, resulting after a CR interaction in the atmosphere, is carried by neutrinos. The atmospheric \u03bd flux is almost entirely composed of (\u2212) \u03bd \u00b5 and (\u2212) \u03bd e and spans many decades in energy, from the MeV up to the PeV scale. Neutrinos travelling across the Earth can be also used as a probe to study flavor oscillation effects in matter. After the experimental results in past years [1][2][3][4], further contributions to the atmospheric \u03bd spectrum will come from the next generation of neutrino detectors, operating in the next decade. JUNO is a large liquid scintillator detector with low energy threshold and excellent energy resolution (\u223c 3%/ \u221a E [MeV]), under construction in China [5]. Its core consists of a \u223c36 m diameter acrylic sphere, which will be filled with 20kt of liquid scintillator. The light produced in \u03bd interactions will be collected by a double-system of photosensors: 17.000 20\" PMTs and 25.000 3\" PMTs. Given the large fiducial volume and the excellent energy resolution, JUNO will be able to detect atmospheric neutrinos. A crucial part in the atmospheric \u03bd study is the correct identification of the original \u03bd flavor. Above \u223c100 MeV neutrinos can be assumed to interact with nucleons only. This implies that hadronic particles are always produced in the final state. In the case of a charged-current (CC) interaction, the a e-mail: giulio.settanta@uniroma3.it arXiv:1901.10340v2 [hep-ex] 30 Jan 2020 EPJ Web of Conferences corresponding charged lepton is also produced (either \u03bd \u00b5 N \u2192 \u00b5X or \u03bd e N \u2192 eX). In the case of a neutral-current (NC) interaction, only secondary hadrons and the scattered neutrino are in the final state.",

Furthermore, since hadrons add in general late energy releases to all events, they also make more similar \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e CC event topologies. The different temporal behaviour of the classes of events has been exploited to build a time profilebased discrimination algorithm. The 3\" PMT system has been used in the algorithm, since it is more accurate in time measurement. To reproduce realistic Time-Transit Spread (TTS) effects, an artificial smearing has been applied to the true hit time over every PMT. A gaussian function with \u03c3 = 4 ns has been used. A further selection on the smeared vertex is applied, in order to avoid edge effects, requiring it to be be within 16 m from the detector centre. The hit time-residual is defined for each PMT as:",

Since \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e CC events result in different light production duration, the RMS of the t res is used as a discrimination variable (here called \u03c3(t res )). In fig. 2 the \u03c3(t res ) distribution is reported for the three populations: \u03bd \u00b5 CC, \u03bd e CC and NC events. The variable is also reported for 4 different bins of number of PEs (NPE) collected by all 20\" PMTs, selected in order to have equal statistics in each bin. From fig. 2, a good separation of the \u03bd e CC component is evident, in all the energy bins. On the contrary, the \u03bd \u00b5 CC and the NC components are almost overlapped on the whole energy range. The NC component contribution, however, becomes less significant at high energy.
