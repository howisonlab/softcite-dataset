We apply a matrix element technique to dilepton and single-lepton+jets final states in data accumulated with the D0 detector that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 . The measured value of the correlation coefficient in the off-diagonal basis, O off = 0.89 \u00b1 0.22 (stat + syst), is in agreement with the standard model prediction, and represents evidence for a top-antitop quark spin correlation difference from zero at a level of 4.2 standard deviations.",

Despite the fact that the top quark decays weakly, its large mass leads to a very short lifetime of \u2248 5 \u2022 10 \u221225 s [5][6][7]. It decays to a W boson and a b quark before hadronizing, a process that has a characteristic time of 1/ QCD \u2248 (200 MeV) \u22121 equivalent to \u03c4 had \u2248 3.3 \u2022 10 \u221224 s, where QCD is the fundamental scale of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The top quark lifetime is also smaller than the spin-decorrelation time from spin-spin interactions with the light quarks generated in the fragmentation process [8], \u03c4 spin \u2248 m t / 2 QCD \u2248 (0.2 MeV) \u22121 \u2248 3 \u2022 10 \u221221 s [9]. The top quark thus provides a unique opportunity to measure spin-related phenomena in the quark sector by exploiting kinematic properties of its decay products.",

This QCD process yields unpolarized t and t quarks, but leaves the spins 202 D0 Collaboration / Physics Letters B 757 (2016) 199-206 of t and t correlated. A spin correlation observable can be defined as [10] O ab = 4(S t \u2022\u00e2)(S\u00aft \u2022b) = \u03c3 (\u2191\u2191) + \u03c3 (\u2193\u2193) \u2212 \u03c3 (\u2191\u2193) \u2212 \u03c3 (\u2193\u2191) \u03c3 (\u2191\u2191) + \u03c3 (\u2193\u2193) + \u03c3 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03c3 (\u2193\u2191) , where S is a spin operator, \u00e2, b are the spin quantization axes for the top quark (\u00e2) and the antitop quark (b), refers to an expectation value, \u03c3 is the tt production cross section, and the arrows refer to the spin states of the t and t quarks relative to the \u00e2 and b axes. The strength of the correlation depends on the tt production mechanism [11][12][13]. In pp collisions at a center-ofmass energy of 1.96 TeV, the correlation of spins is predicted to be O off = 0.80 +0.01 \u22120.02 [10] in the off-diagonal spin basis, the basis in which the strength of the spin correlation is maximal at the Tevatron [12]. The most significant contribution is from the quark-antiquark annihilation process (qq \u2192 tt) with a spin correlation strength of \u2248 0.99, while the gluon-gluon (gg) fusion process (gg \u2192 tt) has anticorrelated spins with a typical strength of \u2248 \u22120.36 at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD [10,14,15]. Contributions to tt production from beyond the SM can have different dynamics that affect the strength of the tt spin correlation.",

Spin correlation effects have also been measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions by two LHC collaborations, ATLAS and CMS, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV [19][20][21][22] and at 8 TeV [23,24]. The main mechanism for tt production at the LHC is the gg fusion process. The spin correlation at the LHC arises mainly from the fusion of like-helicity gluons [25]. The differences between pp and pp incident channels, the different sources of spin correlation (quarkantiquark annihilation versus like-helicity gg fusion), and their different collision energies, make the measurements of the strength of the spin correlation at both the Tevatron and LHC interesting and complementary.",

To identify b quark jets, we use a multivariate b quark jet identification discriminant that combines information from the impact parameters of the tracks and variables that characterize the presence and properties of secondary vertices within the jet [37]. We require that at least one jet is identified as a b quark jet in the channels, and at least two such jets in the +jets channels. To improve signal purity, additional selections based on the global event topology are applied [38,39] in each final state. A detailed description of event selection can be found in Ref.

We estimate the significance of the non-zero spin correlation hypothesis  To translate the f value to the spin correlation strength in the off-diagonal basis O off , we must consider the value of the spin correlation strength in the simulation O MC off . We choose to obtain this value in the simulated samples from the expected value of k 1 k 2 O MC off = \u22129 cos \u03b8 1 \u2022 cos \u03b8 2 [14], where \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 represent angles between the respective direction of a positively and negatively charged lepton and the spin quantization axes in the t and t rest frame. The parameters k 1 and k 2 are the spin analyzingpower coefficients of the top quark (equal to 1 for leptons at LO in QCD) [53]. With mc@nlo, the value calculated for the parton-level distributions before any selections is found to equal O mc@nlo off = 0.766 in the off-diagonal basis. The measured spin correlation strength for +jets and channels is therefore",

The spin correlation measurement thus provides a way of measuring the fraction of events produced via gg fusion, f gg [13]. The f gg fraction is not well defined at orders higher than LO QCD. The difficulty arises from the fact that the cross sections for the gq \u2192 ttq and gq \u2192 ttq processes at LO, as well as gg and qq production at NLO, contain a singularity when the final state quark is collinear with the quark in the initial state. This makes the integration over the phase space divergent [15,54,55]. In practice, this singularity is absorbed into the definition of the PDF, but the final results depend on the scheme used for regularization. For the NLO PDF, the MS scheme is usually preferred. The gq and gq contribution at NLO is of the order of a few percent [10,14,15], and considering that the overall spin correlation strength is \u2248 80%, we neglect these smaller contributions, and determine f gg from the relation",

The detector transfer functions, W (x, y), correspond to the probability to reconstruct four-momenta y as x, d 6 represents the six-body phase space, and \u03c3 obs is the observed tt production cross section, calculated using M (H = null), taking into account the efficiency of the selection. The same \u03c3 obs is used for H = null and H = SM hypotheses, because the difference in observed cross-sections is small, at the order of percent, and affects only the separation power of the discriminant R. This calculation uses the LO matrix element M (y, H ) for the processes qq \u2192 tt \u2192 W + W \u2212 bb \u2192 \u00b1 \u03bd qq bb or + \u2212 \u03bd \u03bd bb, calculated according to the spin correlation hypothesis H .

For the +jets channel, in addition to the Drell-Yan and diboson production, the contribution from W +jets production is estimated from MC simulation, but normalized to data.
