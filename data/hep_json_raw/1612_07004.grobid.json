The analysis is performed in the dilepton final state, characterised by the presence of two isolated leptons (electrons or muons). There are 15 observables, each sensitive to a different coefficient of the spin density matrix of tt production, which are measured independently. Ten of these observables are measured for the first time. All of them are corrected for detector resolution and acceptance effects back to the parton and stable-particle levels. The measured values of the observables at parton level are compared to Standard Model predictions at next-to-leading order in QCD. The corrected distributions at stable-particle level are presented and the means of the distributions are compared to Monte Carlo predictions. No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed for any observable.",

Its mass is of the order of the electroweak scale, which suggests that it might play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking. Furthermore, since the top quark has a very short lifetime of O(10 \u221225 s) [3][4][5] it decays before hadronisation and before any consequent spin-flip can JHEP03(2017)113 take place. This offers a unique opportunity to study the properties of a bare quark and, in particular, the properties of its spin.",

            "text": "Top quarks at the LHC are mostly produced in tt pairs via the strong interaction, which conserves parity. The quarks 1 and gluons of the initial state are unpolarised, which means that their spins are not preferentially aligned with any given direction. The top quarks produced in pairs are thus unpolarised except for the contribution of weak corrections and QCD absorptive parts at the per-mill level [6]. However, the spins of the top and antitop quarks are correlated with a strength depending on the spin quantisation axis and on the production process. Various new physics phenomena can alter the polarisation and spin correlation due to alternative production mechanisms [6][7][8][9]. The spins of the top quarks do not become decorrelated due to hadronisation, and so their spin information is transferred to their decay products. This makes it possible to measure the top quark pair's spin structure using angular observables of their decay products. The predictions for many of these observables are available at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A few of them have been measured by the experiments at the LHC and Tevatron and found to be in good agreement with the Standard Model (SM) predictions [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18].",

At parton level, the measured values of the polarisation and spin correlation observables are presented and compared to theoretical predictions. All observables allow a direct measurement of their corresponding expectation value. At stable-particle level, the distributions corrected for detector acceptance and resolution are provided. Because of the limited phase-space used at that level, the values of the polarisation and spin correlations are not proportional to the means of these distributions.

[19]. In the calculations of cos \u03b8 with respect to the negatively charged lepton, the axes are multiplied by \u22121. The observables and corresponding expectation values, as well as their SM predictions at NLO, are shown in table 1. The first six observables correspond to the polarisations of the top and antitop quarks along the various axes, the other nine to the spin correlations. In order to distinguish between the correlation observables, the correlations using only one axis are referred to as spin correlations and the last six as cross correlations. The predictions are computed for a top quark mass of 173.34 GeV [23]. In order to measure all observables, the final-state particles of both decay chains must be reconstructed and correctly identified. As charged leptons retain more information about the spin state of the top quarks, and as they can be precisely reconstructed, the measurement in this paper is performed in the dileptonic final state of tt events. The charged leptons considered in this analysis are electrons or muons, either originating directly from W and Z decays, or through an intermediate \u03c4 decay.",

The reconstruction algorithm used is the anti-k t [47] algorithm with a radius parameter of R = 0.4. The measured energy of the jets is corrected to the hadronic scale using p T -and \u03b7-dependent scale factors derived from simulation and validated in data [48]. After the energy correction, they are required to have a transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and a pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.5. For jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, the jet vertex fraction (JVF) must be greater than 0.5. The JVF is defined as the fraction of the scalar p T sum of tracks associated with the jet and the primary vertex and the scalar p T sum of tracks associated with the jet and any vertex. It distinguishes between jets originating from the primary vertex and jets with a large contribution from other proton interactions in the same bunch crossing (pile-up). If separated by \u2206R < 0.2, the jet closest to a selected electron is removed to avoid double-counting of electrons reconstructed as jets. Next, all electrons and muons separated from a jet by \u2206R < 0.4 are removed from the list of selected leptons to reject semileptonic decays within a jet. Jets containing b-hadrons are identified (b-tagged) by using a multivariate algorithm (MV1) [49] which uses information about the tracks and secondary vertices. If the MV1 output for a jet is larger than a predefined value, the jet is considered to be b-tagged. The value was chosen to achieve a b-tagging efficiency of 70%. With this algorithm, the probability to select a light jet (from gluons or u-, d-, s-quarks) is around 0.8%, and the probability to select a jet from a c-quark is 20%. The",

The MC estimate for the Drell-Yan and fake-lepton background is normalised using data-driven scale factors (SF). The Drell-Yan background does not contain any real E miss T . Nonnegligible E miss T can appear in a fraction of events with misreconstructed objects, which are difficult to model. Since real E miss T is present in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, no scale factors are applied to this sample. Another issue is the correct normalisation of Drell-Yan events with additional heavy-flavour (HF) jets from b-and c-quarks after the b-tagging requirement. In order to correct for these effects, three control regions are defined, from which three SF are extracted. Two correspond to the E miss T modelling in Z \u2192 ee (SF ee ) and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events (SF \u00b5\u00b5 ), and one for the heavy-flavour normalisation in Z+jets events (SF HF ) common to the three dilepton channels. All control regions require the same selection as the signal region with the exception that the invariant mass of the two leptons should be within 10 GeV of the Z mass. The control regions are then distinguished by dividing them into a pretag (n b-tag \u2265 0) and a b-tag region (n b-tag \u2265 1), additionally dividing the pretag region into the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels. The purity of the pretag control region is 97% on average for both channels. The purity of the b-tag region is 75%. The SF are extracted by solving a system of equations which relates the number of events in data and in simulation in the three control regions.

This is achieved by applying the same requirements as for the signal region, except that two leptons of the same charge are required. As fake leptons have approximately the same probability of having negative or positive charge, the same number of fake-lepton events should populate the opposite-sign and same-sign selection regions. The same-sign control region has a smaller background contribution from other processes, allowing the study of the modelling of the fake-lepton background. Channel-dependent scale factors are derived by normalising the predictions to data in the control regions, while the shapes of the distributions are taken from MC simulation. The SF in the ee and e\u00b5 channels are around 1.0 and 1.5, whereas the SF in the \u00b5\u00b5 channel is about 4. The differences between the three scale factors originate from the sources of misidentified electrons and muons, which seem to be modelled better in MC simulation for the electrons. However, the shapes of the distributions of several kinematic variables in the \u00b5\u00b5 channel are cross-checked in control regions and found to be consistent with the distributions from a purely data-driven method.

A hypothesis is made for the value of the pseudorapidity of each neutrino and the kinematics of the system is then solved. For each solution found, a weight is assigned to quantify the level of agreement between the vectorial sum of neutrino transverse momenta and the measured E miss T components. The pseudorapidities of the neutrinos are scanned independently between \u22125 and 5 with fixed steps of 0.025 in the range [\u22122, 2] and of 0.05 outside of that range. All possible combinations of jets and leptons are tested. Additionally, the resolution of the jet energy measurement is taken into account by smearing the energy of each jet 50 times. The smearing is done using transfer functions mapping the energy at particle level to the energy after detector simulation. Out of all the solutions obtained, the one with the highest weight is selected. The reconstruction efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction in the tt signal sample is about 88%.

The distributions of observables are reweighted to inject different values of the polarisations and correlations. For the polarisations and spin correlations, the double-differential cross section (equation (3.1)) is used, while a linear reweighting is used for the cross correlations. The unfolded value for each reweighted distribution is then compared to the true value of polarisation or spin correlation and a calibration curve is built. Non-closure in the linearity test appears as a slope different from one in the calibration curve. The number of bins and the bin widths for each observable are chosen based on its resolution and optimised by evaluating the expected statistical uncertainty and by limiting the bias in the linearity test. The binning optimisation leads to a four-bin configuration for the polarisation observables and six-bin configurations for the different correlation observables. An uncertainty is added to cover the non-closure of the linearity test, which is at most 10%.

The reconstructed distribution, varied to reflect a systematic uncertainty, is compared to the nominal distribution and the average change per bin is taken as the width of the Gaussian prior, as discussed in section 6.2. In order to estimate the impact of each source of systematic uncertainty individually, pseudodata corresponding to the sum of the nominal signal and background samples are used. The unfolding procedure with marginalisation is applied to the pseudodata and constraints on the systematic uncertainties are obtained. The strongest constraint is on the uncertainty related to the electron identification and it reduces this systematic uncertainty by 50%. The other constraints are of the order of a few percent. The constrained systematic uncertainties are then used to build the \u00b11\u03c3 variations of the prediction. The varied pseudodata are then unfolded without marginalisation.

Table 5 presents the results for the polarisations and correlations at parton level. It shows the central value and the total uncertainty as well as a breakdown of the systematic uncertainties for the various categories described in section 6.3. Figure 5 shows the predictions at 8 TeV calculated in ref. [19] and the unfolded result. None of the observables deviate significantly from the SM predictions. The transverse correlation, C(n, n), differs from the case of no spin correlation by 5.1 standard deviations. The correlations between the different polarisation and spin correlations were evaluated and found to be small. The highest correlations are found to be around 10% between the polarisation and spin correlation along the helicity axis and the r-axis and between some cross correlations. Figures 6 to 8 show the observable distributions corrected back to stable-particle level and compared to the generated distribution created from Powheg-hvq +Pythia6. No significant difference between the shapes of the observed and predicted distributions is observed. The means of the distributions are compared between unfolded data and MC predictions. They are presented in table 5. In order to compare the size of the uncertainties with the parton level measurement, the means of the polarisation observables are multiplied by a factor of 3 and the correlations by a factor of \u22129 (section 3). Overall the total uncertainties for the measurements at parton and particle level are comparable. The mass uncertainty is shown separately and not added to the total uncertainty, as explained in section 6.3. The dependence of the measured polarisations and spin correlations on the MC top quark mass is presented in table 6.

The total uncertainty corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the uncertainty obtained from the unfolding procedure with marginalisation (including the background and detector modelling), the signal modelling and the \"Others\" category. The numbers shown for the \"Detector\" category correspond to the sum in quadrature of the individual estimates obtained as described in section 6.3. The sum in quadrature of the values in the various columns thus does not necessarily match with the total uncertainty. The uncertainty related to the top quark mass is presented separately.

Each of the observables is sensitive to a different coefficient of the spin density matrix of tt production. The observable distributions are corrected back to the parton and stable-particle level. At parton level, the measurements along the helicity axis are These values are in good agreement with the NLO SM predictions of B k + = 0.0030\u00b10.0010, B k \u2212 = 0.0034\u00b10.0010 and C(k, k) = 0.318\u00b10.003. The spin correlation along the transverse axis differs from zero with a significance of 5.1 \u03c3. At stable-particle level, the unfolded distributions are compared to their prediction from MC simulation (Powheg-hvq +Pythia6). All distributions are in agreement with the predictions.",
