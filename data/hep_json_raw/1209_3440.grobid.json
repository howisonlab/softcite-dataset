The experimental branching fraction upper limits for the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are already quite close to the branching fraction predicted by the Standard Model, and the first observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is expected soon. The rare decays B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are highly suppressed in the Standard Model, and therefore accurate measurements of these branching fractions provide complementary constraints to the free parameters of various extensions of the Standard Model.",

            "text": "The decay channels B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are flavour-changing neutral current processes, which are forbidden in the Standard Model (SM) at the tree level, and occur only via higher order diagrams. In addition, the decays are helicity suppressed by m 2 \u00b5 /m 2 B . The branching fraction predicted by the SM for the decay channel B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is (3.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u2022 10 \u22129 , and the predicted SM branching fraction for the decay B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is (1.0 \u00b1 0.1) \u2022 10 \u221210 [1]. Possible new particles contributing in higher order diagrams typically increase the branching fractions, and therefore these decay channels are sensitive to new physics beyond the SM. The branching fractions can be, however, also suppressed with respect to the SM predicted values in some regions of the parameter space [2]. Precision measurements of the branching fractions and their ratio will thus serve as a test of the SM and as a constraint of the allowed parameter space of models beyond the SM. For a recent theoretical overview on the constraints on new physics in rare B decays, see e.g. Ref. [3].",

            "text": "It has recently been pointed out [4], that the SM prediction for the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fraction becomes (3.5 \u00b1 0.2) \u2022 10 \u22129 , when taking into account that the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays are integrated over all decay times and averaged over untagged B 0 s decays. The SM fit of the CKM matrix and CP violation parameters [5] gives BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )=(3.64 +0.21 \u22120.32 ) \u2022 10 \u22129 . The branching fraction BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) (BR(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )) can be measured relative to a well-known decay, for example B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , as: the total efficiency to trigger and reconstruct signal (B + ) events, and f u / f s is the fraction of the production fraction of B + (u) and B 0 s mesons. Experimentally the channels B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are relatively simple to trigger and reconstruct. The combinatorial backgrounds bb \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X and b \u2192 c\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd\u03bd constitute typically the major background for B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . These background sources can be measured from the data by fitting the signal mass region sidebands. Peaking backgrounds B \u2192 h \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd and B \u2192 h + h \u2212 , where h = \u03c0, K, p are misidentified as muons, are more important for B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 because of the lower mass and smaller branching fraction, while for B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 they play a minor role. CDF, CMS and LHCb experiments have sufficient mass resolution to clearly separate the B 0 and B 0 s mass peaks. Muon misidentification rates can be derived from the data for example by using D * -tagged D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The backgrounds from other exclusive decays such as B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3, B + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + and B c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u00b5 + \u03bd are so far negligible. Typical discriminating variables used in analyses are transverse momenta p T of the B and of the muons, quality of the secondary (dimuon) and primary vertex fits, requirements on the secondary dimuon vertex (flight length and significance, impact parameter of the B and/or of the muons and their significance), pointing angle of the B, isolation of the dimuon, and association of the B to the correct primary vertex. The experiments perform their analyses blinded, i.e. the selection cuts are tuned without looking at the signal mass region.",

            "text": "The experimental results from LHC reported here stem from the data collected in 2011. ATLAS and CMS experiments collected an integrated luminosity of about 5 fb \u22121 . LHCb collected an integrated luminosity of about 1 fb \u22121 , because the instantaneous luminosity was leveled to a maximum of about 4 \u2022 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The ATLAS experiment [9] results on the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fraction were obtained with an integrated luminosity of 2.4 fb \u22121 [10]. Mainly dimuon triggers were used to collect the data. The analysis was performed separately for three different pseudorapidity regions |\u03b7| < 1.0, 1.0 < |\u03b7| < 1.5, and 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.5, because of the different mass resolutions in these regions. Boosted decision trees (BDT) were used to separate signal and background. ATLAS has no sensitivity to B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , because the mass resolution is not sufficient to separate B 0 s and B 0 decays. The background from B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay to the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channel was assumed to be zero. ATLAS obtained a branching fraction limit of BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 22 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL. The median expected limit was BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 25 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL. The results by the CMS experiment [11] were obtained with an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 [12]. The dataset was collected with a displaced dimuon trigger, requiring 4.8 < m \u00b5 \u00b5 < 6.0 GeV and that the muons originate from a common good-quality threedimensionally measured vertex. The cut-and-count analysis was tuned separately for the barrel (both muons with |\u03b7| < 1.4) and endcap (at least one of the muons with |\u03b7| > 1.4) regions. Pileup independence of the selection efficiences was carefully studied with the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 data samples. The selection efficiencies were found to be constant for events with up to 30 primary vertices. The branching fraction limits obtained were: BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 7.7 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL (median expected limit BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 8.4 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL), and BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.8 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL (median expected limit BR(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.6 \u2022 10 \u22129 at 95% CL). The final dimuon mass distributions are shown in Fig. 2.  The LHCb experiment [13] used an integrated luminosity of 1 fb \u22121 to obtain their B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 results [14]. LHCb used three different normalization channels: B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 , and B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . Charged hadron identification by the RICH detectors was used to separate kaons, pions and protons. The decays B 0 \u2192 h + h \u2212 , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and dimuon resonances were used to control the particle identification, mass scale, and multivariate methods.",

In 2012 it is expected that ATLAS and CMS experiments will collect an integrated luminosity of at least 20 fb \u22121 each, on top of the 5 fb \u22121 collected in 2011. LHCb will collect an integrated luminosity of 1.5 -2 fb \u22121 , to be added to the 1 fb \u22121 collected in 2011. It is unlikely that the decay B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 would be observed at the LHC any time soon, without very significant enhancements to the SM rate. Nevertheless, searches for B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 will be pursued as a long-term goal.",
