The evolution of the noise occupancy is discussed, and measurements of the Lorentz angle, \u03b4 -ray production and energy loss presented. The alignment of the detector is found to be stable at the few-micron level over long periods of time. Radiation damage measurements, which include the evolution of detector leakage currents, are found to be consistent with predictions and are used in the verification of radiation background simulations.

In addition to measurements of Standard Model processes such as vector-boson and top-quark production, the properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson [3,4] are being investigated and searches are being carried out for as yet undiscovered particles such as those predicted by theories including supersymmetry. All of these studies rely heavily on the excellent performance of the ATLAS inner detector tracking system. The semiconductor tracker (SCT) is a precision silicon microstrip detector which forms an integral part of this tracking system.",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector is divided into three main components. A high-precision toroid-field muon spectrometer surrounds electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, which in turn surround the inner detector. This comprises three complementary subdetectors: a silicon pixel detector covering radial distances 1 between 50.5 mm and 150 mm, the SCT covering radial distances from 299 mm to 560 mm and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) covering radial distances from 563 mm to 1066 mm. These detectors are surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. The layout of the inner detector, showing the SCT together with the pixel detector and transition radiation tracker, is shown in figure 1. The inner detector measures the trajectories of charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It has been designed to provide a transverse momentum resolution, in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, of \u03c3 p T /p T = 0.05% \u00d7 p T [ GeV] \u2295 1% and a transverse impact parameter resolution of 10 \u00b5m for highmomentum particles in the central pseudorapidity region [1]. After installation in the ATLAS cavern was completed in August 2008, the SCT underwent an extensive period of commissioning and calibration before the start of LHC proton-proton collisions in late 2009. The performance of the detector was measured using cosmic-ray data [5]; the intrinsic hit efficiency and the noise occupancy were found to be well within the design requirements. This paper describes the operation and performance of the SCT during the first years of LHC operation, from autumn 2009 to February 2013, referred to as 'Run 1'. During this period the ATLAS experiment collected proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV corresponding to integrated luminosities [6] of 5.1 fb \u22121 and 21.3 fb \u22121 respectively, together with small amounts at \u221a s = 900 GeV and 2.76 TeV. In addition, 158 \u00b5b \u22121 of lead-lead collision data at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV and 30 nb \u22121 of proton-lead data at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5 TeV were recorded. The collision data are used to measure the intrinsic hit efficiency of the silicon modules and the Lorentz angle. Compared with the previous results using cosmic-ray data [5], the efficiency measurements are now extended to the endcap regions of the detector, and the large number of tracks has allowed the Lorentz angle to be studied in more detail. In addition, studies of energy loss and \u03b4 -ray production in the silicon have been performed.",

The SCT typically provides eight strip measurements (four space-points) for particles originating in the beam-interaction region. The barrel modules [7] are of a uniform design, with strips approximately parallel to the magnetic field and beam axis. Each module consists of four rectangular silicon-strip sensors [8] with strips with a constant pitch of 80 \u00b5m; two sensors on each side are daisy-chained together to give 768 strips of approximately 12 cm in length. A second pair of identical sensors is glued back-to-back with the first pair at a stereo angle of 40 mrad. The modules are mounted on cylindrical supports such that the module planes are at an angle to the tangent to the cylinder of 11 \u2022 for the inner two barrels and 11.25 \u2022 for the outer two barrels, and overlap by a few millimetres to provide a hermetic tiling in azimuth.",

Each of the 128 channels of the ABCD has a preamplifier and shaper stage; the output has a shaping time of \u223c20 ns and is then discriminated to provide a binary output. A common discriminator threshold is applied to all 128 channels, normally corresponding to a charge of 1 fC, and settable by an 8-bit DAC. To compensate for variations in individual channel thresholds, each channel has its own 4-bit DAC (TrimDAC) used to offset the comparator threshold and enable uniformity of response across the chip.

A schematic diagram of the data acquisition system is shown in figure 3. Each ROD processes data for up to 48 modules, and the BOC provides the optical interface between the ROD and the modules; the BOC also transmits the reformatted data for those 48 modules to the ATLAS data acquisition (DAQ) chain via a single fibre known as an 'S-link'. There is one timing, trigger and control (TTC) stream per module from the BOC to the module, and two data streams returned from each module corresponding to the two sides of the module. The transmission is based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) operating at a wavelength of 850 nm and uses radiation-hard fibres [12]. The TTC data are broadcast at 40 Mb/s to the modules via 12-way VCSEL arrays, and converted back to electrical signals by silicon p-i-n diodes on the on-detector optical harnesses. Data are optically transmitted back from the modules at 40 Mb/s and received by arrays of silicon p-i-n diodes on the BOC. -5 -Redundancy is implemented for both the transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) optical links, in case of fibre breaks, VCSEL failures or diode problems. Redundancy is built into the TX system by having electrical links from one module to its neighbour. If a module loses its TTC signal for any reason, an electrical control line can be set which results in the neighbouring module sending a copy of its TTC data to the module with the failed signal, without any impact on operation. For the data links, one side of the module can be configured to be read out through the other link. Although readout of both sides of the module though one RX link inevitably reduces the readout bandwidth, this is still within design limits for SCT operation. For the barrel modules, readout of both sides through one link also results in the loss of one ABCD chip on the re-routed link because the full redundancy scheme was not implemented due to lack of space on the readout hybrid. Table 1 shows the number of optical links configured to use the redundancy mechanism at the end of data-taking in February 2013. The RX links configured to read out both module sides were mainly due to connectivity defects during installation of the SCT, and the number remained stable throughout Run 1. The use of the TX redundancy mechanism varied significantly due to VCSEL failures, discussed in section 3.5. Table 1. Numbers of optical links configured to use the redundancy mechanism in February 2013, in the barrel, the endcaps and the whole SCT. The last column shows the corresponding fraction of all links in the detector. ",

The target temperature for the SCT silicon sensors after irradiation is \u22127 \u2022 C, which was chosen to moderate the effects of radiation damage. An interlock system, fully implemented in hardware, using two temperature sensors located at the end of a half cooling-loop for 24 barrel modules or either 10 or 13 endcap modules, prevents the silicon modules from overheating in the event of a cooling failure by switching off power to the associated channels within approximately one second. The cooling system is interfaced to and monitored by the detector control system, and is operated independently of the status of SCT operation. The SCT detector control system (DCS) [14] operates within the framework of the overall ATLAS DCS [15]. Custom embedded local monitor boards [16], designed to operate in the strong magnetic field and high-radiation environment within ATLAS, provide the interface between the detector hardware and the readout system. Data communication through controller area network 5 (CAN) buses, alarm handling and data display are handled by a series of PCs running the commercial controls software PVSS-II. 6 The DCS is responsible for operating the power-supply system: setting the high-voltage (HV) supplies to the voltage necessary to deplete the sensors and the low-voltage (LV) supplies for the read-out electronics and optical-link operation. It monitors voltages and currents, and also environmental parameters such as temperatures of sensors, support structures and cooling pipes, and the relative humidity within the detector volume. The DCS must ensure safe and reliable operation of the SCT, by taking appropriate action in the event of failure or error conditions.",

It provides information to augment track-based alignment by determining the internal distortions of the SCT structure on short, medium and long timescales. Lengths are measured using 842 laser interferometers arranged in a geodetic grid covering the detector; the grid layout is shown in figure 4a. The lengths of the grid lines are measured in real time and compared to a reference length provided by an off-detector reference system in a controlled environment. Two lasers are used to scan the frequencies in opposite directions (increasing, decreasing) to cancel drift errors. The light from each laser is split into two beams to be sent simultaneously to the endcap and barrel sections of the system. The beams are then split close to the detector into the hundreds of interferometers. The same light is also sent to the reference system for later analysis. The working principle of the individual interferometers is shown in figure 4b. The distance is measured between two components of each interferometer: a 'quill' which contains the light delivery and return fibres, and a distant retro-reflector. The wide-angle beam emerging from the quill provides tolerance to small misalignments which may occur during the planned ten-year operational lifetime. As a trade off, the interferometer provides a return signal of around only 1 pW per mW of input power, for a 1 m interferometer length.",

The SCT remains continuously powered regardless of the LHC status. In the absence of stable beam conditions at the LHC, the SCT modules are biased at a reduced high voltage of 50 V to ensure that the silicon sensors are only partially depleted; in the unlikely event of a significant beam loss, this ensures that a maximum of 50 V is applied temporarily across the strip oxides, which is not enough to cause electrical breakdown. Normal data-taking requires a bias voltage of 150 V on the silicon in order to maximise hit efficiencies for tracking, and the process of switching the SCT from standby at 50 V to on at 150 V is referred to as the 'warm start'. Once the LHC declares stable beam conditions, the SCT is automatically switched on if the LHC collimators are at their nominal positions for physics, if the background rates measured in BCM, BLM and the ATLAS forward detectors are low enough, and if the SCT hit occupancy with 50 V is consistent with the expected luminosity.",

The system was usually operated continuously apart from 10-20 days of maintenance annually while the LHC was shut down. Routine maintenance (e.g. compressor replacements) could be performed throughout the year without affecting the operation, as only four of the available seven compressors were actually required for operation. In the first year, the system had several problems with compressors, leaks of fluid and malfunctioning valves. However, operation in 2011 and 2012 was significantly more stable, following increased experience and optimisation of maintenance procedures. For example, in 2011 there were only two problems coming from the system itself out of 19 cooling stops. The number of active cooling loops as a function of time during Run 1 is shown in figure 5a. Figure 5b shows the mean temperatures for each barrel and each endcap ring in the same time period, as measured by sensors mounted on the hybrid of each module. The inner three barrels were maintained at a hybrid temperature of approximately 2 \u2022 C, while the outermost barrel and the endcap disk temperatures were around 7 \u2022 C. The mean temperatures of each layer were stable within about one degree throughout the three-year period.",

The response to the calibration charge when scanning the discriminator threshold is parameterised using a complementary error function. The threshold at which the occupancy is 50% (vt50) corresponds to the median of the injected charge, while the Gaussian spread gives the noise after amplification. The process is repeated for several calibration charges (typically 0.5 fC to 8 fC).

As expected these TXs demonstrated improved robustness against humidity, compared to the older arrays, when measuring the optical spectra of the VCSEL light in controlled conditions [23]. During 2012, the new VCSELs nonetheless had a small but significant failure rate, suspected to be a result of mechanical stress arising from thermal mismatch between the optical epoxy on the VCSEL surface and the GaAs of the VCSEL itself.

The design requirement is that the resolution of track parameters be degraded by no more than 20% with respect to the intrinsic resolution [29], which means that the SCT modules must be aligned with a precision of 12 \u00b5m in the direction perpendicular to the strips. The principle method of determining the inner detector alignment uses a \u03c7 2 technique that minimises the residuals to fitted tracks from pp collision events. Alignment is performed sequentially at different levels of detector granularity starting with the largest structures (barrel, endcaps) followed by alignment of individual layers and finally the positions of individual modules are optimised. The number of degrees of freedom at the different levels increases from 24 at the first level to 23328 at the module level. This kind of alignment addresses the 'strong modes', where a misalignment would change the \u03c7 2 distribution of the residuals to a track. There is also a class of misalignment where the \u03c7 2 fit to a single track is not affected but the value of measured momentum is systematically shifted. These are the 'weak-mode' misalignments which are measured using a variety of techniques, for example using tracks from the decay products of resonances like the J/\u03c8 and the Z boson. Details of the alignment techniques used in the ATLAS experiment can be found elsewhere [30,31].",

The Lorentz angle is the angle between the drift direction and the normal to the plane of the sensor which arises when the charge carriers are subject to the magnetic field from the solenoid as well as the electric field generated by the bias voltage. A single value of the Lorentz angle, calculated as described in section 6.5 assuming a uniform value of the electric field over the entire depth of the wafer, is used irrespective of the original position of the hole cloud. The drift time is calculated as the sum of two components: one corresponding to drift perpendicular to the detector surface, calculated assuming an electric field distribution as in a uniform flat diode, and a second corresponding to drift along the surface, introduced to address deficiencies in the simple model and give better agreement with test-beam data.",

The number of readout errors, strip hits and simple space-points (identified as a coincidence between hits on the two sides of a module within \u00b1128 strips of each other) are monitored as a function of time and features of a run can be studied.

For the endcaps, chips reading out Hamamatsu and CiS sensors are shown separately. Clusters around 1000 electrons in figure 13a reflect the shorter strip lengths of endcap inner and middle-short sensors. Noise occupancies of endcap inner and middle-short modules are not shown due to large errors on the low occupancy values. Almost all chips satisfy the SCT requirement of less than 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 in noise occupancy for both periods.  Table 5 shows mean values of the response-curve ENCs as well as logarithmic means of the noise occupancy at 1 fC for all ten types of module. The last column of the table shows the ratios of mean ENC values in December 2012 to those in October 2010, corrected (by at most 0.3%) to compensate for the effects of small differences in module temperatures between the two periods. After receiving 30 fb \u22121 of delivered luminosity, the noise remained almost unchanged for barrel and endcap outer modules, while it increased by about 10% in the endcap middle modules with CiS sensors and 6% in endcap inner modules with either Hamamatsu or CiS sensors. The median charge deposited by a minimum-ionising charged particle at normal incidence, measured in threshold scans in beam tests, is 3.5\u00b10.1 fC at a bias voltage of 300 V (0.15 fC lower at 150 V) for unirradiated modules [43]. Thus the signal-to-noise ratio is about 13 for sensors of length 12 cm and about 20 for endcap inner sensors. Even with the observed increase of \u223c10% for some endcap sensors, the signal-to-noise ratio is safely higher than the value of nine needed for efficient operation.",

Similar noise decreases were observed in the endcap modules but they strongly depended on the module side. Disconnected strip channels showed no decrease. In 2011 and 2012, no such noise decrease was observed, rather the noise returned to the original value and the chip-number dependence disappeared as shown by the 2011 points in figure 15.

The colours correspond to those in figure 4c. The changes in the lengths of the flange lines (movements) are most likely correlated to changes in power load (and hence temperature) in the front-end amplifiers at high trigger rate, and indicate a radial expansion and relative rotation of the barrels. The scale of the deviation is at the \u00b5m level and when the heating is removed the detector returns to the same pre-pp-collision position.

The overall efficiency is (99.74 \u00b1 0.04)%, where the error is systematic. The statistical error is negligible. The systematic uncertainty was estimated by varying the distance within which unassigned hits are included from zero to 500 \u00b5m ( +0.019 \u22120.014 %) and by considering the change when only module sides for which a hit was registered in the other side are used in the measurement (+0.036%).

As a cross-check, the efficiency was determined using different track selection criteria: varying the mimimum transverse momentum requirement between 0.5 GeV and 2 GeV, reducing the requirement on the minimum number of other SCT hits from six to five, and placing requirements on the number of hits in the pixel or TRT detectors. These variations give values within the uncertainty estimated by requiring a hit on the other module side.

To identify \u03b4 -rays, clusters for which w e < 80 \u00b5m are selected. The primary charge from such a particle can extend over at most two strips, and observed clusters larger than this arise primarily from \u03b4 -ray production. The production of a single \u03b4 -ray adds strips to one side of the cluster, leading to a shift in the cluster centroid, and -39 -a shift in the track residual 8 of approximately (w o \u2212 w e )/2. An example residual distribution for clusters of width six strips is shown in figure 26a. The peak at \u223c0.2 mm corresponding to single \u03b4 -ray production is superimposed on a background centred around zero which arises from effects such as multiple \u03b4 -ray production. The number of single \u03b4 -rays is estimated by fitting such residual distributions to the sum of two Gaussian functions: one for the signal peak with a mean away from zero and one for the background with a mean near zero. The choice of function is empirical, and is found to model the distributions well, giving \u03c7 2 /d.o. f values between 1.5 and 1.8.",

An additional 3.5% arises from comparison of the measured values of \u03c1 for different barrels, L and momentum ranges. The estimation of A from the integral of equation (6.6) makes use of the fraction of particles crossing one rather than two strips, which is not directly observed, but is approximated as the ratio of one-strip to two-strip clusters. This approximation, which is valid if the \u03b4 -ray production rate is low, adds an uncertainty of 2% to the rate. The overall systematic uncertainties on the range and rate measurements are 6.1% and 6.4% respectively. Figure 27 shows the measured values of the rate of \u03b4 -ray production and their range as a function of track momentum. Data and simulation are seen to be in good agreement, validating the description of \u03b4 -ray production in the simulation. The rate is expected to decrease with increasing momentum by about 12% over the range studied. While the measurements are consistent with this expectation, the errors are too large to resolve this variation. By integrating equation (6.6), the overall probability of a particle emitting a \u03b4 -ray with a range of more than 40 \u00b5m (half the strip pitch) when traversing a typical silicon thickness of 300 \u00b5m is found to be 1%.",

Typically both sensors and readout electronics are affected, but in the case of single-event upsets only the readout system is impacted. The SCT system was designed to operate for fluences and doses corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 700 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. Up to December 2012 an integrated luminosity of \u223c 29 fb \u22121 had been delivered to the ATLAS experiment, so the effects of radiation on the detectors are expected to be small. However, the large number of SCT modules has allowed robust statistical analyses to be performed. This is particularly true for the detector leakage-current measurements, described in section 7.2, which in turn were used to verify the Monte Carlo fluence predictions. Some degradation effects, such as the change in detector depletion voltage due to radiation-induced impurity states in the silicon, are being observed but are small and still to be studied in detail. Fluence and dose measurements in the inner detector volume were also obtained using a dedicated online radiation monitoring system, described in section 7.3. The particular importance of the radiation monitoring system is to provide ionising-dose information, which is not available from SCT measurements and is important for predicting degradation of the read-out chips.",

The sensor temperature is deduced from the temperature measured by thermistors mounted on the hybrid circuits. For the barrel modules, FEM thermal simulations predict the average sensor temperature to be 3.7\u00b11.0 \u2022 C below the thermistor temperature, and to vary by only \u223c0.2 \u2022 C across the sensor. Predicted temperature differences for the endcap sensors have large uncertainties. Furthermore a systematic difference in the raw leakage current between the two sides A and C exists, the reason for which is currently under investigation. Therefore results are presented below for the barrel only. Figure 29 shows module-by-module distributions of high voltage, hybrid temperature and raw leakage current per module as well as the normalised leakage current per unit volume at 0 \u2022 C for the innermost barrel of the SCT. Periodic increases in raw leakage current, which arise from higher temperatures in one cooling loop, disappear after temperature normalisation, resulting in a distribution which is quite flat along z, a reflection of the flat pseudorapidity distribution of secondary particles in minimum-bias events. Similar flat distributions are seen in all other barrel layers.",

No such restrictions were necessary in 2012. Figure 30 shows the average leakage current of each barrel layer compared with the predictions of the Hamburg/Dortmund model [56,57]. The coloured bands indicate 1\u03c3 uncertainties on the model predictions. They were calculated by varying each parameter of the model by \u00b11\u03c3 and then adding the deviations in quadrature. Uncertainties on temperature measurements (\u00b11 \u2022 C) and delivered luminosities (\u00b13.7%) are also taken into account; the uncertainty on the FLUKA fluence simulations is not included. The Harper model [58] predicts quite similar profiles but with about 15% larger values systematically. The total uncertainties on the model predictions are at the level of \u00b120%. The major uncertainties come from two parameters (k 0I and E I ) in the Hamburg/Dortmund model (see appendix A for details), but from one current-damage constant (A 1 ) with an annealing time of 833 days at \u22127 \u2022 C in the Harper model. For all barrel layers, the data are within the uncertainties of the model predictions over a period of 2.5 years and four orders of magnitude in leakage current. This strongly suggests that the radiation fluences are well described by the FLUKA predictions.",

Details can be found in refs. [60,61] and only a brief description is given here. The radiation-monitor packages provide measurements of non-ionising energy loss (NIEL), total ionising dose (TID) and thermal neutron fluence. NIEL is monitored using p-i-n diodes and two methods are employed. The first measures the increase in the forward voltage for a given forward current and is used for determining NIEL in the fluence range 10 9 to 5 \u2022 10 12 n/cm 2 . This method exploits the increase in silicon resistivity from radiation due to degradation in minority-carrier lifetime. The second method measures the increase in leakage current in a way similar to the SCT silicon sensors. TID is measured with radiation-sensitive p-MOSFET transistors (RadFETs). Ionising radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the silicon oxide; positive charge is trapped in the gate oxide, and an increasing negative gate voltage must be applied for a given drain current. The increase in gate voltage provides a measure of the total ionising dose. The thickness of the oxide layer defines the sensitivity and range of doses that can be measured and different RadFETs are used to cover the required dynamic range. Measurements of TID are of particular interest for predicting degradation of the SCT front--46 - end chips, and the radiation monitors provide the only online information about TID near to the SCT. Thermal neutron fluence is estimated from the decrease in common-emitter-current gain of n-p-n bipolar transistors, which are the same as those used in the SCT read-out chips. The gain in these transistors is degraded due to bulk damage caused by fast hadrons and by thermal neutrons. Since the 1 MeV equivalent fluence of fast hadrons is known from measurements with diodes, the contribution of thermal neutrons can be estimated from the gain degradation [60].",

In particular, the threshold registers use an 8-bit DAC, with the fifth bit usually set to one. When this bit is flipped, the chip outputs the maximum number of strips (128) for each trigger. A few problematic chips which gave spurious SEU-like noise bursts were removed from the analysis.

Another measurable effect of SEUs is the desynchronisation of individual modules from the rest of the ATLAS readout. Triggers are transmitted to the modules via optical links, and testbeam studies have demonstrated that an SEU arising from a relatively small energy deposition in the receiving p-i-n diode can cause a bit flip in a discriminator [64] and may lead to a missing trigger. Desynchronisation is flagged when the trigger count in the ROD differs from the trigger count received from the module, and the mismatch persists until the module is reset. Figure 32b shows the average number of SEUs per module per level-1 trigger in a run versus cluster occupancy for that module in the run. This shows the expected linear trend, confirming that these errors are genuine SEUs. Further confirmation of the SEUs hypothesis comes from the observation that the number of SEUs in a module correlates with decreasing p-i-n diode current, as expected and measured in the test-beam studies [64].",

During this period, more than 99% of detector modules were operational, and more than 99% of data collected by the ATLAS experiment had good SCT data quality. The frequency-scannning interferometry system showed the position of the detector to be stable at the micron level over long periods of time. Measurements of the increase in leakage currents with time are consistent with the radiation-damage predictions. The differences between data and simulation are typically less than 30%. This level of agreement exceeds expectations, and provides confidence in the fluence predictions. The verification of the simulations will be repeated at higher beam energies in future. Single event upsets have been identified and measured in the barrel module data, and a strategy for their mitigation implemented.",

The mean difference in measured Lorentz angle in each layer is taken as a systematic uncertainty correlated among datasets, while the r.m.s. spread of the differences is used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty uncorrelated among datasets. In addition, a fit was performed on cosmic-ray data with no magnetic field; the measured value of the Lorentz angle is compatible with zero, and the precision of this check (0.12 \u2022 ) is included as an additional systematic uncertainty, correlated among all measurements.",
