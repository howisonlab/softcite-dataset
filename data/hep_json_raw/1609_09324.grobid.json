Various strategies are used to suppress effects arising from additional proton-proton interactions, called pileup, concurrent with the hard-scatter processes. Tracking information is used to distinguish contributions from the pileup interactions using their vertex separation along the beam axis. The performance of the E miss T reconstruction algorithms, especially with respect to the amount of pileup, is evaluated using data collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV during 2012, and results are shown for a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The simulation and modelling of E miss T in events containing a Z boson decaying to two charged leptons (electrons or muons) or a W boson decaying to a charged lepton and a neutrino are compared to data. The acceptance for different event topologies, with and without high transverse momentum neutrinos, is shown for a range of threshold criteria for E miss T , and estimates of the systematic uncertainties in the E miss T measurements are presented.",

The E miss T reconstructed with different algorithms is studied in both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and the level of agreement between the two is compared using datasets in which events with a leptonically decaying W or Z boson dominate. The W boson sample provides events with intrinsic E miss T from noninteracting particles (e.g. neutrinos). Contributions to the E miss T due to mismeasurement are referred to as fake E miss T . 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

            "text": "Pileup effects come from two sources: in-time and out-oftime. In-time pileup is the result of multiple pp interactions in the same LHC bunch crossing. It is possible to distinguish the in-time pileup interactions by using their vertex positions, which are spread along the beam axis. At \u03bc = 21, the efficiency to reconstruct and select the correct vertex for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc simulated events is around 93.5% and rises to more than 98% when requiring two generated muons with p T > 10 GeV inside the ID acceptance [10]. When vertices are separated along the beam axis by a distance smaller than the position resolution, they can be reconstructed as a single vertex. Each track in the reconstructed vertex is assigned a weight based upon its compatibility with the fitted vertex, which depends on the \u03c7 2 of the fit. The fraction of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc reconstructed vertices with more than 50% of the sum of track weights coming from pileup interactions is around 3% at \u03bc = 21 [7,10]. Out-of-time pileup comes from pp collisions in earlier and later bunch crossings, which leave signals in the calorimeters that can take up to 450 ns for the charge collection time. This is longer than the 50 ns between subsequent collisions and occurs because the integration time of the calorimeters is significantly larger than the time between the bunch crossings. By contrast the charge collection time of the silicon tracker is less than 25 ns.",

They are produced without neutrinos, apart from a very small number originating from heavy-flavour decays in jets produced in association with the Z boson. The intrinsic E miss T is therefore expected to be close to zero, and the E miss T distributions are used to evaluate the modelling of the effects that give rise to fake E miss T . Candidate Z \u2192 events are required to pass an electron or muon trigger [11,12]. The lowest p T threshold for the unprescaled single-electron (single-muon) trigger is p T > 25 (24) GeV, and both triggers apply a track-based isolation as well as quality selection criteria for the particle identifica-tion. Triggers with higher p T thresholds, without the isolation requirements, are used to improve acceptance at high p T . These triggers require p T > 60 (36) GeV for electrons (muons). Events are accepted if they pass any of the above trigger criteria. Each event must contain at least one primary vertex with a z displacement from the nominal pp interaction point of less than 200 mm and with at least three associated tracks.",

The topological clustering algorithm suppresses noise by forming contiguous clusters of calorimeter cells with significant energy deposits. The local cluster weighting (LCW) [43,44] calibration is used to account for different calorimeter responses to electrons, photons and hadrons. Each cluster is classified as coming from an EM or hadronic shower, using information from its shape and energy density, and calibrated accordingly. The jets are reconstructed from calibrated topoclusters and then corrected for in-time and out-of-time pileup as well as the position of the PV [4]. Finally, the jet energy scale (JES) corrects for jet-level effects by restoring, on average, the energy of reconstructed jets to that of the MC generator-level jets. The complete procedure is referred to as the LCW+JES scheme [43,44]. Without changing the average calibration, additional corrections are made based upon the internal properties of the jet (global sequential calibration) to reduce the flavour dependence and energy leakage effects [44]. Only jets with calibrated p T greater than 20 GeV are used to calculate the jet term E miss,jets x(y) in Eq. 2, and the optimization of the 20 GeV threshold is discussed in Sect. 7.",

The CST is reconstructed using energy deposits in the calorimeter which are not matched to the highp T physics objects used in the E miss T . To avoid fake signals in the calorimeter, noise suppression is important. This is achieved by calculating the soft term using only cells belonging to topoclusters, which are calibrated at the LCW scale [43,44]. The tracker and calorimeter provide redundant p T measurements for charged particles, so an energy-flow algorithm is used to determine which measurement to use.

The increased width in the uncertainty band is asymmetric because many systematic uncertainties increase the E miss T tail in Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events by creating an imbalance in the transverse momentum. The largest of these systematic uncertainties are those associated with the jet energy resolution, the jet energy scale, and pileup. The pileup systematic uncertainties affect mostly the CST and EJAF E miss T , while the jet energy scale uncertainty  intrinsic E miss T , and the systematic uncertainties on the E miss T , especially the soft term, are smaller. Figure 4 shows the soft-term distributions. The pileupsuppressed E miss T algorithms generally have a smaller mean soft term as well as a sharper peak near zero compared to the CST. Among the E miss T algorithms, the soft term from the EJAF algorithm shows the smallest change relative to the CST. The TST has a sharp peak near zero similar to the STVF but with a longer tail, which mostly comes from individual tracks. These tracks are possibly mismeasured and further studies are planned. The simulation under-predicts the TST relative to the observed data between 60-85 GeV, and the differences exceed the assigned systematic uncertainties. This region corresponds to the transition from the narrow core to the tail coming from highp T tracks. The differences between data and simulation could be due to mismodelling of the rate of mismeasured tracks, for which no systematic uncertainty is applied. The mismeasured-track cleaning, as discussed in Sect. 4.1.2, reduces the TST tail starting at 120 GeV, and this region is modelled within the assigned uncertainties. The mismeasured-track cleaning for tracks below 120 GeV and entering the TST is not optimal, and future studies aim to improve this. The E miss T resolution is expected to be proportional to \u221a E T when both quantities are measured with the calorimeter alone [1]. While this proportionality does not hold for tracks, it is nevertheless interesting to understand the modelling of E T and the dependence of E miss T resolution on it. Figure 5 shows the E T distribution for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc data and MC simulation both for the TST and the CST algorithms. The E T is typically larger for the CST algorithm than for the TST because the former includes energy deposits from pileup as well as neutral particles and forward contributions beyond the ID volume. The reduction of pileup contributions in the soft and jet terms leads to the E T (TST) having a sharper peak at around 100 GeV followed by a large tail, due to highp T muons and large p jets T . The data and simulation agree within the uncertainties for the E T (CST) and E T (TST) distributions.",

In the 0-jet sample, the TST and Track E miss T are both primarily reconstructed from tracks; however, small differences arise mostly from accounting for photons in the TST E miss T reconstruction algorithm. The CST E miss T is directly affected by the pileup as its reconstruction does not apply any pileup suppression techniques. Therefore, the CST E miss T has the largest dependence on N PV , with a resolution ranging from 7 GeV at N PV = 2 to around 23 GeV at N PV = 25. The E miss T resolution of the EJAF distribution, while better than that of the CST E miss T , is not as good as that of the other pileup-suppressing algorithms.",

Hence, the evolution  of the E miss T resolution is shown for different numbers of jets in Fig. 8 with the TST E miss T algorithm as a representative example. The jet counting for this figure includes only the jets used by the TST E miss T algorithm, so the JVF criterion discussed in Sect. 4.1.3 is applied. Comparing the 0-jet, 1-jet and \u22652-jet distributions, the resolution is degraded by 4-5 GeV with each additional jet, which is much larger than any dependence on N PV . The inclusive distribution has a larger slope with respect to N PV than the individual jet categories, which indicates that the behaviour seen in the inclusive sample is driven by an increased number of pileup jets included in the E miss T calculation at larger N PV .",

The EJAF E miss T has a better resolution than that of the CST E miss T but does not perform as well as the other reconstruction algorithms. All of the resolution curves have an approximately linear increase with E T (TST); however, the Track E miss T resolution increases sharply starting at E T (TST) = 200 GeV due to missed neutral contributions like photons. The resolution predicted by the simulation is about 5% larger than in data for all E miss T algorithms at E T (TST) = 50 GeV, but agreement improves as E T (TST) increases until around E T (TST) = 200 GeV. Events with jets can end up in the 0-jet event selection, for example, if a jet is misidentified as a hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton. The p \u03c4 T increases with E T (TST), and the rate of jets misreconstructed as hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons is not well modelled by the simulation, which leads to larger E miss T resolution at high E T (TST) than that observed in the data.

In the 0-jet sample, shows the largest bias for p Z T < 60 GeV. The STVF algorithm scales the recoil down globally by the factor \u03b1 STVF as defined in Eq. (11), and this correction decreases the already underestimated soft term. The \u03b1 STVF does increase with p Z T going from 0.06 at p Z T = 0 GeV to around 0.15 at p Z T = 50 GeV, and this results in a rise in the recoil, which approaches the TST E miss T near p Z T \u223c 70 GeV. In Fig. 10b, the inclusive Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events have a significantly underestimated relative recoil for p Z T < 40 GeV. The balance between the R and p Z T improves with p Z T because of an increase in events having highp T calibrated jets recoiling against the Z boson. The presence of jets included in the hard term also reduces the sensitivity to the soft term, which is difficult to measure accurately. The difficulty in isolating effects from soft-term contributions from highp T physics objects is one reason why the soft term is not corrected. As with the 0-jet sample, the CST E miss T has a significantly under-calibrated relative recoil in the lowp Z T region, and all of the other E miss T algorithms have a lower relative recoil than the CST E miss T . Of the pileup-suppressing E miss T algorithms, the TST E miss T is closest to the relative recoil of the CST E miss T . The relative recoil of the Track E miss T is significantly lower than unity because the neutral particles recoiling from the Z boson are not included in its reconstruction.

The difference from zero of the average value of the reconstructed E miss T along p Z T increases as tighter JVF selections are applied as shown in Fig. 18b. Requiring a JVF threshold of 0.25 or higher slightly improves the stability of the resolution with respect to pileup, whereas it visibly degrades the E miss T response by removing too many hard-scatter jets. Lastly, pileup jets with p T > 50 GeV are very rare [4], so applying the JVF requirement above this p T threshold is not useful. Therefore, requiring JVF to be larger than 0.25 for jets with p T < 50 GeV within the tracking volume (|\u03b7| < 2.4) is the preferred threshold for the E miss T reconstruction. In addition, the p T threshold, which defines the boundary between the jet and soft terms, is optimized. For these studies, the jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are required to have JVF > 0.25. A procedure similar to that used for the JVF optimization is used for the jetp T threshold using the same two metrics as shown in Fig. 19.

For the perpendicular component, the simulation is only smeared by a Gaussian function of width \u03c3 \u22a5 to match the data.

The systematic uncertainty squared of the convolved Gaussian width and the systematic uncertainty of the offset for the longitudinal component are shown in the bands. While the systematic uncertainties are applied to the MC simulation, the band is shown centred around the data to show that all MC generators plus parton shower models agree with the data within the assigned uncertainties. Similarly for the E miss,soft \u22a5 , the width of the convolved Gaussian function for the perpendicular component is shown in the band. The Alpgen+Herwig simulation has the largest disagreement with data, so the Gaussian smearing parameters and offsets applied to the simulation are used as the systematic uncertainties in the soft term. The p hard T > 50 GeV bin has the smallest number of data entries; therefore, it has the largest uncertainties in the fitted mean and width. In this bin of the distribution shown in Fig. 23(a), the statistical uncertainty from the Alpgen+Herwig simulation, which is not the most discrepant from data, is added to the uncertainty band, and this results in a systematic uncertainty band that spans the differences in MC generators for \u03c3 2 (E miss,soft ) for events with p hard T > 50 GeV. The impact of uncertainties coming from the parton shower model, the number of jets, \u03bc dependence, JER/JES uncertainties, and forward versus central jet differences was evaluated.

An accurate measurement of the missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) is thus important in many physics analyses to infer the momentum of these particles. However, additional interactions occurring in a given bunch crossing as well as residual signatures from nearby bunch crossings make it difficult to reconstruct the E miss T from the hard-scattering process alone. The E miss T is computed as the negative vector sum of the reconstructed physics objects including electrons, photons, muons, \u03c4 -leptons, and jets. The remaining energy deposits not associated with those highp T physics objects are also considered in the E miss T . They collectively form the so-called soft term, which is the E miss T component most affected by pileup. The calorimeter and the tracker in the ATLAS detector provide complementary information to the reconstruction of the highp T physics objects as well as the E miss T soft term. Charged particles are matched to a particular collision point or vertex, and this information is used to determine which charged particles originated from the hardscatter collision. Thus tracking information can be used to greatly reduce the pileup dependence of the E miss T reconstruction. This has resulted in the development of E miss T reconstruction algorithms that combine the information from the tracker and the calorimeter. The performance of these reconstruction algorithms is evaluated using data from 8 TeV proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 .",

The pileup-suppressed E miss T definitions clearly reduce the dependence on the number of pileup interactions but also introduce a larger under-estimation of the soft term than the CST.",

It has stable E miss T resolution with respect to the amount of pileup; however, it does not have as good a response as the CST E miss T , due mainly to missing neutral particles in the soft term. Nevertheless, its response is better than that of the other reconstruction algorithms that aim to combine the tracking and calorimeter information. For large values of E miss,True T , the CST and TST E miss T algorithms all perform similarly. This is because contributions from jets dominate the E miss T performance, making the differences in soft-term reconstruction less important.",

The EJAF soft-term reconstruction subtracts the pileup contributions to the soft term using a procedure similar to jet area-based pileup corrections, and the EJAF E miss T resolution has a reduced dependence on the amount of pileup, relative to the CST algorithm. The STVF reconstruction algorithm uses an event-level correction of the CST, which is the scalar sum of charged-particle p T from the hard-scatter vertex divided by the scalar sum of all charged-particle p T . The STVF correction to the soft term greatly decreases the dependence of the E miss T resolution on the amount of pileup but causes the largest under-estimation of all the soft-term algorithms.",
