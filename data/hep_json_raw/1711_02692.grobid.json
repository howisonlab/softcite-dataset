            "text": "Inclusive jet production cross-sections have been measured in collisions of hadrons at the SppS and Tevatron colliders at various centre-of-mass energies. The latest and most precise results at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV are detailed in refs. [1,2]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3] at CERN, the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured inclusive jet cross-sections in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [4-6] and \u221a s = 7 TeV [7][8][9][10]. Recently, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured the inclusive jet cross-sections at \u221a s = 8 TeV [11,12], and the CMS Collaboration also at \u221a s = 13 TeV [13]. Dijet production at the LHC has been measured by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV [7,14], and also by the CMS Collaboration at \u221a s = 8 TeV [15]. This paper presents measurements of the inclusive jet and dijet cross-sections in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy by the ATLAS Collaboration at the LHC, using data collected in 2015 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The inclusive jet cross-sections are measured double-differentially as a function of the jet transverse momentum, p T , and absolute jet rapidity, |y|. 1 In addition, the doubledifferential dijet production cross-sections are presented as a function of the invariant mass of the dijet system, m jj , and as a function of half the absolute rapidity separation between the two highest-p T jets satisfying |y| < 3, denoted y * . 2 Jets are reconstructed using the antik t jet clustering algorithm [16] with a radius parameter value of R = 0.4. The measurements cover the kinematic region of 100 GeV < p T < 3.5 TeV and |y| < 3 for the inclusive jet cross-section, and of 300 GeV < m jj < 9 TeV and y * < 3 for the dijet cross-section.",

It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors, surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. They consist of a barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and two endcap (1.375 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. The hadron calorimeters are divided into five distinct regions: a barrel region (|\u03b7| < 0.8), two extended barrel regions (0.8 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 1.7) and two endcap regions (1.5 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 3.2). The barrel and extended barrel regions are instrumented with steel/scintillator tile calorimeters. The endcap regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements. The ATLAS calorimeters have very high lateral granularity and several samplings in depth over |\u03b7| < 3.2. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and features three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers for track measurement in the principal bending direction and fast detectors for triggering and measurement of the muon coordinate in the direction orthogonal to that determined by the precision-tracking chambers. A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by the high-level trigger system [21], which is software-based and can run the offline reconstruction and calibration software, further reducing the event rate to an average of 1 kHz.",

The samples were created using a set of tuned parameters called the A14 tune [30] and the NNPDF2.3LO [31] LO PDF set. The EvtGen 1.2.0 program [32] was used to model bottom and charm hadron decays. NLO samples of simulated events were produced using Powheg [24,33] and showered with Pythia 8 for systematic studies as discussed in section 6.3, and for optimising bin widths. The A14 tune and the CT10 [34] PDF set were used.

The jet area is a measure of the susceptibility of the jet to pile-up and is determined jet by jet, while the average energy density serves as a measure of the pile-up activity and is calculated event by event with k t -jets with a radius parameter value of R = 0.4. After this correction, some dependence of the average jet p T on pile-up activity remains. An additional correction is therefore derived by comparing reconstructed calorimeter jets to particle jets in simulated inclusive jet events. The correction is parameterised as a function of the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing, \u00b5, and the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event, N PV , such that both the out-of-time and in-time effects are taken into account.",

Noise from the calorimeter electronics and pile-up forms a significant component of the JER at low p T . A study in zero-bias data 5 allows this contribution to be constrained.

The matching efficiency, E i , is defined as the fraction of particle level jets that are matched to a reconstruction level jet for a given p T bin i. If matched particle and reconstructed jets are in different rapidity bins then they are reassigned as being unmatched. For dijets, the efficiency (purity) is defined as the fraction of events passing the selection cuts at the particle (reconstruction) level for a given y * bin that also pass the selection cuts and lie in the same y * bin at the reconstruction (particle) level. In this way the migrations across jet |y| and dijet y * bins are effectively taken into account by bin-to-bin corrections. The jet matching efficiency is 98% (96%) at p T = 100 GeV for low (high) jet rapidity, and reaches 99.7% at high p T . The event dijet efficiency is 97% (85%) at m jj = 300 GeV (m jj = 1700 GeV) for low (high) y * , and reaches 99.7% at the highest dijet mass.",

In addition to the statistical uncertainties on the calculations, which are larger for higher p T and high rapidities, two sources of uncertainty are considered in this NNLO calculation: the scale uncertainty and the systematic uncertainty in the non-perturbative correction. To obtain the scale uncertainty, both scales (renormalisation and factorisation) are varied simultaneously by a factor of 0.5 or 2. 6 If both variations yield changes with the same sign, the scale uncertainty is obtained from the larger change.

Comparable results are obtained for PDF sets determined with similar data. Strong tension between data and theory is observed when considering data points from all jet transverse momentum and rapidity regions in the inclusive jet measurement (table 3) Consideration of all data points together requires a good understanding of the correlations of the experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties in jet p T and rapidity. Although the correlations of most uncertainties are generally well known, the systematic uncertainties that are based on simple comparisons between two options (two-point uncertainties) are not well defined. This is the case for instance for the in situ multijet balance uncertainties due to different fragmentation models and the theoretical uncertainty related to the alternative scale choice. In these cases, alternative decorrelation scenarios can in principle be used instead of the default full correlation model. In these, systematic uncertainties are split into sub-components whose size varies with jet rapidity and p T , keeping their sum in quadrature equal to the original uncertainty.",

Decorrelation scenarios were applied simultaneously to the largest sources of two-point experimental uncertainties (the JES flavour response, the JES multijet p T -balance fragmentation, and the pile-up energy density in jets) as well as the theoretical uncertainties (the scale variations, the alternative scale choice and the non-perturbative corrections) using the splitting options that yielded the largest \u03c7 2 reduction for each single component in ref.

The \u03c7 2 using the CT14 PDF set and the p max T scale choice is found to be reduced by 58 units (\u03c7 2 /dof = 361/177) compared to the nominal configuration, but the corresponding p-value is still 10 \u22123 , in agreement with the conclusions of the previous ATLAS measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV [11].",

A quantitative comparison of the measurements to fixed-order NLO QCD calculations, corrected for non-perturbative and electroweak effects, shows overall fair agreement (with p-values in the percent range) when considering jet cross-sections in individual jet rapidity bins independently. In the inclusive jet measurement, a significant tension (with p-values 10 \u22123 ) between data and theory is observed when considering data points from all jet transverse momentum and rapidity regions.

This quantity is invariant under a Lorentz boost along the z-direction and is equal to the absolute rapidity of each jet in the dijet rest frame.3 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).",
