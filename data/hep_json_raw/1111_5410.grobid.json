Data collected in 2010, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.14 pb \u22121 , is used for the measurements. Jets in the transverse momentum range p T = 35 -140 GeV/c are reconstructed with the anti-k T (R = 0.5) algorithm. The extended coverage of large pseudo-rapidities is provided by the Hadronic Forward calorimeter (3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.7), while central jets are limited to |\u03b7| < 2.8, covered by the main detector components. The two differential cross sections are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum. Comparisons to next-to-leading order perturbative calculations, and predictions from event generators based on different parton showering mechanisms (PYTHIA and HERWIG) and parton dynamics (CASCADE) are shown.",

            "text": "Jet production in hadron-hadron collisions is sensitive to underlying partonic processes, initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR), and to the parton density functions (PDFs) of the colliding hadrons. Measurements of jet cross sections at previous colliders are well described over several orders of magnitude by perturbative calculations [1]  [2]. However, the jets were limited to central pseudo-rapidities (|\u03b7| <2.4), where the momentum fraction of the incoming partons (x 1 , x 2 ) were of the same order. Jets at large pseudo-rapidities (i.e., forward or backward jets, |\u03b7| >3 ) result from interactions between colliding partons with differing momentum fractions (e.g. x 1 << x 2 ), allowing us to investigate QCD-effects at small-x. At such small-x values, PDFs are well constrained by DIS data, but there might be additional effects that play a role. We expect signals of parton dynamics beyond the standard DGLAP evolution (e.g., BFKL or CCFM), and saturation effects are foreseen. Moreover, forward jets are of interest in vector-boson-fusion processes, which is one of the mechanisms for Higgs boson production.",

At the collider, momentum fraction of the proton (x) carried by the partons can become very small and the parton densities become large. Additionally, the probability of more than one partonic interaction per event increases for collision energies produced at the LHC, and probing the forward region opens up opens up a large phase space for QCD emissions. Thus, the LHC provides the perfect opportunity to study small-x physics and QCD effects through measurements of forward and forward-central jet production. Here, a measurement of the cross section of inclusive forward jets [3] and of the production of a forward jet in conjunction with a central jet [4], using data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), in \u221a s = 7 TeV pp-collisions at the LHC is presented.",
