The relevant processes, especially multiparton interactions (MPI) and the fragmentation of the beam remnants, are modelled phenomenologically in Monte Carlo event generators with parameters tuned from data [1,2]. A good understanding of forward particle production is important to accurately simulate the interactions of cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere as well as the subsequent development of extensive air showers [3]. In addition, the production of forward charged hadrons has a direct impact on the total number of air-shower muons at the ground, whose model predictions still show a deficiency compared to the data [4].",

The CAS-TOR calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter composed of layers of fused silica quartz plates and tungsten absorbers. It is located only on the negative side of CMS and covers the pseudorapidity region \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2. The two front channels of each azimuthal segment (so called tower), have a combined depth of 20 radiation lengths and form the electromagnetic section of each tower. The energy recorded in these channels is dominated by energy deposits of electrons and photons, which include photons from neutral pion decays. The remaining 12 channels of each tower constitute the hadronic section. The full depth of a tower amounts to 10 hadronic interaction lengths. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in Ref. [5]. A detailed description of the CASTOR calorimeter is given in Refs. [6,7]. * e-mail: Sebastian.Baur@kit.edu",

At \u221a s = 0.9 GeV, the energy seen by CASTOR decreases as the central jet p T increases. This is due to the fact that the energy is dominated by the fragmentation of the beam remnant and that more energy is taken from the remnant as the central activity increases. With increasing centre-of-mass energy, the contribution of MPI becomes more and more important to the energy in the CASTOR acceptance. The typical behaviour of the underlying event is seen at \u221a s = 7 TeV, where a sharp rise, followed by a plateau region is observed. If MPI is turned off in Pythia6 [14], the forward energy becomes independent of the central jet p T , which is ruled out by the data. The most studied event generators perform well in describing the general features of the data, although none describes all features at once. ",

This can be a hint of a too large elasticity in the model. The separation into the electromagnetic and hadronic contribution provides additional constraints for the models. While the electromagnetic energy spectrum is well described by the latest generation of interaction models, the hadronic energy is slightly overestimated at the edge of the uncertainties.
