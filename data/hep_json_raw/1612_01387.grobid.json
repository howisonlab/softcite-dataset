Its first phase (DAMA/LIBRA-phase1) and the former DAMA/NaI experiment (\u223c 100 kg of highly radio-pure NaI(Tl)) collected data for 14 independent annual cycles, exploiting the model-independent Dark Matter (DM) annual modulation signature (total exposure 1.33 ton \u00d7 yr). A DM annual modulation effect has been observed at 9.3 \u03c3 C.L., supporting the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo. No systematic or side reaction able to mimic the observed DM annual modulation has been found or suggested by anyone. Recent analyses on possible diurnal effects, on the Earth shadowing effect and on possible interpretation in terms of Asymmetric Mirror DM will be mentioned. At present DAMA/LIBRA is running in its phase2 with increased sensitivity.",

            "text": "Because of the Earth's revolution around the Sun, which is moving in the Galaxy, the flux of DM particles impinging a terrestrial detector is expected to be maximum around 2 nd June when the projection of the Earth orbital velocity on the Sun velocity with respect to the Galactic frame is maximum, and minimum around December 2 nd when the two velocities are opposite. This effect, known as DM annual modulation signature, is very effective because the signal induced by DM particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements: the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function (1) with one year period (2) and a phase peaked roughly at 2 nd June (3); the modulation must only be present in a well-defined low energy range (4); it must a also Dip. di Ingegneria Civile e Ingegneria Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", I-00133 Rome, Italy b also University of Jinggangshan, Jiangxi, China apply only to those events in which just one detector among many actually \"fires\" (single-hit events), since the DM particle multi-interaction probability is negligible (5); the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be 7% for usually adopted halo distributions (6), but it can be larger (even up to 30%) in case of some possible scenarios (see for example Ref. [20][21][22][23][24]). This signature is model independent and might be mimicked only by systematic effects or side reactions able to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements given above; no one is available [1-4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 25]. The full description of the DAMA/LIBRA set-up and performance during the phase1 and phase2 (presently running) and other related arguments have been discussed in details in Refs.

            "text": "The data of DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 and of DAMA/NaI experiment correspond to an exposure of 1.33 ton \u00d7 yr collected in 14 annual cycles. In order to investigate the presence of annual modulation with proper features, many analyses have been carried out. All these analyses point out the presence of annual modulation satisfying all the requirements of the signature [2][3][4]8]. In Fig. 1, as example, the time behaviour of the experimental residual rate of the single-hit scintillation events for DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 in the (2-6) keV energy interva is plotted. When fitting the singlehit residual rate of DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 together with the DAMA/NaI ones, with the function: A cos \u03c9(t \u2212 t 0 ), considering a period T = 2\u03c0 \u03c9 = 1 yr and a phase t 0 = 152.5 day (2 nd June) as expected by the DM annual modulation signature, the following modulation amplitude in NaI(Tl) is obtained: A = (0.0110 \u00b1 0.0012) cpd/kg/keV, corresponding to 9.2 \u03c3 C.L.. When the period, and the phase are kept free in the fitting procedure, the modulation amplitude is (0.0112 \u00b1 0.0012) cpd/kg/keV (9.3 \u03c3 C.L.), the period T = (0.998 \u00b1 0.002) year and the phase t 0 = (144 \u00b1 7) day, values well in agreement with expectations for a DM annual modulation signal. In particular, the phase is consistent with about 2 nd June and is fully consistent with the value independently determined by Maximum Likelihood analysis [4]. The run test and the \u03c7 2 test on the data have shown that the modulation amplitudes singularly calculated for each annual cycle of DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 are normally fluctuating around their best fit values [2][3][4].",

[2,5,8,12,[14][15][16][17][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] and references therein. Further large literature is available on the topics (see for example Ref. [41]).

Moreover, scenarios also exist for which the DAMA approach is favoured.",

In particular the interest in this signature is also that the ratio R dy of this DM diurnal modulation amplitude over the DM annual modulation amplitude is a model independent constant at given latitude; considering the LNGS latitude, R dy = S d S m 0.016. Thus, taking into account the DM annual modulation effect pointed out by DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 for single-hit events in the low energy region, the expected value of the diurnal modulation amplitude for the (2-6) keV energy interval is 1.5\u00d7 10 \u22124 cpd/kg/keV. Fig. 2 shows the time behaviour of the experimental residual rates of single-hit events both as a function of solar (le f t) and of sidereal (right) time, in the (2-6) keV interval [12].",

The induced effect should be a daily variation of their velocity distribution, and therefore of the signal rate measured deep underground. However, this effect is very small and would be appreciable only in case of high cross-section spin independent coupled candidates. Such candidates must constitute a little fraction (\u03be) of the Galactic dark halo in order to fulfil the positive DAMA result on annual modulation. By the fact, this analysis decouples \u03be from \u03c3 n . Considering the measured DM annual modulation effect and the absence -at the present level of sensitivity -of diurnal effects, the analysis selects allowed regions in the three-dimensional space: \u03be, \u03c3 n and DM particle mass in some model scenarios; for details see Ref.

In this case, the mirror world becomes a heavier and deformed copy of our world, with mirror particle masses scaled in different ways with respect to the masses of the ordinary particles.
