In addition, the tracks must form a high-quality vertex and the scalar sum of their transverse momenta must exceed 1.8 GeV/c. The pion and kaon candidates are also required to satisfy loose particle identification (PID) criteria to reduce the contribution to the selected sample from misidentified particles. Charm-meson candidates must have an invariant mass within \u00b125 MeV/c 2 of their known value [33]. Using the same method as in Ref.

The tighter decay-time significance criterion on the D + eliminates background from B + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays where the negatively charged pion is misidentified as a kaon.",

            "text": "Systematic uncertainties that affect the normalisation are listed in Table 5 and are described below. The limited size of the simulated signal samples affects the normalisation as well as the statistical uncertainties of the B + yields. The systematic uncertainties of the B + yields are evaluated by varying the signal shape according to the covariance matrix of the fit to simulated data and by changing the signal model to the sum of two Gaussian functions. The B + yield is also affected by uncertainties on the background, which are evaluated by changing the background shape to an exponential function and by varying the single-charm background by 100% of its yield. The impact on the efficiency ratio of the uncertainty on the B + c lifetime is evaluated by changing its lifetime by one standard deviation. Imperfections in the rescaling of the PID variables [22] are quantified by considering the efficiency ratio with and without PID corrections and assigning the difference as a systematic uncertainty. The D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay has a complicated substructure, but was simulated according to a phase-space model. The systematic uncertainty is taken as the quadratic sum of the differences in efficiency ratio when the simulated events are weighted to reproduce the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant-mass distributions observed in data. The difference in efficiency when applying the model variations for B + c decays with one or two excited charm mesons in the final state is taken into account as a systematic uncertainty. The determinations of the B + c \u2192 D * + ( ) D * 0 branching fraction ratios are corrected for B(D * + \u2192 D + \u03c0 0 , \u03b3 ) = (32.3 \u00b1 0.5)% [33], as is indicated in Eq. (3), and the corresponding uncertainty is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.",

Four distinct classifiers are constructed: the BDT training is performed separately for the states and for the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay channels. For a given D 0 final state, the same classifier is used for both B + c \u2192 D + (s) D 0 and B + c \u2192 D + (s) D 0 decays. For signal, the BDT is trained using simulated B + c events, while for background data in the range 5350 < m(D + (s) ( ) D 0 ) < 6200 MeV/c 2 are used. Studies indicate that the combinatorial background is dominated by non-charm and single-charm candidates, while combinations of two real charm mesons contribute less than 5%. To increase the size of the background sample for the BDT training, the charm mass windows are increased from \u00b125 MeV/c 2 to \u00b175 MeV/c 2 .",
