This note describes a new analysis tool devised to handle this situation in cases when such bosons decay to a pair of \u03c4 -leptons. The tool reconstructs the rest frame of the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair by finding the boost that minimises the acollinearity between the visible \u03c4 decay products. In most cases this gives a reasonable approximation to the rest frame of the decaying boson. It is shown how the reconstructed rest frame allows for a new method of mass estimation. Also a considerable gain in sensitivity to helicity correlations is obtained by analysing the \u03c4 -jets in the reconstructed frame instead of using the laboratory momenta and energies, particularly when both \u03c4 -leptons decay hadronically.",

While experimental data exclude Standard Model Higgs, H, masses below 114.4 GeV/c 2 , the lightest neutral supersymmetric Higgs can have a mass as low as 92.8 GeV/c 2 [1], which is very close to the mass of the Z 0 . In the mass range below 160 GeV/c 2 the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay mode is of particular importance in searches for neutral H, as demonstrated in Tevatron searches [2]. In this mass region, H production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at LHC energies is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion [3], and a search for gg \u2192 H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 production at the LHC is very important, as emphasised in [4].",

A method correcting for this is the so called collinear approximation [6]. This method assumes the neutrinos are collinear with the decaying \u03c4 -lepton, and includes / E T by projecting it to the \u03c4 -jets. However, this projection is only possible and reliable in a fraction of events with large transverse boost and well aligned / E T [10,11]. In [7] the performance of a likelihood based technique is presented for simulations of Higgs and Z 0 events in antiproton-proton collisions at 1.96 TeV, and also for data collected by the CDF experiment. For fully hadronic decaying tau-leptons, unsmeared simulations show a mass reconstruction resolution of 8%, and more realistic simulation shows a mass resolution of 14%, and finally the CDF Z 0 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events show a resolution of 16% with this technique. The smeared results are obtained for events within |\u03b7| < 1, smearing of hadron momenta of 10% and of / E T of 5 GeV in each of the transverse components. At the LHC the events are much more boosted, and the experiments have larger \u03b7 coverage. In [12], CMS expects a likelihood mass resolution of 21% for a 130 GeV Higgs (for leptonic and semi-leptonic \u03c4 -decays), in an analysis covering |\u03b7| < 2.3 for hadronic \u03c4 decays. This is approaching the width of the the M vis distribution which is reported to be 24%. A possible explanation for the poorer resolution in CMS could be that / E T measures a smaller fraction of the full neutrino energies for \u03c4 -jets with large \u03b7 than for transverse ones. Hence, estimates of the full neutrino energies from / E T arises from correspondingly larger scale factors.",

The mass of a particle decaying to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 could be inferred by determining the kinematic endpoint of the distribution of twice the leading \u03c4 -jet energy in the boson RF. This quantity will henceforth be named as 2E 1 RF . As opposed to the collinear approximation this quantity can be calculated for all events. In figure 4 distributions of 2E 1 RF are compared to M vis distributions. This way of estimating the mass becomes particularly useful when both \u03c4 -leptons decay into hadrons, where only one neutrino is present in each \u03c4 decay. Figure 4 suggests that a first guess to the shape of 2E 1 RF could be a triangle convoluted with some resolution function, although it is clear that the inclusion of effects like the Z 0 /H width and helicity effects modifies such an assumption. Still the kinematic edge can be found be determining the point of steepest slopes of the distribution.   RF calculated using the XYZ-method and invariant mass of the visible \u03c4 -jets, M vis , for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pairs both decaying to single charged hadrons. The dotted line marks the position of the steepest slope for the 2E 1 RF distribution. Figure 4 is the result for all hadronic decaying events without any selection. As mentioned earlier, the decision on which boost reconstruction method to use should depend on the magnitude of the transverse boost. Therefore, the events have been divided into two classes; one with a large difference in azimuthal angle between the two jets, \u2206\u03c6 jets , compatible with no transverse boost, where the Z-method were used, and one with the rest of the event where the XYZ-method were applied. Here a threshold of \u2206\u03c6 jets = 170 \u2022 were chosen to separate the two classes. The criterion for the choice of boosting method would have to be subject to study in a true experimental environment. Furthermore, a cut of 10 GeV on the p T for both \u03c4 -jets were applied to both classes. In figure 5, it is shown that 24% of the Z 0 -boson and 16% of the Higgs events can be reasonably subjected to the Z-method. Hence, without any use of / E T an approximation of the centre of mass system is still available of these events.",

This technique does not introduce assumptions on transfer functions or production mechanisms of the heavy particle as more elaborate reconstruction techniques, and it can be applied to all events within the geometrical acceptance of the experiments. The method is complementary to existing methods in the sense that it can be applied without using information on the measured / E T , and since it is not directly correlated with the visible mass it adds information, and thus the two can be combined to gain further sensitivity.",

Both boost methods presented enhance sensitivity to spin when compared to an analysis in the laboratory frame.
