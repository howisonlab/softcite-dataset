            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle. Due to its Yukawa coupling being close to unity, it is often believed to play a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking. Its presence in virtual loops relates the top quark mass m t with the one of the Higgs boson. Many models for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) predict new particles which decay predominantly into top quarks (e.g. Super-Symmetry, SUSY), and new particles may also be produced in top decays. For these reasons, it is important to study the top quark in great detail, in order to check the consistency of the SM, and to look for contributions from new physics.",

The focus of this article lies with the latest experimental measurements of the inclusive and di\u21b5erential cross section for the production of tt pairs. Other properties of the top quark and its interactions are discussed in Refs. [3][4][5][6][7], while the theory status is presented in Refs. [8,9].",

The result [25], shown in Fig. 3, corresponds to the first \u21b5 s determination from top quark events. Its precision is already comparable to the one obtained using jet rates in hadron collisions. The lower \u21b5 s values obtained with the theory calculation obtained with HATHOR [26,27] compared with the one using TOP++ [10,28,29] are due to the larger value of the predicted tt . ",

The results were compared with various LO or NLO MC generators, interfaced with parton showers (see Fig. 7). In the central rapidity region (|y| < 0.8), MC@NLO overestimates the gap fraction, corresponding to too few jets being produced. Other MC models such as POWHEG, SHERPA or ALPGEN are in better agreement with the data. Comparisons with models where parameters which control the QCD radiation, such as ISR/FSR settings, the Q 2 scale or the matching threshold between the matrix element and 04001-p.3  the parton shower, are varied, were also performed.
