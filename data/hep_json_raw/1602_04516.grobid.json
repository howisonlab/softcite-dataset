The analysis exploits the decay mode of the Higgs boson into a pair of \u03c4 leptons and is based on 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described in an effective field theory framework, in which the strength of CP violation is governed by a single parameterd. The mean values and distributions of CP-odd observables agree with the expectation in the Standard Model and show no sign of CP violation. The CP-mixing parameterd is constrained to the interval (\u22120.11, 0.05) at 68% confidence level, consistent with the Standard Model expectation ofd = 0.",

C and CP violation is one of the three Sakharov conditions [4][5][6] needed to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. In the SM with massless neutrinos the only source of CP violation is the complex phase in the quark mixing (CKM) matrix [7,8]. The measured size of the complex phase and the derived magnitude of CP violation in the early universe is insufficient to explain the observed value of the baryon asymmetry [9] within the SM [10,11] and, most probably, new sources of CP violation beyond the SM need to be introduced. No observable effect of CP violation is expected in the production or decay of the SM Higgs boson. Hence any observation of CP violation involving the observed Higgs boson would be an unequivocal sign of physics beyond the SM.",

A CP-odd Optimal Observable [17][18][19] is employed. The Optimal Observable combines the information from the multi-dimensional phase space in a single quantity calculated from leadingorder matrix elements for VBF production. Hence it does not depend on the decay mode of the Higgs boson. A direct test of CP invariance is possible measuring the mean value of the CP-odd Optimal Observable. Moreover, as described in Sect. 2, an ansatz in the framework of an effective field theory is utilised, in which all CP-violating effects corresponding to operators with dimensions up to six in the couplings between a Higgs boson and an electroweak gauge boson can be described in terms of a single parameterd. Limits ond are derived by analysing the shape of spectra of the Optimal Observable measured in H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 candidate events that also have two jets tagging VBF production. The event selection, estimation of background contributions and of systematic uncertainties follows the analysis used to establish 4.5\u03c3 evidence for the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay [20]. Only events selected in the VBF category are analysed, and only fully leptonic \u03c4 lep \u03c4 lep or semileptonic \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had decays of the \u03c4 -lepton pair are considered.",

If CP invariance holds, the mean value has to vanish O CP = 0. An observation of a nonvanishing mean value would be a clear sign of CP violation. A simple CP-odd observable for Higgs boson production in VBF, the \"signed\" difference in the azimuthal angle between the two tagging jets \u03c6 j j , was suggested in Ref. [22] and is formally defined as: The final state consisting of the Higgs boson and the two tagging jets can be characterised by seven phase-space variables while assuming the mass of the Higgs boson, neglecting jet masses and exploiting momentum conservation in the plane transverse to the beam line. The concept of the Optimal Observable combines the information of the highdimensional phase space in a single observable, which can be shown to have the highest sensitivity for small values of the parameter of interest and neglects contributions proportional tod 2 in the matrix element. The method was first suggested for the estimation of a single parameter using the mean value only [17] and via a maximum-likelihood fit to the full distribution [18] using the so-called Optimal Observable of first order. The extension to several parameters and also exploiting the matrix-element contributions quadratic in the parameters by adding an Optimal Observable of second order was introduced in Refs. [19,27,28]. The technique has been applied in various experimental analyses, e.g. Refs. [15,[29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39].",

It is defined as the ratio of the interference term in the matrix element to the SM contribution: Figure 1 shows the distribution of the Optimal Observable, at parton level both for the SM case and for two non-zerod values, which introduce an asymmetry into the distribution and yield a non-vanishing mean value. The values of the leading-order matrix elements needed for the calculation of the Optimal Observable are extracted from HAWK [41][42][43]. The evaluation requires the fourmomenta of the Higgs boson and the two tagging jets. The momentum fraction x 1 (x 2 ) of the initial-state parton from the proton moving in the positive (negative) z-direction can be derived by exploiting energy-momentum conservation from  Fig. 1 Distribution of the Optimal Observable at parton-level for two arbitraryd values. The SM sample was generated using Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO [40] (see Sect. 5) at leading order, and then reweighted to differentd values.

            "text": "In the case of VBF-produced Higgs boson events in the presence of anomalous couplings in the H V V vertex, the simulated samples are obtained by applying a matrix element (ME) reweighting method to the VBF SM signal sample. The weight is defined as the ratio of the squared ME value for the VBF process associated with a specific amount of CP mixing (measured in terms ofd) to the SM one. The inputs needed for the ME evaluation are the flavour of the incoming partons, the four-momenta and the flavour of the two or three final-state partons and the four-momentum of the Higgs boson. The Bjorken x values of the initial-state partons can be calculated from energy-momentum conservation. The leading-order ME from HAWK [41][42][43] is used for the 2 \u2192 2 + H or 2 \u2192 3 + H process separately. This reweighting procedure is validated against samples generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [40]. As described in Ref. [89], MadGraph5_aMC@NLO can simulate VBF production with anomalous couplings at next-to-leading order. The reweighting procedure proves to be a good approximation to a full next-to-Leading description of the BSM process. In the case of the H \u2192 W W sample, if CP violation exists in the H V V coupling, it would affect both the VBF production and the H W W decay vertex. It was verified that the shape of the Optimal Observable distribution is independent of any possible CP violation in the H \u2192 W W decay vertex and that it is identical for H \u2192 W W and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays. Hence the same reweighting is applied for VBF-produced events with H \u2192 W W and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decays.",

These regions are also used to normalise the respective background estimates using a global fit described in the next section. Finally, an additional region is defined for each channel, called the low-BDT score control region, where a background-dominated region orthogonal to the signal region is selected by requiring the BDT score to be less than 0.05 for \u03c4 lep \u03c4 lep and less than 0.3 for \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had . The distribution of the Optimal Observable in these regions is shown in Figs. 3 and 4, demonstrating the good description of the data by the background estimates.",

This is obtained from the small difference between the Optimal Observable distribution in reweighted samples, compared to samples with anomalous couplings directly generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. While the analysis is statistically limited, the most important systematic uncertainties are found to arise from effects on the jet, hadronically decaying \u03c4 and electron energy scales; the most important theoretical uncertainty is due to the description of the underlying event and parton shower in the VBF signal sample.   , \u03b8 ) is employed, which is a function of the data x, the free-floating signal strength \u03bc, defined as the ratio of the measured cross section times branching ratio to the Standard Model prediction, and further nuisance parameters \u03b8 . It relies on an underlying model of signal plus background, and it is defined as the product of Poisson probability terms for each bin in the distribution of the Optimal Observable. A set of signal templates corresponding to different values of the CP-mixing parameterd is created by reweighting the SM VBF H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and H \u2192 W W signal samples, as described in Sect. 5. The likelihood function is then evaluated for eachd hypothesis using the corresponding signal template, while keeping the same background model. The calculation profiles the nuisance parameters to the best-fit values\u03b8, including information about systematic uncertainties and normalisation fac-tors, both of which affect the expected numbers of signal and background events.",
