No lepton pairs with an invariant mass greater than 12 GeV are observed, consistent with the background expectations derived from data. The detection efficiencies for generic resonances with lifetimes (c\u03c4 ) of 100-1000 mm decaying into a dilepton pair with masses between 0.1-1.0 TeV are presented as a function of p T and decay radius of the resonances to allow the extraction of upper limits on the cross sections for theoretical models. The result is also interpreted in a supersymmetric model in which the lightest neutralino, produced via squark-antisquark production, decays into + \u2212 \u03bd ( , = e, \u03bc) with a finite lifetime due to the presence of R-parity violating couplings.",

The matrixelement calculation was performed at the tree level and included the emission of up to two additional partons. The merging of matrix elements and parton showers was done with the CKKW-L algorithm [30], with a matching scale set to one quarter of the squark mass. The cross-sections in the SUSY model were calculated to approximate, next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (approximate NNLO+NNLL) [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]. The nominal cross-section and its uncertainty were derived using the PDF4LHC15_mc PDF set, following the recommendations of Ref. [39]. The samples span four hypotheses for the squark and the LSP masses and mean proper lifetimes corresponding to c\u03c4 = 10-1000 mm. Instead of producing MC samples for each of the two scenarios separately, combined samples were produced in which the LSP decays into the three final states (ee\u03bd, e\u03bc\u03bd and \u03bc\u03bc\u03bd) at the same rate. The events were reweighted to match the chosen \u03bb coupling.",

The selected ID tracks are used to find two-track seed vertices. The vertex tracks are not allowed to have hits in pixel layers at radii smaller than the seed vertex, and are required to have a hit in the nearest pixel or SCT layer at larger radius. Multi-track DVs are formed iteratively using the collection of seed vertices. In this process, DVs that are close to each other are merged and poorly associated tracks are removed from DVs to ensure that each selected track is assigned to only one DV [53]. The performance and uncertainties associated to the LRT and vertexing are studied with reconstructed K 0 S , as described in Section 6.",

The upper limits on the production cross-section of the RPV SUSY model are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for a 700 GeV squark and a 1.6 TeV squark, respectively. The observed limits are consistent with the expected limits within the uncertainties. Mean proper neutralino lifetimes which correspond to c\u03c4 between 1 mm and 6 m are excluded for a 700 GeV squark. If the squark mass is much higher, 1.6 TeV, the excluded c\u03c4 region is 3 mm to 1 m for a 1300 GeV neutralino, while the c\u03c4 of a 50 GeV neutralino can be constrained only in the \u03bb 122 scenario, where c\u03c4 values between 4 and 30 mm are excluded.",
