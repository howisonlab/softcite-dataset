            "text": "Results are presented from a search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in pp collisions in final states with two \u03c4 leptons. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity between 18.1 fb \u22121 and 19.6 fb \u22121 depending on the final state of \u03c4 lepton decays, at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted using simplified models describing the pair production and decays of charginos or \u03c4 sleptons. For models describing the pair production of the lightest chargino, exclusion regions are obtained in the plane of chargino mass vs. neutralino mass under the following assumptions: the chargino decays into third-generation sleptons, which are taken to be the lightest sleptons, and the sleptons masses lie midway between those of the chargino and the neutralino. Chargino masses below 420 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level in the limit of a massless neutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the cross section for pair production of \u03c4 sleptons as a function of mass, assuming a massless neutralino.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5] is one of the most promising extensions of the standard model (SM) of elementary particles. Certain classes of SUSY models can lead to the unification of gauge couplings at high energy, provide a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem without fine tuning by stabilizing the mass of the Higgs boson against large radiative corrections, and provide a stable dark matter candidate in models with conservation of R-parity. A key prediction of SUSY is the existence of new particles with the same gauge quantum numbers as SM particles but differing by a half-unit in spin (sparticles). Extensive searches at the LHC have excluded the existence of strongly produced (colored) sparticles in a broad range of scenarios, with lower limits on sparticle masses ranging up to 1.8 TeV for gluino pair production [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. While the limits do depend on the details -1 -JHEP04(2017)018 Figure 1.

In various SUSY models, the lightest SUSY partners of the SM leptons are those of the third generation, resulting in enhanced branching fractions for final states with \u03c4 leptons [21]. The previous searches for charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons by the CMS Collaboration either did not include the possibility that the scalar \u03c4 lepton and its neutral partner ( \u03c4 and \u03bd \u03c4 ) are the lightest sleptons [16], or that the initial charginos and neutralinos are produced in vector-boson fusion processes [18]. An ATLAS search for SUSY in the di-\u03c4 channel is reported in ref. [19], excluding chargino masses up to 345 GeV for a massless neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ). The ATLAS results on direct \u03c4 production is improved and updated in ref. [20].",

This search makes use of the stransverse mass variable (M T2 ) [24,25], which is the extension of transverse mass (M T ) to the case where two massive particles with equal mass are created in pairs and decay to two invisible and two visible particles. In the case of this search, the visible particles are both \u03c4 leptons. The distribution of M T2 reflects the scale of the produced particles and has a longer tail for heavy sparticles compared to lighter SM particles. Hence, SUSY can manifest itself as an excess of events in the high-side tail of the M T2 distribution. Final states are considered where two \u03c4 leptons are each reconstructed via hadronic decays (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h ), or where only one \u03c4 lepton decays hadronically and the other decays leptonically ( \u03c4 h , where is an electron or muon).",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [26].",

Jets are reconstructed from the PF candidates with the anti-k t clustering algorithm [30] using a distance parameter of 0.5. We apply corrections dependent on transverse momentum (p T ) and pseudorapidity (\u03b7) to account for residual effects of nonuniform detector response [31]. A correction to account for multiple pp collisions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup interactions) is estimated on an event-by-event basis using the jet area method described in ref. [32], and is applied to the reconstructed jet p T . The combined secondary vertex algorithm [33] is used to identify (\"b tag\") jets originating from b quarks. This algorithm is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices, together with track-based lifetime information. In this analysis a working point is chosen such that, for jets with a p T value greater than 60 GeV the efficiency for tagging a jet containing a b quark is 70% with a light-parton jet misidentification rate of 1.5%, and c quark jet misidentification rate of 20%. Scale factors are applied to the simulated events to reproduce the tagging efficiencies measured in data, separately for jets originating from b or c quarks, and from light-flavor partons. Jets with p T > 40 GeV and |\u03b7| < 5.0 and b-tagged jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered in this analysis.",

The constituents of the reconstructed jets are used to identify individual \u03c4 lepton decay modes with one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions, or three charged hadrons. Additional discriminators are used to separate \u03c4 h from electrons and muons. Prompt \u03c4 leptons are expected to be isolated in the detector. To discriminate them from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) jets, an isolation variable [35] is defined by the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the charged hadrons and photons falling within a cone around the \u03c4 lepton momentum direction after correcting for the effect of pileup. The \"loose\", \"medium\", and \"tight\" working points are defined by requiring the value of the isolation variable not to exceed 2.0, 1.0, and 0.8 GeV, respectively. A similar measure of isolation is computed for charged leptons (e or \u00b5), where the isolation variable is divided by the p T of the lepton.

The daughter sparticle in the two-body decay of the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 can be either a \u03c4 or \u03bd \u03c4 . In this scenario, no decay modes are considered other than those shown in figure 1 (left), so for m( \u03c4 ) = m( \u03bd \u03c4 ), the two decay chains (via the \u03c4 or \u03bd \u03c4 ) have 50% branching fraction. The masses of the \u03c4 and \u03bd \u03c4 are set to be equal to the mean value of the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 1 masses and consequently are produced on mass shell. If the \u03c4 ( \u03bd \u03c4 ) mass is close to the \u03c7 0 1 mass, the \u03c4 lepton from the \u03c4 ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) decay will have a low (high) momentum, resulting in a lower (higher) overall event selection efficiency, producing a weaker (stronger) limit on the chargino mass. In the case where the \u03c4 ( \u03bd \u03c4 ) mass is close to the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 mass, the situations are opposite.

To reduce contamination from genuine \u03c4 h \u03c4 h events in CRs with at least one loose \u03c4 h candidate, same-sign (SS) \u03c4 h \u03c4 h pairs are selected. Residual contributions from genuine \u03c4 h \u03c4 h and W+jets events (non-QCD events) are subtracted based on MC expectations. The CR and signal region are illustrated in figure 3. In the samples dominated by QCD multijet events (CR1 and CR2), the isolation of misidentified \u03c4 h candidates is found to be uncorrelated with the search variables M T2 and \u03a3M \u03c4 i T . The QCD multijet background in the signal regions is therefore estimated by scaling the number of QCD multijet events with high M T2 or high \u03a3M \u03c4 i T and loosely isolated SS \u03c4 h \u03c4 h (CR3) by a transfer factor, which is the y-intercept of a horizontal line fitted to the ratio of the numbers of events in CR1 and CR2 in different bins of the low values of the search variables. The final estimate of the background is corrected for the efficiency of the \u2206\u03c6 requirement for QCD multijet events. This efficiency is measured in CR1 and CR2, in which the contribution of QCD multijet events is more than 80%. It is checked that the efficiency versus the search variable is same in both CR1 and CR2 and to gain in statistics, two CRs are combined before measuring the efficiency. The efficiency is a falling distribution as a function of the search variable (M T2 or \u03a3M \u03c4 i T ) and the value of the last bin (65 < M T2 < 90 GeV or 200 < \u03a3M \u03c4 i T < 250 GeV) is used conservatively as the value of the efficiency in the signal regions.",

In this simplified model, two \u03c4 particles are directly produced from the pp collision and decay promptly to two \u03c4 leptons and two neutralinos. The effect of the two \u03c4 h channels are found to be negligible and therefore are not considered. To calculate the production cross section, \u03c4 is defined as the left-handed \u03c4 gauge eigenstates [54]. Since the cross section for direct production of sleptons is lower, no point is excluded and a 95% CL upper limit is set on the cross section as a function of the \u03c4 mass. Figure 7 displays the ratio of the obtained upper limit on the cross section and the cross section expected from SUSY (signal strength) versus the mass of the \u03c4 particle, with the \u03c7 0 1 mass set to 1 GeV . The observed limit is within one standard deviation of the expected limit. The best limit, which corresponds to the lowest signal strength, is obtained for m \u03c4 = 150 GeV. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section at this mass is 43 (56) fb which is almost two times larger than the theoretical NLO prediction.",

In hadronic decays, \u03c4 vis is the difference between the 4-vector of the \u03c4 lepton and neutrino in the hadronic decay.
