            "text": "A search for the pair-production of scalar leptoquarks in 1 fb \u22121 of 7 TeV ATLAS data recorded at the LHC is presented. Leptoquarks are hypothetical color-triplet bosons which carry both quark and lepton flavor, and thus decay to a quark and a lepton, unlike any of the Standard Model particles. Leptoquarks arise from many beyond the Standard Model theories. The channels examined in this analysis require at least one leptoquark decay to an electron, which includes the final states eejj and e\u03bdjj. No excess of events is observed, thus limits on allowed leptoquark masses are determined. We exclude at 95% confidence level the production of first-generation scalar leptoquarks with mass m LQ < 660 (607) GeV when assuming a branching fraction of leptoquark decay to an electron of 1.0 (0.5).",

            "text": "Similarities between the generations of leptons and quarks in the Standard Model (SM) suggest that they might be part of some symmetry at energy scales larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. Numerous beyond the Standard Model theories include color-triplet gauge bosons known as leptoquarks (LQ), which would mediate the interaction between leptons and quarks [1]. Leptoquarks carry both lepton and baryon number, as well as fractional electric charge. The leptoquark Yukawa coupling \u03bb LQ\u2212 \u2212q , spin (0 or 1), and branching ratio to charged leptons \u03b2 are model dependent. Assuming \u03bb LQ\u2212 \u2212q is of the order of the electroweak coupling strength, leptoquarks are predominantly produced in pairs via gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation. The cross section for pair-production of scalar leptoquarks depends only on the unknown LQ mass and has been calculated up to next-to-leading order [2]. To accommodate experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents and lepton and baryon number violation, it is assumed that leptoquarks couple only to quarks and leptons of a single generation. Thus, they are classified as first-, second-, or third-generation by the generation of leptons to which they couple. Lower mass bounds for firstgeneration scalar leptoquarks already exist from searches for leptoquarks produced in pairs at the LHC [3]  [4], Tevatron [5], and LEP [6]. Limits on single LQ production come from HERA [7] and other experiments [8].",

            "text": "We report on a search for pair-production of first-generation scalar leptoquarks at ATLAS using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.03 fb \u22121 . No excess over SM background expectations is observed in the data in the signal enhanced region, and 95% CL upper bounds on the production cross section are determined. 607 (587) GeV when assuming its branching fraction to an electron is equal to 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. These are the most stringent limits to date arising from direct searches for leptoquarks.",

The QCD background is estimated from data, while the other background contributions are obtained from simulated samples as described in Section 4. The LQ signal corresponding to a LQ mass of 600 GeV is indicated by a solid line, and is normalized assuming \u03b2 = 1.0 (0.5) in the eejj (e\u03bdjj) channel. The lowest bin corresponds to background events in regions of the phase space for which no signal events are expected. The solid line (band) in the lower plot shows the Gaussian statistical (statistical + systematic) significance between data and the prediction.",
