The data already collected are being used to pursue the experiment's primary physics goal that is the search for New Physics via the measurement of CP asymmetries and rare decays in the b and c sector. The LHC is already capable of delivering higher luminosity than is currently used at LHCb, and an LHCb upgrade is planned for 2018 which will allow the detector to exploit higher luminosity running, and at the same time to enhance the trigger efficiencies, particularly in the hadronic decay modes. This upgrade will allow the experiment to accumulate an integrated luminosity of \u223c 50 fb \u22121 over the following decade, and acquire enormous samples of b and c hadron decays to allow for more precise measurements and a deeper exploration of the flavour sector. In addition, the flexibility of the new proposed trigger together with the unique angular coverage of the LHCb experiment opens up possibilities for interesting discoveries beyond the flavour sector, and will allow LHCb to focus on the physics channels which will be of most interest in the light of the discoveries of the coming decade.",

The strategy for this upgrade builds on the very successful startup of the current experiment, during which the hardware has shown an excellent performance, the trigger strategy has been validated, and the quality of the physics results using first data is in line with or has exceeded the goals of the LHCb physics roadmap documents [1]. This paper is organised as follows. Firstly the LHCb experiment, together with its current limitations, is outlined, and the upgrade of the trigger to a 40 MHz readout is introduced. Then the physics programme of the upgraded detector, which is expected to collect an integrated luminosity of 50 fb \u22121 with improved trigger efficiency, is described. Finally the detector environment of the upgrade and the principal hardware interventions which are required are discussed. For a full description of the LHCb upgrade programme, the reader is referred to the Letter of Intent [2], which has recently been approved by the LHCC.",

            "text": "LHCb is a forward spectrometer experiment measuring the products of proton-proton collisions at the LHC. It is designed to exploit the enormous bb and cc cross section at the LHC by triggering on and reconstructing the beauty and charm meson decay products. Its main physics goal is the indirect search for New Physics via the measurement of CP asymmetries and the search for and study of rare decay processes. The forward geometry allows the experiment to capture 40% of the production crosssection, and to exploit the long flight distance of B hadrons for performing time dependent CP violation measurements, in particular in the B s sector. Comprehensive particle identification, essential for disentangling the B hadron decay modes, is provided by the RICH system, muon chambers and calorimeters. LHCb was designed to run at a luminosity of 2 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , which is below the luminosity at which ATLAS and CMS operate. Following trigger optimisation and an excellent detector commissioning phase the experiment is currently running at 3\u00d710 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and tests at higher luminosity are envisaged. The differential in luminosity between LHCb and ATLAS/CMS is achieved by imposing an offset in the beams at LHCb. This offset is reduced as the beam intensity decays, so that a constant luminosity is delivered to LHCb throughout the fill. The results of this called luminosity levelling technique [3] are illustrated in Fig. 1 for a typical fill. During the LHC start-up phase in 2010 LHCb has shown an excellent performance. Key performance indicators include a primary vertex resolution (for 25 tracks) of \u223c 13 \u00b5m in x and y, an impact parameter resolution of 13 \u00b5m + 25/p T \u00b5m, where Figure 1: Typical evolution of the luminosity during an LHC fill in Spring 2011, with the delivered luminosity to the general purpose detectors ATLAS and CMS shown in blue and black, and the delivered luminosity to LHCb in red. The observed near constant luminosity at LHCb is obtained through \"luminosity levelling\". p T is the transverse momentum in GeV/c, and a proper time resolution of \u223c 50 fs. The particle identification system is functioning well, and typical B hadron mass resolutions of 7-11 MeV have been demonstrated. With the \u223c 36pb \u22121 recorded in 2010 the LHCb physics programme is well underway; highlights include first observations of decay modes such as [6,7], as reported in this conference, a non systematic limited measurement of \u2206m s at the 0.7% level [8] and a limit on Br(B s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) [9] already reaching Tevatron sensitivity. By summer 2011 LHCb expects to collect up to an order of magnitude greater statistics and make significant advances in the core programme of flavour physics measurements.",

            "text": "With the current running conditions and machine schedule it is anticipated that LHCb will collect of the order of 5 fb \u22121 at centre of mass energies of 7 TeV and 14 TeV by 2016/7. After this amount of integrated luminosity the time to double statistics becomes too slow and thus LHCb plans to upgrade the detector to enable statistics to be accumulated at a significantly enhanced rate. This cannot be achieved by simply running at higher luminosity due to the fact that the current trigger scheme incorporates a hardware trigger at the earliest level, which uses information from objects of high transverse energy in the muon chambers and calorimeters, and reads out information from the entire detector at a maximum rate of 1 MHz. The consequence of this is that an increase in luminosity would force a corresponding raising of the transverses energy threshold for triggering in the hadronic channels, where the rates are very high, and there would be no net overall gain. The time available to this first level trigger is too short to be able to implement a more complex decision, even if extra information could be made available. It is therefore proposed to adopt a strategy of reading out the entire detector at a frequency of 40 MHz, and executing all the trigger algorithms in software, with an output rate of \u223c 20kHz. The event farm where this trigger would run would have to be sufficiently large to cope with the data rate, and a staged approach is anticipated, whereby a low level trigger with similar functionality to the current first level trigger, but a tunable rate, will be maintained. This low level trigger will protect against occupancy fluctuations and also provide a throttle which enriches the events during the staging period of the computing farm. The high level trigger algorithms will have all the event information available, and it is anticipated that a factor of up to 2 in efficiency can be achieved for the hadronic modes, which can be combined with the gain of running at increased luminosity. In the first phase of the upgrade the target running luminosity is 10 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and it is planned to accumulate 50 fb \u22121 over a period of 10 years. The evolution of signal efficiency at high luminosity running as a function of the bandwidth allocated to the LLT is shown in table 1. It can be seen that very good efficiencies are achieved as soon as the size of the computing farm allows for high LLT rates. In order to allow for the readout of LHCb at 40 MHz all the FE electronics must be adapted or redesigned, which also implies the complete replacement of components where the frontend (FE) electronics is integrated, such as the silicon detectors and RICH HPDs. At the same time LHCb will take the opportunity to implement detector enhancements to cope with the increased occupancies and integrated radiation levels associated with high luminosity running. ",

At the upgrade the fully software based trigger will allow selection of the topology of interest and very large data samples will be collected. This will give sufficient statistics to allow precise studies of CP violation in mixing and decay of charmed hadrons, in addition to searches for very rare charm decays such as D \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and lepton flavour violation e.g. D \u2192 e\u00b5.",

The effect on this on the pile-up, defined as the number of interactions per triggered bunch crossing is shown in figure 5. Operation has occured at pileup values of \u223c 2.5, which is very similar to that forseen at the upgrade. The signal to background of key channels have been investigated as a function of pileup and in general the loss of sensitivity is small. The evolution of the reconstruction efficiency as a function of pileup and occupancy has been studied with the real data and compared to simulation, giving good confidence that the simulation can correctly estimate the detector performance at the upgrade. The detector has not yet experienced spillover (defined as crosstalk from the previous or next event) from 25 ns running, however in 2011 the LHC has started operating with 50 ns bunch spacing, and this, together with the long drift times currently used in the outer tracker has enabled us to start to gain experience in this area also.",

The occupancy increase for those detectors not exposed to pileup is seen to be reasonable. When spillover is taken into account the occupancy increase is sharper. This is particularly relevant for the Outer tracker subdetector of LHCb, which is constructed with straw draft chambers, and eventually the drop in track reconstruction efficiency in this detector offsets the gain in luminosity, particularly for reconstruction of multibody final states. The LHCb experiment has already undergone a \"design reoptimisation\" exercise [15] to ensure that the material budget of the current detector has been kept to a minimum; at the upgrade this issue is equally important, due to the demands on keeping the occupancy as low as possible and maintaining momentum resolution, and the R&D will focus on maintaining or improving the current material budget.

It is intended to reuse large most of the mechanics, vacuum systems, and evaporative CO 2 cooling system. The modules and readout architecture must be completely replaced. A pixel based solution is under development, based on an evolution of the Timepix/Medipix family of chips. The chip is based on a 55\u00b5m by 55\u00b5m square pixel, and the upgrade geometry is similar to the current VELO, with each pair of R and \u03c6 strip sensors being replaced by one pixel plane. The new front end chip, dubbed VELOPix, will send out time stamped analogue pixel information and operate in data driven mode. One of the major challenges is to cope with the enormous data rate: a mean of 6 particles per bunch crossing for the innermost chips translates into data rates of the order of 10 Gbit/s. The R&D has focused on designing a chip architecture which can cope with the rate without loss of efficiency, in conjunction with a method of saving bandwidth by grouping the individual pixels into 4 \u00d7 4 superpixel clusters with a single timestamp. The data will be transmitted off chip using high speed serial links via copper flex cables capable of high speed transmission to the exit of the vacuum tank. Here electo-optical circuits will transfer the signals to optical fibres which will deliver the data to the remote backend electronics. The pixel module concept is illustrated in figure 6. Four 3-chip pixel ladders are assembled in an L-shaped arrangement on alternating sides of a diamond substrate, which acts as a cooling interface. For the innermost chips, metal traces on the diamond bring the signals to miniaturized connectors. The outermost part of the module, where the material is less critical, consists of a TPG (Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite) frame which acts as a support for the cooling and readout infrastructure. Twenty-six such modules are arranged along the beam direction. The shape of the foil, which separates the secondary vacuum of the VELO from the primary LHC vacuum must be modified to accommodate the L shaped structure. Various options are under consideration, including use of carbon fibre composites, using workable metal alloys as for the current VELO, or direct milling of the foil from a solid metal block. A goal of the R&D is to achieve a reduction in material compared to the current design, which contributes significantly to the amount of material seen before the second measured point, and is an important consideration for the impact parameter resolution.",

At the upgrade the silicon modules must be replaced, due to the incompatibility of the present electronics with the 40 MHz readout. The current layout is driven by occupancy considerations; the IT is designed to cover sufficient surface area such that the occupancy in the innermost parts of the straw tubes remains below 10%. In practice events with higher pileup have been successfully reconstructed with the current geometry, however it is this consideration which drives the target luminosity for the first phase of LHCb upgrade. One contributing factor to the OT occupancy is the material of the IT infrastructure inside the sensitive volume, consisting of readout hybrids and cables, mechanical supports and cooling channels. This material has a rather non-uniform distribution and at the upgrade a reduction of material, for instance by moving the readout infrastructure outside the sensitive area, will be aimed for. In addition, options of increasing the surface area coverage of the Inner Tracker and reducing the straw tube lengths in the regions above and below the beam pipe are under consideration, given the excellent performance of the current IT in the high pileup environment. The radiation tolerance of the OT straws is also a consideration for the upgrade, with the current detector having been designed to accumulate an integrated luminosity of \u223c 20 fb \u22121 , but with some indications of aging effects emerging from laboratory tests. The experience of 2011 running will be important to estimate the longevity of the current detector, and will give an opportunity to test the various solutions which have been proposed to overcome aging issues.",

Low momentum PID is currently provided by aerogel and C 4 F 10 radiators in the upstream RICH-1 detector. For the upgrade the occupancy of photodetector hits for the aerogel component will reach unacceptable levels and it is planned to remove the radiator completely, saving 5% X 0 in the detector acceptance. The low momentum PID will be augmented with a novel timeof-flight system, the TORCH, based on the detection of Cherenkov light produced in a 1 cm thick quartz plate situated downstream in the experiment. The produced photons propagate by total internal reflection to the edge of the quartz plate and are focussed onto an array of MCPs at the periphery. The time of arrival of the photons depends on the track time of flight together with the Cherenkov angle dependent path length in the quartz plate. It is anticipated that with a 70 ps resolution per single-photon time measurement, sufficient separation power can be achieved for the physics goals of the experiment, a target that seems reachable with the use of MCPs in combination with the NINO and HPTDC chip sets.",
