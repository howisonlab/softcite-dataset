Beyond leading-order quantum chromodynamics (LO QCD), the mass of the top quark is a convention-dependent parameter. Therefore, it is important to know how to interpret this experimental result in terms of renormalization conventions [2] if the value is to be used as an input to higher-order QCD calculations or in fits of electroweak precision observables and the resulting indirect Higgs boson mass bounds [3]. The definition of mass in field theory can be divided into two categories [4]: (i) driven by long-distance behavior, which corresponds to the pole-mass scheme, and (ii) * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c SLAC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, d University College London, London, UK, e Centro de Investigacion en Computacion -IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, f ECFM, Universidad Autonoma de Sinaloa, Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico, and g Universit\u00e4t Bern, Bern, Switzerland. driven by short-distance behavior, which, for example, is represented by the MS mass scheme. The difference between the masses in different schemes can be calculated as a perturbative series in \u03b1 s . However, the concept of the pole mass is ill-defined, since there is no pole in the quark propagator in a confining theory such as QCD [5].",

One is based on a comparison of Monte Carlo (MC) templates for different assumed values of m t with distributions of kinematic quantities measured in data. In the second approach, m t is extracted from the reconstruction of the final states in data using a calibration curve obtained from MC simulation. In both cases the quantity measured in data therefore corresponds to the top quark mass scheme used in the MC simulation, which we refer to as m MC t . Current MC simulations are performed in LO QCD, and higher order effects are simulated through parton showers at modified leading logarithms (LL) level. In principle, it is not possible to establish a direct connec-tion between m MC t and any other mass scheme, such as the pole or MS mass scheme, without calculating the parton showers to at least next-to-leading logarithms (NLL) accuracy. However, it has been argued that m MC t should be close to the pole mass [6,7]. The relation between m MC t and the top quark pole mass (m pole t ) or MS mass (m MS t ) is still under theoretical investigation. In calculations such as in Ref. [3] it is assumed that m MC t measured at the Tevatron is equal to m pole t .",

[14] (green contour) and approximate NNLO [15] (red contour). This is compared to the indirect constraints on the W boson mass and the top quark mass based on LEP-I/SLD data (dashed contour). In both cases the 68% CL contours are given. Also shown is the SM relationship for the masses as a function of the Higgs mass in the region favoured by theory (< 1000 GeV) and not excluded by direct searches (114 GeV to 158 GeV and > 173 GeV). The arrow labelled \u2206\u03b1 shows the variation of this relation if \u03b1(m 2 Z ) is varied between \u22121 and +1 sd. This variation gives an additional uncertainty to the SM band shown in the figure. Table III. We include half of this difference symmetrically in the systematic uncertainties and derive a value of m MS t = 154.5 +5.2 \u22124.5 GeV using the calculation of Ref. [14] and m MS t = 160.0 +5.1 \u22124.5 GeV using Ref. [15]. To summarize, we extract the pole mass (Table II) and the MS mass (Table III) for the top quark by comparing the measured \u03c3 tt with different higher-order perturbative QCD calculations. The Tevatron direct measurements of m t are consistent with both m pole t measurements within 2 sd, but they are different by more than 2 sd from the extracted m MS t . The results on m pole t and their interplay with other electroweak results within the SM are displayed in Fig. 3, which is based on Ref. [3].",
