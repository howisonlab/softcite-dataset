This analysis, with more data and channels where the Z bosons decay to muons or jets, supersedes the 1.1 fb \u22121 four-electron channel result previously published by CDF. In order to maintain high efficiency for muons, we use a new forward tracking algorithm and muon identification requirements optimized for these high signal-to-background channels. Predicting the dominant backgrounds in each channel entirely from sideband data samples, we observe four-body invariant mass spectra above 300 GeV/c 2 that are consistent with background. We set limits using the acceptance for a massive graviton resonance that are 7-20 times stronger than the previously published direct limits on resonant ZZ diboson production.",

New theoretical ideas can be tested with collider experiments, but it is also worthwhile for experiments to search broadly for anomalous \"signatures\". One common tactic is to look where experiments are keenly sensitive. The consummate example of this method is the Z boson search, in which a low-background, well-understood observable (the dilepton invariant mass) is used to constrain the new physics models that predict a dilepton resonance. Diboson resonance searches are an attractive analog of the Z boson searches, involving higher multiplicities of the same outgoing particles and additional mass constraints, both of which serve to further suppress experimental backgrounds. Dibosons are the dominant channels for high mass higgs searches, and new physics scenarios predict particles such as Randall-Sundrum gravitons which would decay into dibosons [1]. The irreducible SM diboson background processes occur at such a low rate that they have only recently been observed at the Tevatron [2,3] at low diboson mass (M ZZ < 300 GeV/c 2 ). At high diboson mass (M ZZ > 300 GeV/c 2 ) the total backgrounds are tiny.",

These ZZ diboson processes have been wellstudied at the LEP experiments, which observed no significant deviation from the standard model expectation up to an e + e \u2212 center-of-mass energy of 207 GeV [4][5][6][7]. The LEP data place only indirect constraints on heavier, resonant ZZ diboson production [8], however, and direct production constraints at high ZZ diboson masses must be probed at hadron colliders.

Though we avoid focus on any one specific model, we choose a benchmark process that is implemented in several popular Monte Carlo generation programs, the virtual production of gravitons in a simple Randall-Sundrum RS1 scenario [1,10], to fix acceptance for the search and quantify its sensitivity. The geometry of the model consists of two three-branes separated from each other by a single extra dimension. Boundary conditions at the branes quantize the momentum in the extra dimension, leading to a Kaluza-Klein tower of discrete, massive gravitons. In RS1 scenarios with the standard model particles confined to either brane, a discovery would involve graviton decays directly to photons or leptons-the graviton branching ratio to ZZ is significant but the Z boson branching ratio to leptons is small. In more complex but well-motivated scenarios with SM particles allowed in the extra dimension, however, graviton decays to photons, leptons, and light jets can be suppressed, and dibosons become an important discovery channel [11,12].",

The double Z boson mass peak signature admits little background, allowing appreciably more efficient electron criteria than those used for many other CDF analyses (for example, Ref. [13]). We require either an isolated calorimeter cluster with electron-like energy deposition or, to recover acceptance, an isolated track pointing at uninstrumented regions of the calorimeters. Such regions constitute approximately 17% of the solid angle for |\u03b7| < 1.2 and would otherwise reduce our four-electron acceptance by a factor of two. The transverse energy threshold for non-trigger electrons is 5 GeV. As the mass of the signal resonance X \u2192 ZZ increases, the energies of the two Z boson decay products become asymmetric in the detector frame, and thus our criteria must efficiently select leptons with transverse momentum of order 10 GeV/c as well as leptons with p T of hundreds of GeV/c. The muon criteria listed in Table III require an isolated track satisfying basic track quality criteria and depositing minimal energy in the calorimeter. We make use of a new track reconstruction algorithm, described in the Appendix, and apply less stringent energy and isolation requirements than typical for CDF high p T analyses so as to increase our acceptance and efficiency. Muon candidate tracks may be matched to information in the muon chambers, but to recover acceptance lost due to gaps in chamber coverage and to recover efficiency lost due to pointing requirements, chamber matching is not required except for the trigger muon.",

The uncertainty includes diboson cross-section uncertainties, the uncertainty on the luminosity, the statistical uncertainty from the simulation, and the uncertainties from the non-resonant background fits.  Absent evidence of a signal, we communicate our sensitivity to X \u2192 ZZ processes by setting limits with an acceptance from a widely-available herwig Monte Carlo process [23], the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein graviton. The total acceptance times efficiency for this process varies between roughly 40-50% for a given four-lepton channel and between 20-40% for a given dijet channel ( Fig. 17). At higher masses, the fraction of Z boson decays increases in which the angular separation between products is too small for the calorimeter to resolve. This lowers the acceptances for the dijet modes and, to a lesser extent, the electron modes.",

We use marginalized truncated-Gaussian nuisance parameters for the luminosity, background predictions, and signal efficiencies, and we account for systematic uncertainties correlated amongst the six channels when appropriate. As discussed earlier, we assign a 20% uncorrelated uncertainty to the total acceptance \u00d7 efficiency for each channel to account for the observed time-dependent variation in the Drell-Yan \u00b5\u00b5 cross-section, conservatively covering the sum of individual systematic uncertainties such as signal acceptance uncertainties in order to simplify the combination. Studies of the individual uncertainties indicate the largest contribution after the uncertainty due to the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 cross section variation is the 5.9% uncertainty on the luminosity. In addition to the observed limit, we compute expected limits from 10,000 pseudo-experiments at each candidate X mass.

The Backward algorithm, illustrated in Fig. 21 for a simple case, starts by searching the COT for hits unused by the central COT algorithm and constructing segments in one of the inner axial superlayers consisting of no more than 12 hits. At this stage, the position measurements contain a drift sign ambiguity and important drift time corrections, such as large time of flight and sense wire signal propagation times, are unknown and cannot be approximated by the constant corrections assumed for the central segment pattern recognition. The Backward algorithm solves this problem with a variant of the central segment pattern recognition that resolves the drift sign ambiguity and drift time corrections during the search and is optimized for tracking in the low radius, high hit density inner superlayers and near the COT endplates. Once unused COT hit segments are found consistent with a forward track, the algorithm then fits the segments with a beamline constraint to obtain five-parameter helices that intersect the z position of the highest sum p T z vertex identified using central algorithm tracks. In most cases, the fits do not conclusively identify stereo COT measurements in the innermost stereo superlayer, and so multiple helices are obtained corresponding to trajectories through each possible combination of silicon module and polar angle. Drift time corrections are recomputed for each case.",

High quality central tracking (|\u03b7| < 1) starts in the COT and assembles piecewise segments of up to 12 hits in each superlayer, fits them, and groups them into tracks to which any available silicon hits are then attached in an outside-in search. Afterward, \"silicon standalone\" tracking starts with all possible combinations of three unused silicon hits, searches the remaining silicon layers, and projects successful tracks into the COT to attach any compatible hits in order to improve the track momentum resolution and lower the fake rate.",
