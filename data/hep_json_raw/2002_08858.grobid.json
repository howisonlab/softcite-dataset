The precision is dominated by measurements exploiting the B + \u2192 DK + decay, 1 where D indicates a superposition of D 0 and D 0 mesons reconstructed in a final state common to both. To continue improving the precision on \u03b3, independent measurements can be performed JHEP06(2020)058 using all suitable D meson final states. Several different final states have thus far been analysed at LHCb, including a previous measurement of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed D \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D \u2192 K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 modes [7]. These decays are reconstructed in two categories by comparing the charge of the pion produced in the D decay with the charge of the B meson; B + \u2192 [K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 ] D h + decays are thus labelled \"Same Sign\" (SS), and B + \u2192 [K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + ] D h + decays are labelled \"Opposite Sign\" (OS), where h \u2208 {\u03c0, K}. This paper reports an update to ref.

Data corresponding to 6.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected between 2015 and 2018 (Run 2) of data taking is used. The Run 1 dataset collected during 2011 and 2012 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 is also reprocessed, to benefit from an improved selection as well as a reappraisal of the backgrounds.",

Instead of employing an amplitude model to describe the contributing partial waves, the CLEO collaboration have made measurements of the effective amplitude and phase variation using a sample of quantumcorrelated D decays collected by the CLEO-c experiment [8]. Due to limited sample size, those measurements were performed averaging over large regions of the Dalitz plot, notably defining one of two regions to contain the D \u2192 K * (892) + K \u2212 mode. In the present work, results are reported for both the K * + and non-K * + regions of the Dalitz plot, respecting the boundary defined by CLEO-c. The use of external CLEO-c results, which were performed across the full Dalitz plot and within the K * + region, avoids the need to introduce a systematic uncertainty resulting from an amplitude model description.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip JHEP06(2020)058 vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",
