However, there may be other CP -violating sources beyond the SM. Charmless hadronic B decays, like B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S , are of great interest because they are dominated by loop diagrams and are thus sensitive to new physics effects at large energy scales [1]. In the SM, the mixinginduced CP -violation parameters in this decay are expected to be the same, up to \u223c 1% [2], as in the treediagram-dominated modes such as B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S . Both BABAR [3] and Belle [4] have previously performed timedependent CP -violation measurements of the inclusive mode B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S , which is permissible because the final state is CP definite [5].",

This paper presents the first amplitude analysis and the final BABAR update of the time-dependent CPasymmetry measurement of B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S using the full \u03a5 (4S) dataset. The amplitude analysis is timeintegrated CP -averaged (i.e., it does not use flavortagging information to distinguish between B 0 and B 0 mesons). It takes advantage of the interference pattern in the DP to measure relative magnitudes and phases for the different resonant modes using B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S decays with K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , denoted by B 0 \u2192 3K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). The magnitudes and phases are then translated into individual branching fractions for the resonant modes. The time-dependent analysis extracts the S and C parameters by modeling the proper-time distribution. This part of the analysis uses both B 0 \u2192 3K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) events and events where one of the K 0 S mesons decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , denoted by B 0 \u2192 2K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K 0 S (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ).

The sum excludes the B candidate and all quantities are calculated in the \u03a5 (4S) frame. The NN is trained with off-resonance data, sideband data and simulated signal events that pass the selection criteria. Approximately 0.5% of events passing the full selection have more than one candidate. When this occurs, we select the candidate for which the errorweighted average of the masses of the K 0 S candidates is closest to the world average K 0 S mass [16]. With the above selection criteria, we obtain a signal reconstruction efficiency of 6.6% that has been determined from a signal Monte Carlo (MC) sample generated using the same DP model and parameters as obtained from the data fit results. We estimate from this MC that 1.4% of the selected signal events are misreconstructed, and as-sign a systematic uncertainty (see Sec. III F). We use MC events to study the background from other B decays (B background). We expect fewer than 6 such events in our data sample. As these events are wrongly reconstructed, the m ES and \u2206E distributions are continuum-like and as a result the events are mostly absorbed in the continuum background category. We assign a systematic uncertainty for B background contamination in the signal.",

The \"B reco \" uncertainty propagates the experimental uncertainty in the measurement of tagside-related quantities taken from [27] to our measurement. The \"B-bkg\" contribution results from the uncertainty in the CP content and the branching fractions of fixed yields in the model of background from B decays. The dominant \"MC-Data: \u2206t\" systematic uncertainty is due to possible differences between data and simulation concerning the procedure used to obtain the signal B decay vertex from tracks originating from K 0 S decays. We quantify this uncertainty using the control sample B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S by comparing the difference between \u2206t values obtained with and without the J/\u03c8 in data and simulation. We then propagate the observed differences and their uncertainties to the resolution function. We use this new resolution function to refit the data and obtain an estimate of the effect on S and C. We also use the samples B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) to estimate simulation-data differences for the other variables in the submodes",

The \"Fit Bias\" uncertainty is evaluated using fits to fully reconstructed MC samples. It accounts for effects from wrongly reconstructed events and correlations between fit variables. The \"Vetoes\" uncertainty is related to the veto on the invariant mass. It is evaluated using events that pass the veto in pseudo-experiments studies. Finally, the \"Misc\" uncertainty includes contributions from doubly-Cabbibbo-suppressed decays, silicon vertex tracker alignment, and the uncertainties in the boost of the \u03a5 (4S). These contributions are taken from the BABAR B \u2192 ccK ( * ) analysis [27].",

            "text": "We have performed the first amplitude analysis of B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S events and measured the total inclusive branching fraction to be (6.19\u00b10.48\u00b10.15\u00b10.12)\u00d710 \u22126 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third represents the signal DPmodel dependence. We have identified the dominant contributions to the DP to be from f 0 (980), f 0 (1710), f 2 (2010), and a nonresonant component, and measured the individual fit fractions and phases of each component. We do not observe any significant contribution from the so-called f X (1500) resonance seen in, for example, B + \u2192 K + K \u2212 K + [6]. The peak in the invariant mass between 1.5 and 1.6 GeV/c 2 can be described by the interference between the f 0 (1710) resonance and the nonresonant component. We see some hints from the f \u2032 2 (1525) and f 0 (1500) resonances that could also contribute to this structure, but due to limited sample size we cannot make a significant statement. Future investigations of the KK system could shed more light on the situation. Furthermore we have performed an update of the phase-space-integrated time-dependent analysis of the same decay mode, using B 0 \u2192 3K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and B 0 \u2192 2K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K 0 S (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) decays, with the final BABAR dataset. We measure the CP -violation parameters to be S = \u22120.94 +0. 24 \u22120.21 \u00b1 0.06 and C = \u22120.17 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b1 0.04, where the first quoted uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. These measured values are consistent with and supersede those reported in Ref. [3]. They are compatible within two standard deviations with those measured in tree-dominated modes such as B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S , as expected in the SM. For the first time, we report evidence of CP violation in B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S decays; CP conservation is excluded at 3.8 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties.",
