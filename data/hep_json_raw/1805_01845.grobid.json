Two methods are used to extract the efficiency from tt events, a combinatorial likelihood approach and a tag-and-probe method. A boosted decision tree, not using b-tagging information, is used to select events in which two b-jets are present, which reduces the dominant uncertainty in the modelling of the flavour of the jets. The efficiency is extracted for jets in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 300 GeV, with data-to-simulation scale factors calculated by comparing the efficiency measured using collision data to that predicted by the simulation. The two methods give compatible results, and achieve a similar level of precision, measuring data-to-simulation scale factors close to unity with uncertainties ranging from 2% to 12% depending on the jet transverse momentum.",

A very pure tt sample is selected, as these events have a high b-jets purity by virtue of the t \u2192 W b branching fraction being close to 100% [2]. The number of additional non-b-jets in the sample is greatly reduced by requiring that both W bosons decay leptonically. Two methods are used to measure the b-jet tagging efficiency: a new method which uses a tag-and-probe approach, referred to as the Tag-and-Probe method (T&P); and a combinatorial likelihood JHEP08(2018)089 approach, referred to as the Likelihood method (LH), which is based upon a method used during Run 1 ( \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV) of the LHC [3]. Having two methods enables reciprocal cross-checks to be made between them.",

Operating points are defined by sets of selection criteria imposed upon the output of the b-tagging algorithm designed to provide a certain b-jet tagging efficiency. Four operating points are defined, corresponding to 60%, 70%, 77% and 85% b-jet tagging efficiencies in simulated tt events. Two sets of four operating points are implemented to provide a singlecut or a flat-efficiency operating point. The single-cut operating point provides the stated b-jet tagging efficiency when averaged over the transverse momentum distribution of b-jets in tt events, but the efficiency varies with jet p T . On the other hand, the flat-efficiency operating point has a varying cut value, ensuring a constant b-jet tagging efficiency as a function of the jet p T . Results are also presented in the form of data-to-simulation efficiency scale factors, defined as \u03b5 data b /\u03b5 sim b , where \u03b5 data b is the efficiency measured in data, while \u03b5 sim b represents the efficiency predicted by simulation using Monte Carlo (MC) generatorlevel information. In physics measurements, these scale factors can be applied jet by jet to correct the rate of events after applying a b-tagging requirement. The scale factors are measured for all operating points; however, this paper presents only results from a number of selected working points as examples. Separate measurements have also been made for the tagging efficiencies of jets containing c-hadrons, referred to as c-jets, and for jets containing neither a b-hadron nor a c-hadron, referred to as light-flavour jets, and are presented in ref. [3].",

The reconstructed jets are then calibrated to the jet energy scale (JES), corresponding to the particle scale, 2 using corrections derived from simulation and in situ corrections based on 13 TeV data [13]. Jets are required to have calibrated p T > 20 GeV and to be within the acceptance of the inner detector, |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jet cleaning criteria are applied to identify jets arising from non-collision sources or noise in the calorimeter [14,15]. Any event containing such a jet is removed. In order to reduce the contamination from jets arising from additional pp collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings, called pile-up, a requirement on the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) [16] output is made. The JVT algorithm combines tracking information into a multivariate algorithm to reject jets which do not originate from the primary vertex, and is applied to jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.

The algorithm is similar to the multivariate algorithms developed during Run 1 [3], but with a dedicated optimisation carried out for Run 2 to exploit the installation of the IBL and improved tracking software [18,19]. The algorithms which provide the input variables for MV2c10 all exploit the relatively long bhadron lifetime: a likelihood-based combination of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances; the presence of a secondary vertex and related properties; and the reconstruction of the b-hadron decay chain using a Kalman filter to search for a common direction connecting the primary vertex to both the bottom and the tertiary charm decay vertices. Additionally, the jet p T and jet \u03b7 are included as BDT training variables to take advantage of correlations with other variables. In order to avoid any difference between the kinematic spectra of b-jets and background jets being used as a discriminating variable, the b-jet p T and \u03b7 spectra are reweighted to match the combined c-jet and light-flavour jet spectrum. The BDT was trained on a subset of events from a simulated tt sample, produced with Powheg [20][21][22][23] interfaced with Pythia6 for the parton shower, hadronisation, and the underlying event [24] and using the CT10 [25] parton distribution function set, as described in more detail in section 4. The BDT training is performed by assigning bjets as signal, and c-jets and light-flavour jets as background. In order to enhance the c-jet rejection, the c-jet fraction in the training is set to 7%, and the light-flavour jet background is set to 93%, as described in ref. [19].",

In 2015 this threshold was 20 GeV for muons and 24 GeV for electrons, while in 2016 it was raised to 26 GeV for both the electrons and muons. These triggers are combined with higher-threshold triggers, of 50 GeV for muons and 60, 120 and 140 GeV for electrons, without isolation requirements, to improve the trigger efficiency for leptons with high transverse momentum. Table 2 summarises the event selection criteria specific to the Likelihood and T&P methods. The events are selected by requiring two oppositely charged signal leptons (e\u00b5, ee or \u00b5\u00b5) and two or three jets. One of the leptons must also be matched using a \u2206R requirement to one of the objects that triggered the event. A veto is applied to events which contain one or more additional loose leptons. The T&P method uses only the tt \u2192 e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bd + 2-jet category, with an additional requirement that at least one jet must be tagged by the MV2c10 algorithm at the 85% single-cut efficiency OP. The LH method also exploits events with exactly three jets, as well as events with same-flavour leptons in the final state. For events with same-flavour leptons in the final state, additional requirements of E miss T > 60 GeV and dilepton invariant mass 50 < m < 80 GeV or m > 100 GeV are applied to suppress the contamination from on-shell Z boson decays, multijet production and decays of \u03b3 * , \u03a5 and J/\u03c8 particles. In the e\u00b5 + 2-jet channel of the LH (T&P) method, a tt purity of 82% (90%) is obtained, with sub-dominant contributions from single top, Z/\u03b3 * + jets and diboson processes and events containing a misidentified lepton. In the e\u00b5 + 3-jet, + 2-jet and + 3-jet channels of the LH method, the tt contribution is 88%, 71% and 79%, respectively. Figure 3 shows the jet p T and m distributions for events passing the e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bd + 2-jet selection before any requirement on the MV2c10 output is applied.

The alternative generators induce changes in the event kinematics and flavour composition, thereby affecting the extracted scale factors. The difference between the scale factors is taken as the systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties are estimated for the predictions from the nominal JHEP08(2018)089 tt sample (Powheg+Pythia6), by altering the choice of parton shower and hadronisation generator (Powheg+Herwig++) or by altering the matrix element generator (MG5 aMC@NLO+Herwig++). Changing the settings of the nominal generator to increase or decrease the amount of parton radiation and varying the choice of parton distribution function (PDF) set (MG5 aMC@NLO+Herwig++ with CT10 PDFs or PDF4LHC15 NLO PDFs) gives additional sources of uncertainty. Further uncertainties due to the observed mismodelling of the top quark and tt-system p T are evaluated by taking the difference between the default tt prediction and a sample in which the top quark and tt-system p T distributions are reweighted to match predictions at NNLO accuracy in QCD [45,46]. For W t single-top production, uncertainties are estimated by varying the parton shower and hadronisation modelling (Powheg+Herwig++) and varying settings of the nominal generator to increase or decrease the amount of parton radiation. The uncertainty in the treatment of the interference between W t and tt is assessed by replacing the nominal diagram removal (DR) scheme with a diagram subtraction (DS) scheme [47] in Powheg+Pythia6. An additional 6% uncertainty is applied to the normalisation of the single-top samples to account for the uncertainty in the predicted cross-section [30]. For the Z/\u03b3 * + jets process, the nominal samples (MG5 aMC@NLO) are compared to the alternative Powheg+Pythia8 sample. In addition an uncertainty is estimated for the modelling of the jet p T spectrum in the Z/\u03b3 * + jets events with the same-flavour leptons in the final state by reweighting the spectrum to match the data in the Z/\u03b3 * + jets control sample.",

For both the electrons [8] and muons [10], uncertainties are estimated for the energy scale and resolution, as well as the reconstruction, identification, and trigger efficiencies using 13 TeV data. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are evaluated using 13 TeV data [13], and so is an uncertainty in the efficiency of the JVT selection [16]. The uncertainties in the energy scale and resolution of the jets and leptons are propagated to the calculation of the E miss T , which also has additional dedicated uncertainties from the momentum scale, resolution and efficiency of the tracks not associated with any of the reconstructed objects, along with the modelling of the underlying event. The predicted rate of mistakenly tagging non-b-jets is corrected using data-to-simulation efficiency scale factors measured separately for c-jets and light-flavour jets [3]. The uncertainty in this prediction is estimated by varying these scale factors within their associated uncertainties. For Run 2 data, the c-jet efficiency scale factor uncertainty varies from \u223c 15% for a jet p T of 100 GeV, to \u223c 30% for a jet p T of 300 GeV. For light-flavour jets, the uncertainty varies from \u223c 40% for a jet p T of 100 GeV, to \u223c 30% for a jet p T of 300 GeV. The uncertainty due to the reweighting of the distribution of the expected average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \u00b5 , from the simulation to the one measured in data is estimated by varying the nominal reweighting scale factor by the size of the nominal correction. The uncertainty in the combined 2015 and 2016 integrated luminosity is 3.2%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref.

When combining all four channels in the LH method, all single systematic variations are treated as fully correlated, except for the background modelling uncertainties, for which a 50% correlation is assumed. This partial correlation is applied, as each modelling variation is expected to account for more than one effect.

Normalisation and modelling of the Z/\u03b3 * + jets background, as well as the normalisation of the diboson backgrounds have a larger effect in the LH method than in the T&P method. This is due to the inclusion of the events with three jets and events with the same-flavour leptons in the final state, as these regions have a larger contribution from the Z/\u03b3 * + jets and diboson backgrounds.",

This term is calculated from simulated events by considering variations of the quantities affecting the b-tagging performance such as the impact parameter resolution, percentage of poorly measured tracks, description of the detector material, and the track multiplicity per jet. The dominant effect on the uncertainty when extrapolating at high p T is related to the different tagging efficiencies after smearing the tracks' impact parameters according to the resolutions measured in data and simulation. The difference in the impact parameter resolution is due to effects from alignment, dead modules and additional material not properly modelled in the simulation.

Since bin-to-bin correlations are assumed, these matrices have non-zero off-diagonal elements. The total covariance matrix is constructed by summing these covariance matrices corresponding to different sources of uncertainty. As the total covariance matrix is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix, an eigenvector decomposition can be performed. Such a procedure provides orthogonal variations whose size is given by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalues. The resulting number of variations is six, corresponding to the number of bins used for the calibration, and is an important simplification in the implementation of systematic uncertainties in physics analyses.",

Thus, a tradeoff is made as to how much of the total uncertainty is preserved versus the correlations. Three different schemes of eigen-variation reduction are implemented: 'loose' provides a complete description of the total uncertainty and correlations, 'medium' has a small amount of loss in the total uncertainty or correlation loss (of the order of 3% relative difference), and 'tight' has a more aggressive reduction, where more loss in the total uncertainty or correlation is tolerated (of the order of 10-50% relative difference).",

A boosted decision tree, based on event topology only, is used to select events in which two b-jets are present, reducing the contamination from events in which only one b-jet is reconstructed in the detector acceptance. The implementation of a boosted decision tree in the event selection reduces the dominant uncertainty in the modelling of the flavour of the jets in the tt events by up to 50%. Two methods are used to extract the efficiency from the tt events, a tag-and-probe method and a combinatorial -25 -JHEP08(2018)089 likelihood approach. The efficiency is extracted for R = 0.4 calorimeter-jets in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 300 GeV, with data-to-simulation scale factors calculated by comparing the efficiency extracted from collision data to that obtained from simulation. The two methods produce consistent results with similar precision. The measured data-tosimulation scale factors are close to unity with a total uncertainty ranging from 2% to 12%. In addition, the data-to-simulation scale factors are measured as a function of the jet \u03b7 and the average number of interactions per bunch crossing, in selected bins of the jet p T , and are found not to have a significant dependence on either of these variables. The generator dependence of the data-to-simulation scale factors is assessed, along with procedures for smoothing the scale factors, and reducing the number of nuisance parameters arising from the data-to-simulation scale factors.",
