            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM), CP violation arises through a single phase in the CKM quark mixing matrix [1]. In decays of neutral B mesons (B stands for a B 0 or B 0 s meson) to a final state accessible to both B and B, the interference between the amplitude for the direct decay and the amplitude for decay via oscillation leads to time-dependent CP violation. A measurement of the time-dependent CP asymmetry in the B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8K 0 S mode allows for a determination of the B 0 -B 0 mixing phase \u03c6 d . In the SM it is equal to 2\u03b2 [2], where \u03b2 is one of the angles of the unitarity triangle in the quark mixing matrix. This phase has already been well measured by the B factories [3,4], but further improvements are still necessary to conclusively resolve possible small tensions with the other measurements constraining the unitarity triangle [5]. The latest average composed by the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group (HFAG) is sin \u03c6 d = 0.682 \u00b1 0.019 [6]. To achieve precision below the percent level, knowledge of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed higher order perturbative corrections, originating from penguin topologies, becomes mandatory. These contributions are difficult to calculate reliably and therefore need to be determined directly from experimentally accessible observables.",

In the remainder of this paper, these two datasets will be referred to as the long and downstream K 0 S sample, respectively. The NN classifiers use information about the candidate kinematics, vertex and track quality, impact parameter, particle identification information from the RICH and muon detectors, as well as global event properties like track and interaction vertex multiplicities. The variables that are used in the NN are chosen to avoid correlations with the reconstructed B mass. Final selection requirements on the NN classifier outputs are chosen to optimise the expected sensitivity to the B 0 s signal observation. The expected signal and background yields entering the calculation of the figure of merit [29] are obtained from the normalisation sample by scaling the number of fitted B 0 candidates, and by counting the number of events in the mass ranges [5180, 5240] MeV/c 2 and [5400, 5520] MeV/c 2 , respectively. After applying the final requirement on the NN classifier output associated with the long (downstream) K 0 S sample, the multivariate selection rejects, relative to the initial selection, 98.7% (99.6%) of the background while keeping 71.5% (50.2%) of the B 0 signal. Due to the worse initial signal to background ratio, the final requirement on the NN classifier output is much tighter in the downstream K 0 S sample than in the long K 0 S sample. After applying the full selection, the B candidate can still be associated with more than one PV in about 1% of the events. Likewise, about 0.1% of the selected events have several candidates sharing one or more tracks. In these cases, respectively one of the surviving PVs and one of the candidates is used at random.",

The exact values of the shape parameters are determined in the nominal fit. Because of the differences induced by the multivariate selection, the background decay time distribution of the long and downstream K 0 S samples cannot be parametrised using the same background model. For the long K 0 S sample, the background is modelled by two exponential functions, describing a short-lived and a longlived component, respectively. In the downstream K 0 S sample such a short-lived component is not present due to the tighter requirement on the NN classifier output. Its decay time distribution is better described by a single exponential shape corrected by the acceptance function in Eq. (7) with independent parameters (\u03ba , \u03b1 , \u03b2 ). The parameter \u03b2 is set to zero because we also fit the lifetime of the single exponential function itself, and the combination of both parameters would result in ambiguous solutions.",
