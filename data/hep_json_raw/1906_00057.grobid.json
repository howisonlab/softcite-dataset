The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected during 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with expectations from the standard model background. Exclusion limits are set in the context of models of spin-1 heavy vector triplets and of spin-2 bulk gravitons. For massdegenerate W and Z resonances that predominantly couple to the standard model gauge bosons, the mass exclusion at 95% confidence level of heavy vector bosons is extended to 4.5 TeV as compared to 3.8 TeV determined from the best individual channel. This excluded mass increases to 5.0 TeV if the resonances couple predominantly to fermions.",

            "text": "Over the past half century, successive searches for heavy resonances in two-body decays have often led to discoveries of new states. At the CERN LHC, searches for W and Z resonances (collectively referred to as V ) that couple through the electroweak (EW) interaction to standard model (SM) particles have been performed by ATLAS and CMS in final states with two SM bosons [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18], two leptons [19][20][21][22], and two light-flavor [23,24] or heavy-flavor quarks [25][26][27][28][29]. These new states would couple predominantly to either SM fermions, as in the case of minimal W and Z models [30][31][32], or SM bosons, as in strongly coupled composite Higgs and little Higgs models [33][34][35][36][37][38][39]. In addition, models based on warped extra dimensions provide a candidate for a massive resonance, such as the spin-2 first Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton (G) [40][41][42]. In bulk graviton models [43], the SM fermions and gauge bosons are located in the bulk five-dimensional spacetime, and the graviton has a sizable branching fraction to pairs of W, Z, and H bosons.",

The decay products of the SM bosons are therefore highly collimated, requiring dedicated techniques for their identification and reconstruction. In the case of hadronic decays, the pair of quarks produce a single large-cone jet with a two-prong structure. In addition, Higgs bosons can also be identified by tagging the b quarks originating from their decays. In models where heavy vector bosons couple predominantly to fermions, the combined contribution from the leptonic decays W \u2192 \u03bd and Z \u2192 dominates, and these channels [19,20] are included in the combination, providing complementary sensitivity to the searches in diboson channels. The analyses considered in this Letter are based on a data sample of proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-ofmass energy of 1 TeV collected by the CMS experiment in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . A similar combination performed on a comparable set of data has been recently published by ATLAS [45].",

The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum, as determined in the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The dielectron mass resolution for Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.9% when both electrons are in the ECAL barrel, to 2.9% when both electrons are in the endcaps [48]. The momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 7% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [49]. The \u03c4 leptons that decay to hadrons and a neutrino (labeled \u03c4 h ) are reconstructed by combining one or three charged PF candidates with up to two neutral pion candidates [50]. The e, \u03bc, and \u03c4 h with large momenta are required to be isolated from other hadronic activity in the event. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momenta measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies.",

The geometrical overlaps between jets and isolated leptons, and between AK4 jets and the AK8 jet, are handled by assigning the overlapping four-momentum to the lepton, and the AK8 jet, respectively. The four-momenta of the AK4 and AK8 jets are obtained by clustering candidates passing the charged-hadron subtraction algorithm [54]. The contribution of neutral particles originating from additional pp interactions within the same or neighboring bunch crossings (pileup) is proportional to the jet area, and is estimated using the median area method implemented in FastJet, and then subtracted from the jet energy. The jet energy resolution, after the application of corrections to the jet energy, is 4% at 1 TeV [55]. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is computed as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all the PF candidates in an event, and its magnitude is denoted as p miss T [56]. The p miss T is corrected for adjustments to the energy scale of the reconstructed AK4 jets in the event.",

Reconstructing the AK8 jet mass (m j ) and substructure relies on the pileup-per-particle identification algorithm [54,57].

Dedicated mass corrections, obtained from simulation and data in a region enriched with tt events with merged W(qq ) decays, are applied to the jet mass to reduce any residual jet p T dependence [6,60], and to match the jet mass scale and resolution observed in data.

The spin-1 gauge bosons, W and Z , are simulated at leading order (LO) using the MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.4.2 matrix element generator [64], in the heavy vector triplet (HVT) framework [65,66], which introduces a triplet of heavy vector bosons with similar mass, of which one is neutral (Z ) and two are electrically charged (W \u00b1 ). The coupling strength of the heavy vector bosons to SM bosons and fermions is determined from the combinations g H = g V c H and g f = g 2 c F /g V , respectively. The parameter g V is the strength of the new interaction; c H characterizes the interaction between the HVT bosons, the Higgs boson, and longitudinally polarized SM vector bosons; c F represents the direct interaction between the V bosons and the SM fermions; g is the SM SU(2) L gauge coupling constant. The HVT framework is presented in two scenarios, henceforth referred to as model A and model B, depending on the couplings to the SM particles [66]. In the former, the coupling strengths to the SM bosons and fermions are comparable, and the new particles decay primarily to fermions. In the latter, the couplings to the SM fermions are small, and the branching fraction to the SM bosons is nearly 100%. Events are simulated with different m X hypotheses from 800 to 4500 GeV for X decays to bosons, and 800 to 5500 GeV for X decays to leptons, assuming a negligible resonance width compared to the experimental resolution (3-20%). The kinematic distributions of the signal do not depend on the choice of benchmark scenario, and the samples are reweighted according only to the cross sections and branching fractions.",

The dilepton and diboson searches constrain different regions of the parameter space, as the dilepton searches can probe the region where the coupling to the SM bosons approaches zero. In the triplet interpretation, the ratio of the W to Z cross sections is assumed to be determined by the ratio of the partonic luminosities, and to depend only weakly on the model parameters. The fraction of the parameter space where the natural width of the resonances is larger than the average experimental resolution of 5%, and the narrow-width approximation is thus invalid, is also indicated in Fig. 4. In the spin-2 bulk graviton model, the WW, ZZ, and HH channels are combined, setting upper limits of up to 1.1 fb on the cross section of a graviton with mass up to 4.5 TeV. In the \u03ba = 0.5 sce- nario, a graviton with a mass smaller than 850 GeV is excluded at 95% CL, as shown in Fig. 5. Larger \u03ba values increase the production cross sections, but also the graviton natural width, which can be comparable or larger than the experimental resolution. In these cases, the narrow-width approximation is no longer valid.",

The exclusion limits in the bulk graviton model are not directly comparable because of the large \u03ba = 1.0 parameter adopted by ATLAS, which increases the cross section but also implies a non-negligible natural width.   limits of up to 1.1 fb are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of the spin-2 bulk graviton. For models with a triplet of narrow spin-1 resonances, heavy vector bosons with masses below 5.0 and 4.5 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level in models where the W and Z bosons couple predominantly to fermions and bosons, respectively.
