A comprehensive programme to explore the properties of this particle is underway, including measurements of the branching ratios to SM particles and searches for decays into \"exotic\" or non-SM particles. Exotic Higgs boson decays are a powerful probe for physics beyond the SM (BSM). The Higgs boson has a very narrow decay width, so even a small coupling to a non-SM particle could open up a sizeable decay mode. Measurements at the LHC are in agreement with SM predictions, constraining the non-SM branching ratio of the Higgs boson to less than approximately 30% at 95% confidence level (CL) using the 7 and 8 TeV datasets [3][4][5]. Despite this experimental triumph, there is still ample room for exotic Higgs boson decays compatible with observations to date.",

This b-tagging algorithm defines a set of \"b-tagged\" jets. The working point used provides an efficiency to identify jets with b-hadrons from the primary vertex of approximately 77%. The rejection factors are 134 against light-quark and gluon jets, about 6 against jets originating from c-quarks, and about 22 against hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons, as determined in a simulated sample of top-quark pair (tt) events [46,47]. This b-tagging discriminant is used to categorize selected events as discussed in section 5.

Monte Carlo (MC) samples were produced using the full ATLAS detector simulation [49] based on Geant 4 [50]. A faster simulation, where the full Geant 4 simulation of the calorimeter response is replaced by a detailed parameterization of the shower shapes [51], was adopted for some of the samples. To simulate the effects of pile-up, additional interactions were generated using Pythia 8.186 [52] with the A2 set of tuned parameters [53] and the MSTW2008LO [54] parton distribution function (PDF) set, and overlaid on the simulated hard-scatter event. Simulated events were reweighted to match the pile-up conditions observed in the data. All simulated events are processed through the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis chain as the data. In the simulation, the top-quark mass is assumed to be m t = 172.5 GeV. Decays of band c-hadrons were performed by EvtGen v1.2.0 [55], except in samples simulated with the Sherpa event generator [56]. Signal samples of associated Higgs boson production with a W or Z boson, pp \u2192 W H or ZH, were generated with Powheg v2 [57][58][59][60] using the CT10 PDF set [61] at next-toleading order (NLO). The Higgs boson mass is assumed to be m H = 125 GeV. The Higgs boson decay into two spin-zero a-bosons and the subsequent decay of each a-boson into a pair of b-quarks were simulated with Pythia 8.186. The a-boson decay was performed in the narrow-width approximation and the coupling to the b-quarks is assumed to be that of a pseudoscalar. However, since the polarization of the quarks is not observable, this search is insensitive to the chosen parity hypothesis for the a-boson. Pythia 8.186 was also used for the showering, hadronization, and underlying-event (UE) simulation with the A14 tune [62]. The mass of the a-boson was varied for different signal hypotheses in the range 20 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 60 GeV, in 10 GeV mass steps.",

The model used is the SM with an additional dark sector that includes a dark vector boson and a dark Higgs boson [9,65,66]. In this model, the dark Higgs boson, which plays the role of the a-boson, is a scalar under parity transformation and decays promptly. Therefore, the lifetimes of the a-bosons were replaced with values sampled randomly from an exponentially falling distribution with the desired mean value. Signal MC samples were produced for a-boson mean proper lifetimes of 0.1, 1, and 10 mm. Intermediate a-boson lifetimes can be obtained by reweighting these samples. The masses of the a-boson are 20, 30, and 60 GeV. The uneven spacing of a-boson masses is motivated by the fact that the signal kinematics (and therefore acceptance) change significantly between 20 and 30 GeV, but are quite similar from 30 to 60 GeV. The ATLAS fast detector simulation was used for samples of long-lived a-bosons, after verifying that it correctly reproduces the Geant 4-based simulation for the range of a-boson lifetimes under consideration.",

In the case of three b-tagged jets, the peak is due to events where two b-quarks are merged in a single jet or one of the b-quarks is very soft in an asymmetric decay and has a small impact on the kinematics. In the case of events with four b-tagged jets, the invariant masses of the two b-tagged jet pairs are discriminating variables between signal and background. The pairings are chosen to minimize the difference between the invariant masses of the b-tagged jet pairs, and are labelled m bb1 and m bb2 , such that m bb1 > m bb2 .",

In both channels, the average angular separation between b-tagged jets, referred to as average \u2206R(b,b), is typically larger for background events where the b-tagged jets originate from the decays of different particles, such as the two top quarks in tt events. In the single-lepton channel, several additional kinematic variables are included in the BDT discriminant. The H T variable is a measure of the total hadronic energy in the event, which is typically larger for tt than for W H events. The transverse momentum of the W boson, p W T , constructed from the vector sum of the E miss T and the lepton p T , is slightly higher for signal W H events, where the W boson recoils against the Higgs boson, than for background tt events.",

The uncertainties in the normalization are obtained by varying the parameter corresponding to the source of uncertainty under consideration up and down by one standard deviation, while keeping the other nuisance parameters fixed at their central value.   Figures 6 and 7 show the distributions in the control regions of the single-lepton and dilepton channels, respectively, after performing the likelihood fit of these distributions to data assuming \u00b5 = 0. The fit produces better agreement between the data and the background predictions, and it reduces the uncertainties as a result of the nuisance-parameter constraints and the correlations generated by the fit. Figure 8 shows the post-fit background distributions for the signal regions of the dilepton and single-lepton channels. Table 5 compares the observed event yield with the SM background prediction in each signal region, as well as the expected number of signal events for a few representative values of m a .

Summary of the 95% CL upper limits on \u03c3 \u00d7 B(H \u2192 aa \u2192 4b) for (a) the single-lepton channel and (b) the dilepton channel, and (c) the combination of both channels.

In the case of the expected limits, one-and two-standard-deviation uncertainty bands are also displayed. 20 and 60 GeV, as shown in figure 9. The observed (expected) upper limits on \u00b5 for the single-lepton channel range from 2.9 (2.4) pb, for m a = 20 GeV, to 1.6 (0.94) pb, for m a = 60 GeV. For the dilepton channel they range from 1.6 (1.2) pb, for m a = 20 GeV, to 0.54 (0.39) pb for m a = 60 GeV. For comparison, the SM NNLO cross-sections for pp \u2192 W H and ZH are \u03c3 SM (W H) = 1.37 pb and \u03c3 SM (ZH) = 0.88 pb, respectively [104]. Upper limits are derived for the combination of the single-lepton and dilepton channels assuming that the ratio of W H to ZH cross-sections follows the SM prediction. The observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits on \u00b5 range from 3.0 (2.2) pb, for m a = 20 GeV, to 1.3 (0.74) pb, for m a = 60 GeV. The combined result excludes branching ratios as low as 0.45 in the mass range m a between about 25 GeV and 60 GeV, assuming the SM W H and ZH cross-sections. The reduced sensitivity for the lighter a-boson hypotheses, where it is not possible to set limits on the branching ratio, is due to a lower acceptance caused by overlapping b-jets.  Figure 10.

            "text": "This paper presents a search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of spin-zero particles, H \u2192 aa, where the a-boson decays into two b-quarks. The search focuses on processes in which the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W or Z boson that decays leptonically. The analysis uses the pp collision dataset at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 \u00b1 0.8 fb \u22121 . The search for H \u2192 aa \u2192 4b is performed in the mass range 20 GeV \u2264 m a \u2264 60 GeV, considering prompt as well as long-lived a-bosons with mean proper lifetimes c\u03c4 a up to 6 mm. The analysis uses several kinematic variables combined in a multivariate discriminant in signal regions and uses control regions to reduce uncertainties in the background estimates. No significant excess of data is observed relative to the SM predictions. Upper limits at 95% CL are derived for the W H and ZH production crosssection times branching ratio of the decay H \u2192 aa \u2192 4b. The combined observed upper limit for promptly decaying a-bosons ranges from 3.0 pb for m a = 20 GeV to 1.3 pb for m a = 60 GeV, assuming that the ratio of W H to ZH cross-sections follows the SM prediction. For a-bosons with longer proper lifetimes, the best limits are 1.8 pb and 0.68 pb, for m a = 20 GeV and 60 GeV respectively, at c\u03c4 a \u223c 0.4 mm.
