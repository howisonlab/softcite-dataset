The search was performed with deep inelastic scattering events at an ep centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV for exchanged photon virtuality, Q 2 , between 20 and 100 GeV 2 . Contrary to evidence presented for such a state around 1.52 GeV in a previous ZEUS analysis using a sample of 121 pb \u22121 taken in 1996-2000, no resonance peak was found in the p(p)K 0 S invariant-mass distribution in the range 1.45-1.7 GeV. Upper limits on the production cross section are set.",

Such a baryon would be manifestly exotic because of its decay into a K + and a neutron, which is impossible for a three-quark state but could be explained as a bound state of five quarks i.e. a pentaquark state. A narrow baryonic resonance close to the observed mass had previously been predicted in the chiral soliton model [3] and named + with quark configuration uudds. Many experimental groups have looked for this state via various production processes in the decay modes nK + or pK 0 S (pK 0 S ). Some experiments confirmed the signal while others refuted it. Several reviews [4][5][6][7][8] have been published on the subject.",

For this, no MVD information was used for the track selection. At least 40 CTD hits were required for the proton track. The result is shown in Fig. 3(d). The increase of the number of pK 0 S candidates in Fig. 3(d), of an order of magnitude with respect to Fig. 3(c), is mainly due to the looser PID selection for the proton candidates.

Three options were used for the width of the Gaussian. One option was to fix it to 6.1 MeV, which is the measured value from the ZEUS HERA I analysis. In the other two options, the width was set to 1\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 the detector resolution. The resolution of the pK 0 S invariant mass was estimated using the MC events and was 3.5 MeV in the region near 1.52 GeV and 11 MeV near 2.3 GeV. For the mass range shown in Fig. 3(c), the resolution R was parameterised with the following formula; R = 0.00959 M \u2212 0.01111 (GeV). (1) The upper limit on the cross section at 95% confidence level (CL) was determined at the value which increases the \u03c7 2 of the fit by 2.71 [29] with respect to the best fit. 5 At M = 1.52 GeV, where the peak was found in the HERA I analysis [9], the obtained upper limit is 25.8 events for a width of 6.1 MeV. For the HERA I analysis, ZEUS reported 221 \u00b1 48 events above the background. Correcting this number of events for the luminosity and for differences in the event selection and detector efficiencies, dominated by the proton identification, the predicted number of events for this analysis is 286. In Fig. 3(c), a peak of this magnitude with resolution 6.1 MeV is shown as the dashed line above a solid curve which represents the background-only fit. Since no peak is observed at 1.52 GeV, the structure in the HERA I data is assumed to be a background fluctuation.",

The acceptance for the event selection was estimated using cross-section calculations from the MC samples except for the proton PID efficiency, which was determined from the sample. It was assumed that the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the resonance are similar to the \u00b1 (1189) as generated in RAPGAP v.3.1030 [21] and that the resonance decays isotropically to pK 0 S . Since the detection efficiency depends strongly on the (p T , \u03b7) values of the pK 0 S system, some variations on the p T distribution were tested as a study of the systematic uncertainty.",
