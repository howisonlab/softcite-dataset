The subsequent hadronisation process can introduce a charge asymmetry in the production of charm hadrons. This asymmetry is influenced by the valence quarks of the colliding protons, which results in a preference for the c quark to form a meson, e.g. a D \u2212 or D 0 meson. A c quark, on the other hand, can form charm baryons, e.g. a \u039b + c baryon, with the proton's valence quarks. This difference in hadronisation gives rise to different kinematic distributions between charge-conjugated charm hadrons, and therefore results in a charge asymmetry.",

It is difficult to make accurate predictions of the D + s production asymmetry due to the nonperturbative nature of the hadronisation process. Nonetheless, the Lund string fragmentation model [2], implemented in Pythia [3,4], describes hadronisation that can give rise to production asymmetries for heavy flavours [5][6][7]. This model predicts that production asymmetries can be dependent on kinematics due to interactions with the beam remnants. A measurement of the D + s production asymmetry can be used to test nonperturbative QCD models and is an essential input for measurements of direct CP violation in the decays of D + s mesons in LHCb. This paper presents a measurement of the D + s production asymmetry in pp collisions using two data sets corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 fb \u22121 and 2.0 fb \u22121 , recorded by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012, respectively. An inclusive sample of promptly produced D + s mesons in the decay mode D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + is used, where \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 . This sample includes excited states that decay to D + s mesons, such as D * + s mesons which decay to D + s \u03b3 or D + s \u03c0 0 . The inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout this paper, except in the definition of the asymmetries.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data taking and the corresponding data sets (referred to as MagUp and MagDown) are approximately equal in size. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [11], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

Only the small fraction of kaons coming from the nonresonant decays included in the selection can introduce a detection asymmetry, and only when the kinematic distributions of the two oppositely charged kaons are different. In general, the reconstruction efficiency of kaons suffers from a sizeable difference between the interaction cross-sections of K + and K \u2212 mesons with the detector material, which depends on the kaon momentum. For the pair of kaons, however, these differences largely cancel, since the momentum distributions of the positively and negatively charged kaons are very similar. An upper limit of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 is set on their contribution, based on their kinematic overlap and the maximum kaon detection asymmetry as measured with calibration data [25,26]. The pion tracking asymmetry is determined using two different methods, analogously to ref. [26]. The first uses muons from partially reconstructed J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, as described in ref. [27]. The second method uses partially reconstructed D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays with D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , where one of the pions from the D 0 decay does not need to be reconstructed [8]. Both methods have limitations: the former because it does not probe the full detector acceptance or the effect of the hadronic interaction of the pion with the detector material, the latter because it is limited to pions with momenta below 100 GeV/c. The limitations on the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 method are assessed and corrected using simulation. After these corrections, the two methods are in good agreement and the final value of A \u03c0 track is determined by the weighted average of the two methods. For pions with p > 100 GeV/c, A \u03c0 track is determined solely using the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 method combined with the above-mentioned corrections.",

This is done by evaluating the TIS asymmetry separately for candidates that are TOS, triggered by the K + track, and candidates that are TOS, triggered by the K \u2212 track, and then averaging the asymmetry. Due to possible correlations between the signal decay and the rest of the event, this method is biased. In addition, as a result of the coarse transverse segmentation of the hadronic calorimeter, the energy deposited by other particles in the event can increase the energy that is measured and associated to the signal tracks of TOS events.

These are shown for the 7 and 8 TeV data sets separately in table 1. Taking the weighted average of these two results with the systematic uncertainties as fully correlated, the combined value is A P (D + s ) = (\u22120.52 \u00b1 0.13 (stat) \u00b1 0.10 (syst))% , corresponding to a deviation of 3.3 \u03c3 from the hypothesis of no production asymmetry. The results presented here are in agreement with the previous measurement of the D + s production asymmetry [8], obtained using only the 7 TeV data set. A cross-check is performed by measuring A P (D + s ) in two other disjoint regions in the D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + Dalitz plot, analogous to those defined in ref. [26]. These are the region including the K * (892) 0 resonance, and the remaining nonresonant region. The A P (D + s ) measurements in the three regions are in good agreement in all kinematic bins. However, these regions are not included in the measurement of A P (D + s ), since it was found that including them slightly increases the uncertainty on the measurement due to the larger systematic effects from the detection asymmetries.",
