For 3-and 4-jet scenarios, measurements of the minimum azimuthal angles between any two of the three or four leading p T jets are also presented. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS Collaboration at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Calculations based on leading-order matrix elements supplemented with parton showering and hadronization do not fully describe the data, so next-to-leading-order calculations matched with parton shower and hadronization models are needed to better describe the measured distributions. Furthermore, we show that azimuthal jet correlations are sensitive to details of the parton showering, hadronization, and multiparton interactions. A next-to-leading-order calculation matched with parton showers in the MC@NLO method, as implemented in herwig 7, gives a better overall description of the measurements than the powheg method.",

            "text": "Particle jets with large transverse momenta p T are abundantly produced in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC through the strong interactions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) between the incoming partons. When the momentum transfer is large, the dynamics can be predicted using perturbative techniques (pQCD). The two final-state partons at leading order (LO) in pQCD are produced back-to-back in the transverse plane, and thus the azimuthal angular separation between the two highestp T jets, \u0394\u03c6 1,2 = |\u03c6 jet1 \u2212 \u03c6 jet2 |, equals \u03c0 . The production of additional highp T jets leads to a deviation of the azimuthal angle from \u03c0 . The measurement of azimuthal angular correlations (or decorrelation from \u03c0 ) in inclusive 2-jet topologies is a useful tool to test theoretical predictions of multijet production processes. Previous meae-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch surements of azimuthal correlation in inclusive 2-jet events were reported by the D0 Collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron [1,2], and by the ATLAS Collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [3] and the CMS Collaboration in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [4,5] at the LHC. Multijet correlations have been measured by the ATLAS Collaboration at \u221a s = 8 TeV [6,7]. This paper reports measurements of the normalized inclusive 2-, 3-, and 4-jet cross sections as a function of the azimuthal angular separation between the two highest p T (leading) jets,",

The measurements cover the region \u03c0/2 < \u0394\u03c6 1,2 \u2264 \u03c0 ; the region \u0394\u03c6 1,2 \u2264 \u03c0/2 includes large backgrounds due to tt and Z/W+jet(s) events. Experimental and theoretical uncertainties are reduced by normalizing the \u0394\u03c6 1,2 distribution to the total dijet cross section within each region of p max T . For 3-and 4-jet topologies, measurements of the normalized inclusive 3-and 4-jet cross sections are also presented as a function of the minimum azimuthal angular separation between any two of the three or four highest p T jets, \u0394\u03c6 min 2j , 1 \u03c3 d\u03c3 d\u0394\u03c6 min 2j , for several regions of p max T , for |y| < 2.5. This observable, which is infrared safe (independent of additional soft radiation), is especially suited for studying correlations amongst the jets in multijet events: the maximum value of \u0394\u03c6 min 2j is 2\u03c0/3 for 3-jet events (the \"Mercedes star\" configuration), while it is \u03c0/2 in the 4-jet case (corresponding to the \"cross\" configuration). The cross section for small angular separations is suppressed because of the finite jet sizes for a particular jet algorithm. The observable \u0394\u03c6 min 2j is sensitive to the contributions of jets with lower p T than the leading jet, i.e. the subleading jets, and one can distinguish nearby (nearly collinear) jets (at large \u0394\u03c6 min 2j ) from other additional high p T jets (small \u0394\u03c6 min 2j ), yielding information additional to that of the \u0394\u03c6 1,2 observable. The 4-jet cross section differential in \u0394\u03c6 min 2j has also been measured by the ATLAS Collaboration [7].",

The pythia 8 [9] and her-wig++ [10] event generators are used, both based on LO 2 \u2192 2 matrix element calculations. The pythia 8 event generator simulates parton showers ordered in p T and uses the Lund string model [11] for hadronization, while herwig++ generates parton showers through angular-ordered emissions and uses a cluster fragmentation model [12] for hadronization. The contribution of multiparton interactions (MPI) is simulated in both pythia 8 and herwig++, but the number of generated MPI varies between pythia 8 and herwig++ MPI simulations. The MPI parameters of both generators are tuned to measurements in proton-proton collisions at the LHC and proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron [13], while the hadronization parameters are determined from fits to LEP data. For pythia 8 the CUETP8M1 [13] tune, which is based on the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [14,15], is employed, while for herwig++ the CUETHppS1 tune [13], based on the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [16], is used. The MadGraph [17,18] event generator provides LO matrix element calculations with up to four outgoing partons, i.e. 2 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 3, and 2 \u2192 4 diagrams. It is interfaced to pythia 8 with tune CUETP8M1 for the implementation of parton showers, hadronization, and MPI. In order to match with pythia 8 the k T -MLM matching procedure [19] with a matching scale of 14 GeV is used to avoid any double counting of the parton configurations generated within the matrix element calculation and the ones simulated by the parton shower. The NNPDF2.3LO PDF set is used for the hard-process calculation.",

The powheg generator is used in the NLO dijet mode [26], referred to as ph-2j, as well as in the NLO three-jet mode [27], referred to as ph-3j, both using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set [28]. The powheg generator, referred to as ph-2j-lhe, is also used in the NLO dijet mode without parton showers and MPI. A minimum p T for real parton emission of 10 GeV is required for the ph-2j predictions, and similarly for the ph-3j predictions a minimum p T for the three final-state partons of 10 GeV is imposed. To simulate the contributions due to parton showers, hadronization, and MPIs, the ph-2j is matched to pythia 8 with tune CUETP8M1 and herwig++ with tune CUETHppS1, while the ph-3j is matched only to pythia 8 with tune CUETP8M1. The matching between the powheg matrix element calculations and the pythia 8 underlying event (UE) simulation is performed using the shower-veto procedure, which rejects showers if their transverse momentum is greater than the minimal p T of all final-state partons simulated in the matrix element (parameter pthard = 2 [26]). Predictions from the herwig 7 event generator are based on the MMHT2014 PDF set [29] and the default tune H7-UE-MMHT [23] for the UE simulation.

Five such triggers are considered that require at least one jet in an event with p T > 140, 200, 320, 400, or 450 GeV in the full rapidity coverage of the CMS detector. All triggers are prescaled except the one with the highest threshold. Table 2 shows the integrated luminosity L for the five trigger samples. The relative efficiency of each trigger is estimated using triggers with lower p T thresholds. Using these five jet energy thresholds, a 100% trigger efficiency is achieved in the region of p max T > 200 GeV. Particles are reconstructed and identified using a particleflow (PF) algorithm [32], which uses an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. Jets are reconstructed by clustering the Lorentz vectors of the PF candidates with the infrared-and collinear-safe anti-k T clustering algorithm [33] with a distance parameter R = 0.4. The clustering is performed with the FastJet package [34]. The technique of charged-hadron subtraction [35] is used to remove tracks identified as originating from additional pp interactions within the same or neighbouring bunch crossings (pileup). The average number of pileup interactions observed in the data is about 27.",

An offset correction is required to account for the extra energy clustered into jets due to pileup. The JES corrections, which depend on the \u03b7 and p T of the jet, are applied as multiplicative factors to the jet four-momentum vectors.

The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the objects determined by a jet finding algorithm [33,34] applied to all charged tracks associated with the vertex plus the corresponding associated missing transverse momentum. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like signatures originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. Stringent criteria [38] are applied to suppress these nonphysical signatures; each jet should contain at least two particles, one of which is a charged hadron, and the jet energy fraction carried by neutral hadrons and photons should be less than 90%. These criteria have a jet selection efficiency greater than 99% for genuine jets.",

In the 2-jet case the \u0394\u03c6 1,2 distributions are strongly peaked at \u03c0 and become steeper with increasing p max T . In the 3-jet case, the \u0394\u03c6 1,2 distributions become flatter at \u03c0 , since by definition dijet events do not contribute, and in the 4-jet case they The solid band around unity represents the total experimental uncertainty and the error bars on the points represent the statistical uncertainties in the simulated data. Among the LO dijet event generators, herwig++ exhibits the largest deviations from the experimental measurements, whereas pythia 8 behaves much better than herwig++, although with deviations of up to 30-40%, in particular around \u0394\u03c6 1,2 = 5\u03c0/6 in the 2-jet case and around \u0394\u03c6 1,2 < 2\u03c0/3 in the 3-and 4-jet case. Predictions from herwig++ tend to overestimate the measurements as a function of \u0394\u03c6 1,2 in the 2-, 3-, and 4jet cases, especially at \u0394\u03c6 1,2 < 5\u03c0/6 for p max T > 400 GeV. However, it is remarkable that predictions based on the 2 \u2192 2 matrix element calculations supplemented with parton showers, MPI, and hadronization describe the \u0394\u03c6 1,2 distributions rather well, even in regions that are sensitive to hard jets not included in the matrix element calculations.

The solid band around unity represents the total experimental uncertainty and the vertical bars on the points represent the statistical uncertainties in the simulated data. The predictions of ph-2j and ph-3j exhibit deviations from the measurement, increasing towards small \u0394\u03c6 1,2 . While ph-2j is above the data, ph-3j predicts too few events at small \u0394\u03c6 1,2 . These deviations were investigated in a dedicated study with parton showers and MPI switched off. Because of the kinematic restriction of a 3-parton state, ph-2j without parton showers cannot fill the region \u0394\u03c6 1,2 < 2\u03c0/3, shown as ph-2j-lhe with the dashed line in Fig. 7, whereas for ph-3j the parton showers have little impact. Thus, the events at low \u0394\u03c6 1,2 observed for ph-2j originate from leading-log parton showers, and there are too many of these. In contrast, the ph-3j prediction, which provides 2 \u2192 3 jet calculations at NLO QCD, is below the measurement. The NLO ph-2j calculation and the LO powheg three-jet calculation are equivalent when initial-and final-state radiation are not allowed to occur.",
