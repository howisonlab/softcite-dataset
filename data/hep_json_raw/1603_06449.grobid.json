            "text": "Electromagnetic bremsstrahlung is widely used in various applications. They range from medicine to advanced methods in structural research. In high energy physics the bremsstrahlung photons were used, inter alia, to study photoproduction -see for example [1]. With advent of HERA, it became a very attractive tool. On one hand the bremsstrahlung events are characterised by a simple and easy to register final state, and on the other hand, in the HERA energy range, the process cross-section is relatively large and precisely calculable. Therefore, bremsstrahlung was used to determine the machine absolute and instantaneous luminosities and in addition it served as an efficient beam diagnostic and monitoring tool (see [2,3]). The measurements exploited the basic properties of the final state: an approximate energy conservation as well as the angular properties of radiated photons.",

            "text": "In 2011, Khoze et al. [4] postulated an extension of the LHC physics programme with the observation of the high energy photon radiated in the elastic proton-proton scattering event -the study of exclusive diffractive bremsstrahlung. The measurements of exclusive diffractive bremsstrahlung can be considered as complementary to the luminometers a e-mail: Janusz.Chwastowski@ifj.edu.pl and luminosity monitors proposed in [5,6]. It is also worth noting that this process has never been studied at high energies. The difference with respect to the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung is that the interaction is mediated by an exchange of a pomeron. In both electromagnetic and diffractive processes the exchange is colourless and soft, and the sum of the radiated photon and the scattered proton energies is nearly equal to the beam energy. The calculations of [4] were considerably extended by Lebiedowicz and Szczurek [7] who also introduced the proton formfactor into the calculations. However, the values of the parameters in their model are based on an educated guess and are subject to experimental verification. The authors of [7] used the Donnachie and Landshoff parameterisation [8] with linear pomeron trajectory with the intercept 1.0808 and the slope \u03b1 IP = 0.25 GeV \u22122 . The elastic scattering slope evolution is given by B(s) = B N N IP + 2 \u2022 \u03b1 IP ln s/s 0 where s 0 = 1 GeV 2 and B N N IP = 9 GeV \u22122 . P. Lebiedowicz and A. Szczurek considered also other mechanisms leading to the p p \u03b3 final state, for example electromagnetic bremsstrahlung and the virtual photon rescattering. They concluded that these processes do not play a very important role and can be safely neglected when considering the forward directions. For a full account of the model details and its parameters an interested reader is referred to original publications.",

It is quite clear that the acceptance of the detectors depends on both the properties of the magnetic spectrometer and the position of the detector in the beam pipe. The latter is quantified by a crucial parameter -the distance between the detector active edge and the beam. One should also note that in principle a given event can have a single or double tag signature denoting one or two scattered forward protons.

In the case of the radiating proton accelerated to the energy of 6500 GeV, this angle is of the order of 144 \u00b5rad, which corresponds to the photon pseudorapidity, 3 \u03b7 \u2248 9.5. One should also note that the scattered proton angular distribution is also extremely narrow due to the large value of the nuclear slope parameter at high energies and its average value is \u223c 1/4\u03b3 at the LHC energies. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the polar angle of the bremsstrahlung photon. In Fig. 3 the distribution of the radiating proton relative energy loss, \u03be , versus its transverse momentum, p T is shown. The photon energy spectrum (not shown) is of a typical shape (\u223c 1/E \u03b3 ) and that of the proton relative energy loss is proportional to 1/\u03be . The final state particles are emitted in the forward directions. For the LHC running with \u03b2 = 0.55 m it is impossible to register the elastically scattered protons with the help of the AFP stations. Therefore, the signal signature is defined as the two-particle final state with a photon registered in the ZDC and the scattered proton in the AFP located in the photon hemisphere. Moreover, their reconstructed energies have to fulfill relation (1). The energy range of the scattered proton, and hence also Fig. 3 The distribution of the radiating proton relative energy loss, \u03be , versus its transverse momentum, p T of the photon, is defined by the machine optics and location of the AFP detectors.",

            "text": "The signal visible cross-section predicts that the rate of the diffractive bremsstrahlung events within the considered phase space varies between 0.1 Hz to about 100 Hz for the instantaneous luminosity increasing from 10 29 cm \u22122 s \u22121 to 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 assuming that the luminosity is evenly distributed among all bunches. Moreover, the above results were obtained with an implicit assumption of a single interaction per bunch crossing 5 . Usually, the LHC runs with much larger instantaneous luminosity and several pp interactions per bunch crossing can happen. Therefore, the visible crosssections have to be multiplied by the probability of no pp interactions to calculate the pile-up-free rate. The reduction factor depends on the machine delivered luminosity and is negligible at luminosities below 10 30 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , reaches the value of about 0.9 for luminosity of 10 31 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , the value of about 0.4 for \u223c 4 \u2022 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and s rapidly decreases with increasing instantaneous luminosity. This limits the useful range of luminosities for the diffractive bremsstrahlung measurement. Therefore, one should use the data collected in special LHC runs for which the average number of pp collisions per bunch crossing is smaller than one. Such runs are typically dedicated to the forward physics and taken annually. The visible cross-section implies the collection of the diffractive bremsstrahlung samples of a few thousand to several thousand events in a 10-h long LHC run dedicated to the discussed measurement.",

The authors concluded that the photons can be used to tag the elastic events which in turn can be used to measure the p T dependence of the elastic cross-section as well as the ratio of the elastic to total cross-section.",
