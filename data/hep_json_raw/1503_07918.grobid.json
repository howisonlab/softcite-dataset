Recently, Jonathan Davis claimed that the DAMA modulation may be interpreted on the basis of the neutron scattering events induced by the muons and neutrinos together. We tried to simulate the neutron backgrounds at the Gran Sasso and Yangyang laboratory with and without the polyethylene shielding to quantify the effects of the ambient neutrons on the direct detection experiments based on the crystals.",

However, it is still unknown what the dark matter is. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are one of the most attractive dark matter particle candidates [3,4]. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a possible WIMP candidate theoretically hypothesized beyond the standard model of particle physics. There have been a number of experiments that directly search for WIMPs in our galaxy by looking for WIMP-nucleus scattering through nuclear recoil [5,6].",

Except for the DAMA experiment, the indications of WIMP-like signals are not significant at the <3\u03c3 confidence level, and the same experimental groups or independent groups are planning to confirm these signals. However, the result from the DAMA experiment has attracted attention because the observation of an annual modulation of WIMP-like signals with a significance of 9.2\u03c3 has been reported. This finding has spurred a continuing debate concerning the observation of WIMPs over the past 15 years. The WIMP-nucleon cross sections inferred from the DAMA modulation are in conflict with limits from other experiments that directly measure the nuclear recoil signals, such as XENON100 [17], LUX [18], and SuperCDMS [19]. However, it is possible to explain all these experimental results without conflict because of nontrivial systematic differences in detector responses [20,21] and the commonly used astronomical model for the WIMP distribution [22].",

More specifically, the events are composed of neutrons, which are liberated in the material surrounding the detector by a combination of 8B solar neutrinos and atmospheric muons [7]. The DAMA group disagreed with Davis's claim because the induced modulation amplitudes from neutrons induced by muons and by neutrinos are less than 9 \u00d710 \u22126 cpd/kg/keV (2 \u00d710 \u22125 cpd/kg/keV for neutrons produced in the lead shield) and less than 2 \u00d710 \u22126 cpd/kg/keV, respectively from the simulation, and they are less than 0.1% of the modulation amplitude measured by DAMA/LIBRA [11]. Further, Barbeau et al criticized Davis's claim because a seven order of magnitude discrepancy in the neutron contribution was required [14].",

Figure 3 shows the neutron energy spectra at the boundary between the rock and cavern, obtained from the simulation of muon propagation and interaction with materials in the rock. There are four different shielding configurations inside the cavern, denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4, defined in section 3.4, therefore, we can see the effect of the neutrons reflected back from the wall and shielding materials inside the cavern. Most are dominant below \u223c1 MeV and it depends on the outmost shield layer whether it is polyethylene (PE) or not.",

The order of lead and PE shield layers was switched for configuration 2. The shielding effect was also tested with a lead shield only (configuration 3). Figure 4 shows shielded detector geometries for KIMS-NaI (left) and DAMA (right) setups. For the KIMS-NaI setup (configuration 4), 5 cm thick PE was put inside a lead shield and MD outside the lead shield, which is a muon detector filled with mineral oil (liquid paraffin). We expect that 30 cm thick MD can also shield neutrons as much as the PE shield did in the configuration 1. However, neutrons can also be produced by muon interaction with shielding materials and should be considered in configuring shield layers. Figure 5 (left) shows the primary vertex positions of neutrons in the x-y plane of the shielding configuration 1, and it is found to be dense in the lead and copper shields. The right side of Figure 5 shows neutron energy spectra at boundaries between different shield layers. We defined three different boundaries: rock/cavern (thick black line), outside copper shield (thin red line), and between copper and target crystals inside (dotted blue line). From the neutron spectra we found that the neutrons are built up in the lead and copper shields. To quantify the effects of neutrons with and without PE inside the lead shield we tested neutron energy spectra at boundaries with configuration 2, in which we changed the order of shield layers of PE and lead, as explained earlier. As shown in Figure 6 neutrons below \u223c10 MeV are reduced dramatically between PE and the copper shield. Therefore, it is more effective to shield neutrons below \u223c10 MeV by putting the PE shield inside the lead.",

There is little difference between configuration 1 and 3 for neutrons below \u223c0.1 MeV. If we consider the order of magnitude difference in muon fluxes at the depths of Gran Sasso and Y2L, the shielding effect with configuration 2 is very similar to the result with configuration 4, which used 5 cm thick PE inside the lead shield and 30 cm thick MD instead of PE in configuration 1. As shown in the left of Figure 7, even 5 cm thick PE inside the lead is effective to shield neutrons below \u223c1 MeV. Accordingly, 30 cm thick PE inside the lead shield (configuration 2) is the most effective in shielding intermediate neutrons compared to other configurations.",

            "text": "From the simulation studies described in sections 3.3 and 3.4, we obtained the neutron flux at the boundaries of the shield layers and tested the shielding effect in each shielding material. We now consider the nuclear recoil event in NaI crystals due to neutron backgrounds. Because we have 5\u00d75 segmented NaI crystals an event can deposit its energy in two or more crystals. Therefore, we call an event a single hit event when it deposits the energy in a single NaI crystal and a multiple hit event when it exhibits energy deposition in two or more NaI crystals. Figure 8 shows the spectra of energy deposited in NaI crystals, which include not only nuclear recoil but also electromagnetic energy deposition. The thick black line represents all events that deposited energy in the NaI crystal and the dotted black line represents single hit events. The green color represents energy deposited by all nuclear recoil events, and the blue color represents results for nuclear recoil single events only. The nuclear recoil events contribute only at the lowest energies. Figure 8 is obtained from the simulation with shielding configuration 1 at Gran Sasso, and for nuclear recoil single hit events it is much lower than the 10 \u22124 cpd level for energies below 100 keV (inset). The left of Figure 9 shows the spectra of visible energy deposited by all single hit events (dotted black line), using configuration 1. The thick blue line represents results from nuclear recoil single hit events only. A nuclear recoil event yields a lower number of scintillation photons than an electron recoil events for the same energy deposition. Measurements of the quenching factors for Na and I recoils in NaI(Tl) crystals have been reported and are \u223c25 and \u223c10%, respectively [38]. Therefore, we applied 0.25 and 0.1 as quenching factors for Na and I in the simulation. The right graph in Figure 9 depicts the relationship between nuclear recoil energy and neutron kinetic energy as a scatter plot, and the Na and I recoils are separated. Table 1 shows the summarized results for single hit event rates for the four shielding configurations. Single hit events include electromagnetic energy deposition as well as nuclear recoil energy deposition. The single hit event rates by the nuclear recoil event only are also obtained.",

The blue histogram is obtained from nuclear recoil single hit events, and the dotted black histogram results from single hit events, including electromagnetic energy deposition as well as nuclear recoil. Quenching factors, 0.25 and 0.1, for Na and I are applied in the simulation. The correlation between neutron energy and nuclear recoil energy is shown as a scatter plot (right).",
