Differential cross sections are presented as functions of up to three observables that describe the jet kinematics and the jet activity. Correlations between the azimuthal directions and the rapidities of the jets and the Z boson are studied in detail. The predictions of a number of multileg generators with leading or next-to-leading order accuracy are compared with the measurements. The comparison shows the importance of including multi-parton contributions in the matrix elements and the improvement in the predictions when nextto-leading order terms are included.",

            "text": "The high centre-of-mass energy of proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC produces events with large jet transverse momenta (p T ) and high jet multiplicities in association with a Z/\u03b3 * boson. For convenience Z/\u03b3 * is denoted as Z. The selection of events in which the Z boson decays into two oppositely charged electrons or muons provides a signal sample that is not significantly contaminated by background processes. This decay channel can be reconstructed with high efficiency due to the presence of charged leptons in the final state and is well suited for the validation of calculations within the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, the production of massive vector bosons with jets is an important background to a number of standard model (SM) processes (single top and tt production, vector boson fusion, WW scattering, Higgs boson production) as well as searches for physics beyond the SM. A good understanding of this background is vital to these searches and measurements. Perturbative QCD calculations of the differential cross sections involve different powers of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s and different kinematic JHEP04 (2017)022scales and are therefore technically challenging. The issue has been addressed over the last 15 years by merging processes with different parton multiplicities before the parton showering, initially at tree level, and more recently with matrix elements calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) using multileg matrix-element (ME) event generators [1,2].",

The jets are defined using the infrared and collinear safe anti-k t algorithm applied to all visible particles; the radius parameter is set to 0.5 [9]. The four-momenta of the particles are summed and therefore the jets can be massive. The differential cross sections include only those jets with transverse momentum greater than 30 GeV and further than R = 0.5 from the leptons in the (\u03b7, \u03c6)-plane, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. In addition, the absolute jet rapidity is required to be smaller than 2.4. The jets are referred to as 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , etc. according to their transverse momenta, starting with the highest-p T jet, and denoted as j 1 , j 2 , j 3 , etc. To further investigate the QCD dynamics towards low Bjorken-x values, multidimensional differential cross sections are measured for Z + \u2265 1 jet production in an extended phase space with jet rapidities up to 4.7. The extension of the rapidity coverage from 2.4 to 4.7 is used to tag events from vector boson fusion (e.g., Higgs production). Typically, the Z + jets events constitute a background for such processes, and a good understanding of their production differential cross section including jets in the forward region is important.",

For the leading jet a double differential cross section is measured as a function of its absolute rapidity and transverse momentum. Correlations in the jet kinematics are studied with one-dimensional and multidimensional differential cross section measurements, via 1) the distributions in the azimuthal angles between the Z boson and the leading jet and between the two leading jets, and 2) the rapidity distributions of the Z boson and the leading jet. These two rapidities are used as variables of a three-dimensional differential cross section measurement together with the transverse momentum of the jet. The Lorentz boost along the beam axis introduces a large correlation amongst the Z boson and the jet rapidities. The two rapidities are combined to form a variable uncorrelated with the event boost along the beam axis, y diff = 0.5 |y(Z) \u2212 y(j i )| and a highly boost-dependent variable, JHEP04(2017)022 y sum = 0.5 |y(Z) + y(j i )|. The cross section is measured separately as a function of each of these variables. The distribution of y diff is mostly sensitive to the parton scattering, while y sum is expected to be sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton.",

It is particularly important when the Z boson has a large transverse momentum, leading to a large missing transverse energy. The azimuthal angle between the jets is a good handle to suppress backgrounds coming from QCD multijet events, while the H T variable can be used to select events with large jet activity. For such analyses it is important to have a good model of Z + jets production and therefore a good understanding of these observables. This motivates the measurement of the distributions of the azimuthal angles between the jets and between the Z boson and the jets for different thresholds applied to the Z boson transverse momentum, the H T variable, and the jet multiplicity. These angles can be measured with high precision, and thus provide an excellent avenue to test the accuracy of SM predictions [10]. The dijet mass is an essential observable in the selection of Higgs boson events produced by vector boson fusion and it is important to model well both this process and its backgrounds. This observable is measured in Z + jets events for the two leading jets. Section 2 describes the experimental setup and the data samples used for the measurements, while the object reconstruction and the event selection are presented in section 3. Section 4 is dedicated to the subtraction of the background contribution and the correction of the detector response, and section 5 to the estimation of the measurement uncertainties. Finally, the results are presented and compared to different theoretical predictions in section 6 and summarised in section 7.",

The resulting uncertainties range from 0.26% to 5.6% depending on the jet multiplicity. The uncertainty from the pileup subtraction performed in the forward region, |y| > 2.5, is estimated by varying up and down the pileup fraction f PU described in section 4 by half the difference from the value obtained in the simulation. In the region covered by the tracker and where no correction is applied, it is verified that the jet multiplicity does not depend on the number of vertices reconstructed in the event. This indicates that the jets from pileup events have a negligible impact on the measurement. The unfolding procedure has an uncertainty due to its dependence on the simulation used to estimate the response matrix (Unf sys) and to the finite size of the simulation sample (Unf stat). The first contribution is estimated using an alternative event generator, sherpa 1.4 [34], and taking the difference between the two results to represent the uncertainty. The distribution obtained with the alternative generator differs sufficiently from the nominal one to cover the differences with the data. The statistical uncertainty in the response matrix is analytically propagated to the unfolded result [31]. When added in quadrature and depending on the kinematic variable and jet multiplicity, the total unfolding uncertainty varies up to 10%.",

Figure 2 shows the cross section for both inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicities and the numbers are compared with the prediction obtained with mg5 amc + pythia 8 in table 3 for the exclusive case. The agreement with the predictions is very good for jet multiplicities up to the maximum number of final-state partons included in the ME calculations, namely three for mg5 amc + pythia 8 and four for both MadGraph 5 + pythia 6 and sherpa 2. The level of precision of the measurement does not allow us to probe the improvement expected from the additional NLO terms. The cross section is reduced by a factor of five for each additional jet. The predictions already agree well at tree level (MadGraph 5 + pythia 6) renormalised to the NNLO inclusive cross section. For N jets = 4, the mg5 amc + pythia 8 calculation, which does not include this jet multiplicity in the matrix elements, predicts a different cross section from those that do. The predictions that include four jets in the matrix elements are in better agreement with the data, but the difference between the predictions is limited to roughly one standard deviation of the measurement uncertainty. The large uncertainty is due to the sensitivity of the jet p T threshold acceptance to the jet energy scale. The sherpa 2 prediction for N jets = 5 is closer to the measurement than MadGraph 5 + pythia 6, while neither of these includes this multiplicity in the ME calculations. The theoretical uncertainty shown in the figure for the mg5 amc + pythia 8 prediction uses the standard method described in the previous subsection. In the case of the exclusive jet multiplicity, the presence of large logarithms in the perturbative calculation can lead to an underestimate of this uncertainty, so the Steward and Tackmann prescription (ST) provides a better estimate [47].

Figure 18 shows the differential cross section measurements as a function of the azimuthal angle between the Z boson and the leading jet for three different jet multiplicities. The inclusion of several parton multiplicities in the ME calculations ensures that the Monte Carlo predictions model the data well even at tree level and small differences in azimuthal angles. Differences are observed between tree-level (MadGraph 5 + pythia 6) and multileg NLO (sherpa 2 and mg5 amc + pythia 8) predictions, the latter being closer to the measurement, but the difference is smaller than one standard deviation in the experimental uncertainties. As the jet multiplicity increases, the \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 1 ) distribution flattens out. In an event dominated by the leading jet, the jet is recoiling against the Z boson, resulting in a strong peak at \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 1 ) \u03c0. As the jet activity increases the Z boson recoils against a combination of several jets and this peak broadens, leading to an overall flattening of the distribution.   Figure 17.

The results are shown in figures 20-23. The agreement of the predictions with the data is preserved, but the tree-level prediction computed with MadGraph 5 + pythia 6 is an overestimate compared to the data at low azimuthal angle for the leading jet. The distributions are more uniform than in the \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 1 ) case, but retain a peak close to \u03c0. In the \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 2 ) case, we also see that the distributions show a larger correlation and a peak emerges at approximately \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 2 ) \u2248 2.6. This peak becomes more pronounced as the p T (Z) threshold increases. A similar trend is seen in the \u2206\u03c6(Z, j 3 ) distribution: selecting a high Z boson p T increases the fraction of events where the jets recoil against the boson.",

The \u2206\u03c6 (Z, j 2 ) and \u2206\u03c6 (Z, j 3 ) distributions are also flatter than the corresponding distributions with no H T cut.

This region is sensitive to the transition from an area of hadronic activity being resolved as one jet to being resolved as two jets. Increasing the p T (Z) threshold value to 150 GeV ( figure 26) shows that the splitting of jets in this case is the dominant feature in the three distributions. Events where a dijet system radiates a Z boson are thus largely suppressed and this is most evident in the \u2206\u03c6 (j 1 , j 2 ) distribution, where the peak at \u03c0 is gone. A further increase in the p T (Z) threshold to 300 GeV (figure 27) continues this trend. In all cases, the agreement between the measurement and the prediction is still very good. Overall, the measurements show that Monte Carlo predictions offer a very good description of the azimuthal angles between the jets and the Z boson, achieved when several parton multiplicities are included in the ME calculations and matched with parton showering.",

The rapidity distributions of the Z boson and jets are fairly well modelled by the generators, but the correlations between the rapidities, which have been studied by measuring multidimensional differential cross sections and distributions of rapidity differences and sums, are not well reproduced by the multileg tree-level calculation. We have shown that the multileg event generators including NLO terms reproduce the rapidity difference distributions very well. The rapidity sum is also successfully described. For this variable the discrepancy with the tree-level calculation could also be due to a different choice of the parton distribution functions.",
