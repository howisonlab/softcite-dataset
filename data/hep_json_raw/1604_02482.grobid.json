Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are complicated and depend on the neutrino beam energy, the neutrino-nucleus interaction, and the structure of the nucleus. Knowledge of the incident neutrino energy spectrum and neutrino-detector interactions are crucial for analyzing neutrino oscillation experiments. The ArgoNeut liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (lArTPC) observed charged-current neutrino-argon scattering events with two protons back-to-back in the final state (\"hammer\" events) which they associated with shortrange correlated (SRC) nucleon-nucleon pairs. The large volume MicroBoone lArTPC will measure far more of these unique events.",

The missing transverse momentum distribution is slightly smaller than the observed p T miss \u2265 0.3 GeV/c. This discrepancy could be due to either statistical fluctuations in the four measured hammer events or to rescattering of the outgoing protons, which is not included in our model. We also calculated the expected results for an incident neutrino energy of 4 GeV, comparable to the average energy of the ArgoNeut neutrino beam. The primary differences between these results and the ones shown in the Figs. 2 and 3, are that the reaction at these higher neutrino energies covers a much larger range of energy and momentum transfer and a significantly wider range in W . However, the proton spectra (Figs. 4-6) are remarkably similar for the two sets of incident enutrino energies. The two protons are predominantly back-to-back, with momenta peaked at about 500 MeV/c and the same p T miss distribution. We also compared these distributions to those from the second reaction model, where the incident neutrino scatters from a nucleon, exciting it to a resonance (N * or \u2206), which then deexcites by colliding with a second nucleon, e.g., \u2206N \u2192 pp. This model generates a nucleon with initial momentum according to the 12 C Argonne V18 momentum distribution [15]. It generates the initial electron energy by randomly sampling from the MiniBoone neutrino energy distribution [16]. It then generates the scattered electron energy and angles. It assumes that the inclusive \u2206 production cross section has the same invariant mass (W ) dependence as the eN \u2192 e\u03c0N cross section averaged over all outgoing pion momenta. It then generates a second nucleon randomly, and calculates the two-nucleon \u2206N \u2192 pp distribution randomly by phase space.",

(a) The electron scatters from a first nucleon, which emits a pion, typically after resonance excitation (not shown). The pion is absorbed by two nucleons, which are detected. (b) The electron scatters from a first nucleon, exciting it to a resonance, which deexcites via \u2206N \u2192 pp. The diagrams for the corresponding charged current neutrino interactions A(\u03bd, \u00b5pp) would replace the incident electron with a neutrino, the outgoing electron with a muon, and the exchanged virtual photon with a W .",
