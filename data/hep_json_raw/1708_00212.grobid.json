The data analysis uses 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data are found to be consistent with the expected Standard Model background. The observed (expected -assuming Standard Model pp \u2192 H \u2192 Z\u03b3 production and decay) upper limit on the production cross section times the branching ratio for pp \u2192 H \u2192 Z\u03b3 is 6.6. (5.2) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. In addition, upper limits are set on the production cross section times the branching ratio as a function of the mass of a narrow resonance between 250 GeV and 2.4 TeV, assuming spin-0 resonances produced via gluon-gluon fusion, and spin-2 resonances produced via gluongluon or quark-antiquark initial states. For high-mass spin-0 resonances, the observed (expected) limits vary between 88 fb (61 fb) and 2.8 fb (2.7 fb) for the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV at the 95% confidence level.",

Searches for heavy Z\u03b3 resonances were carried out by the D0 Collaboration at the Tevatron and by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The D0 Collaboration set upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X) \u2022 B(X \u2192 Z\u03b3) ranging from 2.5 (3.1) pb for a scalar (vector) X mass of 140 GeV to 0.19 (0.20) pb for a mass of 600 GeV [20] using about 1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The AT-LAS Collaboration excluded technimesons decaying to Z\u03b3 for technimeson masses between 200 and 700 GeV and between 750 and 890 GeV, and composite spin-0 resonances decaying to Z\u03b3 for most of the resonance mass range between 200 GeV and 1.18 TeV for certain model parameters using pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV [21]. Using 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV, the ATLAS Collaboration set limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X)\u2022B(X \u2192 Z\u03b3) between 295 fb and 8.2 fb for spin-0 resonances produced in gluongluon fusion for a X mass range from 250 GeV to 2.75 TeV using leptonic and hadronic Z boson decays [22]. The CMS Collaboration set upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X) \u2022 B(X \u2192 Z\u03b3) between about 300 fb and about 2.5 fb for spin-0 resonances produced in gluon-gluon fusion for a mass range of 200 GeV to 3 TeV using leptonic and hadronic Z decays and pp collision data taken at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV [23]. This article presents improved searches for decays of the Higgs boson to Z\u03b3 as well as for narrow high-mass resonances decaying to Z\u03b3 using Z boson decays to electron or muon pairs. The Z(\u2192 )\u03b3 final state can be reconstructed completely and with high efficiency, good invariant mass resolution, and relatively small backgrounds. It is therefore a powerful experimental signature. The main background is the non-resonant production of Z bosons in conjunction with photons, which is modelled using samples of simulated events. A smaller contribution arises from Z boson production together with hadronic jets when a jet is misidentified as a photon. This background is studied with a dedicated selection of the photon candidate. Both searches are based on pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015 and 2016, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The search for decays of the Higgs boson to Z\u03b3 benefits from the increased Higgs production cross section due to the increased centreof-mass energy and also from the larger data set compared to the previous search [18]. In addition, the event categorisation now includes a category sensitive to Higgs boson pro-",

The single-muon trigger has a transverse momentum (p T ) threshold of 26 GeV and applies a requirement on the muon track isolation. The track isolation is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the ID tracks in a cone of \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.3 around the muon. For the trigger used during 2016, the cone size was modified to be \u2206R = 10/(p T /GeV) for muons with p T > 33.3 GeV. The track isolation is computed from ID tracks with p T > 1 GeV and with a longitudinal impact parameter z 0 within 6 mm of the z 0 of the muon track, excluding the muon track itself. The track isolation is required to be less than 6% (7%) of the muon's transverse momentum in the 2015 (2016) data set. A second single-muon trigger with a p T threshold of 50 GeV has no requirement on the track isolation. The dimuon trigger has p T thresholds of 22 GeV and 8 GeV and does not apply track isolation criteria. Single-electron triggers with p T thresholds at 24 GeV (26 GeV), 60 GeV, and 120 GeV (140 GeV) are used, as well as a dielectron trigger with a p T threshold of 12 GeV (17 GeV) during the 2015 (2016) data taking. In the 2016 data-taking period, the lowest-threshold single-electron trigger required the track isolation in a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 for p T < 50 GeV and \u2206R = 10/(p T /GeV) for p T > 50 GeV to be less than 10% of the electron's transverse energy. For all electron triggers, electron candidates must satisfy identification criteria based on the properties of the energy cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter and its associated track. The singleelectron triggers with lower thresholds use tighter criteria for the electron identification. For H \u2192 Z\u03b3 events that pass the analysis preselection (see section 4), the efficiency to pass the trigger selection is 92.9% (96.9%) for Z boson decays to muon (electron) pairs. For a high-mass resonance at 1 TeV, the corresponding efficiencies are 94.3% and 99.8% for muon and electron final states, respectively.",

Z+\u03b3 production within the SM is primarily due to radiation of photons from final-state leptons (FSR) or initial-state quarks (ISR). Both SM processes were simulated using the Sherpa generator [68] (version 2.1.1 for Z+\u03b3 and version 2.2.0 for Z+jets), and the matrix elements were calculated using the Comix [69] and OpenLoops [70] generators, where Z+\u03b3 production was calculated for real emission of up to two partons at leading order (LO) in QCD and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [71] using the ME+PS@LO prescription [72]. The process of Z+jets was calculated for up to two partons at next-to-leading-order (NLO) and four partons at LO and merged with the parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [73]. For the Z+\u03b3 (Z+jets) samples, the CT10 (NNPDF3.0) PDF set was used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. To study the background model in detail, a large sample of Z+\u03b3 events was simulated using fast simulation of the calorimeter response [74].",

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [81] with a radius parameter of 0.4 with three-dimensional topological clusters [82] as input.

Leptons are required to be consistent with the objects that triggered the event. Trigger efficiency turn-on effects are mitigated by transverse momentum requirements on the leptons that fired the single-lepton or dilepton trigger. If the event was triggered by a single-lepton trigger, the transverse momentum is required to be at least 27 GeV for the leading lepton, and at least 1 GeV higher than the respective trigger threshold in cases where the event was triggered by one of the higher-threshold triggers. If the event was triggered by a dilepton trigger, the transverse momentum is required to be at least 24 GeV (18 GeV) for the leading muon (electron) and 10 GeV (18 GeV) for the subleading muon (electron). For Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 candidates with an invariant mass between 66 and 89 GeV, the invariant mass resolution of the Z boson candidate is improved by correcting the muon momenta for collinear FSR by including any reconstructed electromagnetic cluster with p T above 1.5 GeV lying close to a muon track (with \u2206R < 0.15) if the corrected invariant mass is below 100 GeV [86]. A constrained kinematic fit is applied to recompute the four-momenta of the dilepton pair [87] for Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and Z \u2192 ee candidates. The fit models the lepton energy and momentum response as a Gaussian distribution for each lepton, and the Gaussian width is given by the expected resolution. The Z lineshape is used as a constraint with the approximation of the leptons being massless. The lineshape is modelled by a Breit-Wigner distribution. After the application of the FSR corrections and the kinematic fit, Z boson candidates are required to have an invariant mass within 15 GeV of the Z boson mass, m Z = 91.2 GeV [11]. If multiple Z boson candidates pass all requirements, the candidate with the mass closest to the Z boson mass is chosen. About 0.2% (0.5%) of events that pass the final H \u2192 Z\u03b3 (X \u2192 Z\u03b3) selection have more than one Z boson candidate within the 15 GeV mass window.",

A combined requirement on the isolation energy in the calorimeter and the inner detector is used. The calorimeter isolation is computed as the sum of transverse energies of positive-energy topological clusters [82] in the calorimeter within a cone of \u2206R = 0.2 centred around the photon shower barycentre. The transverse energy of the photon candidate is removed and the contributions of the underlying event and pile-up are -  subtracted based on the method suggested in ref. [88]. The track isolation for a cone size of \u2206R = 0.2 is used and for converted photons the tracks associated with the conversion are removed. The calorimeter (track) isolation is required to be less than 6.5% (5%) of the photon p T . The efficiency of the isolation requirement for photons satisfying the tight identification criteria ranges from approximately 60% for p T of 15 GeV to more than 90% for p T of 40 GeV and larger. For the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 (X \u2192 Z\u03b3) search, the photon transverse momentum requirement is tightened to 15 GeV (p T /m Z\u03b3 > 0.3).",

For spin-2 resonances produced in gluongluon (quark-antiquark) initial states, the efficiencies range from about 22% (28%) to about 35% (54%) in the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV. The efficiency differences between the spin-0 resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion, the spin-2 resonance produced via gluon-gluon initial states and the spin-2 resonance produced via quark-antiquark initial states are primarily related to the different photon transverse momentum distributions between the different production mechanisms.",

In the control region, photon candidates are required to fail the tight identification, but to pass a modified loose identification. It differs from the tight identification by removing the requirements on four out of nine shower shape variables which are the least correlated with the calorimeter isolation [93]. The calorimeter isolation distribution for photons and the contribution of true photons to the control region are determined from simulation, while the calorimeter isolation distribution for jets is determined in the fit and assumed to be the same in the signal and control regions. This assumption is supported by extensive studies performed in the context of earlier analyses [93]. The composition is determined in the inclusive selection for the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 search and the fraction of Z+\u03b3 events is found to be 0.838 \u00b1 0.005 (stat.) \u00b1 0.031 (syst.). For the high-mass resonance search, the fraction of Z+\u03b3 events is found to be 0.916\u00b10.009 (stat.) +0.013 \u22120.019 (syst.). The systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the set of shower shape variables that are removed from the tight identification to define the modified loose identification [93]. The results of the composition estimate are cross-checked with a two-dimensional sideband technique [93] based on the calorimeter isolation of the photon candidate and whether or not the photon candidate satisfies the tight identification criteria (when the photon fails the tight identification it is still required to pass the modified loose identification), which gives consistent results.",

For each category used in either analysis, the bias (also referred to as spurious signal) is estimated as a function of the signal invariant mass by performing a signal+background fit to a m Z\u03b3 background-only distribution with small statistical fluctuations. The background-only distribution is constructed from the fast simulation of Z+\u03b3 events, and the contribution from Z+jets events is included by reweighting the Z+\u03b3 simulated distribution as follows: for each category, the shape of the Z+jets contribution is determined in a data control region defined by requiring that the photon candidate fails to satisfy the identification and isolation criteria. To smooth statistical fluctuations in the Z+jets shape, a firstorder polynomial is fitted to the ratio of the Z+jets and Z+\u03b3 shapes, and the smoothed Z+jets shape is constructed from the fit result and the Z+\u03b3 shape. The reweighting of the Z+\u03b3 distribution to take into account the Z+jets contribution is determined from the smoothed Z+jets shape. The normalisation of the Z+jets contribution is determined from the number of events obtained when applying the selection and categorisation to the Z+\u03b3 and Z+jets simulation samples and the purity of the inclusive sample, measured as JHEP10(2017)112 described above. The spurious signal is required to be less than 40% (20%) of the expected statistical uncertainty in the signal yield, which is dominated by the expected statistical uncertainty of the background, in the search for Higgs boson (high-mass resonance) decays to Z\u03b3. The looser requirement for the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 search is chosen to improve the robustness of the procedure against statistical fluctuations in the simulated Z+\u03b3 event sample. If two or more considered functions satisfy this requirement, the function with the fewest number of parameters is chosen.",

The uncertainty in the modelling of the production of jets in gluon-gluon fusion production due to the perturbative order in QCD is estimated by scale variations in MCFM [101]. It accounts for the uncertainty in the overall normalisation of H + 2-jets events as well as the uncertainty due to the use of \u2206\u03c6 Z\u03b3,jj , which serves to apply an implicit third-jet veto, in the VBF BDT. The estimation of this uncertainty uses an extension of the Stewart-Tackmann method [102,103]. It corresponds to 45% of the ggF contribution to the VBF category. Additional uncertainties are assigned to account for potential mismodelling of the variables that serve as input to the VBF BDT (see section 4). They are estimated by reweighting the simulated ggF events to match the distributions in m jj , \u2206\u03b7 jj , p Tt , \u2206R min Z/\u03b3,j , and |\u03b7 Z\u03b3 \u2212(\u03b7 j1 +\u03b7 j2 )/2| obtained from MadGraph5 aMC@NLO. The resulting uncertainty in the ggF contribution to the VBF category is 15%. Uncertainties in the modelling of the Higgs boson p T spectrum are taken to be the envelope of the variations of the renormalisation, factorisation, and resummation scales obtained using HRes 2.3 [104] to simulate the p T spectrum. The resulting uncertainties are evaluated using the Stewart-Tackmann method [102,103] for the high relative p T and the p Tt categorisation and found to range from 8.4% to 22%. Uncertainties from the choice of PDF set and \u03b1 s are evaluated using the combined error PDF set, which takes into account 30 variations of NNLO PDFs and two variations of \u03b1 s , following the PDF4LHC recommendations [33] and are found to range from 0.2% to 2.0%. The uncertainty in the acceptance due to the modelling of multiple-parton interactions is estimated from the difference in acceptance with and without multiple-particle interactions for the gluon-gluon fusion simulation sample and ranges from 2.9% to 25%.",

            "text": "The results are derived using closed-form asymptotic formulae [105] for masses up to 1.6 TeV. Due to the small number of events at large m Z\u03b3 in the high-mass resonance search, the results for m X > 1.6 TeV are derived using ensemble tests. The expected cross-section limits obtained from the asymptotic formulae agree to better than 10% with those obtained from the ensemble tests up to m X of 1.7 TeV. At high m X , the observed (expected) central values are underestimated by 35% (23%) in the asymptotic approach. The invariant mass distributions of events satisfying the high-mass selection are displayed for both categories (ee and \u00b5\u00b5) in figure 6 and compared to the background-only fit performed in the fit range 200 < m Z\u03b3 < 2500 GeV. The highest masses measured in the ee\u03b3 and \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 final states are 1.47 TeV and 1.57 TeV, respectively. In the fit range, no significant excess is observed with respect to the background-only hypothesis. The largest deviation is observed around m X = 960 GeV corresponding to a local significance of 2.7 \u03c3. The global significance, evaluated using the search region of [250-2400] GeV in mass, is found to be 0.8 \u03c3. The observed and expected upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X)\u2022B(X \u2192 Z\u03b3) as a function of m X are shown in figure 7. The observed limits vary between 88 fb and 2.8 fb for the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV at the 95% CL for a spin-0 resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion, while the expected limits range from 61 fb to 2.7 fb in the same mass range. For a spin-0 resonance produced via vector-boson fusion, the limits are up to 4% lower due to the slightly larger efficiency for this production process.",

The observed data are consistent with the expected background. No evidence for the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 and X \u2192 Z\u03b3 decays is observed and upper limits are set on \u03c3(pp \u2192 H) \u2022 B(H \u2192 Z\u03b3) at m H = 125.09 GeV and also on \u03c3(pp \u2192 X) \u2022 B(X \u2192 Z\u03b3) as a function of m X . For the Higgs mass of 125.09 GeV, the observed 95% CL upper limit on the \u03c3(pp \u2192 H) \u2022 B(H \u2192 Z\u03b3) is 6.6 times the SM prediction. The search for high-mass Z\u03b3 resonances was studied using both the spin-0 and spin-2 interpretations. The observed limit varies between 88 fb and 2.8 fb for the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV for a spin-0 resonance, where a resonance produced in gluon-gluon fusion is used as a benchmark model. For spin-2 resonances, LO predictions from the Higgs Characterisation Model are used as benchmarks. The limits for spin-2 resonances range between 117 fb (94 fb) and 3.7 fb (2.3 fb) for the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV for a resonance produced via gluon-gluon (quark-antiquark) initial states. The corresponding expected limits for this mass range vary between 61 fb and 2.7 fb for a spin-0 resonance, and between 82 fb (66 fb) and 3.6 fb (2.2 fb) for a spin-2 resonance produced via gluon-gluon (quark-antiquark) initial states.",

The p-value corresponds to a local significance of 1.0 \u03c3. The expected p-value for a SM Higgs boson at m H = 125.09 GeV is 0.33, corresponding to a significance of 0.5 \u03c3. The observed 95% CL limit on \u03c3(pp \u2192 H) \u2022 B(H \u2192 Z\u03b3) is found to be 6.6 times the SM prediction, corresponding to the limit of 547 fb. Assuming SM Higgs boson production, the upper limit on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decay to Z\u03b3 is found to be 1.0%. The expected 95% CL limit on \u03c3(pp \u2192 H) \u2022 B(H \u2192 Z\u03b3) assuming no (a SM) Higgs boson decay to Z\u03b3 is 4.4 (5.2) times the SM prediction.",
