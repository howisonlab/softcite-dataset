The search also utilises b-tagged jets, missing transverse momentum and other observables to extend its sensitivity. The analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed. The results are interpreted in several simplified supersymmetric models and extend the exclusion limits from previous searches. In the context of exclusive production and simplified decay modes, gluino masses are excluded at 95 % confidence level up to 1.1-1.3 TeV for light neutralinos (depending on the decay channel), and bottom squark masses are also excluded up to 540 GeV. In the former scenarios, neutralino masses are also excluded up to 550-850 GeV for gluino masses around 1 TeV.",

The latter also favours significantt L -t R mixing, so that the lighter mass eigenstatet 1 is in many scenarios lighter than the other squarks [19,20]. Bottom squarks may also be light, being bound to top squarks by SU (2) L invariance. This leads to potentially large production cross-sections for gluino pairs (gg), top-antitop squark pairs (t 1t * 1 ) and bottom-antibottom squark pairs (b 1b * 1 ) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [21].

It is an extension to \u221a s = 13 TeV of an earlier search performed by ATLAS with \u221a s = 8 TeV data [23], and uses the data collected by the ATLAS experiment [24] in protonproton ( pp) collisions during 2015. Despite the much lower integrated luminosity collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV compared to that collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV, a similar or improved sensitivity at \u221a s = 13 TeV is expected due to the much larger crosssections predicted for the production of SUSY particles with masses at the TeV scale. A similar search for SUSY in this topology was also performed by the CMS Collaboration [25] at \u221a s = 8 TeV. While the same-sign leptons signature is present in many scenarios of physics beyond the SM (BSM), SM processes leading to such final states have very small cross-sections. Compared to many other BSM searches, analyses based on same-sign leptons therefore allow the use of looser kinematic requirements (for example, on E miss T or the momentum of jets and leptons), preserving sensitivity to scenarios with small mass differences between gluinos/squarks and the LSP, or in which R-parity is not conserved [23].",

The first two scenarios focus on gluino pair production with generic decays into light quarks and multiple leptons, either involving light sleptons, g \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 2 \u2192 qq \u02dc * \u2192 qq + \u2212\u03c7 0 1 (Fig. 1a), or mediated by a cascade involving\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 2 ,g \u2192 qq \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 qq W \u00b1\u03c7 0 2 \u2192 qq W \u00b1 Z\u03c7 0 1 (Fig. 1b). The other two scenarios are motivated by the expectation that the third-generation squarks are lighter than the other squarks and target the direct production ofb 1b * 1 pairs with subsequent chargino-mediated b 1 \u2192 t W \u2212\u03c7 0 1 decays (Fig. 1c) or the production ofgg pairs decaying asg \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 via an off-shell top squark ( Fig. 1d). Four signal regions (SRs) are designed to achieve good sensitivity for these SUSY scenarios, mainly characterised by the number of b-tagged jets or reconstructed leptons. They are detailed in Sect. 4, preceded by descriptions of the experimental apparatus (Sect. 2) and the simulated samples (Sect. 3). Section 5 is devoted to the estimation of the contribution from SM processes to the signal regions, validated by comparisons with data in dedicated regions. The results are presented in Sect. 6, together with the statistical tests used to interpret the results in the context of the SUSY benchmark scenarios. Finally, Sect. 7 summarises the main conclusions of this paper.",

The MC samples are processed through an ATLAS detector simulation [28] based on Geant4 [29] or a fast simulation using a parameterisation of the calorimeter response and Geant4 for the other parts of the detector [30] and are reconstructed in the same manner as the data. Diboson processes with four charged leptons ( ), three charged leptons and one neutrino, or two charged leptons and two neutrinos are simulated using the Sherpa v2.1.1 generator [31], and are described in detail in Ref. [32]. The matrix elements contain the doubly resonant W W , W Z and Z Z processes and all other diagrams with four or six electroweak vertices (such as same-electric-charge W boson production in association with two jets, W \u00b1 W \u00b1 j j). Fully leptonic triboson processes (W W W , W W Z, W Z Z and Z Z Z) with up to six charged leptons are also simulated using Sherpa v2.1.1 and described in Ref. [32]. The 4 and 2 +2\u03bd processes are calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) for up to one additional parton; final states with two and three additional partons are calculated at leading order (LO). The W W Z \u2192 4 + 2\u03bd or 2 + 4\u03bd processes are calculated at LO with up to two additional partons. The 3 + 1\u03bd process is calculated at NLO and up to three extra partons at LO using the Comix [33] and OpenLoops [34] matrix element generators and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [35] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [36]. The W W W/W Z Z \u2192 3 + 3\u03bd, W Z Z \u2192 5 + 1\u03bd, Z Z Z \u2192 6 + 0\u03bd, 4 + 2\u03bd or 2 + 4\u03bd processes are calculated with the same configuration but with up to only two extra partons at LO. The CT10 [37] parton distribution function (PDF) set is used for all Sherpa samples in conjunction with a dedicated tuning of the parton shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. The generator cross-sections (at NLO for most of the processes) are used when normalising these backgrounds.",

Parton luminosities are provided by the NNPDF23LO PDF set. Jet-parton matching is realised following the CKKW-L prescription [47], with a matching scale set to one quarter of the pair-produced superpartner mass. Signal cross-sections are calculated to NLO in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [48][49][50][51][52]. The nominal cross-section and the uncertainty are taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorisation and renormalisation scales, as described in Ref. [53]. The production cross-section of gluino pairs with a mass of 1. . In all MC samples, except those produced by Sherpa, the EvtGen v1.2.0 program [54] is used to model the properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. To simulate the effects of additional pp collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings, additional interactions are generated using the soft QCD processes of Pythia 8.186 with the A2 tune [55] and the MSTW2008LO PDF [56], and overlaid onto the simulated hard scatter event. The Monte Carlo samples are reweighted so that the distribution of the number of reconstructed vertices matches the distribution observed in the data.",

In this method, two types of lepton identification criteria are defined: \"tight\", corresponding to the signal lepton criteria described in Sect. 4, and \"loose\", corresponding to candidate leptons. The matrix method relates the number of events containing prompt or FNP leptons to the number of observed events with tight or loose-not-tight leptons using the probability for loose prompt or FNP leptons to satisfy the tight criteria. The probability for loose prompt leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria is obtained using a Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 data sample and is modelled as a function of the lepton p T and \u03b7. The probability for loose FNP leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria is determined from data in a SS control region enriched in non-prompt leptons originating from heavy-flavour decays.

The normalisation is performed using five multipliers: one to correct Table 2 The main sources of systematic uncertainty on the SM background estimates for the four signal regions are shown and their values given as relative uncertainties in the expected signal region background event yields. The individual components can be correlated and therefore do not necessarily add up in quadrature to the total systematic uncertainty. For reference, the total number of expected background events is also shown the electron charge mis-identification rate, and four to correct the contributions from FNP electrons or muons originating from b-jets or light-flavour jets, respectively. In addition to the MC samples listed in Sect. 3, this method employs samples of top quark pair production generated with the Powheg-Box v2 generator interfaced to Pythia 6.428 [69], as well as samples of simulated W +jets and Z +jets events generated with Powheg-Box v2 interfaced to Pythia 8.186. Table 2 summarises the contributions of the different sources of systematic uncertainty in the total SM background predictions in the signal regions. The systematic uncertainties related to the same-sign prompt leptons background estimation arise from the accuracy of the theoretical and experimental modelling in the MC simulation. The primary sources of systematic uncertainties are related to the jet energy scale calibration, the jet energy resolution, b-tagging efficiency, and MC modelling and theoretical cross-section uncertainties. The cross-sections used to normalise the MC samples are varied according to the uncertainty in the cross-section calculation, that is, 6 % for diboson, 13 % for tt W and 12 % tt Z production [43]. Additional uncertainties are assigned to these backgrounds to account for the modelling of the kinematic distributions in the MC simulation. For tt W and tt Z, the predictions from the Mad-Graph and Sherpa generators are compared, leading to a \u223c30 % uncertainty for these processes after the SR selections. For dibosons, uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalisation, factorisation and resummation scales used to generate these samples, leading to a \u223c30 % uncertainty for these processes after the SR selections. For tribo-son, tth, tttt and t Z production processes, which constitute a small background in all signal regions, a 50 % uncertainty on the event yields is assumed.",
