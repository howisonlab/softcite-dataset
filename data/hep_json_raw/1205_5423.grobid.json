            "text": "The measurement of heavy-flavor (charm and beauty) production serves as an important testing ground of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. Because of the large quark masses, heavyflavor production in proton-proton (pp) collisions proceeds mainly through initial hard parton-parton collisions. Therefore, the production cross sections of charm and beauty quarks should provide a precision test of perturbative QCD (pQCD) for all values of transverse momenta p t . In previous experiments with p\" p collisions at the Tevatron ( ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV), charm production cross sections were measured at high p t only and were found to exceed, by about 50% [1], the cross sections expected from pQCD calculations [2][3][4]. This, however, is still compatible with the substantial theoretical uncertainties. Beauty production at the Tevatron is well described by such calculations [5].",

In such collisions a strongly interacting partonic medium is formed [6][7][8][9]. Heavy quarks interact with this medium after they have been produced in the initial stage of the collision. Consequently, heavy quarks suffer energy loss while they propagate through the medium, and they participate in the collective dynamics. The resulting modifications of the heavy-flavor momentum distributions in heavy-ion collisions with respect to those in pp collisions present a sensitive probe for the medium properties [10].",

In Au-Au collisions, the total yield of electrons from heavyflavor decays was observed to scale with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions [22].

Perturbative QCD calculations agree well with lepton production cross sections from heavy-flavor hadron decays measured for p t > 4 GeV=c with the ATLAS experiment at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV [25]. Furthermore, pQCD calculations of beauty hadron decays are in good agreement with production cross sections of nonprompt J=c at midrapidity as measured with the CMS experiment at high p t (p t > 6:5 GeV=c) [26] and with ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at lower p t (p t > 1:3 GeV=c) [27]. D-meson production cross sections measured with ALICE are reproduced by corresponding calculations within substantial uncertainties at 7 [28] and at 2.76 TeV [29]. In addition, pQCD calculations are in agreement with the spectra of muons from heavy-flavor hadron decays at moderate p t as measured with ALICE at 7 [30] and at 2.76 TeV [31]. It is of particular importance to investigate charm production at low p t [28] in order to measure the total charm production cross section with good precision. Furthermore, low-p t charm measurements at the LHC probe the parton distribution function of the proton in the region of parton fractional momenta x $ 10 \u00c04 and squared momentum transfers Q 2 $ \u00f04 GeV\u00de 2 , where gluon saturation effects might play a role [32].",

For such a measurement an excellent electron identification (eID) and precise knowledge of the remaining hadron background in the electron candidate sample are mandatory. Two complementary eID approaches are employed. Both are based on the particle specific energy loss dE=dx in the ALICE Time Projection Chamber, required to be compatible with the energy loss of electrons. To increase the purity of the electron candidate sample, in the first approach a combination of time-of-flight measurements and the response of the transition radiation detector is employed (TPC-TOF/TPC-TRD-TOF analysis). In the second approach, electromagnetic calorimetry is used (TPC-EMCal analysis).",

The standard ALICE coordinate system is used, in which the interaction point (IP) where the particles collide is at the origin of a righthanded Cartesian coordinate system. From the IP the z axis is along the beam pipe, the x axis points towards the center of the LHC, is the azimuthal angle around the z axis, and is the polar angle with respect to this axis. The setup includes a muon spectrometer at backward pseudorapidity (\u00c0 4 < < \u00c02:5) and a central barrel comprising several detector subsystems located inside a large solenoidal magnet. The magnet provides a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T along the beam direction. Most of the barrel detectors have a common pseudorapidity coverage of \u00c00:9 < < 0:9. The apparatus is described in detail elsewhere [34]. In the following, the detectors used in the analysis are discussed briefly. For guidance, Fig. 1 shows a schematic beam view at z \u00bc 0 of the ALICE central barrel detectors during the 2010 running period of the LHC.",

The ITS provides high-resolution space points for charged particle tracks close to the interaction point, thus improving the momentum and angular resolution. The ITS includes six cylindrical layers employing three different silicon detector technologies. The two innermost layers (at radii of 3.9 and 7.6 cm), which are equipped with Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD), provide a spatial resolution of 12 m in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction (r) and 100 m along the beam axis (z). About 83% of the SPD channels were operational for charged particle detection during the data-taking relevant for this analysis. The SPD also contributes to the collision trigger providing a fast estimation of the event multiplicity. The two intermediate layers of the ITS are built with Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) and the two outermost layers consist of double-sided Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD). Their radii extend from 15 to 43 cm. The ITS modules were aligned using survey information, cosmic-ray tracks, and pp data with the methods described in Ref. [35]. The material budget of the entire ITS corresponds on average to about 7.18% of X 0 at \u00bc 0 [34]. The exact knowledge of the material budget in the innermost ITS layers is crucial here as the conversion of photons into electron-positron pairs in material is the source of an important background component in the present analysis. In the ALICE experiment, the reconstruction of such conversion pairs has resulted in a measurement of the relevant material budget with a precision of 4.5% [36].",

The ALICE TPC is a large cylindrical drift detector, whose active volume extends radially from 85 to 247 cm, and from \u00c0250 to \u00fe250 cm along the beam direction. The active volume of nearly 90 m 3 is filled with a Ne (85.5%), CO 2 (9.5%), and N 2 (4.8%) gas mixture. A central highvoltage electrode maintained at \u00c0100 kV divides the TPC into two sections. The end caps are equipped with multiwire proportional chambers with cathode pad readout. For a particle traversing the TPC, up to 159 space points (clusters) are recorded. The cluster data are used to reconstruct the charged particle trajectory in the magnetic field as well as to calculate the particle's specific energy loss dE=dx in the TPC gas. Simultaneous measurements of the dE=dx and momentum allow the identification of the particle species which has produced the track. The dE=dx resolution of the TPC, TPC-dE=dx , was approximately 5.5% for minimum ionizing particles crossing the full detector [38]. The dE=dx resolution was determined using minimum ionizing pions and cosmic ray muons at the Fermi plateau. Charged particle tracks are reconstructed in the ITS and TPC with a transverse momentum resolution ranging from about 1% at 1 GeV=c to about 3% at 10 GeV=c [37].",

Each supermodule is segmented further in five units (stacks) along the beam direction. Each stack comprises six layers in the radial direction. Each detector element consists of a fiber sandwich radiator of 48-mm thickness [39], a drift section of 30-mm thickness, and a multiwire proportional chamber section (7-mm thickness) with pad readout. The gas is a mixture of Xe (85%) and CO 2 (15%) [40][41][42][43]. The scope of the TRD is to provide a good separation of electrons from pions, particularly for momenta above 1 GeV=c.

The TOF detector is segmented into 18 sectors and covers the full azimuth. Each sector contains 91 Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs). In total, 152,928 sensitive pads of dimension 2:5 \u00c2 3:5 cm 2 are read out. The TOF resolution of the particle arrival time is, at present, better than 100 ps [46]. The start time of the collision is measured by the ALICE T0 detector, an array of Cherenkov counters located at \u00fe350 and \u00c070 cm along the beam line, or it is estimated using the particle arrival times at the TOF detector in events without a T0 signal. In the case that neither of the two methods provides an output, an average start time is used. Depending on the start time method used, the corresponding resolution is taken into account in the overall TOF PID resolution. The particle identification is based on the difference between the measured time of flight and its expected value, computed for each mass hypothesis from the track momentum and length of the trajectory. The overall resolution of this difference TOF-PID is about 160 ps [28]. The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) is a Pb-scintillator sampling calorimeter, located at a radial distance of about 4.5 m from the beam line. The full detector covers the pseudorapidity range \u00c00:7 < < 0:7 with an azimuthal acceptance of \u00c1 \u00bc 107 . In the 2010 running period of ALICE, the azimuthal coverage of the EMCal was limited to \u00c1 \u00bc 40 , since only part of the detector was installed. The calorimeter is of the ''Shashlik''-type built from alternating lead and scintillator segments of 1.44-and 1.76-mm thickness, respectively, together with longitudinal wavelength-shifting fibers for light collection. The cell size of the EMCal is approximately 0:014 \u00c2 0:014 rad in \u00c1 \u00c2 \u00c1, and the depth corresponds to 20.1 X 0 .

First, charged particle tracks which fulfil a set of electron identification cuts were selected.

After corrections for geometrical acceptance and efficiency, the inclusive electron yield per minimum bias triggered collision was determined for two different electron identification strategies. Since for all relevant sources the spectra of decay positrons and electrons are identical (e \u00fe =e \u00c0 \u00bc 1), the average spectrum of positrons and electrons, \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2, was used for the further analysis. The electron background from sources other than semileptonic heavy-flavor hadron decays was calculated using a cocktail approach and subtracted from the inclusive electron spectra. The resulting spectra of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays were normalized using the cross section of minimum bias triggered pp collisions. A weighted average of the two measurements obtained with different electron identification strategies led to the final result.",

A cut on the 2 per degree of freedom (ndf) of the momentum fit in the TPC was applied to reject fake tracks which comprise a significant number of clusters originating from more than one charged particle trajectory. A track reconstructed within the TPC is characterized by the number of clusters used for the track reconstruction and fit (up to a maximum of 159 clusters). Not all of these clusters are used for the energy-loss calculation: those close to the borders of the TPC sectors are not considered. Separate cuts are applied on these two quantities. To guarantee good particle identification based on the specific dE=dx in the TPC, tracks were required to include a minimum number of 80 clusters used for the energy loss calculation. A cut on the number of clusters for tracking is used to enhance the electron/pion separation. As the energy deposit of electrons on the Fermi plateau is approximately 1.6 times larger than for minimum ionizing particles, the associated clusters are insensitive to detector threshold effects and electron tracks have, on average, a higher number of clusters. The stringent request for at least 120 clusters from the maximum of 159 enhances electrons relative to hadrons. Kink candidates, i.e., tracks which are not consistent with the track model of continuous particle trajectories but show deviations due to decays in flight or the emission of Bremsstrahlung, were discarded from further analysis since the dE=dx resolution of the TPC is worse for such kink tracks than for regular tracks. In order to minimize the contribution from photon conversions in the ITS, a hit in the innermost SPD layer was required for all selected tracks in the TPC-TOF/TPC-TRD-TOF analysis. In total, at least four ITS hits were required to be associated with a track. Since the active area in azimuth of the EMCal overlapped with an inactive area of the first SPD layer, this approach had to be modified for the TPC-EMCal analysis. For the latter case, a matching hit was required in any of the two SPD layers and the required total number of ITS hits was reduced to three. Charged pion tracks from the weak decay K 0 S ! \u00fe \u00c0 occurring beyond the first SPD layer were used to demonstrate that the probability of random matches between tracks and uncorrelated hits in the ITS is negligible. A cut on the distance of closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex in the transverse plane (xy) as well as in the beam direction (z) was applied to reject background tracks and nonprimary tracks.",

The detector which played the most important role in particle identification for both analyses discussed here is the TPC. Particle identification in the TPC is based on the measurement of the specific energy loss dE=dx in the detector gas. The dE=dx distribution, expressed in arbitrary units, as a function of the particle momentum for tracks measured in 7 TeV pp collisions, is shown in the left panel of Fig. 2. The solid lines depict the energy loss for electrons, pions, kaons, protons, and deuterons expected from the Bethe-Bloch formula [49]. For the electron selection, the energy loss was expressed as a deviation from the parametrized electron Bethe-Bloch line, divided by the energy-loss resolution TPC-dE=dx , as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. Figure 2 demonstrates that the electron identification provided by the TPC is not sufficient at low momentum (below 1:5 GeV=c) because the kaon and proton dE=dx lines cross the electron line. In addition, the merging of the dE=dx lines of electrons, muons, pions, and other hadrons limits the particle identification at high momentum. Therefore, a high purity electron candidate sample can only be selected with the help of other detectors. Two different strategies were used in this analysis, one employing in addition the information from the TOF and TRD detectors, and the other one based on the EMCal response.",

The time-of-flight information allows the rejection of kaons up to a momentum of approximately 1:5 GeV=c and protons up to about 3 GeV=c. The selection was done by comparing the measured time of flight with the value expected assuming the particle being an electron. Only tracks compatible with the electron hypothesis within momentum, is shown in the upper left panel of Fig. 3. Lines indicate the selection band. This criterion combined with the selection of tracks between 0 and 3 TPC-dE=dx resulted in a pure sample of electron candidates up to a momentum of approximately 4 GeV=c. In this momentum range, the hadron contamination remained below 1%, while above 4 GeV=c the pion contamination became significant again. At such high momenta the TOF information could not be used to reduce further the hadron contamination in the electron candidate sample. Therefore, the TPC-TOF analysis was restricted to the p t range below 4 GeV=c. To extend the accessible range to higher momenta, information from the TRD was used. As for the TPC, particle identification in the TRD makes use of the specific energy loss in the detector gas. In addition, the measurement of transition radiation photons produced by electrons traversing the dedicated radiators in front of the TRD drift chambers enhances distinctively the capability of the TRD to separate electrons from hadrons. The charge deposit per tracklet was compared with reference charge distributions obtained from dedicated test beam data [50], where electron and pion beams were provided at a number of different, discrete momenta. The probability of identifying a particle of given momentum as an electron was derived from a linear interpolation between the nearest measured data points in momentum.

The residual contamination to the electron sample is given by the contribution of misidentified charged particles after the cut on the TPC dE=dx. The cut on the TPC dE=dx applied for electrons was chosen to have 50% efficiency for all momenta. The electron line was parametrized using a Gaussian function, which describes well the shape of the TPC dE=dx distribution, expressed as deviation from the parametrized electron Bethe-Bloch line normalized by the energy loss resolution, for a given particle species close to the maximum of this distribution. The dominant contribution to the contamination of the electron candidate sample at momenta above 1 GeV=c comes from the tail of the pion dE=dx distribution. This tail is not adequately described  by a Gaussian for the purpose of an estimation of the contamination. A better description of the tail of the pion dE=dx distribution is obtained by multiplying a Landau distribution with an exponential term. The validity of this approach was confirmed using a clean pion sample from K 0 S decays which was selected using the V0-finder and tagged using topological cuts [51]. At low momenta, protons and kaons are suppressed by the eID cut applied using the TOF detector, while at higher momenta the kaon and proton dE=dx lines approach each other. Therefore, a single slightly skewed Gaussian distribution was used to fit the combined contribution of both particle types. The contribution of muons was fitted jointly with that of the pions.",

These effects distort the shape of the p t distribution, which falls steeply with increasing momentum, and have to be taken into account. The necessary correction grows with increasing steepness of the p t distribution and with increasing widths of the p t bins. To determine this correction, an unfolding procedure based on Bayes's theorem was applied. The Monte Carlo generated and reconstructed transverse momentum distributions of electrons were used to obtain a smearing matrix. A detailed description of the procedure can be found elsewhere [55].

Second, photons from the decay 0 ! (BR \u00bc 98:823 AE 0:034% [11]) can convert in material into e \u00fe e \u00c0 pairs in the ALICE acceptance. This process gives rise to a secondary source of electrons not originating from the collision vertex. It is important to point out that, although the total material budget in the ALICE central barrel acceptance is relatively large (11:4 AE 0:5% of a radiation length X 0 integrated over a radial distance up to 180 cm from the beam line in the range jj < 0:9) [36], the material budget relevant for the present analysis is much less (see below). In fact, electron candidate tracks considered here are required to be associated with either a hit in the first pixel layer of the ALICE ITS in case of the TPC-TOF/ TPC-TRD-TOF analysis or a hit in any of the two pixel layers in the TPC-EMCal analysis. Therefore, only conversions in the beam pipe and in a fraction of the ITS material are relevant here.

As it is done conventionally, in the first approach the two decay photons are measured via electromagnetic calorimetry.

In this region, it becomes advantageous to reconstruct photons in a second approach via the conversion into e \u00fe e \u00c0 pairs in the detector acceptance.

An analysis of the reconstruction of photon conversions in ALICE demonstrated that the material budget implemented in the Monte Carlo simulation is in agreement within an uncertainty of 4.5% with the actual material budget of the experiment [36]. Since, for the present analysis, electron candidate tracks were required to be associated with a hit in the SPD, only the beam pipe, air, and a fraction of the ITS material contributed to the effective converter thickness. The beam pipe is made out of beryllium with a polyimide wrapping and its thickness in terms of radiation lengths is X=X 0 \u00bc 0:26%. The corresponding thickness of a pixel layer is X=X 0 \u00bc 1:14% for the full layer, including the sensor, the readout chip, and the infrastructure [34]. The construction of the first pixel layer is such that the active sensor layer is closer to the beam line than the readout and most of the infrastructure, i.e., conversions in the latter do not give rise to a recorded hit in this detector. In the second pixel layer, the order is reversed, i.e., the readout and most of the infrastructure are closer to the beam line than the sensor itself. Therefore, for the TPC-EMCal analysis, the thickness of most of both pixel layers had to be considered in the calculation of the as function of p t [56] together with fits using Eq. (2) (left panel). Ratios of the measured 0 and spectra to the fits (right panel).

For the TPC-TOF/ TPC-TRD-TOF analysis, only a fraction of the first pixel layer was relevant in addition to the beam pipe and air. For the latter case, from the known material budget and from full Monte Carlo simulations of photon conversions in the pixel detector, the effective thickness of the first pixel layer was determined to be \u00f045 AE 5\u00de% of its total thickness.

For the decays of other light mesons the ratio is slightly smaller than for neutral pions due to the fact that BR Dalitz =BR increases with increasing parent meson mass. In addition, it was taken into account that the photon conversion probability is not constant but depends slightly on the photon energy, introducing a p t dependence of the ratio Conversion/Dalitz, which was determined in a full Monte Carlo simulation. The corresponding correction was applied in the calculation of the conversion contribution to the background electron cocktail. However, this correction is significant only for low momentum electrons (0:5 < p t < 1 GeV=c), where the ratio Conversion/Dalitz is reduced by 10% or less, relative to its asymptotic value given in Eq. 3.",

It turned out that the contribution from K e3 decays to the inclusive electron spectrum was essentially negligible. This was due to the fact that electron candidates considered in the present analysis were required to be associated with a hit in the first pixel layer of the ALICE ITS. Since this detector layer is close to the primary collision vertex (3.9 cm radial distance from the beam line) and because of the rather long lifetime of the relevant kaons (c\u00f0K AE \u00de \u00bc 3:712 m, c\u00f0K 0 L \u00de \u00bc 15:34 m [11]), only a tiny fraction of K e3 decays contributed to the background electron sample.

For p t \u00bc 1 GeV=c this contribution decreased to % 0:2% and towards higher p t it became even less.

Real photons produced in initial hard scattering processes, e.g., via quark-gluon Compton scattering, can convert in the detector material just as photons from meson decays. In addition, every source of real photons also emit virtual photons, i.e., electron-positron pairs. The spectrum of real prompt photons from an NLO pQCD calculation [63][64][65] using CTEQ6M5 parton distribution functions [66] with GRV parton-to-photon fragmentation functions [67,68] was parametrized, and the corresponding conversion electron spectrum was added to the background electron cocktail. The ratio of virtual prompt photons to real prompt photons increases with increasing p t because the phase space for dielectron emission increases [69]. This has been taken into account in the calculation of the corresponding contribution to the background electron cocktail. Prompt photon production has not been measured in ALICE yet. Measurements at lower collision energy are in agreement with NLO pQCD calculations within uncertainties of significantly less than 50% at high p t [70]. Conservatively, a systematic uncertainty of 50% was assigned to the contribution from prompt photons to the total background electron cocktail.",

Statistical uncertainties in the inclusive electron measurement are shown as error bars, while systematic uncertainties are indicated by boxes. The background contribution from photon conversions is smaller in the TPC-TOF/TPC-TRD-TOF analysis because in this case a hit in the first pixel layer is required for electron candidate tracks. Consequently, the ratio of the measured inclusive electron yield to the calculated electron background is larger for the TPC-TOF/TPC-TRD-TOF analysis than for the TPC-EMCal analysis as shown in the lower left and right panels of Fig. 10, respectively. The differential production cross section of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is calculated by first subtracting the background cocktail from the inclusive electron spectrum and then multiplying the difference with the minimum bias pp cross section MB . The corresponding systematic uncertainties propagated from the inclusive electron measurement and the electron background cocktail are summarized in Table VIII. The value for MB is 62:2 AE 2:2\u00f0sys\u00de mb. This number was obtained by relating MB to the cross section VOAND sampled with the V0AND trigger [71]. The latter corresponds to the coincidence between signals in the two VZERO detectors as measured in a van der Meer scan [72]. The relative factor VOAND = MB is equal to 0.873 and stable within 1% over the analyzed data sample. The corresponding systematic uncertainty of 3.5% is due to uncertainties of the measured beam intensities and in the analysis procedure of the van der Meer scan [73]. As demonstrated in Fig. 11, the resulting cross sections from the TPC-TOF/TPC-TRD-TOF and TPC-EMCal analyses agree with each other within the experimental uncertainties.",

Assuming that the latter is equal to the neutral pion production cross section the ratio \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 was calculated with substantial statistical uncertainties as shown in Fig. 12. At ISR energies, the ratio \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 is of the order \u00f01-2\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 without a significant p t dependence in the range below 5 GeV=c, which is dominated by charm hadron decays. At ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:2 TeV, production cross sections of both electrons from heavyflavor hadron decays [17] and pions [75][76][77] have been measured with the PHENIX experiment in pp collisions at RHIC. The ratio \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 was evaluated at given values of p t in the range 0:3 < p t < 9 GeV=c as shown in Fig. 12.

At RHIC, a pronounced p t dependence of the ratio \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 is observed. From the low p t ( $ 1 GeV=c) to the beauty-hadron decay dominated high p t region ( $ 9 GeV=c) \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 rises by at least a factor of two, consistent with the beauty production cross section rising faster with ffiffi ffi s p than the charm production cross section. At the LHC, the increase of the ratio \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 with p t is even larger. In the present measurement at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV, \u00f0e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 \u00de=2 0 grows by almost an order of magnitude from the charm decay dominated low p t region to % 10 \u00c02 in the beauty dominated high p t region.",

Production cross section ratios of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays and neutral pions in pp collisions measured as function of p t with ALICE at the LHC, PHENIX at RHIC [17,[75][76][77], and the CCRS experiment at the ISR [12,74]. Error bars are statistical errors. Systematic uncertainties are depicted by boxes (ALICE) and brackets (PHENIX). [78] were used. To obtain the uncertainty of the calculation, indicated by dashed-dotted lines in Fig. 13, the factorisation and renormalization scales F and R , respectively, were varied independently in the ranges 0:5 < F =m t < 2 and 0:5 < R =m t < 2, with the additional constraint 0:5 < F = R < 2, where m t is the transverse mass of the heavy quarks. The charm quark mass was varied in FONLL within the range 1:3 < m c < 1:7 GeV=c 2 and the beauty quark mass was varied within 4:5 < m b < 5:0 GeV=c 2 [2]. For electrons from charm hadron decays, the contributions from D 0 and D \u00fe decays were weighted with the measured D 0 =D \u00fe ratio [28]. Variations due to different choices of the parton distributions functions were also included in the theoretical uncertainty. The differential cross section of electrons from heavy-flavor decays in the rapidity interval jyj < 0:5 is shown in comparison with the FONLL prediction on an absolute scale in the upper panel of Fig. 13. In addition to charm and beauty hadron decays to electrons also the cascade beauty to charm to electron is included. Statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurement are depicted as error bars and boxes, respectively. The cross section and uncertainty from FONLL are shown as solid and dashed-dotted lines, respectively.",

The p t -differential production cross section, d=dp t , published by ATLAS is divided bin by bin by 2p t \u00c1y,  where p t is the center of the individual transverse momentum bins chosen by ATLAS and \u00c1y is the rapidity interval covered by the ATLAS measurement. The result is shown together with the electron cross section presented in this paper in Fig. 14. While the electron measurement by ALICE includes most of the total cross section, the data from ATLAS extend the measurement to higher p t . Corresponding FONLL pQCD calculations in the rapidity intervals covered by ALICE and ATLAS, respectively, are included for comparison in Fig. 14 as well. Within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties FONLL is in agreement with both data sets. It should be noted that the invariant cross section per unit rapidity decreases with increasing width of the rapidity interval because the heavy-flavor production cross section decreases towards larger absolute rapidity values. However, this effect is small in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV ( < 5% for electrons from charm decays and <10% for electrons from beauty decays according to FONLL calculations).",

Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties a perturbative QCD calculation in the framework of FONLL is consistent with the measured differential cross section. The data presented in this paper extend a corresponding measurement from ATLAS, which is restricted to the high p t region, toward substantially lower transverse momenta. This low p t region includes the dominant fraction of the total heavy-flavor production cross section, and future higher-precision data might be sensitive to the parton distribution function of the proton at low x.",
