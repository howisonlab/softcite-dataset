The technique employed subtracts the otherwise dominant Casimir force at the outset and, when combined with a lock-in amplification technique, leads to a significant improvement (up to a factor 10 3 ) over existing limits on the strength (relative to gravity) of a putative force in the 40-8000 nm interaction range.",

Unification theories, such as string theory, which introduce n compact extra spatial dimensions, predict deviations from Newtonian gravity over sub-mm scales [1,2]. Also, many extensions to the Standard Model predict the existence of new light bosons, the exchange of which would lead to new forces. In both cases, the existence of compact extra dimensions or exchange of new light bosons, the non-Newtonian interaction between two point masses m 1 and m 2 separated by a distance r can be parametrized as",

            "text": "where G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, \u03b1 is the strength of the Yukawa-like correction arising from new physics, and \u03bb is its characteristic range. In the case of compact extra dimensions, \u03bb closely corresponds to the size of the extra-dimension. For the exchange of a boson of mass m, \u03bb = /mc [6]. Motivated in part by these considerations a large number of experiments have been conducted to constrain the value of \u03b1 (see for example the reviews [3,4]). While they have been successful in constraining |\u03b1| < 1 for \u03bb > 50 \u00b5m [5], the limits on \u03b1 are much less restrictive for \u03bb < 10 \u00b5m. Constraints on \u03b1 for small values of \u03bb are much more difficult to achieve due to the small effective masses (i.e. mass within a distance r \u223c \u03bb of the surface) interacting through the Yukawa-like contribution. Compounding the problem at sub-micron separations, the effects of vacuum fluctuations eventually become dominant after electrostatic contributions have been minimized. Hence, many of the limits in the \u03bb \u2208 [10, 10000] nm range have been obtained by subtracting from the measured interaction the calculated contribution from the Casimir force [7][8][9][10] which arises from vacuum fluctua-tions. While useful, this approach has two main drawbacks: (i) The subtracted background is relatively large, and hence small corrections to the background result in large changes in the derived limits; (ii) It is not clear what the appropriate background to subtract is. While some groups use a plasma model for the extrapolation to zero frequency of the dielectric function of the metal, others use a Drude model [11]. The correct approach remains a matter of controversy, and new experiments have been proposed to help resolve this problem [12].",

(1). Different materials differ not only in their densities but also in their response to vacuum fluctuations, and hence these effects must be suppressed when searching for the presence of putative new forces at sub-micron separations. The \"isoelectronic\" or \"Casimir-less\" technique introduced in [13] capitalizes on the fact that the response of a sample to vacuum fluctuations is mainly a surface effect, whereas any new force interacts with a portion within range \u223c \u03bb of its surface. In the \"Casimirless\" technique contributions from vacuum fluctuations are suppressed by coating the source mass with a layer of Au of thickness larger than the plasma wavelength of Au, \u03bb p = 135 nm such that the difference in the Casimir interaction between the underlying structure in the source mass with the test mass is attenuated by a factor larger than 10 6 [13,15]. The Au layer thus serves not only to reduce conventional electrostatic effects as in other experiments but, more significantly, to suppress vacuum fluctuation contributions associated with the composition of the test mass.",

The test mass was harmonically positioned over the two sides of the source mass at \u03c9 1 while the separation between the test and source masses was harmonically varied with amplitude \u03b4z at \u03c9 2 = \u03c9 r \u2212 \u03c9 1 , effectively reducing the hypothetical Yukawa-like signal by \u03b4z/\u03bb \u223c 0.02.

The experiments were performed at P 10 \u22125 torr and the motion of the plate was detected by the change in capacitance between the plate and the underlying electrodes as in [13,17,18]. Calibration of the MTO was performed by using the electrostatic interaction between the Au-coated test and source masses [17]. The calibration was performed with the source mass stationary, and the distance was monitored and measured using a two-color interferometer (with a sensitivity of 0.2 nm).

The source mass was fabricated by depositing a d Cr = 10 nm thick layer of Cr on a 1 inch diameter 100 \u00b5m thick [100] oriented Si wafer. A d tm = 2.10 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m thick layer of Si was deposited on top of the Cr covered Si wafer. Using conventional pho-tolithography, a photoresist structure consisting of concentric sectors was defined in the Si. The Si not covered by the photoresist was removed down to the Cr layer using CF 4 reactive ion etching. After removing the photoresist, Au was thermally evaporated and the structure mechanically polished to expose the Si sectors. This process defined a structure with a surface consisting of a center circle of Au with a radius R 1 = 4 mm, then a 200 \u00b5m wide ring with 50 sectors of Au/Si, and a 150 \u00b5m wide Au ring. The sequence of 200 \u00b5m wide rings with Au/Si sectors and 150 \u00b5m wide Au rings was repeated with the number of Au/Si sectors increasing by 25 for each concentric ring until the last one with 300 sectors, which was located at R 11 = 7.5 mm. This structure was glued with NOA61 UV curing cement to a BK7 Schott glass flat with the original Si wafer exposed. The wafer was etched away using KOH, and then a d Au = 150\u00b13 nm layer of Au was deposited by thermal evaporation. The exposed Au surface was characterized by white light interferometry (WLI) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which showed an optical quality film with no memory of the underlying structure. The 1024 \u00d7 1024 AFM images obtained over different 10 \u00b5m \u00d710 \u00b5m regions yielded position-independent 60 nm peak-to-peak topographic roughness. Excluding a few isolated spikes \u223c 50 nm tall and about 100 nm across, the sample has a rms roughness of 1.5 nm. The disk was then mounted on an air bearing spindle. It was optically verified that the center of the disk and the axis of rotation of the spindle coincided to better than \u2206r \u223c 10 \u00b5m. The flatness and alignment of the sample were checked in-situ using a fiber interferometer (response time 10 ms). It was found that the surface of the sample was perpendicular to the axis of rotation to better than z 0 = 20 nm at R 11 when rotating the disk at \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 rad/s. The air bearing spindle worked under a constant air flow of several liters/min. The top of the source mass was at a distance D = 4 cm from the air exhaust. To prevent air leaks into the chamber, the spindle was mounted with a circular skirt which rotated with the spindle. The seal between the skirt and the vacuum chamber was provided by high molecular weight oil. Oil contamination inside the chamber was precluded using chilled water refrigeration (T = 10 \u2022 C) on a system of baffles and traps.",

Many features are worth noting: (i) Increasing the integration time \u03c4 decreases the random noise of the measured force, as expected. (ii) At separations z \u2264 300 nm the statistical noise is larger than the minimum detectable force. This happens in a region where the Casimir force is large. At larger separations, the statistical noise is close to the minimum detectable force. It was also observed that this noise was independent of the angular frequency of the disk (for \u03c9 2\u03c0 \u2208 [0.2, 20] Hz). (iii) There is a separation-dependent net force measured, which is practically independent of the radial position of the sphere over the rotating disk.

Inserting these data into F C (z) yields a contribution \u2206F top < 0.05 fN.
