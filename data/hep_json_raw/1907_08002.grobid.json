The decay mode \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is used for \u03b7 meson reconstruction in the data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 78.3 pb \u22121 . The energy dependence of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section is fitted within the framework of vector meson dominance in order to extract the \u0393(\u03c1(1450) \u2192 e + e \u2212 )B(\u03c1(1450) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and the \u0393(\u03c1(1700) \u2192 e + e \u2212 )B(\u03c1(1700) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) products. Based on conservation of vector current, the analyzed data are used to test the relationship between the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section and the spectral function in \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decay. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section obtained with the CMD-3 detector is in good agreement with the previous measurements.",

In the previous experiments it has been shown that this isovector final state is mainly produced through the \u03b7\u03c1(770) intermediate mechanism [1,2]. As a part of the total hadronic cross section, the cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is interesting for the calculations of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment [3][4][5]. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section data can be also used to study the properties of the \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700) resonances, as well as to obtain the hadronic spectral function for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decay and thus test conservation of vector current [6].",

Magnetic field of 1.3 T inside the tracking system is provided by the superconducting solenoid, which surrounds the drift and Zchambers. The barrel electromagnetic calorimeter is situated outside the superconducting solenoid and consists of two parts. The first part is the liquid xenon calorimeter (a thickness is 5.4X 0 , where X 0 is a radiation length), which allows photon coordinates to be measured with the accuracy of 1-2 mm [24]. The second part is the calorimeter composed of CsI(Tl) and CsI(Na) crystals (a thickness of 8.1X 0 ). This calorimeter consists of 8 octants and contains 1152 counters. The endcap calorimeter [25] consists of two identical endcaps, each containing 340 BGO crystals with a thickness of 13.4X 0 .",

To begin with, events are selected with two oppositely charged particles originating from the beam interaction region. In addition, it is required that the selected events contain at least two photons with energies greater than 50 MeV to suppress background processes with lowenergy photons. Also excluded are photons, which pass through the BGO crystals closest to the beam axis. For each selected event all photon pairs are considered and a kinematic fit is performed within the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 hypothesis using the constraints of energymomentum conservation and requiring all particles to originate from a common vertex. The photons from the pair corresponding to the smallest chi-square of the kinematic fit, \u03c7 2 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 , are considered as candidates for the photons from the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay.

Further, these models will be referred as \"Model 1\" and \"Model 2\", respectively. One also has to take into account a well-known fact about the ambiguity of determination of parameters for a few interfering resonances. According to ref. [40], 2 n\u22121 local minima for the fit to the cross section are expected, where n is the number of resonances. This formula has been obtained under the assumption that the widths of the resonances do not depend on energy. In this work, two local minima were actually obtained for the fit in the case of the \u03c1(770) and the \u03c1(1450) presence. Further, these local minima are referred to as \"Model 1, solution 1\" and \"Model 1, solution 2\". When the \u03c1(1700) contribution is also taken into account, two local minima are observed instead of four. In the following, they are referred to as \"Model 2, solution 1\" and \"Model 2, solution 2\". The fact that there are two local minima only is probably due to width energy dependence and the cross section uncertainties.",
