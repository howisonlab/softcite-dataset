Underground sites are also the most suitable location for very low background \u03b3-ray spectrometers, able to assay trace radioactive contaminants. Many operational infrastructures are already available worldwide for science, differing for depth, dimension and rock characteristics. Other underground sites are emerging as potential new laboratories. In this paper the European underground sites are reviewed, giving a particular emphasis on their relative strength and complementarity. A coordination and integration effort among the European Union underground infrastructures was initiated by the EU-funded ILIAS project and proved to be very effective.",

In fact experiments must be built out of very radiopure materials, and most of them place very stringent requirements on radioactive contaminants. Therefore, materials and components to be used for experiments must be screened by ultra-sensitive Ge spectrometers in order to be qualified for actual use. The background level required for HPGe spectrometers to be sensitive to radioactive contamination down to a few mBq/kg can be practically achieved in underground laboratories only. In principle, ultra-sensitive \u03b3-ray spectrometry does not require very deep sites since after a few hundreds of m w.e. the total background is dominated by the radioactivity of the passive shielding. Nevertheless, virtually all underground laboratories host one or more Ge spectrometers as a screening facility for ultra low-background radioactivity assays. Furthermore, ultra-sensitive \u03b3-ray spectrometers in underground laboratories are used for a variety of additional scientific applications, e.g. environmental monitoring and radio-dating, as well as for the development of new detector technologies.",

It is the deepest underground infrastructure available in Western Europe, its minimum rock overburden being 4000 m w.e. (average overburden: 4800 m w.e.). The access to the laboratory is horizontal, through the single-way Frejus roadway tunnel. Intervention of the tunnel control is actually requested to stop the traffic and allow the entrance/exit of vehicles to the laboratory. The excavation started in 1979 and the first experiment -a 900 ton iron tracking calorimeter to search for proton decay (\"Frejus experiment\") -was commissioned in 1982. The underground site is composed by a Main Hall, 30 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 11 m 3 , a 70 m 2 Gamma Spectrometry Hall hosting 13 HPGe detectors, and two secondary halls (18 and 21 m 2 ), totaling about 400 m 2 . Surface facilities located in the city of Modane include offices and a warehouse. The muon flux has been measured to be 5.76 \u2022 10 \u22125 \u00b5/(m 2 \u2022s) [6], namely five muons per m 2 per day. The flux of fast neutrons (above 1 MeV) which has been re-measured in the framework of the EDELWEISS experiment is [7]. The thermal neutron flux is about 1.9 \u2022 10 \u22122 n/(m 2 \u2022s) [8]. The laboratory has been also characterized in term of primordial radionuclides contained in the rock(concrete): 0.84(1.9) ppm for 238 U and 2.45(1.4) ppm for 232 Th. The Potassium content of the rock is 6.9 (= 213 Bq/kg of 40 K). The average 222 Rn content in the underground site is about 15 Bq/m 3 when ventilation is on (1.5 volumes per hour). Recently, an \"anti-radon\" facility was built underground which is able to produce Rn-free air (about 15 mBq/m 3 ) at a rate of 150 m 3 /h. The Rn-free air is necessary to meet the background specifications for the NEMO3 neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u03bd2\u03b2 ) experiment. At the moment, the laboratory is completely filled by two main experiments, EDELWEISS-II (dark matter search) and NEMO3 (0\u03bd2\u03b2 ), and by a low-radioactivity counting facility. Other experiments having a smaller footprint, TGV-II (0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay) and SHIN (nuclear physics), are also located in the laboratory. The Gamma Spectrometry Hall hosts 13 HPGe low-background detectors, belonging to six different institutions. They are routinely used for radio-assay and qualification of materials to be used for the experiments but also for other applications, including environmental measurement and applications (wine dating, salt origin, etc.).",

It is located under the Gran Sasso mountain, in central Italy, and it is by far the largest underground laboratory in the world, serving the largest and most international scientific community. The vehicle access to the laboratory (cars and trucks) is through the A24 freeway (two-way) tunnel and does not require any specific safety procedure. The total underground area is 17 000 m 2 (volume: 180 000 m 3 ). The laboratory encompasses three main halls (named A, B and C), each about 100 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 18 m 3 , plus ancillary tunnels, providing space for services, plants and smallerscale experiments.  [11]. The 222 Rn specific activity in the underground halls is between 50 and 120 Bq/m 3 when the ventilation is on (one volume in 3.5 hours). The abundance of primordial radionuclides in the rock(concrete) is about 0.42(1.05) ppm for 238 U and 0.062(0.656) ppm for 232 Th, respectively. The Potassium concentration in the Gran Sasso rock (Hall B) amounts to 160 ppm, corresponding to 4.9 Bq/kg of 40 K; the Hall A rock has a much higher Potassium concentration, approx. 7 . The current experimental program at LNGS is very rich, including CERN to Gran Sasso beam experiments (OPERA and ICARUS); neutrinoless double beta decay searches (CUORE, GERDA and COBRA); dark matter searches (DAMA/Libra, WArP, CRESST and XENON); solar and geo-neutrinos (Borexino); supernova neutrinos (LVD); nuclear astrophysics (LUNA). The laboratory is operated as an international science facility and hosts also non-INFN physics experiments, whose scientific value is assessed by an international advisory Scientific Committee. The laboratory is also supporting small-scale measurements on geology, biology and environmental issues. Many former experiments located at Gran Sasso -and now decommissioned -were at the leading frontier at that time. Among them, Gallex/GNO (solar neutrinos) and MACRO (atmospheric neutrinos and cosmic rays). The laboratory hosts an underground low-background facility, STELLA (SubTErranean Low Level Assay), consisting of about 10 HPGe \u03b3 spectrometers. Applications of the facility include material screening for experiments (radiopurity assay), background characterization, physics measurements (e.g. search for rare decays) and environmental measurements ( 222 Rn in ground water, radio-dating). The facility occupies a surface of about 32 m 2 in a connection tunnel and it hosts the most sensitive HPGe \u03b3-spectrometer in the world, GEMPI2. The total background rate of the GEMPI2 detector is 44 counts/(kg\u2022day) (integral between 40 and 2700 keV); the background rate at the 40 K 1460-keV peak is 0.13 counts/(kg\u2022day) [12,13].",

The laboratory was operated by the University of Saragossa and fully characterized in terms of background. Several experiments were performed in the old Canfranc laboratory, notably IGEX (0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay), ROSEBUD and ANAIS (dark matter searches). Taking profit from the excavation of a new parallel road tunnel, a new laboratory has been recently built. Excavation started in 2005 and the underground laboratory has been completed after the civil engineering on July 2010. The new Canfranc laboratory is managed by a Consortium including the Spanish Ministry for Education and Science, the Government of Aragon and the University of Saragossa. The new underground facility contains two main halls (labeled Hall A and Hall B) having surface of 600 m 2 (40 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 12 m 3 ) and 150 m 2 (15 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 8 m 3 ), respectively, and ancillary tunnels and services (e.g. clean room). Surface infrastructures, for a total area of about 1500 m 2 are also being built. The access is horizontal via one of the available road tunnels.

In particular, the abundance of primordial radionuclides in the laboratory salt is 67 ppb for 238 U, 125 ppb for 232 Th and 1130 ppm for Potassium. The average 222 Rn content in the underground site is less than 3 Bq/m 3 . The scientific activity of the Boulby laboratory is mainly focused on dark matter searches. The laboratory hosted the ZEPLIN-II experiment (completed in 2008) and is presently hosting its upgraded version, ZEPLIN-III, as well as the DRIFT-II R&D. The future planning is still focused on dark matter searches but it pursues the further development of very low-background facilities for material screening and is open to future small and large projects, as LAGUNA.

            "text": "The Baksan Neutrino Observatory, located under the Mount Andyrchi in the Russian Caucasus, is the oldest underground facility in the world which was explicitly built for scientific purposes. The excavation started in 1966 and experimental activities started in the 70s. A new village, called 'Neutrino', was built as a part of the original project to host personnel and services (offices, water supply, heating). The laboratory is operated by the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The underground facilities are located along two parallel horizontal tunnels, each 4 km long, excavated into the side of Mt. Andyrchi. The access is horizontal through the entrance tunnel, which is equipped with a rail system for the transportation of personnel and equipment. Several experimental halls are available, which are located at different distance from the entrance and have a different rock overburden. The BUST Hall (24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 16 m 3 ) has the least rock overburden (about 850 m w.e.) and hosts the BUST neutrino telescope, ready since 1978 to detect neutrinos from a galactic supernova explosion. The other main hall, having dimension 60 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 12 m 3 and much larger overburden (4800 m w.e. vertical depth) hosts the SAGE solar neutrino experiment, which is operational since 1992. The SAGE site is lined with 60 cm of low-background concrete, to further reduce the neutron and \u03b3-ray fluxes coming from the rock. The excavation of a larger and deeper hall, which started in 1990, was abandoned at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its status is presently undefined. A few smaller halls with intermediate rock overburden are used for R&D on dark matter and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay and host a screening facility with HPGe detectors. The laboratory is actually operated as an observatory, in the sense that its program foresees very long duration measurements. The muon flux in the SAGE hall is 3.03 \u2022 10 \u22125 \u00b5/(m 2 \u2022s) [17]. The total neutron flux between 1 and 11 MeV is less than 2.3 \u2022 10 \u22123 n/(m 2 \u2022s) [18]. The total 222 Rn contamination in the laboratory is about 40 Bq/m 3 , when the ventilation (7 volumes per hour) is on.",

The Laboratory was established in 1984 and it is operated by the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.

The access to the laboratory is vertical through the mine shaft. A small surface facility is available with offices and living rooms. The rock profile is practically flat and the minimum overburden is about 1000 m w.e., giving a muon flux in the experimental hall of 1.7 \u2022 10 \u22122 \u00b5/(m 2 \u2022s) [19,20]. The thermal neutron flux is < 2.7 \u2022 10 \u22122 n/(m 2 \u2022s) [19]. The particular rock composition (salt) yields a lower \u03b3-ray background with respect to laboratories excavated in ordinary rock, as discussed for the Boulby Laboratory, because of the lower concentration of primordial radionuclides of the 232 Th and 238 U series. The radon concentration in the laboratory air is 33 Bq/m 3 . The laboratory hosts a number of small-and medium-scale R&D projects focused on 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay (especially for SUPER-NEMO) and on the development of radiopure scintillating crystals for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay and dark matter experiments. Dedicated experiments on the \u03b2 \u03b2 decay of 116 Cd are also performed using pure 116 CdWO 4 crystals.",

The mine has a hive-like structure composed by several galleries, each 32-36 m wide and 54-58 m high. The total floor area amounts to more than 70 000 m 2 . A Low Background Radiation Laboratory with HPGe detectors is sitting at a depth of 208 m beneath the surface, corresponding to about 580 m w.e. [21]. The access to the mine is vertical, through two elevators connected to the surface, each with 45-ton capacity. While the site is too shallow for most astroparticle physics experiments (dark matter search, 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay) because of the \u00b5-induced background, it is an ideal place for a very low-background \u03b3-spectrometry facility. In fact, the salt in the mine is extremely poor in primordial radionuclides of the 232 Th and 238 U series. The total dose measured in the underground area is 1.17 \u00b1 0.14 nGy/h, which is about 80 times smaller than the value on the surface. No dedicated measurements have been performed up to now to evaluate the muon and neutron fluxes. The Unirea site is a possible candidate to host the LAGUNA initiative. A few HPGe detectors are presently operational underground.",

The four main deep-underground laboratories in Western Europe (LNGS, LSM, Boulby and LSC) are very well established and all of them have a rich experimental program encompassing dark matter searches, neutrinoless double beta decay, neutrino physics and astroparticle physics. The four laboratories are the backbone of the EU deep underground scientific infrastructures. A closer coordination among them started in the framework of the ILIAS program, funded by the EU between 2004 and 2009. A memorandum of understanding (EULab) was signed after the end of ILIAS to improve the long-term laboratory coordination. The Baksan underground laboratory, in Russia, is still operational, in spite of difficulties, mainly providing an observatory service to the scientific community. Other \"emerging\" sites are becoming available, especially in Eastern Europe. While at the moment they lack of the necessary infrastructures to host full-scale physics experiments, their background is being characterized and they are potential hosts for future physics programs.",
