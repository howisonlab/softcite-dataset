The analysis is performed on 1.04 f b \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Numerous models predict the production of new massive particles that decay preferentially to a top-anti-top pair, including Randall-Sundrum models where the observation of a Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon may be the first indication of the existence of an extra spatial dimension. In the analysis presented, a simple observable, sensitive to resonance mass, is formed by summing the missing transverse energy, and the transverse momenta of the selected jets and the two candidate leptons. A deviation from the Standard Model prediction for this observable is searched for using Bayesian statistical methods that compare the yields, and shapes, of the Standard Model background and signal predictions for KK-gluons with masses between 500 and 1600 GeV. No excess over the Standard Model is observed and 95% C.L. upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio to top quarks for KK-gluon-like resonances. The results of the analysis exclude Randall-Sundrum KK-gluons with masses less than 840 GeV.",

As a result, the top quark has a special role in many scenarios that go beyond the Standard Model (SM), many of which predict new particles that decay preferentially to top anti-top quark pairs [1]. One such scenario is the Randall-Sundrum model with a single finite extradimension (RS1) where the SM fermions and gauge bosons can propagate in the bulk. In this scenario the observation of the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the gluon may be the first indication of the existence of an extra spatial dimension [2]. Such a new particle would manifest itself at the LHC as a massive tt resonance.",

The presence of two neutrinos from the W decays in the final state complicate full mass reconstruction. The scalar sum of the transverse momenta, p T , of selected leptons and jets, denoted H T , is measured and combined with the missing transverse energy expected from the neutrinos to form the variable H T + E miss T .",
