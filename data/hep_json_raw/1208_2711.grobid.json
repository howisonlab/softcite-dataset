The data are presented in the p T range 0.15 < p T < 50 GeV/c for nine centrality intervals from 70-80% to 0-5%. The results in Pb-Pb are presented in terms of the nuclear modification factor R AA using a pp reference spectrum measured at the same collision energy. We observe that the suppression of high-p T particles strongly depends on event centrality. The yield is most suppressed in central collisions (0-5%) with R AA \u2248 0.13 at p T = 6-7 GeV/c. Above p T = 7 GeV/c, there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification factor, which reaches R AA \u2248 0.4 for p T > 30 GeV/c. In peripheral collisions (70-80%), only moderate suppression (R A A = 0.6-0.7) and a weak p T dependence is observed.",

At sufficiently high temperature, it is expected that partons (quarks and gluons) are the dominant degrees of freedom. During the very early stage of the collision, some of the incoming partons experience scatterings with large momentum transfers. These partons lose energy when they traverse the hot and dense medium that is formed. One of the major goals of the heavy-ion physics programme at the LHC is to understand the underlying mechanisms for parton energy loss and use this as a tool to probe the properties of the medium.",

For this study, the events are divided into nine centrality intervals from the 70-80% to the 0-5% most central Pb-Pb collisions, expressed in percentage of the total hadronic cross section. The event centrality can be related to the number of participating nucleons N part and the nuclear overlap function T AA by using simulations based on the Glauber model [14]. The average values of N part and T AA for each centrality interval, N part and T AA , along with their corresponding systematic uncertainties, are listed in Table 1  [11]). The primary vertex position was determined from the tracks reconstructed in the ITS and the TPC by using an analytic \u03c7 2 minimization method, applied after approximating each of the tracks by a straight line in the vicinity of their common origin. The event is accepted if the coordinate of the reconstructed vertex measured along the beam direction (z-axis) is within \u00b110 cm around the nominal interaction point. The event vertex reconstruction is fully efficient for the event centralities covered. Primary charged particles are defined as all prompt particles produced in the collision, including decay products, except those from weak decays of strange hadrons. A set of standard cuts based on the number of space points and the quality of the momentum fit in the TPC and ITS is applied to the reconstructed tracks. Track candidates in the TPC are required to have hits in at least 120 (out of a maximum of 159) pad-rows and \u03c7 2 per point of the momentum fit smaller than 4. Such tracks are projected to the ITS and used for further analysis if at least 2 matching hits (out of a maximum of 6) in the ITS, including at least one in the SPD, are found. In addition, the \u03c7 2 per point of the momentum fit in the ITS must be smaller than 36. In order to improve the purity of primary track reconstruction at high p T we developed a procedure where we compare tracking information from the combined ITS and TPC track reconstruction algorithm to that derived only from the TPC and constrained by the interaction vertex point. We calculated the \u03c7 2 TPC-ITS between these tracks using the following formula",

We used a HIJING tune which reproduces approximately the measured charged particle density in central collisions [11]. In the most central events, the overall primary charged particle reconstruction efficiency (tracking efficiency and acceptance) in |\u03b7| < 0.8 is 36% at p T = 0.15 GeV/c and increases to 65% for p T > 0.6 GeV/c. In the most peripheral events the efficiency is larger than that for the central events by about 1-3%. The contribution from secondary particles was estimated using the d xy distributions of data and HI-JING and is consistent with the measured strangeness to charged particle ratio from the reconstruction of K 0 s , \u039b and \u039b invariant mass peaks in Pb-Pb [22]. The total contribution from secondary tracks at p T = 0.15 GeV/c is 13 (7)% for central (peripheral) events and decreases to about 0.6% above p T = 4 GeV/c for both central and peripheral events. From a systematic variation of the \u03c7 2 TPC-ITS cut and comparison of track properties in MC to data we conclude that the number of properly reconstructed tracks rejected as high-p T fake tracks is around 1-2% (0.5-1%) in the most central (peripheral) collisions. We also conclude that the contribution from the high-p T fake tracks to the p T spectra is negligible independently of the collision centrality and p T .",

We also varied the event and track quality selection criteria and the Monte Carlo assumptions to estimate systematic uncertainties on the p T spectra. In particular, we studied a variation of the most abundant charged particle species (pions, kaons, protons) by \u00b130% to match the measured ratios and their uncertainties [22]. The material budget was varied by \u00b17% [23], and the secondary yield from strangeness decays in the Monte Carlo by \u00b130% to match the measured d xy distributions. Moreover, we used a different event generator, DPMJET [24], to calculate MC correction maps.

At low p T , the transverse momentum spectra differ from the pp reference. This is in agreement with the previously observed scaling behavior of the total charged particle production as a function of centrality [11]. A marked depletion of the spectra at high transverse momentum (p T > 5 GeV/c) develops gradually as centrality increases, indicating strong suppression of high-p T particle production in central collisions. The nuclear modification factors for nine centrality intervals are shown in Fig. 2. In peripheral collisions (70-80%), only moderate suppression (R AA = 0.6-0.7) and a weak p T dependence is observed. Towards more central collisions, a pronounced minimum at about p T = 6-7 GeV/c develops while for p T > 7 GeV/c there is a significant rise of the nuclear modification factor. This rise becomes gradually less steep with increasing p T . In the most central collisions (0-5%), the yield is most suppressed, R AA \u2248 0.13 at p T = 6-7 GeV/c, and R AA reaches \u2248 0.4 with no significant p T dependence for p T > 30 GeV/c.",

Also shown are results from PHENIX at RHIC in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [9]. The strongest centrality dependence is observed for particles with 5 < p T < 7 GeV/c. At higher p T , the centrality dependence weakens gradually. In comparison to results from RHIC, the LHC data in the same p T window show a suppression which is larger by a factor of about 1.2 at all N part (Fig. 3, top panel). This implies that the shape of the N part dependence at RHIC and the LHC is very similar when the same p T is compared, indicating a strong relation between collision geometry and energy loss. The overall increase of suppression at the LHC as compared to RHIC may be expected from the larger density and longer lifetime of the fireball. The suppression reaches similar values when results from RHIC are compared to results from the LHC in terms of dN ch /d\u03b7, as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom panel). Larger values of suppression than at RHIC are observed in central collisions at the LHC, where the charged particle multiplicity exceeds that of the most central collisions at RHIC. It should be noted that the suppression at a given centrality results from a subtle interplay between the parton p T spectrum, the quark-to-gluon ratio, and the medium density, all of which exhibit a significant energy dependence. Further model studies are needed to evaluate their relative contributions.",

These effects are predicted to be small for p T > 10 GeV/c at the LHC [26] and will be quantified in future p-Pb measurements.",

The results indicate a strong suppression of charged particle production in Pb-Pb central collisions is compared to model calculations. An increase of R AA due to a decrease of the relative energy loss with increasing p T is seen for all the models. The measurement presented here, together with measurements of particle correlations [32] and measurements using jet reconstruction [33], will help in understanding the mechanism of jet quenching and the properties of the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions.",

This has an effect of around 1.5% on the yield of the measured spectra at the highest p T . To account for the finite p T resolution, correction factors for the reconstructed p T spectra at p T > 10 GeV/c are derived using a folding procedure. The corrections depend on collision centrality due to the change of the spectral shape and reach 4(8)% at p T = 50 GeV/c in the most central (peripheral) collisions.",
