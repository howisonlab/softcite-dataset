The LHCb experiment, a dedicated heavy flavour experiment at the LHC at CERN. It has recorded the worlds largest sample of heavy meson and lepton decays. The status of the rare decay analyses with 1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 1.1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV of pp-collisions collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012 is reviewed. The worlds most precise measurements of the angular structure of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays is discussed, as well as the isospin asymmetry measurement in B \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays. The first evidence for the very rare decay B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is presented together with the most stringent upper exclusion limits on the branching fraction of decays of B 0 , D 0 and K 0 s mesons into two muons. This note finishes with the discussion of searches for lepton number and lepton flavor violating \u03c4 decays.",

In extensions to the SM, new virtual particles can enter in these loop level diagrams, modifying the decay rate or Lorentz structure of the decay vertex. Possible deviations from the SM predictions of these observables could lead to the discovery yet unknown phenomena. The search for these deviations is a complementary approach to direct searches at general purpose detectors and can give sensitivity to new particles at higher mass scales than those accessible directly.",

Most measurements use a dataset of 1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV of pp-collisions collected in 2011. The search for B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 uses a combined dataset of 1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 1.1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded in 2011 and 2012. The first part of the article discusses rare electroweak penguin transitions of the type 1 b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , which allow stringent tests of the Lorentz structure of the electroweak penguin processes. The second part discussed searches for purely leptonic decays of K 0 s , D 0 and B mesons, which are particularly sensitive to new scalar interactions. The last class of analyses discussed is the search for lepton and baryon number violating \u03c4 decays. a e-mail: albrecht@cern.ch 1 In this proceedings, the inclusion of charge conjugate states are implicit, unless otherwise stated.",

The latter can be separated from signal candidates exploiting the excellent mass resolution of the LHCb spectrometer.

This normalization reduces the systematic uncertainties which need to be considered in this analysis. The modified frequentist method [20,21], CL s , is used to evaluate the consistency of the observed pattern of events with the background and signal plus background hypotheses.

The event yield is determined from a two dimensional fit on the dimuon invariant mass and the difference between the D * \u00b1 mass and D 0 mass. The observed pattern of events is compatible with the background expectations and an upper limit on the branching fraction of B(D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 is determined at 95% CL, using the CL s method.
