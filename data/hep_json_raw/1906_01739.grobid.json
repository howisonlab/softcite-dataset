The present paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the status of light sterile neutrino searches in mid-2019: we discuss not only the basic experimental approaches and sensitivities of reactor, source, atmospheric, and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments but also the complementary bounds arising from direct neutrino mass experiments and cosmological observations. Moreover, we review current results from global oscillation analyses that include the constraints set by running reactor and atmospheric neutrino experiments. They permit to set tighter bounds on the active-sterile oscillation parameters but as yet are not able to provide a definite conclusion on the existence of eV-scale sterile neutrinos.",

Serious interest in their possible existence was sparked by a number of anomalous results in short-baseline oscillation experiments. Since the discovery of flavor oscillations two decades ago, the knowledge on neutrino mixing parameters has been continuously improving (see the recent global fits in Refs. [3][4][5]). Still, the current data of solar, atmospheric, and long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments leave some room for additional (few) percent-level mixing amplitudes to sterile states [6]. (In this case, the 3 \u00d7 3 PMNS mixing matrix is not unitary.) Using this gap, a number of existing unexpected rate deficits and appearance results at very short baselines can be elegantly explained by an additional fourth sterile neutrino accompanied by an eV-scale mass eigenstate.",

Moreover, observational cosmology sets stringent limits to the number and mass of relativistic neutrino states in the early Universe and in fact strongly disfavors an additional eV-scale neutrino, unless its early thermalization is impeded by some secondary mechanism.",

In both cases only a general reduction in the observed rate is expected as a consequence of the existence of a sterile neutrino, making the approach rather sensitive to precise knowledge of the source intensity and detection efficiency. The current follow-up experiments have been devised to provide a clear oscillation signature: Placement of radioactive sources close to or even inside a large liquid-scintillator or a segmented gallium detector allows the determination of position and energy of individual neutrino interactions (Sec. 4.2).

In this setup the uncertainty on the overall normalization and shape of the atmospheric neutrino flux limits the sensitivity in this search. On the other side this experimental configuration profits strongly from an enhancement of the oscillation signature for neutrinos crossing the earth core. All active neutrino flavors can undergo elastic forward scattering with nucleons and electrons in matter in neutral current interactions, with an additional contribution for electron neutrinos from charged current interactions (c.f.

First of all, the observable a beta-decay experiment is the squared mass of the sterile neutrino m 2 4 itself, whereas an oscillation experiment is sensitive to the squared mass difference \u2206m 2 41 of the active and sterile neutrino. Moreover, short-baseline experiments are typically sensitive to rather small sterile neutrino masses, as too large masses would imply very small oscillation lengths, which could not be resolved by current experiment. In a beta-decay experiment, in contrast, the larger the sterile neutrino mass the further away from the endpoint the signal occurs. Thus, for larger sterile neutrino mass the signal rate and hence the statistical sensitivity is increased. On the other hand, a number of systematic uncertainties increase in a region further away from the kinematic endpoint.",

Since the new mass value m 4 associated with the sterile neutrino is likely to be considerably larger than the values m 1,2,3 mostly associated with active neutrinos, the effective value of |m \u03b2\u03b2 | can vary considerable depending on the relative alignment of the Majorana phases \u03b1 k . Predictions for the possible range of |m \u03b2\u03b2 | can be displayed as a function of the effective electron neutrino mass m \u03b2 (sec. 2.2.1). Since the coherent sum depends on the allowed ranges of the oscillation parameters \u03b8 ij and \u2206m 2 ji as well as the experimentally undetermined Majorana phases \u03b1 k , each value of m \u03b2 can be associated with a broad range of allowed |m \u03b2\u03b2 | values. Figure 7 contrasts the allowed parameter spaces for the standard 3-flavor and an extended (3+1) scenario [69]. For both normal and inverted mass ordering (of the three active neutrinos), the accessible parameter range is greatly increased. Noteworthy, the range of m \u03b2 for which total cancellation of the terms in |m \u03b2\u03b2 | becomes possible for normal ordering is shifted to larger values, while \u2212 unlike for the 3-flavor case \u2212 complete cancellation becomes possible as well for inverted ordering.",

Depending on the sterile neutrino model, these effects may or may not be degenerate with other cosmological parameters affecting the background history, such as the Hubble rate H 0 .

More interesting is the distinct effect of active and sterile neutrino masses on the matter power spectrum. When massive decoupled particles like neutrinos propagate with high velocities in the recent universe, they cluster on large scales but not on small scales, simply because their speed exceeds the escape velocity from small-scale gravitational potential wells. As a consequence, the balance between gravity forces and Hubble friction is broken on small scales, and the other non-relativistic matter components (dark matter and baryons) cluster at a reduced rate.

In this approach, the measured electron spectra are described by a sum of virtual \u03b2-decay branches. The conversion to the antineutrino spectrum is then accomplished by the subtraction of the electron energy from the endpoint energy in each branch.

This assumption was tested in Daya Bay by studying the neutrino rate for different time bins during reactor fuel evolution [96]. A similar analysis was also done for RENO data [97]. Hence the observed neutrino deficit can be investigated for different fission fractions for the Pu and U fuel isotopes. The experiments observe a fuel-dependent variation of the inverse beta decay yield with respect to theoretical predictions. This finding disfavors the oscillation hypothesis as sole source of the RAA as well as a common mis-modelling of all fission isotopes by almost 3\u03c3. However, a combined analysis together with global rate data shows a preference for oscillations with respect to individual isotope-dependent suppression of the mean cross section per fission [98,99]. Hybrid models with neutrino oscillations and a prediction bias for specific fission isotopes in addition are also possible. Double Chooz, Daya Bay, and RENO observed as well distortions in the neutrino spectrum known as the reactor \"shape anomaly\" [100][101][102]. The main feature of this distortions is an excess in the measured reactor neutrino spectrum as compared to the predicted shape around 5 MeV. A similar pattern was also observed in the NEOS data [103]. However, the spectral shape measured in the Bugey 3 experiment [104] seems inconsistent with the aforementioned experiments and exhibits a flat data-to-model ratio spectrum, thus in good agreement to the prediction. For comparison, the normalized data-to-prediction spectral ratios are shown in Fig. 9  [105] for several experiments.",

The new generation of experiments might be able to identify if this shape distortion is common to all fission isotopes or caused by only part of them. Some experiments are operated at highly enriched uranium (HEU) reactors, in which mainly 235 U fissions contribute. Other experiments use commercial power reactors with low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel assemblies in which several U and Pu isotopes contribute to the neutrino flux. If the neutrino spectra of HEU and LEU reactors are compared, it might show if the 5 MeV excess is solely due to the 235 U contributions or similar for all isotopes [107]. ",

GALLEX and the subsequent GNO experiment [110] measured low-energy solar electronneutrinos at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy from 1991 until 2003. As detection reaction the inverse beta decay on 71 Ga producing 71 Ge was used. In the GALLEX/GNO detector 30.3 t of gallium in the form of a concentrated GaCl 3 -HCl solution were exposed to the neutrinos. The neutrino-induced 71 Ge as well as some inactive germanium (Ge) carrier atoms, which were added to the solution at the beginning of a run, were extracted from the tank in form of volatile GeCl 4 by a nitrogen gas stream. The nitrogen was then passed through a gas scrubber where the GeCl 4 was absorbed in water. The GeCl 4 was finally converted into GeH 4 and introduced into miniaturized proportional counters. There the number of 71 Ge atoms was counted by the detection of its electron capture reaction with a half-life of about 11 days.",

The solar phase of the experiment started in 1990 and took data for almost 20 years with a target mass of about 60 t. The Ge in the SAGE experiment was extracted from the Ga metal into an aqueous solution by an oxidation reaction. By vacuum evaporation the volume of the aqueous solution was reduced by a factor of 8. The Ge was swept from this solution as volatile GeCl 4 by a gas flow and trapped in 1 liter of water. By a solvent extraction the Ge was concentrated into a volume of 100 ml. Finally, GeH 4 gas was synthesized and moved into a proportional counter in which the decays of 71 Ge were counted.",

            "text": "In GALLEX, two intense 51 Cr neutrino sources were produced by neutron capture on 50 Cr. Isotopically enriched chromium (Cr) was irradiated in the core of the Siloe reactor in Grenoble for this purpose. The energies of the emitted neutrinos are about 750 keV (90%) and 430 keV (10%). Several different methods were used to accurately determine the source activities and a rather conservative approach was applied to estimate the systematic uncertainties. The best estimates for the source activities were (63.4 +1.1 \u22121.6 ) PBq and (69.1 +3.3 \u22122.1 ) PBq [111]. In the SAGE experiment two different sources were used for calibration: a 51 Cr source as in GALLEX and in addition an intense source of 37 Ar. In the first calibration in 1995 a (19.11\u00b10.22) PBq source of 51 Cr was placed at the center of a 13.1 t target of liquid Ga [112]. The source was produced by irradiating a sample of enriched 50 Cr with neutrons from the high-flux N-350 fast breeder nuclear reactor in Aktau, Kazakhstan. The activity was determined by calorimetry. Cross-checks from direct measurements of characteristic \u03b3-lines with Ge-counters and transport calculations of the reactor neutrons showed consistent results. Almost ten years later, in 2004, the second calibration was performed with a 37 Ar source, which was produced in the (n, \u03b1) reaction on 40 Ca [113]. Calcium oxide was irradiated in the fast neutron breeder reactor at Zarechny, Russia. The 37 Ar in the target was first dissolved in acid. After collection from the solution it was purified, sealed, and set up next to 13 t of Ga. The initial activity of this source providing neutrinos with energies of 811 keV was estimated to be (15.13 \u00b1 0.07) PBq. The number is obtained from the average of different activity determination including calorimetric, counting, and mass/volume measurements. If the calibration runs of GALLEX and SAGE are averaged and compared to the predicted neutrino signal of the sources, a deficit of about 15% is observed with a significance of 3\u03c3, see Fig. 10  [13]. This mismatch is known as the gallium anomaly. For each of the calibrations, the experimental uncertainty on the measured production rate is statistically dominated. Since the time of the first three of the four calibration runs, the deficit as well as its significance were continuously increasing. In the late 1990ies, the combined result of two runs in GALLEX as well as the first Cr calibration in SAGE were each compatible with the prediction within less than 1\u03c3. With the Ar calibration in SAGE the combined deficit already reached the 2\u03c3 level. The tension increased after a re-analysis of the GALLEX data [114] and updated estimates on the contribution of transitions to excited states of 71 Ge [115].",

The neutrino interaction cross section on 71 Ga has contributions from excited states which were originally estimated from (p, n) reactions and found to be about 5% with a large uncertainty [116]. More recent measurements resulted in an increasing and more precise value for these contributions of (7.2 \u00b1 2.0) % [115], amplifying the significance of the anomaly to the current 3\u03c3 level. If these excited states would not be populated as strongly by the weak interaction mechanism [117], the anomaly would reduce again to less than 2\u03c3. At least until the RAA was reported, a smaller than expected contribution of these excited states was regarded as the most likely cause for the deficit, in particular by SAGE and GALLEX experts [114,118]. The high relevance of the knowledge on the cross sections is underlined by the most recent theoretical estimates. These new calculations reduce the predicted values for the cross sections by 2.5-3% weakening the significance of the Ga anomaly from 3.0 to 2.3\u03c3 [119].",

Protons of 800 MeV were aimed at a fixed target to generate low-energy charged pions that were stopped within the target material before decaying. The overwhelming majority of pions (and subsequent muons) decaying were bearing positive charge, producing relatively low-energy \u03bd e 's, \u03bd \u00b5 's, and\u03bd \u00b5 's but crucially no\u03bd e 's. The corresponding decay of \u03c0 \u2212 's is strongly suppressed by capture on the target atoms. The residual\u03bd e background flux is only on the level of \u223c 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 of the\u03bd \u00b5 flux.",

            "text": "The difficulty of explaining the MiniBooNE low-energy excess of electron-like events with neutrino oscillations compatible with the constraints of other experiments has prompted several studies of alternative explanations. One possibility is that the excess is not due to \u03bd e -induced electrons, but to photons that could have been produced by the decay of \u03c0 0 's generated by neutral-current \u03bd \u00b5 interactions in the detector [127][128][129][130], and cannot be distinguished from electrons in the MiniBooNE detector. This possibility will be investigated in the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors of the SBN program (see Section 4.4.1), that can distinguish electrons from photons. Another possibility is that the MiniBooNE low-energy excess is generated by non-standard particles produced in the Mini-BooNE target or in the MiniBooNE detector. The first case has been excluded in Ref. [131] by noting that non-standard particles produced in the MiniBooNE target must decay in the MiniBooNE detector producing a visible electron-like signal that is rather strongly peaked in the forward direction and cannot fit the angular distribution of the MiniBooNE electron-like excess [122]. The remaining possibility is the production in the MiniBooNE detector of a non-standard heavy particle that decays producing an electron-like signal. The existing hypotheses involve a heavy neutrino \u03bd 4 with a mass m 4 larger than about 40 MeV, that is mostly sterile and is produced in the detector by neutral-current \u03bd \u00b5 interactions through a small mixing U \u00b54 . The possibility of a radiative decay of the heavy \u03bd 4 [132][133][134] is excluded by the angular distribution of the MiniBooNE electron-like excess [135]. Recent studies [136][137][138][139] considered the possibility of a heavy \u03bd 4 that is charged under a new U (1) gauge group. The corresponding gauge boson Z can have kinetic mixing with the standard hypercharge gauge boson that lead to electromagnetic interactions of the Z , which can produce a collimated e + e \u2212 pair that is misidentified as a single electron-like event in the MiniBooNE detector. If the Z is lighter than the \u03bd 4 , it can be produced by \u03bd 4 decay into a lighter neutrino and it can subsequently decay into a e + e \u2212 pair. this case was proposed in Ref. [136] and shown to be compatible with the energy and angular distributions of the MiniBooNE electron-like events. The parameter space of the model has been recently restricted in Ref. [138] to a region around |U \u00b54 | 2 \u2248 10 \u22128 and m 4 between about 40 and 250 MeV (for m Z = 30 MeV) by considering MINER\u03bdA [140] and CHARM-II [141] neutrino-electron scattering measurements. On the other hand, the authors of Ref. [137] considered a Z that is heavier than the \u03bd 4 and mediates the decay of the \u03bd 4 into a lighter neutrino and a e + e \u2212 pair. This model can fit the energy and angular distributions of the MiniBooNE electron-like events for m 4 between about 100 and 200 MeV, m Z larger than about 1 GeV, and mixings |U \u00b54 | 2 \u2248 10 \u22126 and |U \u03c4 4 | 2 \u2248 10 \u22123 . Such a large value of |U \u03c4 4 | 2 can be probed in atmospheric neutrino experiments, where it generates an excess of neutral-current events in the up-going sample [139].",

While the effective mixing angle in this case corresponds to the product of mixing matrix elements |U e4 | 2 |U \u00b54 | 2 , the observed \u2206m 2 can be almost directly related to that of the \u03bd e disappearance anomalies. In fact, all four results are very well described under the assumption of a (3+1) oscillation framework including one additional sterile neutrino. Compared to the mass eigenstates associated to the active flavors, the preferred \u2206m 2 41 is large and of order 1 eV 2 . At the time of publication of the reactor neutrino anomaly in 2011, the explanation of the anomalies in the (3+1) framework appeared very compelling. The consistent picture resulting from fully compatible \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e mixing parameters was somewhat disturbed by the non-observation of the disappearance of muon neutrinos. As detailed in Sec. 6, an amplitude of comparable level to \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e disappearance would be required to maintain a large enough conversion in \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance channel [143]. Moreover, even before the release of the PLANCK data [144] the cosmological limits on the sum of the neutrino masses disfavored a new mass eigenstate on the eV-scale. On the other hand, the existing limits on N eff were easily compatible with (and at times seemed to favour) a fourth relativistic neutrino state (Sec. 7) [78].",

To improve the probability for neutron captures and for better background discrimination, the LS is sometimes doped with gadolinium (Gd). In this case the gamma energy upon neutron capture is increased to about 8 MeV. Moreover, due to the very high cross section for thermal neutron capture for 155 Gd and 157 Gd, the coincidence time is significantly reduced. For typical Gd-concentrations at the order of 0.1 wt.%, the mean capture time is shortened to less than 30 \u00b5s. For improved event localization 6 Li can be used instead of Gd. The 6 Li isotope decays into a triton and an alpha particle after neutron capture. To test the sterile neutrino hypothesis as origin of the RAA, the general requirements on the detector are low background environment, high energy resolution, precise energy scale knowledge, and a baseline in the 10 m range or even below. Segmentation and modularity also help to improve the sensitivity. Table 1 summarises several of the most important parameters for the different experiments discussed below.",

The rather high statistics of almost 2000 antineutrinos per day in the detector allowed NEOS to confirm the spectral distortion around 5 MeV with high significance. Concerning the search for sterile neutrinos, the measured prompt energy spectrum is compared with the Daya Bay unfolded spectrum [145] as shown in Fig. 13. From an analysis of this spectral ratio, the NEOS collaboration reported an exclusion of the parameter space below 0.1 for sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) in a \u2206m 2 41 region ranging from 0.2 eV 2 to 2.3 eV 2 with a confidence level of 90% [103]. This exclusion area already disfavours some of the best fit points in global analyses. The minimum \u03c7 2 value in a (3+1) hypothesis was found for the pair (sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ), \u2206m 2 41 ) = (0.05, 1.73 eV 2 ). Since the spectra in NEOS and Daya Bay were obtained at different reactors, some spectral modelling is required. The anomalous behavior of the measured shape and its unknown origin might therefore have an impact on the analysis. Overall no strong evidence for (3+1) neutrino oscillations were observed in this experiment. After a longer break the NEOS collaboration restarted data taking using the same detector at the same site. The plan is to cover one full burnup cycle with this new phase-II data. ",

First results with 33 days of reactor ON and 28 days of reactor OFF data are in good agreement with a no-oscillation hypothesis. A significant part of the sterile neutrino oscillation parameter space can be constraint at 95% CL as shown in Fig. 16. The best fit of the RAA is excluded at 2.2\u03c3 CL [152]. The sensitivity so far is statistically limited. In the oscillation analysis of PROSPECT, a global minimum is found for the parameter combination sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) = 0.35 and \u2206m 2 41 = 0.5 eV 2 . With the compact reactor core and the rather short baseline PROSPECT has one of the best prospects concerning the sensitivity to the parameter region at higher mass splittings. Moreover, the PROSPECT collaboration recently published first results on the measured 235 U antineutrino energy spectrum [153]. With 3426 MW-days corresponding to 40.2 days of reactor-ON, the experiment detected 31678 \u00b1 304 (stat.) neutrino-induced IBDs. The spectrum is broadly in reasonable agreement with the Huber prediction, in particular in the 5 MeV region where most LEU reactor experiments observed an event excess. However, due to the limited statistics the spectrum is within uncertainties also consistent with the shape of other experiments like Daya Bay.  The analysis is performed by comparing the spectra recorded at the various distances of each detector section to an averaged spectrum. Compared to the simulation predictions, this averaged spectrum shows an excess at the lowest energy bin (1.5 MeV) and a deficit (about 20%) compared to the model around 3 MeV energy. The experiment reported an oscillation signal with about 3\u03c3 significance at sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) = 0.39 and a rather large mass splitting of \u2206m 2 14 = 7.3 eV 2 . Fig. 17 shows the corresponding L/E behavior. This analysis is based on a data set with 480 days of reactor ON and 278 days of reactor OFF with the reactor switched on and off 58 times. However, the quoted result is in tension with the limits obtained by the other measurements.",

To achieve this goal, a composite scintillator design is applied. The neutrino target is made out of 5 cm cubes of polyvinyl toluene (PVT) scintillator, which are optically isolated by reflective Tyvek wrapping. In the phase 1 there are 10 PVT layers each consisting of 16 x 16 cubes. The energy depositions of annihilation gammas in neighbouring cubes can be used to tag the prompt positron of the IBD interaction. On two faces of each PVT cube there is a 250 \u00b5m thick neutron sensitive layer of 6 LiF:ZnS(Ag). After thermalization in the PVT cube, the IBD neutron can be captured on a 6 Li nucleus in these layers within a coincidence time of about 60 \u00b5s. Most of the produced alpha and triton energy is deposited inside the ZnS(Ag) inorganic scintillator. The time profile of the photon production in the ZnS is much slower ( \u00b5s scale) than the one of PVT signals (ns scale). These characteristic time signatures can be used for effective background discrimination. The IBD efficiency in SoLid was found to be about 30% with a signal to background ratio of 1:3.",

Therefore, the sensitivity will further improve and should cover all of the preferred parameter space suggested by the RAA and Gallium calibration data. From the predicted final sensitivities, very high potential is expected from the DANSS and PROSPECT experiments. DANSS will profit from high statistics samples at different baselines combined with a good signal-to-noise ratio. PROSPECT has the advantage of a much higher energy resolution in their detector segments.",

            "text": "All reactor neutrino experiments so far used the IBD reaction for detection. Currently several running and upcoming experiments investigate the possibility to detect the neutrinos by coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering. In this reaction, the cross-section is about two orders of magnitude higher than the one of the IBD. Therefore, the mass of the detector could be strongly reduced given the energy threshold is low enough. This new approach might open the possibility for a new set of reactor experiments with modular design at very short baselines. They might provide complementary insights on the reactor anomalies, in particular for the high energy part of the antineutrino spectrum.",

            "text": "An alternative way to search for \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e disappearance due to oscillations of MeV-scale neutrino at meter-scale baseline is to apply strong artificial radioactive sources emitting (\u2212) \u03bd e next to (or even inside) large-volume neutrino detectors. Sterile neutrinos of eV mass would cause a deficit in the measured interaction rate of electron-flavor neutrinos. In addition, in case of large neutrino detectors, a smoking gun signature would be the observation of an continuous oscillation pattern across the target volume. This approach is fully complemen-tary to other oscillation experiments searching for sterile neutrinos. Comparing to the very short-baseline reactor experiments (Sec. 4.1), the advantage here is certainly the fact that the neutrinos originate from a single isotope and their energy spectrum is thus less complex. The fact that source experiments can be placed in deep underground laboratories is fundamental for the suppression of cosmogenic background, typically dominant background for shallow reactor experiments. In addition, the irreducible background (neutrons, gammas) is much smaller compared to the environment next to reactors. Furthermore, it is not possible to place large-scale detectors at meter-scale distance from reactors. The typical size of the radioactive sources is smaller with respect to the cores of nuclear reactors and thus the systematics related to the uncertainty about the origin of emitted neutrinos is smaller in source experiments. An obvious disadvantage is the limited neutrino flux compared to nuclear reactors, as well as a limited measurement time due to the short lifetime of some isotopes. Intrinsic is the complexity of the source production, considering very high activity and radio-purity levels that are required. Non-negligible is also the factor of administrative difficulties related to the permissions for transport and usage of the source. Table 2 summarizes the basic properties of the isotopes that have been considered in the search for light sterile neutrinos. Electron-capture decays of 51 Cr and 37 Ar produce sub-MeV mono-energetic \u03bd e 's. Such sources have been actually produced and have been used in the calibration of the radiochemical experiments detecting solar neutrinos [111][112][113], as described in Sec. 3.2. Isotopes decaying via \u03b2 \u2212 process produce\u03bd e with continuous spectra. The 144 Ce- 144 Pr, 106 Ru- 106 Rh, and 90 Sr- 90 Y systems have been identified in [159]. The IsoDAR (Isotopic Decay At Rest) experimental program aims at the application of the very short-lived 8 Li isotope [160][161][162], continuously produced via irradiation of the 7 Li target with neutrons produced by a proton beam impinging on 9 Be target.",

The required total activity of the source was 100-150 kCi, corresponding to order of 10 4 IBD events in 1.5 years of data taking, with an expected antineutrino background of about 6 geoneutrinos and 12 reactor antineutrinos. About 4 kg of CeO 2 were to be pressed into a stainless steel capsule of 170 mm height. With about 0.7% branching ratio, 144 Pr decays to an excited state of 144 Nd, accompanied by the emission of a 2.2 MeV gamma. A 19 cm thick tungsten-alloy shielding, attenuating this gamma by a factor of 10 12 had been already produced at Xiamen Ltd. in China. The total power emitted by the source, a key ingredient in the analysis, was to be measured by the two redundant calorimeters already constructed. Their performance was proven to be better than the required 1% precision for the decay heat emitted by the source.",

The 60 MeV proton beam impinges on a cylindrical 9 Be target (see Fig. 21, left) that is 20 cm in diameter and 20 cm long and produces copious neutrons. These are then moderated and multiplied by a surrounding 5 cm thick layer of D 2 O. Secondary neutrons enter a cylindrical sleeve of solid lithium ( 7 Li enriched to 99.99%), 150 cm long and 200 cm in outer diameter, enveloping the target and D 2 O layer. Fig. 21 shows this geometry as well as the Monte Carlo simulation of the production of about 1500 \u03bd e from 8 Li decay. As suggested in [173], using deuterons instead of protons gives an enhanced \u03bd e rate by a factor 2.7. Fig. 21 (right part) shows the 5\u03c3 exclusion curves of the null-oscillation hypothesis for IsoDAR@KamLAND and IsoDAR@JUNO, assuming five years of data taking [173]. Iso-DAR@JUNO would provide a sensitivity not only covering the reactor anomaly [81] but also the entire short-baseline appearance allowed region [10] at 5\u03c3. This represents a decisive test of the LSND and MiniBooNE appearance signals within all models that are CP T invariant [173].",

At higher energies, the muon neutrino flux becomes increasingly abundant as more and more muons reach the ground instead of decaying in the atmosphere. Due to energy redestribution in the hadronic shower, the spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos is steeper than the spectrum of cosmic rays with a spectral index of \u03a6(\u03bd) \u221d E \u22123. 2.5 \u2022 10 \u22123 eV 2 dominates the oscillations of atmospheric muon neutrinos. At GeV energies, the oscillation length is many hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Oscillations are either studied by long-baseline accelerator neutrino beams (see Sec. 4.4.2) or based on the atmospheric neutrino flux itself, where they are not observed for neutrinos from interactions in the atmosphere above the detector, but only for neutrinos that travel a significant distance through the earth. For distances of the order of the earth radius the variations in neutrino production height become negligible, which has the advantage that the zenith angle under which the neutrino is observed becomes a direct measure of the neutrino propagation distance. A good understanding of the atmospheric neutrino flux is thus required in these two key observables: the energy and the zenith angle distribution.",

Hence in these showers the mesons and muons have more time to decay, enhancing both the neutrino flux as well as the muon-to-electron neutrino abundance towards the horizon. While at energies above \u223c 10 GeV, this effect is symmetric around the horizon, for lower energies this symmetry is broken. This is due to the geomagnetic field: low energy cosmic-ray particles are bent significantly by the geomagnetic field, and only cosmic-ray particles above certain rigidity (i.e. energy-to-charge ratio) can enter into the atmosphere. Together with the magnetic field, this depends on the position in the earth and on the direction of the cosmic-ray particles and hence neutrinos. Furthermore the flux is affected by the density and density variation of the atmosphere which changes the fraction of mesons that interact instead of decaying. Detailed models are therefore required to determine the neutrino flux at each specific location [174]. The sensitivity of atmospheric neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande and IceCube benefits from the fact that the zenith-and energy-dependence of the systematic effects are different from the pattern induced by neutrino oscillations and their results are among the most constraining to the so-called atmospheric mixing angle \u03b8 23 and the atmospheric mass splitting \u2206m 2 32 [179,180].

            "text": "The Super-Kamiokande detector [181] located in the Kamioka mine in Japan consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank filled with 50 kton pure water. More than 11,000 photomultiplier tubes with the largest available diameter of 20 inch monitor this water volume for neutrino interactions. Charged particles with velocities above the Cherenkov threshold are generated in both charged and neutral current interactions of neutrinos. The emitted Cherenkov light is observed under the Cherenkov angle \u03b8 c = arcsin 1 n \u223c 42 \u2022 in water, leading to a characteristic ring-like pattern. Muons generated in charged current interactions of \u03bd \u00b5 's can be well separated from the electromagnetic and hadronic showers generated by charged current interactions of \u03bd e and \u03bd \u03c4 and neutral current interactions: at the energies discussed here, the muons travel in a straight line, so that the light emitted by the muon and its secondaries forms a sharper ring-like structure than for showers in which multiple scattering of the particles creates a more fuzzy ring (Fig. 22). The rock overburden with a height of 1,000 m (corresponding to 2,700 m water equivalent) provides excellent shielding against atmospheric muons and reduces their flux to 6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 cm \u22122 s \u22121 sr \u22121 . To discriminate the atmospheric and radioactive backgrounds (mostly radon), a fiducial volume is defined 2 m inside from the physical walls 4 . For the atmospheric neutrino analysis, events are classified in three categories: fully contained, partially contained and up-going muon-like. The sub-GeV fully contained events with energies from few hundred MeV to about 10 GeV dominate the sample with a rate of \u223c 25 \u00b5Hz per 22.5 kton for muon-like and electron-like events each. While the muon sample reaches a purity of 95% for \u03bd \u00b5 charged current events, the purity of the electron sample is reduced to 89% due to contamination with neutral current events [183]. A different event categorization is used for the multi-GeV fully contained sample which contributes another 20 \u00b5Hz. At a few %, the energy resolution in these fully contained samples is rather good, but the directional resolution is limited by the kinematic angle between neutrino and outgoing lepton and becomes as large as 100 \u2022 for the lowest energies. In contrast, the partially contained events (\u223c 7 \u00b5Hz) and particularly the upgoing events (\u223c 16 \u00b5Hz) are almost exclusively \u03bd \u00b5 charged current induced. While in partially contained events with the interaction vertex inside the fiducial volume the energy resolution is degraded due to outgoing muons leaving the detector, the directional resolution is improved due to the longer muon track. Finally, for upgoing muon events with a vertex outside the detector, only a lower limit can be set by the energy deposited in the detector. On the other hand, due to the much larger energies of 10-1,000 GeV, the directional resolution improves to few degrees. In combination with the propagation baselines which vary from few to 12,800 km for earth-crossing neutrinos, these data samples allow to probe a wide range of L/E values ranging from 1 -10 4 km/GeV, thus covering well the first oscillation maximum of the atmospheric mixing at L/E 500 km/GeV.",

            "text": "The IceCube detector [184] employs the natural glacial ice sheet at the geographic South Pole as a neutrino detection medium. Holes are drilled to a depth of 2,500 m in which a total of 5,160 Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), each containing a 10 inch photomultiplier and readout electronics, are deployed (Fig. 23) in the range between 1450-2450 m. The bulk of the detector consists of 86 strings arranged in a triangular grid with a horizontal spacing of 125 m and a vertical spacing between DOMs of 16.6 m. This sparse instrumen-tation results in an energy threshold of \u223c 100 GeV, but provides an instrumented volume of km 3 10 6 kton. However, this threshold is to high to observe oscillations even for atmospheric neutrinos crossing the full diameter of the earth, with a first \u03bd \u00b5 dissappearence minimum at 25 GeV. In the central part of the detector the eight additional strings of the subarray IceCube-DeepCore [185] reduce the horizontal spacing to 40-50 m. At the same time, the 480 DOMs on these strings are equipped with photomulitpliers featuring a 35% higher quantum efficiency and are spaced at a vertical distance of 6 m. While at trigger level, the resulting effective volume is still \u223c 10 Mt, the very sparse sampling of the emitted Cherenkov light, scattering of the photons in the ice and the huge abundance of atmospheric muon background results in a rather low purity at this level. A series of harsh event selection criteria are required to reject the muon background to below 1% and select well reconstructed events [186]. For the same reason, no direct flavor identification is possible and events are categorized only in track-like when the muon track from a \u03bd \u00b5 charged current interaction can be identified and cascade like for all \u03bd e , \u03bd \u03c4 and neutral current interactions. For track-like events, the neutrino direction can be estimated from the direction of the muon which is well aligned with the neutrino at the energies discussed here. The median neutrino zenith resolution is 12 \u2022 at 10 GeV and 6 \u2022 at 40 GeV. On the other hand, only a rather poor estimate of the direction is possible for electron neutrinos, so that they are neglected in the analysis 5 . At the final selection level, \u03bd \u00b5 charged current events are identified at a rate of 100 \u00b5Hz with a \u03bd e contribution of 18 \u00b5Hz and a \u03bd \u03c4 fraction of 5 \u00b5Hz estimated from simulation in the range from 6 \u2212 56 GeV. The energy resolution, which is mainly based on the length of the muon track emerging from the shower at the neutrino interaction vertex, is about 25% over most of the energy range. While the narrower energy range compared to Super-Kamiokande only allows to probe L/E in the range from 10-2,000 km/GeV, the first muon neutrino dissappearence maximum is still well covered in this range.",

For \u2206m 2 s \u223c 1 eV 2 , the first oscillation minimum is at a value of L/E 1 km/GeV, outside the range covered with high statistics by Super-Kamiokande and IceCube-DeepCore. The signature of this vacuum oscillations-like disappearance is hence only observable in the unresolved regime in a change of the overall flux normalization. Hence sin 2 (\u2206m 2 s L/E) = 0.5 is used in good approximation for \u2206m 2 > 0.1 eV 2 for Super-Kamiokande. The IceCube-DeepCore analysis uses a fixed value of \u2206m 2 s = 1 eV 2 but demonstrates that the result only depends weakly on this choice in the range from 0.1 eV 2 to 10 eV 2 . In both cases no constraint on \u2206m 2 s is possible though. The second effect is caused by the different effective matter potential experienced by sterile and active neutrinos when crossing the Earth. In their propagation, the active neutrinos feel a potential due to neutral current interactions with electrons and nuclei with an additional potential for electron neutrinos due to charged current interactions with the electrons of the Earth's matter (Fig. 4). In contrast, sterile neutrinos have no interactions with the earth matter. This modifies not only the energy but also the amplitude of the oscillation minimum with a strength proportional to the amount of matter along the neutrino trajectory. The effect is therefore most pronounced for neutrinos crossing the Earth's core, i.e. In the presence of a sterile neutrino with coupling to \u03bd \u00b5 (|U \u00b54 | 2 > 0) and \u03bd \u03c4 (|U \u03c4 4 | 2 > 0), the amount of \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance reduces for the most upward-going bins in the tens of GeV region. There is also a small amount of extra disappearance on top of the standard oscillations introduced by the nonzero |U \u00b54 | which is most visible in the slight darkening of the right part of the plot corresponding to the overall \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance effect.",

Note that even in the absence of sterile neutrinos, a distortion of the oscillation pattern in the Earth will be observed due to the charged-current interaction potential only present for electron neutrinos. However, sterile neutrinos modify the pattern and extend it to higher energies (Fig. 24). In both analyses, |U e4 | 2 = 0 is chosen such that the new sterile state does not couple to electrons. This is mostly motivated by the reduced sensitivity to electron neutrino oscillations because of the smaller value of sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) < sin 2 (2\u03b8 23 ), but generally somewhat improves the constraints obtained for the remaining two parameters of the model |U \u00b54 | 2 and |U \u03c4 4 | 2 . Figure 25 shows the resulting constraints on these parameters. We note that in [187] the further no-\u03bd e approximation is made by setting the mixing parameters of the active neutrinos to the electron sin 2 (2\u03b8 12 ) = sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) = 0. This reduces the oscillations to an effective twoflavor system, allowing to solve the oscillation probabilities analytically even in the presence of a matter potential. This also eliminates the normal \u03bd e matter effects in the absence of a sterile neutrino (compare Fig. 2(b) in [187]). Because \u03bd e are present at a few percent level, matching the overall normalization to the observed data thus introduces a systematic bias towards lower measured |U \u00b54 | 2 . In contrast, in [188] the neutrino oscillation probabilities are determined by numerically solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation using the GLoBES software [189,190] and a 12-layer approximation of the earth density model [191]. This more realistic treatment results in a modified shape of the exclusion contour, in particular at |U \u03c4 4 | 2 = 0. We also note that choosing the inverted hierarchy (\u2206m 2 32 < 0) reduces the sensitivity for the analysis in [188] as it moves the matter effect for the active flavors from neutrinos to antineutrinos. While IceCube can not distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos and their atmospheric flux is roughly equivalent, the cross-section for neutrinos is larger by about a factor of two, thus enhancing the event rate and sensitivity to the matter effects.

In the study presented in [197], a sample of atmospheric neutrinos passing an event selection developed for a search for diffuse astrophysical muon neutrinos [198] is used. At energies ranging approxmitely from 320 GeV to 20 TeV, the muons emerging from charged current \u03bd \u00b5 interactions travel many hundred meters in the glacial ice. As these muons are essentially co-linear with the neutrino direction due to the kinematic boost the directional resolution reaches below 1 \u2022 at the highest energies. This not only yields and excellent path length estimate for the oscillation, but also makes the sample essentially background free by restriciting the search to upward going tracks, eliminating the abundant flux of downward going atmospheric muons. Because the events are not contained within the detector, the energy has to be estimated from stochastic losses [199] which become more frequent with higher energies. The resulting muon energy resolution is approximately \u03c3(log 10 E \u00b5 / GeV) \u223c 0.5.",

In addition to detector effects such as the efficiency of the DOMs, the modelling of scattering and absorption in the ice and particularly in the drill holes, uncertainties in the atmospheric flux model also have to be taken into account. Using the MCEq cascade equation technique [200] variations in the primary spectral index,\u03bd/\u03bd ratio and \u03c0/K production ratio, hadronic interactions and atmospheric models all can be propagated to uncertaintes in the flux at affordable computational effort. Figure 27 shows the result from an analysis [197] using 20,145 reconstructed up-going muon events collected in one year of operation of the full IceCube detector. Strong exlusion limits are obtained in the range of \u2206m 2 s = 0.02 \u2212 0.3 eV 2 corresponding to the energy range with the highest statistics in the sample. As due to the nearly maximal mixing of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 , oscillations of \u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd s lead to additional disappearance, the conservative choice of sin 2 (2\u03b8 34 ) = 0 was assumed in this study.",

The beryllium target is embedded within a pulsed electromagnet (the \"horn\") that produces a toroidal magnetic field to focus positive secondary particles and defocus negative secondary particles emerging from proton-beryllium interactions to obtain a \u03bd \u00b5 -enhanced beam. The polarity of the horn current can be changed to produce an antineutrino-enhanced beam as was done in the MiniBooNE experiment. The secondary particles decay in a 50 m long decay tunnel followed by an absorber, and a beam of neutrinos with an average energy of 800 MeV remains.

The benefit of this technique is its superior imaging capability providing mm-resolution views of the interaction that allow to track even short secondary particles such as protons emerging from the nucleus [208][209][210]. In this particular application of a \u03bd e appearance search, the advantage is that the discrimination of signatures produced by a single electron from a \u03bd e interaction against the signature of photons produced for example in the decay of secondary \u03c0 0 s is superior to the Cherenkov technique used in the MiniBooNE experiment (see Fig. 30).",

The near detector will help to constrain these with its flux and cross section measurements. Cosmic rays are another background since the SBN experiments are operating on the surface and the LArTPC technology requires a rather long readout window of order ms. All detectors use external cosmic tagging systems to reject cosmic events. The plots show a stacked histogram of simulated signal and backgrounds for an idealized version of each detector and illustrate the expected event distribution assuming an oscillation signal of \u2206m 2 = 0.43 eV 2 and sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e = 0.013. The expected signal from a sterile neutrino (white) increases with the baseline and is largest in the ICARUS T600 detector. The background of electromagnetic signatures from \u03b3s produced in \u03bd \u00b5 interactions (brown) is greatly reduced compared to the MiniBooNE experiment by the LArTPC technology. The main background are electromagnetic showers from interactions of \u03bd e and\u03bd e intrinsic to the beam (green). Note, that the plots are taken from the SBN design proposal [202] and serve illustrative purposes. They will be superseeded once fully developed calibration and event reconstruction is available for all three detectors.  Figure 30: Left: this LArTPC event display from MicroBooNE shows the interaction of a \u03bd \u00b5 producing a \u03c0 0 [211]. The distinct signature of the \u03c0 0 is the gap between the start point of the showers (indicated by the cones) from the interaction vertex caused by the neutral and unseen \u03b3s produced in the decay of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The color represents a measure of the deposited charge. Right: demonstration of e/\u03b3 separation in LArTPCs by the ArgoNeuT experiment [212]. ArgoNeuT was a smaller-size experiment advancing the LArTPC technology. Electrons and \u03b3s are categorized by an observed gap between the interaction vertex and the start of the electromagnetic shower in data and simulation. For both sub-samples, the energy loss distribution is shown. Photon showers are characterized by twice as much energy loss than an electron induced shower due to the shower starting with pair production (\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ).",

In the charged-current \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance channel, a hypothetical oscillation due to \u2206m 2 41 would be observed on top of the three-flavor oscillation. The observed neutral current rate is unaffected by three-flavor oscillations but sensitive to sterile oscillations. The effect of sterile oscillation strongly depends on the mass of the sterile neutrino. For light sterile neutrinos with \u2206m 2 41 < 1 eV 2 , the effects are seen in the far detector. For larger masses, the oscillations become more rapid and start to be seen in the near detector. MINOS/MINOS+ published several iterations of the sterile neutrino analysis with MINOS and MINOS+ neutrino and antineutrino beam data [216]. Exclusion limits are shown in Fig. 35 and are discussed in the context of global \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance fits in Sec. 6.2. The NO\u03bdA sterile neutrino analysis utilizes the neutral current channel with improved event reconstruction and identification, and background rejection compared to MINOS. The results are consistent with three-flavor oscillations and no hints on sterile neutrinos are found [216]. Future analyses with additional data will increase the sensitivity of the analysis.",

            "text": "CP violation is not observable in short-baseline experiments, because the effective oscillation probabilities in Eq. (10) depend on the absolute values of the fourth column of the mixing matrix. This is due to the fact that in short-baseline experiments oscillations are driven by only one squared-mass difference, \u2206m 2 41 , since the source-detector distance is too short for the emergence of the oscillations driven by the other two squared-mass differences \u2206m 2 31 (the atmospheric squared-mass difference) and \u2206m 2 21 (the solar squared-mass difference). Hence, the effective short-baseline oscillation probabilities in Eq. (10) have a two-flavor form without CP violation effects. Since CP violation is a property of mixing only for more than two flavors, it can be observed only when the oscillations driven by more than one \u2206m 2 are operative and appear in their interference. This is what can occur in long-baseline experiments, which are sensitive to standard three-flavor CP violation through the interference of the oscillations driven by \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 21 , and can be sensitive to the new CP-violation phases in four-flavor mixing through the interference of the oscillations driven by \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 41 , even if the oscillations due to \u2206m 2 41 are averaged. The exact oscillation probabilities in long-baseline experiments are very complicated and can be calculated numerically, taking into account also the matter effects for neutrino beams propagating below the Earth surface. However, one can understand the physics involved by considering the following approximation of the long-baseline probability of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e transitions, that is the main observable sensitive to CP violation in long-baseline experiments.

As a result, a fourth mass eigentstate, with a mass significantly different to the three light mass eigenstates, will imprint itself as a kink-like signature in the beta decay spectrum, see Fig. 6.",

The WGTS beam tube is situated in a magnetic field, which is oriented in beam direction. All \u03b2-electrons that are emitted in the forward direction are guided along the field lines out of the WGTS and towards the spectrometers. The spectrometers work as MAC-E filters allowing only those electrons with enough kinetic energy to be transmitted.

The small decrease in sensitivity at sin 2 (2\u03b8) = 5 \u2022 10 \u22122 stems from the specific choice of the measurement time distribution assumed for this study. A future atomic tritium experiment with increased statistics (10 19 beta decays), and with a differential energy measurement with a resolution of 1 eV (Full-Width-Half-Maximum) could, from a statistical point-of-view, reach the sensitivity depicted with the yellow dashed line. The green solid line depicts the sensitivity the ECHo-1M could reach. A possible upgrade to higher statistics (10 18 decays) would increase the sensitivity accordingly (red line) [236]. mixing angle of sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) < 10 \u22122 could be reached (details of this preliminary result, will be subject of a different publication). Figure 32 shows the sensitivity, KATRIN could reach with a 3-years data taking phase, based on the design parameters [232]. Recent studies have shown that an elevated background can strongly affect the KATRIN sensitivity.

This measurement will be highly complementary to a MAC-E-Filter result, as the systematic uncertainties will be completely different. In Project-8 major systematics arise from inhomogeneities and inaccurate knowledge of the magnetic field. It will be a challenge to keep these uncertainties at an acceptable level, especially when scaling the experiment to a large-volume trap. The expected sensitivity of the final phase of Project-8 is expected to exceed the KATRIN sensitivity both for neutrino mass and sterile neutrinos. Figure 32 shows the statistical sensitivity of a future atomic tritium experiment, with an energy resolution of 1 eV and a total statistics of 10 19 decays.",

            "text": "The study of short-baseline electron neutrino disappearance due to active-sterile neutrino mixing was originally motivated by the reactor and Gallium anomalies described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. However, the discovery of the 5 MeV excess in the reactor neutrino spectra of the RENO [102], Double Chooz [100], and Daya Bay [101] experiments with respect to the theoretical predictions based on the Huber-Muller fluxes [87,88] raised strong doubts on the Huber-Muller fluxes and their estimated uncertainties (see Refs. [95,247]). Since the reactor antineutrino anomaly [81] follows from the comparison of the experimental reactor neutrino rates with the theoretical predictions based on the Huber-Muller fluxes, an increase of the uncertainties of the Huber-Muller fluxes lowers the statistical significance of the anomaly. Lacking a reliable indication in favor of the reactor antineutrino anomaly, the Gallium neutrino anomaly cannot be considered as a sufficient indication in favor of shortbaseline electron neutrino disappearance, because it is based on only four data points with large uncertainties. Therefore, at present, in the study of short-baseline electron neutrino disappearance we can rely with some confidence only on data that do not depend on an absolute rate measurements. Indeed, the new experiments are designed for the investigation of the oscillations by measuring the neutrino interaction rate at different distances. Comparing the rates or, better, the energy spectra measured at different distances from a source gives model independent information on neutrino oscillations or other distance-dependent phenomena. At present, there are several reactor neutrino experiments operating with this method, as described in Section 4.1.",

The combined NEOS/Daya Bay and DANSS allowed region is confronted in Fig 33(b)  [76] with the regions preferred at 2 and 3 \u03c3 by the reactor antineutrino anomaly and the Gallium neutrino anomaly. There is a tension at 2\u03c3 that indicates that the reactor and Gallium anomalies have been somewhat overestimated. Figure 34(a) [143] shows the regions in the |U e4 | 2 -\u2206m 2 41 plane that are allowed by the fit presented in Ref. [143] of all reactor neutrino data, including the NEOS/Daya Bay and DANSS spectral ratios, with and without fixing the neutrino fluxes at the Huber-Mueller prediction. The best-fit allowed region around |U e4 | 2 0.01 and \u2206m 2 41 1.3 eV 2 is similar to that in Fig. 33 and it is almost independent of the assumption on the neutrino fluxes (free or fixed). This happens because the NEOS/Daya Bay and DANSS spectral ratios dominate the fit.

The blue shaded regions are allowed by the fit of all reactor data with free fluxes (with the best-fit point indicated by a white star). The magenta lines enclose the regions allowed by a fit of all reactor data with the Huber-Mueller fluxes (with the best-fit point indicated by a magenta star). The light-shaded areas are allowed by the \"old\" reactor data (i.e. without NEOS, Daya Bay and DANSS) with fixed Huber-Mueller (light orange) and free (light green) fluxes. Also shown are the Daya Bay [157] (black) and NEOS/Daya Bay [103] (green) exclusion curves. The allowed regions and exclusion curves in panel (b) are at 95% (dark shaded regions and thick curves) and 99% (light shaded regions and thin curves) CL. The blue and red shaded regions are allowed, respectively, by the combined fit of all reactor and all (\u2212) \u03bd e disappearance data (with the best-fit point indicated by a black star). Also shown are the solar exclusion curves (black dashed). the Super-Kamiokande+DeepCore+IceCube (SK+DC+IC) exclusion curves (green solid), and the \u03bd e -12 C (C12) scattering exclusion curves (dark red dash-dotted). The analysis of Gallium data yielded the 95% allowed yellow region and the 99% CL yellow exclusion curve.",

[76,143]), we conclude that there is an intriguing model-independent indication in favor of short-baseline (\u2212) \u03bd e disapperance due to active sterile mixing with the parameters in Eq. (23). Let us however emphasize that this indication depends crucially on the agreement of the NEOS/Daya Bay and DANSS spectral ratios and needs to be checked in other experiments, as the ongoing Stereo [150], PROSPECT [152], SoLid [257], and Neutrino-4 [258] reactor experiments. \u03bd e oscillations found more than 20 years ago in the LSND experiment [121,262] and more recently in the MiniBooNE experiment [122,124,263] (see Section 3.3).

The appearance-disappearance tension is clear from the fact that these allowed regions lie in the area that is excluded by the  \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance data. The appearance-disappearance tension has always been present in the analyses of shortbaseline neutrino oscillation data [10,13,14,[20][21][22]26,28,30,[36][37][38]91,143,255,[264][265][266][267] with alternating strength since the discovery of the LSND anomaly in 1995 [262]. The tension was increased in 2016 [91] by the NEOS [103] limits on |U e4 | 2 and by the MINOS [269] and IceCube [197] bounds on |U \u00b54 | 2 . The confirmation of a small value of |U e4 | 2 by the DANSS experiment [146] and the very stringent MINOS&MINOS+ [216] limits on |U \u00b54 | 2 led to a further dramatic increase of the tension in 2018 [76,143], that is quantified by an appearance-disappearance parameter goodness-of-fit [270] smaller than 10 \u22126 [14,143]. This result disfavors the neutrino oscillation explanation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies. However, since it has been obtained with a combined analysis of many experimental data in the specific framework of (3+1) active-sterile mixing, it cannot be considered to be a definitive conclusion on the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, that need to be checked directly. This will be done in the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program [271] and in the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS 2 ) experiment [272].",

There are small controversies on the modelling of systematic errors in helium and deuterium measurements and on theoretical errors in BBN codes. For this work, we first computed bounds on N eff based on helium data from [273] and deuterium data from [274], and then checked their dependence on various observational and theoretical uncertainties described in [144].

Finally, the combined CMB+BBN bounds presented in eq. (77) of [144] raise the exclusion level to 7\u03c3 or even 8\u03c3. One may think that CMB bounds on N eff are not as model-independent as BBN bounds, and could easily be evaded in extended cosmological model. This is however far from obvious. References [276,277] fitted Planck data with many additional cosmological parameters at the same time, accounting for neutrino masses, a dark energy equation of state, a running of the primordial spectrum index, primordial tensor modes, etc. They still find N eff = 2.93 +0.51 It is worth noticing that direct measurement of the Hubble parameter from superNO\u03bdAe luminosity are in significant tension with other cosmological data. If the tension is not caused by underestimated systematics in one of the data sets, the current standard cosmological model is ruled out at 4.4\u03c3 [279]. When this tension first emerged around 2011, it raised hopes that a higher value of N eff could reconcile the data sets, because N eff and H 0 have partially counter-acting effects on the time of radiation-to-matter equality and on some characteristics of the CMB temperature spectrum. Thus, N eff 4 became slightly prefered over N eff 3 at some point (see e.g. [78]). However, all recent studies agree that such a simple solution does not work when more recent and precise CMB data are taken into account: it cannot solve the tension without raising other ones, at least when the \u039bCDM model is extended in a straightforward way with a free N eff plus active and/or sterile neutrino masses [144]. It remains nevertheless possible that more complicated extensions with more subtle physical ingredients do resolve the tension. In principle, they could be compatible with a high N eff , and maybe with a population of sterile neutrinos. We will actually review one example of such models [49] in Sec. 7.3.",

Fig. 36 presents the joint bounds on these parameters obtained by the Planck collaboration when using only CMB data [144]. The density of points reflects the posterior probability on these two parameters (marginalized over all other model parameters). The black dashed lines correspond to fixed values of the particle mass for a model of little relevance to sterile neutrinos (namely, early decoupled thermal relics). As expected, the upper bound on m eff \u03bd,sterile gets stronger when N eff increases, since the mass effect is weighted by \u2206N 4 . No bound on the particle mass can be inferred from this analysis, since for an arbitrary small number density and small \u2206N 4 (i.e. N eff \u2212\u2192 3) some arbitrarily large physical masses are compatible with CMB data. Models with too high masses are irrelevant in the context of light sterile neutrino scenarios. The region close to the N eff = 3 axis rather corresponds to models of warm or cold dark matter, whose mass is unconstrained by CMB data. Thus this region can be excluded when computing sterile neutrino parameter bounds. In the Planck analysis this is achieved by cutting the grey shaded region, which would correspond to a particle mass above a threshold of about 30 eV for the Dodelson-Widrow scenario. After removing this area, the individual constraints on each of the two parameters read",

Indeed, removing CMB lensing data and adding instead BAO data, which is blind to neutrino free-streaming, one gets approximately the same constraints [144].

Such an asymmetry would be very large compared to the one in the baryon sector, but a priori, still small enough to comply with BBN and CMB constraints on the chemical potential of active neutrinos [282,283]. The authors of [74] find that this mechanism can be efficient enough to reduce the density of \u03bd 4 neutrinos down to \u2206N 4 0.1 when assuming (\u2206m 2 41 , sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 )) (1, 0.1). However, reference [79] revisited this model taking into account the possibility of different primordial asymmetries in each (active and sterile) flavor, and studying their evolution with time due to neutrino oscillations in the early universe. They stress that when the primordial asymmetries are sufficient to prevent sterile neutrino thermalization, the chemical potential of electron neutrinos at the BBN epoch has to be significantly different from zero, in such a way that primordial abundances could be in tension with observations.

To avoid this, one may assume that reheating after inflation takes place at an extremely low temperature T RH , of the same order of magnitude as the neutrino decoupling temperature. Then, neutrinos can never reach thermal equilibrium with photons. This solution has been proposed in the context of light sterile neutrinos in [284,285]. For instance, with T RH 3 MeV, each neutrino would be produced at the level of \u2206N eff \u223c 3 4 [286], leaving room for four species summing up to N eff \u223c 3. It is also possible to reduce the density of active and sterile neutrinos relative to that of photons by invoking some entropy production taking place in the small lapse of time between neutrino decoupling and BBN [287]. In both cases, N eff can be adjusted to about three, but should not get much smaller in order to comply with the lower bound from BBN and CMB. Then, the problem is that in these models, active-sterile neutrino oscillations with sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) 0.1 should be efficient and lead to an equal share of N eff 3 between the four neutrino states, and thus to \u2206N 4 We see that this category of models is only marginally consistent with current cosmological bounds. Finally, \u03bd 4 neutrinos could be coupled through \"secret interactions\" to some (vector or scalar) boson belonging to a dark sector. Through finite temperature effects, the interaction generates an effective potential that suppresses active-sterile mixing in the early universe and may achieve \u2206N 4 < 0.3 [50,[288][289][290][291].",

This could be problematic, especially in the case of interactions between a massive gauge boson and the sterile neutrino flavor state [292][293][294][295]. In this scenario, at neutrino decoupling, N eff is still close to 3 and distributed equally among active neutrinos. Then, if active-sterile neutrino oscillations become efficient, N eff gets redistributed almost equally between the four mass eigenstates. In absence of secret interactions, this would take place with a constant N eff 3. However, the efficient interactions mediated by the gauge boson would force this redistribution to take place in thermal equilibrium between all neutrino mass states, since they all contain at least a small sterile component [292]. Then entropy conservation would lead to an overall reduction of the temperature of the neutrino sector and bring N eff close to 2.7, which is still compatible with BBN bounds. With \u2206N 4 2.7/4 = 0.675, the effect of a mass m 4 \u223c O(1 eV) on CMB and LSS observables is marginally compatible with CMB bounds: approximating the impact of this specific model in terms of the parametrization of Sec. 7.2, one gets m eff \u03bd,sterile 0.675 eV for m 4 1 eV, close to the 2\u03c3 CMB upper bound. However, in this model, the relic neutrinos are not free-streaming like in \u039bCDM: due to secret interactions, they behave at least partially as a relativistic fluid. CMB data disfavor the combined effect of N eff < 3 and of self-interacting relativistic relics at a significant level [292][293][294][295].",

            "text": "The scenario of [49,289,296] assumes instead a non-standard interaction between the mainly sterile mass state \u03bd 4 and a pseudoscalar field in a dark sector with a mass m \u03c6 m 4 . Assuming a pseudoscalar rather than a scalar boson allows to evade fifth force bounds. Like in the previous model, an effective potential suppresses active-sterile oscillations in the early universe, helping to pass BBN tests. There is a range in which the interaction is strong enough for such effects to take place and weak enough to avoid bounds from superNO\u03bdAe energy loss [297]. Interestingly, this model differs from the one with heavy gauge boson mediators at the level of the late time cosmological evolution. Indeed, a significant population of light pseudoscalars is produced in the late universe, when the secret interaction is efficient. At times relevant for CMB and LSS, N eff remains typically in the range from 3 to 3.5, and accounts for two populations of relativistic relics beyond photons: first, free-streaming active neutrinos, and second, a self-coupled fluid of \u03bd 4 and \u03c6 particles. Initially, at temperatures T > m 4 , the second fluid is composed of both relativistic \u03bd 4 neutrinos and relativistic pseudoscalars. Then \u03bd 4 neutrinos annihilate into lighter pseudoscalar particles, and one is left with a fluid of very light relics \u03c6 with a mass m \u03c6 fulfilling bounds on m eff \u03bd,sterile . The fact that part of the relativistic species are self-interacting at CMB times is not in contradiction with Planck data, because of a partial cancellation between the impact on CMB observables of a high N eff > 3 and of self interactions (due to modified \"neutrino drag\" and \"gravity boost\" effects, see Sec 2.3.3). This cancellation works better when H 0 is also high. Thus this model could help to resolve the tension between CMB data and direct measurements of H 0 [49]. The dedicated cosmological analysis presented in the last reference shows that this scenario is compatible with recent cosmological data. The collisional nature of the extra relativistic degrees of freedom during the CMB epoch offers an opportunity to test it specifically with more precise CMB experiments.",

Very similar numbers could be obtained by combining a satellite like LiteBird [303] covering large scales with a ground-based experiment like CMB-S4 [304] covering small scales. With such numbers, and assuming the existence of a fourth neutrino mass state with m 4 \u223c O(1 eV), one could accurately test most of the models summarised in Sec. 7.3. For instance, scenarios with an (ad hoc) low reheating temperature or entropy production could be confirmed or ruled out, since they predict m eff \u03bd,sterile \u223c O(1 eV); secret interactions mediated by gauge bosons would be probed for the same reason, and also because they tend to achieve N eff < 3. Future CMB data will also have an enhanced sensitivity to the assumption that all or part of relativistic relics could be self-interacting [299].

Since 2011, a variety of new results has led to greater experimental sensitivity for both the \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance channels: reactor antineutrino experiments (Sec. 4.1) have been able to rule out a large fraction of the parameter space originally favoured by reactor and gallium anomalies, although current results point towards a new best-fit region at similar \u2206m 2 41 but smaller amplitude. Also the limits on the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance amplitude have grown significantly tighter (Sec. 4.3 and Sec. 4.4.2). Contrariwise, recent results from MiniBooNE even increase the significance of the anomalous \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance signature (Sec. 3.3). Thus, it seems that the current inconsistency between (negative) disappearance and (positive) appearance data will only be resolved when the reactor searches will have reached their full sensitivity and the Fermilab SBN program will provide an independent and more sensitive test of the appearance anomaly (Sec. 4.4.1). A disappearance search based on radioactive \u03bd e sources would provide a cross-check of the gallium anomaly and CPT invariance (Sec. 4.2).",

For a value of m 4 \u2248 2 eV, the expected sensitivity of KATRIN corresponds to a matrix element of |U e4 | 2 = 0.1 (90 % CL), while for larger masses the sensitivity increases significantly. Hence, the KATRIN data will provide information relevant to the best-fit values of the original anomaly. Future tritium-and holmium-based experiments, such as extensions of KATRIN, Project-8, ECHo, and Holmes, are planned to surpass this sensitivity, being able to test the current best-fit values for |U e4 | 2 . However, more than a decade will pass before these results become available.",

It should be noted, though, that the restrictions posed by this standard interpretation of cosmological data can be somewhat alleviated if additional physics mechanisms are added, e.g. by avoiding the thermalization of the sterile neutrino state in the early Universe (Sec. 7.3).",

However, a much more complete picture is expected to emerge only a few years from now: the running reactor/source experiments and the SBN program at FNAL are very likely to deliver a definite answer on the occurrence of active-sterile oscillations in the 1-eV 2 range. Absolute mass experiments and cosmological observations will provide a complementary set of constraints, limiting the mass and number of light neutrino species. Therefore, a definite conclusion on the existence of an eV-scale sterile neutrino seems well within range!",
