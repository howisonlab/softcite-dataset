Only the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9(782)\u03b7 cross section was measured by the BaBar Collaboration [1] with a relatively low statistical accuracy using \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay, and by the SND Collaboration [2] (with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay). The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 cross section contributes a not negligible value (up to 15% of the total hadronic cross section in some energy range) to the calculations of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment [3], and a detailed study of the production dynamics can further improve the accuracy of these calculations as well as our understanding of the spectroscopy of light mesons.",

Its tracking system consists of a cylindrical drift chamber (DC) [6] and double-layer multiwire proportional Z-chamber, both also used for a trigger, and both inside a thin (0.2 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1.3 T. The tracking system allows to detect charged tracks with a minimum polar angle about 0.5 radians relative to the beam axis (about 90% of 4\u03c0 ). The barrel liquid-xenon (LXe) calorimeter with a 5.4 X 0 thickness has fine electrode structure, providing a 1-2 mm spatial resolution for photons [7], and shares the cryostat vacuum volume with the superconducting solenoid. The barrel CsI-crystal calorimeter is placed outside the LXe calorimeter, and increases the total thickness to 13.5 X 0 . The endcap BGO calorimeter with a thickness of 13.4 X 0 is placed inside the solenoid [8]. Our combined calorimeter allows to detect photons with a minimum polar angle down to 0.25 radians relative to the beam axis (about 98% of 4\u03c0 ). The luminosity is measured using events of Bhabha scattering at large angles with about 1% accuracy [9].",

First, we look for one photon pair with the invariant mass closest to the \u03c0 0 mass inside the \u00b155 MeV/c 2 (about \u00b13.5 standard deviations) window, and we use the \u03c0 0 mass as an additional fifth constraint in the fit (5C fit) for this photon pair. No additional constraints are applied to the second photon pair. The covariance matrices for charged tracks and photons are used in the fit and provide a \u03c7 2 value for each event. A large fraction of the event candidates has more than four photons: we test all possible combinations, and two photon pairs with the smallest \u03c7 2 value are retained for further analysis. As a result of the fit, we obtain improved values of the momenta, energies and angles for all particles. Each event is also subject to the 4C fit under a e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 hypothesis: all photon pairs are tested to get the best \u03c7 2 value, and a requirement \u03c7 2 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 > 40 suppresses the background from the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 by a factor of 10-20 to a negligible level with a 1.5% loss of the signal events.

The parameters of the \u03c9(1420) (denoted below as \u03c9 ) are not well determined [16], and in our first fit we fix them at average values, similarly to Ref. [2]. A relative phase is fixed at \u03c0 to describe the asymmetry of the peak in the measured cross section.

A clear signal associated with a 0 (980)is seen in both energy ranges: while events inFig. 4(b)are below the nominal a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) threshold, a 0 (980) is still visible due to the large width of the \u03c1(770).Histograms cumulatively show MC-simulated contributions from the expected \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 (shaded, see discussion in Sec. 5), \u03c9(782)\u03b7 (cross hatched), \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 (hatched), and a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) (open) intermediate states.

The obtained number of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 events in the E c.m. = 1600-1800 MeV energy range exceeded that expected from the sum of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9(782)\u03b7 (33%), \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 (7%), and a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) (29%) reactions. At each E c.m. energy we subtract events obtained for the \u03c9, \u03c6, a 0 signals from the total number of events obtained from the \u03b7 signal of Fig. 1(b), and show the difference vs E c.m. in Fig. 6(a). A resonant structure is observed around E c.m. = 1700 MeV. The difference (about 31%) can be, for example, explained by the presence of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9(1650) \u2192 \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03b7\u03c0 reaction. In this case an additional signal from the \u03c1(770) should be seen in two-pion masses. For the E c.m. = 1600-1800 MeV energy range we show the background-subtracted \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution (three entries per event) in Fig. 5(b). Histograms cumulatively show the MC-simulated contributions from the \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 (shaded), \u03c9(782)\u03b7 (cross hatched), \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 (hatched), and a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) (open) final states. The dashed histogram in Fig. 5(b) presents simulation when the phase-space model is used instead of \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 , indicating some data excess around the \u03c1(770) mass. Our data do not contradict to the presence of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9(1650) \u2192 \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03b7\u03c0 reaction, but an additional \u03c1(770) contribution cannot be quantitatively extracted from the mass distributions with reasonable accuracy. Note that the \u03c1(770) signal from the a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) intermediate state is also diluted below 1750 GeV due to limited phase space. Moreover, the expected \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03b7\u03c0 decay chain and a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) both contain a relatively broad \u03c1(770) resonance, and can interfere at the amplitude level. To examine an interference effect we sum two equal amplitudes of the above intermediate states at the primary generator level, and perform simulation with positive and negative relative signs. Fig. 6(b) shows the background-subtracted experimental \u03c0 +\u22120 \u03b7 (three entries per event) invariant mass distribution (points) with the excluded contribution from the \u03c9(782)\u03b7 and \u03c6(1020)\u03b7 intermediate states (using MC-simulation). Short-dashed, solid, and longdashed histograms show a simulated signal from the sum of the a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) and \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 intermediate states in case of constructive, no-interference, and destructive interference of the amplitudes, respectively. The shaded histogram shows a contribution of the \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 intermediate state only. When we fit the a 0 (980) signal peak as described above, the number of events changes by \u00b150% from the value with no interference. Because of that, we should add at least a 50% model-dependent systematic error to the number of a 0 (980)\u03c1(770) (and hence to \u03c1(1450, 1700)\u03c0 ) events in the E c.m. = 1650-1750 MeV energy range, where overlap is the largest.",
