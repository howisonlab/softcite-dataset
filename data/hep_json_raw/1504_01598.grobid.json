Drell-Yan measurements with high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam and transversely polarized NH3 target have been initiated by a pilot-run in the October 2014 and will be followed by 140 days of data taking in 2015. In the past twelve years COMPASS experiment performed series of SIDIS measurements with high energy muon beam and transversely polarized deuteron and proton targets. Results obtained for Sivers effect and other target transverse spin dependent and unpolarized azimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS serve as an important input for general understanding of spin-structure of the nucleon and are being used in numerous theoretical and phenomenological studies being carried out in the field of transvers-spin physics. Measurement of the Sivers and all other azimuthal effects in polarized Drell-Yan at COMPASS will reveal another side of the spin-puzzle providing a link between SIDIS and Drell-Yan branches. This will be a unique possibility to test universality and keyfeatures of transverse momentum dependent distribution functions (TMD PDFs) using essentially same experimental setup and exploring same kinematic domain. In this review main physics aspects of future COMPASS polarized Drell-Yan measurement of azimuthal transverse spin asymmetries will be presented, giving a particular emphasis on the link with very recent COMPASS results obtained for SIDIS transverse spin asymmetries from four \"Drell-Yan\" Q 2 -ranges.",

Here the most promising for DY-studies is the so-called \"high mass\" range which is expected to be free from background and corresponds to the valence-quark region where the Drell-Yan asymmetries are expected to reach their largest values. 4,6 On the right plot COMPASS SIDIS Q 2 > 1(GeV /c) 2 and Drell-Yan \"high mass\" overlapping distributions are demonstrated. SIDIS TSAs extracted from all four aforementioned \"Q 2 -ranges\" 10 together with COMPASS recent results for multi-differential analysis 11 will serve not only for future SIDIS-DY comparison, but, exploring two-dimensional x:Q 2 -behaviour of the asymmetries, they can be used also as a better input for TMD-evolution studies and related SIDIS-DY predictions. [20][21][22] Results for Sivers asymmetry are presented in Fig. 3. A clear positive signal is observed for positive hadrons (growing with x, z and p T ). For negative hadrons some hints of a negative amplitude can be seen at lowest Q 2 -range for intermediate z values while at relatively large x and Q 2 there are indication for a positive signal. Comparing points from same x-bins, but different Q 2 -ranges one can see  that within statistical accuracy there is no clear and strong Q 2 -dependence for the effect. Nevertheless, decreasing with Q 2 trend can be noted in some bins which has been confirmed also by the recent more detailed multidimensional analysis. 11 It is interesting to mention that for planned Drell-Yan measurements Sivers asymmetry in the \"high mass\"-range is expected to have approximately same statistical accuracy as it's SIDIS-analogue extracted from COMPASS proton-2010 data (\u2248 1%). This should be enough to address the Sivers function \"sign-change\" challenge and possibly also to study kinematical dependences of the effect in several bins. [20][21][22] Even if Sivers effect in Drell-Yan is a flagship measurement for COMPASS-II, other TSAs and their links with SIDIS \"analogues\" from Table. 1 are also very important for general TMD PDF-studies. In the Fig. 4 mean values for all eight SIDIS-TSAs are quoted as measured in four Drell-Yan Q 2 -ranges.",

Using COMPASS proton 2010 transvers data all eight SIDIS TSAs were extracted from four Q 2 -ranges selected for the COMPASS Drell-Yan program. These results combined with future polarized Drell-Yan data from COM-PASS will give a unique opportunity to access TMD PDFs via two processes and test their universality and key features sticking to the same x:Q 2 kinematical range.",
