Precision measurements of the parameters of the CKM matrix are important to investigate new sources of CP violation. The study of the time-dependent decay rates of B 0 (B 0 ) \u2192 D * \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 provides a method for extracting sin(2\u03c6 1 +\u03c6 3 ) [2], where \u03c6 1 and \u03c6 3 [3] are angles of the CKM Unitarity Triangle as defined in [4]. As shown in Fig. 1, these decays can be mediated by both Cabibbo-favored (CF) and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) diagrams, whose amplitudes are proportional to V * cb V ud and V * ub V cd , respectively, where V ij are the CKM matrix elements and have a relative weak phase difference \u03c6 3 .",
