The replacement of the light lepton by the higher-mass \u03c4 leads to an increased sensitivity to new physics (NP) effects. In particular, models with charged Higgs bosons [5,6], whose couplings are proportional to mass and thus more pronounced for \u03c4 leptons, predict measurable deviations of the branching fraction and kinematic distributions from SM expectations. The measurement ofB \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 is challenging because the \u03c4 must be reconstructed from its decay products that include one or more neutrinos.",

Subsequent measurements by BaBar and Belle [8][9][10] reported branching fractions above-yet consistent with-the SM predictions. In 2012, a significant excess over the SM expectation was reported by BaBar [11] that suggested the presence of NP; this called for an independent confirmation. Interestingly, the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) of type II, which might explain a deviation from the SM expectation in a (semi)tauonic B decay [5], is incompatible with this result.

Since the low-and high-M 2 miss regions are dominated by different backgrounds, the data sample is split at M 2 miss = 0.85 GeV 2 /c 4 and the subsamples are fit simultaneously. In the low-M 2 miss region, which is dominated by the normalization mode, we fit the M 2 miss distribution; in the high M 2 miss region, where the background with multiple missing particles contributes, we fit the neural-network output distribution.

The PDFs of M 2 miss are represented by smoothed histograms and are constructed by applying a smoothing algorithm [30] to the respective MC distributions. Each bifurcated-Gaussian PDF in o NB is parameterized by the mean, left width and right width, which are determined by an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the MC distribution. In the fit, each component has a total yield, defined in Table I, with partial yields in the lower-and upper-M 2 miss regions that are fixed MC-determined fractions of the total yield.",

Figure 8 shows the measured background-subtracted and efficiency-corrected q 2 distributions for the SM and the NP point.

This can happen by either missing particles in the event or misassigning particles to the wrong B meson. This background occurs in all samples and, in the D * \u2212 samples, includes combinations of a correctly reconstructed D meson and an incorrect D * primary daughter. The M 2 miss distribution is very broad and extends to the highest values.The fake D ( * ) yield is estimated separately for each D ( * ) decay mode. A sideband region is defined in the distribution of the invariant mass M D (the D * -D mass difference \u2206M D * D ) by excluding twice the signal-region width on both sides of the nominal mass (mass difference) and a \u00b160 MeV/c 2 window around the D * peak position for the D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 channel. Multiplying the sideband yield in the real data by the yield ratio in MC of the fake D ( * ) component and sideband provides an estimate for the fake D ( * ) yield in each D ( * ) decay mode; these are summed to obtain the total yield in each of the four data samples.D * * background: This component contains candidates that originate fromB \u2192 D * * \u2212\u03bd (\u03bd \u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 ) decays.The higher-excitation D states decay typically to a D or D * meson plus one pion (although more pions are possible) so the final state here has a properly identified lepton, a properly reconstructed D ( * ) meson, and (at least) one pion that might be lost or absorbed into B tag . If the pion is missed, this process mimics the tau signal and exhibits a similar M 2 miss distribution. The yields of this background and the tau signal are comparable. In contrast to the other background components, it is not possible to constrain the yield from MC since the properties ofB \u2192 D * * \u2212\u03bd and D * * decays are not known reliably. Thus, its yield is a free parameter in the fit.fake lepton: This component contains events with a misidentified lepton candidate; the track is usually a kaon or pion from the tag side or from B \u2192 DK or D\u03c0 decays. This component also includesB \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 events with a misidentified pion from a hadronic \u03c4 decay. Since lepton misidentification is far less probable than D ( * ) misreconstruction, a D ( * ) \u2212 event in which both are misidentified is classified in the fake D ( * ) component. The fake lepton background is a broad structure in M 2 miss that appears in all four data samples; the fixed and relatively low yield is estimated accurately from MC.D s decay: This component arises from the decay chain B \u2192 D ( * ) D \u2212 s with D \u2212 s \u2192 \u2212\u03bd (\u03bd \u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 ) and so has a final state that mimics the tau signal.
