One B meson in the event is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode while the other, on the signal side, is partially reconstructed from a charged lepton and either a D + or D 0 meson in a total of 23 hadronic decay modes. The isospinaveraged branching fraction of the decay B \u2192 D \u03bd is found to be B(B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 + \u03bd ) = (2.31 \u00b1 0.03(stat) \u00b1 0.11(syst))%. Analyzing the differential decay rate as a function of the hadronic recoil with the parameterization of Caprini, Lellouch and Neubert and using the form-factor prediction G(1) = 1.0541 \u00b1 0.0083 calculated by FNAL/MILC, we obtain \u03b7EW|V cb | = (40.12 \u00b1 1.34) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where \u03b7EW is the electroweak correction factor. Alternatively, assuming the model-independent form-factor parameterization of Boyd, Grinstein and Lebed and using lattice QCD data from the FNAL/MILC and HPQCD collaborations, we find \u03b7EW|V cb | = (41.10 \u00b1 1.14) \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

            "text": "The magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa [1,2] matrix element |V cb | can be determined from inclusive semileptonic decays to charm final states B \u2192 X c \u03bd [3] and from exclusive decays B \u2192 D * \u03bd [4,5] and B \u2192 D \u03bd [6]. Exclusive and inclusive measurements differ by about two to three standard deviations, where the current world averages determined by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group [7] yield |V cb | B\u2192D * \u03bd = (38.94 \u00b1 0.76) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and |V cb | B\u2192Xc \u03bd = (42.46 \u00b1 0.88) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The inclusive and exclusive (from B \u2192 D * \u03bd ) determinations of |V cb | are thus known with a precision of about 2%. Determinations of |V cb | with the decay B \u2192 D \u03bd are currently less precise with a world average of |V cb | B\u2192D \u03bd = (39.45 \u00b1 1.67) \u00d7 10 \u22123 ; the 4% error is dominated by the experimental uncertainty. The main motivation of our study is to improve the determination of |V cb | from B \u2192 D \u03bd and thereby clarify the experimental knowledge of |V cb |.",

An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). Electron candidates are identified using the ratio of the energy detected in the ECL to the track momentum, the ECL shower shape, position matching between track and ECL cluster, the energy loss in the CDC, and the response of the ACC. Muons are identified based on their penetration range and transverse scattering in the KLM detector. In the momentum region relevant to this analysis, charged leptons are identified with an efficiency of about 90% and the probability to misidentify a pion as an electron (muon) is 0.25% (1.4%) [17,18]. Charged kaons and pions are identified by a combination of the energy loss in the CDC, the Cherenkov light in the ACC, and the time of flight in the TOF. Further details on the Belle detector and reconstruction procedures are given in Ref. [19].",

For a given systematic error component, we vary one or several parameters in the MC simulation according to a Gaussian distribution with a width corresponding to the systematic uncertainty under study. This altered MC sample is then used to repeat the entire analysis procedure, resulting in an updated value of \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w. Repeating this procedure 1000 times, we obtain a distribution of \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w values corresponding to this specific systematic error component. The distribution is fitted with a Gaussian function and the width \u03c3 i of the Gaussian function is taken as the estimate of the contribution of this error component to the total systematic uncertainty. The corresponding correlation \u03c1 i,j between \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w and \u2206\u0393 j /\u2206w is calculated as where the average indicated by the brackets is taken over the toy MC sample. To reduce the effect of outliers, toy MC events where one value of \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w lies outside of the interval \u00b13\u03c3 i are removed. The elements of the covariance matrix are then calculated as \u03c1 i,j \u03c3 i \u03c3 j . The full systematic error matrix is obtained by adding the covariance matrices corresponding to the individual error components linearly. This is equivalent to the quadratic addition of the systematic error components of \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w. The individual systematic error components are described in the following. Tag correction: This error component is estimated in two steps: we apply all the corrections to the MC mentioned in Sect. II A and vary these within their respective uncertainties. This results in systematic uncertainties in the 480 tag correction coefficients introduced in Sect. II B. Finally, we propagate the uncertainties in the tag correction coefficients to the values of \u2206\u0393 i /\u2206w. The statistical uncertainties in the tag corrections are varied independently while the systematic errors on the coefficients are conservatively assumed to be 100% correlated.",

We use lattice data obtained by the FNAL/MILC and HPQCD collaborations [15,32]. Both LQCD calculations are dominated by their systematic errors.

Denoting the covariance matrix of the HPQCD a-parameters by Cov(a), the error matrix of the form-factor values becomes M Cov(a) M T . The HPQCD results in terms of the f + and f 0 form factors at w = 1, 1.08 and 1.16, together with their correlation coefficients, are given in Table VI. Table VII shows the result of the BGL fit to experimental and LQCD data (FNAL/MILC and HPQCD) for different truncation orders of the series (N = 2, 3, 4). To implement the unitarity bound (Eq. (12)), we constrain the cubic and quartic coefficients in Eq. (8) to 0 \u00b1 1 in the fits with N = 3 and N = 4 by adding measurement points of a +,i\u22653 and a 0,i\u22653 to the \u03c7 2 . This follows the method in Ref. [15] and results in a constant number of degrees of freedom. For N \u2265 3, the fit stabilizes and we get a reasonable goodness of fit. We thus choose this truncation order as our preferred fit. The fit result in terms of \u2206\u0393/\u2206w and f +,0 is shown for N = 3 in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. Our baseline result for \u03b7 EW |V cb | for the combined fit to experimental and lattice QCD data is thus (41.10 \u00b1 1.14) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . This is slightly more precise than the fit result using the CLN form-factor parameterization (2.8% vs. 3.3%) due to the additional input from LQCD. The additional lattice points are also the dominant cause of differences in the resulting values. We have verified the stability of this \u03b7 EW |V cb | value by repeating the fit with different sets of lattice QCD data (Table VIII) and the differences between the results are well below one standard deviation.
