            "text": "The study of B meson decays to \u03c1\u03c1 final states provides the most powerful constraint to date for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi- [1][2][3]. Most of the physics information is provided by the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03c1 \u2212 as measured at the e + e \u2212 colliders at the \u03d2(4S) resonance [4,5], 1 for which the dominant decay amplitude, involving the emission of a W boson only (tree), exhibits a phase difference that can be interpreted as the sum of the CKM angles \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1 in the Standard Model. The subleading amplitude associated with the exchange of a W boson and a quark (penguin) must be determined in order to interpret the electroweak phase difference in terms of the angle \u03b1. This is realised by means of an isospin analysis involving the companion modes B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03c1 0 [6,7] and B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 [8,9]. 2 In particular, the smallness of the amplitude of the latter leads to a better constraint on \u03b1.",

The software trigger requires a two-, three-or fourtrack secondary vertex with large transverse momenta of charged particles and a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one charged particle should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and is required to be inconsistent with originating from any primary interaction. A multivariate algorithm [17] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

The (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) candidates must have transverse momentum larger than 600 MeV/c, with at least one charged decay product with p T > 1000 MeV/c. The two (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) pairs are then combined to form a B 0 candidate with a good vertex quality and transverse momentum larger than 2500 MeV/c. The invariant mass of each pair of opposite-charge pions forming the B 0 candidate is required to be in the range 300-1100 MeV/c 2 . The identification of the final-state particles (PID) is performed with dedicated neural-networks-based discriminating variables that combine information from the RICH detectors and other properties of the event [14]. The combinatorial background is further suppressed with multivariate discriminators based on a boosted decision tree algorithm (BDT) [18,19]. The BDT is trained with simulated B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 (where \u03c1 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) events as signal sample and candidates reconstructed with fourbody mass in excess of 5420 MeV/c 2 as background sample. The discriminating variables are based on the kinematics of the B decay candidate (B p T and the minimum p T of the two \u03c1 0 candidates) and on geometrical vertex measurements (quality of the B candidate vertex, impact parameter significances of the daughters, B flight distance significance and B pointing to the primary vertex). The optimal thresholds for the BDT and PID discriminating variables are determined simultaneously by means of a frequentist estimator for which no hypothesis on the signal yield is assumed [20]. The B 0 meson candidates are accepted in the mass range 5050-5500 MeV/c 2 .",
