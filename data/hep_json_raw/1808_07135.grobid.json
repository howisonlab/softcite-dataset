The dataset consists of proton-proton interactions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 . The tau leptons are reconstructed in both leptonic and hadronic decay channels. An upper limit on the production cross-section multiplied by the branching fraction at 95% confidence level is set and ranges from 22 pb for a boson mass of 45 GeV/c 2 to 4 pb for a mass of 195 GeV/c 2 .

            "text": "The LHCb detector probes the forward rapidity region which is only partially covered by the other LHC experiments, and triggers on particles with low transverse momenta ( p T ), allowing the experiment to explore relatively small boson masses. In this paper a search for CLFV decays into a muon and a tau lepton of a Higgs-like boson with a mass ranging from 45 to 195 GeV/c 2 is presented, using proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The Higgs-like boson is assumed to be produced by gluon-fusion, similarly to the main production mechanism of the SM Higgs boson at LHC [36]. 1 The analysis is separated into four channels depending on the final state of the \u03c4 lepton decay: (i) single muon \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd \u03c4 , (ii) single electron \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e \u2212 \u03bd e \u03bd \u03c4 , (iii) single charged hadron \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 0 )\u03bd \u03c4 , and (iv) three charged hadrons \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 )\u03bd \u03c4 . They are denoted as \u03c4 \u03bc , \u03c4 e , \u03c4 h1 , and \u03c4 h3 respectively. The main sources of background are Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decays, 2 heavy flavour production from QCD processes (\"QCD\" in the following) and electroweak boson production accompanied by jets (\"V j\"). This analysis utilizes reconstruction techniques and results obtained from the Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 measurement by the LHCb collaboration [37].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors (PS), an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are identified by a system composed of five stations of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

The background from the V j processes is suppressed by up to 60% for the \u03bc\u03c4 h1 channel by requiring A p T < 0.4 (0.5) in the L-selection (Sselection), because of the large p T imbalance between the highp T muon from the vector boson and a hadron from a jet. For the \u03bc\u03c4 e channel, the worse momentum resolution increases the average A p T value, hence a softer selection A p T < 0.6 is used to preserve efficiency. On the contrary, for the \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc channel, a tighter cut is applied to suppress the dominant background from Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays. By requiring A p T > 0.3 (0.4) in the L-selection and C-selection (Hselection), such background is reduced by 80%, while the signal decreases to 70%.",

These efficiencies are obtained from simulated samples and data for each decay channel and selection set, following the methods developed for the Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 measurement [37]. The acceptance obtained from the Powheg-Box generator is identical for the \u03bc\u03c4 e , \u03bc\u03c4 h3 , and \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc channels, varying from 1.0% for m H = 195 GeV/c 2 to 3.2% for m H = 75 GeV/c 2 . The reconstruction efficiency, which is the product of contributions from trigger, tracking, and particle identification, is in the range 40-70%, but only about 15% in the case of the \u03bc\u03c4 h3 channel because of the limited tracking efficiency for the lowmomentum hadrons. With the exception of the \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc channel, the selection efficiency is 18-30% in the L-selection, and 24-49% in the C-selection and H-selection. In the case of the \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc channel, the tighter selection on the muon p T and impact parameter reduces the selection efficiency to 10-15%. The systematic uncertainties are summarised in Table 3. The uncertainty on the acceptance receives contributions from the gluon PDF uncertainty, as well as from factorization and renormalisation scales. The uncertainties on the reconstruction and selection efficiencies are estimated from simulation and are calibrated using data as described in Ref. [37]. The uncertainty associated with the invariant-mass shape is handled by selecting the weakest expected limits among the different choices of distribution (kernel estimation and histograms with different bin widths are used). The uncertainties on the integrated luminosity and acceptance are fully The signal yield is determined from a simultaneous extended likelihood fit of the binned invariant-mass distributions of the \u03bc\u03c4 candidates. The distributions for signal are obtained from simulation, while distributions of the different background sources are obtained using the method described in Sect. 4.
