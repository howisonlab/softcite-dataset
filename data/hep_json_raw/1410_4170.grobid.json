Using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, the world's best sensitivity to CP violation in this decay is obtained. The data are found to be consistent with the hypothesis of CP symmetry with a p-value of (2.6 \u00b1 0.5)%.",

The interference of these amplitudes may give rise to a violation of the charge-parity symmetry (CP violation), which may be observed as an asymmetry in the total rates, or in the distribution of events over the Dalitz plot. Contributions from particles that are not described in the Standard Model (SM) and participate in the loops of the penguin amplitude can enhance the O (10 \u22123 ) CP violation effects expected within the SM [1]. Therefore CP violation in D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays provides sensitivity to such non-SM physics.",

A visualisation method is also used that allows identification of regions of the Dalitz plot in which CP violation is observed.

One is an asymmetry that may arise from background events and the other is due to particle detection asymmetries that could vary across phase space. These effects are tested using the Cabibbo-favoured decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 as a control mode. This channel is affected by kaon detection asymmetries, which are known to be larger than pion detection asymmetries and thus should serve as a conservative test. The data sample is split into eight subsets, each of which contains approximately the same amount of data as the signal sample. The energy test yields p-values between 3% and 74%, which is consistent with the assumption that detection asymmetries are below the current level of sensitivity. A further test is conducted by splitting the control mode data sample by the polarity of the spectrometer dipole magnet, which yields two large approximately equal-sized samples. The resulting p-values of 8% and 15% show no evidence of sizable biases due to detector asymmetries.",

The data sample has been split according to various criteria to test the stability of the results. Analyses of sub-samples with opposite magnet polarity, with different trigger configurations, and with fiducial selection requirements removing areas of high local asymmetry of the tagging soft pion from the D * + decay all show good consistency of the results.  In summary, a search for time-integrated CP violation in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 is performed using a novel unbinned model-independent technique.

Enhanced event densities in the phase-space corners originate from the \u03c1(770) resonances. resolved and merged samples. The BDT uses the variables related to the kinematic and topological properties of the signal decays, as well as the \u03c0 0 quality. It is trained separately for the resolved and merged data categories. The most discriminating variables in the resolved sample arep T (\u03c0 + s ), p T (D 0 ) and p T (\u03c0 0 ), while in the merged sample these are p T (\u03c0 + s ), p T (D 0 ) and the D 0 \u03c7 2 IP .The optimal value of the BDT discriminant is determined by estimating the D * + signal significance for various requirements on the BDT output. It retains approximately 75% (90%) of the resolved (merged) signal events while removing 90% (55%) of the background.Fig. 1shows the m distributions for the selected data set for events with resolved and merged \u03c0 0 candidates. The signal shapes, fitted inFig. 1with a sum of three Gaussian functions, significantly differ between both samples reflecting the different \u03c0 0 momentum resolutions. The lower momentum resolution of the merged \u03c0 0 mesons relative to the resolved \u03c0 0 mesons makes the core part of the merged signal distribution wider, while the low-p T \u03c0 0 mesons contributing to the resolved signal enlarge its tail component. The background shape is fitted using a secondorder polynomial multiplied by\u221a1 \u2212 m \u03c0 + / m. The final signal sample is selected requiring | m \u2212 145.4| < 1.8 MeV/c 2 , which corresponds to roughly four times the effective m resolution. The effective resolution is similar for both resolved and merged \u03c0 0 samples when averaging the narrow and broad components of the peak. This gives 416 \u00d7 10 3 resolved and 247 \u00d7 10 3 merged signal candidates with a purity of 82% and 91%, respectively. The Dalitz plot of the final signal sample is shown inFig. 2. The smaller number of candidates in the low m 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) region compared with the high m 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) region is due to acceptance effects related to the \u03c0 0 reconstruction as discussed in Section 5.",

These samples show a distribution of p-values consistent with the absence of any asymmetry. Further tests using a binned approach[13]  confirm this conclusion. These are carried out on the m sideband data sample as well as on background samples obtained using the sPlot technique based on the m fits inFig. 1. Both approaches show no indication of a background asymmetry.
