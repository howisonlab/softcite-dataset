The most critical backgrounds are modeled in a data-driven way. Hence, this analysis is straightforward, robust and has little model dependence. In the second approach, maximum precision using multivariate techniques is aimed for. First, the signal to background discrimination is optimized by exploiting the full event characteristics predicted by the SM. Secondly, systematic uncertainties are constrained by simultaneously analysing regions with substantial signal content and regions with negligible signal. As this approach is highly complex, two independent analyses have been conducted. After checking that the results of the three analyses are consistent with each other all three results are combined using the best linear unbiased estimator, BLUE [5], to get a slightly improved final result.",

This b-tagging requirement reduces the background from W+light events strongly and after this cut W+bb background is one of the most important backgrounds.

To increase the separation power in the signal region four variables that have some ability to separate between top quark pair and tW production are combined in a BDT. Those variables are H T , defined as the scalar sum of the leptons, jet, and missing transverse energy, the transverse momentum of the reconstructed tW-system, the p t of the leading jet, and the azimuthal angle between the missing transverse energy vector and the closest lepton.
