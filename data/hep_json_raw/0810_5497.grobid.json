Measurements of this process are important for reducing the uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements. No evidence for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay has been found and a 90% Confidence Level lower limit on the half-life of this process is derived. From this an upper limit can be set on the effective Majorana neutrino mass using the most recent nuclear matrix elements (NME) calculations.",

The source foils are composed of almost 10 kg of enriched \u03b2\u03b2 isotopes, listed in Table 1. Observation of the \u03b2\u03b2 decay is accomplished by fully reconstructing the tracks of the two electrons and measuring their energy. A tracking chamber containing 6180 open drift cells, operating in the Geiger mode, provides a vertex resolution of about 1 cm and a 25 G magnetic field is used to curve the tracks for charge identification. A calorimeter consisting of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks with photomultiplier readout gives an energy resolution of 14 -17%/ E (MeV) FWHM. A time resolution of 250 ps allows excellent suppression of the external background due to electrons crossing the detector. The detector is capable of identifying e \u2212 , e + , \u03b3 and \u03b1 particles and allows good discrimination between signal and background events.

New preliminary results based on higher statistics than used previously are presented here for the three isotopes, 48 Ca, 96 Zr and 150 Nd . The measurement of the 96 Zr half-life was performed using the data collected for 925 days. A total of 678 events was selected, with an expectation of 328 background events. The largest background contribution is due to the internal 40 K contamination of the sample. The distributions of the sum of the energies of the two electrons and their angular separation are shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating good agreement between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 efficiency is estimated to be 7.6%. The measured half-life is T  The measurement of the 48 Ca half-life was performed using the data collected for 943 days. A total of 133 events was selected, with 17 background events expected. The two-electron energy sum distribution and single-electron energy spectrum are presented in Fig. 2. The 48 Ca sample is known to be contaminated with 90 Sr (T 1/2 =28.79 y, Q \u03b2 =0.546 MeV). Its daughter 90 Y (T 1/2 =3.19 h, Q \u03b2 =2.282 MeV) is the major background source in this case. An activity of approximately 1700 mBq/kg was measured for 90 Y using single-electron events. Both 90 Sr and 90 Y are essentially pure \u03b2 \u2212 emitters and imitate \u03b2\u03b2 events through M\u00f6ller scattering. To suppress this background contribution, events with the energy sum greater than 1.5 MeV and cos(\u0398 ee ) < 0 are selected.

Since no excess is observed at the tail of the distribution for 96 Zr, see Fig. 1 (left), nor for 48 Ca, Fig. 2 (left), limits are set on the neutrinoless double beta decay T 0\u03bd 1/2 using the CLs method [4]. A lower half-life limit is translated into an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass m \u03bd (see Eq. 1). The following results are obtained using the NME values from [5,6] for 96 Zr and from [7] for 48 Ca: T 0\u03bd 1/2 ( 96 Zr) > 8.6\u202210 21 y (90% C.L.), m \u03bd < 7.4 -20.1 eV and T 0\u03bd 1/2 ( 48 Ca) > 1.3 \u2022 10 22 y (90% C.L.), m \u03bd < 29.7 eV. Similarly a limit has been set for m \u03bd for 150 Nd. It is complicated by whether the deformation of the nucleus is taken into account. The limit has been calculated for both scenarios: T 0\u03bd 1/2 ( 150 Nd) > 1.8 \u2022 10 22 y (90% C.L.) with m \u03bd < 1.7 -2.4 eV using QRPA model (no deformation) [8] and m \u03bd < 4.8 -7.6 eV using SO(3) model (with deformation) [9].",
