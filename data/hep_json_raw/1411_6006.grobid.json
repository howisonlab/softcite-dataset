Disappearing tracks are identified as those with little or no associated calorimeter energy deposits and with missing hits in the outer layers of the tracker. The search uses proton-proton collision data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 . The results of the search are interpreted in the context of the anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) model. The number of observed events is in agreement with the background expectation, and limits are set on the cross section of direct electroweak chargino production in terms of the chargino mass and mean proper lifetime. At 95% confidence level, AMSB models with a chargino mass less than 260 GeV, corresponding to a mean proper lifetime of 0.2 ns, are excluded.",

A disappearing track can be produced in beyond the standard model (BSM) scenarios by a charged particle whose decay products are undetected. This occurs because the decay products are either too low in momentum to be reconstructed or neutral (and weakly interacting) such that they do not interact with the tracker material or deposit significant energy in the calorimeters.",

            "text": "There are many BSM scenarios that produce particles that manifest themselves as disappearing tracks [1][2][3][4][5]. One example is anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) [6,7], which predicts a particle mass spectrum that has a small mass splitting between the lightest chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ). The chargino can then decay to a neutralino and a pion, \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 \u03c0 \u00b1 . The phase space for this decay is limited by the small chargino-neutralino mass splitting. As a consequence, the chargino has a significant lifetime, and the daughter pion has momentum of \u2248100 MeV, typically too low for its track to be reconstructed. For charginos that decay inside the tracker volume, this results in a disappearing track. We benchmark our search in terms of its sensitivity to the chargino mass and chargino-neutralino mass splitting (or equivalently, the chargino mean proper lifetime, \u03c4 ) in AMSB. Constraints are also placed on the chargino mass and mean proper lifetime for direct electroweak chargino-chargino and chargino-neutralino production.",

Such a trajectory has no missing outer hits, but it does have one expected hit that is not recorded. The penalty for missing hits before the last recorded hit is greater than for those missing after the last hit. As a result, the reconstructed track is instead identified as a trajectory that stops before the layer with the glue joint and has multiple missing outer hits.

A disappearing track is first required to have N outer \u2265 3. Tracks from the potential signal are generally missing several outer hits, provided their lifetime is such that they decay within the tracker volume. To remove SM sources of tracks with missing outer hits, we additionally require that the associated calorimeter energy E calo of a disappearing track be less than 10 GeV, much smaller than the minimum p T of 50 GeV. Since the decay products of the chargino are too low in momentum to be reconstructed or weakly interacting, they would not deposit significant energy in the calorimeters. We compute E calo as the sum of the ECAL and HCAL clusters within \u2206R < 0.5 of the direction of the track.",

In the simulation, the probability of an event to contain a fake track that has large transverse momentum and is isolated does not depend on the underlying physics process of the event.

We measure P fake as the probability of an event in the combined Z \u2192 control sample to contain a track that passes the disappearing-track selection.

The next-to-leading-order cross sections for these processes, and their uncertainties, are taken from refs. [33,34]. The limits are calculated with the CL S technique [35,36], using the LHC-type CL S method [37]. This method uses a test statistic based on a profile likelihood ratio [38] and treats nuisance parameters in a frequentist context. Nuisance parameters for the systematic uncertainties in the integrated luminosity and in the signal efficiency are constrained with log-normal distributions. There are two types of nuisance parameters for the uncertainties in the background estimates, and they are specified separately for each of the four background contributions. Those that result from the limited size of a sample are constrained with gamma distributions, while those that are associated with the relative disagreement between data and simulation in a control region have log-normal constraints.

            "text": "To allow the interpretation of the results of this search in the context of other new physics models, the signal efficiency is parameterized in terms of the four-momenta and decay positions of the generated BSM particles. This allows the signal efficiency to be approximated without performing a full simulation of the CMS detector. In this approximation, the signal efficiency is factorized as = b t , where b is the probability of an event to pass the basic selection and t is the probability for that event to contain at least one disappearing track. The efficiency to pass the basic selection b depends mostly on the p T of the BSM system, which is approximately equal to / E T . The efficiency of the basic selection as a function of the p T of the chargino-chargino or chargino-neutralino system p T ( \u03c7 \u03c7) is shown in table 7. To calculate the probability t that an event contains a disappearing track, it is necessary to first identify charged particles that pass the following track preselection criteria: p T > 50 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.2, and a decay position within the tracker volume, i.e., with a longitudinal distance to the interaction point of less than 280 cm and a transverse decay distance in the laboratory frame L xy of less than 110 cm. For long-lived charged particles JHEP01 (2015)096that meet the track preselection criteria, the efficiency to pass the disappearing-track selection depends mostly on L xy , as given in table 8. Each of the long-lived BSM particles that pass the preselection should be considered, weighted by its disappearing-track efficiency from table 8, to determine whether the event contains at least one disappearing track. This parameterization of the efficiency is valid under the assumptions that the long-lived BSM particles are isolated and that their decay products deposit little or no energy in the calorimeters. For the benchmark signal samples used in this analysis, the efficiency approximation agrees with the full simulation efficiencies given in table 2 within 10% for charginos with c\u03c4 between 10 and 1000 cm. The expected number of signal events N for a new physics process is the product of the signal efficiency , the cross section \u03c3, and the integrated luminosity L, N = \u03c3L. By comparing such a prediction with the estimated background of 1.4 \u00b1 1.2 events and the observation of two events in this search, constraints on other models can be set.",
