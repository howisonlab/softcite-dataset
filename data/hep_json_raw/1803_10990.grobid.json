Different decay rates between heavy-flavoured hadrons and their antiparticles are possible if there is interference between two or more quark-level transitions with different phases. The corresponding violation of CP symmetry was first observed in neutral kaon decays [3]. In B decays, CP violation was first observed in the interference between a decay with and without mixing [4,5] and later also directly in the decays of B 0 mesons [6,7].",
