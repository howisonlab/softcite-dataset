The K 0 S and \u039b particles are reconstructed via their V0 decay topology allowing their identification up to high transverse momenta. The corresponding baryon/meson ratios as a function of transverse momentum are extracted for Pb-Pb collisions in centrality bins and in the transverse momentum range from 1 to 6 GeV/c. They are also compared with those measured in pp events at the LHC energies of 0.9 and 7 TeV as well as in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 62.4 and 200 GeV from RHIC.",

            "text": "One of the most interesting results obtained at RHIC in Au-Au collisions was the observation that the baryon (anti-baryon) production at intermediate transverse momenta becomes comparable to that of mesons [1,2]. The topological decay reconstruction of K 0 S and \u039b provides a unique opportunity to extend the baryon and meson identification to much larger transverse momenta than would be possible using conventional particle identification methods. Measurement performed by the STAR Collaboration (see, for example, [1,3]), showed that the baryon/meson ratio reaches its maximum at p T \u223c 2.5 GeV/c and starts decreasing at higher momenta. The maximum value of the \u039b/K 0 S ratio in central collisions was found to exceed unity. The question of why, in nucleus-nucleus collisions, baryons at intermediate p T appear to be more easily produced than mesons is still open. Possible explanations involve interplays between soft and hard mechanisms of particle production (also at the partonic level) like those discussed, for example, in Ref. [4]. The evolution of the baryon/meson ratio with collision energy may yield additional information about this \"baryon anomaly\".",

The preliminary STAR data points [3] shown in this figure are multiplied by the\u039b/\u039b = 0.8 factor calculated from the data reported in [7] (to account for the non-unity of the anti-baryon/baryon ratio at RHIC) and subtracted a 10 % feed-down correction quoted in [1]. A comparison between the maximum values of (anti-)baryon/meson ratios measured by ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and those obtained by STAR in Au-Au events at \u221a s NN = 62.4 and 200 GeV is presented in Fig. 2 (left). The Au-Au points at 62.4 GeV are plotted as they are published in [8]. To compare the STAR measurements at 200 GeV with the ALICE results, we multiply the STAR values from [9] by the same\u039b/\u039b factor and apply the same feed-down correction as mentioned above.
