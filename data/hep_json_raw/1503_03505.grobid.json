Forward baryon production is one of the crucial points to understand the development of cosmic-ray showers. We report the neutron-energy spectra for LHC \u221a s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with the pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 ranging from 8.81 to 8.99, from 8.99 to 9.22, and from 10.76 to infinity. The measured energy spectra obtained from the two independent calorimeters of Arm1 and Arm2 show the same characteristic feature before unfolding the detector responses. We unfolded the measured spectra by using the multidimensional unfolding method based on Bayesian theory, and the unfolded spectra were compared with current hadronic-interaction models. The QGSJET II-03 model predicts a high neutron production rate at the highest pseudo-rapidity range similar to our results, and the DPMJET 3.04 model describes our results well at the lower pseudo-rapidity ranges. However, no model perfectly explains the experimental results over the entire pseudo-rapidity range. The experimental data indicate a more abundant neutron production rate relative to the photon production than any model predictions studied here.",

This lack of data results in a large uncertainty in the interpretation of the energy and chemical composition of UHECRs. Forward baryons play a very important role in the development of cosmic-ray showers. If forward baryons carry more collision energy, cosmic-ray showers develop much deeper in the atmosphere, and vice versa. However, in the energy range of UHECRs, the predictions by current models differ significantly among themselves.",

The excess of muons at ground level is reported as one of the problems in the cosmic-ray shower observations. The number of muons observed by the surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) [1] is higher than the number expected based on the energy determined by the fluorescence detectors even if a heavy primary mass is assumed [2]. It is suggested that the number of (anti) baryons generated in the forward region is strongly related to the number of muons observed by PAO at the ground [3]. Therefore, baryon production in the very forward region is quite important to understand cosmic-ray showers.",

Two independent detectors named Arm1 and Arm2 were installed in the detector installation slots of the Target Neutral Absorbers (TAN) located 140 m away from the interaction point 1 (IP1). Because charged particles are swept away by the D1 bending magnets, LHCf can measure only neutral particles in the very forward region of the LHC (pseudo-rapidity |\u03b7| > 8.4). Both detectors have two different sampling calorimeters with 44 radiation lengths (1.6 hadron-interaction lengths) of tungsten plates and 16 layers of sampling scintillators [5]. Four layers of position sensors (SciFi in Arm1 and silicon micro-strip sensors in Arm2) can measure the hit position transverse to the beam direction. The transverse dimensions of the calorimeters are 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm and 40 mm \u00d7 40 mm in Arm1, and 25 mm \u00d7 25 mm and 32 mm \u00d7 32 mm in Arm2. The cross sections of the calorimeters viewed from IP1 are shown in Fig. 1. The calorimeter with the smaller (larger) dimensions in each Arm is referred to as the 'small (large) tower' hereafter. The small towers covered the zero degree emission angle of the neutral particles as indicated by stars in Fig. 1. The details of the detector performance during the 2009-2010 proton-proton collisions are reported in [6].",

To estimate the photon contamination, the templates for photons and hadrons were independently scaled to reproduce the experimental results (referred to as Method A). The open circles in Fig. 2 represent the fitting result with Method A. Neutron selection criteria, as indicated in Fig. 2, were chosen to maximize \u00d7 P . To cope with energy dependence, determinations of the PID threshold and correction factors, P and , were performed in eight different energy ranges according to reconstructed energy. After correcting the PID efficiency and purity, we obtained the production rate of neutrons as a function of obtained energy that was determined from the total deposited energy in the calorimeter and from the identity of the particle. Details of the event recon-struction for neutrons are summarized in [7]. About 0.3 million neutron-like events passed the PID selection for each arm.",

L is the integrated luminosity corresponding to the data set. The cross sections are summarized in Table 5. Fig. 7 shows the combined Arm1 and Arm2 spectra together with the model predictions. The experimental results indicate the highest neutron production rate compared with the MC models at the most forward rapidity. The QGSJET II-03 model predicts a neutron production rate similar to the experimental results in the largest rapidity range. However, the DP-MJET 3.04 model predicts neutron production rates better in the smaller rapidity ranges. These tendencies were already found in the spectra before unfolding, and they are not artifacts of unfolding.",

The neutron energy spectra were analyzed in three different rapidity regions. The results obtained from the two independent calorimeters of Arm1 and Arm2 are consistent with each other. The measured spectra were combined and unfolded by using a two-dimensional unfolding method based on Bayesian theory. Unavoidable contamination from non-neutron hadrons was not corrected in this analysis. According to the models, about 0-6% of other hadrons are included and this fraction and the energy dependence are model-dependent.",

The results of previous experiments were consistent with Feynman x (x F ) scaling and do not depend on the collision energy. To accurately extrapolate the hadronic-interaction models to the high-energy range (independently of whether or not the x F scaling in the neutron production is still relevant at energies in the TeV range) is also an important issue.
