            "text": "It is demonstrated that detection of putative particles such as paraphotons and axions constituting the dark sector of the universe can be reduced to detection of extremely weak links or couplings between cavities and modes. This method allows utilisation of extremely sensitive frequency metrology methods that are not limited by traditional requirements on ultra low temperatures, strong magnetic fields and sophisticated superconducting technology. We show that exceptional points in the eigenmode structure of coupled modes may be used to boost the sensitivity of dark matter mediated weak links. We find observables that are proportional to fractional powers of fundamental coupling constants. Particularly, in the case of axion detection, it is demonstrated that resonance frequency scaling with \u223c g a\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b8 and \u223c 3 g a\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b8 dependencies can be realised in a ternary photonic cavity system, which is beneficial as these coupling constants are extremely small.",

This includes axions 3,4 and paraphotons 5,6 which have both been subjects of extensive experimental searches in the last few decades [7][8][9][10][11][12] , and recently there has been a renewed interest with many new and forthcoming experiments [13][14][15][16] . Traditionally, the detection methods are based on low noise power detection techniques, where one searches for excess photon power created by the interaction process between photons and these putative particles 12 . Much progress has been made in the design and optimisation of such experiments, with particular recent focus on the push to high (> 1 GHz) and low (< 100 MHz) frequency ranges [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] . Such particles may come from some extraterrestrial sources such as galactic halo axions, or be created artificially with another interaction process, such as Light Shining Through A Wall (LSW) experiments 27,28 .",

            "text": "A conceptually different approach is based on detecting frequency splittings in the spectrum of a two-fold degenerate system, which can be broken due to the existence of a weak link between the two photonic cavities mediated by an intermediate interaction with a hypothetical particle 13 . In this approach, hypothetical particles created in one cavity are transferred into another, interacting with the second cavity photons and vice a versa creating a weak link that shifts eigenfrequencies of the system. Such a method of detection measures the lifting of the degeneracy of the system as a frequency shift, a technique commonly used in physics and engineering. Indeed, with the emergence of ultra-high Quality factor cavities in the optical and microwave regions of the photon spectrum, the frequency shift approach has found numerous applications, including biosensing, magnetic field and mass sensing, etc [29][30][31] and has been proposed as a means to detect paraphotons previously 13 . Many well developed a) Electronic mail: michael.tobar@uwa.edu.au frequency measurement techniques have been devised, which allow for high sensitivity of these kinds of measurements when applied to particular sensing problems. Similar frequency control methods of frequency comparison of uncoupled oscillators, frequency generators, are used in rotating experiments to search for Lorentz violating modifications to the standard model extensions 32, 33 . More generally, frequency metrology has established itself as a leading tool in the search for new physics 34-37 . Unlike in the power detection scheme where the detection limit is set by noise sources in the measurement chain and thus ultimately limited by fundamental stochastic processes, the frequency detection approach is limited by mode linewidths and source frequency stability, that have been pushed by many orders of magnitude with ongoing progress in these areas. For example, ultra-narrow linewidth systems have achieved Quality factors of > 10 9 for microwave and optical resonators 38,39 . Due to these achievements, frequency stability of microwave cryogenic sapphire clocks is approaching 10 \u221216 level 40,41 , whereas optical clocks have reached 10 \u221218 level of stability and accuracy 42 . In the same time, uncertainty of modern voltage standards based on Josephson junctions is only parts in 10 \u22128 level 43 . This comparison suggests that the frequency metrology approach might be generally a more sensitive tool in detecting physics of the Dark Universe.",

            "text": "One way to further improve the sensitivity of a twofolddegenerate resonant detector is to move from a system degenerate only in eigenfrequencies and represented by a Diabolic Point (DP), to a system also degenerate in eigenstates and represented by an Exceptional Point 44,45 . Existence of these points in non-Hermitian systems has been analysed theoretically 46,47 and observed experimentally in different physical contexts [48][49][50][51][52] . It has been demonstrated that for a sufficiently small perturbation \u03b5 \u03c90 1 acting on one of the resonant subsystems with angular frequency \u03c9 0 , the corresponding observable frequency shift of the total system is proportional to \u03b5 1/2 if the detector works at the doubly degenerate EP. This result is a clear advantage over an \u03b5 dependent frequency shift observed in the case of a DP. Moreover, the power of the shift inversely scales with the order of degeneracy of the system, n, giving in general a \u03b5 1/n dependence 49 . In this work, we consider applications of this idea to detection of weak links arising in the context of detection of theoretical fundamental particles. In this problem the perturbation acting on one or both subsystems, for example, cavities, is replaced with a weak link \u03b6 \u03c9 0 between them.",

Laboratory searches for these hidden sector particles put bounds on the strength of the kinetic mixing and are dominated by LSW type experiments 54,55 . In this experiment two spatial regions, e.g. cavities, are separated with a wall impenetrable to normal photons. One of these regions is strongly pumped with photons, which generates paraphotons that can penetrate the other region and mix with the thermal and vacuum photons in that cavity. This effect can be detected as an excess power in the second region. It should be noted that this approach is not sensitive to galactic halo dark matter paraphotons, but to paraphotons generated inside the first region. The sensitivity of these approaches are limited not only by the noise floor of the setup but more by systematic effects such as direct leakage of photons into the detection region. Also, some constraints on paraphotons can be obtained from cosmic microwave background data 56 and Coulomb law experiments 57 . Alternatively, for the LSW type experiments, one may search for modifications of the system eigenvalues as a response to the paraphoton mediated cavity coupling 13 . In this section we demonstrate the appearance of this coupling.",

The detector utilises the inverse-Primakoff effect, in an interaction between virtual photons from a strong DC magnetic field and galactic halo axions, creating a real photon of a frequency corresponding to the axion mass. The resulting signal photons are detected using a resonant cavity as an antenna tuned to this frequency 12, 14 . In principle, instead of a virtual photon supplied by a DC magnetic field, one can use real photons by engaging another cavity or a mode 61 and utilise the same power detection techniques. Contrary to this, one may also measure how the resonant frequencies of the two modes are shifted as a result of interaction between the two photons and an axion signal -this is the weak link problem. Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that the weak coupling detection problem may be relvant to the search for galactic halo dark matter axions 37 .

Existence of these points has been recently demonstrated in a PT -symmetric ternary system realised as a photonic laser molecule 49 . In this section, we analyse if such an arrangement may result in improved weak link detection. The ternary cavity structure consists of one lossy (left), one neutral (central) and one gain (right) cavity as shown in Fig. 4 (A). Each of the left and right cavities is normally coupled to the central element with the strength g. The weak link to be detected is introduced between the right and left cavities. It can be easily demonstrated, that in the PTsymmetry case (\u03b3 L = \u03b3 R = \u03b3, \u03b3 C = 0), the system exhibits a triple EP when \u03b3 = \u221a 2g. In this case all three eigenvalues as well as corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The corresponding sensitivity to a weak link as defined in Eq.

Firstly, one can employ external low noise sources and measure eigenmode frequency deviations by comparing the source frequency with the frequency of the signal transmitted through or reflected from the system. Secondly, one may use eigenmodes of the system as a frequency selective element in a feedback oscillator and measure its frequency either in a dual loop or single loop approach 37 .

To demonstrate this fact, we assume the widely accepted fact that the frequency can be effectively controlled and measured to about 10 \u22126 of available cavity linewidth 63 that sets sensitivity for the given observation time. Thus a 10GHz oscillator based on a dielectric resonator with Q = 10 8 would be able to immediately detect induced variations on the order of 10 \u22124 Hz. In the same time, the second order EP based detector would be able to resolve variations on the order of 10 \u22127 \u2212 10 \u22128 Hz. Although, this improvement is achieved due to increased complexity: the method requires precise engineering of gain/loss factors as a function of mode couplings. Exact implementation and adjustment of these details will be a base for future particular proposals.",

Futhermore, small perturbation detection with EPs has been demonstrated previously in the optical frequency spectrum 49,70 . Moreover, axion upconversion allows application of optical cavities and techniques for search of axions in microwave and RF frequency ranges 37 . The mainstream platform for these demonstrations as well as many other related PT -symmetry experiments utilises WGMs in coupled microtoroids and an active medium (ion doped crystals) for gain. It should also be emphasised that unlike all traditional power detection techniques for axion detection, the frequency metrology approach does not require any external magnetic fields 37 , thus, allowing utilisation of magnetic impurities and magnetically active crystals as a source of gain.",

For many years, the fields of direct axion and paraphoton dark matter detection suffered from a scarcity of methods that are linear in the relevant small coupling constants 37,76 . Only recently a few new techniques that are linear in coupling have been demonstrated. In this work we, for the first time, propose a concept in which an observable, resonance frequency shift is better than linear in coupling to the dark matter particle. In particular, we propose two ternary mode systems that can provide frequency shifts scaling as square and cubic roots of the small coupling constants. In the context of galactic halo axions this means frequency shifts proportional to \u223c g a\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b8 and \u223c 3 g a\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b8, greatly improving prospects for detection.",
