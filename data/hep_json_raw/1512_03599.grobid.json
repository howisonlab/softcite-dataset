            "text": "The COmmon Muon and Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy (COMPASS) is a multi-purpose fixed-target experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) aimed at studying the structure and spectrum of hadrons. The twostage spectrometer has a good acceptance for charged as well as neutral particles over a wide kinematic range and is thus able to measure a wide range of reactions. Light mesons are studied with negative (mostly \u03c0 \u2212 ) and positive (p, \u03c0 + ) hadron beams with a momentum of 190 GeV/c. The light-meson spectrum is investigated in various final states produced in diffractive dissociation reactions at squared four-momentum transfers to the target between 0.1 and 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 . The flagship channel is the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, for which COMPASS has recorded the currently largest data sample. These data not only allow for measuring the properties of known resonances with high precision, but also for searching for new states. Among these is a new resonance-like signal, the a 1 (1420), with unusual properties. The findings are confirmed by the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state. Possible bias introduced by the parametrizations used to describe the \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave is studied using a novel analysis technique, which extracts the amplitude of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sub-system as a function of 3\u03c0 mass from the data. Of particular interest is the resonance content of the partial wave with spin-exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ quantum numbers, which are forbidden for quark-antiquark states. This wave is studied in the two 3\u03c0 channels. Further insight is gained by studying diffractively produced \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 or \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 final states.",

By convention, the C-parity is that of the neutral partner of the X \u2212 in the isospin triplet. A comparison of the two channels also gives insight into the role of flavor symmetry.

In this process, the beam hadron is excited to some intermediate state X \u2212 via t-channel Reggeon exchange with the target. At 190 GeV/c beam momentum pomeron exchange is dominant. Diffractive reactions are known to exhibit a rich spectrum of intermediate states X \u2212 . In the past, several candidates for spin-exotic mesons have been reported in pion-induced diffraction [2,3]. The mesonic states X \u2212 decay into various multi-hadron final states, which are detected by the spectrometer. Here, we consider the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 , \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 channels. In order to disentangle the different contributing intermediate states X \u2212 , for each final state a partial-wave analysis (PWA) is performed. In addition to the final-state particles from the X \u2212 decays, the recoiling proton is also measured. This helps to suppress backgrounds and ensures an exclusive measurement by applying energy and momentum conservation in the event selection.",

It is customary to use the reduced fourmomentum transfer t \u2261 |t| \u2212 |t| min instead of t, where |t| min is the minimum value of |t| for a given invariant mass of X \u2212 . The analyses presented are all performed in the range 0.1 < t < 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 . X \u2212 is described in the Gottfried-Jackson frame by spherical harmonics. The partial waves are defined by the orbital angular momentum L between the pion and the \u03b7 ( ) , which corresponds to the spin J of the X \u2212 , by the absolute value M of the spin projection, and by the reflectivity = \u00b11, which corresponds to the naturality of the exchanged particle. Partial waves with = \u22121 are found to be negligibly small, except for the S wave with M = 0, which contributes 0.5% in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 and 1.1% in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 channel. This is in agreement with the expected pomeron dominance at high energies. For positive reflectivity (naturality), only waves with M \u2265 1 are allowed so that L = J \u2265 1. The data are dominated by M = 1 partial waves. The PWA model includes M = 1 waves with L = 1 to 6. Higher M states are suppressed. Only the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 D wave shows significant intensity for M = 2.",

With this additional binning in t , the dependence of the partial-wave amplitudes on the four-momentum transfer can be studied in detail. The details of the analysis model are described in Ref. [9].

The amplitudes do contain information not only about the partialwave intensities, but also about the relative phases of the partial waves. The latter are crucial for resonance extraction.

The most interesting of these waves is the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave, which contributes less than 1% to the total intensity. Previous analyses claimed a resonance, the \u03c0 1 (1600), at about 1.6 GeV/c 2 in this channel [10,11]. Figure 3 left shows the intensity of this partial wave for the two final states (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in red, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 in blue). The two distributions are scaled to have the same integral. Both decay channels are in fair agreement and exhibit a broad enhancement extending from about 1.0 to 1.8 GeV/c 2 in m 3\u03c0 . In the 1.0 to 1.2 GeV/c 2 mass range the intensity depends strongly on the details of the fit model. Peak-like structures in this region are probably due to imperfections of the applied PWA model.",

At values of t below about 0.3 (GeV/c) 2 , we observe no indication of a resonance peak around m 3\u03c0 = 1.6 GeV/c 2 , where we would expect the \u03c0 1 (1600). For the t bins in the interval from 0.449 to 1.000 (GeV/c) 2 , the observed intensities exhibit a very different shape as compared to the low-t region, with a peak structure emerging at about 1.6 GeV/c 2 and the intensity at lower masses disappearing rapidly with increasing t . This is in contrast to clean resonance signals like the a 2 (1320) in the 2 ++ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 D wave, which, as expected, do not change their shape with t . The observed t behavior of the 1 \u2212+ intensity is therefore a strong indication that non-resonant contributions play a dominant role. Interestingly, the relative phases of the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P wave with respect to other waves are virtually independent of t . As an example, Fig. 3 right shows the phase relative to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave for four t bins. In all bins, a slowly rising phase with a total phase motion of about 60\u00b0is observed around the 1.6 GeV/c 2 region.",

As a first step towards a better understanding of the non-resonant contribution, Monte-Carlo data were generated that are distributed according to a model of the Deck effect. The model employed here is very similar to that used in Ref. [13]. The partial-wave projection of these Monte Carlo data is shown as green points in Fig. 4. In order to compare the intensities of real data and the Deck-model pseudo data, the Monte Carlo data are scaled to the t -summed intensity of the 1 \u2212+ wave as observed in real data. At values of t below about 0.3 (GeV/c) 2 , the intensity distributions of real data and Deck Monte Carlo exhibit strong similarities suggesting that the observed intensity might be saturated by the Deck effect. Starting from t \u2248 0.4 (GeV/c) 2 , the spectral shapes for Deck pseudodata and real data deviate from each other with the differences increasing towards larger values of t . This leaves room for a potential resonance signal. It should be noted, however, that the Deck pseudo data contain no resonant contributions. Therefore, potential interference effects between the resonant and non-resonant amplitudes cannot be assessed in this simple approach.",

However, we cannot exclude that the fit results are biased by the employed isobar parametrizations. This is true in particular for the isoscalar J PC = 0 ++ isobars. In the PWA model, a broad \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave component is used, the parametrization of which is extracted from \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave elastic-scattering data [20]. In addition, the f 0 (980), described by a Flatt\u00e9 form [21], and the f 0 (1500), parametrized by a relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitude, are included as isobars. In order to study possible bias due to these parametrizations and to ensure that the observed a 1 (1420) signal is truly related to the narrow f 0 (980), a novel analysis method [9] inspired by Ref. [22] was developed. In this so-called freed-isobar analysis, the three fixed parametrizations for the 0 ++ isobar amplitudes are replaced by a set of piecewise constant complex-valued functions that fully cover the allowed twopion mass range. This way the whole 0 ++ isobar amplitude is extracted as a function of the 3\u03c0 mass. In contrast to the conventional isobar approach, which uses the same isobar parametrization in different partial waves, the freed-isobar method permits different isobar amplitudes for different intermediate states X \u2212 . A more detailed description of the analysis method can be found in Ref. [9].",

            "text": "The freed-isobar method leads to a reduced model dependence and gives additional information about the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 subsystem at the cost of a considerable increase in the number of free parameters in the PWA fit. Thus, even for large data sets, the freed-isobar approach can only be applied to a subset of partial waves. We performed a freed-isobar PWA, where the fixed parametrizations of the broad \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave component, of the f 0 (980), and of the f 0 (1500) were replaced by piece-wise constant isobar amplitudes for the 3\u03c0 partial waves 0 \u2212+ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 S , 1 ++ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 P, and Figure 7 top shows the two-dimensional intensity distribution of the 1 ++ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 P wave as a function of m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and m 3\u03c0 . The distribution exhibits a broad maximum around m 3\u03c0 = 1.2 GeV/c 2 and between 0.6 and 0.8 GeV/c 2 in m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . A smaller peak is observed in the f 0 (980) region at m 3\u03c0 \u2248 1.4 GeV/c 2 . This peak is more obvious in Fig. 7 bottom left, which shows the intensity distribution summed over the two-pion mass interval around the f 0 (980) as indicated by the pair of horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 7 top. The peak is similar in position and shape to the a 1 (1420) peak in the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave (cf. Fig. 5). The resonant nature of the f 0 (980) becomes apparent in Fig. 7 bottom right, which shows the m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 dependence of the extracted amplitude at the a 1 (1420) peak in form of an Argand diagram. The phase is measured with respect to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave. The f 0 (980) contribution shows up as a semicircle-like structure (highlighted by the blue line) with a shifted origin. This demonstrates that the observed a 1 (1420) signal in the f 0 (980) \u03c0 decay mode is not an artifact of the 0 ++ isobar parametrizations used in the conventional PWA method. More results of the freed-isobar PWA are discussed in Refs. [9,23]. ",
