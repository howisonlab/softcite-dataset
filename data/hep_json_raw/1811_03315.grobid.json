A possible alternative to the simple Regge-pole model as input is a double pole (double Pomeron pole, or simply dipole Pomeron, DP) in the angular momentum (j) plane. It has a number of advantages over the simple Pomeron Regge pole. In particular, it produces logarithmically rising cross sections already at the \"Born\" level.",

The above data point lies well below the expectations (extrapolations) from lower energies, although this should not be dramatized. The flexibility of the odderon parametrization leaves room for perfect fits to this data point simultaneously with the total cross section. More critical is the inclusion of non-forward data, both for pp andpp especially around the dip region, to which the odderon is sensitive! Figure 1 shows the results of our fits to pp and pp scattering data, including the ratio \u03c1. The option without the odderon (shown as dotted line) does not fit the new 13 TeV data point. However, we found that neglecting the oddereon has no significant effect on the description of the total cross-section measurements. The forward slope, defined as",
