Candidate events are selected in the dilepton topology with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. The difference in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons in the laboratory frame is used to extract the correlation between the top and antitop quark spins. In the helicity basis the measured degree of correlation corresponds to A helicity \u00bc 0:40 \u00fe0:09 \u00c00:08 , in agreement with the next-to-leading-order standard model prediction. The hypothesis of zero spin correlation is excluded at 5.1 standard deviations.",

            "text": "The top quark was discovered in 1995 [1,2] at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. The lifetime of the top quark is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the time scale for strong interactions, implying that the top quark decays before hadronization [3][4][5][6][7]. Therefore the spin of the top quark at production is transferred to its decay products and can be measured directly via their angular distributions [4]. While the polarization of t and \" t quarks in a hadronically produced t \" t sample is predicted to be very small, their spins are predicted to be correlated [8][9][10]. In this Letter the hypothesis that the correlation of the spin of top and antitop quarks in t \" t events is as expected in the standard model (SM), as opposed to the hypothesis that they are uncorrelated, is tested. This tests the precise predictions of t \" t pair production and of top quark decay, which is expected to occur before its spin is flipped by the strong interaction [9][10][11][12][13]. Many scenarios of new physics beyond the SM predict different spin correlations while keeping the t \" t production cross section within experimental and theoretical bounds [14][15][16][17][18]. For example, the spin correlation measured in this Letter may differ from the SM if the t \" t pairs were produced via the exchange of a virtual heavy scalar Higgs boson [19] or if the top quark decayed into a scalar charged Higgs boson and a b quark (t ! H \u00fe b) [20].",

The magnetic field is provided by a barrel and two end-cap superconducting toroid magnets. A three-level trigger system is used to select events with high-p T leptons for this analysis. The firstlevel trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the trigger rate to 75 kHz.

The jet energy scale and its uncertainty are derived by combining information from test-beam data, LHC collision data and simulation [45]. For jets within the acceptance, the jet energy scale varies in the range 4%-10% as a function of jet p T and , including an additional uncertainty due to multiple pp interactions. The energy resolution for jets is measured in dijet events and agrees with predictions from simulation within 10% for jets with p T > 30 GeV. The jet reconstruction efficiency is evaluated using minimum bias and dijet events and depends on the p T of the jet. Its systematic uncertainty is in the range 1%-3% based on the comparison of data and MC simulation. The uncertainties from the energy scale and resolution corrections for leptons and jets are propagated into the calculation of E miss T . The uncertainty on the kinematic properties of the t \" t signal events gives rise to systematic uncertainties on the shape of the \u00c1 distribution and signal acceptance. This is evaluated by considering the choice of generator, the parton shower and fragmentation model, the modeling of initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR), the PDF and top quark mass. The generator uncertainty is evaluated by comparing the MC@NLO predictions with those of POWHEG [46][47][48] interfaced to HERWIG. To estimate the uncertainty due to the parton shower modeling and fragmentation, the difference between POWHEG interfaced to HERWIG (cluster fragmentation) and PYTHIA [49] (string fragmentation) is taken. The uncertainty due to ISR/FSR is evaluated using the ACERMC generator [50] interfaced to the PYTHIA shower model, by varying the parameters controlling ISR and FSR in a range consistent with those used in the Perugia Hard/ Soft tune variations [51]. The average of the absolute values of the upward and downward variations is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The impact of the choice of PDF in simulation was studied by reweighting the MC samples to three PDF sets (CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008NLO [52], and NNPDF20 [53]) and taking the largest of either the variation interval (from the error sets) or difference between the central values of any two PDF sets [32]. The systematic uncertainty associated with the top quark mass is assessed using MC@NLO samples generated assuming different top quark masses in the range 167.5 to 177.5 GeV in increments of 2.5 GeV. The values of f SM are fitted as a linear function of the top quark mass and a conservative systematic uncertainty is obtained by evaluating this function at 172:5 AE 2:5 GeV.",

An uncertainty on the DD Z= \u00c3 \u00fe jets estimation is evaluated by varying the E miss T cut in the control region by AE5 GeV and is found to be negligible. A mismodeling of the Z-boson p T is observed in the Z-boson dominated control region.

For the DD fake lepton background the systematic uncertainty affects the shape of the \u00c1 distribution. Systematic uncertainties are derived by adjusting the signal region composition based on uncertainties estimated from MC simulation, and by comparing data and MC samples.
