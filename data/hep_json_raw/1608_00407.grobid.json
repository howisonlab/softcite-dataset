Charged tracks are reconstructed from hits in the MDC and are required to have polar angles within | cos \u03b8| < 0.93. The points of closest approach of the charged tracks to the interaction point (IP) are required to be within 1 cm in the plane perpendicular to the beam (V r ) and \u00b110 cm along the beam (V z ). Information from the TOF system and dE/dx in the MDC are combined to form PID confidence levels (C.L.) for the \u03c0, K and p hypotheses. Each track is assigned to the particle type with the highest PID C.L.. To avoid backgrounds from beam interactions with residual gas or detector materials (beam pipe and MDC inner wall), a further requirement V r < 0.2 cm is imposed for proton. \u039b + c candidates are reconstructed by considering all combinations of charged tracks in the final states of interest pK \u2212 \u03c0 + , p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and pK + K \u2212 . Two variables, the energy difference \u2206E = E \u2212 E beam and the beamconstrained mass M BC = E 2 beam /c 4 \u2212 p 2 /c 2 , are used to identify the \u039b + c candidates. Here, E beam is the beam energy, and E(p) is the reconstructed energy (momentum) of the \u039b + c candidate in the e + e \u2212 c.m. system. A \u039b + c candidate is accepted with M BC > 2.25GeV/c 2 and |\u2206E| < 20 MeV (corresponding to 3 time of resolution). For a given signal mode, we accept only one candidate per \u039b c charge per event. If multiple candidates are found, the one with the smallest |\u2206E| is selected. The \u2206E sideband region, 40 < |\u2206E| < 60 MeV, is defined to investigate potential backgrounds. For the \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, we reject K 0 S and \u039b candidates by requiring |M \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2212 M PDG ) mass quoted from the PDG [16] and M \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (M p\u03c0 \u2212 ) is the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (p\u03c0 \u2212 ) invariant mass. These requirements suppress the peaking backgrounds of the CF decays \u039b +",

As a consequence, 152 we are not able to distinguish between the theoretical 153 predictions among the different models [3-9]. 154 The SCS decay \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 proceeds via the exter-155 nal W -emission, internal W -emission and W -exchange 156 processes, while the SCS decay \u039b + c \u2192 pK + K \u2212 proceeds 157 via the internal W -emission and W -exchange diagrams 158 only. Precisely measuring and comparing their BFs may 159 help to reveal the \u039b c internal dynamics [1]. A measure-160 ment of the SCS mode \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c6 is of particular interest 161 because it receives contributions only from the internal 162 W -emission diagrams, which can reliably be obtained by 163 a factorization approach [1]. An improved measurement 164 of the \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c6 BF is thus essential to validate theoreti-165 cal models and test the application of large-N c factoriza-166 tion in the charmed baryon sector [17], where, N c is the 167 number of colors. 168 In this Letter, we describe a search for the SCS decays 169 \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and present an improved measurement of 170 the \u039b + c \u2192 pK + K \u2212 non-\u03c6 and \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c6 BFs.
