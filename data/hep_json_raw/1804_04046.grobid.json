            "text": "DANSS is a highly segmented 1 m 3 plastic scintillator detector. Its 2500 one meter long scintillator strips have a Gdloaded reflective cover. The DANSS detector is placed under an industrial 3.1 GW th reactor of the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant 350 km NW from Moscow. The distance to the core is varied on-line from 10.7 m to 12.7 m. The reactor building provides about 50 m water-equivalent shielding against the cosmic background. DANSS detects almost 5000 \u03bd e per day at the closest position with the cosmic background less than 3%. The inverse beta decay process is used to detect\u03bd e . Sterile neutrinos are searched for assuming the 4\u03bd model (3 active and 1 sterile \u03bd). The exclusion area in the \u2206m 2 14 , sin 2 2\u03b8 14 plane is obtained using a ratio of positron energy spectra collected at different distances. Therefore results do not depend on the shape and normalization of the reactor\u03bd e spectrum, as well as on the detector efficiency. Results are based on 966 thousand antineutrino events collected at three different distances from the reactor core. The excluded area covers a wide range of the sterile neutrino parameters up to sin 2 2\u03b8 14 < 0.01 in the most sensitive region.",

            "text": "Oscillations of the three neutrino flavors are well established. Two mass differences and three angles describing such oscillations have been measured [1]. Additional light active neutrinos are excluded by the measurements of the Z boson decay width [2]. Nevertheless, existence of additional sterile neutrinos is not excluded. Moreover, indications of several effects observed with about 3\u03c3 significance level can be explained by active-sterile neutrino oscillations. The GALEX and SAGE Gallium experiments performed calibrations with radioactive sources and reported the ratio of numbers of observed to predicted events of 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 [3]. This deficit is the so called \"Gallium anomaly\" (GA) [4]. Mueller et al. [5] made new estimates of the reactor\u03bd e flux which is about 6% higher than experimental measurements at small distances. This deficit is the so called \"Reactor antineutrino anomaly\" (RAA). Both anomalies can be explained by active-sterile neutrino oscillations at very short distances requiring a mass-squared difference of the order of 1 eV 2 [6]. The LSND collaboration reported observation of\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e mixing with the mass-squared difference bigger than \u223c 0.1 eV 2 [7]. However, results of the MiniBooNE tests of this signal are inconclusive and probably indicate additional effects [8]. There are also cosmological constraints on the effective number of neutrinos [9]. However, in several theoretical models sterile neutrinos are still compatible with these constraints. Details can be found in a review of sterile neutrinos [10].",

Measurements at only one distance from a reactor core are not sufficient since the theoretical description of the\u03bd e energy distribution is considered not to be reliable enough. The most reliable way to observe such distortions is to measure the\u03bd e spectrum with the same detector at different distances. In this case, the shape and normalization of the\u03bd e spectrum as well as the detector efficiency are canceled out. Detector positions should be changed frequently enough in order to cancel out time variations of the detector and reactor parameters. The DANSS experiment uses this strategy and measures\u03bd e spectra at 3 distances from the reactor core centre: 10.7 m, 11.7 m, and 12.7 m to the detector centre. The detector positions are changed typically 3 times a week. Antineutrinos are detected by means of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) reactio\u00f1 \u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n with E\u03bd = E e + + 1.80 MeV.",

The DANSS spectrometer does not contain any flammable or other dangerous liquids and may therefore be located very close to the core of a 3.1 GW th industrial power reactor at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) 350 km NW of Moscow. DANSS is installed under the reactor core. The reactor cauldron, cooling pond, concrete and other materials provide a good shielding equivalent to \u223c 50 m of water, which removes the hadronic component of the cosmic background and reduces the cosmic muon flux by a factor of 6. The size of the reactor core is quite big (3.7 m in height and 3.2 m in diameter) which leads to the smearing of the oscillation pattern. This drawback is compensated by a high\u03bd e flux of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 13\u03bd e /cm 2 /s at a distance of 11 m.",

            "text": "Each 50 parallel strips are combined into a module, so that the whole detector (2500 strips) is a structure of 50 intercrossing modules. Each module is viewed with a compact photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu R7600U-300) coupled to all 50 strips of the module via 100 WLS fibers, two per strip. PMTs are placed inside the shielding but outside the copper layer, which serves also as a module frame. In addition, to get a more precise energy and space pattern of an event, each strip is equipped with an individual Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM) (MPPC S12825-050C(X)) coupled to the strip via the third WLS fiber. The SiPM is fixed directly at the end of the strip using a plastic light connector. All signals are digitized with specially designed 12 bit, 125 MHz FADCs [13]. Only front-end electronics is placed inside the shielding but outside the Cu layer. All other electronics is placed outside of the detector shielding. One 6U VME board serves 64 channels. SiPMs (PMTs) register about 18 (20) photoelectrons (p.e.) per MeV. These numbers were obtained using measurements with cosmic muons and artificially driven LEDs. So the total number is 38 p.e./MeV. Parameterized strip response non-uniformities have been incorporated into the GEANT4 (Version 4.10.4) MC simulation of the detector. The MC simulation included also a spread in the light yields of different strips, dead channels, Poisson fluctuations in the number of p.e. at the first 2 PMT dinodes, the excess noise factor for SiPMs due to the optical cross-talk between pixels. The experimental energy resolution for cosmic muon signals in the scintillator strips is 15% worse than that from the MC calculation. Therefore, the MC estimations are scaled up by the corresponding factor. Figure 2 shows the simulated DANSS response to a 4.125 MeV positron signal. The energy resolution is modest (\u03c3/E = 17% for the Gaussian part of the spectrum). This leads to additional smearing of the oscillation pattern, comparable with the smearing due to the large reactor core size. Figure 3 shows the energy distribution of neutron capture signals from a 248 Cm source placed at the center of the detector. Two peaks correspond to the neutron capture by protons and by Gd. The fit of the first peak gives a resolution compatible with the MC simulations (see Table 1). The MC describes well the high energy part of the n-Gd peak, although there is some tension in the tail. Figure 4(a) shows the difference between the MC and data divided by the data for the main part of the n-Gd peak. There is a good agreement between the MC and data. On the other hand, the relative changes of 1% in the MC positron energy scale or of 5% in the MC energy resolu-tion lead to serious discrepancies between the data and MC (see Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c)). This comparison provides the upper limits on the systematic uncertainties of these parameters. It is very difficult to simulate reliably the low energy part of the n-Gd capture signal since there are many cascade decay chains with unknown probabilities. Our MC does not describe well the lower energy part of the spectrum and hence we do not use it for the comparison. Figure 5 shows the energy distribution of signals from a 60 Co and 22 Na \u03b3-sources placed in the center of the detector. The observed energy resolutions and peak positions are consistent with the MC expectations (see Table 1). The visible energy in the detector from the radioactive sources is lower than the source energy due to losses in inactive strip reflective layers, dead channels and photons escaped from the detector. SiPM gain calibration was performed using noise signals typically every 5 days. Calibration with cosmic muons of all strips in the whole detector was also performed once in \u223c 5 days. A detailed description of the calibration procedure is presented elsewhere [14]. Using the high granularity of the detector, we reconstruct muons crossing the strips at different angles. For each angle, we calculate the track length in the strip and the deposited energy in p.e. The same procedure is performed using MC muons but in this case, the corresponding energy deposition in MeV is obtained from the GEANT4 simulations. For each bin in the muon crossing angle the most probable energy values are obtained for the data and MC using the fits of the corresponding Landau spectra. The measured energy versus the calculated energy is shown in Fig. 6. The response is linear within 0.7% in the (1.8-4.7) MeV energy range. The energy measured with PMTs is proportional on average to the energy, measured with SiPMs. This was checked comparing the positron energy from IBD events reconstructed with SiPMs and with PMTs. The PMT linearity was also checked using the LED calibration system. Therefore, the PMT energy response is also linear. Positrons with energies higher than 4.7 MeV typically deposit their energy in several strips. Therefore, the detector response should be linear for high energies as well. ",

            "text": "The trigger of the experiment is produced when the digital sum of all PMT signals is above 0.7 MeV or the energy in the veto system is larger than 4 MeV. The IBD process appears in the data as two distinct events, prompt and delayed. For each trigger, waveforms for all SiPMs and PMTs are recorded in 512 ns windows. The data analysis is performed in several stages. The first one is the noise cleanup. At this step an average event time is calculated and all hits in SiPMs more than 15 ns away are rejected. Then single pixel SiPM hits which have no confirmation by the corresponding PMT are also rejected. After these two steps less than 2 noise SiPM hits per event survive out of about 40 in the original sample. At the next stage various characteristics of the event such as the total energy, the number of hits and so on are calculated. At this stage we also look for a continuous ionization cluster and calculate its visible energy. The visible energy of a positron cluster is converted using MC simulations into the deposited energy by taking into account average losses in the inactive reflective layers of the strips and dead channels. Sometimes pho- tons from the positron annihilation produce signals in the strips attributed to the positron cluster. This leads to an increase of the visible energy. Such a shift is also corrected on average using MC simulations. A typical size of the total correction is \u223c 2%. The next step is a search for the time-correlated pairs of prompt-delayed events. We start with searching for an event with more than 3.5 MeV energy deposit. This is a delayed event candidate unless it has the muon veto (more than 4 MeV energy in a veto counter or more than 1 hit in the veto counters with a low threshold of \u223c0.15 MeV or more than 20 MeV energy in the main detector). Then we look backward in time searching for a prompt event with more than 1 MeV in the positron cluster and no muon veto. An IBD candidate pair is considered found if the time difference between the prompt and delayed events is in the range (2-50) \u00b5s. For a valid pair we also require no event with the muon veto within 60 \u00b5s before the prompt signal (within 200 \u00b5s if E > 300 MeV is released in the main detector). No other event should occur within 45 \u00b5s before and 80 \u00b5s after the prompt event. The found pairs of prompt and delayed events form the experimental sample of IBD candidates. The accidental background is a random coincidence of prompt (positronlike) and delayed (neutron-like) signals. It is proportional to the product of such signal rates. It does not depend on the difference in time between the corresponding signals since they are not correlated (the backgrounds from correlated pairs of signals are determined separately). Therefore, the accidental background can be directly measured in a model independent way by measuring the coincidence rate of electron-like and neutron-like signals sufficiently separated in time to exclude any correlation. This can be done for many independent time windows. Therefore, the accidental background can be measured with negligible statistical errors. Similar to the experimental sample of IBD candidates, the accidental coincidence sample is formed by looking for a prompt signal in 16 regions: 5, 10,..., 80 ms before the neutron candidate. This sample provides us with a model-independent measure of the accidental background with negligible statistical errors. Distributions for IBD candidates with accidental background, the accidental background and their difference, which represents the IBD candidate events without accidental background are presented in figures 7 and 8 for about 10% of the data taken first. Figure 7 shows the distance between positron and neutron candidates. The width of the signal distribution is determined by the neutron travel in the detector before the capture and the uncertainty of the neutron capture vertex reconstruction from the observed \u03b3-flash. The distribution of the neutron capture time from the positron production moment is presented in Fig. 8. The MC predictions agree nicely with the data. These two figures illustrate also the method used to get signal distributions: a parameter is plotted for the experimental data set of the IBD candidates and for the accidental background data set using the same selection criteria. A signal distribution is obtained as a difference of these two distributions. It is worth mentioning that the very procedure of the accidental background subtraction only negligibly increases the statistical errors in the signal distributions. This is because the accidental background is calculated using the 16 times larger sample of pairs. However, the final errors are determined by the initial counts in the IBD candidate sample, which include the accidental background. Therefore, several cuts are applied, in order to reduce the accidental background. They also reduce slightly the background from neutrons produced by cosmic muons. The cuts are designed to be very soft with respect to the signal in order to avoid any distortions. All cuts were selected without looking at the final results. They have been fixed after collection of about 10% of the data. The cuts include the following requirements:",

The total numbers of IBD events per day at the two positions were equal in the calculations of the R pre i . Thus, the \u03c7 2 does not depend on the integral IBD event rate dependence on the distance from the reactor core. Only differences in the positron energy shapes are considered. This is the most conservative approach. The results do not depend even on the changes of the detector efficiency as long as they do not depend on the positron energy. This approach reduces also the sensitivity of the results to the position of the reactor fuel burning profile center and the reactor power. The middle detector position adds very little to the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino parameters since the distance between the middle and top (bottom) positions is twice smaller than that for the bottom and top positions. Inclusion of the middle/top ratio into the analysis makes it less transparent since it is correlated with the bottom/top ratio. Therefore, the data at the middle detector position were used only for the important crosschecks of the results. Figure 12 shows the ratio of the positron spectra at the middle and top detector positions. The limits on the sterile neutrino parameters from this ratio are fully consistent with the limits from the bottom and top position but they are considerably weaker.",

For some values of \u2206m 2 14 the obtained limits are more stringent than previous results [18,19,20]. It is important to stress that our results are based only on the comparison of the shapes of the positron energy distributions at the two distances from the reactor core measured with the same detector. Therefore the results do not depend on the\u03bd e spectrum shape and normalization as well as on the detector efficiency. The excluded area covers a large fraction of regions indicated by the GA and RAA. In our analysis the point \u2206m 2 14 = 1.4 eV 2 , sin 2 2\u03b8 14 = 0.05 has the smallest \u03c7 2 = 21.9. The difference in \u03c7 2 with the 3\u03bd case is 13.1. The significance of this difference will be studied taking into account systematic uncertainties after collection of more data this year.

Then we calculate the confidence levels for the 4\u03bd and 3\u03bd hypotheses by integration of the two Gaussian distributions with the obtained mean values \u00b1\u00b5 and the same standard deviation \u03c3 from \u2206\u03c7 2 exp to infinity. The CL 4\u03bd and CL 3\u03bd quantify the consistency of the data with the corresponding hypothesis and the CL s = CL 4\u03bd /CL 3\u03bd . The point in the \u2206m 2 14 , sin 2 2\u03b8 14 plane is excluded at the 1-\u03b1 confidence level if CL s < \u03b1. Therefore the point is excluded only if the 3\u03bd hypothesis fits the data much better than the 4\u03bd hypothesis. Hence only points for which the experiment has a sensitivity to distinguish the 4\u03bd and 3\u03bd hypotheses can be excluded. The systematic uncertainties are treated as the nuisance parameters in [16]. The corresponding parameters with their errors are included into the minimization of the \u03c7 2 (see for example Eqn. 5 [16]). We treat the systematic uncertainties differently. We repeat the CL s analysis without the nuisance parameters for all combinations of the systematic uncertainties taken at their maximal deviations from the nominal values. The systematic uncertainties in the energy resolution, energy scale, and the level of the two types of the background are taken into account as described in the section 3. In addition, a separate study was performed to check the stability of the results with respect to the change of the energy range used in the analysis. It was checked that this approach is practically identical (but more transparent) to using the systematic uncertainties as the nuisance parameters with the minimization of the \u03c7 2 over a limited set of deviations of the systematic parameters taken at their maximal values. Since the influence of the systematic uncertainties on the final results is small this approximation of the minimization procedure should be sufficient. We can conclude that the CL s method used in this analysis provides the conservative exclusion limits on the sterile neutrino parameters.",

The calculations include the MC integration over the antineutrino production point in the reactor core and the positron position in the detector. The distribution of the antineutrino production points in the reactor core was provided by the KNPP. We used the distribution averaged over the campaign. It was checked that this approximation practically does not influence the final results. Then we convolute the resulting predictions with the detector resolution obtained by the MC for each energy point. The large size of the reactor core and modest energy resolution lead to a substantial smearing of the oscillation pattern. The theoretical predictions for 4\u03bd and 3\u03bd",
