            "text": "A comprehensive study of the atmospheric neutrino flux in the energy region from sub-GeV up to several TeV using the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov detector is presented in this paper. The energy and azimuthal spectra, and variation over time, of the atmospheric \u03bde+\u03bde and \u03bd\u00b5+\u03bd\u00b5 fluxes are measured. The energy spectra are obtained using an iterative unfolding method by combining various event topologies with differing energy responses. The azimuthal spectra depending on energy and zenith angle, and their modulation by geomagnetic effects, are also studied. A predicted east-west asymmetry is observed in both the \u03bde and \u03bd\u00b5 samples at 8.0 \u03c3 and 6.0 \u03c3 significance, respectively, and an indication that the asymmetry dipole angle changes depending on the zenith angle was seen at the 2.2 \u03c3 level. The measured energy and azimuthal spectra are consistent with the current flux models within the estimated systematic uncertainties. A study of the long-term correlation between the atmospheric neutrino flux and the solar magnetic activity cycle is performed, and a weak preference for a correlation was seen at the 1.1 \u03c3 level, using SK I-IV data spanning a 20 year period. For several particularly strong solar activity periods, corresponding to Forbush decrease events, no theoretical prediction is available but a deviation below the typical neutrino event rate is seen at the 2.4 \u03c3 level. The seasonal modulation of the neutrino flux is also examined, but the change in flux at the SK site is predicted to be negligible, and as expected no evidence for a seasonal correlation is seen.",

            "text": "Atmospheric neutrinos are one of the main experimentally available neutrino sources, observed in a wide energy region from 100 MeV up to the PeV scale [1]. They are generated after the interaction of cosmic rays with the air molecules in Earth's atmosphere, from the decay of secondary particles such as \u03c0 and K mesons. The form of the energy spectrum is well approximated by a powerlaw, although it is relatively suppressed below the GeV scale due to the rigidity cutoff effect on the primary cosmic rays, caused by Earth's magnetic field. The flavor ratio of \u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e +\u03bd e below the GeV scale is approximately two, considering the dominance of the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay chains, but increases towards higher energies. In neutrino detectors, atmospheric neutrinos are observed coming from all directions, as the Earth is mostly transparent for neutrinos below the PeV scale; the flight length from the production point to the detector thus varies from O (10) to O(10 4 ) km, depending on the zenith angle of the arrival direction. The neutrino flux in the horizontal direction is generally higher than that in the vertical direction, due to the longer path of the parent particles in the atmosphere; however in the sub-GeV region there is an east-west asymmetry due to the azimuthal dependence in the rigidity cutoff energy of the primary cosmic rays. Towards the higher energies, fewer neutrinos are produced as the \u03c0 and K decay lengths become longer than their path lengths in the atmosphere, and the parent particles reach the ground before decaying. Above around 100 TeV, so called \"prompt\" neutrinos coming from the fast decay of charmed mesons are expected to dominate, due to their much shorter decay length.",

In this paper we will discuss three such simulations performed by the HKKM [19,20], Bartol [21], and FLUKA [22] research groups. The HKKM model defines a primary cosmic ray spectrum based on BESS [23,24] and AMS [25,26] measurements. For interactions in the atmosphere, the DPMJET-III [27] hadronic interaction model is used, with some customized tuning for better agreement with the cosmic ray muon data. The JAM nuclear interaction model [28], which has better agreement with the \u03c0 production measurements by the HARP experiment [29], is also introduced below 32 GeV in the more recent HKKM11 model [20], resulting in a relative increase of the neutrino flux below 1 GeV when compared to HKKM07 [19]. The Bartol model adopts a primary proton spectrum that is relatively lower below 50 GeV, and the high energy nucleon flux has a flatter energy dependence [30]. TARGET version 2.1 [31] is used for the decay and interaction generator. The FLUKA flux model is so named as it uses the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation code [32], a widely used hadronic and electro-magnetic interaction model. In all of these simulations, three-dimensional particle tracking is performed for the primary and secondary particles.",

Conversely, it is possible to measure the atmospheric neutrino flux \u03a6 if the neutrino oscillation probability O is given. The measurements of the oscillation parameters by the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data have since been confirmed by several indendent experiments, and a consistent and accurate three-flavor oscillation parameterization has emerged, by combining data from each of the independent experiments. Thus, by taking the PDG values of the oscillation parameters [35] as the input, the neutrino flux \u03a6 can be measured at Super-Kamiokande.",

Since that measurement the flux simulations have also progressed from simple one-dimensional to three-dimensional calculations, and began to use complex geomagnetic field models instead of dipole approximations. The HKKM and Bartol simulations have further included bending of secondary particles due to the geomagnetic field in the atmosphere. These changes have led to significant modifications in the predictions of the azimuthal anisotropies [51][52][53]. Measuring in detail the angular distributions, in addition to the previously wellstudied zenith distributions, can thus be used as a further test of the flux simulations and their implementations of geomagnetic effects, and also to confirm the discovery of such azimuthal anisotropies.",

However, since 1948 the use of neutron monitors (NMs) provides a method to accurately and continuously track the neutron flux at the Earth's surface resulting from cosmic ray impacts [55], and the NM counts are generally believed to be well-correlated with the primary cosmic ray activity. In this paper we test for the anti-correlation of the atmospheric neutrino flux with the solar cycle, by searching for a correlation between the neutrino flux at SK and the neutron detection rates at various NMs operated by other institutes. This method is able to test on short timescales of O(1 h), as both neutrino and neutron observations take place on Earth, and the propagation of the solar wind within the solar system (with speed of the order 100 km s \u22121 ) need not be considered. We assume that the effect of the solar wind is uniform in the neighborhood of the Earth, such that we may expect a good correlation between the neutrino flux at the SK site and the neutron flux monitored at the NMs in various locations around the Earth.",

In the summer months the atmospheric density is increased at higher altitudes, and relatively more neutrinos are created by secondary particles decaying in-flight. Such changes are predicted [56] to be strongest at the polar regions, with a normalization change of a few percent around the GeV to TeV scale, but to become negligible moving towards to the equator where the seasonal variation in air density is less. While the variation of the atmospheric neutrino flux at SK is thus expected to be minimal, we also test for such a correlation in this paper. This paper continues by explaining the detector and atmospheric neutrino dataset in Section II, the energy spectrum measurement in Section III, the azimuthal spectrum measurement in Section IV, the solar modulation measurement in Section V, and concludes with a summary in Section VI.",

About 11,000 20-inch photomultipliers (PMTs) are mounted on the wall of the detector facing inwards, and observe the Cherenkov light emitted by charged particles produced by neutrino interactions in the ultra-pure water. An optically-separated region on the outer side also contains about 1,800 PMTs, which act as a veto for incoming cosmic ray events. The detector has excellent particle identification (PID) capability by using the Cherenkov ring's pattern and opening angle, separating showering-type events from track-type events, which are denoted as e-like or \u00b5-like events respectively. SK has four experimental phases so far. These are designated as SK-I (1996SK-I ( -2001, SK-II (2002, SK-III (2006, and SK-IV (2008-). The major detector changes that distinguish these periods are as follows. The SK-I period was ended when an implosion accident destroyed about half of the PMTs; the remaining PMTs were rearranged for even coverage during SK-II. For SK-III, full PMT coverage was restored, and with SK-IV came an improved front-end electronics system [59]. SK-IV is an ongoing experiment, and the data sets used in this paper include data until September 2014 for the energy spectrum and azimuthal analyses described in Section III and IV, and until April 2015 for the solar modulation analysis in Section V.",

In the Partially-Contained (PC) sample, the vertex is also inside this fiducial volume, but outgoing particles are allowed to exit the inner detector. PC events typically have longer charged particle tracks, which are therefore mostly muons induced by \u03bd \u00b5 charged-current (CC) interactions. In the UPward-going-MUon event sample (UPMU), neutrinos interacting with the surrounding rock create muons which enter the detector from below (down-going muons are ignored, as these are overwhelmingly produced by cosmic rays).

The efficiency in selecting true neutrino events is estimated for fully-contained events as >97%, and for partially contained events as >80% (im-proving to >95% for SK-III and IV) [60].

Single-ring events are of higher purity in neutrino flavor, while multi-ring events tend to have higher neutrino energy. Additional selection criteria to reduce the background of neutral-current (NC) and wrong-flavor CC events are applied; for the sub-GeV single-ring e-like events, NC produced \u03c0 0 backgrounds are reduced by a \u03c0 0 finder algorithm [64] which identifies events using a likelihood method, based around the reconstructed invariant mass assuming a \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay event (where the second \u03b3 ring was originally missed due to low energy or ring overlap). Sub-GeV multi-ring e-like events are also not used in these analyses in order to further avoid NC \u03c0 0 background. Another likelihood-based cut is applied for multi-GeV multi-ring e-like events, which is the same method as described in [8] but extended to include SK-IV, to reduce background contamination from hadronic events dominated by \u03b3 rings, produced by \u03c0 0 created in CC \u03bd \u00b5 and NC induced events.",

We see that all e-like and \u00b5-like sub-samples have a high purity of \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions, respectively. The systematic uncertainties on these purity estimations were calculated during this study, and found to be relatively small; less than 4 and 1.5 percentage points for all e-like and \u00b5-like sub-samples, respectively. Figure 1 shows the MC true neutrino energy distributions of the sub-samples, showing that each sample has a different energy sensitivity. The FC \u00b5-like sample extends above 10 GeV, while the e-like sample extends up to 100 GeV, indicating that \u00b5-like events in the fiducial volume beyond 10 GeV tend to exit the inner detector and be classified as PC events. The FC e-like sample has a lower neutrino energy threshold than the \u00b5-like sample (100 MeV as opposed to 200 MeV), due to the difference in Cherenkov threshold between the electrons/positrons and the muons which are produced in the CC interactions in water. The PC and UPMU samples approximately range from 1 GeV to 10 TeV, and classification into the respective sub-samples is also seen to cover different energy regions.",

The reconstructed energy spectra depending these parameters would then be predicted, and the values of the parameters measured by finding the best-fit to the experimentally measured spectra.

Fig. 13 shows the unfolded spectrum as a function of number of iterations, from one up to ten, on top of the previously-estimated regularization error. It is seen that at around five iterations, which we had adopted based on the pseudo-data test, the unfolded spectra are stable. Furthermore, the spectra are reproduced approximately within the estimated regularization uncertainties. Therefore, we conclude that the shapes of our unfolded spectra are not due to an unexpected additional bias from the unfolding procedure.",

The measured fluxes are consistent with these measurements in the overlap energy region greater than 100 GeV. There is some discrepancy with the Frejus measurement below 1 GeV, however due to the difference in geomagnetic cutoff at the Frejus site,   the low energy flux is expected to be a few tens of percent higher at that location [74].

Nonetheless, the possible existence of reconstruction errors directly dependent on the azimuthal angle is investigated. The dependence of reconstructed momentum on the azimuth angle is checked using the momentum of the Michel electrons coming from the decay of cosmic muons which stopped in the detector, and is found to be uniform to better than 0.6%. While the energy range of Michel electrons is lower than that of our event samples, this value should give a reasonable indication of the maximum energy scale asymmetry and is implemented as a systematic error. Other possible azimuthal biases, such as particle identification or ring counting, are tested by comparing the shape of the likelihood variable distributions between east and west-going single-ring events. The maximum shift in events between classifications is found to be less than 0.1% in each case, and is considered negligible [60]. Non-neutrino background events in the SK data, such as cosmic ray muons and other noise events, are estimated to represent 0.2% of events in the SK-I to SK-IV dataset [60], and any azimuthal asymmetry present in this background is considered negligible. Considering the neutrino flux at SK, the geomagnetic effects are expected to cause changes in the energy spectrum, neutrino path length, and neutrino / antineutrino flux ratio, depending on the azimuth angle. Any systematic error that depends on these factors should thus be considered. To give one clear example of this, we show in Fig. 17 the MC true energy spectra of \u00b5-like sub-GeV events, separated by east and west-going directions, where we see that the east-going flux is relatively skewed towards lower energies. The \"NEUT axial mass parame-ter\" systematic is at the \u223c 10% level when averaging over all events, but increases sharply for low-energy events in the O(100) MeV range; the east-going flux bins are thus assigned a systematic due to uncertainty in the neutrino cross section up to 3 percentage points higher than the west-going flux bins, due to their high proportions of low energy events.",

Similarly, when we plot the full azimuthal distributions, we are interested in testing their shape as a function of azimuth, rather than measuring the absolute normalization of the neutrino flux. Thus for each systematic error, we define it's normalization component as the average effect on all azimuthal bins, and it's azimuthally-dependent component as the effect on each bin relative to the average effect. The normalization component is discarded, and the azimuthallydependent components of all systematics are combined in quadrature to calculate the final systematic error in each azimuthal bin.",

This is not modeled as a systematic error, but the effects are accounted for by the high statistics of the SK MC in the forward-fitting procedure. The correlation for reconstructed single-ring events is plotted by energy in Fig. 18, which shows that for interactions at less than 400 MeV there is only a faint ability to even discriminate the neutrino's forward direction from its backwards one. Events in the range 400 < E \u03bd < 1330 are generally correlated at least within 90 \u2022 , which allows a reasonable separation between east and west-going events.

The asymmetry in the reconstructed lepton distributions is then expected to peak at around E rec \u223c 1 GeV, and also for events at around cos \u03b8 rec \u223c 0. The prediction of the asymmetry strength is somewhat higher than in the previous SK analysis [50], at which time the flux simulation considered geomagnetic effects on the primary cosmic ray particles only; the additional consideration of the bending of secondary cosmic rays in the atmosphere is seen to further enhance the dipole asymmetry prediction [51]. In the cos \u03b8 < \u22120.6 bins, the distribution of the true neutrino direction also shows a different shape compared to the reconstructed lepton directional distribution. The shape of the true distribution is due to the rigidity cutoff having a suppressive effect in both east and west directions for up-going (cos \u03b8 < 0) neutrinos. However, as this effect is strongest for sub-GeV events within \u223c 10 \u2022 of up-going, it is also washed out after reconstruction using the lepton direction.",

These data use the count rate of a specific Neutron Monitor, the Climax NM [82], as the parameter corresponding to the degree of solar activity. This parameter can be used as the model assumes that, after corrections for the local air pressure at the monitor, all NM counts are linearly inversely correlated with the solar flux modulation. In fact the plasma wind should affect the low-energy primary flux more strongly; then areas with a low rigidity cutoff, which have relatively more flux at low-energy, should experience a larger decrease in flux. However if two NMs are located at different rigidity cutoffs, it is assumed that while the gradient of the correlation will be different, a linear correlation is still applicable. The HKKM model calculates the effects at the SK site for a given Climax NM count, extrapolating the solar effect on neutrinos coming from all directions, considering that rigidity cutoff is a function of the direction as was shown in Fig. 15.",

Here, solar minimum is defined as a Climax NM count of 4150 counts hr \u22121 \u00d7 0.01. While higher values are occasionally recorded by the Climax NM, the change in neutrino flux as a function of NM count is expected to be negligible above this value. The normalization change weights are then provided in intervals of 50 down to 3500 counts hr \u22121 \u00d7 0.01, which is defined as the solar maximum and is the highest solar activity considered by the HKKM model. The factor of 0.01 is the common notation for NM data. From here on, we generally refer to the solar modulation effect as a \"relative normalization change\", taking the expected flux at solar minimum as the default normalization. In the figure, we see that only the neutrino flux up to around 1 GeV is strongly affected by the effect. It is also seen that there is a strong zenithdependence of the normalization change, which is due to the fact that neutrinos originating at the north and south polar regions reach the SK detector from below, and the polar regions are the areas of lowest rigidity cutoff on the Earth.",

While the correlation between each monitor is almost linear, we find that a small improvement in the \u03c7 2 /DOF can be obtained using a second-order polynomial fit; we therefore use second-order polynomials as the conversion functions between monitors. This nonlinearity is mostly due to the outlier events during particularly strong solar activity, where the assumption of uniformity in the neighborhood of the Earth may be less accurate. We then define a \"NM parameter\" C as the average of the four NM monitor values after conversion  to the equivalent Climax NM counts. This parameter is thus directly comparable to the Climax NM count, as used by the HKKM model. The combination of four monitors also reduces the influence of possible systematic shifts in a monitor; the systematic error on C is estimated by taking the average RMS of the four converted counts, and found to be 15.8 counts hr \u22121 \u00d7 0.01 at 1 \u03c3.

We thus analyse separately these time periods where C falls below 3300 counts hr \u22121 \u00d7 0.01. While no theoretical prediction of the fractional neutrino flux decrease is available here, these may be the most sensitive times to measure a solar effect on the atmospheric neutrino flux. We define a second search method by making a simple test against the null hypothesis, by counting the number of events observed during all such periods over all four data samples, and comparing with the nominal event rate, taken from the fitted normalization constants k s \u00d7 r s of the best-fit hypotheses in the long-term analysis.",
