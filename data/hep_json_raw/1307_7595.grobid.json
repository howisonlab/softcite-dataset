            "text": "The decay of the B \u00fe meson to the final state K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 receives contributions from tree level decays and decays mediated through virtual quantum loop processes. The tree level decays proceed through the decay of a B \u00fe meson to a vector c c resonance and a K \u00fe meson, followed by the decay of the resonance to a pair of muons. Decays mediated by flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) loop processes give rise to pairs of muons with a nonresonant mass distribution. To probe contributions to the FCNC decay from physics beyond the standard model (SM), it is essential that the tree level decays are properly accounted for. In all analyses of the B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 decay, from discovery [1] to the latest most accurate measurement [2], this has been done by placing a veto on the regions of dimuon mass m \u00fe \u00c0 dominated by the J=c and c \u00f02S\u00de resonances. In the low recoil region, corresponding to a dimuon mass above the open charm threshold, theoretical predictions of the decay rate can be obtained with an operator product expansion (OPE) [3] in which the c c contribution and other hadronic effects are treated as effective interactions.",

Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.

In the region from the J=c mass to 4600 MeV=c 2 the relative efficiency drops by around 20%. From there to the kinematic end point it drops sharply, predominantly due to the 2 IP cut on the kaon as in this region its direction is aligned with the B \u00fe candidate and therefore also with the PV. Initially, a fit with a single resonance in addition to the c \u00f03770\u00de and nonresonant terms is performed. This additional resonance has its phase, mean, and width left free. The parameters of the resonance returned by the fit are a mass of 4191 \u00fe9 \u00c08 MeV=c 2 and a width of 65 \u00fe22 \u00c016 MeV=c 2 .

The uncertainty on this product is calculated using the profile likelihood. The data are not sensitive to the vector fraction of the nonresonant component as the branching fraction of the resonance will vary to compensate. For example, if the vector fraction is lowered to 30%, the central value of the branching fraction increases to 4:6 \u00c2 10 \u00c09 . This reflects the lower amount of interference allowed between the resonant and nonresonant components.",

The resonance can be explained by the contribution of the c \u00f04160\u00de, via the decays B \u00fe ! c \u00f04160\u00deK \u00fe and c \u00f04160\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 . It constitutes first observations of both decays. The c \u00f04160\u00de is known to decay to electrons with a branching fraction of \u00f06:9 AE 4:0\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c06 [4]. Assuming lepton universality, the branching fraction of the decay B \u00fe ! c \u00f04160\u00deK \u00fe is measured to be \u00f05:1 \u00fe1:3 \u00c01:2 AE 3:0\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , where the second uncertainty corresponds to the uncertainty on the c \u00f04160\u00de ! e \u00fe e \u00c0 branching fraction. The corresponding limit for B \u00fe ! c \u00f04040\u00deK \u00fe is calculated to be 1:3 \u00f01:7\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 at a 90 (95)% confidence level. The absence of the decay B \u00fe ! c \u00f04040\u00deK \u00fe at a similar level is interesting, and suggests future studies of B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 decays based on larger data sets may reveal new insights into c c spectroscopy. The contribution of the c \u00f04160\u00de resonance in the low recoil region, taking into account interference with the nonresonant B \u00fe ! K \u00fe \u00fe \u00c0 decay, is about 20% of the total signal. This value is larger than theoretical estimates, where the c c contribution is $10% of the vector amplitude, with a small correction from quark-hadron duality violation [23]. Results presented in this Letter will play an important role in controlling charmonium effects in future inclusive and exclusive b ! s \u00fe \u00c0 measurements.",
