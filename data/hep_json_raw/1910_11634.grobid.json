A Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012 [10][11][12]. The best measurement of the Higgs boson mass to date, 125.26 \u00b1 0.21 GeV, comes from a partial Run 2 data set analysis by the CMS Collaboration [13]; the result is consistent with the earlier Run 1 combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [14] and the recent results by the ATLAS Collaboration [15]. The couplings of the observed boson have been studied extensively, and are found to be compatible with the SM expectation [16,17].",

A class of simple extensions of the SM, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), predicts the existence of five Higgs bosons [18,19]. Two of these five particles are CP-even Higgs bosons (h and H), and thus either of them could correspond to the observed particle. The properties of the observed state can be used to exclude regions of the parameter space of 2HDMs. Further constraints can be placed by performing searches for the four additional Higgs bosons, namely the scalar H, the CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 . Moreover, 2HDMs are a prerequisite for the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) where the extended Higgs sector at tree-level is fully defined by two parameters, conventionally chosen to be the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan \u03b2) and the mass of the pseudoscalar A (m A ).",

This is a reasonable assumption based on the nonobservation of supersymmetric particles at the CERN LHC thus far. In many of the MSSM benchmark scenarios typically studied, the predicted mass of the Higgs boson is lower than 125 GeV in the low tan \u03b2 region [20]. We study two MSSM benchmark scenarios that can accommodate these constraints in most of the m Atan \u03b2 plane: M 125 h,EFT [20] and hMSSM [21][22][23][24]. The Higgs sector predictions of the M 125 h,EFT scenario are derived from a 2HDM effective field theory framework, with a supersymmetric mass scale that can reach up to 10 16 GeV, in order for the Higgs boson mass to be compatible with 125 GeV in the low tan \u03b2 region. In the hMSSM scenario, by requiring m h = 125 GeV, the dominant radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass become fixed, which are then used to determine the masses and couplings of the other Higgs bosons.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [30]. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [31].",

The effect of inelastic collisions happening in the preceding and subsequent bunch crossings (out-of-time pileup) is also considered. The effect of pileup is taken into account by generating concurrent minimum bias collision events. The simulated events are weighted such that the distribution of the number of pileup interactions matches with that observed in data. The pileup distribution is estimated from the measured instantaneous luminosity for each bunch crossing, resulting in an average of approximately 23 interactions per bunch crossing.",

The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [84,86] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation studies so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets.

In case of the e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and e\u00b5 decay channels, tighter selection criteria are applied to the light leptons to decrease the background contributions from Z + jets and other reducible backgrounds. The specific signal selections detailed in table 2, including those chosen for the \u03c4 h candidates, were optimized to obtain the best signal sensitivity. The isolation requirements are I e(\u00b5) < 0.15 for electrons (muons) associated to a tau lepton decay. Electrons from tau lepton decays need to pass the electron identification which has an efficiency of 80%. The \u03c4 h candidates associated with the Higgs boson must satisfy the \u03c4 h identification and isolation requirements which have an efficiency of 70%.",

The requirements on the leptons associated with the Z boson are the same as defined in section 5, but they must fulfill a more stringent dilepton mass requirement, 81.2 < m < 120 GeV. After reconstructing the Z \u2192 decay, the jet-to-lepton misidentification rate is estimated by applying the lepton identification algorithm to the additional loosely defined lepton in the event. The misidentification rates are measured in different bins of lepton p T , and are further split between reconstructed decay modes for the \u03c4 h candidate, and for muons and electrons in bins of lepton \u03b7, based on the barrel and endcap regions. The events where the \u03c4 candidates arise from genuine tau leptons, electrons, or muons and not jets, primarily from the WZ process, are estimated from simulation and subtracted from data so that the misidentification rates are measured for genuine hadronic jets only.

In the hMSSM scenario, this search constrains the parameter space region with low tan \u03b2 values when 220 < m A < 350 GeV, and supports the results of previous indirect and direct searches. The combined measurements of the standard model Higgs boson couplings result in indirect constrains on the hMSSM scenario, that indicate that m A values below 600 GeV are disfavored by the observed data [16,17]. Out of the direct searches targeting the m A values below 400 GeV, this analysis has a similar sensitivity as the searches using the A \u2192 Zh(h \u2192 bb) decay, performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [27,28].

The sensitivity of the study is increased by using the information on the Higgs boson mass [13] when reconstructing the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson.
