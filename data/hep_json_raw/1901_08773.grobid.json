            "text": "To advance experimental efforts in the search for dark matter, physicists are now looking for new approaches. One such approach is to use a dish antenna to observe hidden photons (HPs) from cold dark matter (CDM) [1]. This technique has placed an upper limit on the HP mass of m \u03b3 = 3.1 \u00b1 1.2 eV [2]. This range of masses is limited by the coefficient of reflection of light from the mirror and by the spectral sensitivity of the photomultiplier tube. At higher frequencies, the light is absorbed by the reflecting surface, which results in a loss of sensitivity for this technique. However, the absorption of higher-frequency light causes the emission of electrons from the surface if the photon energy is higher than the work function of the metallic reflector. Hence, by counting single electrons emitted from the metal one can extend the sensitivity of this technique into the vacuum ultraviolet range and higher.",

Given these conditions, the value of \u03c7 obtained from (2.3) is only an upper limit. To improve the limit, we need to decrease the dark rate of the counter. One way to accomplish this would be to apply a surface treatment to diminish the effects of extraneous sources.

Using an Ar/CH 4 mixture enables us to lower the temperature to \u221240 \u2022 C, which can substantially reduce the thermionic dark rate. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of a multi-cathode counter. The counter is filled with an Ar + CH4 (10%) mixture at 1 bar. It has three cathodes and one anode made of goldplated tungsten-rhenium wire 25 \u00b5m in diameter. We apply the low (negative) potential HV1 to cathode 1, the outer cathode, which is fabricated from a metallic sheet, and we measure the counting rate of individual electrons emitted from the surface of this sheet. The second cathode is placed 5 mm from the outer cathode. It consists of a series of nichrome wires 50 \u00b5m in diameter, with a pitch of 4.5 mm. This cathode serves as a barrier to the electrons emitted from outer cathode. We apply the potential HV2 to cathode 2. In configuration 1, HV2 is higher than HV1, so that electrons emitted from cathode 1 can drift to the central counter with the still-smaller-diameter cathode 3, which is made of nichrome wires 50 \u00b5m in diameter, with a pitch of 6 mm. The smaller (40 mm) diameter of cathode 3 is used to obtain the high (\u2248 10 5 ) gas amplification needed to register the signal from single electrons. In configuration 2, the potential HV2 is lower than HV1, so that electrons emitted from the outer cathode are scattered back from cathode 2 and do not reach the central counter. We use this configuration to measure the dark rate due to electrons emitted from the wires and to ionising particles that cross the counter along short tracks at both ends. The two configurations have similar geometries and similar electric fields, so we expect that the difference R 1 \u2212 R 2 between the count rates measured in these two configurations measures the net effect due to electrons emitted from the outer cathode.  To reduce the background due to gamma radiation from the surrounding walls, we placed the counter in a special cabinet made of steel slabs 30 cm thick. We have measured the \u03b3-ray spectrum both inside and outside the shielding with a NaI(Tl)detector and the attenuation was obtained by comparing the two spectra. The attenuation of the gamma radiation by the shielding was greater than a factor of 100 for gamma rays at the \u2248 200 keV peak energy of the gamma-spectrum measured by a NaI(Tl) crystal. Measurements with the copper counter showed that with the counter placed outside the shield the count rate for single electrons was about 20% higher than the one obtained inside the shield. From here, we found that for the copper counter inside the shield the contribution to the single-electron count rate due to gamma radiation is less than 0.2% of the single-electron count rate. The given estimation of the remaining contribution from ambient gammas is a rough one like an order estimation. No events have been observed coincident with muons crossing the detector. The rate R M CC is obtained here as the difference R 1 \u2212 R 2 between the count rates in the two configurations, with different potentials at the second cathode [3]; see Figure 1. We assume that in configuration 1, the count rate is determined by the rate of emission of single electrons from the cathode of the counter, the wires and particles with short tracks crossing the counter at both ends (the end effect). In configuration 2, the rate is determined by the rate of emission from the wires and the end effect. The exact contributions of the end effect and the wires to the total count rate in configuration 2 is unknown for this technique. This uncertainty is the main source of our systematic error.",

This explains the relatively large uncertainty of these first measurements. Later measurements showed that after working continuously for about a month the instability disappeared.

Using (4.1) to account for the systematic uncertainties would substantially decrease the limits presented in this figure. The question of the relevant systematic uncertainty is now under further study. If we were to assume that electrons emitted from the cathode wires also contribute to the count rate, i.e. if we were to take into account our systematic errors, the curves for Cu-1, Cu-2 and Al-1 in figure 7 would be lower. An advanced surface treatment could further improve the sensitivity of the measurements.  Figure 7. Limits at a 95% CL obtained from the series of measurements Cu-1, Cu-2 and Al-1. Here the Tokyo limits are from [2] and the FUNK-1 limits from [10].",

            "text": "We have made good progress using a counter with an aluminium cathode. Further improvements can be made by using Ni or Pt, which have higher work functions, for the cathode of the counter. Figure 7 shows that our limits are higher than the limits given by the solar lifetime, so we still need to make significant improvements to go beyond these limits. However one should also take into account possible uncertainties due to two relevant processes: the emission of hidden photons inside the Sun and the emission of electrons from the metal surfaces. There is also a significant difference between volume and surface detectors. In the former, HPs are presumed to be detected by their interactions with valence electrons, while in the latter, detection is due to the interaction with free electrons in the degenerate electron gas. Our detector is a surface detector, so the limits obtained by this technique are related to the interaction of HPs with the free electrons in the degenerate electron gas of the metal.",
