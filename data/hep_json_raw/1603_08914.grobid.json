The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 fb \u22121 , at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The event selection requires at least two jets and no isolated leptons. The razor variables are used to quantify the transverse momentum balance in the jet momenta. The study is performed separately for events with and without jets originating from b quarks. The observed yields are consistent with the expected backgrounds and, depending on the nature of the production mechanism, dark matter production at the LHC is excluded at 90% confidence level for a mediator mass scale \u039b below 1 TeV. The use of razor variables yields results that complement those previously published.",

A global fit to cosmological data in the \u039bCDM model (also known as the standard model of cosmology) [12] suggests that approximately 85% of the mass of the universe is attributable to DM [10].",

In these models, pairs of DM particles can be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. Dark matter particles would not leave a detectable signal in a particle detector. When produced in association with high-energy quarks or gluons, they could provide event topologies with jets and a transverse momentum (p T ) imbalance ( p miss T ). The magnitude of p miss T is referred to as missing transverse energy (E miss T ). The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported searches for events with one high-p T jet and large E miss T [19,20], which are sensitive to such topologies. In this paper, we refer to these studies as monojet searches. Complementary studies of events with high-p T photons [21,22]; W, Z, or Higgs bosons [23][24][25][26]; b jets [27] and top quarks [27][28][29]; and leptons [30,31] have also been performed.",

The variable R 2 is designed to reduce QCD multijet background; it is correlated with the angle between the two jets, where co-linear jets have large R 2 while back-to-back jets have small R 2 . These variables have been used to study the production of non-interacting particles in cascade decays of heavier partners, such as squarks and gluinos in SUSY models with R-parity conservation [34,35]. The sensitivity of these variables to direct DM production was suggested in ref. [36], where it was pointed out that the dijet event topology provides good discrimination against background processes, with a looser event selection than that applied in the monojet searches. Sensitivity to DM production is most enhanced for large values of R 2 , while categorizing events based on the value of M R improves signal to background discrimination and yields significantly improved search sensitivity to a broader and more inclusive class of DM models. The resulting sensitivity is expected to be comparable to that of monojet searches [36,37]. This strategy also offers the possibility to search for DM particles that couple preferentially to b quarks [38], as proposed to accommodate the observed excess of photons with energies between 1 and 4 GeV in the gamma ray spectrum of the galactic center data collected by the Fermi-LAT -2 - gamma-ray space telescope [39]. The results are interpreted using an effective field theory approach and the Feynman diagrams for DM pair production are shown in figure 1. Unlike the SUSY razor searches [33,35], which focus on events with large values of M R , this study also considers events with small values of M R , using R 2 to discriminate between signal and background, in a kinematic region (R 2 > 0.5) excluded by the baseline selection of refs. [33,35].",

This and other special triggers were operated in 2012 to record events at a rate higher than the CMS computing system could process during data taking. The events from these triggers were stored on tape and their reconstruction was delayed until 2013, to profit from the larger availability of processing resources during the LHC shutdown. These data, referred to as \"parked data\" [40], enabled the exploration of events with small M R values, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to direct DM production.",

When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV [41]. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

The L1 jet triggers are based on the sums of transverse energy in regions \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 approximately 1.05\u00d71.05 in size [42] (where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in the plane transverse to the LHC beams.). At the HLT, energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL are clustered into jets and the razor variables R 2 and M R are computed. In the HLT, jets are defined using the FastJet [43] implementation of the anti-k T [44] algorithm, with a distance parameter equal to 0.5. Events with at least two jets with p T > 64 GeV are considered. Events are selected with R 2 > 0.09 and R 2 \u00d7 M R > 45 GeV. This selection rejects the majority of the background, which tends to have low R 2 and low M R values, while keeping the events in the signal-sensitive regions of the (M R , R 2 ) plane. The trigger efficiency, measured using a pre-scaled trigger with very loose thresholds, is shown in table 1. The requirements described above correspond to the least stringent event selection, given the constraints on the maximum acceptable rate. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated signal and background samples are generated with the leading order matrix element generator MadGraph v5.1.3 [45,46] and the CTEQ6L parton distribution function set [47]. The generation includes the pythia 6.4.26 [48] Z2* tune, which is derived from Z1 tune [49] based on the CTEQ5L set. Parton shower and hadronization effects are included by matching the generated events to pythia, using the MLM matching algorithm [50]. The events are processed with a Geant4 [51] description of the CMS apparatus to include detector effects. The simulation samples for SM background processes are scaled to the integrated luminosity of the data sample (18.8 fb \u22121 ), using calculations of the inclusive production cross sections at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the perturbative QCD expansion [52][53][54]. The signal processes corresponding to pair production of DM particles are simulated with up to two additional partons with p T > 80 GeV.",

Lepton isolation is defined as the scalar p T sum of all PF candidates other than the lepton itself, within a cone of size \u2206R = 0.3, and normalized to the lepton p T . A candidate is identified as a lepton if the isolation variable is found to be smaller than 15%.

These uncertainties are found to be typically \u224820-40%, depending on the considered bin in the (M R , R 2 ) plane, and are the dominant systematic uncertainties for the analysis. As discussed in section 6.1, a few bins at smaller values of R 2 exhibit larger systematic uncertainties, primarily due to statistical fluctuations in the control region. However the impact on the sensitivity to the dark matter models considered is small as the signal to background ratio is significantly better in other bins at larger values of R 2 . For the 0\u00b5 analysis, differences between the kinematic properties of W+jets and Z+jets events are additional sources of systematic uncertainty. These differences arise from the choice of the PDF set, jet energy scale corrections, b tagging efficiency corrections, and trigger efficiency. These effects largely cancel when taking the ratio of the two processes, and the resulting uncertainty is found to be smaller than one fifth of the total uncertainty.

Systematic uncertainties in the signal simulation originate from the choice of the PDF set, the jet energy scale correction, the modeling of the initial-state radiation in the event generator, and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity.

These effects are taken into account by propagating these uncertainties into the M R category and the R 2 bin. These uncertainties are considered to be fully correlated across M R categories and R 2 bins. Typical values for the individual contributions are given in table 10.

            "text": "The EFT framework provides a benchmark scenario to compare the sensitivity of this analysis with that of previous searches for similar signatures. However, the validity of an EFT approach is limited at the LHC because a fraction of events under study are generated at a \u221a\u015d comparable to the cutoff scale \u039b [68,[72][73][74]. For theories to be perturbative, g eff is typically required to be smaller than 4\u03c0, and this condition is unlikely to be satisfied for the entire region of phase space probed by the collider searches. In addition, the range of values for the couplings being probed within the EFT may be unrealistically large. Following the study presented in refs. [75][76][77], we quantify this effect through two EFT validity measures. The first is a minimal kinematic constraint on \u039b obtained by requiring Q tr < g eff \u039b and Q tr > 2M \u03c7 , where Q tr is the momentum transferred from the mediator to the DM particle pair, which yields \u039b > 2M \u03c7 /g eff . The second is more stringent and uses the quantity:  Figure 7. Lower limit at 90% CL on the cutoff scale \u039b as a function of the DM mass M \u03c7 in the case of axial-vector (left) and vector (right) currents. The validity of the EFT is quantified by R \u039b = 80% contours, corresponding to different values of the effective coupling g eff . For completeness, regions forbidden by the EFT validity condition \u039b > 2M \u03c7 /g eff are shown for two choices of the effective coupling: g eff = 1 (light gray) and g eff = 4\u03c0 (dark gray).",

The results are presented as exclusion limits on dark matter production at 90% confidence level for models based on effective operators and for different assumptions on the interaction between the dark matter particles and the colliding partons. Dark matter production at the LHC is excluded for a mediator mass scale \u039b below 1 TeV in the case of a vector or axial vector operator. While the sensitivity achieved is similar to those of previously published searches, this analysis complements those results since the use of razor variables provides more inclusive selection criteria and since the exploitation of parked data allows events with small values of M R to be included.",
