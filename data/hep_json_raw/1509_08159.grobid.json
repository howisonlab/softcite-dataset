            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2012 [1][2][3] opened a new field for exploration in particle physics. The Higgs boson was discovered through its direct coupling to other known heavy bosons (W, Z) and its indirect coupling to photons, which in the standard model (SM) occurs via a loop involving W bosons or top quarks. Strong evidence for the Higgs boson coupling to fermions has also been established [4,5]. Moreover, there is evidence of the Higgs boson coupling to bottom quarks from the Tevatron [6] and from CMS [7], and to tau leptons from ATLAS [5] and CMS [8]. It is now critical to test whether the observed Higgs boson is the SM Higgs boson by studying its coupling to other elementary particles.",

            "text": "The coupling of the new boson to the top quark is of special interest. Because of its very large mass [9] the top quark is widely believed to play a special role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Physics beyond the SM could modify the top quark Yukawa coupling without violating current experimental constraints. The most straightforward way to study this coupling is through the measurement of top quark-antiquark pair production in association with a Higgs boson (ttH), as was recently done by ATLAS and CMS [10][11][12][13]. Interactions of the Higgs boson with the top quark can also be probed by studying the associated production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson, which proceeds mainly through t-channel diagrams (tHq) [14] in which the Higgs boson is emitted either from an internally exchanged W boson or from a top quark, as shown in figure 1. The associated single top quark and Higgs boson production can also be accompanied by a W in the final state (tHW). As the couplings of the Higgs boson to the W boson and the top quark have opposite signs in the SM, these two diagrams interfere destructively. The cross section for single top quark plus Higgs boson production via the tHq process in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV has been calculated to be about 18 fb at next-to-leading-order (NLO) [15].",

            "text": "Anomalous coupling of the Higgs boson to SM particles would modify the expected rate of tHq events [16]. A number of models have been proposed that would modify the interference between the diagrams involving ttH and WWH couplings. For example, a negative coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark (C t = \u22121) would give rise to about a 15-fold increase in the tHq cross section. Recent work suggests the investigation of anomalous tHq production in events with a pair of photons [17,18], b quarks [15], or multiple leptons in the final state [18]. The same interference probes the CP-violating phase of the top quark Yukawa coupling [19][20][21]. Also, a large rate of single top quark plus Higgs boson events could signal the direct production of heavy new particles as predicted in composite and little Higgs models [22], or new physics showing up as Higgs boson mediated flavor changing neutral currents [23]. The apparent exclusion of the C t = \u22121 case based on the value of the branching fraction for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 only holds under the assumption that no new particles contribute to the loop in the main diagram for that decay [24]. This paper reports the first search for tHq production, focusing on the scenario where the coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark has a sign opposite to that predicted -2 -JHEP06(2016)177 by the SM, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Four Higgs boson decay modes are explored. Section 2 describes the CMS detector, the reconstruction algorithms, and the simulated samples. Section 3 outlines the selection, background modeling, and signal extraction techniques for analyses based on H decay channels with photons, hadrons, and multiple leptons. Section 4 describes the systematic uncertainties affecting the search results. Finally, the procedure for combining the results of the searches is presented in section 5. The results are summarized in section 6.",

A quartz-fiber forward calorimeter extends the coverage further up to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

The superclustering algorithms achieve an almost complete reconstruction of the energy of photons (and electrons) that convert into electron-positron pairs (emit bremsstrahlung) in the material in front of the ECAL. The photon candidates are identified within the ECAL fiducial region |\u03b7| < 2.5, excluding the barrel-endcap transition region 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.57, where photon reconstruction is suboptimal. Isolation requirements are applied to photon candidates by looking at neighboring particle candidates. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of about 1.3% up to a pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| = 1, rising to about 2.5% at |\u03b7| = 1.4. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3 and 4%. Additional details on photon reconstruction and identification can be found in refs. [28,29].",

The presence of exactly one isolated electron or muon with p T > 10 GeV and at least one b quark jet with p T > 20 GeV are required to identify the leptonic decay of the top quark. If more than one jet is b tagged, the one with the largest transverse momentum is chosen as the b jet candidate from the top quark decay. Finally, the highest p T jet in the event that is not b tagged must have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| > 1.",

Signatures resulting from leptonic JHEP06(2016)177 top quark decay and different decay modes of the Higgs boson have been analyzed. In particular, the searches have been optimized for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, H \u2192 bb, H \u2192 WW, and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay modes. The results are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. A 95% confidence level limit on the production cross section of a single top quark plus a Higgs boson with a non-standard-model coupling is set ranging from 600 to 1000 fb depending on the assumed diphoton branching fraction of the Higgs boson. This is the first time that results on anomalous tHq production have been reported. These results can be combined with other Higgs boson measurements to constrain the coupling of the Higgs boson to SM quarks; they can also be used to probe new physics modifying the top-Higgs couplings. The 13 TeV LHC run will allow a precise determination of both the magnitude and the sign of the top quark Yukawa coupling.",
