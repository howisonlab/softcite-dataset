            "text": "Fluctuations of dynamical nature were observed for the first time in the JACEE event [1] having unusually very high multiplicity. The study of non-statistical fluctuations has since then attracted a great deal of attention of high energy physicists due to possibility of disentangling some important information about the mechanism of multiparticle production in relativistic hadronic and nuclear collisions. It has been observed [2] [3] that large particle density fluctuations in small rapidity bins exhibit self-similar behaviour. However, the origin of multifractality still remains largely unexplained. Self-similar behaviour of particles produced is closely linked to multifractality, which is a consequence of cascading mechanism of particle production in these collisions. Power-law behaviour of Scaled Factorial Moments indeed exhibits fractal patterns [4]  [5] in the multiparticle dynamics of the final state of the collisions. Therefore, the issue of self-similarity under the perspective of fractal properties of the hadronic matter in multiparticle production needs to be adequately addressed. To investigate quantitatively any single particle density distribution in the framework of multifractal characteristics, a method has been developed [6]. This method has been successively applied in studying intermittent behaviour of particle density distributions over a wide range of pseudorapidity bin widths. In the present study, an attempt is made to investigate multifractal characteristics of the secondary particles produced in 14.5A GeV/c 28 Si-nucleus collisions.",
