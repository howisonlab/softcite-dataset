The most recent measurements are from the ATLAS [9, 10], CMS [11][12][13][14][15][16][17], and LHCb [18][19][20] Collaborations at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies at 7 and 8 TeV.

[33], where one muon is identified with stringent quality requirements and the second muon is identified using information either from the tracker (to measure the trigger and muon identification efficiencies) or from the external muon system (to measure the silicon tracker efficiency). These efficiencies are compared to those from simulation studies, in bins of muon p T and \u03b7, and are found to agree within their uncertainties.
