If the result is confirmed as being due to direct CP violation at the 1% level, its effect will need to be taken into account in the interpretation of CP violation observables. The contributions of direct and indirect CP violation to the decay rate asymmetry difference \u2206A CP and the ratios of effective lifetimes A \u0393 and y CP are considered here. Terms relevant to the interpretation of future high precision measurements which have been neglected in previous literature are identified.",

While neutral B mesons are characterised by their mass splitting leading to fast oscillations and neutral kaons by their width splitting which results in a short-lived and a long-lived state, neutral charm mesons have a very small splitting in both mass and width. For charm, compared to the beauty sector, this leads to rather subtle mixing-related effects in time-dependent as well as in time-integrated charm measurements, which are examined in detail here.",

This measurement is primarily sensitive to the difference in direct CP violation between the two final states as discussed further below. Direct CP violation depends on the final state and is the asymmetry of the rates of particle and antiparticle decays. It can be caused by a difference in the magnitude of the decay rates or by a difference in their phase. Indirect CP violation is considered universal, i.e. final-state independent, and is an asymmetry in the mixing rate or in its weak phase.",

One uses the asymmetry of the lifetimes, A \u0393 , measured in D 0 and D 0 decays to the CP eigenstates K + K \u2212 or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [2,3,4]. The other is a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis of D 0 and D 0 decays to 5,6]. Another observable studied related to A \u0393 is y CP , which is given by the deviation from one of the ratio of the lifetimes measured in decays to a Cabibbo-allowed, CP averaged, and a Cabibbosuppressed, CP eigenstate, final state. Any deviation of a measurement of y CP from that of the mixing parameter y would signal CP violation.",

The parameter y CP is least affected by direct CP violation, however, it contains a term which has been neglected in the literature so far and which can be of the same order as the constribution proportional to x. A measurement of A \u0393 can exhibit a contribution of direct CP violation at the level of 10 \u22124 , comparable to the expected future experimental sensitivity. The direct CP violation term in the \u2206A CP measurement contains a contribution proportional to y. The interpretation of future high precision measurements of these observables will need to take account of these contributions.",
