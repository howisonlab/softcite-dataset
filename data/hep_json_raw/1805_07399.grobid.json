The measurement is performed using events with one electron and one muon in the final state along with at least one jet originated from a bottom quark. A multivariate discriminant, exploiting the kinematic properties of the events, is used to separate the signal from the dominant tt background. The measured cross section of 63.1 \u00b1 1.8(stat) \u00b1 6.4(syst) \u00b1 2.1 (lumi) pb is in agreement with the standard model expectation.",

The first uncertainty refers to the factorization (\u00b5 F ) and renormalization (\u00b5 R ) scales in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the second to parton distribution functions (PDFs). The quoted cross section includes the charge-conjugate modes. The leading-order (LO) Feynman diagrams for tW production are shown in figure 1. This paper reports the first measurement from the CMS Collaboration of tW production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The measurement uses data recorded by CMS during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 \u00b1 0.9 fb \u22121 . The analysis is performed using the e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 dilepton channel, in which both W bosons, either produced in association with the top quark or from the decay of the top quark, decay leptonically into a muon or an electron ( ), and a neutrino. Events with W bosons decaying into \u03c4 leptons that decay into electrons or muons also contribute to the measurement. The primary background to tW production in this final state comes from tt production, with Drell-Yan (DY) production of \u03c4 lepton pairs that decay leptonically being the next most significant background. To extract the signal, the analysis uses a multivariate technique, exploiting kinematic observables to distinguish the tW signal from the dominant tt background.",

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and on average is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to correct for the remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections, derived from simulation, are applied so that the average response to jets matches the particle level jets [37]. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, pho-ton+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale (JES) between data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied JHEP10 (2018)117to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures. Jets are required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. In order to avoid double counting, jets within a cone of \u2206R = 0.4 with respect to the selected leptons are not considered.
