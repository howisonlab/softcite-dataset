The measurement was performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 and the 2012 8 TeV dataset of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The numbers of events with exactly one and exactly two b-tagged jets were counted and used to simultaneously determine \u03c3 tt and the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section was measured to be: \u03c3 tt = 182.9 \u00b1 3.1 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b1 3.3 pb ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) and \u03c3 tt = 242.4 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 5.5 \u00b1 7.5 \u00b1 4.2 pb ( \u221a s = 8 TeV), = 172.9 +2.5 \u22122.6 GeV. By looking for an excess of tt production with respect to the QCD prediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production of supersymmetric top squarkst 1 with masses close to the top quark mass, decaying viat 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino\u03c7 0 1 , the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 177 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.",

The study of its production and decay properties forms a core part of the ATLAS physics programme at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the LHC, top quarks are primarily produced in quark-antiquark pairs (tt), and the precise prediction of the corresponding inclusive cross-section (\u03c3 tt ) is a substantial challenge for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculational techniques. Precise measurements of \u03c3 tt are sensitive to the gluon parton distribution function (PDF), the top quark mass, and potential enhancements of the cross-section due to physics beyond the Standard Model.",

The rates of events with an e\u03bc pair and one or two tagged b-jets were used to measure simultaneously the tt production cross-section and the combined probability to reconstruct and b-tag a jet from a top quark decay.

At a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV and assuming m t = 172.5 GeV, these calculations give a prediction of 177.3 \u00b1 9.0 +4.6 \u22126.0 pb, where the first uncertainty is due to PDF and \u03b1 s uncertainties, and the second to QCD scale uncertainties. The corresponding prediction at \u221a s = 8 TeV is 252.9 \u00b1 11.7 +6.4 \u22128.6 pb. These values were calculated using the top++ 2.0 program [7]. The PDF and \u03b1 s uncertainties were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [8] with the MSTW2008 68 % CL NNLO [9,10], CT10 NNLO [11,12] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [13] PDF sets, and added in quadrature to the QCD scale uncertainty. The latter was obtained from the envelope of predictions with the renormalisation and factorisation scales varied independently by factors of two up and down from their default values of m t , whilst never letting them differ by more than a factor of two. The ratio of cross-sections at \u221a s = 8 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV is predicted to be 1.430 \u00b1 0.013 (PDF+\u03b1 s ) \u00b10.001 (QCD scale).

The first category with two prompt leptons includes W t single top production, modelled using Powheg + Pythia6 [33] with the CT10 PDFs and the P2011C tune; Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 +jets modelled using Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) or Alpgen + Pythia6 including LO matrix elements for Zbb production, with CTEQ6L1 PDFs; and diboson (W W , W Z, Z Z) production in association with jets, modelled using Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy. The W t background was normalised to approximate NNLO cross-sections of 15.7 \u00b1 1.2 pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 22.4 \u00b1 1.5 pb at \u221a s = 8 TeV, determined as in Ref. [34]. The inclusive Z cross-sections were set to the NNLO predictions from FEWZ [35], but the normalisation of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc4\u03bd backgrounds with b-tagged jets were determined from data as described in Sect. 5.1. The diboson background was normalised to the NLO QCD inclusive cross-section predictions calculated with MCFM [36]. Production of tt in association with a W or Z boson, which contributes to the sample with same-sign leptons, was simulated with Madgraph [37] interfaced to Pythia with CTEQ6L1 PDFs, and normalised to NLO cross-section predictions [38,39].",

Jets were calibrated using an energy-and \u03b7-dependent simulation-based calibration scheme, with in-situ corrections based on data, and were required to satisfy p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To suppress the contribution from low-p T jets originating from pileup interactions, a jet vertex fraction requirement was applied: at \u221a s = 7 TeV jets were required to have at least 75 % of the scalar sum of the p T of tracks associated with the jet coming from tracks associated with the event primary vertex. The latter was defined as the reconstructed vertex with the highest sum of associated track p 2 T . Motivated by the higher pileup background, in the \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset this requirement was loosened to 50 %, only applied to jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and the effects of pileup on the jet energy calibration were further reduced using the jet-area method as described in Ref. [48]. Finally, to further suppress non-isolated leptons likely to have come from heavy-flavour decays inside jets, electrons and muons within \u0394R = 0.4 of selected jets were also discarded.",

This scaling eliminates uncertainties due to the simulation modelling of jets (especially heavy-flavour jets) produced in association with the Z bosons. The data-to-simulation ratios were measured in events with exactly two opposite-sign electrons or muons passing the selections given in Sect. 4 and one or two b-tagged jets, by fitting the dilepton invariant mass distributions in the range 60-120 GeV, accounting for the backgrounds from tt production and misidentified leptons.

The prediction for e\u03bc was found to be particularly sensitive to the amount of hadronic activity near the leptons, which strongly affects the efficiency of the lepton isolation requirements described in Sect. 4. These isolation efficiencies were therefore measured directly from data, as discussed below. The remaining uncertainties on e\u03bc relating to lepton reconstruction, identification and lepton-jet overlap removal, were evaluated from the differences between the predictions from the baseline Powheg + Pythia tt sample and a sample generated using MC@NLO + Herwig, thus varying both the hard-scattering event generator and the fragmentation and hadronisation model. The MC@NLO + Herwig sample gave a larger value of e\u03bc but a smaller value of C b . Additional comparisons of Powheg + Pythia samples with the AUET2 rather than P2011C tune and with Powheg + Herwig, i.e. changing only the fragmentation/hadronisation model, gave smaller uncertainties. The Alpgen + Herwig and Alpgen + Pythia samples gave values of e\u03bc up to 2 % higher than that of Powheg+Pythia, due largely to a more central predicted \u03b7 distribution for the leptons. However, this sample uses a leading-order generator and PDFs, and gives an inferior description of the electron and muon \u03b7 distributions (see Fig. 3c, e), so was not used to set the systematic uncertainty on e\u03bc . In contrast, the Alpgen samples were considered in setting the uncertainty on C b , taken as the largest difference between the predictions of Powheg + Pythia and any of the other generators.",

These samples predicted large variations in the lepton isolation efficiencies (which were instead measured from data), but residual variations in other lepton-related uncertainties and C b within the uncertainties set from other simulation samples. Parton distribution functions: The uncertainties on e\u03bc , C b and the W t single top background due to uncertainties on the proton PDFs were evaluated using the error sets of the CT10 NLO [11], MSTW 2008 68 % CL NLO [9,10] and NNPDF 2.3 NLO [13] sets. The final uncertainty was calculated as half the envelope encompassing the predictions from all three PDF sets along with their associated uncertainties, following the PDF4LHC recommendations [8]. QCD scale choices: The lepton p T and \u03b7 distributions, and hence e\u03bc , are sensitive to the choices of QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales. This effect was investigated using \u221a s = 8 TeV generator-level Powheg + Pythia tt samples where the two scales were separately varied up and down by a factor of two from their default values of Q 2 =m t 2 + p 2 T,t . The systematic uncertainty for each scale was taken as half the difference in e\u03bc values between the samples with increased and decreased QCD scale, and the uncertainties for the renormalisation The simulation prediction is normalised to the same integrated luminosity as the data, and broken down into contributions where both leptons are prompt, or one is a misidentified lepton from a photon conversion originating from a top quark decay or from background, or from heavy-flavour decay. In the p T distributions, the last bin includes the overflows and factorisation scales were then added linearly to give a total scale uncertainty of 0.30 % on e\u03bc , assumed to be valid for both centre-of-mass energies. Single top modelling: Uncertainties related to W t single top modelling were assessed by comparing the predictions from Powheg + Pythia, Powheg + Herwig, MC@NLO + Herwig, and AcerMC + Pythia with two tunes producing different amounts of additional radiation, in all cases normalising the total production rate to the approximate NNLO cross-section prediction. The resulting uncertainties are about 5 % and 20 % on the one and two b-tag background contributions. The background in the two b-tag sample is sensitive to the production of W t with an additional b-jet, a NLO contribution to W t which can interfere with the tt final state. The sensitivity to this interference was studied by comparing the predictions of Powheg with the diagram-removal (baseline) and diagram-subtraction schemes [33,52], giving additional single-top/tt interference uncertainties of 1-2 % and 20 % for the one and two b-tag samples. The production of single top quarks in association with a Z boson gives contributions which are negligible compared to the above uncertainties. Production of single top quarks via the t-and s-channels gives rise to final states with only one prompt lepton, and is accounted for as part of the misidentified-lepton background. Background cross-sections: The uncertainties on the W t single top cross-section were taken to be 7.6 % and 6.8 % at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV, based on Ref. [34]. The uncertainties on the diboson cross-sections were set to 5 % [36].  Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events result from statistical uncertainties, comparing the results from ee and \u03bc\u03bc, which have different background compositions, and considering the dependence of the scale factors on Z boson p T . Lepton identification and measurement: The modelling of the electron and muon identification efficiencies, energy scales and resolutions (including the effects of pileup) were studied using Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc, J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc and W \u2192 e\u03bd events in data and simulation, using the techniques described in Refs. [42,43,53]. Small corrections were applied to the simulation to better model the performance seen in data, and the associated systematic uncertainties were propagated to the cross-section measurement.",

            "text": "Lepton isolation: The efficiency of the lepton isolation requirements was measured directly in data, from the fraction of selected opposite-sign e\u03bc events with one or two b-tags where either the electron or muon fails the isolation cut. The results were corrected for the contamination from misidentified leptons, estimated using the same-sign e\u03bc samples as described in Sect. 5, or by using the distributions of lepton impact parameter significance |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 , where d 0 is the distance of closest approach of the lepton track to the event primary vertex in the transverse plane, and \u03c3 d 0 its uncertainty. Consistent results were obtained from both methods, and showed that the baseline Powheg+Pythia simulation overestimates the efficiencies of the isolation requirements by about 0.5 % for both the electrons and muons. These corrections were applied to e\u03bc , with uncertainties dominated by the limited sizes of the same-sign and high impact-parameter significance samples used for background estimation. Similar results were found from studies in Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events, after correcting the results for the larger average amount of hadronic activity near the leptons in tt \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bdbb events. Jet-related uncertainties: Although the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag jets from tt events is extracted from the data, uncertainties in the jet energy scale, energy resolution and reconstruction efficiency affect the backgrounds estimated from simulation and the estimate of the tagging correlation C b . They also have a small effect on e\u03bc via the lepton-jet \u0394R separation cuts. The jet energy scale was varied in simulation according to the uncertainties derived from simulation and in-situ calibration measurements [47,54], using a model with 21 ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) or 22 ( \u221a s = 8 TeV) separate orthogonal uncertainty components which were then added in quadrature. The jet energy resolution was found to be well modelled by simulation [55], and remaining uncertainties were assessed by applying additional smearing, which reduces e\u03bc . The calorimeter jet reconstruction efficiency was measured in data using track-based jets, and is also well described by the simulation; the impact of residual uncertainties was assessed by randomly discarding jets. The uncertainty associated with the jet vertex fraction requirement was assessed from studies of Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc+jets events. b -tagging uncertainties: The efficiency for b-tagging jets from tt events was extracted from the data via Eq. 1, but simulation was used to predict the number of b-tagged jets and mistagged light-quark, gluon and charm jets in the W t single top and diboson backgrounds. The tagging correlation C b is also slightly sensitive to the efficiencies for tagging heavy-and light-flavour jets. The uncertainties in the simulation modelling of the b-tagging performance were assessed using studies of b-jets containing muons [50,56], jets containing D * + mesons [57] and inclusive jet events [58]. Misidentified leptons: The uncertainties on the number of events with misidentified leptons in the one and two b-tagged samples were derived from the statistical uncertainties on the numbers of same-sign lepton events, the systematic uncertainties on the opposite-to same-sign ratios R j , and the uncertainties on the numbers of prompt same-sign events, as discussed in detail in Sect. 5.1. The overall uncertainties on the numbers of misidentified leptons vary from 30 to 50 %, dominated by the uncertainties on the ratios R j . Integrated luminosity: The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity of the \u221a s = 7 TeV dataset is 1.8 % [59]. Using beam-separation scans performed in November 2012, the same methodology was applied to determine the \u221a s = 8 TeV luminosity scale, resulting in an uncertainty of 2.8 %. These uncertainties are dominated by effects specific to each dataset, and so are considered to be uncorrelated between the two centre-of-mass energies. The relative uncertainties on the cross-section measurements are slightly larger than those on the luminosity measurements because the W t single top and diboson backgrounds are evaluated from simulation, so are also sensitive to the assumed integrated luminosity. LHC beam energy: The LHC beam energy during the 2012 pp run was calibrated to be 0.30 \u00b1 0.66 % smaller than the nominal value of 4 TeV per beam, using the revolution frequency difference of protons and lead ions during p+Pb runs in early 2013 [60]. Since this calibration is compatible with the nominal \u221a s of 8 TeV, no correction was applied to the measured \u03c3 tt value. However, an uncertainty of 1.72 %, corresponding to the expected change in \u03c3 tt for a 0.66 % change in \u221a s is quoted separately on the final result. This uncertainty was calculated using top++ 2.0, assuming that the relative change of \u03c3 tt for a 0.66 % change in \u221a s is as predicted by the NNLLO+NNLL calculation. Following Ref. [60], the same relative uncertainty on the LHC beam energy is applied for the \u221a s = 7 TeV dataset, giving a slightly larger uncertainty of 1.79 % due to the steeper relative dependence of \u03c3 tt on \u221a s in this region. These uncertainties are much larger than those corresponding to the very small dependence of e\u03bc on \u221a s, which changes by only 0.5 % between 7 and 8 TeV.",

Additional studies were carried out to probe the modelling of possible sources of correlation.

These effects were probed by increasing the jet p T cut in steps from the default of 25 GeV up to 75 GeV; above about 50 GeV, the simulation predicts strong positive correlations of up to C b \u2248 1.2 for a 75 GeV p T cut. As shown for the \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset in Fig. 5, the cross-sections fitted in data after taking these correlations into account remain stable across the full p T cut range, suggesting that any such kinematic correlations are well modelled by the simulation. Similar results were seen at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The results were also found to be stable within the uncorrelated components of the statistical and systematic uncertainties when tightening the jet and lepton \u03b7 cuts, raising the lepton p T cut up to 55 GeV and changing the b-tagging working point between efficiencies of 60 % and 80 %. No additional uncertainties were assigned as a result of these studies.",

The same set of experimental uncertainties was considered correlated as for the cross-section ratio measurement, and the uncertainty on \u03c3 theo tt was considered fully correlated between the two datasets. The resulting value using the envelope of all three considered PDF sets is m pole t = 172.9 +2.5 \u22122.6 GeV and has only a slightly smaller uncertainty than the individual results at each centre-of-mass energy, due to the large correlations, particularly for the theoretical predictions. The results are shown in Fig. 8, together with previous determinations using similar techniques from D0 [71,72] and CMS [73]. All extracted values are consistent with the average of measurements from kinematic reconstruction of tt events of 173.34 \u00b1 0.76 GeV [74], showing good compatibility of top quark masses extracted using very different techniques and assumptions.",

Due to the rapidly decreasing stop-pair production cross-section with increasing mt 1 , the analysis is most sensitive below 180 GeV. Adopting the convention of reducing the estimated SUSY production crosssection by one standard deviation of its theoretical uncertainty (15 %, coming from PDFs and QCD scale uncertainties [90]), stop masses between the top mass threshold and 177 GeV are excluded, assuming 100 % branching ratio for t 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 and m\u03c70 1 = 1 GeV. The limits from considering the \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV datasets separately are only slightly weaker, due to the large correlations in the systematic uncertainties between beam energies, particularly for the theoretical predictions. At each energy, they correspond to excluded stop-pair production cross-sections of 25-27 pb at 95 % CL. The combined cross-section limits depend only slightly on the neutralino mass, becoming e.g. about 3 % weaker at mt 1 = 200 GeV for m\u03c70 1 = 20 GeV. However, they depend more strongly on the assumed top quark polarisation; in a scenario with mt 1 = 175 GeV and m\u03c70 1 = 1 GeV, and squark mixing matrices chosen such that the top quarks are produced with full left-handed polarisation, the limits are 4 % weaker than the predominantly right-handed case, rising to 14 % weaker for mt 1 = 200 GeV. In this scenario, top squarks with masses from m t to 175 GeV can be excluded. Although the analysis has some sensitivity to three-body top squark decays of the formt 1 \u2192 bW\u03c7 0 1 for mt 1 < m t , the b-jets become softer than those from SM tt production, affecting the determination of b . Therefore, no limits are set for scenarios with mt 1 < m t .",
