            "text": "The invariant mass distribution of the two-lepton system can exhibit an excess that increases with the dilepton mass, followed by a sharp decrease and thus an \"edge\", if the two leptons originate from the decay of an on-shell heavy neutral particle. This kind of signature is fairly generic for models of physics beyond the SM (BSM), assumes an isotropic decay, and is purely kinematic in origin. In models of supersymmetry (SUSY) [2], an edge with a triangular shape is expected in the cascade process \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 + \u2212 [3], where \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 are respectively the next-to-lightest and lightest neutralino, with a selectron or smuon, the SUSY partners of an electron or muon. Alternatively, the \u03c7 0 2 can undergo a three-body decay to \u03c7 0 1 + \u2212 through a virtual Z * boson, also yielding an edge in the dilepton JHEP04 (2015)124mass spectrum but with a more rounded shape. Another possibility is the decay of a \u03c7 0 2 to an on-shell Z boson, \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 Z. This latter process does not produce an edge but rather a dilepton mass peak near 91 GeV. These processes arise as a consequence of the gaugecoupling structure of SUSY and are a characteristic feature of SUSY decay chains. Their relative importance depends on the SUSY mass hierarchy and is thus model dependent.",

Two specific possibilities are considered. In the first scenario (figure 1 left), the \u03c7 0 2 decays to an off-shell Z boson Z * and the \u03c7 0 1 neutralino, where the \u03c7 0 1 is a stable, weakly interacting, lightest SUSY particle (LSP).

The leptons are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity [1]. In events with more than two selected leptons, we choose the two oppositely charged leptons with highest p T . The background estimation techniques employed in this analysis rely, in part, on a symmetry between lepton pairs with the same flavor compared to those with opposite flavor (OF), where OF refers to e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 combinations. It is therefore desirable that the reconstruction efficiencies of electrons [23] and muons [24] be as similar as possible. For this reason, we exclude leptons in the intervals 1.4 < |\u03b7| < 1.6 between the barrel and endcap regions of the detector [1], where the electron and muon reconstruction efficiencies differ significantly. For the SF signal candidate sample, only events with an e + e \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair are used.",

The OF yields are multiplied by a factor R SF/OF to account for efficiency differences in the selection of dilepton pairs in the SF and OF samples. Two methods are used to evaluate the R SF/OF factor, as explained below. We also determine corresponding factors R ee/OF and R \u00b5\u00b5/OF for the individual SF terms. The first method, referred to as the \"factorization\" method, uses a data control sample to determine the SF-to-OF ratio of reconstruction efficiencies, and a second data control sample to determine the corresponding ratio of trigger efficiencies. The reconstruction efficiency ratio is evaluated using a large DY + jets data control sample selected by requiring 60 < m < 120 GeV, N jets \u2265 2, and E miss T < 50 GeV. The measured quantity is r \u00b5e = N \u00b5\u00b5 /N ee , which represents a ratio of the muon-to-electron reconstruction efficiency uncorrected for trigger efficiencies. The extrapolation of r \u00b5e into the central (forward) signal region is studied using data. A 10% (20%) systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for the observed dependencies. The ratio R T of the trigger efficiencies in SF and OF events is determined using a data control sample selected with a trigger based on H T , which is the scalar sum of jet p T values for jets with p T > 40 GeV. The sample is selected by requiring H T > 200 GeV, m > 20 GeV, and excluding events with N jets = 2 and E miss T > 100 GeV. The latter two requirements ensure that this control sample is uncorrelated with the control sample used to determine the reconstruction efficiencies. A 5% uncertainty is assigned to the efficiency of each dilepton trigger (e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ) to account for the observed dependence of these efficiencies on m , E miss T , and N jets . The full correction to the OF event rate is R SF/OF = 0.5(r \u00b5e + r \u22121 \u00b5e )R T , with R T = trig ee trig \u00b5\u00b5 / trig e\u00b5 . The second method, referred to as the \"control-region\" method, directly measures the R SF/OF factors from the ratio of the e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , or combined SF yields with the OF -7 -JHEP04 2015 yields in a tt-dominated control region with N jets \u2265 2, 100 < E miss T < 150 GeV, and 20 < m < 70 GeV. Differences between the factors obtained in this control region and in the signal regions are studied with the tt simulation. No difference is observed within the MC statistical uncertainty, which is used to define the corresponding systematic uncertainty. The size of this uncertainty is found to be 2% (3-4%) in the central (forward) region.",

It is seen that the values of the R SF/OF ratios are consistent with unity within the uncertainties.

For the counting experiment method, the DY background is determined using the jet-Z balance (JZB) and E miss T -template methods [5], as described in this section. The JZB is a measure of the imbalance between the p T of the Z/\u03b3 * boson and the p T of the recoiling hadronic system in DY + jets. The JZB is defined as the scalar difference between the p T of the Z/\u03b3 * and the net p T of the recoiling hadronic system. Standard model DY + jets events equally populate negative and positive values of JZB, because non-zero JZB in these events arises from jet energy resolution effects, whereas in BSM and tt events, which contain genuine E miss T , JZB can be very asymmetric towards positive values because of the correlated production of the lepton pair and the undetected particles. Events with negative values of JZB mainly arise from DY + jets processes, with a small contribution from tt production. The number of tt events that contribute negative JZB values is determined using the corresponding results for OF events. The tt contribution is then subtracted from the number of negative JZB events in the SF sample to estimate the DY+jets background. Uncertainties arising from imperfect knowledge of the R SF/OF factor (table 1) when subtracting the tt contribution are propagated to the final DY + jets estimate. This method also accounts for processes with DY\u2192 \u00b1 \u2213 + X, where X denotes other particles that might be present in the final state. The systematic uncertainty in the assumption that DY + jets events equally populate positive and negative values of JZB is evaluated in simulation by comparing the E miss T distributions of events with JZB < 0 and >0. A systematic uncertainty of 20% is assigned to account for possible differences, dominated by the limited statistical precision of the MC sample.",

For both DY + jets and \u03b3 + jets events, large values of E miss T arise from the mismeasurement of jet p T values. The E miss T distribution for DY + jets events can thus be evaluated using \u03b3 + jets events selected with similar kinematic requirements. After selection, the N jets , H T , and boson p T distributions of the \u03b3 + jets sample are reweighted to match those of the DY + jets sample. The systematic uncertainty is determined in simulation by applying this reweighting to a \u03b3 + jets MC sample and comparing the reweighted E miss T spectrum to that in a DY + jets MC sample. The uncertainty is taken as the larger of the difference between the two samples or the MC statistical uncertainty. The assigned uncertainty is 4% for E miss T < 60 GeV, 15% for 60 < E miss T < 200 GeV, 34% for 200 < E miss T < 300 GeV, and 100% for E miss T > 300 GeV. The uncertainty in the last two E miss T bins is mostly due to the MC statistical uncertainty. Uncertainties are also assigned to account for the difference in the number of pileup interactions in the triggered DY + jets and \u03b3 + jets events (1-3%, increasing with E miss T ) and the purity of the photon selection (1-5%, increasing with E miss T ). With the E miss T -template method, the backgrounds from WZ, ZZ, and other rare SM processes are estimated using simulation. An uncertainty of 50% is assigned to the WZ and ZZ backgrounds based on comparisons with data in orthogonal control samples selected by requiring N jets \u2265 2 and either exactly three leptons (WZ control sample) or exactly four JHEP04 (2015)124leptons (ZZ control sample). For the other rare backgrounds, which include events with ttZ, ZZZ, ZZW, and ZWW production, an uncertainty of 50% is similarly assigned.",

The impact of the uncertainties on the considered signal models is shown in table 6. The uncertainty related to the measurement of the integrated luminosity is 2.6% [36]. The uncertainty related to the parton distribution functions (PDF) is evaluated using the PDF4LHC recommendations [37][38][39][40][41] and amounts to 0-6% in the signal acceptance. Uncertainties in the modeling of the reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies amount to 1% per lepton. The uncertainty of the corrections to account for lepton reconstruction differences between the fast and full simulations is 1% per lepton. The uncertainty in the trigger efficiencies is about 5%. Uncertainties in the muon momentum scale are negligible, whereas for electrons the uncertainty in the energy scale is 0.6% (1.5%) in the barrel (endcap) region, leading to a 0-5% uncertainty in the signal yield. The uncertainty JHEP04 2015 in the jet energy scale [42] varies between 0-8%. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale is propagated to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the E miss T distribution, which is found to be 0-8%. The uncertainty associated with the modeling of initial-state radiation (ISR) [43] is 0-14%. The uncertainty in the correction to account for pileup in the simulation is evaluated by shifting the inelastic cross section by \u00b15%. The impact on the signal yield is found to be about 1%.",

The resulting exclusion limits for these scenarios are shown in figure 8. The production of bottom squarks is considered, as the excess observed in data consists predominantly of events with at least one b jet. In the fixed-edge scenario, the mass difference between the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 neutralinos is fixed to 70 GeV, resulting in an edge in the m spectrum at this value. This choice for the edge position is motivated by the observed excess in the low-mass region of the counting experiment. Bottom-squark masses between 200 and 350 GeV are probed, depending on the value of the \u03c7 0 2 mass. In the slepton-edge scenario, the \u03c7 0 1 mass is set to 100 GeV, leaving the position of the edge as a free parameter that approximately corresponds to the mass difference between the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 0 1 . The branching fraction into dilepton final states is larger than in the fixed-edge scenario, and bottom-squark masses between 450 and 600 GeV are probed, again depending on the value of the \u03c7 0 2 mass. The loss of sensitivity seen in figure 8 (right) for \u03c7 0 2 masses around 250 GeV occurs because the peak of the triangular signal shape lies within, or close to, the gaps in acceptance between the low-mass and on-Z, or the on-Z and high-mass signal regions.",
