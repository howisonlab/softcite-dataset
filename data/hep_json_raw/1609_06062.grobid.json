For each hadron charge, the dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry on the hadron azimuthal angle \u03c6 is obtained by means of a fiveparameter fitting function that besides a \u03c6-independent term includes four modulations predicted by theory: sin \u03c6, sin 2\u03c6, sin 3\u03c6 and cos \u03c6. The amplitudes of the five terms have been extracted, first, for the hadrons in the whole available kinematic region. In further fits, performed for hadrons from a restricted kinematic region, the \u03c6-dependence is determined as a function of one of three variables (Bjorken-x, fractional energy of virtual photon taken by the outgoing hadron and hadron transverse momentum), while disregarding the others. Except the \u03c6-independent term, all the modulation amplitudes are very small, and no clear kinematic dependence could be observed within experimental uncertainties.",

            "text": "Momentum-Dependent (TMD) PDFs and parton-to-hadron Fragmentation Functions (FFs). These asymmetries can appear in SIDIS off unpolarised, longitudinally or transversely polarised nucleons. The TMD PDFs were studied in a number of experiments. The short overview of earlier results obtained by the HERMES, CLAS and COMPASS collaborations on azimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS production of charged hadrons was given in Ref. [6,7]. The COMPASS collaboration has published results on asymmetries off unpolarised 6 LiD (referred to as \"deuteron\") target [8], transversely polarised deuterons [9,10] and transversely polarised NH 3 (referred to as \"proton\") target [11][12][13][14][15][16]. The common analysis of transversely polarised deuteron and proton data is included in Ref. [11][12][13][14][15][16] also. The updated overview of the TMD PDFs including the COMPASS results can be found in Ref. [17]. The COMPASS results on azimuthal asymmetries off longitudinally polarised deuterons based on the data collected in 2002, 2003 and 2004 were published in Ref. [6] for so called \"integrated\" asymmetries and asymmetries as functions of kinematic variables extracted in the restricted kinematic region. Similar data have been collected in 2006 but not published yet. The results on the integrated asymmetries for 2006 and for the combined 2002-2006 data which are presented in this Paper are extracted using hadrons from the whole available kinematic region, at variance with Ref. [6], while asymmetries as functions of the kinematic variables are extracted using the hadrons from a restricted kinematic region, similar to Ref. [6].",

The symbol \u2190 denotes the incident muon spin orientation that, in the case of a positive charge of the incident muons, is mainly opposite to the beam direction. For the CERN muon beam, the average value of | P \u03bc | is equal to 0.8. The beam polarisation does not enter in the definition of measured asymmetries. The symbols \u21d2 and \u21d0 denote the target deuteron spin orientations (polarisations) the first of which is parallel, considered further as positive (+), and the second one is antiparallel (\u2212) to the beam direction (see Sect. 3.1). Substituting the general expression for d\u03c3 (Eq. 2) in the cross sections of the Eq. 3, one can obtain the expected contributions of the partial cross sections to the azimuthal asymmetries. As the result, when taking into account the signs of the target polarisations, one can see that only four partial cross sections contribute to the numerator of Eq. (3) and two to its denominator. In the numerator, we expect to have contributions from d\u03c3 0L , P \u03bc d\u03c3 L L and tan \u03b8 \u03b3 (d\u03c3 0T + P \u03bc d\u03c3 LT ), while in the denominator from d\u03c3 00 and P \u03bc d\u03c3 L0 .

These detectors provide data for reconstruction of corresponding tracks. The spectrometer was operated in the high energy (160 GeV) muon beam at CERN. Its initial configuration (see Ref. [23]) was used for data taking in 2002-2004. During the long accelerator shutdown in 2005, the set-up was modified (see Ref. [24]). The major modifications influencing the present analysis were as follows: (i) the replacement of the two 60 cm long target cells (denoted as U and D) by three cells U, M and D of lengths 30 cm, 60 cm and 30 cm, (ii) the replacement of the target solenoid magnet by the new one with a wider aperture and (iii) the installation of the electromagnetic calorimeter ECAL1 in front of the hadron calorimeter HCAL1. The ECAL1 is not used in the analysis because it was not fully operational yet in 2006 and partially acted as a hadron absorber. These modifications of the apparatus where aimed at further reduction of systematic uncertainties, enlargement of the spectrometer acceptance and improvement of e/\u03b3 PID capabilities.

Each group is characterised by its initial set of polarisations in the target cells which are obtained by using different frequencies of the microwave field to polarise the target material (deuterons) in different cells at the certain direction of the target magnet solenoid field. The solenoid fields holds the polarisation. The field direction is denoted as f = +, if it coincides with the beam direction, or f = \u2212, if opposite. The first group of the periods is denoted by G1 and other one by G2. Each period includes a certain number of intervals of continuous data taking (referred to as runs). The G1 data taking periods started with the initial setting of positive deuteron polarisation in target cells U and D and the negative one in cell M, both corresponding to f = +. After taking some number of runs, the field was reversed to f = \u2212 causing the reversal of the target cell polarisations, so that the data were taken with opposite deuteron polarisations in the cells. The periodic reversal of polarisations continued up to the end of G1 periods. Within the periods, the cell polarisations, needed for asymmetry calculations (see Sect. 3.5), were measured for each run in order to make sure that they are stable at the level of about 55%. If polarisations dropped below this limit, they were restored by the microwave field before the beginning of the next period. For G2 periods, the procedure was analogous but the initial setting of polarisation in the cells was opposite to the one in G1 at the same field f = +. The periodic reversal of the cell polarisations within each group of periods was used to estimate a possible timedependent systematics of the data. The change of the initial setting of the cell polarisations was used to estimate a possible systematic change of the spectrometer acceptance due to superposition of the solenoid field and the field of SM1. If there is no such systematic change, the acceptance in G1 and G2 periods must be the same for stable performance of the spectrometer.",

If the acceptances A i f of the cells are similar at the same f in the G1 and G2 groups of runs (it is subject for tests below), they are also folded equally in the corresponding number of events and \"cancel\" in the double ratios, i.e. it is not necessary to calculate them (see Sect. 5). In the numerator of each ratio, the number of events (hadrons) are taken from the runs with the positive target cell polarisation, while in the denominator they are taken from the runs with negative target polarisation.

They are given in Table 2. The combined 2002-2004 modulation amplitudes, calculated as for 2006, are also shown in Table 2 in order to allow comparison to those of Refs. [6,7], which were calculated in the restricted kinematic region. As expected for the iso-scalar deuteron target, consistent results are obtained for the \u03c6-independent terms a 0 h + and a 0 h \u2212 . All \u03c6modulation amplitudes are consistent with zero within uncertainties of fits. Comparing results for the 2002-2006 combined data presented in Table 2 to the results for 2002-2004 and to the results of Ref. [6], one can see that they are in agreement between themselves within the quoted uncertainties. This indicates that the integrated asymmetries with and without kinematic cuts of Table 1 are consistent, i.e. these cuts reduce statistics but do not change the values of the asymmetries within experimental uncertainties. Due to increased statistics of each year, the statistical uncertainties of the combined 2002-2006 amplitudes are reduced by a factor of about 1/1.6 compared to those of Ref. [6].",

The pull distribution had in total 750 entries compared to 540 for 2002-2004 years. The asymmetries reported in this Paper, in principle, could have the non-cancelled-acceptance or luminosity time-dependent effects folded in the event numbers of one of the Eqs. (5, 6)-ratio and, consequently, in one or several values of a i distorting the pull distribution. In the absence of such effects, as expected, the pull distribution follows the Gaussian distribution with the mean value consistent with zero (\u2212 0.038 \u00b1 0.033 in our case) and \u03c3 with unity (0.978 \u00b1 0.024). This indicates that no significant time-dependent systematic effects are present in the data on asymmetries, i.e. systematic uncertainties in values of a i are smaller than statistical ones. Quantitative measures of possible systematic effects have been obtained by estimating additive and multiplicative uncertainties. Main contributions to possible additive systematic uncertainties could come from the instabilities of the hadron yields. The \u03c6-stability of hadron yields in the 2006 data was checked following the procedure described in Refs. [6,7]. For this purpose, the double ratios of hadron numbers as a function of the azimuthal angle \u03c6 for different polarisation settings at the field f during the G1 and G2 runs were calculated as follows:",

(10) are modifications of ratios used in Refs. [6,7] for the case of two target cells. In the above double ratios, we expect the acceptance and luminosity cancellations and, as a result, the \u03c6-stability of the hadron yields. If unstable, they could indicate possible systematics in the acceptance as well. The fits by constants (see Fig. 8 ties of the order of 0.001. This means that no \u03c6-instabilities and acceptance-changing (not cancelled) effects have been observed, i.e. there are no large additive systematic uncertainties in the 2006 data. The value a h \u00b1 (\u03c6) = \u00b10.001 was chosen as a quantitative measure of possible additive systematic uncertainties in the 2006 asymmetry measurements. It is equal to \u00b1\u03c3 of the h + + h \u2212 data stability test for F(\u03c6). The same value was obtained for the 2002-2004 data [6,7] and hence adopted also for the combined 2002-2006 deuteron data. Possible sources of multiplicative systematic uncertainties of the asymmetry evaluation are uncertainties in the determination of the beam and target polarisations and estimations of the dilution factor. The multiplicative systematic uncertainties of the extracted asymmetries due to uncertainties in the determination of the beam and target polarisations were estimated to be less than 5% each and those due to uncertainties of the dilution factor to be less than about 2%. When combined in quadrature, overall possible multiplicative systematic uncertainty of less than 6% was obtained.",

Still, there are some hints (statistically not confirmed) for a possible x-dependence of the sin 2\u03c6, sin 3\u03c6 and cos \u03c6 modulation amplitudes. The sin 2\u03c6 amplitude for h \u2212 is mostly positive and rises with increasing x, while for h + it is mostly negative and decreases with x. This behaviour agrees with that discussed in Refs. [17,20,27], if one takes into account different definitions of asymmetries by the HERMES and COMPASS Collaborations. The increase with x of the modulus of the cos \u03c6 amplitudes, related to the Cahn-effect [28,29] and predicted in Ref. [30], was already  [6] and persists for the combined 2002-2006 data. Hints for a possible x-dependence of sin 3\u03c6 modulation amplitudes are discussed in Ref. [17]. Quantitative estimates of a possible contribution of the cos \u03c6 modulation to the deuteron asymmetries, related to TMD PDFs g \u22a5 L and e L , have been obtained in Ref. [31].
