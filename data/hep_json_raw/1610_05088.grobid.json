These interactions contribute directly to diboson and triboson production at colliders. Studies of triboson production can test these interactions and any possible observed deviation from the theoretical prediction would provide hints of new physics at a higher energy scale. Compared with TGCs, QGCs are usually harder to study due to the, in general, smaller production cross sections of the relevant processes.",

The ID consists of three subsystems: the pixel and silicon microstrip detectors that cover |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity, 1 and the outer transition radiation tracker that has an acceptance range of |\u03b7| < 2.0. The finely-segmented electromagnetic calorimeter is composed of lead absorbers with liquid argon (LAr) as the active material, spanning |\u03b7| < 3.2. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.8, a pre-sampler detector using a thin layer of LAr is used to correct for the energy loss by electrons and photons upstream of the calorimeter. The hadronic tile calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.7) consists of steel absorbers and scintillating tiles and is located directly outside the envelope of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. The endcap hadronic calorimeters use LAr as active material, with copper as absorber material, while the forward calorimeters use LAr as active material, with copper absorber for the first layer, dedicated to electromagnetic measurements, and tungsten for other layers, dedicated to hadronic measurements. The MS is composed of three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets, a system of three stations of tracking chambers in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, and a muon trigger system in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4. The precision muon momentum measurement is performed by monitored drift tubes everywhere except in the innermost layer for the range |\u03b7| > 2.0 where cathode strip chambers are used instead. The muon trigger system is composed of resistive plate chambers in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.05) and thin gap chambers in the endcap region (1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4).",

Three separate signal regions are defined based on the number of same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs in the event: 0 SFOS (e \u00b1 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 and \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 e \u2213 ), 1 SFOS (e \u00b1 e \u2213 \u03bc \u00b1 , e \u00b1 e \u2213 \u03bc \u2213 , \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 e \u00b1 , and \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 e \u2213 ), and 2 SFOS (e \u00b1 e \u00b1 e \u2213 and \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ). In the 0-SFOS case, the invariant mass of the same-flavour lepton pair, m , is required to be greater than 20 GeV. If there are at least two electrons in the event, the di-electron invariant mass, m ee , is required to have |m ee \u2212 m Z | > 15 GeV, where m Z is the pole mass of the Z boson [28]. No requirement is applied on the E miss T variable, as it was found to not discriminate between signal and backgrounds. In the 1-SFOS case, the SFOS dilepton invariant mass, m SFOS , is required to be outside of the region are mainly used to reduce the contributions from the Z +jets and W Z+jets processes.

            "text": "To select \u03bd \u03bd j j candidates, events are required to have exactly two leptons with the same electric charge, at least two jets, and no identified b-jets. Three different final states are considered based on the lepton flavour, namely e \u00b1 e \u00b1 , e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 , and \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 . The lepton p T (E miss T ) threshold is set to 30 (55) GeV to reduce the SM background contributions, though the E miss T criterion is not applied for the \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 final state due to the smaller Z +jets background expected in this channel. The leading (sub-leading) p T jet must have p T > 30 (20) GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The two jets are required to have 65 GeV < m j j < 105 GeV and | \u03b7 j j | < 1.5 in order to distinguish the signal from the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 backgrounds, where m j j is the dijet invariant mass and \u03b7 j j is the pseudorapidity separation between the two jets. The dilepton system is required to have m > 40 GeV and in the case of the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 final state, m ee must have m ee < 80 GeV or m ee > 100 GeV in order to suppress events with two opposite-sign prompt leptons where the charge of one of the electrons is misidentified. To reduce the contributions from W Z+jets and Z Z+jets production, events are removed if they contain additional leptons reconstructed with p T > 6 GeV passing looser identification quality requirements, with a medium identification requirement for electrons as defined in Ref. [21] and the minimum identification required for muon reconstruction. Table 2 shows the kinematic selection criteria used for the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel.  [29]. Electroweak NLO corrections have been calculated recently [30]. However, they are not considered in this analysis. In order to determine W \u00b1 W \u00b1 W \u2213 production cross sections, events are generated at NLO in QCD using Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO [31] including on-shell diagrams as well as Higgs associated diagrams. The CT10 NLO parton distribution function (PDF) [32] is used. Subsequent decays of unstable particles and parton showers are handled by pythia8 [33]. Fiducial cross sections are calculated using the generator-level lepton, jet, and E miss T definitions as described in Ref. [34]. Generator-level prompt leptons (those not originating from hadron and \u03c4 lepton decays) are dressed with prompt photons within a cone of size R = 0.1. Generatorlevel jets are reconstructed by applying the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 on all final-state particles after parton showering and hadronisation. The E miss T variable is calculated using all generator-level neutrinos. The same kinematic selection criteria as listed in Tables 1 and 2 are applied on these objects, with the exception of the b-jet veto requirements in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and the lepton quality requirements. To take into account the effect of the lepton isolation in the fiducial region, any lepton pairs must satisfy R( , ) > 0.1, and in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel any lepton-jet pairs must satisfy R( j, ) > 0.3. Electrons or muons from \u03c4 decays are not included.",

The parton shower and hadronisation are performed by pythia8. The fiducial cross sections are seen to be consistent between vbfnlo and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO when computed at the same order. The vbfnlo LO fiducial cross sections are normalized to the NLO fiducial cross section predicted by Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO for the signal yield calculations. These events are processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation [41] based on Geant 4 [42]. To simulate the effect of multiple pp interactions occurring during the same or a neighbouring bunch crossing, minimum-bias interactions are generated and overlaid on the hard-scattering process. These events are then processed through the same object reconstruction and identification algorithms as used on data. MC events are reweighted so that the pile-up conditions in the simulation match the data. Additional corrections are made to the simulated samples to account for small differences between the simulation and the data for the object identification and reconstruction efficiencies, the trigger efficiencies, and the energy and momentum scales and resolutions. While excluded in the fiducial cross-section definition, the contribution from events with W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd decays are counted as signal in the vbfnlo signal sample used in the final event selection.

A tag lepton must satisfy the signal lepton requirements while a looser lepton selection criterion is defined for probe leptons with the lepton isolation requirements removed and the electron quality requirement loosened to medium as defined in Ref.

For prompt leptons this uncertainty is \u00b1(5 to 10)% while for fake leptons and misidentified/non-prompt leptons this uncertainty is \u00b1(80 to 90)%. The latter uncertainty is a conservative estimate which accounts for differences in the heavy-flavour and lightflavour composition between the signal region and the control region where the fake-lepton efficiency is determined for these leptons. In the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel, the systematic uncertainty results from the uncertainties in the measurement of the fake factors, which is estimated to be \u00b1(20 to 30)%. Statistical uncertainties in the samples used for the matrix method and the fake-factor method also contribute to the overall uncertainty of the estimation of the fake-lepton background. The total uncertainty in the overall fake-lepton background yield is \u00b113% in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and \u00b18% in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel.",

Its uncertainty is dominated by the statistical precision with which the electron charge misidentification rate is determined from the available data. Since the charge-flip background estimation uses the number of Z (\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) + 2 jets events, the number of events in the data also contributes to the overall systematic uncertainty. In the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel, the uncertainty on the charge-flip background estimate is \u00b10.5% in the 0-SFOS region but is \u00b10.04% for the total background estimate in all three signal regions. In the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel, the total system- atic uncertainty in the overall background yield due to the uncertainty in the charge-flip background estimate is found to be \u00b12.2%. There are also uncertainties in the overall normalization of the signal and MC background cross sections. Uncertainties in the signal cross section are those described in Sect. 4. These are not, however, included as uncertainties in the model and merely serve as a comparison for the final measurement in Sect. 7. The normalizations of the SM background cross sections described in Sect. 5.1 have their own associated uncertainties. The uncertainty in the predicted W Z+jets background cross section is the most important one since it is the largest irreducible background. The size of the uncertainty relative to the predicted W Z+jets background is \u00b110% in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and \u00b1(16 to 23)% in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel depending on the production mechanism. This uncertainty is based on the measurement performed in the control region, for the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel as described in Sect. 5, while it is a combination of the scale, PDF and parton shower uncertainties estimated as in Ref. [12], for the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel. The remaining uncertainties are mostly negligible in the overall background prediction. The normalization uncertainty in the total background prediction is around \u00b18% in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and \u00b113% in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel.",

The significance of \u03bc is obtained with the above test statistic, and is estimated using 100,000 MC pseudo-experiments to determine how well the fit result agrees with the background-only hypothesis. The observed (expected) significance of a positive signal cross section is 0.96 \u03c3 (1.05 \u03c3 ) for the combination of the two channels. Most of the sensitivity comes from the 0-SFOS category in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and the \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 category in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel. The most significant deviation from the signal-plus-background hypothesis occurs in the e \u00b1 e \u00b1 region, where zero events are observed and 4.0 background and 0.46 signal events are expected. The probability that the background fluctuates down to zero events is 2.3%. The central value of \u03bc corresponds to the minimum of the negative log-likelihood distribution. The measured fiducial cross section in each channel is obtained by multiplying \u03bc by the expected value of the fiducial cross section in that channel. The measured total cross section is obtained by combining the results for the two channels and then extrapolating to the total phase space using the signal acceptance. The log-likelihood scans for the total crosssection measurement are evaluated with and without systematic uncertainties and are shown in Fig. 4. The expected and observed fiducial and total cross sections are summarized in Table 6. The presence of the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 W \u2213 signal is also assessed using a one-sided 95% CL upper limit on the production cross section using the CL s method of Ref. [59]. The limits are evaluated using 2000 MC pseudo-experiments. The observed (expected) upper limit on the fiducial cross section in the absence of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 W \u2213 production is found to be 1.3 fb (1.1 fb) in the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd channel and 1.1 fb (0.9 fb) in the \u03bd \u03bd j j channel.

However, there is no theoretical algorithm to predict for which form-factor cutoff scale the cross section would violate unitarity. Therefore different values of FF are considered with FF = 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 TeV as well as FF = \u221e, which corresponds to the non-unitarized case. Events with aQGCs are generated with vbfnlo at LO and passed through the ATLAS detector simulation. A grid of samples is obtained using different parameters of f S,0 / 4 and f S,1 / 4 values. The interpolation between these points is performed with a 2-dimensional quadratic function in the ( f S,0 / 4 , f S,1 / 4 ) space. The LO samples are scaled using Table 6 The predicted and observed fiducial cross sections for the \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd and \u03bd \u03bd j j channels and the predicted and observed total cross section for the combination of the two channels  a factor derived from the ratio of the SM LO to NLO predictions.

Even though aQGC events tend to have leptons or jets with larger momenta, the detection efficiency for events in the fiducial region is found to be consistent with the one obtained for the SM sample within 20%. The efficiencies of the aQGC samples are used with their statistical and systematic uncertainties to derive the 95% confidence intervals (CI) on aQGC, while the largest observed deviation of the aQGC efficiencies from the SM one is used as an extra systematic uncertainty. Frequentist CI on the anomalous coupling are computed by forming a profile-likelihoodratio test that incorporates the observed and expected numbers of signal events for different values of the anomalous couplings. Table 7 shows the expected and observed 95% CI on f S,0 / 4 ( f S,1 / 4 ) with different FF values, assuming f S,1 / 4 ( f S,0 / 4 ) to be zero. Figure 5 shows the twodimensional 95% CL contour limits of f S,0 / 4 vs f S,1 / 4 in the cases where FF = 1 TeV and FF = \u221e. For FF = \u221e, the limits can be compared to the stronger limits obtained by the CMS Collaboration in Ref.",
