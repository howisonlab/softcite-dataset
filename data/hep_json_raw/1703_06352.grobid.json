The search is based on a 2.6 fb \u22121 sample of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis is optimized for final states in which the T quark decays to a W boson and a bottom quark. The focus is on all-jet final states in which both the W boson and the top quark decay into quarks that evolve into jets. The decay products of the top quark and of the W boson are assumed to be highly Lorentz-boosted and cannot be reconstructed as separate jets, but are instead reconstructed as merged, wide jets. Techniques for the identification of jet substructure and jet flavour are used to distinguish signal from background events. Several models for Z bosons decaying to T quarks are excluded at 95% confidence level, with upper limits on the cross section ranging from 0.13 to 10 pb, depending on the chosen hypotheses. This is the first search for a neutral spin-1 heavy resonance decaying to a top quark and a vector-like T quark in the all-hadronic final state.",

However, in models with a heavy gluon [22,23], a composite Higgs boson [24], or extra spatial dimensions [22,25], an additional fermionic sector may be present in the form of a nonchiral (or vector-like) fourth generation of quarks. Topologies in which the Z boson decays into vector-like quarks have not yet been investigated experimentally.

The first model [22] is an effective theory with one warped extra dimension that considers only the lowest-energy spin-1 and spin-1/2 resonances to describe the decays of the lightest Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon, G * , to one SM particle and one heavy fermion. We consider the specific case where the G * resonance decays to a top quark and a heavy top quark partner T. The model assumes branching fractions (B) to be 50/25/25% for T quark decay to the bW/tH/tZ channels. Benchmark values of tan \u03b8 3 = 0.44, sin \u03c6 tR = 0.6, and Y * = 3 are used for the model parameters. These benchmark values enhance the decays of the heavy resonance to a SM quark and a vector-like quark. The definitions of the parameters, the choice of their values, and their impact on the cross section are explained in ref. [22], and the significant discovery potential of the LHC already with comparatively small luminosity is discussed. This model predicts the existence of other vector-like quarks such as the T 5/3 quark, with a charge of five-thirds and a mass lower than the mass of the T quark. These other heavy quarks can have a moderate impact on the branching fraction of the G * resonance to Tt, and their contribution is properly taken into account when comparing the model with the results of the analysis. In particular, the T 5/3 quark becomes relevant when the mass of the G * resonance is twice its mass.",

The kinematic distributions of the decay modes considered are comparable between the two models. Hypothetical top quark flavour-changing neutral currents generated in the interaction between the top quark, Z boson, and T quark are estimated to be below the reach of current measurements [27] because of the large suppression generated by off-shell effects of the Z boson and the T quark. The leading order Feynman diagram for the production of the Z boson and the decay chain under consideration is depicted in figure 1.",

The two types of jets are reconstructed independently. Charged hadrons not associated with the primary vertex of the interaction are not considered when clustering. Corrections based on the jet area [52] are applied to remove the energy contribution of neutral hadrons arising from pileup collisions. Further corrections are used to account for the nonlinear calorimeter response as a function of \u03b7 and p T [53], derived from simulation and from data-to-simulation correction factors. Spurious jets due to detector noise effects are removed by requiring that neutral particles contribute less than 99% of the electromagnetic and hadronic energy in a jet. Only jets with |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered; no requirements on lepton or imbalance in transverse momentum are applied.",

One of the jets corresponds to the boosted top quark from the decay of the Z boson, the second originates from the W boson of the T quark decay, and the third is from the b quark emitted in the T quark decay. These selection criteria are optimized for the decay of the T quark to bW, but the analysis is sensitive to the other decay modes of the T quark as well. To identify t jets, the jets associated with top quarks, the \"CMS top tagger v2\" [54] algorithm is used. In this algorithm, the constituents of the AK8 jets are reclustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [55,56]. The modified mass-drop tagger algorithm [57], also known as the \"soft drop\" algorithm with angular exponent \u03b2 = 0, soft threshold z cut < 0.1, and characteristic radius R 0 = 0.8 [58], is used to remove soft, wide-angle radiation from the jet. This algorithm identifies two subjets within the AK8 jet corresponding to the b JHEP09 (2017)053jet and the decay of the W boson. Additionally, the \"N-subjettiness\" variables \u03c4 N [59,60] are used. These variables, calculated using all the particle-flow constituents of the AK8 jet, quantify the degree to which a jet can be regarded as composed of N subjets.",

No selection criteria are applied to specifically target the tH and tZ final states of the T quark. Table 1 shows the selection efficiency for the signal in the different event categories. The samples with the smallest difference in mass between the Z boson and T quark have a degraded reconstruction efficiency because of the low p T of the top quark originating from -6 -JHEP09(2017)053 the decay of the Z boson. For several mass points the reconstruction efficiency is higher for the T \u2192 tH or T \u2192 tZ decay channel than for T \u2192 bW, for which the analysis is optimized. This is because if the T quark decays to a t quark instead of a b quark, there are two t quarks in the final state, hence it is more likely that at least one of the two t quarks will be tagged.

One-dimensional cross section limits at 95% CL as a function of the heavy vector resonance mass for m T = 1.2 TeV, assuming branching fractions of the T quark decay to the tH/tZ channels of 50/50% (left) or to the bW/tH/tZ channels of 50/25/25% (right). The solid line is the observed limit, the dotted line is the expected limit, shown with 68% (inner) and 95% (outer) uncertainty bands. In the left plot, the green thick line is the product of the cross section and branching fraction for a heavy spin-1 resonance \u03c1 0 L \u2192 Tt in a composite Higgs boson model [24]. In the right plot, the blue thick line is the product of the cross section and branching fraction for a heavy gluon G * \u2192 Tt in a warped extra-dimension model [22]. The theoretical predictions are shown as dashed lines where the width of the resonance is larger than 10% of its mass.",
