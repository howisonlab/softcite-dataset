Using 217 days of data, 296,721 and 41,589 inverse beta decay (IBD) candidates were detected in the near and far halls, respectively. The measured IBD yield is (1.55 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 2 /GW/day or (5.92 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission. This flux measurement is consistent with previous short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments and is 0.946 \u00b1 0.022 (0.991 \u00b1 0.023) relative to the flux predicted with the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. The measured IBD positron energy spectrum deviates from both spectral predictions by more than 2\u03c3 over the full energy range with a local significance of up to \u223c4\u03c3 between 4-6 MeV. A reactor antineutrino spectrum of IBD reactions is extracted from the measured positron energy spectrum for model-independent predictions.",

            "text": "Reactor antineutrino experiments have played a key role in developing the picture of neutrinos in the Standard Model of particle physics. They provided the first experimental observation of (anti)neutrinos [1], confirmed neutrino oscillation as the solution to the solar neutrino problem [2], provided the first detection of geo-neutrinos [3], and discovered the nonzero neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 [4,5]. Forthcoming reactor antineutrino experiments are aiming to further explore the nature of neutrinos by determining the neutrino mass hierarchy, precisely measuring neutrino mixing parameters, and searching for short-baseline neutrino oscillation [6]. Over the last five decades, reactor antineutrino experiments have measured the flux and spectrum of antineutrinos at various distances from nuclear reactors ranging from \u223c10 m to several hundred kilometers. These measurements were found to be in good agreement [7] with predictions derived from the measurements of the beta spectra at ILL [8][9][10] and Vogel's theoretical calculation [11] when considering the effect of three-neutrino oscillation. In 2011, re-evaluations of the reactor antineutrino flux and spectrum with improved theoretical treatments were carried out [12,13], and determined the flux to be higher than the experimental data. This discrepancy is commonly referred to as the \"Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly\" [14] and may be a sign of new physics or insufficient fissile antineutrino modeling. Precision measurements by modern reactor antineutrino experiments can shed light on this issue and probe the physics underlying current reactor antineutrino predictions. An accurate determination of the reactor antineutrino spectrum can also provide valuable input to next-generation single-detector reactor antineutrino experiments [15].",

The power and fission fractions contributed 0.5% and 0.6% uncertainties to the predicted antineutrino rate, respectively. Simulation of reactor cores based on DRAGON [24] was constructed to study the correlations among the fission fractions of the four isotopes [25]. The energies released per fission (0.2-0.5% uncertainty) were from Ref. [26]. Non-equilibrium (30% uncertainty) and SNF (100% uncertainty) corrections were applied following Refs.

The 0.9% total uncertainty in antineutrino flux due to reactor power, fission fractions, and non-equilibrium and SNF corrections was treated to be uncorrelated among reactors in the corresponding oscillation analysis [17].

[29] utilizing an updated Daya Bay IBD MC. The IBD neutron-Gd capture fraction is dependent on the target's Gd concentration and on the escape, or 'spill-out', of IBD neutrons from the target. The former has been measured using neutron calibration sources deployed at the detector center, while the latter was estimated with MC-data comparisons of source deployments throughout the GdLS volume with a manual calibration system [34]. The efficiency for detecting Gd-capture IBD neutrons, also called the delayed energy cut efficiency, is dependent on the amount of Gd-capture \u03b3 energy deposited outside the scintillator, and was determined using MC benchmarked to the IBD Gd-capture spectrum from data. Finally, in order to account for contributions from IBD interactions outside the GdLS target, we have applied a spill-in correction determined using MC-data comparisons of IBD coincidence time and reconstructed position distributions. The updated detector efficiency \u03b5 was estimated to be 80.6% with an AD-correlated fractional uncertainty \u03b4 \u03b5 /\u03b5 of 2.1%. Application of additional AD-dependent muon veto and multiplicity cut efficiencies, described in detail in Refs. [17,29], produced total detection efficiencies \u03b5 IBD ranging from 64.6% to 77.2% among ADs. The total correlated uncertainty was dominated by the spill-in correction, whose uncertainty enveloped the individual uncertainties provided by three independent methods and was limited by small biases in position reconstruction. A cross-check of the spill-in effect provided by data-MC comparisons of neutron sources deployed outside the target volume showed agreement well within this uncertainty.",

The antineutrino spectrum at each detector was predicted by the procedure described above, taking into account neutrino oscillation with sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.090 and \u2206m 2 ee = 2.59 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 based on the oscillation analysis of the same data [17]. The detector response was determined in two ways. The first method sequentially applied a simulation of energy loss in the inactive acrylic vessels, and analytical models of energy scale and energy resolution. The energy scale model was based on empirical characterization of the spatial non-uniformity and the energy non-linearity with improved calibration of the scintillator light yield and the electronics response [39]. The uncertainty of the energy scale was about 1% in the energy range of reactor antineutrinos [39]. The second method used full-detector simulation in which the detector response was tuned with the calibration data. Both methods produced consistent predictions for prompt energies above 1.25 MeV. Around 1 MeV, there was a slight discrepancy due to different treatments of IBD positrons that interact with the inner acrylic vessels. Additional uncertainty below 1.25 MeV was included to cover this discrepancy. Figure 2 shows the observed prompt-energy spectrum and its comparison with the predictions. The predicted spectra were normalized to the measurement in order to test the agreement between spectral shapes. The spectral uncertainty of the measurement is composed of the statistical, detector response and background uncertainties. Between 1.5 and 7 MeV, it ranges from 1.0% at 3.5 MeV to 6.7% at 7 MeV, and above 7",

In the second approach, the significance of deviations are conveyed with p-values calculated within local energy windows. A free-floating nuisance parameter for the normalization of each bin within a chosen energy window was introduced to the fitter that was used in the neutrino oscillation analysis [17]. The overall normalization was unconstrained in the fit. The difference in the minimum \u03c7 2 before and after introducing these nuisance parameters was used to evaluate the p-value of the deviation from the theoretical prediction within each window. The p-values within 1-MeV energy windows are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. The p-value for a 2-MeV window between 4 and 6 MeV reached a similar minimum of 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which corresponds to a 4.0\u03c3 deviation. The ILL+Vogel model showed a similar level of discrepancy between 4 and 6 MeV. The number of events in excess of the predictions in the 4-6 MeV region was estimated to comprise approximately 1-2% of all events in both the near and far detectors. This excess is approximately 10% of events within the 4-6 MeV region. This discrepancy was found to be time-independent and correlated with reactor power, therefore disfavoring hypotheses involving unknown backgrounds. The hypothesis that the excess was due to detector response was disfavored given that no discrepancy was observed in the 12 B spectrum [17]. A similar excess was observed in other reactor antineutrino experiments [40,41]. A recent ab-initio calculation of the antineutrino spectrum showed a similar deviation from previous predictions in the 4-6 MeV region, and identified prominent fission daughter isotopes as a potential explanation [42]. A number of tentative explanations based on the nuclear physics of beta decays and fission yields have been put forward and are under active investigation; for examples, see Refs. [42][43][44][45][46]. These studies suggest an increased uncertainty in both the yields and spectra of the fissile antineutrino models, which may also account for the discrepancy.",

The bias outside this region was about 4% and increased with energy due to the decrease of events. The bias values were assigned as additional uncertainties to the unfolded spectrum.

The measured IBD yield is (1.55 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 \u221218 cm 2 /GW/day or (5.92 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 /fission. This flux measurement is consistent with the global average of previous short baseline experiments and is 0.946 \u00b1 0.022 (0.991 \u00b1 0.023) times the prediction using the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. In addition, the measured and predicted spectra are discrepant with a significance of \u223c4\u03c3 in the 4-6 (5-7) MeV region of the IBD prompt (antineutrino) energy spectrum. Investigation of the discrepancy strongly disfavors explanations involving detector response or an unknown background. A reactor antineutrino spectrum was extracted from the measurement at Daya Bay, enabling model-independent predictions of reactor antineutrino spectra.",

The rate predicted with the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) model and its uncertainty are shown in blue (orange). Bottom: The measured reactor\u03bde rate as a function of the distance from the reactor, normalized to the theoretical prediction with the Huber+Mueller model. The rate is corrected for 3-flavor neutrino oscillations at each baseline. The blue shaded region represents the global average and its 1\u03c3 uncertainty. The 2.7% model uncertainty is shown as a band around unity. Measurements at the same baseline are combined for clarity. The Daya Bay measurement is shown at the flux-weighted baseline (573 m) of the two near halls.",
