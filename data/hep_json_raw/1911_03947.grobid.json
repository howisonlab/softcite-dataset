            "text": "New particles that decay to pairs of jets and appear as dijet resonances arise in a variety of models. String resonances [1,2] originate from the Regge excitations of quarks and gluons. Scalar diquarks [3] are predicted by a grand unified theory based on the E 6 gauge symmetry group. Mass-degenerate excited quarks (q * ) [4,5] appear in quark compositeness models. Axigluons and colorons, axial-vector and vector particles, are expected in the chiral color [6,7] and the flavor-universal coloron [7,8] models, respectively. Color-octet scalars [9] appear in dynamical electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking models, such as technicolor. New gauge bosons (W and Z ) can exist with standard model (SM) like or leptophobic couplings [10]. Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravitons are predicted in the RS model of extra dimensions [11]. Dark matter (DM) mediators arise from an interaction between quarks and DM [12][13][14][15]. The natural width, \u0393, of a new particle increases with its coupling strength to other states, and may vary from narrow to broad, as defined in comparison to the experimental resolution.",

            "text": "This paper describes a model-independent search for a narrow or broad s-channel dijet resonance with a mass above 1.8 TeV, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. This search uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 collected in 2016-2018 with the CMS detector at the LHC. Similar searches have been published previously by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at \u221a s [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25],  using strategies reviewed in ref. [33]. Results of the search are interpreted using as JHEP05(2020)033 benchmarks the models described above. As no excess above the SM was observed, we set limits on the production cross sections of new particles decaying to the parton pairs qq (or qq), qg, and gg. We then use these limits to constrain the benchmark models, with the same choices of parameters as those that were used in the most recent CMS search [17], which used data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb \u22121 . In the color-octet scalar model, the squared anomalous coupling k 2 s = 1/2 [34] is used. For the RS graviton model, the value of the dimensionless coupling k/M Pl is chosen to be 0.1, where k is the curvature scale in the 5-dimensional anti de Sitter space and M Pl is the reduced Planck scale defined as M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0. For the DM mediator, we follow the recommendations of ref.",

This new \"ratio method\" yields smaller systematic uncertainties when performed in the same dijet mass range as the \"fit method\", and the sensitivity for broad resonance searches is improved by up to a factor of two depending on the resonance width and mass. In addition, the total integrated luminosity for this search is roughly a factor of four larger than that used by the previous CMS search [17], so the sensitivity of both narrow and broad resonance searches has also increased by up to an additional factor of two.",

At least one reconstructed vertex is required. Charged PF candidates not originating from the primary vertex are removed prior to the jet finding. The candidate vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T , where p T is the transverse momentum, is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm mentioned above, with the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. For jets, an event-by-event correction based on jet area [40,41] is applied to the jet energy to remove the estimated contribution from additional collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup).",

For this selection the combined L1 trigger and HLT was found to be fully efficient, as measured using a sample acquired with an independent trigger requiring at least one muon with p T > 50 GeV at the HLT. The |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.1 requirement makes the trigger efficiency increase sharply and plateau at a value of 100% for relatively low values of dijet mass. This is because the jet p T threshold of the trigger at a fixed dijet mass is more easily satisfied at low |\u2206\u03b7|, as seen by the approximate relation m jj \u2248 2p T cosh(|\u2206\u03b7|/2).

By contrast, most s-channel signals from dijet resonances decrease with increasing |\u2206\u03b7|, as the signal shown does. Figure 1 shows the division of the |\u2206\u03b7| distribution into the signal and control regions. Figure 2 shows, for both data and the QCD background, the dijet mass spectra in the signal and control regions, which fall steeply and smoothly as a function of dijet mass.

This correction is required because, as seen in the upper right panel of figure 4, differences are present between data and the simulation using pythia. These are due to both theoretical and experimental effects. The theoretical effects arise because the pythia simulation uses a QCD calculation at LO, and higher order QCD corrections have some effect, and so do missing EW corrections. Figure 4 shows, with a smaller sample of events, that a better agreement is obtained when these corrections are included, by generating events at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD with powheg JHEP05 (2020)033v2.0 [51][52][53] and incorporating an estimate of EW effects [54]. Experimental effects include differences between data and simulation at higher jet pseudorapidities outside the barrel calorimeter region (|\u03b7| >1.3). The higher-order QCD and EW effects, and the differences between data and simulation at higher jet pseudorapidity values, produce a similar effect on the shape of the transfer factor, affecting mainly the high dijet mass region. We correct the simulated transfer factor to include these effects in a data-driven way, using the second control region, CR middle , which is a |\u2206\u03b7| sideband to the SR. This second control region contains dijet events with values of jet pseudorapidity very similar to those in the SR, and has a very small signal contamination. As such, the dijet mass distribution of this control region is very similar to that of the SR, and the differences between data and simulation in this control region are caused by similar theoretical and experimental effects as observed in the SR. Hence, this second CR allows the definition of an auxiliary transfer factor, R aux , shown in eq. (52).",

Specifically, the values of the parameters and their statistical uncertainties from the background-only fits of the data to simulation ratios of R aux are p 0 = 0.977 \u00b1 0.004 and p 1 = 2.07 \u00b1 0.33, and of R are p 0 = 0.972 \u00b1 0.004 and p 1 = 2.52 \u00b1 0.28, and are entirely compatible. This agreement is expected given that the events in CR middle and SR have, by construction, very similar jet \u03b7 and m jj distributions. Parameters p 0 and p 1 are treated as free nuisance parameters in the final signal plus background simultaneous fit of the SR, CR middle and CR high , taking the signal contamination in the control regions into account as described in the next paragraph. The simultaneous background-only fit yields p 0 = 0.973 \u00b1 0.003 and p 1 = 2.38 \u00b1 0.23, consistent with the separate backgroundonly fits shown in figure 4 (lower panels), and with smaller uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty in the background, for both methods, is automatically evaluated via profiling. This effectively refits for the optimal values of the background parameters, allowing them to float freely, for each value of the resonance cross section.",

These distributions are created for several resonance masses and widths, spanning the entire range for which results are reported. Then, the same fitting procedure followed in the analysis of the actual data is repeated for each pseudo-data distribution, and the fitted signal cross section, along with its 68% CL standard deviation, is obtained. We examine the distribution of the bias in units of standard deviations, namely the difference between the injected signal cross section and the fitted signal cross section, divided by the standard deviation of the fit. For all resonance masses, widths, and signal strengths considered, the mean bias is less than one half a standard deviation, and in the vast majority of the cases it is well below this criterion. In addition, pseudo-data distributions are generated using different empirical functional forms than the ones used in the actual data fits, and the entire procedure is repeated, again yielding negligible biases.",

The ratio method provides a background estimate that is derived primarily from control regions, while the fit method uses only the signal region. The ratio method also provides a background estimate that is more accurate than the fit method. This is because the ratio method fits the data with only two parameters, while the fit method requires four, and because the estimate from the ratio method is additionally constrained by the control region CR middle . The advantages of this method, as opposed to the fit method, are the following: i) it provides a background estimate independent of the signal region, which results in an independent and less biased value of the observed signal significance, ii) as the resonance width increases the ratio method has smaller background uncertainty compared to the fit method, and hence higher sensitivity. Therefore, we estimate the background using the ratio method instead of the fit method for m jj > 2.4 TeV. Figure 5 shows the dijet mass spectrum, defined as the observed number of events in each bin divided by the integrated luminosity and the bin width. The bin widths depend on the dijet mass and are chosen to correspond to dijet mass resolution. The bin edges were chosen to be the same as those used by previous dijet resonances searches performed by the CMS Collaboration, as introduced in ref. [31]. Figure 5 also shows the background prediction from the fit method, compared to all data, and the background prediction from the ratio method, compared to data with m jj > 2.4 TeV. The \u03c7 2 /NDF of the backgroundonly fit, masking the signal region, with the ratio method is 42.04/32 as shown in figure 5.

The modified frequentist criterion [58,59] is used to set upper limits on signal cross sections, following the prescription described in refs. [60,61] using the asymptotic approximation of the test statistic. We use a multi-bin counting experiment likelihood, which is a product of Poisson distributions corresponding to different bins. We evaluate the likelihood independently at each value of resonance pole mass from 1.8 to 8.7 TeV in 100-GeV steps. The fit method is used to estimate the background for resonance masses from 1.8 to 2.9 TeV, and the ratio method is used for resonance masses from 3.0 to 8.7 TeV. The minimum values of resonance mass for the two methods, 1.8 and 3.0 TeV, are chosen to maintain reasonable acceptances for the minimum m jj requirements, 1.5 and 2.4 TeV, respectively. The sources of systematic uncertainty are implemented as nuisance parameters in the likelihood model, with Gaussian constraints for the jet energy scale and resolution, and log-normal constraints for the integrated luminosity. The background systematic uncertainty, as we described previously, is automatically evaluated via profiling and decreases as the resonance mass increases. Figures 6 and 7 show the model-independent observed upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section (\u03c3), the branching fraction (B), and the acceptance (A) for narrow resonances, with the kinematic requirements |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.1 for the dijet system and |\u03b7| < 2.5 for each jet. The narrow resonance shapes are the ones presented and discussed in detail in a previous publication [17]. The acceptance of the minimum dijet mass requirement in each search, which fully accounts for the overall experimental acceptance, has been evaluated separately for qq, qg, and gg resonances. We include these acceptances in the determination of the limits. Figure 6 also shows the expected limits on \u03c3BA and their bands of uncertainty. Figure 7 shows the different limits for qq, qg, and gg resonances, which originate from differences in their line shapes. For the RS graviton, which decays to both qq and gg, we obtain cross section upper limits from the average, weighted by branching fraction, of the limits on quark-quark and gluon-gluon resonances.",

Local significance for a qq resonance with the ratio method (blue line) and the fit method (red dashed line). coloron models a correction factor is applied which varies between K = 1.1 at a resonance mass of 0.6 TeV and K = 1.3 at 8.1 TeV [7]. The branching fraction includes the direct decays of the resonance into the five light quarks and gluons only, excluding top quarks from the decay, although top quarks are included in the calculation of the resonance width. The acceptance is evaluated at the parton level for the resonance decay to two partons. In the case of isotropic decays, the acceptance is A \u2248 0.5 and is independent of the resonance mass. For a given model, new particles are excluded at 95% CL in mass regions where the theoretical prediction lies at or above the observed upper limit for the appropriate final state of figure 6. Table 1 shows the mass limits on all benchmark models which are extended by 200 to 800 GeV relative to those reported in previous CMS dijet resonance searches [17].",

We use spin-1 resonances decaying to quark-quark pairs with a width up to 55% of the resonance mass, M , as well as spin-2 resonances that decay to quark or gluon pairs with a width up to 30% of the resonance mass. This allows us to be sensitive to more models and larger couplings. The spin-1 resonance results are also used to produce limits on the universal quark coupling of a leptophobic vector mediator of interactions between quarks and DM particles, and limits for a leptophobic Z that couples to quarks but does not couple to DM particles [12][13][14][15]. In order to be sensitive to the largest possible coupling values for these particles, the maximum value of examined widths for spin-1 resonances is increased to 55% of the resonance mass. The additional wider signals are produced in the same way as the narrower ones, using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo v. 2.3.2 [64] generator at LO, and the pythia 8.205 [44] program, followed by a Geant4-based [48] simulation of the CMS detector. For resonance widths up to 30% of their mass, the dijet mass distributions are the ones presented and discussed in detail in ref. [17]. The dijet mass distributions of both wide and narrow spin-1 resonances are shown in figure 9, and exhibit the same behavior as the ones discussed in [17].",

We do not present limits for the case of spin-1 resonances in the quark-quark channel with masses larger than 6 TeV and \u0393/M > 0.1. These resonances are not part of the search because they have an exceedingly broad and high tail at low dijet mass, as described in ref. [17], which dominates the limit and produces unstable search results. The spin-1 cross -17 -JHEP05(2020)033 section limits in figure 10 have been used to derive constraints on the coupling to quarks of mediators of new interactions. We consider two models of a leptophobic mediator which couples to all generations of quarks with the same universal strength. The quark coupling is denoted g q in the first model, in which the mediator does not couple to DM particles, and denoted g q in the second model, in which the mediator couples to DM particles. For each mediator mass value, the predictions for the cross section of mediator production as a function of the quark coupling are converted to predictions as a function of width. They are then compared to the spin-1 cross section limits from figure 10 to find the excluded values of quark coupling, as a function of mass for a spin-1 resonance. Figure 11 (right) shows upper limits on the coupling g q as a function of mass for our first model, also known as a leptophobic Z resonance [65] that couples only to quarks. In this model the resonance has a width 1) where M Med is the resonance mass and g q is the universal quark coupling, related to the coupling, g B , of ref. [65] by g q = g B /6. Figure 11 (left) shows upper limits on the coupling g q as a function of mass for our second model, also known as a DM Mediator model, which has a leptophobic spin-1 mediator that couples both to quarks and DM particles [15], and for Dirac DM with a mass m DM = 1 GeV and a coupling g DM = 1.0. The cross section of mediator production for m DM = 1 GeV and g DM = 1 is calculated with Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo [64] for mediator masses within the range 1.6 < M Med < 5.1 TeV in 0.1 TeV steps and for quark couplings within the range 0.1 < g q < 1.0 in 0.1 steps.

Generic upper limits are presented on the product of the cross section, the branching fraction, and the acceptance for narrow and broad quark-quark, quark-gluon, and gluon-gluon resonances. The limits are applied to various models of new resonances and yield the following 95% confidence level lower limits on the resonance masses: 7.9 TeV for string resonances, 7.5 TeV for scalar diquarks, 6.6 TeV for axigluons and colorons, 6.3 TeV for excited quarks, 3.7 TeV for color-octet scalars, 3.6 TeV for W bosons with SM-like couplings, 2.9 TeV and between 3.1 and 3.3 TeV for Z bosons with SM-like couplings, 2.6 TeV for Randall-Sundrum gravitons, and 2.8 TeV for dark matter (DM) mediators. With this search, limits on narrow resonances are improved by 200 to 800 GeV relative to those reported in previous CMS dijet resonance searches. Limits are also presented for spin-2 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass, and spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 55% of the resonance mass. These limits are used to improve and extend the exclusions of a DM mediator to larger values of the resonance mass and coupling to quarks. In the search for broad resonances, the ratio method provides significantly enhanced sensitivity compared to the fit method, resulting in the exclusion at 95% confidence level of a DM mediator with mass less than 4.8 TeV for a width equal to 45% of the mass, which corresponds to a coupling to quarks g q = 0.9.",

The lower panel shows the difference between the data and the fitted parametrization (red, solid), and the data and the prediction obtained from the control region (green, hatched), divided by the statistical uncertainty in the data, which for the ratio method includes the statistical uncertainty in the data in the control region. Examples of predicted signals from narrow gluon-gluon, quarkgluon, and quark-quark resonances are shown (dashed coloured lines) with cross sections equal to the observed upper limits at 95% CL.",
