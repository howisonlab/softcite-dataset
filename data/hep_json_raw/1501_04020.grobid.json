This search is sensitive to long-lived particles that decay to Standard Model particles producing jets at the outer edge of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter or inside the hadronic calorimeter. No significant excess of events is observed. Limits are reported on the product of the scalar boson production cross section times branching ratio into long-lived neutral particles as a function of the proper lifetime of the particles. Limits are reported for boson masses from 100 GeV to 900 GeV, and a long-lived neutral particle mass from 10 GeV to 150 GeV.",

If a \u03c0 v decays in the inner detector or muon spectrometer, it can be reconstructed as a displaced vertex. However, standard vertex-finding algorithms [10] are not likely to reconstruct it without modification. Likewise, a \u03c0 v decay deep inside the calorimeter is reconstructed as a jet with an unusual energy signature that most traditional searches reject as having poor data quality. This search focusses on final states where both \u03c0 v decay in the hadronic calorimeter or near the outer edge of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Each heavy fermion pair from a \u03c0 v decay is reconstructed as a single calorimeter jet with three characteristic properties: a narrow radius, no tracks from charged particles matched to the jet, and little or no energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter.",

The Tevatron experiments and CMS searched for displaced vertices in their tracking system only, which results in a corresponding proper decay length range of a few meters. CMS also looked at the multi-lepton decay channel, another possible decay of HV particles. The previous ATLAS analysis, based on 7 TeV data, used the muon spectrometer and is sensitive to proper decay lengths between 0.5 m and 27 m, depending on the benchmark model.

A good track must have at least two hits in the pixel detector and a total of at least nine hits in the pixel and SCT detectors.  Jets caused by cosmic rays and beam-halo interactions are often out-of-time. The jet timing is calculated by making an energyweighted average of the timing for each cell in the jet. Each cell is defined to have a time of 0 ns if its energy is recorded at a time consistent with the arrival of a \u03b2 = 1 particle from the IP. The timing of each jet is required to satisfy \u22121 < t < 5 ns. This cut will impact the efficiency for low \u03b2 \u03c0 v . Due to the requirement of a high-E T jet in this analysis the \u03b2-distribution is peaked near 1 for low mass samples. For the high mass samples the difference between m and m \u03c0 v results in a large boost for the \u03c0 v at the generated lifetimes. As a result, the inefficiency introduced by the timing cut is at worst 1.5% for the considered samples. The analysis requires that exactly two jets satisfy these requirements.

To calculate this systematic uncertainty the change in the mean E T as a function of \u03b7 and the change in the mean \u03b7 as a function of E T is measured in the multi-jet data sample. The maximum variation is 2% for both E T and \u03b7. The E T or \u03b7 of each jet are systematically shifted by this amount as P and Q are recalculated.

Each proton beam is divided up into buckets, most of which are filled with protons. An empty crossing occurs when an empty bucket in each beam coincides in the centre of the detector, and five buckets on either side in each beam are also empty.

The population of \u03c0 v jets is not altered by this process, but an added ISR jet may overlap with one of the \u03c0 v jets. The effect of a boost caused by an ISR jet is studied by exploiting the correlation between the \u03c0 v jet E T and the boost. From Ref.
