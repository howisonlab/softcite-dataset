The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016-2018. The two targeted signal processes are pair production of type-III seesaw heavy fermions and production of a light scalar or pseudoscalar boson in association with a pair of top quarks. The heavy fermions may be manifested as an excess of events with large values of leptonic transverse momenta or missing transverse momentum. The light scalars or pseudoscalars may create a localized excess in the dilepton mass spectra. The results exclude heavy fermions of the type-III seesaw model for masses below 880 GeV at 95% confidence level in the scenario of equal branching fractions to each lepton flavor. This is the most restrictive limit on the flavor-democratic scenario of the type-III seesaw model to date. Assuming a Yukawa coupling of unit strength to top quarks, branching fractions of new scalar (pseudoscalar) bosons to dielectrons or dimuons above 0.004 (0.03) and 0.04 (0.03) are excluded at 95% confidence level for masses in the range 15-75 and 108-340 GeV, respectively. These are the first limits in these channels on an extension of the standard model with scalar or pseudoscalar particles.",

            "text": "A search for new phenomena in final states with at least three charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented, using 137 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from 2016 to 2018. The results are interpreted in the context of two beyond the standard model (SM) theories, namely the type-III seesaw and light scalar or pseudoscalar sector extensions to the SM. The event selection and signal region definitions are chosen in a way that allows other models to be tested. Phenomenologically, these models show complementary signatures of resonant and nonresonant multilepton final states, as described below. The seesaw mechanism introduces new heavy particles coupled to leptons and to the Higgs boson, in order to explain the light masses of the neutrinos [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Within the type-III seesaw model, the neutrino is assumed to be a Majorana particle whose mass arises via the mediation of new massive fermions. These massive fermions are an SU(2) triplet of heavy Dirac charged leptons (\u03a3 \u00b1 ) and a heavy Majorana neutral lepton (\u03a3 0 ). In pp collisions, these massive fermions may be pair-produced through electroweak interactions in both charged-charged and charged-neutral pairs. Multilepton final states arise from the decays of each of the \u03a3 + \u03a3 \u2212 , \u03a3 + \u03a3 0 , and \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3 0 pairs to the nine different pairs of W, Z, and Higgs bosons with SM leptons and the subsequent leptonic decays of the SM bosons. A complete decay chain example would be \u03a3 \u00b1 \u03a3 0 \u2192 (W \u00b1 \u03bd)(W \u00b1 \u2213 ) \u2192 ( \u00b1 \u03bd\u03bd)( \u00b1 \u03bd \u2213 ), where and \u03bd are the three flavors of charged and neutral SM leptons, respectively.

Leading order Feynman diagrams for the type-III seesaw (left) and tt \u03c6 (right) signal models, depicting example production and decay modes in pp collisions. signal production and decay combinations of the seesaw signal are simulated [10]. The \u03a3 \u00b1,0 are degenerate in mass, their decays are prompt, and the \u03a3 decay branching fractions are identical across all lepton flavors (flavor-democratic scenario). This is achieved by taking the mixing angles to be V e = V \u00b5 = V \u03c4 = 10 \u22124 , values that are compatible with the existing constraints [10][11][12][13][14].",

We consider a generalization of a simple model [19,20], where a new light CP-even scalar or CP-odd pseudoscalar boson (\u03c6) is produced in pp collisions via a Yukawa coupling of the \u03c6 to top quarks, g t , either in threebody associated production with top quark pairs, or in top quark pair production with three-body top quark decays, t \u2192 bW\u03c6. The signal is collectively labeled as tt\u03c6. In this paper, we search for decays of the \u03c6 boson via a Yukawa coupling to the charged leptons, g , into dielectron or dimuon pairs within multilepton events. The decays of the \u03c6 boson into tau-tau lepton pairs are not considered. It is assumed that g g t and that all other couplings of the \u03c6 boson are negligible. Furthermore, the \u03c6 boson decays are taken to be prompt, and the \u03c6 branching fractions into different flavors of charged lepton pairs, B(\u03c6 \u2192 ), as well as g t , are left as free parameters. Figure 1 illustrates example diagrams for the production and decay of heavy fermions in the type-III seesaw model (left) and a light scalar or pseudoscalar boson in the tt\u03c6 model (right).",

The CMS detector uses a two-tiered trigger system [26]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most relevant pp collision events at rates up to 100 kHz. These are further processed by a second level consisting of a farm of processors, known as the high level trigger, that combines information from all CMS subdetectors to yield a final event rate of less than 1 kHz for data storage.",

A combination of isolated single-electron and single-muon triggers was used with corresponding transverse momentum (p T ) thresholds of 24 and 27 GeV in 2016, 27 and 32 GeV in 2017, and 24 and 32 GeV in 2018. Event samples from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to estimate the rates of signal and relevant SM background processes. The WZ, Z\u03b3, ttZ, ttW, and triboson backgrounds are generated using MadGraph5 amc@nlo (2.2.2 in 2016, 2.4.2 in 2017 and 2018 data analyses) [27] at next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. The top quark mass used in all simulations is 172.5 GeV. The ZZ background contribution from quark-antiquark annihilation is generated using powheg 2.0 [28][29][30] at NLO, whereas the contribution from gluon-gluon fusion is generated at leading order (LO) using mcfm 7.0.1 [31]. Backgrounds from Higgs boson production for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV are generated at NLO using powheg and JHUGen 7.0.11 [32][33][34][35]. Simulated event samples for Drell-Yan (DY) and tt processes, generated at NLO with MadGraph5 amc@nlo and powheg, respectively, are used for systematic uncertainty studies. All signal samples are simulated using MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.6.1 at LO precision. The production cross section for the type-III seesaw signal model \u03c3(\u03a3\u03a3) is calculated at NLO plus next-to-leading logarithmic precision, assuming that the heavy leptons are SU (2) triplet fermions [36,37], while the tt\u03c6 production cross section \u03c3(tt\u03c6) comes directly from the MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.6.1 generator at LO precision.",

The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers.

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5-10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. The effect of the pileup on reconstructed jets is mitigated through a charged hadron subtraction technique, which removes the energy of charged hadrons not originating from the PV [45].

The event yields of these processes are obtained from theoretical predictions, with normalization corrections derived in dedicated control regions as described below. These estimates for the WZ, ZZ and Z\u03b3 processes are largely independent of each other. Since these backgrounds make significant contributions to the ttZ-enriched control region, the normalization correction for this process is measured after the corresponding corrections have been obtained for the other backgrounds. The normalization correction factors and their associated uncertainties, which include both statistical and systematic contributions, take the contamination of events from other processes into account and are applied to the corresponding background estimates in the signal regions. For the WZ and ttZ processes, we select events with exactly three leptons with an on-Z OSSF pair, and the minimum lepton p T is required to be above 20 GeV to increase the purity of these selections in the targeted process. For the WZ-enriched selection, we require 50 < p miss T < 100 GeV and zero b tagged jets, whereas for the ttZ-enriched selection we require p miss T < 100 GeV, S T > 350 GeV, and at least one b tagged jet. Similarly, for ZZ, we select events with exactly four leptons, p miss T < 100 GeV, and two distinct on-Z OSSF lepton pairs. In the WZ-and ZZ-enriched selections, the simulated event yields are normalized to match those in the data in the 0-3 and 0-2 jet multiplicity bins including overflows, respectively, yielding normalization factor uncertainties in the range of 5-25%, whereas an inclusive normalization is performed in the ttZ-enriched selection, resulting in a 20% uncertainty. The various kinematic distributions in the WZ-, ZZ-, and ttZenriched control regions, where the normalizations of these major irreducible backgrounds are performed, are illustrated in figure 2 (top-left, top-right, bottom-left).",

The uncertainties due to such corrections typically correspond to a 1-10% variation of the simulation-based irreducible background and signal yields across all signal regions. Therefore, they form a sub-dominant category of systematic uncertainties in the simulation-based background estimation. Similarly, uncertainties due to choices of factorization and renormalization scales [56] and PDFs [39] are also evaluated for signal and dominant irreducible background processes, yielding <10% variation in signal regions. The uncertainties in the integrated luminosity are in the range of 2.3-2.5% in each year of data collection [57][58][59].",

These are estimated using a three-dimensional implementation of a matrix method [60], in which the rates at which prompt and misidentified leptons satisfying a loose lepton selection also pass a tight lepton selection are measured in dedicated signal-depleted selections of events in data. The misidentification rates are measured in Z+jets and tt+jets enriched trilepton (on-Z, p miss T < 50 GeV) and same-sign dilepton (off-Z, p miss T > 50 GeV, and with at least 3 jets) selections, respectively, whereas an on-Z dilepton selection is used for the prompt rates. The rates are parametrized as a function of lepton kinematic distributions and the multiplicity of tracks in the event. A weighted average of these misidentification rates is used in the analysis, reflecting the approximate expected composition of the SM backgrounds in a given search region as obtained from simulated event samples. The final uncertainty in the estimated background from misidentified leptons is obtained by varying the rates within the uncertainties as well as the differences in rates in Z+jets and tt+jets events, and has a relative uncertainty of 30-40%.

We perform a goodness-of-fit test based on the saturated model method [61] to quantify the local deviations between the background-only hypothesis and the observed data, without considering the look-elsewhere effect [62]. The most significant local deviation from the SM expectation in the signal regions is found in the 3L(\u00b5\u00b5) 1B S T < 400 GeV high mass tt\u03c6 channel (figure 9) by selecting the bins with M 300 OSSF > 206 GeV, resulting in a data excess of approximately 3.2 standard deviations. Similarly, by examining other deviations from the SM, we observe a local data deficit of 2.5 standard deviations in the 10 < M 20 OSSF < 15 GeV bin of the 3L(ee) 0B 400 < S T < 800 GeV channel (figure 5), and a local data excess of 2.5 standard deviations in the 60 < M 20 OSSF < 65 GeV bin of the 3L(\u00b5\u00b5) 1B 400 < S T < 800 GeV channel (figure 9).

The 95% confidence level expected and observed upper limits on the total production cross section of heavy fermion pairs. The inner (green) and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68 and 95%, respectively, of the distribution of limits expected under the background-only hypothesis. Also shown are the theoretical prediction for the cross section and the associated uncertainty of the \u03a3 pair production via the type-III seesaw mechanism. Type-III seesaw heavy fermions are excluded for masses below 880 GeV (expected limit 930 GeV) in the flavor-democratic scenario. model are shown in figures 12 and 13, respectively. In the tt\u03c6 signal model, we exclude cross sections above 1-20 fb for \u03c6 masses in the range of 15-75 GeV, and above 0.3-5 fb for \u03c6 masses in the range of 108-340 GeV. Furthermore, g 2 t B(\u03c6 \u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5) above (0.4-4)\u00d710 -3 for the scalar and above (0.4-3)\u00d710 -2 for the pseudoscalar scenarios are excluded for \u03c6 masses in the 15-75 GeV range, whereas the two models perform similarly for masses 108-340 GeV and are excluded above (0.4-4)\u00d710 -2 for the scalar and above (0.6-3)\u00d710 -2 for the pseudoscalar scenarios. Uncertainties in the production cross sections due to scale and PDF choices are considered for both signal models [36,37,67], and are also shown in figures 11 and 12. The differences in the low-mass exclusion limits of scalar and pseudoscalar tt\u03c6 models result from the kinematic structure of the couplings, which affect both the production cross section and the signal efficiency of the \u03c6 bosons. The coupling of a scalar boson to a fermion is momentum independent, whereas that of a pseudoscalar boson is proportional to the momentum in the low momentum limit. Therefore, the low \u03c6 momentum part of the production cross section is suppressed in the pseudoscalar model in comparison to the scalar model for \u03c6 masses below the top quark mass scale, while both production cross sections are similar for \u03c6 masses at and above the top quark mass scale. Furthermore, this coupling structure results in more pseudoscalar \u03c6 bosons in the Lorentz-boosted region -21 -    Figure 12. The 95% confidence level expected and observed upper limits on the product of the signal production cross section and branching fraction of a scalar \u03c6 boson in the dielectron (upper left) and dimuon (lower left) channels, and of a pseudoscalar \u03c6 boson in the dielectron (upper right) and dimuon (lower right) channels, where \u03c6 is produced in association with a top quark pair. The inner (green) and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68 and 95%, respectively, of the distribution of limits expected under the background-only hypothesis. The vertical hatched gray band indicates the mass region corresponding to the Z boson veto. Also shown are the theoretical predictions for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction of the tt \u03c6 model, with their uncertainties, and assuming g 2 t B(\u03c6 \u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5) = 0.05. All tt \u03c6 signal scenarios are excluded for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction above 1-20 fb for \u03c6 masses in the range of 15-75 GeV, and above 0.3-5 fb for \u03c6 masses in the range of 108-340 GeV.",
