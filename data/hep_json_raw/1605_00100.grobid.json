The nature of dark matter, the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe, the understanding of the very small neutrino masses are big questions, still missing an answer. These answers cannot be found within the Standard Model (SM).",

Z Z production mimics the H \u2192 inv Z \u2192 + \u2212 signal events when one Z decays to leptons and the other to neutrinos. These events are characterized by a peak in the missing mass distribution at the Z pole, with a tail to larger values originating from initial state radiation (ISR) of a photon close to the beam axis. Opposite charge, same flavor leptons originating from independent W decays in W W events may have an invariant mass close to the Z pole and thus be miss-tagged as a real Z boson recoiling against invisible particles. Due to the large W W cross section, this background is not negligible. Additional processes like e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z \u03bd\u03bd (see Fig. 1) are found to be negligible [4], given the small cross section. Moreover, we verified that events with radiative return to the Z peak are completely rejected by the selection criteria discussed in Sect. 4, and that we can safely neglect any sources of acoplanar leptons in \u03b3 \u03b3 processes.",

In an ideal situation, one would push for the best possible tracking resolution. On the other hand, in final states like the one considered in this study the experimental resolution also depends on the knowledge of the collision energy. At a high-luminosity e + e \u2212 collider, beam-beam interactions introduce an energy spread which randomizes the electron and positron momenta. The typical spread is quite small (0.2%) and when computing the missing mass with a CMS-like detector this effect is not visible in the missing mass resolution. However, the energy spread becomes a limiting factor if one pushes the tracking resolution at the high-precision expected for the ILD-like design.",
