The combinations include the results of the analyses of the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3, Z Z * , W W * , Z \u03b3, bb, \u03c4\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03bc decay modes, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton-proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is 1.18 +0.15   \u22120.14 . The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model particle content in loop processes. The data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.",

            "text": "In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported the observation of a new particle at a mass of approximately 125 GeV [1,2]. The discovery made in the search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson (H ), is a milestone in the quest to understand electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Within the SM, EWSB is achieved through the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism [3][4][5][6][7][8] which predicts the existence of a neutral scalar particle, commonly known as the Higgs boson. While the SM does not predict the value of its mass (m H ), the produce-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch tion cross sections and decay branching ratios (BR) of the Higgs boson can be precisely calculated once the mass is known. Therefore, precision measurements of the properties of the new particle are critical in ascertaining whether the newly discovered particle is fully responsible for EWSB and whether there are potential deviations from SM predictions.",

These analyses are designed for maximum sensitivities to SM Higgs boson production from different processes, exploiting in particular the differences in kinematics through categorisation of the selected events. Thus the yields of different Higgs boson production processes and decays can be extracted. The Higgs boson coupling strengths to SM vector bosons and fermions in different benchmark models are probed for the measured Higgs boson mass of m H = 125.36 GeV. All results are obtained assuming the Higgs boson has a small total decay width such that its production and decay factorise. The ATLAS Collaboration has previously published combined studies of Higgs boson production and decay rates [23] and of spin-parity properties [24,25] using diboson final states. The results are found to be consistent with expectations from the SM Higgs boson. Compared with the previous publication, the current results are based on the improved analysis sensitivities and the addition of information from other decay modes. A similar combination has been published by the CMS Collaboration [26].",

In Sect. 4, the measured Higgs boson yields are compared with the SM predictions for different production processes and decay modes. In Sect. 5, the coupling strengths of the Higgs boson are tested through fits to the observed data. These studies probe possible deviations from the SM predictions under various assumptions, motivated in many cases by beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics scenarios. An upper limit on the branching ratio to invisible or undetected decay modes of the Higgs boson is also set. Finally, a brief summary is presented in Sect. 6.",

            "text": "The theoretical calculations of the Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios have been compiled in Refs. [30][31][32] and are summarised in Table 1. For the ggF process, the cross section is computed at up to NNLO in QCD corrections [33][34][35][36][37][38] and NLO in electroweak (EW) corrections [39][40][41]. The effects of QCD soft-gluon resummations at up to NNLL [42] are also applied. These calculations are described in Refs. [43][44][45][46][47]. For the VBF process, full QCD and EW corrections up to NLO [48][49][50] and approximate NNLO [51,52] QCD corrections are used to calculate the cross section. The cross sections of the W H and Z H (qq \u2192 Z H) are calculated including QCD corrections up to NNLO [53,54] and EW corrections up to NLO [55,56] whereas the cross section of the gg \u2192 Z H process is calculated up to NLO in QCD corrections [57,58]. The cross section for tt H is computed up to NLO in QCD [59][60][61][62]. For the bbH process, the cross section is calculated in QCD corrections up to NLO [63][64][65] in the four-flavour scheme and up to NNLO [66] in the five-flavour scheme with the Santander matching scheme [67]. The cross sections of the t H processes used are calculated at up to NLO in QCD corrections [68,69]. The PDF sets used in these calculations are CT10 [70,71], MSTW2008 [72], NNPDF2.1 [73,74] and NNPDF2.3 [75] following the prescription of Ref. [76]. The decay branching ratios of the Higgs boson are calculated using the Hdecay [77,78] and Prophecy4f [79,80] programs, compiled in Ref. [81].",

            "text": "All analyses use Monte Carlo (MC) samples to model the acceptances of the Higgs boson events. Table 2 summarises the event generators and parton distribution functions (PDF) used for the analyses of the \u221a s = 8 TeV data. The modelling at \u221a s = 7 TeV is similar, with one notable difference of Pythia6 [83] replacing Pythia8 [84]. The ggF and VBF production of the Higgs boson are simulated with the next-toleading order (NLO) matrix-element Powheg program [85][86][87][88][89] interfaced to either Pythia6 or Pythia8 for the simulation of the underlying event, parton showering and hadronisation (referred to as the showering program). The Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution from ggF production is reweighted to match the calculation of HRes2.1 [90,91], which includes QCD corrections up to the next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (NNLL) in perturbative expansions. Furthermore, ggF events with two or more jets are reweighted to match the transverse momentum distribution from MiNLO HJJ predictions [92]. The W H and Z H (qq \u2192 Z H) production processes are simulated with the leading-order (LO) Pythia8 program. The gg \u2192 Z H process contributes approximately 8 % to the total Z H production cross section in the SM. For most of the analyses, the process is modelled using Table 1 SM predictions of the Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios and their uncertainties for m H = 125.36 GeV, obtained by linear interpolations from those at 125.3 and 125.4 GeV from Ref. [32] except for the t H production cross section which is obtained from Refs. [20,82]. The uncertainties of the cross sections are the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties resulting from variations of QCD scales, parton distribution functions and \u03b1 s . The uncertainty on the t H cross section is calculated following the procedure in Refs. [20,32] Production process Cross section (pb) qq \u2192 Z H of Pythia8. Only the V H analysis in the H \u2192 bb decay mode specifically models gg \u2192 Z H production using Powheg [85][86][87] interfaced to Pythia8. The tt H process is modelled using the NLO calculation in the HELAC-Oneloop package [93] interfaced to Powheg and Pythia8 for the subsequent simulation. The t H production process is simulated using MadGraph [94] interfaced to Pythia8 for qb \u2192 t Hq and using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [82] interfaced to Herwig++ [95] for gb \u2192 W t H. The bbH production process contributes approximately 1 % [96] to the total Higgs boson cross section in the SM. It is simulated with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO program for some analyses. The event kinematics of ggF and bbH production are found to be similar for analysis categories that are most important for bbH . Thus the acceptance times efficiency for bbH is assumed to be the same as for ggF for all analyses.",

Three sub-channels (\u03c4 lep \u03c4 lep , \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had ) are defined by orthogonal requirements on the number of reconstructed hadronic \u03c4 decays and leptons (electrons or muons) in the event. 1 Candidate events are divided into boosted and VBF categories. The boosted category targets signal events where the Higgs boson is produced with a large boost, primarily from the gluon fusion process, and requires the transverse momentum of the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate to be greater than 100 GeV. The VBF category contains events with two jets separated in pseudorapidity and targets signal events produced through the vector boson fusion process. A separate BDT is then employed in each category and sub-channel to discriminate signal from background, utilising between five and nine input variables, chosen in order to exploit discriminating features such as Higgs boson decay properties, event activity, and the VBF topology in the corresponding category. One of the most important input variables is the mass of the \u03c4 \u03c4 system, which is quite challenging to reconstruct due to the presence of at least two neutrinos in the final state; the Missing Mass Calculator [101] is used for this purpose.",

Uncertainty components from statistics, systematics, and signal theory are also shown.

The \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV combined values with their total uncertainties are also illustrated in Fig. 3. The \u221a s = 7 TeV data are included in the combinations only, as they have limited statistical power to distinguish between different production modes.

As a multiplicative factor common to all rates in this parameterisation, \u03c3 (gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W * ) is pulled up in the fit to accommodate the observed large global signal-strength value (Sect. 4.1). The best-fit value of \u03c3 (gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W * ) is approximately 15 % above the SM prediction, to be compared to the significantly lower value of 0.98 +0.29 \u22120.26 , found from the stand-alone measurement from the H \u2192 W W * decay (see Fig. 1). Moreover, there are by construction large anti-correlations between \u03c3 (gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W * ), \u03c3 i /\u03c3 ggF and f / W W * . Table 8 shows the observed and expected significances in units of standard deviations of the VBF, W H, Z H and tt H production processes. Listed under V H are the combined significances of W H and Z H production, assuming the SM value for their relative cross sections. The significance is calculated from a likelihood scan, where the contributions from other processes are fixed at their best-fit values. As the gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W * process is chosen as the reference, the significances are calculated using the observable \u03c3 (gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W * ) for the ggF process and the crosssection ratios \u03c3 i /\u03c3 ggF for all other processes. The crosssection ratios are independent of the Higgs boson decay branching ratios and have the advantage of the cancellation of many experimental uncertainties. The result provides an unequivocal confirmation of the gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson with its significance exceeding well above five standard deviations. Furthermore, the result also offers strong evidence, at 4.3 standard deviations, of vector-boson fusion production and supports the SM assumptions of production in association with vector bosons or a pair of top quarks.",

The SM cross section for t H production is consequently small, about 14 % of the tt H cross section. However, for negative \u03ba t the interference becomes constructive and, following Table 9, the cross section increases by a factor of 6 (13) for | \u03ba t | = | \u03ba W | = 1 for the gb \u2192 W t H (qg \u2192 t Hbq ) process, making the t H process sensitive to the relative sign of the W and top-quark coupling strength, despite its small SM cross section. The modelling of t H production is not present in the framework described in Ref. [32]. The bbH (Fig. 9a) production process directly probes the Higgs boson coupling strength to b-quarks, with scale factor \u03ba b .

What then remains of BSM effects on the gg \u2192 Z H process are modifications of the Higgs boson couplings to the top quark ( Fig. 8b) and the Z boson (Fig. 8c), which are taken into account within the limitation of the framework by the coupling-strength scale factors \u03ba t and \u03ba Z .",

To make measurements of absolute coupling strengths, an assumption about the Higgs boson width must be introduced. The simplest assumption is that there are no invisible or undetected Higgs boson decays, i.e. BR i.,u. = 0 is assumed in Eq. (8). An alternative, less strong assumption, is that \u03ba W \u2264 1 and \u03ba Z \u2264 1 [32]. This assumption is theoretically motivated by the premise that the Higgs boson should solve the unitarity problem in vector boson scattering and also holds in a wide class of BSM models. In particular, it is valid in any model with an arbitrary number of Higgs doublets, with and without additional Higgs singlets. The assumption is also justified in certain classes of composite Higgs boson models. A second alternative is to assume that the coupling strengths in off-shell Higgs boson production are identical to those for onshell Higgs boson production. Under the assumption that the off-shell signal strength and coupling-strength scale factors are independent of the energy scale of Higgs boson production, the total Higgs boson decay width can be determined from the ratio of off-shell to on-shell signal strengths [21]. The constraint BR i.,u. \u2265 0, motivated by the basic assumption that the total width of the Higgs boson must be greater or equal to the sum of the measured partial widths, always introduces a lower bound on the Higgs boson width. The difference in effect of these assumptions is therefore mostly in the resulting upper limit on the Higgs boson width. The assumptions made for the various measurements are summarised in Table 10 and discussed in the next sections together with the results.",

The coupling-strength scale factors of known SM particles are still assumed to be at their SM values of 1.

All fundamental coupling-strength scale factors, as well as the loop-coupling scale factors \u03ba g and \u03ba \u03b3 are measured to be compatible with their SM expectation under all explored assumptions, while limits are set on the loop-coupling scale factor \u03ba Z\u03b3 and the fraction of Higgs boson decays to invisible or undetected decays.

These results are illustrated in Fig. 23. The confidence interval of BR i.,u. in the benchmark model with the constraints \u03ba W < 1 and |\u03ba Z | < 1, and the confidence intervals \u03ba W and \u03ba Z , are estimated with respect to their physical bounds, as described in the text. Shown in square brackets are uncertainty components from different sources for the case of BR i.,u. = 0 as an illustration. For \u03ba Z and \u03ba t , the uncertainty breakdowns are provided for the preferred positive solutions. Also shown is the uncertainty on the total width that the model variants allow, expressed as the ratio H / SM H . These estimates for the width are obtained from alternative parameterisations of these benchmark models where the effective coupling-strength scale factor \u03ba g is replaced by the expression that results from solving Eq. (8)  upper limit is BR i.,u. < 0.49 (0.68) under the constraint \u03ba V < 1 (\u03ba on = \u03ba off ) on the Higgs boson total width. The nine-dimensional compatibility of the SM hypothesis with the best-fit point is 73 % when BR i.,u. is fixed to zero. The compatibilities for the fits with the conditions \u03ba V < 1 and \u03ba on = \u03ba off imposed are 80 and 57 %, respectively. Similar to the results of the benchmark model in Sect. 5.2.2 the upper bound of the 68 % CL interval for the scenario \u03ba on = \u03ba off should be considered to be only approximate due to deviations of the test-statistic distribution from its asymptotic form. The deviation of the asymptotic distribution was shown to be negligible for off-shell signal strengths corresponding to the upper end of the 95 % asymptotic confidence interval (Table 11).",

Here the red curve corresponds to the configuration of generic model 2, and the orange curve corresponds to the configuration of generic model 1. As expected, resolving gg \u2192 Z H process adds little information on \u03ba t . Additionally resolving the ggF loop process into its SM content greatly improves the precision on \u03ba t (green curve), but reduces the sensitivity to the relative sign of \u03ba t and \u03ba W . This reduction happens because on one hand the ggF process yields no new information on this relative sign, as it is dominated by t-b interference, and on the other hand because it decreases the observed magnitude of \u03ba t to a more SM-compatible level, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the t H process to the relative sign. Further resolving the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H \u2192 Z \u03b3 loop processes, which are dominated by W -t interference, greatly improves the measurement of the relative sign of \u03ba W and \u03ba t (orange curve), but does not significantly contribute to the precision of the magnitude of \u03ba t .",

The free parameters are chosen as:  The parameter \u03bb WZ = \u03ba W /\u03ba Z in this model is of particular interest: identical coupling-strength scale factors for the W and Z bosons are required within tight bounds by the SU(2) custodial symmetry and the \u03c1 parameter measurements at  cates the cutoff value of the profile likelihood ratio corresponding to a 68 % (95 %) confidence interval for the parameter of interest, assuming the asymptotic \u03c7 2 distribution for the test statistic LEP and at the Tevatron [120]. This custodial constraint is directly probed in the Higgs sector through the parameter \u03bb WZ . The measured ratio \u03bb WZ is in part directly constrained by the decays in the H \u2192 W W * \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd and H \u2192 Z Z * \u2192 4 channels and the W H and Z H production processes. It is also indirectly constrained by the VBF production process, which in the SM is 74 % W fusion-mediated and 26 % Z fusion-mediated (see Table 9). Figure 27a shows the profile likelihood ratio as a function of the coupling-strength scale factor ratio \u03bb WZ . Due to the interference terms, the fit is sensitive to the relative sign of the W and t coupling (t H) and the relative sign of the Z and t coupling (gg \u2192 Z H), providing indirect sensitivity to the sign of \u03bb WZ . The negative solution is disfavoured at 0.5\u03c3 (0.3\u03c3 expected).

The results shown in Table 13 are nearly identical to the best-fit values relative to their SM predictions shown in Table 7. The small differences are expected from the inclusion of additional nuisance parameters of the SM predictions and from the precision of the fits. One clear advantage of the parameterisation of Sect. 4.4 is that the results are independent of the SM predictions and are, therefore, not affected by the theoretical uncertainties of the predictions. Consequently, the fitted values of the ratios of cross sections and of partial decay widths shown in Table 7 have significantly smaller theoretical uncertainties than their counterparts (R i/ggF and \u03c1 r/W W * ) in Table 13. The former is only affected by the theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of Higgs boson production whereas the latter suffer from both the modelling uncertainties and the uncertainties of the SM predictions.",

The sensitivity to disfavour the negative solution of \u03ba t is reduced with respect to generic model 1 as the interference in loop couplings can no longer be exploited because effective coupling-strength scale factors were introduced. The observed residual sensitivity to the sign of \u03ba t is exclusively due to the tree-level interference effect of the t H background in the tt H channel.The power of individual loop processes to measure the magnitude of \u03ba t and resolve the sign of \u03ba t relative to \u03ba W is illustrated in more detail inFig. 25.
