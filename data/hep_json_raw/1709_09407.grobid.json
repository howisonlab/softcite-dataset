Both absolute and normalised differential cross-sections are measured, using events with an opposite-charge e\u03bc pair and one or two btagged jets. The cross-sections are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the detector acceptance for leptons, and are compared to the predictions from a variety of Monte Carlo event generators, as well as fixed-order QCD calculations, exploring the sensitivity of the cross-sections to the gluon parton distribution function. Some of the distributions are also sensitive to the top quark pole mass; a combined fit of NLO fixed-order predictions to all the measured distributions yields a top quark mass value of m pole t = 173.2 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 1.2 GeV, where the three uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental systematics, and theoretical sources.

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle, with a mass (m t ) that is much larger than any of the other quarks, and close to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. The study of its production and decay properties in proton-proton ( pp) collisions forms an important part of the ATLAS physics program at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Due to its large mass and production cross-section, top quark production is also a significant background to many searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, making precise predictions of absolute rates and differential distributions for top quark production a vital tool in fully exploiting the discovery potential of the LHC. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch At the LHC, top quarks are primarily produced as quarkantiquark pairs (tt). The inclusive tt production cross-section \u03c3 tt has been calculated at full next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [1][2][3][4][5]. The resulting prediction at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV is \u03c3 tt = 252.9 \u00b1 11.7",

            "text": "Going beyond the inclusive production cross-section, measurements of tt production as a function of the top quark and tt system kinematics properties allow the predictions of QCD calculations and Monte Carlo event-generator programs to be probed in more detail. These comparisons are typically more sensitive at the level of normalised differential cross-sections, i.e. shape comparisons, where both experimental and theoretical uncertainties are reduced. Measurements by ATLAS [18][19][20][21] and CMS [22][23][24] have generally demonstrated good agreement with the predictions of leading-order (LO) multi-leg and next-to-leading-order (NLO) event generators and calculations, though the top quark p T spectrum is measured to be softer than the predictions by both experiments; this distribution appears to be sensitive to the additional corrections contributing at NNLO [25]. Measurements of jet activity in tt events [26][27][28][29] are also sensitive to gluon radiation and hence the tt production dynamics, without the need to fully reconstruct the kinematics of the tt system. However, all these measurements require sophisticated unfolding procedures to correct for the detector acceptance and resolution. This leads to significant systematic uncertainties, especially due to modelling of the showers and hadronisation of the quarks produced in the top quark decays, and the measurement of the resulting jets in the detector.",

            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM), the top quark decays almost exclusively to a W boson and a b quark, and the final state topologies in tt production are governed by the decay modes of the W bosons. The channel where one W boson decays to an electron (W \u2192 e\u03bd) and the other to a muon (W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd), giving rise to the e + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03bdbb final state, 1 is particularly clean and was exploited to make the most precise ATLAS measurements of \u03c3 tt [13,17]. The leptons carry information about the underlying top quark kinematics, are free of the uncertainties related to the hadronic part of the final state, and are precisely measured in the detector. Measurements of the tt differential cross-section as a function of the lepton kinematics therefore have the potential to provide a complementary view of tt production and decay dynamics to that provided by the complete reconstruction of the tt final state. This paper reports such a measurement of the absolute and normalised differential cross-sections for tt \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bdbb produced in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, as a function of the kinematics of the single leptons and of the dilepton system. Eight differential cross-section distributions are measured: the transverse momentum p T and absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | of the single leptons (identical for electrons and muons), the p T , invariant mass and absolute rapidity of the dilepton system ( p e\u03bc T , m e\u03bc and |y e\u03bc |), the azimuthal angle in the transverse plane \u03c6 e\u03bc between the two leptons, the scalar sum p e T + p \u03bc T of the p T of the two leptons, and the sum E e + E \u03bc of the energies of the two leptons. 2 The measurements are corrected to particle level and reported in a fiducial volume where both leptons have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, avoiding extrapolations into regions of leptonic phase space which are not measured. The particle-level definition includes the contribution of events where one or both W bosons decay to electrons or muons via leptonic decays of \u03c4 -leptons (t \u2192 W \u2192 \u03c4 \u2192 e/\u03bc), but an alternative set of 1 Charge-conjugate decay modes are implied unless otherwise stated. 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector, and the z axis along the beam line. Pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan \u03b8/2, and transverse momentum and energy are defined relative to the beamline as p T = p sin \u03b8 and E T = E sin \u03b8. The azimuthal angle around the beam line is denoted by \u03c6, and distances in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space by R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . The rapidity is defined as",

The definition of the fiducial volume does not make any requirement on the presence of jets from the hadronic decay products of the tt system. The measurements are made using events with an opposite-charge e\u03bc pair and one or two b-tagged jets, and extrapolated to the fiducial volume (without jet requirements), using an extension of the double-tagging technique used in the inclusive tt cross-section measurement [13]. This approach minimises the systematic uncertainties due to the use of jets and b-tagging in the experimental event selection. Since the lepton kinematics are precisely measured in the ATLAS detector, a simple bin-by-bin correction technique is adequate to correct for efficiency and resolution effects, without the need for a full unfolding procedure.",

[32], and mass measurements are made by comparing the measured distributions to predictions from both NLO plus parton shower event generators and fixed-order QCD calculations. The former are similar to traditional measurements where the top quark mass is reconstructed from its decay products [33][34][35][36], but rely only on the leptonic decay products of the tt system and are less sensitive to experimental uncertainties related to the hadronic part of the final state. The measurements based on fixed-order QCD predictions in a well-defined renormalisation scheme correspond more directly to a measurement of the top quark pole mass m pole t , the mass definition corresponding to that of a free particle, which may differ from that measured in direct reconstruction of the decay products by O(1 GeV) [37][38][39]. Previous determinations of m pole t from inclusive and differential tt cross-section measurements are compatible with the top quark mass measured from direct reconstruction, with uncertainties of [2][3]15,40,41].",

The analysis was performed on a sample of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . Events were required to pass a single-electron or single-muon trigger, with thresholds set to be fully efficient for leptons with p T > 25 GeV passing offline selections. Each triggered event also includes the signals from on average 20 additional inelastic pp collisions in the same bunch crossing, referred to as pileup. Monte Carlo simulated event samples were used to develop the analysis procedures, to compare with data, and to evaluate signal efficiencies and background contributions. An overview of the samples used for signal and background modelling is shown in Table 1, and further details are given below. Samples were processed using either the full ATLAS detector simulation [43] based on GEANT4 [44], or a faster simulation making use of parameterised showers in the calorimeters [45]. The effects of pileup were simulated by generating additional inelastic pp collisions with Pythia8 [46] using the A2 parameter set (tune) [47] and overlaying them on the primary simulated events. These combined events were then processed using the same reconstruction and analysis chain as the data. Small corrections were applied to the lepton trigger and selection efficiencies better to model the performance measured in data.",

The Powheg parameter h damp , used in the damping function that limits the resummation of higher-order effects incorporated into the Sudakov form factor, was set to m t . This value was found to give a better modelling of the tt system p T at \u221a s = 7 TeV [55] than the setting of h damp = \u221e used for the baseline tt sample in Ref.

            "text": "Alternative tt simulation samples used to evaluate systematic uncertainties were generated with Powheg interfaced to Herwig (version 6.520) [56,57] with the ATLAS AUET2 tune [58] and Jimmy (version 4.31) [59] for underlying event modelling, with MC@NLO (version 4.01) [60,61] interfaced to Herwig + Jimmy, and with the leading-order 'multi-leg' event generator Alpgen (version 2.13) [62], also interfaced to Herwig + Jimmy. The Alpgen samples used leading-order matrix elements for tt production accompanied by up to three additional light partons, and dedicated matrix elements for tt plus bb or cc production, together with the MLM parton-jet matching scheme [63] to account for double-counting of configurations generated by both the parton shower and matrix-element calculation. The effects of additional radiation in tt events were further studied using two additional Powheg + Pythia6 samples, one using the Perugia 2012 radHi tune [54], with h damp set to 2m t and factorisation and renormalisation scales \u03bc F and \u03bc R reduced from their event generator defaults by a factor of two, giving more parton shower radiation; and one with the Perugia 2012 radLo tune [54], \u03bc F and \u03bc R increased by a factor of two and h damp = m t , giving less parton shower radiation. The parameters of these samples were chosen to span the uncertainties in jet observables measured by ATLAS in tt events at \u221a s = 7 TeV [26, 55,64]. The top quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV in all these samples, consistent with recent measurements by ATLAS [35] and CMS [36]. They were all normalised to the NNLO + NNLL cross-section prediction discussed in Sect. 1 when comparing simulation with data. Further tt simulation samples with different event generator setups were used for comparisons with the measured differential cross-sections as discussed in Sect. 6.2, and in the extraction of the top quark mass as discussed in Sect. 8.",

            "text": "Backgrounds to the tt event selection are classified into two types: those with two real prompt leptons from W or Z boson decays (including those produced via leptonic \u03c4 decays), and those where one of the reconstructed lepton candidates is misidentified, i.e. a non-prompt lepton from the decay of a bottom or charm hadron, an electron from a photon conversion, hadronic jet activity misidentified as an electron, or a muon produced from the decay in flight of a pion or kaon. The first category is dominated by the associated production of a W boson and a single top quark, W t, that is simulated using Powheg + Pythia6 with the CT10 PDFs and the P2011C tune. The 'diagram removal' scheme was used to handle the interference between the tt and W t final states that occurs at NLO [65,66]. Smaller backgrounds result from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 (\u2192 e\u03bc)+jets, modelled using Alpgen + Pythia6 including leading-order matrix elements for Zbb production, and diboson (W W , W Z and Z Z) production in association with jets, modelled with Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy. The W t background was normalised to the approximate NNLO cross-section of 22.4 \u00b1 1.5 pb, determined as in Ref. [67]. The inclusive Z cross-section was set to the NNLO prediction from FEWZ [68], but the normalisation of the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 background with b-tagged jets was determined with the help of data control samples as discussed in Sect. 4.2. The small diboson background was normalised to the NLO QCD inclusive cross-section predictions calculated with MCFM [69], using the Alpgen + Herwig prediction for the fraction of diboson events with extra jets. Production of tt in association with a W or Z boson, which contributes to the control sample with two same-charge leptons, was simulated with Mad-Graph [70] interfaced to Pythia6 with CTEQ6L1 PDFs, and normalised to NLO cross-section predictions [71,72].",

In brief, electron candidates [76] were required to satisfy E T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47, and to not lie within the transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52 between the barrel and endcap electromagnetic calorimeters. Muon candidates [77] were required to satisfy p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. In order to reduce background from non-prompt leptons, electrons were required to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity using both calorimeter and tracking information, and muons were required to be isolated using tracking information alone. Jets were reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [78,79] with radius parameter R = 0.4 using calorimeter energy clusters calibrated with the local cluster weighting method [80]. Jets were further calibrated using information from both simulation and data [81,82], and required to satisfy p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jets satisfying p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 were additionally required to pass pileup rejection criteria based on their associated tracks [82]. To further suppress non-isolated leptons likely to originate from heavy-flavour decays within jets, electron and muon candidates within R < 0.4 of selected jets were discarded. Finally, jets likely to contain b-hadrons were b-tagged using the MV1 algorithm [83], a multivariate discriminant making use of track impact parameters and reconstructed secondary vertices. A tagging working point corresponding to a 70% efficiency for tagging b-quark jets from top decays in tt events was used, giving a rejection factor of about 140 against light-quark and gluon jets, and about five against jets originating from charm quarks.",

Events having muons compatible with cosmic-ray interactions or losing substantial energy following bremsstrahlung in the calorimeter material were rejected. A preselection requiring exactly one electron and one muon selected as described above was then applied, requiring at least one selected lepton to be matched to a corresponding electron or muon trigger signature. Events with an opposite-charge-sign e\u03bc pair formed the main analysis sample, with events having a same-sign pair being used to estimate the background from misidentified leptons. A total of 66,453 data events passed the opposite-sign e\u03bc preselection. Events were then further sub-divided according to the number of b-tagged jets, irrespective of the number of untagged jets, and events having one or two btagged jets were retained for further analysis. The numbers of one and two b-tagged jet events selected in data are shown in Table 2, compared with expected non-tt contributions from W t and dibosons evaluated from simulation, and Z (\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc)+jets and misidentified leptons evaluated from data and simulation, as discussed in detail in Sects. 4.2 and 5 below. 4 In simulation, the one b-tagged sample is about 88% pure and the two b-tagged sample 96% pure in tt events, with the largest backgrounds coming from W t production in both cases. The distribution of the number of b-tagged jets in preselected opposite-sign e\u03bc events is shown in Fig. 1a, compared to the predictions from simulation using Powheg + Pythia6 (PY6), MC@NLO + Herwig (HW) and Alpgen + Herwig tt samples, normalising the total simulation prediction in each case using the integrated luminosity of the data sample.

An initial set of 1000 pseudo-experiments was performed using the baseline simulation sample as a reference, and the mean and RMS width of the deviations of the result in each bin from the reference values were used to validate the analysis procedure. The black points in Fig. 5 show the mean deviation of the results (averaged over all pseudo-experiments) for four of the measured normalised distributions, with error bars corresponding to the uncertainty in the mean due to the finite size of the simulation samples (about 17 times the data integrated luminosity). The residual biases of the mean deviations away from the reference are compatible with zero and in all cases much smaller than    the expected statistical uncertainties in data, measured by the RMS widths and shown by the cyan bands. Similar results were obtained for the other normalised differential crosssection distributions, and for the absolute distributions. The pull distributions (i.e. the distributions of deviations divided by the estimated statistical uncertainty from each pseudoexperiment) were also found to have widths within a few percent of unity. The \u03c7 2 values for the compatibility of each measured distribution with the reference were also calculated for each pseudo-experiment and the distribution of the corresponding p-values across all pseudo-experiments was found to be uniform between zero and one. These tests confirm that the analysis procedure is unbiased and correctly estimates the statistical uncertainties in each bin of each distribution. Additional pseudo-experiments were performed to test the ability of the analysis procedure to reconstruct distributions different from the reference, taking the values of G For the single-lepton distributions p T and |\u03b7 |, which have two entries per event, the formalism of Eq. (1) and the pseudoexperiments generated by fluctuating each bin independently do not take into account correlations between the kinematics of the electron and muon in each event. This effect was checked by generating pseudo-data samples corresponding to the data integrated luminosity from individual simulated events, taken at random from a large tt sample combining both full and fast simulation and corresponding to about 70 times the data integrated luminosity. The effect of neglecting the electron-muon correlations within an event was found to correspond to at most a 2% fractional overestimate of the absolute and 2% fractional underestimate of the normalised cross-section uncertainties.

As also found in the inclusive cross-section analy-sis [13], a substantial part of the differences in G i e\u03bc in the various samples arises from differences in the hadronic activity close to the leptons, which affects the efficiency of the lepton isolation requirements. These efficiencies were therefore measured in situ in tt events selected in data as discussed in Sect. 5.2 below, and the simulation uncertainties on G due to limited knowledge of the proton PDFs were evaluated using the error sets of the CT10 [10], MSTW 2008 68% CL [8] and NNPDF 2.3 [12] NLO PDF sets, by reweighting the MC@NLO + Herwig tt sample based on the x and Q 2 values of the partons participating in the hard scattering in each event.

Consistent results were obtained using both misidentified lepton estimation methods, and showed that the baseline Powheg + Pythia6 tt simulation sample overestimates the efficiencies of the lepton isolation requirements by up to 1% for electrons with p T in the range 40-80 GeV, and by up to 2% for muons at low p T , decreasing rapidly to less than 0.5% for 40 GeV.

The corresponding uncertainties are dominated by those on the misidentified lepton subtraction (including a comparison of the same-sign and |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 -based methods) and amount to typically 0.5-1% for electrons and 0.2-0.5% for muons.

The changes in each differential cross-section bin were calculated by scaling the differences seen in Powheg + Pythia6 samples generated at \u221a s = 8 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV. The resulting values were cross-checked with an explicit NLO fixed-order calculation using Sherpa 2.1 [73], making use of the Applgrid framework [93] to reweight an \u221a s = 8 TeV prediction so as to change the \u221a s value by \u00b10.66% which was then rescaled to correspond to a \u221a s change of 0.1%. The changes in the absolute cross-sections are in the range 0.2-0.4%, and largely cancel in the normalised cross-sections.",

The values of i b , i.e. the product of jet acceptance, reconstruction and b-tagging probabilities in each bin, were determined to be in the range 0.5-0.6, in agreement with the simulation prediction for each bin. The results were found to be stable when changing the minimum jet p T requirement from 25 GeV up to 55 GeV, and when using b-tagging working points corresponding to b-jet efficiencies of 60-80%. The electron and muon p T and |\u03b7| distributions were also measured separately, instead of combining them into lepton distributions with two entries per event, and found to be compatible. The bin-by-bin comparison of the electron and muon p T (|\u03b7|) distributions has a \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of 10.9/9 (12.5/8), in both cases taking into account statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties.",

Each table shows the measured crosssection values and uncertainties, together with a breakdown of the total uncertainties into components due to data statistics ('Stat.'), tt modelling uncertainties ('tt mod.'), leptonrelated uncertainties ('Lept'), jet and b-tagging uncertainties ('Jet/b'), background uncertainties ('Bkg.') and luminosity/beam energy uncertainties ('L/E b '), corresponding to the breakdown in Sects. 5.1-5.5.

Other systematic uncertainties due to tt modelling, leptons and jets are significantly smaller than the statistical uncertainties, benefiting from cancellations between bins.

Bin-to-bin correlations in both the statistical (from the normalisation condition) and systematic uncertainties were taken into account via off-diagonal entries. The last bin of each distribution was excluded due to the normalisation condition, rendering the covariance matrix S (n\u22121) invertible. 7 The resulting \u03c7 2 values, number of degrees of freedom (n \u22121) and corresponding \u03c7 2 probability p-values are shown for each distribution and prediction in Table 8. As can be seen from Fig. 9, in the single-lepton p T distribution, the data are softer than the predictions from Powheg with CT10 PDFs, interfaced to either Pythia6 or Pythia8. The Powheg-based predictions do not depend strongly on the choice of parton shower/hadronisation model or tune parameters controlling the amount of radiation. However, the agreement with data is improved when using HERAPDF 1.5 or reweighting to the NNLO top quark p T prediction from Ref. [25]. The predictions from the samples with alternative matrix-element event generators, i.e. MC@NLO + Herwig and Alpgen + Herwig, are also harder than the data, though  e + E \u03bc distributions (Fig. 12) show some similar features to p T , being softer than the predictions from the Powheg + Pythia6 samples with CT10, and better described with HERAPDF 1.5, and by aMC@NLO + Herwig++. The predictions for the single lepton |\u03b7 | and dilepton |y e\u03bc | distributions (Figs. 9, 10, 11) are insensitive to the choice of parton shower/hadronisation model and tune, and are also insensitive to the top quark p T reweighting. The data distributions are more central than the predictions of all the NLO event generators (Powheg, MC@NLO and aMC@NLO) with CT10 PDFs, but are better described by Powheg with HERAPDF 1.5, and to a lesser extent also by Alpgen + Herwig, which uses the leading-order CTEQ6L1 PDF. These distributions, whose experimental measurements are limited by statistical uncertainties over the full kinematic range, are thus particularly suitable for constraining PDFs, as explored further in Sect. 7.",

            "text": "The results for the combinations of distributions reflect the observations for the individual distributions.    MCFM provides an NLO fixed-order prediction of the tt process in the dilepton channel, including NLO QCD corrections in both production and decay in the on-shell approximation, and full NLO spin correlations [106]. Only the direct decays of W \u2192 e/\u03bc are included, so these predictions were compared to the measurements corrected to remove the leptonic \u03c4 decay contributions. The top quark mass m t was set to 172.5 GeV. Informed by the discussion in Ref. [107], the central values for the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to m t /2, the lower than typical (m t ) scale choice being intended to account for the impact of resummed soft-gluon contributions not included in the fixedorder calculations. The MCFM predictions do not include quantum electrodynamics (QED) final state photon radiation, unlike the experimental measurements where the lep- tons are dressed with nearby photons as discussed in Sect. 4. Therefore, the MCFM predictions were corrected bin-bybin using corrections derived from two tt samples generated with Pythia8 (version 8.205) [108] and the ATTBAR tune [109] with QED final-state radiation enabled and disabled. These corrections are typically 1-2% on the absolute and always smaller than 1% on the normalised differential crosssections. No corrections were applied to the normalised |\u03b7 | and |y e\u03bc | distributions, as the determined corrections were always smaller than 0.3% and consistent with unity within the simulation statistical uncertainties. The ratios of the MCFM normalised differential crosssection predictions with HERAPDF 1.5 (the PDF set found to best fit the data when comparing with Powheg + Pythia6 samples in Sect. 6.2) to data are shown in Fig. 13. The uncertainties in the predictions include effects from PDFs, QCD scales and the value of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S . For each individual component variation, the prediction was renormalised to unity before calculating the shift for each bin; the effects on the normalised cross-section predictions are typically significantly smaller than those on the absolute cross-sections. The PDF uncertainties for CT14 and MMHT were evaluated from the sum in quadrature of the symmetrised up/down variations from each individual eigenvector pair from the PDF error set. For the HERAPDF sets, each pair of eigenvector or model parameter variations was treated as an independent variation. For NNPDF 3.0, the 100 replica sets which represent the NNPDF uncertainty were used to define a full covariance matrix taking into account correlations between the bins of each distribution. The QCD scale uncertainties were evaluated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales \u03bc R and \u03bc F separately, and adding the variations in quadrature. Each scale was varied by factors of one-half and two from its central value (m t /2), and the resulting variations symmetrised. This procedure was used instead of taking an envelope including simultaneous variations of \u03bc F and \u03bc R in order to properly account for the correlations between bins of the normalised differential cross-section predictions. Finally, the \u03b1 S uncertainty was evaluated using the HERAPDF 1.5 PDF sets with \u03b1 S set to 0.116 and 0.120, rescaling the resulting uncertainty to  \u03b1 S = \u00b10.0015, in line with the corresponding PDF4LHC recommendation [110].",

As shown in Fig. 13, these distributions are the most sensitive to PDF variations, whilst being less sensitive to QCD scale variations and the value of m t .

Provided that other theoretical uncertainties in the predictions (as discussed in Sect. 6) can be kept under control, fitting these distributions offers a complementary way to measure m t compared to more traditional determinations from complete reconstruction of the top quark decay products [33][34][35][36]. Ref. [32] explores such an approach in detail, arguing that measurements from normalised lepton distributions are less sensitive to the modelling of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD, and are closer to the ideal of a measurement of the top quark pole mass m pole t than those employing a direct measurement of the top quark decay products. It also stresses the importance of using several different The orange bands show the result of profiling these PDFs to the tt normalised differential cross-section data leptonic observables to probe for inadequacies in the theoretical descriptions of the distributions which may introduce biases in the extracted m t values. Experimentally, the doubletagging technique employed here results in measurements with little uncertainty from the hadronic components of the tt system, again reducing the exposure to QCD modelling compared to the measurements based on reconstructing the top quark decay products. Several sets of top mass determinations are reported here, based either on predictions from the NLO matrix element event generator Powheg interfaced to Pythia6 and the CT10 PDFs as described in Sect. 2, or on fixed-order predictions with NLO descriptions of the tt production and top quark decay from the MCFM program with various PDF sets, as described in Sect. 6.3. In the first case, m t is extracted either by using a template fit parameterising the predictions as a function of m t and finding the value which minimises the \u03c7 2 with respect to the measured data (described in Sect. 8.1), or by calculating moments of the distributions in data and comparing them to the corresponding moments of the predicted distributions for different values of m t (Sect. 8.2). In the template fit method, the comparisons between data and predictions are performed at particle level, in contrast to the template fits used for the ATLAS m t measurements based on reconstruction of the top quark decay products [120], where the comparisons are performed at detector level using the reconstructed distributions and fully-simulated Monte Carlo events. The template fit method uses the complete information from the measured distribution, taking into account the uncertainty in each bin, whereas the moments method, advocated in Ref. [32], allows different features of the distribution shapes to be emphasised via the comparisons of moments of different order. The results from these two methods are discussed and compared in Sect. 8.3.",

This approach is similar to the template fit discussed above; the use of moments was not pursued as it does not exploit the full information of each distribution and does not allow the reduction of uncertainties via constrained nuisance parameters. The m t value used in the fixedorder predictions corresponds to a well-defined renormalisation scheme, which is the pole mass (m pole t ) scheme within the MCFM implementation. Both the QCD scale uncertainties, representing the effects of missing higher-order corrections beyond NLO, and the PDF uncertainties, are included in the \u03c7 2 formalism in a natural way. This formalism also allows m t to be determined using several distributions simultaneously, giving the most precise results from any of the techniques explored here.

Uncertainties in the predictions due to the choice of PDFs, tt generator and radiation settings were assessed in the same way, i.e. from the shifts in  Table 14 and Fig. 17. The table shows the \u03c7 2 at the best fit mass for each distribution, and the breakdown of uncertainties into statistical, experimental systematic and theoretical contributions, evaluated as discussed in Sect. 8.1. For the template fits, the data statistical uncertainty was evaluated from a \u03c7 2 minimisation of Eq. (10) with only statistical uncertainties included in the covariance matrix S. The experimental systematic uncertainty was evaluated as the quadrature difference between the total uncertainty (when including both statistical and experimental systematic uncertainties in S), and the data statistical uncertainty. For the moments method, the statistical and experimental systematic uncertainties were evaluated directly on the moments (k) as discussed in Sect. 8.2. The ratios of predictions to data at the best-fit top quark mass found by the application of the template fit method to each distribution are shown in Fig. 18. The data are generally well-described by these predictions, as can also be seen from the \u03c7 2 values in The central values of the template fit results from the five distributions exhibit a spread (envelope) of about 6 GeV. The results from the fits of p T and p e T + p \u03bc T lie 4-5 GeV below that from p e\u03bc T , which is close to the world-average mass value from reconstruction of top quark decay products of 173.34 \u00b1 0.76 GeV [121]. The consistency of the fit results was assessed by combining them using the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) technique [122]. Correlations in the statistical uncertainties were assessed using pseudoexperiments as described in Sect. 4.3. Correlations between systematic uncertainties were determined by assuming the effects on m t from each individual experimental or theoretical component to be fully correlated between distributions.

The \u03c7 2 for the consistency of each prediction with the data was calculated using Eq. 9, incorporating both PDF and QCD scale uncertainties into the theoretical uncertainties represented by the nuisance parameters b th . The central scales were again chosen to be \u03bc F = \u03bc R = m t /2, with the values varying with m t in the mass scan, and independent variations of \u03bc F and \u03bc R by factors of two and one-half defining the one standard deviation up and down scale variations. The \u03c7 2 was evaluated at each mass point, and interpolated using a fourth-order polynomial. The asymmetric uncertainty in the fitted value of m t was defined as the points at which the \u03c7 2 increases by one unit either side of the minimum point. This uncertainty naturally includes both experimental statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurements, and theoretical uncertainties due to PDFs and QCD scale choices. In this method, the top quark mass can be extracted from each measured distribution individually, or from the combination of several distributions, where the sum i in Eq. (9) runs over the bins of all considered distributions, and the experimental covariance matrix includes both statistical and systematic correlations between bins of the same and different distributions, evaluated as discussed in Sect. 6.2. When fitting several distributions simultaneously, the system is over-constrained, profiling the various sources of theoretical uncertainty. For example, when including all eight measured distributions, the |\u03b7 | and |y e\u03bc | distributions have little sensitivity to m t , but constrain the PDF parameters. The \u03c6 e\u03bc distribution constrains the QCD scale parameters \u03bc F and \u03bc R , under the assumption that uncertainties in higher-order QCD corrections are parameterised by \u03bc F and \u03bc R in a way that can be transported from one distribution to another. Two alternative dynamical scale choices were also tested in order to probe this assumption, as discussed in Sect. 8.5 below.",

As shown in Sect. 7, the constraint on the gluon PDF from the leptonic tt measurements is consistent with the PDF determination from DIS data. The use of the NNPDF 3.0_nojet PDF set, which does not include Tevatron and LHC jet production data, allows the effects on m t of any possible tension between DIS and jet data in the determination of the gluon PDF to be tested. The results from combined fits to all eight distributions, using predictions from all six PDF sets, are shown in Table 16 and Fig. 19. In Tables 15 and 16, the decomposition of the total uncertainty from each mass fit into statistical, experimental and theoretical (PDF and QCD scales) uncertainties was obtained in analogy to the numerical procedure outlined in Ref. [124]. For each individual source of statistical or systematic uncertainty (corresponding to a nuisance parameter b j,exp or b k,th in Eq. (9)), the data were shifted by plus or minus one standard deviation, and a new m t value obtained by re-minimising the \u03c7 2 function. The resulting shifts in m t were added in quadrature to obtain the decomposition into the various categories. The quadrature sum of the decomposed uncertainties agrees with the total to within 10% in all cases, the residual differences being due to nonlinearity between the uncertainty sources and the extracted values of m t .

However, the m t values resulting from the NNPDF 3.0 and NNPDF 3.0_nojet PDFs are close, indicating that the results are not sensitive to whether the jet data are included or not. Amongst the 'global fit' PDF sets incorporating a larger set of experimental data, the smallest \u03c7 2 values result from the fit with NNPDF 3.0, though the values from the other PDFs are also reasonable. The results using NNPDF 3.0 were therefore used to define the central m t value from the combined fit to all eight distributions, and an additional uncertainty of 0.3 GeV, corresponding to half the difference of the envelope encompassing all the other PDFs, was added in quadrature to the PDF uncertainty from NNPDF 3.0 alone. The effect of the uncertainty in the value of \u03b1 S was found to be 0.01 GeV. The residual dependence of the measured differential crosssections on the top quark mass assumed in the simulation (see Sect. 5.1) is very small. A \u00b15 GeV variation around the baseline value of m t = 172.5 GeV was assumed, giving a 0.1 GeV change on the result of the combined fit. The choice of a fixed central scale, \u03bc F = \u03bc R = m t /2 is expected to provide a good description of the inclusive tt cross-section and differential distributions in the kinematic regions dominated by top quarks with relatively low p T . However, dynamical scales, which vary as a function of the top quark kinematics, are expected to be more appropriate for modelling the regions with high p T [107]. Two alternative dynamical central scale choices for the tt production process were explored to test the sensitivity of the results to this choice: The results from the combined fit to all eight distributions with these scale choices and all six PDF sets are shown in the lower part of Table 16, and displayed graphically in Fig. 21. In the same way as for the fixed central scale, the actual factorisation and normalisation scales used in the predictions were allowed to vary independently around the dynamical central scales, with one standard deviation variations corresponding to factors of two and one-half. The \u03c7 2 values for the fits with a central scale of H T /4 are all improved compared to those for m t /2, reflecting a generally better description of the highp T tails of the distributions. The \u03c7 2 values from the E T /2 fits lie between the other two choices. The largest difference in the m t values from a dynamical scale and the fixed scale with any PDF (1.1 GeV for E T /2 vs. m t /2 with the CT14 PDF) was used to define an additional theoretical uncertainty due to the choice of the functional form of the QCD scales.

The theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the comparison of results with different QCD central scale choices. Figure 22 shows a comparison with previous determinations of the top quark pole mass from the inclusive tt production cross-section [13,15,40] and from the invariant mass distribution of the tt plus one jet system [41]. The present result is in agreement with these other results, all of which have larger uncertainties. It is also in agreement with the Tevatron and LHC average measurement of 173.34 \u00b1 0.76 GeV from reconstruction of the top quark decay products [121], as well as with more precise recent results using similar techniques [35,36,129]. However, the precision of the present pole mass result is not sufficient to probe potential differences between it and the other techniques at the 1 GeV level.   The theoretical uncertainty of 1.2 GeV on the final result using fixed-order predictions is significantly smaller than the uncertainties due to tt modelling and potential NNLO effects in the top quark p T spectrum for the fits based on Powheg + Pythia6 templates. In the fixed-order approach, the potential missing NNLO corrections are absorbed into the variations of the QCD scales \u03bc F and \u03bc R , which are significantly constrained by the fit to the complete set of distributions, including those with little sensitivity to m t . However, there remains a significant uncertainty of about 1 GeV due to the choice of the functional form of the QCD scales, limiting the gain from the combined fit. This approach would therefore benefit significantly from the availability of fixed-order calculations including NNLO effects in the top quark production and decay [130], which should reduce the uncertainties due to scale choices. Off-shell and interference effects in the pp \u2192 W W bb \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bdbb + X process (including both tt and single top W t contributions) [131][132][133][134][135][136][137], as well as NLO electroweak corrections [138,139], were not considered in this analysis. They are expected to be small compared to the theoretical uncertainties of the current result, but likely cannot be neglected in a determination of m t based on NNLO QCD predictions. These theoretical advances would allow the power of the full set of distributions to be utilised more effectively, especially in view of the likely reduction in the experimental statistical and systematic uncertainties from the larger tt samples now becoming available from LHC running at \u221a s = 13 TeV.",

The jet uncertainties also have a very small effect on G i e\u03bc , through the requirement that leptons be separated from selected jets by R > 0.4. Jet-related uncertainties: The jet energy scale was varied according to the uncertainties derived from simulation and in situ calibration measurements [81], using a model with 22 orthogonal uncertainty components describing the evolution with jet p T and |\u03b7|. The effects of residual uncertainties in the modelling of the jet energy resolution [88] were assessed by smearing jet energies in simulation. The jet reconstruction efficiency was measured in data using track-based jets, and the effect of residual uncertainties assessed in simulation by randomly discarding jets. The modelling of the pileup rejection requirement applied to jets was studied using Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc+jets events [82]. b-tagging uncertainties: The efficiencies for b-tagging jets in tt signal events were extracted from the data, but simulation was used to predict the numbers of b-tagged jets in the W t single top and diboson backgrounds. The corresponding uncertainties were assessed using studies of b-jets containing muons, charm jets containing D * + mesons and inclusive jet events [83].",

The uncertainties due to the limited size of the W t simulation samples are negligible in comparison to the modelling uncertainties. Diboson modelling: The uncertainties in modelling the diboson background events (mainly W W ) with one and two additional b-tagged jets were assessed by compar-ing the predictions from Alpgen + Herwig with those of Sherpa 1.4.3 [73] including the effects of massive b and c quarks. The resulting uncertainties in the diboson background are typically in the range 20-30%, substantially larger than the differences between recent predictions for the inclusive diboson cross-sections at NNLO in QCD [89] and the NLO predictions from MCFM used to normalise the simulated samples. The background from SM Higgs production with H \u2192 W W and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 is smaller than the uncertainties assigned for diboson modelling, and was neglected. Z+jets extrapolation: The backgrounds from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc accompanied by one or two b-tagged jets were extrapolated from the analogous Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc event rates, with uncertainties of 20% for one and 30% for two additional b-tagged jets, as discussed in Sect. 4.2.",
