            "text": "The hadronic cross section is a fundamental quantity, its energy dependence can, however, so far not be derived by first principles from the QCD-Lagrangian. Within Regge phenomenology, the strong interaction is due to the exchange of Reggeons which are characterised by their trajectory. At high energies, hadronic interactions are dominated by the exchange of an additional trajectory, the Pomeron. The energy dependence of the total hadronic cross section reflects therefore the interplay between Reggeon and Pomeron contributions. A three component fit yields good agreement with the existing data both for proton-proton and proton-antiproton cross sections in the range from \u221a s = 23 GeV to \u221a s = 8 TeV. Here, the three components are defined by the f 2 , a 2 , the \u03c1, \u03c9 and the Pomeron-trajectory [1]. Hadronic charge exchange reactions can only be due to the exchange of charged Reggeons, and are therefore of interest for testing the Regge prediction of their energy behaviour. The transfer of electric charge from one beam particle to a particle of the opposite beam is associated with bremsstrahlung radiation [2]. The theorem of Low relates the radiative leading and next-to-leading order in photon energy of the bremsstrahlung amplitude to the corresponding non-radiative amplitude [3]. The theorem of Low refers to soft photons, i.e. to photon energies which are smaller than any other momentum scale in the process. A study of photon emission in the high energy limit finds corrections in the next-to-leading radiative amplitude due to the internal structure of the external states [4]. The production of non-abelian gauge bosons and gravitons is studied as a generalization of the theorem of Low in Ref. [5].",

The missing of two forward charged tracks would, however, introduce considerable uncertainty.
