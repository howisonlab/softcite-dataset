Jets are identified using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter values of 0.4 and 0.6. The double-differential cross-sections are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum and the jet rapidity, covering jet transverse momenta from 100 GeV to 2 TeV. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects and electroweak effects, as well as Monte Carlo simulations with next-to-leading-order matrix elements interfaced to parton showering, are compared to the measured cross-sections. A quantitative comparison of the measured cross-sections to the QCD calculations using several sets of parton distribution functions is performed.",

In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), jet production can be interpreted as the fragmentation of quarks and gluons produced in the scattering process and its measurement provides information about the colour-exchange interaction. Therefore, the measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section at the LHC provides a test of the validity of perturbative QCD (pQCD) and the results can contribute to the determination",

The measurement is performed using jets with p T \u2265 100 GeV and |y| < 3. The integrated luminosity of the data used in this paper is more than 100 times larger than that of the previous ATLAS measurement [5], allowing larger kinematic reach, with the jet p T measured up to 2 TeV, corresponding to x T = 2p T / \u221a s 0.6. A precise measurement with full details of uncertainties and their correlations is performed taking advantage of the increased statistical power and improved jet calibration [9]. A set of NLO pQCD calculations, to which corrections for both nonperturbative QCD effects and electroweak effects are applied, is compared to the results. The comparison is quantitatively evaluated.",

Uncertainties in the PDF sets are propagated through the calculations following the prescription given for each PDF set and the PDF4LHC recommendations [36]. The evaluated uncertainties on the predictions are scaled to the 68% confidence level for all PDF sets. Calculations are redone with varied renormalisation and factorisation scales to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher-order terms in the pQCD expansion. The nominal scales are multiplied by factors of (f \u00b5 R , f \u00b5 F ) = (0.5, 0.5), (1, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2).

The uncertainty reflecting the \u03b1 S precision is evaluated following the recommended prescription of the CTEQ group [37], by calculating the cross-sections using a series of PDFs which are derived with various fixed \u03b1 S values. Figure 1 shows the relative uncertainties in the NLO pQCD calculations evaluated using the CT10 PDF set for the inclusive jet cross-section as a function of the jet p T , in representative rapidity bins for jets with R = 0.6.

Based on a quantitative evaluation, most of the NLO pQCD predictions are in good agreement with the measurement, confirming that perturbative QCD can describe jet production up to a jet transverse momentum of 2 TeV. The measurement is also well described by the predictions from an NLO matrix element MC generator with matched parton showers and with electroweak correction applied.  Figure 11.

The in-situ category shows the uncertainties from the components of the JES uncertainty given by in-situ calibration techniques. These techniques are based on the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a well-calibrated reference object, such as the balance between a central jet and a forward jet in a dijet system, the balance between a jet and a Z boson or a photon, and the balance between a recoil system of jets and a photon or a high-p T jet. For jets with p T 1 TeV, where the techniques employing p T balance are limited by sample size, the uncertainty is estimated from a study of the calorimeter response to single hadrons.  Figure 13. Ratio of predictions from Powheg to the measured double-differential inclusive jet cross-section, shown as a function of the jet p T in bins of jet rapidity, for anti-k t jets with R = 0.6. The figure also shows the NLO pQCD prediction using NLOJET++ with the CT10 NLO PDF set, corrected for non-perturbative effects and electroweak effects. The Powheg predictions use Pythia for the simulation of parton showers, hadronisation, and the underlying event with the AUET2B tune and the Perugia 2011 tune. Electroweak corrections are applied to the predictions.
