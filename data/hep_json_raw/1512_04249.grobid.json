The partial-wave analysis (PWA) of these high-precision data reveals previously unseen details but is limited in parts by systematic effects. The PWA is based on the isobar model, in which multi-particle decays are described as a chain of subsequent two-body decays. Here, fixed mass distributions for the appearing intermediate resonances, the so-called isobars, are assumed. These shapes, which e.g. may be parametrized by Breit-Wigner amplitudes, represent prior knowledge that has to be put into the analysis model and may therefore introduce a model dependence, thus increasing systematic uncertainties. We present a novel method, which allows to extract isobar amplitudes directly from the data in a more modelindependent way. As a first application, diffractively produced \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events are analyzed. Here, the focus lies in particular on the scalar \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 subsystem, where in a previous analysis a signal for a new axial-vector state a 1 (1420) was found in the f 0 (980)\u03c0 decay mode.",

A first analysis of this kind was performed, freeing the isobar parametrizations of three waves with J PC = 0 ++ isobars. Most of the expected features are reproduced, especially the decay of the new a 1 (1420) \u2192 f 0 (980) \u03c0 \u2212 . This confirms the new resonance observed in the conventional analysis. In addition to resonances, broad structures are observed, which typically change their shape with t and may originate from non-resonant processes or cross talk with waves    that still employ fixed isobar amplitudes. The latter effect is currently being studied by extending the new approach to more waves. The current goal is a total of eleven freed waves, which then would describe a large fraction of the observed intensity. Unfortunately ambiguities in the form of linear dependent modes appear when freeing more than one wave with the same 3\u03c0 quantum numbers. How to remove these modes is subject to current studies.   ",
