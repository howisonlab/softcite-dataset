            "text": "The decay B + \u2192 D + s K + K \u2212 is mediated by a b \u2192 u transition shown in figure 1 and is therefore suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) due to the small size of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V ub . The branching fraction for this decay is currently not measured, however a similar decay, B + \u2192 D + s \u03c0 0 , has been observed with a branching fraction of B(B + \u2192 D + s \u03c0 0 ) = (1.5 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [1]. In the SM, the decay B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6 proceeds dominantly via the annihilation diagram shown in figure 1. This suppressed topology requires the wave functions of the incoming quarks to overlap sufficiently to annihilate into a virtual W + boson. The decay is further suppressed by the small magnitude of the CKM matrix element V ub associated with the annihilation vertex. In addition, unlike many rare hadronic decays including B + \u2192 D + s K + K \u2212 , possible contributions from rescattering effects are expected to be small, for example contributions from intermediate states such as B + \u2192 D + s \u03c9 [2]. Several SM predictions have been made for the branching fraction of the B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6 decay [3][4][5][6], using input from lattice calculations [7][8][9]. These predictions are in the range (1 \u2212 7) \u00d7 10 \u22127 , where the limit on the precision is dominated by hadronic uncertainties. However, additional diagrams contributing to this decay can arise in some extensions of the SM, such as supersymmetric models with R-parity violation. They could enhance the branching fraction and/or produce large CP asymmetries [4,5], which makes the B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6 decay a promising place to search for new physics beyond the SM. 1 The LHCb experiment reported evidence for the decay B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6 using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb \u22121 taken during 2011, at a centreof-mass energy of 7 TeV [10]. A total of 6.7 +4.5 \u22122.6 candidates was observed. The branching fraction was determined to be B(B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6) = (1.87 +1.25 \u22120.73 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , (1.1)",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector JHEP01(2018)131 located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp interaction vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

At least one of these charged particles must have a transverse momentum p T > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. The second algorithm selects \u03c6 candidates decaying to two charged kaons. Each kaon must have a transverse momentum p T > 0.8 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. The invariant mass of the kaon pair must be within 20 MeV/c 2 of the known \u03c6 mass [11].

Simulated events are used to determine the relative efficiencies of the signal and normalisation channels. The samples are generated for each of the running periods. In these simulations, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [15,16] with a specific LHCb configuration [17].

An ensemble of pseudoexperiments is generated for different values of the branching fraction B(B + \u2192 D + s \u03c6). These generated pseudoexperiments are then fitted with the nominal fit model to calculate the fitted branching fraction and associated statistical uncertainty, \u03c3 stat .
