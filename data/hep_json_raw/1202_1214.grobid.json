The invariant mass of the pair must be compatible with the known J/\u03c8 mass. K 0 S candidates are reconstructed through their decay into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with take pairs of oppositely charged tracks. An additional requirement of L/\u03c3 L > 5 is made on the K 0 S candidate, where L is the distance between the K 0 S decay vertex and the B decay vertex and \u03c3 L is the uncertainty of L. We constrain the invariant masses of the reconstructed J/\u03c8 and K 0 S candidates to their known masses. The initial B flavour is determined by the combination of various tagging algorithms. These either determine the flavour of the non-signal b hadron produced in the event (opposite side, OS), or they search for an additional pion accompanying the signal B 0 or B 0 (same side, SS\u03c0). There are four tagging algorithms that use the charge of the lepton (\u00b5, e) from semileptonic B decays, or that of the kaon from the b \u2192 c \u2192 s decay chain, or the charge of the inclusive secondary vertex reconstructed from b decay products. All of these algorithms have an intrinsic mistag rate, due to picking up tracks from the underlying event, or due to flavour oscillations of neutral tag B mesons. For each signal B 0 candidate the tagging algorithms also predict the mistag probability \u03c9. For this various kinematic variables such as momenta and angles of the tagging particles are combined into neural networks. The neural networks are trained on MC simulated events.",
