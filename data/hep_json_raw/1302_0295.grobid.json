The results are based on proton-proton collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities between 1 fb \u22121 and 5 fb \u22121 collected at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model. The non-observation of a signal is converted to limits at the 95% confidence level on the production cross section times branching ratio and on the masses of the hypothesized new particles for appropriate benchmark models.",

However, no new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) has been observed yet, and it is critical to explore a wide range of possible signatures. A promising avenue lies in final states that involve the heaviest of the particles presumed to be elementary, the top quark. This document summarizes the status of these searches using the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] detectors at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results are based on proton-proton collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities between 1 fb \u22121 and 5 fb \u22121 collected at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011.",

The so-called hierarchy problem refers to the fact that the large quantum contributions to the square of the Higgs-boson mass should make the Higgs mass many orders of magnitude larger than the electroweak scale. Either there is an incredible, unnatural fine-tuning cancellation or nature chose another mechanism to protect the Higgs mass to keep it at the observed low value [3,4]. Many models introduce top partners to cancel these quantum corrections. Finally, there are tantalizing hints of new physics in the forward-backward asymmetry in tt events at the Tevatron [5,6].",
