            "text": "The current knowledge on the B + \u2192 ppK + decay is based on the measurements performed at the B-factories [1,2]. Thanks to the high statistics available in the next years at LHCb, due to the large bb production cross section, \u03c3 bb = (284 \u00b1 20 \u00b1 49)\u00b5 b [3] at a centre of mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV, more precise measurements can be performed and possibly new physics can be revealed. LHCb is a singla arm forward spectrometer optimised to perform precise CP violation measurements and rare decays study in the heavy flavour sector. Three-body baryonic B decays are expected to proceed predominantly via b \u2192 s penguin diagrams or doubly Cabibbo suppressed tree diagrams [4] and as such new heavy virtual particles can give measurable departures from Standard Model expectations. The baryon-antibaryon pair can also be produced by a pair of gluons in OZI suppressed penguin diagrams, where gluonic resonances could be formed. The three Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. The interference between the penguin diagram Moreover, three-body baryonic decays offer a clean environment to study intermediate states, as charmonium states, excited \u039b baryons and exotic states (glueballs [5], baryonium, pentaquarks). In fact, the pp final state can be produced through a resonant intermediate state, a cc state or through an unknown exotic state. At LHCb, beyond the study of well known charmonium states, it can be interesting to observe charmonium-like states such as X(3872) or new intermediate states in order to study their nature and properties. Another interesting feature observed both at the BaBar and Belle detectors in three body baryonic B decays is the low mass m pp enhancement. Several explanations have been proposed. A study of the distribution of events in the Dalitz plot can explain the origin of this mass enhancement. [6]. A preliminary study of this mode based on the sample of events collected by the LHCb detector in the 2010 data taking period is presented.

The selection strategy is based on a preselection with very loose selection criteria. A multivariate analysis using the \"Boosted Decision Tree\" algorithm of the  TMVA package [8] is used to optimise the selection efficiency. The variables used in the selection procedure exploit kinematic and topological characteristics of b-hadron decays. Three charged particles in the final state with large transverse momenta are required. The three final state particles have to come from the same displaced secondary vertex requiring a good vertex fit and a significant distance between the two vertices. Moreover it is required a small maximum distance of closest approach between the tracks and non zero impact parameters. And the momenta direction of the three daughters has to be compatible with the flight direction of the B. Furthermore the particle identification information, provided by two RICH detectors in LHCb, is a fundamental ingredient of the selection in order to identify correctly protons and kaons candidates. A signal efficiency of more than 70% with respect to preselected events has been obtained using the BDT algorithm with a signal to background ratio of S /B \u223c 1.",
