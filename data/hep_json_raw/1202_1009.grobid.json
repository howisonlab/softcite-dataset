It would be a straight forward extension of the standard model to add an additional generation by adding two fermions each to the quark and lepton sectors. These quark and lepton fields would each consist of a left-handed weak doublet and two right-handed singlets. They would add new masses and mixing parameters to the model. Electroweak measurements constrain these parameters. The mass of the neutrino would have to be larger than half the Z boson mass [3] and the mass splitting between the two quarks would have to be less than the W mass [4]. The latter constraint means that the decay of the heavier quark of the 4th generation to its lighter partner is kinematically surpressed and both 4th generation quarks must decay to 3rd generation quarks, assuming moderate mixing exists between the 4th and 3rd generations. The decay modes would then be t \u2192 bW and b \u2192 tW \u2192 bWW.",

            "text": "Both CDF and D0 have searched for t quarks that are pair-produced in pp collisions and decay to bW [5]. The most promising decay channel is the lepton+jets channel in which one W boson decays to leptons (e\u03bd or \u00b5\u03bd) and the other W boson decays to jets. The final state thus is the same as for the decay of a tt quark pair. Both experiments select events with a high-p T electron or muon, missing p T , and at least four jets. The dominant background for this a e-mail: ulrich heintz@brown.edu signature is tt production with a smaller contribution from W+jets production and other electroweak processes. As requiring b-tagged jets in the final state does not reduce the tt background significantly, D0 does not require any b-tags in the final state to make the search sensitive to any pairproduced objects that decay to W+jet. CDF performs two analyses, one without requiring a b-tagged jet and one requiring at least one b-tagged jet. The t t signal can be distinguished from tt production best through the large mass of the top quark. Thus both experiments perform a kinematic fit to the t t \u2192 b \u03bdbqq hypothesis and use the twodimensional distribution of the best value for the mass of the t quark from the kinematic fit, m f it , and the scalar sum of the momenta of all reconstructed objects, H T , to search for a signal (Figure 1). Figures 2 and 3 show the limits obtained on the t t production cross section versus t mass. Thus t quarks that decay exclusively to a W boson and a jet are disfavored for masses below about 360 GeV.

The analysis is designed to search for events in which both Z bosons decay to electrons or muons. The branching fraction for this decay is small -about 0.5% but there is essentially no background expected for this four-lepton event signature. In an integrated luminosity of 6 fb \u22121 , CDF observed eight events, which is roughly twice the number of events expected from the continuum ZZ production predicted by the standard model. Four of these events cluster wihtin 7 GeV of a ZZ pair mass of 327 GeV (Figure ??). The p-value for observing an excess of this size is about 1\u22122\u00d710 \u221214 . If this excess indeed originates from anomalous ZZ production similar excesses should appear in other ZZ decay channels which have larger barnching fractions but higher backgrounds. CDF have examined the channels ZZ \u2192 + \u2212 \u03bd\u03bd and ZZ \u2192 + \u2212 qq. None of them show any excess over standard model expectations. D0 also have performed a measurement of the ZZ cross section in the four-lepton channel [13] but do not see any excess in their data. and are incompatible with an excess of the size implied by the four-lepton events implying that the excess observed in the four lepton channel is a statistical fluctuation and not an indicator of an enhanced ZZ cross section. Based on the four-lepton data, CDF set the limits shown in Figure 11 for the production cross section of a narrow ZZ resonance.  ",

If there are more than four dimensions the observed Planck scale would only be an effective four-dimensional scale and the true scale of gravity could be much lower, near the electroweak scale. Extra spacetime dimensions in which all fields can propagate are called universal extra dimensions. One would then expect the existence of Kaluza Klein excitations for all particles with a mass spectrum M 2 n = M 2 0 + n 2 /R 2 , where M n is the mass of the n th Kaluza Klein excitation, n = 0 correponds to the standard model particle that has no momentum in the extra dimension, and 1/R is the compactification scale of the extra dimension. Current experimental limits still allow for this scale to be on order of the weak scale. This scale determines the mass spectra of the Kaluza Klein modes [11]. The number of Kaluza Klein modes is conserved so that there cannot be any vertices with an odd number of Kaluza Klein modes. The lightest mode that propagates in the extra dimension corresponds the n = 1 and could be accessible at the LHC. The Kaluza Klein excitations of the gluon, g 1 , and the quarks, q 1 , would be produced in pairs through the strong interaction at the LHC and they would decay to the lightest Kaluza Klein particle, the Kaluza Klein excitation of the photon \u03b3 1 , through a cascade decay. In this decay leptons of the same charge are produced with a branching fraction of about 1%.",

Multijet production is a significant background for this signature and it is estimated from data. The predicted spectra of kinematic quantities agree well with observation and a boosted decision tree [15] was trained using many input variables to provide a discriminant for the Kaluza Klein signal and background. The distribution of this disciminant (Figure 12) is used to obtain the limits shown in Figure 13. The results disfavor compactification scales 1/R < 260 GeV and indicate that the mass of the lightest Kaluza Klein quark must be above 317 GeV. Fig. 12.

Thus these events will result in the same final states as tt production except for larger missing p T from the escaping dark matter particles. CDF considered the lepton+jets channel with an electron or muon, at least four jets and missing p T in excess of 100-160 GeV, and the all hadronic channel with 5-10 jets, large H T , and missing p T > 50 GeV [17]. No evidence for dark matter production has been observed and CDF was able to set limits on production cross sections.
