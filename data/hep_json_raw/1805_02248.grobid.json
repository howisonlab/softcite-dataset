The nuclear modification factor R pPb is measured for prompt \u03c8(2S) in the transverse momentum range 4 < p T < 30 GeV/c and the center-of-mass rapidity range \u22122.4 < y CM < 1.93. The results on \u03c8(2S) R pPb are compared to the corresponding modification factor for prompt J/\u03c8 mesons. The results point to different nuclear effects at play in the production of the excited charmonium state compared to the ground state, in the region of backward rapidity and for p T < 10 GeV/c.",

            "text": "A similar level of suppression was later observed in gold-gold collisions at the BNL RHIC, at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [4,5]. At the CERN LHC, the production of charmonium (J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S)) and bottomonium (\u03d2(1S), \u03d2(2S), \u03d2(3S)) states has been studied in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV [6][7][8][9][10][11][12], bringing new elements for the understanding of the medium produced in highenergy heavy ion collisions. The quarkonium yields can be modified in heavy ion collisions because of several effects [13], including suppression [1] and recombination of charm quark pairs [14] inside the hot matter (QGP), and cold nuclear matter effects. An unambiguous interpretation of the nucleus-nucleus LHC results requires a quantitative understanding of cold nuclear matter effects. The nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) are known to be different from those in a E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. free proton [15,16]. In addition, gluon radiation induced by multiple parton scattering in the nucleus leads to transverse momentum (p T ) broadening and coherent energy loss, resulting in a significant quarkonium suppression in nuclear collisions at all available energies [17,18]. These phenomena are best studied in proton-nucleus collisions, in which hot medium effects, such as those due to the QGP, are likely to be limited.",

At the LHC, the ALICE [36] and CMS [11] Collaborations have reported a stronger suppression of the \u03c8(2S) state compared to the J/\u03c8 in PbPb collisions. In pPb collisions, ALICE [37], ATLAS [34], and LHCb [38] data show that \u03c8(2S) suppression, integrated over transverse momentum, is more pronounced than that of the J/\u03c8 . This observation suggests final-state effects for the excited states, possibly due to inelastic interactions with the medium produced in pPb collisions [39]. In the bottomonium sector, the double yield ratios \u03d2(3S)/\u03d2(1S) and \u03d2(2S)/\u03d2(1S) in pPb relative to pp collisions have been measured by CMS [40] and found to be less than unity, again indicating stronger final-state effects in the production of excited quarkonium states.",

Within the solenoid volume there are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The forward hadron (HF) calorimeter uses steel as absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located at \u00b111.2 m from the nominal interaction point. Together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2 and also serve as luminosity monitors. Muons are detected in gasionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid, in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for typical muons in this analysis of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps [43]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [44].",

While nPDFs [15,16] and coherent energy loss [17,18] are the most discussed effects to explain prompt J/\u03c8 meson suppression, these two phenomena are expected to affect the R pPb of prompt J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons by a similar amount.

The nuclear modification factor (R pPb ) of prompt \u03c8(2S), in the kinematic range 4 < p T < 30 GeV/c and \u22122.4 < y CM < 1.93, is determined and compared to that of prompt J/\u03c8 mesons, reported in Ref.[31]. The prompt \u03c8(2S) production is suppressed in the intermediate 6.5-10 GeV/c p T interval in the region of backward rapidity. The R pPb is consistent with unity everywhere else (although systematically smaller). The R pPb values of prompt J/\u03c8 when compared to those of prompt \u03c8(2S) mesons, point to different nuclear effects at play in the production of the excited charmonium state compared to the ground state, in the region of backward rapidity and for p T < 10 GeV/c. The effects of nuclear parton distribution functions or coherent energy loss are expected to affect the R pPb of prompt J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) by a similar amount, thus the results hint the presence of final-state interactions with the medium (partonic or hadronic) produced in pPb collisions.",
