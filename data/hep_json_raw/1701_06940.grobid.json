            "text": "Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in final states with at least three charged leptons, in any combination of electrons or muons. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015. Two jets are required in each event, providing good sensitivity to strong production of gluinos and squarks. The search regions, sensitive to a range of different new physics scenarios, are defined using the number of jets tagged as originating from bottom quarks, the sum of the magnitudes of the transverse momenta of the jets, the imbalance in the overall transverse momentum in the event, and the invariant mass of oppositesign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background contributions from standard model processes. These results are used to derive limits in terms of R-parity conserving simplified models of supersymmetry that describe strong production of gluinos and squarks. Model-independent limits are presented to facilitate the reinterpretation of the results in a broad range of scenarios for physics beyond the standard model.",

            "text": "Many types of beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) theories can produce multilepton events (three or more leptons) with a wide array of unique signatures [1][2][3][4][5], including a number of supersymmetric (SUSY) models [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. In these models, multilepton final states can arise from the decay of multiple vector bosons, e.g., in tt production with t \u2192 cH followed by H \u2192 WW * or H \u2192 ZZ * , or in strong production of pairs of squarks or gluinos, which often initiate complex decay chains that can result in multiple W and/or Z bosons. The standard model (SM) processes that produce this final state are also characterized by multiple bosons and are well-understood both theoretically [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] and experimentally [31][32][33][34][35]. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch This paper describes a search for new physics in final states with three or more leptons, electrons or muons, produced at the CERN LHC, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centerof-mass energy of 13 TeV, with the CMS detector. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 collected in 2015. The expected irreducible backgrounds come from diboson production (WZ and ZZ) or other SM processes, including ttW, ttZ, and ttH. These backgrounds are modeled using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations that have appropriate corrections applied to match the behavior of reconstructed objects in data. Reducible backgrounds are processes that produce one or more misidentified or nonprompt leptons, i.e. those that arise from jets or meson decays, that pass all reconstruction, identification, and isolation criteria. Estimates of the probabilities of observing misidentified or nonprompt leptons based on control samples in data are used.",

Forward calorimeters provide additional pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage for the HCAL. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of specialized hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from approximately 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [53].",

For electrons (muons), the tight selection requirements are I 1 = 0.12 (0.16), I 2 = 0.76 (0.69), and I 3 = 7.2 (6.0) GeV.

For this offline selection, the trigger efficiency is above 99%. Jets are reconstructed from particle-flow candidates [58] clustered using the anti-k T algorithm [56] with a distance parameter of 0.4 as implemented in the FastJet package [57]. Only jets with p T > 30 GeV and within the tracker acceptance |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered. Additional criteria are applied to reject events containing noise and mismeasured jets [59][60][61]. To avoid double counting, the closest matching jets to leptons are not considered if they are separated from the lepton by less than 0.4 in R. From those selected jets, the quantity H T is defined by H T = jets |p T |, for all jets that satisfy the above-mentioned criteria. Jet energies are corrected for a shift in the energy scale, contributions from additional, simultaneous pp collisions (pileup), and residual nonuniformity and nonlinearity differences between data and simulation [60].",

The analysis makes use of techniques based on control samples in data to estimate reducible backgrounds and to validate the simulation for use in estimating irreducible backgrounds. To maximize sensitivity to a broad range of possible signal models, we investigate 30 exclusive signal regions. The event yields observed in data are in agreement with the standard model background predictions. This search is designed to be sensitive to multiple BSM models. As an example, we interpret the result in the context of a gluino-pair production model that features cascade decays producing four top quarks in the final state. In this simplified model, we exclude gluinos with a mass of up to 1175 GeV in the case of a massless lightest supersymmteric particle (LSP). For gluino masses up to approximately 1150 GeV, neutralino masses below 650 GeV are excluded. These are the first CMS results reported in this final state at \u221a s = 13 TeV.",
