The HPQCD collaboration [19] computes short distance quantities like Wilson loops with lattice QCD and analyzes them with NNLO perturbative QCD. This yields a value for \u03b1 s . The lattice scale must then be related to a physical energy/momentum scale. This is achieved with the \u03a5 \u2032 -\u03a5 mass difference, however, many other quantities could be used as well [20]. HPQCD obtains \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1184 \u00b1 0.0006, where the uncertainty includes effects from truncating perturbation theory, finite lattice spacing and extrapolation of lattice data. An independent perturbative analysis of a subset of the same lattice-QCD data yields \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1192 \u00b1 0.0011 [21]. Using another, independent methodology, the currentcurrent correlator method, HPQCD obtains \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0007 [19]. A more recent result in [22], which avoids the staggered fermion treatment of [19], finds \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1205 \u00b1 0.0008 \u00b1 0.0005 +0.0000 \u22120.0017 [22], where the first uncertainty is statistical and the others are from systematics. Since this approach uses a different discretization of lattice fermions and a different general methodology, it provides an independent cross check of other lattice extractions of \u03b1 s . Finally, the JLQCD collaboration -in an analysis of Adler functions -obtains \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1181 \u00b1 0.0003 +0.0014 \u22120.0012 [23]. These results are summarized in Fig. 1(b). Since they are compatible with and largely independent from each other, a pre-average of lattice results is calculated using the same method as applied to determine the final world average value \u03b1 s , i.e. calculate a weighted average and a (correlated) error such that the overall \u03c7 2 equals unity per degree of freedom -rather than using the simple method as applied in the case of \u03c4 decays. This gives \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.1185 \u00b1 0.0007 which is taken as result from the sub-field of lattice determinations.",

For this review, we use the result obtained in [1] from data at the Z-pole, \u03b1 s (M 2 Z ) = 0.1197 \u00b1 0.0028, as it is based on a more constrained data set where QCD corrections directly enter through the hadronic decay width of the Z.
