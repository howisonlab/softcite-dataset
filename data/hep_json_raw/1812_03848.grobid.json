The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of Z boson decays into electron-positron pairs.

For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV.

This paper presents the calibration of the energy measurement of electrons and photons achieved with the ATLAS detector using 36 fb \u22121 of LHC proton\u2212proton collision data collected in 2015 and 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The calibration scheme comprises a simulation-based optimization of the energy resolution for electrons and photons, corrections accounting for differences between data and simulation, the adjustment of the absolute energy scale using Z boson decays into e + e \u2212 pairs, and the validation of the energy scale universality using J/\u03c8 decays decays into e + e \u2212 pairs and radiative Z boson decays. This strategy closely follows the procedure used for the final energy calibration applied to the data collected in 2011 and 2012 (Run 1) [1], with updates to reflect the changes in data-taking and detector conditions. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the ATLAS detector and the reconstruction of electron and photon candidates. Section 3 introduces the calibration procedure and the changes relative to the Run 1 calibration. Section 4 gives a list of the different data and simulated event samples used in these studies. Section 5 explains how the simulated event samples are used to optimize the estimate of electron and photon energies, as well as the expected resolutions of the energy measurements. Section 6 describes the different corrections applied to the data. Section 7 discusses the extraction of the overall energy scale and resolution corrections between data and simulation from Z \u2192 ee decays. Section 8 describes the different systematic uncertainties affecting the energy scale and resolution. Finally section 9 presents the cross-checks performed using independent data samples.",

It is divided into a barrel section (EMB), covering the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two endcap sections (EMEC), covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5, the EM calorimeter is divided into three layers in depth. Each layer is segmented in \u03b7-\u03c6 projective readout cells. The first layer is finely segmented in the \u03b7 direction for the regions 0 < |\u03b7| < 1.4 and 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.4 with a cell size in \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 varying from 0.003 \u00d7 0.1 in the barrel region to 0.006 \u00d7 0.1 in the region |\u03b7| > 2.0. The fine segmentation in the \u03b7 direction provides event-by-event discrimination between single-photon or single-electron showers and overlapping showers produced in the decays of neutral hadrons. The first layer's thickness varies between 3 and 5 radiation lengths, depending on \u03b7. The second layer collects most of the energy deposited in the calorimeter by electron and photon showers. Its thickness is between 17 and 20 radiation lengths and the cell size is 0.025 \u00d7 0.025 in \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6. A third layer with cell size of 0.050 \u00d7 0.025 and thickness of 2 to 10 radiation lengths is used to correct for the leakage beyond the EM calorimeter. A high-voltage system generates an electric field of about 1 kV/mm between the lead absorbers and copper electrodes located at the middle of the liquid-argon gaps. It induces ionization electrons to drift in the gap. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.8, a thin presampler layer, located in front of the accordion calorimeter, is used to correct for energy loss upstream of the calorimeter.

For a uniform energy deposit in the gap, the signal has a triangular shape as a function of time with a length corresponding to the maximum drift time of the ionization electrons, typically 450 ns. This signal is amplified and shaped by a bipolar filter in the front-end readout boards [4] to reduce the effect of out-of-time energy deposits from collisions in the following or previous bunch crossings. To accommodate the required dynamic range, three different gains (high, medium and low) are used. The shaped and amplified signals are sampled at 40 MHz and, for each first-level trigger, digitized by a 12-bit analogue-to-digital (ADC) converter. The medium gain for the sample corresponding to the maximum expected amplitude is digitized first to choose the most suited gain. Four time samples for the selected gain are then digitized and sent to the off-detector electronics via optical fibres.

Clusters without matching tracks are classified as unconverted photons. Converted photon candidates are defined as clusters matched to a track consistent with originating from a photon conversion in the material of the ID or matched to a two-track vertex consistent with the photon conversion hypothesis [8]. The definition of converted photon candidate includes requirements on the number of hits in the innermost pixel detector layer and on the fraction of high-threshold hits in the transition radiation tracker. The energy of the electron or photon is estimated using an area corresponding to 3 \u00d7 7 (5 \u00d7 5) second-layer cells in the barrel (endcap) region. Photon identification is based primarily on shower shapes in the calorimeter. Two levels of selection, Loose and Tight, are defined [8].

Compared with this improved description, the changes for the results presented in this paper are: the addition of the new innermost pixel layer and the new beam pipe in Run 2 [25][26][27], the modification of the pixel detector services at small radius [28] and a re-tuning in the simulation of the amount of material in the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeter cryostats to agree better with the measurement performed with Run 1 data. The amount of material in front of the presampler detector is about 1.8 radiation lengths at small values of |\u03b7|, reaching \u2248 4 radiation lengths at the end of the EMB acceptance and up to 6 radiation lengths close to |\u03b7| = 1.7. The amount of material located between the presampler and the first layer of the calorimeter is typically 0.5 to 1.5 radiation lengths except in the transition region between the EMB and EMEC, where it is larger. For |\u03b7| > 1.8, the total amount of material in front of the calorimeter is typically 3 radiation lengths. The simulation models the details of the readout electronics response following the same ingredients as described in eq. (2.1).",

A single correction for all of these effects is computed using multivariate regression -8 -algorithms tuned on samples of simulated single particles without pile-up, separately for electrons, converted photons and unconverted photons. The training of the algorithm, based on Boosted Decision Trees, is done in intervals of |\u03b7| and of transverse energy. An updated version of the method described in ref. [1] is implemented.

To mitigate this effect, information from the E 4 scintillators [2] installed in the transition region is used. The E 4 scintillators are part of the intermediate tile calorimeter (ITC). The ITC is located in the gap region, between the long barrel and the extended barrels of the tile calorimeter and it was designed to correct for the energy lost in the passive material that fills the gap region. Electrons and photons in the gap region deposit energy in the barrel and the endcap of the EM calorimeter, as well as in the E 4 scintillators. In this region, the energy deposited in the E 4 cells (each of size \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.1 \u00d7 0.1) and the difference between the cluster position and the centre of the E 4 cell are added to the set of input variables for the regression algorithm. Due to this additional information the energy resolution is improved as shown in figure 1 for simulated electrons generated with transverse energy between 50 GeV and 100 GeV. In this range, the improvement is largest for electrons (around 20%), while it is smaller for unconverted photons (5%). Such behaviour is expected, as the degradation of the energy resolution due to inactive material in front of the calorimeter is much higher for electrons.",

The result is extrapolated to a zero pile-up value to measure the intrinsic energy scale of each calorimeter layer for a pure signal. This extrapolation is performed using a first-order polynomial fit, which is found to describe data and MC results well. The fit is performed in the range from 12 to 30 interactions per bunch crossing to avoid low-statistics bins with a large range of the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The method is validated by comparing the MC extrapolated results with the ones obtained in a MC sample without any pile-up. The final result is given by the average of the two signal extraction methods, fit and truncated mean. Figure 4 shows examples of the fitted MPV of the deposited muon energy as a function of the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The accurate noise modelling, performed separately for data and simulation, allows the extraction of the MPV of the muon energy deposit with only a small dependence with pile-up. The small slope of the fitted line limits the impact of the extrapolation from the average amount of pile-up in data to the zero pile-up point to the percent level.",

The value of the high voltage is used to derive a correction applied in the cell-level calibration. Residual effects can arise for cases where large currents are drawn. In these cases, the correction is not computed accurately. The \u03b7-\u03c6 profiles of E/p in 2015 and 2016 data are used to derive empirical corrections in the regions which are known to be operated at non-nominal HV values. The values of the corrections are typically 1% to 7% and affect 2% of the |\u03b7| < 2.5 calorimeter acceptance. Most of these corrections are similar to the ones computed in ref.

The decrease in the ratio near a mass of 96 GeV is most likely related to imperfect modelling of the tails of the energy resolution by the simulation, which affects the extraction of the energy scale and resolution correction factors. This variation is covered by the estimated uncertainties in the correction factors. Within these uncertainties, the data and simulation are in fair agreement.   Figure 8.

The effect on the energy response is estimated assuming a linear temperature variation as a function of \u03b7 in the endcap. In addition, there is a small change in the LAr temperature of the different cryostats in the absence of collisions between 2015 and 2016.",

The current I induced on the HV line is equal to the total ionization current, from the drift of electrons and ions, which is created by the steady flux of deposited energy in the calorimeter. Since there is a significant resistance, R, between the power supply where the voltage is set to a constant value and the LAr gap, the voltage effectively applied to the gap is reduced by R \u00d7 I. The pattern of resistances across the LAr electrodes [31] is quite complex, but the dominant contribution to the resistance is due to the filter-box resistance in the high-voltage feedthrough [32]. The HV drop can thus be estimated from the current drawn by the power supply and the value of the filter-box resistance, which is 100 k\u2126 for the EM calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 2.5). The change in HV induces a change in the calorimeter response because the drift velocity of ionization electrons varies approximately with the power 0.3 of the electric field in the gap [33][34][35] and the amplitude of the shaped calorimeter signal is proportional to the drift velocity.",

The differences between data and simulation are, within statistical uncertainties, mostly consistent between electrons and photons.

For simplification, only one uncertainty variation is assigned to the statistical accuracy of the Z \u2192 ee calibration since this uncertainty is always negligible compared with the other uncertainties. Figure 14 illustrates the impact of the main systematic uncertainties affecting the energy scale of electrons, unconverted photons and converted photons at |\u03b7| = 0.3 as a function of the transverse energy. For a given uncertainty variation, the effect on the energy can be positive or negative with a possible change of sign near the average E T of electrons from Z decays. This is illustrated in this figure by showing the signed uncertainty, i.e. the impact of a one-sided variation of the systematic -33 -uncertainties. The opposite-sign variation will give a systematic impact with the opposite sign. Keeping track of the relative sign across E T and \u03b7 of the impact of each uncertainty source is important for properly computing the total uncertainty for a sample covering a range of E T and \u03b7 values. At given values of both E T and \u03b7, the total systematic uncertainty is given by the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties related to each of the independent uncertainty sources.  To illustrate the \u03b7-dependence of the different uncertainties, table 4 gives the photon energy scale systematic uncertainties for E T = 60 GeV in wide \u03b7 regions corresponding to either the barrel or the endcap acceptance. A uniform \u03b7 distribution of the photons is assumed. The typical photon energy scale uncertainty is 0.2% to 0.3% averaged over the barrel and 0.45% to 0.8% in the endcap. For this value of E T , the uncertainties from the relative calibration of the different layers is significantly smaller for converted photons than for unconverted photons as they have a longitudinal shower development closer to that of E T = 40 GeV electrons.

The impact of uncertainties in the detector material upstream of the calorimeter on the energy resolution is derived from simulations with additional material as described in section 8.4. The uncertainty in the electronics and pile-up noise modelling is derived from a comparison of data -35 -and simulation for a sample of zero-bias events introduced in section 6.1. The noise is typically 350-400 MeV expressed in transverse energy. The noise uncertainty is defined as the difference in quadrature between the noise in data and simulation and is found to be 100 MeV in terms of transverse energy. Finally, the energy resolution's constant term is derived from the data-tosimulation comparison of the energy resolution for electrons from Z \u2192 ee decays, as described in section 7.",
