The dataset consists of an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The Z bosons are identified through their decays either to charged, light, lepton pairs (e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) or to hadrons. The data are found to be consistent with the expected background in the whole mass range investigated and upper limits are set on the production cross section times decay branching ratio to Z \u03b3 of a narrow scalar boson with mass between 250 GeV and 2.75 TeV.",

This suggests that a broad experimental survey of physics beyond the SM can be made by searching for new massive bosons. Some models predict that these bosons decay to final states containing the SM electroweak W or Z bosons or photons [1,2]. Attractive decays from an experimental perspective are to \u03b3 \u03b3 [3][4][5][6], Z \u03b3 [7,8] or Z Z [9,10] final states, since both the Z bosons and photons in pair production can be measured well with relatively low backgrounds. If such new bosons were produced, the complete reconstruction of these final states could be used to precisely measure their properties, such as their mass.",

Due to the assumed narrow width of the X boson and the small contribution of gluon fusion to the non-resonant SM production of Z + \u03b3 [21], the interference between the gg \u2192 X \u2192 Z \u03b3 signal process and the SM gg \u2192 Z \u03b3 background is neglected in the simulation. The signal samples are generated with POWHEG-BOX [22,23] interfaced to Pythia 8.186 for the underlying event, parton showering and hadronization. The CT10 [24] PDF set and the AZNLO tune [25] of the underlying event are used.",

In the leptonic analysis, the transverse momentum of photon candidates is initially required to pass a loose preselection, p T > 15 GeV, whereas the final photon p T requirement is applied when a Z \u03b3 candidate is reconstructed, as described later. In the hadronic analysis, the photon transverse momentum is required to be larger than 250 GeV. To reduce background from hadronic jets, photon candidates are required to satisfy a set of requirements on the shower leakage in the hadronic calorimeter and on the transverse shower profile measured with the first two layers of the electromagnetic calorimeter [33]. The requirements were optimized using simulated samples of photons and hadronic jets produced in 13 TeV pp collisions. The efficiency of the identification criteria is about 98% for converted photon candidates and 94% for unconverted photon candidates with p T > 100 GeV. Background from hadronic jets is further reduced by requiring the transverse energy measured in the calorimeter in a cone of size R = 0.4 around the photon direction (E T,iso [35], also called calorimeter isolation in the following) to be less than 2.45GeV + 0.022 \u00d7 p T . Electron candidates are required to have p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47, excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcaps in the EM calorimeter (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52). To suppress background from hadronic jets, electron candidates are required to satisfy likelihood-based identification criteria [36]. Such requirements provide approximately 85% identification efficiency for electrons with a transverse momentum of 20 GeV, increasing to 95% Track and calorimeter isolation requirements are further applied to the selected leptons. For electrons, combined criteria are applied to the calorimeter isolation, E T,iso , in a cone of radius R = 0.2, and to the track isolation, tracks p T , in a cone of radius R = 0.2 for electron transverse momenta p T < 50 GeV and of radius R = (10 GeV)/p T for p T > 50 GeV. In the calculation of the track isolation, the contribution from the electron track itself is not included. The criteria are chosen to provide an efficiency of about 99% independent of the electron transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, as determined in a control sample of Z \u2192 ee decays selected with a tag-and-probe technique [36]. For muons, combined criteria are imposed on E T,iso in a cone of radius R = 0.2 and on tracks p T inside a cone of radius R = 0.3 for muon transverse momenta p T < 33 GeV and of radius R = (10 GeV)/p T for p T > 33 GeV. The efficiency of these criteria increases with the muon transverse momentum, reaching 95% at 25 GeV and 99% at 60 GeV, as measured in Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events selected with a tag-andprobe method [37].",

To increase the number of Z + \u03b3 MC events, a very large (up to one thousand times more events than in data) simulated sample is obtained by passing the events generated by Sherpa through a fast simulation of the calorimeter response [52].

No significant excess in the invariant-mass distribution of the final-state particles due to a scalar boson with a narrow width (4 MeV) was found over the smoothly falling background.Limits at 95% CL using a profile-likelihood ratio method were set on the production cross section times decay branching ratio to",
