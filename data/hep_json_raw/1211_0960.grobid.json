The experiment was conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute using a timestructured, nearly 100% polarized surface muon beam and a segmented, fast-timing plastic scintillator array. The measurement employed two target arrangements: a magnetized ferromagnetic target with a $4 kG internal magnetic field and a crystal quartz target in a 130 G external magnetic field. Approximately 1:6 \u00c2 10 12 positrons were accumulated and together the data yield a muon lifetime of \u00f0MuLan\u00de \u00bc 2196980:3\u00f02:2\u00de ps (1.0 ppm), 30 times more precise than previous generations of lifetime experiments. The lifetime measurement yields the most accurate value of the Fermi constant G F \u00f0MuLan\u00de \u00bc 1:1663787\u00f06\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c05 GeV \u00c02 (0.5 ppm). It also enables new precision studies of weak interactions via lifetime measurements of muonic atoms.",

This strength is governed by the Fermi constant [1].",

To compensate for long-timescale gain drifts, the PMT high voltages were adjusted on several occasions during each running period. 5 The detector was designed to minimize vulnerability to gain changes.

The fit-function minimum defines the normal amplitude threshold A thr , corresponding to the valley between the low-energy noise and the positron MIP peak. This threshold is recalculated every 100(10) runs in R06 (R07) data taking in order to account for the observed, long-timescale drifts in the detector gains over the datataking period. Additional data sets, with higher thresholds of A thr \u00fe 20, A thr \u00fe 30, and A thr \u00fe 40, are processed for studying the effects of gain variations during the measurement period.",

The factor of 2 in Eq. (11) arises because gain changes of both inner and outer tiles can alter the abovethreshold coincidences. Using the measured MPV versus measurement time and Eq. (11), the time histograms are then corrected for gain variations. In one approach, the measured \u00c1A MPV distribution is converted to a hit variation \u00c1N and used to subtract (add) the extra (lost) hits from gain changes. In another approach, the MPV distribution is first fit to an empirical function describing the gain changes. This function is then converted from MPV versus measurement time to hits versus measurement time and used to make the gain correction (this approach is helpful in understanding the sensitivity of to oscillations and drifts). The gain corrections are applied separately to Electron Tube and Photonis PMTs.",

The error bar on the ADT \u00bc 0 point corresponds to the statistical variation allowed between the ''true'' lifetime that omits the pulse pileup, accidental coincidences, and timing jitter, and the ADT > 0 lifetimes that correct for pulse pileup, accidental coincidences, and timing jitter.

We believe this originates from the partial alignment of the AK-3 magnetic domains along the AK-3 magnetization axis. Consequently, while P 1 accrues only small contributions from stops in domains oriented nearly perpendicular to the spin axis, it accrues much larger contributions from stops in domains oriented more parallel to the spin axis. The result is an ensemble-averaged longitudinal polarization that is roughly parallel to the beam axis. The LF SR effect on the fitted lifetime versus detector coordinate is roughly 10 ppm. Supplemental data was acquired that enhanced P 1 . The circular cross-section target, with its B field oriented at 90 to the beam axis, was replaced by an elliptical cross-section target with its B field oriented at 45 to the beam axis. This increased the component of the AK-3 magnetization along the spin axis. The ellipticaltarget data shows a four-fold increase in lifetime variation with detector coordinate . This is qualitatively consistent with the expected increase in the polarization P 1 . 14 It supports our argument that the dependence of the fitted lifetime originates from a longitudinal relaxation in the AK-3 target, and therefore will cancel in sums of opposite tile pairs. involving the normalized time distributions of the coincidence hits N U=D \u00f0t\u00de in the upstream/downstream hemispheres of the positron detector. 15 This diagnostic is sensitive to time-dependent differences between upstream/downstream hits and clearly shows a TF precession signal with a frequency ! $ 11 s \u00c01 and a time constant T 2 $ 5 s. The value of ! agrees with the expected value for a diamagnetic \u00fe population in the 130 G Halbach magnet field. The relative amplitude of the TF SR signal in the production data is only $10 \u00c03 . To further study the TF SR signal, a supplemental data set was acquired by shortening the accumulation period from T A \u00bc 5:0 to 0:15 s and thereby reducing roughly 20-fold the spin dephasing during muon accumulation. As depicted in Fig. 20 (lower panel), the ratio R UD \u00f0t\u00de obtained with T A \u00bc 0:15 s shows a large TF signal consistent with a 20-fold enhancement of the production data signal. Fits using Eq. (14) to the time histograms derived from the T A \u00bc 0:15 s data set indicate a quartz diamagnetic \u00fe population of roughly 6-7%, in good agreement with published work [28,29].",

The result corresponds to an overall uncertainty in the muon lifetime of 2.2 ps or 1.0 ppm. Figure 28 and Table V summarize the measurements of the positive muon lifetime over the past forty years. They include the MuLan R06 and R07 results, the MuLan commissioning measurement (Chitwood) [18], the FAST commissioning measurement (Barczyk) [16], and the earlier work of Duclos et al. [48], Balandin et al. [15,47], Giovanetti et al. [13], and Bardin et al. [14]. The final result from the combined R06 and R07 data sets is a factor of 10 15  Table V gives a lifetime \u00bc 2196981:1 AE 2:2 ps with a chi-squared 2 =dof \u00bc 2:7. The weighted average is dominated by our final R06 \u00fe R07 result with the poor chi-squared originating from the disagreement between our final result and the FAST commissioning result.",
