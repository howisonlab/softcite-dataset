The non-zero value of the third neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 allows experimental analysis in a manner which explicitly exhibits appearance and disappearance dependencies on additional parameters associated with mass-hierarchy, CP violation, and any non-maximal \u03b8 23 . These current and near-future experiments begin the era of precision accelerator long-baseline measurements and lay the framework within which future experimental results will be interpreted.",

            "text": "Beginning with the successful operation of the K2K experiment [1], the physics community has seen a profound expansion of our knowledge of the mixing of neutrinos, driven by long-baseline accelerator experiments [2][3][4][5][6], experiments studying atmospheric neutrinos [7][8][9], solar neutrinos [10], and, most recently, high-precision experiments with reactor neutrinos [11]. In this article we describe the current generation of the running longbaseline neutrino experiments T2K and MINOS/MINOS+ , and the status of the NOvA experiment which was commissioned in 2014. Each of these experiments was designed with primary and secondary goals. For example, MINOS had as its principle justification the measurement, via disappearance of \u03bd \u03bc , of the mixing parameters sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u0394 m 2 32 , with particular emphasis on \u0394 m 2 32 . T2K and NOvA were primarily designed to elucidate the structure of the neutrino sector by studies of \u03bd e appearance. However they are making and will continue to make very significant contributions to the study of \u03bd \u03bc disappearance as well. Similarly, MINOS has measured \u03bd e appearance and the angle \u03b8 13 .",

We will first discuss the relevant formalism and the major measurements required to test it.

Datataking with the beam began in March of 2005, and continues to this time. The complex currently consists of a primary beam transport, the NuMI target hall, a 675 meter He-filled decay pipe of one meter radius, a hadron absorber and muon flux monitor area, meters of rock shielding, and two experimental halls-the first housing the MINOS near detector and the MINERvA detector, and the second housing the NOvA near detector. Figure 1 shows the general configuration of the beamline. Beam from the Fermilab Booster is accelerated in the Main Injector to 120 GeV, and then extracted with a system of fast kickers. As part of an upgrade to beam power, commissioning is underway to stack beam in the Fermilab recycler ring before transfer to the main injector. At the NuMI target the proton beam consists of six batches, with a total extraction period of 10 \u03bcs. The time between extractions has varied from 2.2 s to the current 1.3 s. This low duty factor allows the MINOS and NOvA experiments to trigger on a simple timing window, which facilitates the surface location of the NOvA far detector. Overlaying multiple injections from the booster in the main injector (slip-stacking) has allowed the beam intensity to reach 375 kW. The NuMI beam for NOvA is anticipated to reach 700 kW, with a similar time structure.",

The NuMI targets used for MINOS data taking were constructed of 47 segmented graphite fins. A total of seven targets were used in the period 2005 to 2012, with exchanges usually due to failures in auxiliary cooling systems. In one case the target material experienced significant degradation, visible in the produced neutrino rates. Significant engineering changes have occurred for the targets to be used in the NOvA beam, which must withstand 700 kW operations. These include detailed changes to the graphite fins to allow for an increase in primary beam spot size from 1.1 to 1.3 mm, and, importantly, a significant relocation of the water cooling tubing to decrease its vulnerability. With these changes, it is expected that the NuMI targets in the NOvA era will survive a minimum of a year of high power operation before any replacement is needed.",

The far and near detectors minimize passive mass, moving toward the ideal of a totally active fiducial volume which will be realized with future detectors, such as e.g. DUNE liquid argon TPC\u02bcs. A totally active detector typically has better performance because all charged particles in neutrino interactions are reconstructed properly with good efficiency. In the case of NOvA the active medium is liquid scintillator mixed into oil. The basic segmentation of the detector is planes of 3.6 cm\uf0a0\u00d7\uf0a05.6 cm PVC tubes, separated by thin walls. Light is collected in each tube by a looped wavelength shifting fiber that is directed onto a single pixel of an avalanche photodiode (APD).
