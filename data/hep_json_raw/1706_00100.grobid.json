This significant annual modulation, measured over 4 years, can mimic the signature for dark matter and can also generate potential background events for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay experiments. The measured annual modulation of the event rate from (\u03b1, \u03b3) reactions is strongly correlated with the time-varying radon concentration observed independently in the Lab. The \u03b1 flux from radon decay is simulated starting from the measured radon concentration, and the \u03b3-ray flux is determined using the convolution of the \u03b1 flux and the cross sections for (\u03b1, \u03b3) reactions. The calculated \u03b3-ray flux is sufficient to generate the measured event rate that exhibits an annual modulation.",

            "text": "Observations starting from the 1930s [1] have led to the understanding that 80% of the matter in the universe neither emits nor absorbs electromagnetic radiation [2,3]. A popular candidate for dark matter is the WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) [4,5], a fundamental particle with a mass of tens to hundreds of GeV and interactions at the weak scale. In the past decade, a number of theories [6,7] have renewed interest in looking for light (MeV-scale) dark matter, giving rise to new proposals for experimental technologies that can detect extremely low energy depositions. Both types of dark matter should present an annual modulation signal due to the relative motion of the Earth around the Sun [8], thus providing a critical signature which would confirm the dark matter hypothesis, when confronted with a significant measured excess. While most background sources cannot mimic the details of the expected annual modulation [8][9][10], there are exceptions, such as muon-induced processes [11] and radon concentration [12,13] in mine drifts. With better understanding of these backgrounds, we can improve our ability to detect and confirm dark matter signals, as well as improve the sensitivity of other rare-event experiments such as the search for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay.",

            "text": "Backgrounds can be classified as either radiogenic or cosmogenic. Cosmogenic backgrounds come from cosmic rays, where the resulting muons produce high energy neutrons in the surrounding rock via the muon spallation process [14]. Radiogenic backgrounds are produced by natural radioactivity, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium decays. In the radiogenic processes, \u03b3 rays and neutrons are generated by natural radioactivity decays, \u03b1 interactions with surrounding materials, and the spontaneous fission decay of uranium and thorium in rocks. The fluxes of \u03b3 rays and neutrons depend on the underground site and the elemental make-up in the surrounding materials. Radon, a source of radiogenic background, represents a major threat to all rare-event experiments performed in underground labs. Though the level of radon can be mitigated by using proper ventilation and air circulation inside the underground laboratory, the residual radon concentration inside the air depends on the local geology (production) and experimental spaces (efficacy of mitigation). Thus, radiogenic backgrounds are independent of the depth of the laboratory, whereas cosmogenic processes are related through their muon predecessors to the depth of the underground site [15].",

EJ301 is specially designed for neutron-\u03b3 pulse shape discrimination [24], with a H/C ratio 1.212 and density 0.874 g/cm 3 . Two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), one at each end of the cylinder were used to collect the scintillation light produced inside.

The \u03b3 rays passed through a lead collimator and were used to calibrate the position scale by coincidence measurements along the length of the detector, every 5 cm (20 sections in all). Figure 1 summarizes the results from the multiple calibration procedures described above and requires some explanation. Its overall triangular shape is defined by the fact that events near the ends of the cylindrical detector saturate one of the ADC channels rendering the data unusable. This happens more frequently, the higher the energy of the event. The faint, lower yellow band is due to the AmBe source and the higher yellow energy band shows the response to minimum ionizing muons (\u223c20 MeV deposited in this detector). The horizontal nature of the yellow bands demonstrate that the detected energy is independent of its position along the tube, where X/l=0 represents the mid point of the detector. The red in the lower part of the graph is due to a local concentration of radioactivity. . Plot of \u221a a 0 \u00d7 a 1 vs X/l [16], [22]. Where, \u221a a 0 \u00d7 a 1 represents the total energy deposited in the detector, a 0 and a 1 are the charge collected at the two ends of the detector and X/l describes the relative position of the particle in the detector, l is the attenuation length and X is the distance between the mid point of the detector and the point where a high energy event is deposited.",

Since the thermal velocity of radon and its air-borne daughters is about 1.83\u00d710 4 cm/s, this provides a flux of particles (\u223c 10.16 cm -2 s -1 ) that can intersect the target surface. The average range of \u03b1 particles in air is approximately 3.2 cm. According to the Bragg-Kleeman rule [31], the average range of \u03b1 particles in aluminum, silicon, and oxygen is 0.002 cm, 0.0023 cm and 3.07 cm respectively. Therefore, if \u03b1 particles are produced by radon in the air, they cannot contribute to (\u03b1,\u03b3) reactions in any significant way and are neglected. Thus, there remain two ways to generate the \u03b1 particles which will eventually produce a flux of \u03b3 rays with energy in the range of 4 -10 MeV. One is radon plateout, where radon daughters adhere to the surface of the target, after which \u03b1 particles are produced through subsequent decays. Secondly, since radon is a gas with a half life of 3.82 days, it can first diffuse into the target and then decay to generate \u03b1 particles.",

Thus, the effective interaction zone in which (\u03b1,\u03b3) reactions occur is the combination of radon diffusion length in aluminum and the average range of \u03b1 particles in aluminum.

This rock composition is typical of basalt with a density \u03c1 = (2.75 -2.95) g/cm 2 . In the calculation of the \u03b3 ray flux from different targets, we choose the three most abundant of these elements: oxygen (\u223c45%), silicon (\u223c24%), and aluminum (\u223c8%). The excited states of these nuclei have \u03b3 rays with energy greater than 6 MeV. Since \u03b3 rays will mostly undergo Compton scattering in the detector, the energy deposition from those high-energy gamma rays can be in the energy region of 4 -10 MeV. The cross section term in Eq. 1 was determined using the TALYS nuclear reaction modeling method [35]. Reaction cross sections were calculated for \u03b1 particles which interact with the three different target elements considered. Figure 5 illustrates that the resulting cross section is highly energydependent. Figure 5. (Color online).

Although there are 22 isotopes of aluminum [36], 27 Al is the only stable isotope of aluminum occurring naturally. 27 Al has a natural abundance of approximately 99.9%. The contribution from the Al 2 O 3 rock component was also calculated, but contributes very little. Figure 6 shows the calculated \u03b3 ray-ray flux for the aluminum target. Silicon has 24 isotopes, of which three are stable: 28 Si, 29 Si, and 30 Si [29]. The natural abundance of isotope 28 Si is 92.22%, 29 Si is 4.68% and 30 Si is 3.09%. Therefore, 28 Si is used for the calculation. Figure 7 displays the calculated \u03b3-ray for the silicon target. Oxygen isotopes are present everywhere inside the mine, in both the air and in the rock. There are 17 isotopes of oxygen, of which three are stable [37]: 16 O, 17 O and 18 O. Since 16 O has a natural abundance of 99.76%, this is the isotope considered in the calculation. Since oxygen exists in air and in rock, the \u03b3-ray yields were calculated separately and added together afterwards.  The \u03b3-ray flux calculated for the three different reaction channels is summarized in Table II. These fluxes are integrated \u03b3 fluxes in the energy region (4 -10) MeV. It is clear that the aluminum and silicon targets yield a higher \u03b3-ray flux than the oxygen. ",

            "text": "In Table IV, the annual modulation fit parameters from our scintillator detector are compared to those expected from dark matter assuming a standard halo [39], as well as to the CoGeNT fit. While the amplitude and period of all three are similar, the phases differ significantly. Co-GeNT finds an earlier maximum of mid-April, while this work finds an early August maximum. The standard halo model for WIMPs predicts a maximum in early June. In this case, it is unlikely that the radon-induced (\u03b1, \u03b3) reaction is responsible for the signal observed by CoGeNT. However, it is also clear that these reactions can easily create signals as large as the effect due to dark matter and thus need to be properly accounted for in any fit to a putative signal. In conclusion, this study describes a type of background that could be important for experiments related to the direct search for dark matter and neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay. The significant annual modulation in-duced by \u03b3 rays from (\u03b1, \u03b3) reactions can mimic the signature for dark matter and generate potential background events for neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay experiments, since 4 -10 MeV \u03b3 rays are capable of penetrating an outer shield to undergo Compton scattering in an inner shield or undergo a photo-nuclear reaction which generates neutrons in an inner shield. The \u03b3 flux in the 4 -10 MeV range depends on the surrounding materials of the laboratory and rock cavities inside the mine, while energies above 10 MeV depend on the depth of the laboratory.",
