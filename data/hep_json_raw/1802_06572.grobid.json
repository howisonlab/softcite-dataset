Since the top quark decays almost always to a W boson and a b-quark, the decay of a top quark pair produces six particles in the final state, whose identity depends on the decays of the intermediate W bosons. The channel considered in this analysis is characterised by the leptonic decay of one W boson and the hadronic decay of the other W boson; this is commonly referred to as semileptonic decay mode or +jets channel. The final-state configuration contains one electron or muon, one neutrino giving rise to missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) and four jets, two of which originate from b-quarks. Events may include additional jets from gluon radiation off initial-or final-state quarks. To study the dependence of this emission on the observables, three configurations are defined depending on the number of additional jets produced within the detector acceptance in association with the top quark pair: the \"4-jet exclusive configuration\" (no additional jets); the \"5-jet exclusive configuration\" (only one additional jet); and the \"6-jet inclusive configuration\" (two or more additional jets). The latter configuration is of particular interest since it provides a similar phase space to the one used by measurements such as Higgs boson production in association with two top quarks and searches with high jet multiplicity.",

In addition, the differential cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the hadronic top quark (p t,had T ) is measured. In previous publications [1,8], differences between the data and the predictions by several Standard Model Monte Carlo (MC) event generators were observed. By measuring the differential cross section of this observable in different jet multiplicities it is possible to identify the regions of phase space in which the discrepancy is largest. The measured differential cross sections as functions of these three observables are compared to predictions from several MC event generators, namely Powheg-Box [14], MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [15] and Sherpa [16].",

The innermost pixel layer, the insertable Blayer [18], was added before the start of 13 TeV LHC operation at an average radius of 33 mm around a new, thinner beam pipe. The inner detector is embedded in a superconducting solenoid generating a 2 T axial magnetic field, allowing precise measurements of charged-particle momenta. Sampling calorimeters with several different designs span the pseudorapidity range up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. High-granularity liquid argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters are used up to |\u03b7| = 3.2. Hadronic calorimeters based on scintillator-tile active material cover |\u03b7| < 1.7 while LAr technology is used for hadronic calorimetry in the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The calorimeters are surrounded by a muon spectrometer within a magnetic field provided by air-core toroid magnets with a bending integral of about 2.5 Tm in the barrel and up to 6 Tm in the end-caps. Three stations of precision drift tubes and cathode-strip chambers provide an accurate measurement of the muon track curvature in the region |\u03b7| < 2.7.

The factorisation and hadronisation scales are set to m 2 t + p 2 T,t where m t and p T,t are the top quark mass and the transverse momentum of the top quark, respectively, evaluated for the underlying Born configuration. Events in which both W bosons JHEP10(2018)159 decay hadronically were not included. For this process, the top quarks were decayed using MadSpin [29] to preserve all spin correlations, while parton shower, hadronisation, and the underlying event were simulated using Pythia6.428 [30] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [31] and the Perugia2012 tune [32]. The h damp parameter, which controls the p T of the first gluon or quark emission beyond the Born configuration in Powheg, was set to the mass of the top quark [33]. The main effect of this parameter is to regulate the high-p T emission against which the tt system recoils. Signal tt events generated with those settings are referred to as the nominal signal sample.",

Jet four-momenta are then corrected for pile-up effects using the jet-area method [62]. To reduce the number of jets originating from pileup, an additional selection criterion based on a jet-vertex tagging technique is applied. The jet-vertex tagging is a likelihood discriminant that combines information from several trackbased variables [63] and the criterion is only applied to jets with p T < 60GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.

Since the mis-modelling is observed in regions of p T in which the cross section in that configuration is subdominant, it could not be observed in the previous measurement. The Powheg+Herwig++ prediction does not model the data well in all configurations.

This sample has an h damp = m t and the factorisation and renormalisation scales increased by a factor of two compared to their nominal value. Since the h damp parameter in the 'radLo' calculation is the same as the one in the nominal sample, it is possible to conclude that the reason for the different behaviour is due to the scale variation.
