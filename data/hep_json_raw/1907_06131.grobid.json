The searches are based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . No significant excess is observed above the expected background from Standard Model processes. The observed (median expected) 95% confidence-level upper limits on the leptonflavour-violating branching ratios are 0.47% (0.34 +0.13 \u22120.10 %) and 0.28% (0.37 +0.14 \u22120.10 %) for H \u2192 e\u03c4 and H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 , respectively.",

Theoretical uncertainties affecting the ggF signal originate from nine sources [24]. Two sources account for yield uncertainties, which are evaluated by an overall variation of all relevant scales and are correlated across all bins of the BDT discriminant distribution [81]. Another two sources account for migration uncertainties of zero to one jet and one to at least two jets in the event [81][82][83], two for Higgs boson p T shape uncertainties, one for the treatment of the top-quark mass in the loop corrections, and two for the acceptance uncertainties of ggF production in the VBF phase space from selecting exactly two and at least three jets, respectively [84,85]. For VBF and W H, Z H production cross-sections, the uncertainties due to missing higher-order QCD corrections are estimated by varying the factorization and renormalization scales up and down by factors of two around the nominal scale. For all signal samples, PDF uncertainties are estimated using 30 eigenvector variations and two \u03b1 s variations using the default PDF set PDF4LHC15 [32]. Uncertainties related to the simulation of the underlying event, hadronization and parton shower are estimated by comparing the acceptances when using Pythia 8.212 [25] or Herwig 7.0.3 [86,87].",

Since a different \u03c4 -ID working point is considered in this analysis, fake factors are re-derived as a function of p T and track multiplicity of the \u03c4 had-vis candidate.Electrons misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis , denoted by \" Z \u2192 ee(d.d.)\" in the following figures and tables, represent another background component in the e\u03c4 had channel, with a contribution about five times smaller than that of jets misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis . While the rate of electrons misidentified as 3-prong \u03c4 had-vis makes a negligible contribution and is modelled by simulation, the rate of electrons misidentified as 1-prong \u03c4 had-vis is determined with a fake-factor method. This time, the fake factor is defined as the ratio of the number of events with tight \u03c4 -ID to the number of events with anti-identified \u03c4 had-vis (such a candidate satisfies all criteria but the requirement on the high electron ID score is inverted). These fake factors are derived in a dedicated Z \u2192 ee enriched region defined by |m vis \u2212 m Z | < 5 GeV, m T ( , E miss T ) < 40 GeV, and m T (\u03c4 had-vis , E miss T) < 60 GeV, where the \u03c4 had-vis candidate satisfies the medium \u03c4 -ID (corresponding to an efficiency of 55% and 40% for 1-prong and 3-prong candidates, respectively) but not the tight \u03c4 -ID criterion to avoid overlap with the \u03c4 had signal region.These fake factors are applied to signal-like events with the antiidentified \u03c4 had-vis to determine the background contribution in the categories of the analysis. The systematic uncertainties include the statistical uncertainty of the fake factors and account for looser \u03c4 -ID in the Z \u2192 ee enriched region as well as for the subtraction of the not misidentified components in this region.",
