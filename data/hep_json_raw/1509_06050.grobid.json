This increased the interest in Supersymmetry (SUSY) and Grand Unified Theories, especially since the SM has no candidate for the elusive dark matter, while Supersymmetry provides an excellent candidate for dark matter. In addition, Supersymmetry removes the quadratic divergencies of the SM and predicts the Higgs mechanism from radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with a SM-like Higgs boson having a mass below 130 GeV in agreement with the Higgs boson discovery at the LHC. However, the predicted SUSY particles have not been found either because they are too heavy for the present LHC energy and luminosity or Nature has found alternative ways to circumvent the shortcomings of the SM.",

The first problem was solved in 1964 by Higgs and others, [2][3][4][5] who proposed that gauge boson masses are generated by interactions with an omnipresent scalar (Higgs) field in the vacuum, so no explicit mass terms are needed in the Lagrangian for these dynamically generated masses. The quantum of the Higgs field, the Higgs boson, was discovered at the LHC in 2012, as described elsewhere in this volume. After this discovery Englert and Higgs were awarded the Nobel prize in 2013. The second problem was solved by \"renormalizing\" the divergent masses and couplings to observable quantities. In this way the electroweak theory becomes a \"renormalizable\" theory, as proven by 't Hooft and Veltman in the years 1971-1974. 6 This worked well, as demonstrated by the excellent agreement between the calculated and observed radiative corrections, leading to correct predictions for the top quark -and Higgs boson mass from the electroweak precision experiments at the LEP collider at CERN.

            "text": "How does this contribution fit into this picture? First I will discuss the electroweak precision experiments at LEP, which tested the quantum structure of the SM in great detail. A second topic has to do with physics beyond the SM. The SM is based on the product of the SU (3)xSU (2)xU(1) symmetry groups, so a natural question is: why three groups? And why can we not unify these groups into a larger group, like SU (5), having the SM groups as subgroups [7][8][9] ? The consequences are dramatic: since each SU(n) group is predicted to have n 2 -1 gauge bosons, it doubles the number of gauge bosons (12 in the SM; 24 in SU(5)). In SU(5) the leptons from SU (2) and quarks from SU (3) are contained in the same multiplet, which leads automatically to new lepton-and baryon number violating interactions between leptons and quarks. This inevitably leads to the proton decaying into leptons and quarks via the interactions with the new gauge bosons. In the standard SU(5) the proton lifetime was estimated to be of the order of 10 31 years. 8 The experimental limits a are two orders of magnitude above this prediction, 10,11 thus excluding grand unification in the SM, but not in the supersymmetric extension of the SM, which predicts a longer proton lifetime. 12 To explain the long proton lifetime in a unified theory, the new gauge bosons must be heavy. How heavy? Presumably these gauge bosons get a mass by the breaking of the SU(5) symmetry into the SU (3)xSU (2)xU(1) symmetry, just like the W and Z bosons get a mass by breaking of the SU (2)xU(1) symmetry into the U(1) symmetry. Above the SU (5) breaking scale one has a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with a single gauge coupling constant. Extrapolating the precisely measured gauge couplings at LEP to high energies showed that unification is excluded in the SM, but in the supersymmetric extension of the SM the gauge couplings unify and interestingly, at a scale consistent with the long proton lifetime. This result, estimating simultaneously the GUT scale and the scale of Supersymmetry from a fit to the gauge couplings, 13 became quickly on the top-ten citation list and was discussed in widely read scientific journals [14][15][16] and the daily press. Supersymmetry was developed in the early 70's as a unique extension of the rotational and translational symmetries of the Poincar\u00e9 group by a symmetry based on an internal quantum number, namely spin, see Ref. 17 for a historical review and original references. Supersymmetry requires an equal number of bosons and fermions, which can be realized only, if every fermion (boson) in the SM gets a supersymmetric bosonic (fermionic) partner. This doubles the particle spectrum, but the supersymmetric partners have not been observed so far, so if they exist, they must be heavier than the SM particles. Not only gauge coupling unification made Supersymmetry popular, since it removes several shortcomings of the SM as well. Especially it provides a dark matter candidate with the correct relic density, 18,19 see e.g. Refs [20][21][22][23] for reviews. On the other hand, the main shortcoming of Supersymmetry is the fact that none of the predicted supersymmetric partners of the SM particles have been observed, which could be a lack of luminosity or energy at the LHC, as will be discussed in the last section. And of course, other DM candidates exist as well. 24 ",

But it was clear, that precision experiments would need the clean environment of an e + e \u2212 collider. The CERN director, John Adams, who had just finished building the SPS, established in 1976 a study group a Since the background for proton decay experiments is provided by neutrinos, the discovery of different backgrounds for up-going and down-going neutrinos led to the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which implies neutrino masses.

A brief review of all the ups and downs on the way to reach a luminosity at LEP above its design value was given at the Topical Seminar on 'The legacy of LEP and SLC\" in Sienna in 2001. 29 This review on the LEP accelerator describes also the precise beam energy determination via spin depolarisation techniques, which can determine the beam energy to 0.2 MeV or a relative accuracy of 5 \u2022 10 \u22126 . In addition, the many surprises, like the correlation of the tides from the gravitational interaction between the moon and the earth or the amount of water in Lake Geneva with the beam energy, are described. These effects of a few MeV in the beam energy correspond to a change in the orbit length of a few mm, caused by the elasticity of the earth's crust. Also the short term energy fluctuations from the fast TGV train between Geneva and Paris, for which the LEP magnets turned out be a good current return path, were finally understood after these fluctuations were absent during a railway strike in France. The final uncertainty of about 2 MeV in the Z mass from the beam energy is considerably larger, mainly because the field of the dipole magnets varies with time. A schematic picture of the 27 km long LEP tunnel and its experiments is shown in Fig. 1, together with the joyful faces after the start of the operation in July, 1989.  After LEP started running the SLC made an amazing improvement by providing highly polarized beams, which are a sensitive probe of the weak interactions, in which left-and right-handed particles have different couplings. These data were largely collected by the SLD detector, which could determine the electroweak mixing angle with comparable precision in spite of the much smaller data sample of about half a million Z bosons (in comparison with 17 million events for the combined LEP experiments). At LEP a polarization scheme had been studied in great detail as well, 30 but finally it was discarded in favour of going to higher energies as quickly as possible.",

Also the 4-jet excess turned out to be a fluctuation, as was clear from the combined data of all experiments. 41 And last, but not least, in spite of the impressive data sample, in ratios involving leptonic decay modes, the statistical errors still dominate, so they profit from a factor two lower error after combining the data from the four experiments.

            "text": "\"A confrontation with infinity\" was the title of 't Hooft's Nobel Lecture. He showed that the high energy divergences in the SM can be tamed by renormalization techniques. Here one is subtracting in principle infinitely large numbers. The resulting answer is still reliable, as was proven by the electroweak precision measurements at LEP. To appreciate the significance of this result, I shortly describe the physical ideas behind the renormalization of masses and couplings. Take e.g. an electron. If it is a point-like particle, the potential energy in the electric field goes to infinity, if the distance goes to zero. In quantum language this would mean an infinite amount of photons. On short time scales they fluctuate into an infinite amount of e.g. e + e \u2212 pairs. The field energy and its e + e \u2212 pairs increase the mass of the electron, since energy implies mass according to Einsteins E = mc 2 . So the total mass can be written as the sum of two contributions: m = m bare + \u2206m, where m bare is the bare mass and \u2206m the contribution from the surrounding field, which becomes infinite as R \u2192 0. To get the mass in agreement with the observed mass, one has to let the bare mass go to minus infinity, i.e. one renormalizes the calculated mass to the observed mass. But this is not all: the virtual particles will orient themselves in the electric field, which causes a decrease of the electric field, just like the polarization of a dielectric material inside a capacitor decreases the electric field. This screening of the bare charge by the \"vacuum polarization\", leads to an energy dependence of the couping constants, since at high energies one looks at distances close to the bare charge, unshielded by the vacuum polarization.The calculated charge can again be renormalized to the observed charge at large distances, e.g. the fine structure constant in atomic physics or Thomson scattering at zero momentum transfer. The energy dependence of the coupling constant can be calculated from the loop diagrams of photons fluctuating into e + e \u2212 pairs, which can be described by the Renormalization Group Equations (RGE). 42 A heuristic derivation of the RGEs was given by 't Hooft's in his Nobel Lecture. 1 There he compares the use of differential equations in classical mechanics, like the movement of planets with the use of differential equations in quantum mechanics (QM). In classical mechanics one can calculate the speed of an object by v = \u2206x/\u2206t or as a differential equation v = dx/dt for small distances and times to get the most accurate speed. There is no problem with this. However, in QM one has to take into account the quantum fluctuations at small distances. One can check the precision of the solution by choosing different scales \u2206x in v(x) = \u2206x/\u2206t assuming one knows v(x). E.g. if we introduce a scale parametrized by a parameter 1/\u00b5 (where \u00b5 would be the energy in a quantum field theory) we find for",

A positive (negative) beta function means that the coupling increases (decreases) with energy. For QED the beta function is positive and the fine structure constant changes from 1/137.035999074 at low energy to 1/127.940 at LEP I energies. For QCD the beta function is negative, so the strong coupling constant decreases with energy. This decrease is the origin of asymptotic freedom, for which Politzer, Gross and Wilczek got the Nobel Prize in 2004. The physics behind asymptotic freedom is the fact that the gluons carry themselves color, so the gluons interact with themselves. This leads to an anti-screening of the bare color charge, so if the anti-screening is stronger than the screening by the quark pairs in the colour field, the interactions at high energy see only the bare colour charge, which is small and quarks are \"free\" at high energies. So the bare charge around an electron and quark is screened by fermion-antifermion pairs (light (yellow) in Fig. 2), but enhanced by gluons (dark (red)). Since the gluon selfinteraction prevents gluons to move off to infinity, the field lines between two colour charges are confined to a string between them in contrast to the electric field, in which case the field lines spread out to infinity. The energy density in the string becomes so high at large distances, that it is energetically favorable to convert the energy into mass by creating quark-antiquark pairs, which leads to the observation of jets of particles instead of bare quarks. The three jet events in e + e \u2212 annihilation at PETRA in 1979 heralded the discovery of the gluon as a real physical entity, produced by gluon radiation of quarks, see Ref. 43 for a review.",

For a massive gauge boson with mass m the propagator gets an additional factor k \u00b5 k \u03bd /m 2 .

The last term in Eq. 2 represents the propagator of a scalar particle for \u03bb = 1, i.e. in the Feynman or 't Hooft gauge. In this case the physics behind the compensation of the k \u00b5 k \u03bd /m 2 term is simple: the infinity in the amplitude of longitudinal W boson exchange is compensated by the exchange of a Higgs boson, so the calculated cross section will not pass the unitarity limit c . As 't Hooft noted in his Nobel lecture: 1 people knew that gauge boson masses can be generated by the Higgs mechanism, but they did not know that this was a unique solution, since at the same time it removes the infinities, thus making the theory renormalizable d . An important aspect of proving the renormalizability of the SM is a recipe how to handle technically the divergences. This was done most conveniently by dimensional regularisation, as discussed by 't Hooft and Veltman. 6 But what was of utmost importance for LEP: with such a renormalization scheme Veltman could calculate the radiative corrections from Higgs boson -and fermion loops to the weak gauge bosons, depicted in Fig 3a, and found surprisingly that the corrections depend quadratically on the top mass. 44 For the Higgs mass the quadratic term happens to have zero amplitude e , so only a logarithmic dependence is left. After electroweak symmetry breaking via the Higgs mechanism the mass eigenstates become linear combinations of the gauge bosons of the original (symmetric) Lagrangian (W i , i = 1, 2, 3 for SU(2) and B for U(1)):",

However, for quarks the asymmetries are larger for sin 2 \u03b8 W = 1/4, thus reducing the relative systematic errors. The weak mixing angle completely determines the branching fractions (g 2 V + g 2 A )/ tot , where the numerator is summed over the fermions considered and tot is the sum over all possible fermions. The branching fractions, calculated for x = sin 2 \u03b8 W = 0.2315, agree reasonably well with observations, as demonstrated in Table 1. The small discrepancies with the observed values originate from neglected fermion masses and mssing higher order radiative corrections, since only the dominant radiative correction at the b-vertex from the top loop (Eq. 6) has been taken into account.",

The electromagnetic calorimeters have typically a geometrical acceptance of | cos \u03b8| \u2264 0.7, the muon trackers typically | cos \u03b8| \u2264 0.9. For the hadronic final states the jets do not have a sharp angular edge for the acceptance, so the acceptance is limited by requiring a fraction of the total CM energy to be visible in the detector (typically 10%). Since the simulation programs of the Z decays and the detector simulation h are realistic inside the acceptance, the total efficiency can be extrapolated reliably to the full acceptance. Inside the acceptance the trigger efficiency is usually high, since events can be triggered by a multitude of signals, like track triggers, calorimetric triggers and combinations thereof. The selection efficiencies inside the acceptances are high, above 95% for electrons and muon pairs and 70 -90% for tau pair final states. The symmetric Breit-Wigner function can be described by the mass, the width and the peak height. The leptonic cross sections can be parametrized by the ratio of hadronic and leptonic widths: R 0 = \u0393 qq /\u0393 . Since lepton universality was compatible with all observations, we quote only results including lepton universality. The fitted values for these parameters from the various experiments and their combination are shown in Fig. 5. One observes that for the combined values of the experiments the common systematic errors are large in case of the hadronic final states, but for the leptonic final state the statistical error is still significant. The systematic errors on mass and width are dominated by the uncertainty of the LEP energy (around 2 MeV, as discussed in Section 2) and for the cross section by the luminosity error discussed above.",

This contour almost collapses into a line, because the precisely measured Higgs mass was included in the fit. Otherwise the line would have been a band in this plane, since higher Higgs boson masses would shift this line parallel to lower W masses. The direct measurements of M W and M t are bounded by the dark (blue) ellipse. These contours of the direct and indirect measurements (green (a) (b) Fig. 9. (a): Allowed 1\u03c3 contours with a probability of 39.35% in the M W versus Mt plane for the direct (dark (blue) ellipse) and indirect measurements (light (green)\"line\"). The dark (red) \"line\" is the 90% C.L. contour (\u2206\u03c7 2 = 4.605) allowed by all data. From Ref. 50 (b): Allowed 1\u03c3 contours with a probability of 39.35% in the M H versus Mt plane for various observables. The dark (red) ellipse corresponds to the 90% C.L. contour (\u2206\u03c7 2 = 4.605) from a global fit to all data. From Ref. 50 and blue) correspond to 1\u03c3 with a probability of 39%. Combining the direct and indirect measurements leads to the dark (red) \"line\", for which \u2206\u03c7 2 = 4.61 or a probability of 90% was chosen. The value of the directly measured M W mass is 1.5\u03c3 above the SM prediction, 50 which implies some tension between M W and M H , since lower values of M H would shift the SM prediction upwards. This tension is also visible in Fig. 9b, which shows the allowed 1\u03c3 contours in the M H versus M t plane from various indirect measurements. The direct measurements are indicated by the horizontal and vertical lines. The error on the Higgs mass is not visible on this scale. The dark (red) ellipse corresponds to the 90% C.L. contour (\u2206\u03c7 2 = 4.605) from a global fit to all data. 50 The central value of the ellipse (indirect measurements) is slightly below the direct measurement of the Higgs boson mass, since the slightly high value of M W pulls the Higgs mass to lower values. Although the indirectly measured Higgs mass is not precise, it indicated for the first time that a Higgs boson is needed with a mass around the electroweak scale, a value predicted by SUSY. 32 In the SM the Higgs boson mass is not predicted. 68 ",

As mentioned in Sect. 5 the Higgs exchange is needed to compensate the divergences from the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons. One can indeed verify by explicit calculations that the amplitudes cancel at high energies, i.e. A \u03bd + A \u03b3 + A Z =-A H . However, the Higgs exchange is proportional to m e \u221a s/M 2 W , so this term becomes (a) (b) only important for \u221a s \u2248 M 2 W /m e \u2248 10 7 GeV. At LEP II energies the longitudinal cross section can be neglected and only A \u03b3 , A \u03bd and A Z are important. Each of them increases with the energy squared, but A Z interferes negatively with the other amplitudes. The energy dependence of A \u03bd , A \u03bd +A \u03b3 and the total cross section are displayed in Fig. 10a. The negative interference leads to a rather slow energy dependence of the total W pair production cross section by virtue of the fact that the triple gauge boson vertex in A Z has the same gauge coupling as the coupling to fermions, a feature imposed by the gauge invariance of the SM. One observes excellent agreement between the SM prediction and data. The shape of the cross section in Fig. 10a is sensitive to M W . Combining this shape with invariant mass distributions of W final states leads to: M W = 80.376 \u00b1 0.033 GeV and \u0393 W = 2.195 \u00b1 0.083 GeV, 53 which agrees with mass measurements at the Tevatron, as shown in Fig.  10b. The world average of the directly measured W masses (M W = 80.385 \u00b1 0.015 GeV) is slightly higher than the indirectly measured W masses from the global electroweak fit (M W = 80.363 \u00b1 0.006 GeV), as shown before in Fig. 9a, but the discrepancy is only at the 1.5\u03c3 level, as discussed before.",

The hadronic peak cross section \u03c3 0 had can be determined either by normalizing to the luminosity or to the leptonic cross section. In the latter case one determines R 0 , the ratio of the hadronic and leptonic decay width of the Z boson. The different normalizations yield different values of the strong coupling constant: \u03b1 s = 0.1154 \u00b1 0.0040 and \u03b1 s = 0.1225 \u00b1 0.0037, if one uses \u03c3 0 had or R 0 , respectively. Here only M Z , \u0393 tot and \u03c3 0 had from all LEP experiments are used in the fit. 67 The low value obtained from the cross section normalized to the luminosity is correlated with the low value of the number of neutrino generations, determined as N \u03bd = 2.982(8), which is 2.3\u03c3 below the expected value of 3 neutrino generations. The error is dominated by the common theoretical error on the luminosity, as discussed before. In contrast, the ratio R 0 does not depend on the luminosity. If we require the number of neutrino generations to be three, this is most easily obtained by changing the common Bhabha cross section for all LEP experiments by 0.15% (3\u03c3), which leads to \u03b1 s = 0.1196\u00b10.0040, a value close to \u03b1 s = 0.1225\u00b10.0037 from R 0 and also close to the value from the ratio of the hadronic and leptonic widths of the \u03c4 lepton, R \u03c4 , which yields \u03b1 s = 0.1197 \u00b1 0.0016. 50 These \u03b1 s values are slightly above the world average of \u03b1 s = 0.1185 \u00b1 0.0006, quoted in the Partice Data Book. However, this value is dominated by the lattice calculations, for which the correlations between the different groups were not taken into account. Instead, only the weighted average was taken, implying that the groups estimating the systematic error from the \"window\" problem conservatively, 82 have a small weight. The window problem is, stated simply, the problem of transferring the strong coupling from the non-perturbative regime of fitted quark masses, as used in lattice calculations, to the M S scheme, which relies on a perturbative expansion. If one would take the spread in the values from the different lattice calculations as a window for the correct values, as is done in the \u03b1 s determination from the \u03c4 -data, the error would be a factor three larger, implying consistency between all measurements.",

If second order effects are included, one has to consider the interactions between Yukawa and gauge couplings as well as the running of the SUSY-and Higgs masses, which leads to a set of coupled differential equations. They can be solved numerically, see Ref. 21 for a compilation of the many RGEs and references therein. However, the second order effects are small and in first order the running of the coupling constants as function of the energy scale Q is proportional to 1/\u03b2 log(Q 2 ), so the inverse of the coupling constant versus log(Q 2 ) is a straight line with a slope given by the \u03b2 coefficient of the RGE. The fine structure constant is calculated from the RGE to change from 1/137.035999074 at low energy to 1/(127.940 \u00b1 0.014) at LEP I energies, which agrees with data, as shown in Fig. 12a. 75 Also the running of the strong coupling constant agrees with data, as shown in Fig. 12b. 50 One can obtain the gauge couplings at the Z scale from \u03b1 1 = (5/3)g 2 /(4\u03c0) = 5\u03b1/(3 cos 2 \u03b8 W ), \u03b1 2 = g 2 /(4\u03c0) = \u03b1/ sin 2 \u03b8 W , \u03b1 3 = g 2 s /(4\u03c0), where g , g and g s are the U (1), SU (2) and SU (3) coupling constants k . The connection between the first two couplings and the electroweak mixing angle can be obtained from Fig. 3b. The factor 5/3 in the definition of \u03b1 1 is needed for the proper normalization of the gauge groups, whose operators are required to be represented by traceless matrices, see e.g. Ref. 21  Fig.  13a demonstrates that the gauge coupling constants do not meet in a single point, at least of the RGEs from the SM are used l . However, the running of the couplings k The couplings are usually given in the M S scheme. However, for SUSY the dimensional reduction DR scheme is more appropriate. 83 It has the advantage that the three gauge couplings meet exactly at one point.

Allowing the SUSY mass scale and GUT scale to be free parameters in a fit requiring unification allows to derive these scales and their uncertainties. 13 Perfect unification is possible at a scale above 10 16 GeV, which is consistent with the lower limits on the proton lifetime, as shown in Fig. 13b, in agreement with unification results from other groups. 67,[85][86][87][88][89][90] Such a unification is by no means trivial, even from the naive argument, that two lines always meet, so three lines can always brought to a single meeting point with one additional free parameter, like the SUSY mass scale. However, since new mass scales effect all three couplings simultaneously, unification is only reached in rare cases. 91 E.g. a fourth family with an arbitrary mass scale changes all slopes by the same amount, thus never leading to unification. The SUSY mass scale depends on the values of the couplings at the Z scale, as can be seen from the minima of the \u03c7 2 distributions in Fig. 14a for slightly different couplings leading to variations in the SUSY scale from 0.5 to 3.5 TeV. Hence, the values of \u03b1 s , sin 2 \u03b8 W and M SU SY are correlated. The combination of these three and they lead more easily to unification. From Ref. 67 parameters yielding perfect unification are indicated by the diagonal lines for given values of M SU SY in the \u03b1 s , sin 2 \u03b8 W plane in Fig. 14b. 67 Here the full second order RGEs were used with step functions in the beta coefficient at the threshold for each SUSY particle using the particle spectrum from the constrained minimal supersymmetric model (CMSSM), which assumes equal masses m 0 (m 1/2 ) for the spin 0 (1/2) particles at the GUT scale. Low energy mass differences originate from the running of the masses from the GUT scale to the low energy scale, taken to be the mass of the SUSY particle. The horizontal bands indicate the value of sin 2 \u03b8 W from A 0,b F B and A LR . For sin 2 \u03b8 W from A LR no unification is possible with the central value of \u03b1 s . However, this of sin 2 \u03b8 W value is inconsistent with the value of sin 2 \u03b8 W from A 0,b F B at the 3\u03c3 level (Sect.8). With sin 2 \u03b8 W from A 0,b F B unification is possible for \u03b1 s \u2248 0.12 and M SU SY >1T eV . These values are consistent with the \u03b1 s value from observables not depending on the luminosity, (R 0 and R \u03c4 indicated by the shaded vertical band in Fig. 14b) and present limits on M SU SY from LHC. Clearly, new data from a future Z-factory would be highly welcome to settle the minor, but important discrepancies in \u03b1 s and sin 2 \u03b8 W displayed in Fig. 14b.",

Not only the masses of the top quark and Higgs boson mass could be inferred from the quantum corrections, but also a possible hint for the SM being part of a Grand Unified Theory was obtained from the running of the gauge couplings in case the symmetries of the SM are extended by another symmetry, namely Supersymmetry. Supersymmetry solves several shortcomings of the SM (see e.g. Refs 20-23 for reviews): i) Electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) does not need to be introduced ad hoc, but is induced via radiative corrections; ii) EWSB predicts a SM-like Higgs boson mass below 130 GeV; iii) EWSB explains the large difference between the GUT and electroweak scale, because of the slow running of the Higgs mass terms from positive to negative values; iv) EWSB requires the top quark mass to be between 140 and 190 GeV for a correct running of these Higgs mass terms; v) The quadratic divergences in the loop corrections of the SM disappear in Supersymmetry, because of the cancellations between an equal number of fermions and bosons in the loops; vi) The mass ratio of bottom quark over tau lepton is predicted in SUSY, if one presumes Yukawa coupling unification at the GUT scale; vii) The lightest SUSY particle is a perfect DM candidate, since it is expected to be stable with a self-annihilation cross section of the right order of magnitude to provide the correct relic density.",

However, as shown in Fig. 14a, gauge unification for SUSY masses up to several TeV is perfectly possible. Also the argument that for heavier SUSY masses the cancellation of the quadratic divergences is impacted, is only qualitative. Anyway, the squarks and gluinos are expected to be the heaviest particles because of the gluon clouds surrounding them, so the gauginos and additional Higgs particles may be considerably lighter. These have only weak production cross sections at the LHC, so we do not have the sensitivity, even if the energy might be sufficient. E.g. for the associated WZ production in the 3-lepton channel the LHC has typically produced 2500 events per experiment for the present luminosity of abour 20/fb at 8 TeV. Assuming the SUSY partners to be a factor four heavier reduces the cross section roughly by a factor 1/M 4 or more than two orders of magnitude, bringing them to the edge of discovery. Even at the full LHC energy and an integrated luminosity of 3000/fb the discovery reach for charginos will only be 800 GeV. 92 This integrated luminosity can be reached around 2030, but of course, nothing may be found, either because the SUSY particles are still heavier or Nature may have found ways different from Supersymmetry to circumvent the shortcomings of the SM.",
