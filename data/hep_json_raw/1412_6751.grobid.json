These final states have been useful in the past to determine properties of the D s1 (2536) and \u03c8(3770) mesons and of the X(3872) state at BABAR [2] and Belle [3,4] as well as the D * s1 (2700) + meson at Belle [4]. These analyses, based on the studies of invariant mass distributions, were able to extract properties such as the mass, width, and spin of the resonances.",

Charged particle identification is based on the measurements of the energy loss in the tracking devices and of the Cherenkov radiation in the ring-imaging detector. The energies and locations of showers associated with photons are measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The probability density function (PDF) of the signal is determined from Monte Carlo samples. A Crystal Ball function [17] (Gaussian PDF modified to include a power-law tail on the low side of the peak) is used to describe the signal. The background contribution is the sum of cross-feed events and combinatorial background. The cross-feed background to a mode consists of all incorrectly reconstructed B \u2192 D ( * ) D ( * ) K events. The ratio of cross-feed events to signal events is 11% for B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 D 0 K + and 17% for B + \u2192 D 0 D 0 K + . The cross-feed events are described by the sum of an AR-GUS function [18] and a Gaussian function, where the latter allows us to take into account the cross-feed events peaking in the signal region. For both modes, the Gaussian part represents a negligible contribution to the total cross feed. Since the fit for the yield for one channel uses as input the branching fractions from other channels, an iterative procedure using the 22 B \u2192 D ( * ) D ( * ) K modes is employed [15]. The combinatorial background events are described by the sum of an ARGUS function and a Gaussian function, reflecting the fact that a small fraction of events peaks in the signal region (coming for example from DD 0 K + events where one of the D mesons is not decaying to a studied mode). The fits performed on the m ES distributions using the sum of the PDFs for the signal and for the background are shown in Fig. 1. We obtain 635 \u00b1 47 and 901 \u00b1 54 signal events for [15].",

The signal contribution is extracted from the fit, and plotted as a function of mass to obtain a background subtracted D 0 K + invariant mass distribution. The second method is based on the use of the sPlot technique [22], which allows the subtraction of the background in the invariant mass distribution using other uncorrelated variables so that the signal is kept with the correct statistical significance for the variable to be plotted. The sPlot technique uses the results of the m ES fit described in Sec. III (yields and covariance matrix) and the PDFs of this fit to compute an event-by-event weight for the signal and background categories. We obtain a D 0 K + invariant mass distribution free of background by applying the sPlot weight to each event. Using these two methods of background subtraction, we observe that the enhancement at low mass is present in the D 0 K + invariant mass distributions for both modes, proving that it originates from B \u2192 DD 0 K + final states.",

For B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 D 0 K + , we observe that the majority of the fits (60%) converge to the exact same values of the set of fitted parameters, which we choose as our nominal fit. However a proportion of fits (23%) converges to a slightly lower value of F with a sum of fit fractions (Eq. (8)) greater than 250%. This large sum of fractions, which is unlikely to be physical, originates from large interference between the nonresonant and the exponential contributions, which are both ad hoc amplitudes. These fits return values of the parameter related to the resonances very close to those of the nominal fit: these differences are taken into account in the calculation of the systematic uncertainties. Moreover, we find a local minimum for 3% of the fits with \u2206F = 1, which we account for in the systematic uncertainties. We observe that 5% of the fits have \u2206F > 20. For B + \u2192 D 0 D 0 K + , one third of the 250 fits converge to the global minimum, chosen as our nominal fit.

            "text": "Several systematic uncertainties arise from the fit modeling. The first one comes from the Blatt-Weisskopf bar-rier, which is not known precisely. Fits of both modes with this value as a free parameter show that the analysis is not sensitive to it. To estimate the related systematic uncertainty, we repeat the analysis changing the value of the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier radius from the nominal value 1.5 GeV \u22121 to 5 GeV \u22121 and 0 GeV \u22121 . The differences for each parameter between the nominal fit and these fits give the systematic uncertainties (labeled as \"BW\" in the tables). Another systematic uncertainty originates from the description of the low-mass excess. Since this effect is not understood in the current data, it is important to estimate the possible influence it induces on the fit parameters, especially the mass and the width of the D * s1 (2700) + meson. To compute the systematic uncertainties associated with this effect, we assume first that the excess originates from a scalar resonance at low mass: we repeat the fits replacing the exponential contribution by a scalar resonance with a mass and a width free to float. Second, instead of the exponential function, we use an alternative model, A Alt = 1 1+a\u00d7(m 2 2 \u2212m 2 2 thr ) with a a free parameter. The maximum deviations with respect to the nominal fit for each of these two alternatives are used as the systematic uncertainties (column \"Low mass\"). We then study the influence of the resonances on the analyses. Since the D * s2 (2573) + amplitude presents a low fit fraction, we repeat the fits without this amplitude and take the difference as a systematic uncertainty (column \"D * s2 \"). The effect of the spin-1 D * sJ (2860) + has TABLE II. Systematic uncertainties for B + \u2192 D 0 D 0 K + in the moduli, in the phases ( \u2022 ), in the fractions (%), in the mass (MeV/c 2 ) and the width (MeV) of the D * s1 (2700) + , and in \u03b1, the parameter of the exponential function. The labels refer to systematic uncertainties related to the fit bias (\"Bias\"), efficiency interpolation (\"Eff.\"), statistical uncertainty in efficiency (\"Eff. II\"), background knowledge (\"Bkg\"), Blatt-Weisskopf barrier (\"BW\"), low-mass description (\"Low mass\"), D * s2 (2573) + amplitude (\"D * s2 \"), \u03c8(3770) amplitude (\"\u03c8\"), and other minima (\"Min.\"). The sign '-' means that no systematic uncertainty has been attributed to the specific parameter.  also been investigated: because the fits return negligible fractions for this state, the systematic uncertainties on the other parameters are found to be negligible. For B + \u2192 D 0 D 0 K + , another systematic uncertainty (column \"\u03c8\") arises from the \u03c8(3770) parameters fixed to the world average value [16]. As an alternative, we use the measurement from the KEDR experiment [24]. This experiment reports a result which takes into account the resonance-continuum interference in the near-threshold region and which agrees well with previous BABAR measurements [2,25].",
