We set upper limits on the production cross section of such a resonance multiplied by its branching fraction to tt. We exclude a leptophobic topcolor Z \u2032 at the 95% confidence level for masses below 835 GeV (940 GeV) if its width is 1.2% (3%) of its mass. We also exclude color octet vector bosons (colorons) with masses below 775 GeV. Narrow resonances that decay to top-antitop quark (tt) pairs are predicted by many models of physics beyond the standard model. Such resonances (X) appear in grand unified theories with symmetry groups larger than SU(5) [1], as Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon or of the Z boson that predominantly decay to tt pairs [2,3], as axigluons [4], and in theories of new strong dynam- * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c UPIITA-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, d SLAC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, e University College London, London, UK, f Centro de Investigacion en Computacion -IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, g ECFM, Universidad Autonoma de Sinaloa, Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico, and h Universit\u00e4t Bern, Bern, Switzerland. \u2021 Deceased.",

To simplify comparisons with previous limits, we include the same model as a reference.

We discriminate between continuum and resonant tt production using the invariant mass of the tt system.

We fix the relative normalization of the Z + bb, Z + cc, and Z+light parton samples and the relative normalizations of the W + bb, W + cc, and W +light parton samples to NLO predictions computed with mcfm [23]. We then normalize the inclusive Z boson production such that \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z) \u00d7 B(Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) agrees with the NNLO prediction of 256 pb [24].

For each hypothesis we also vary the systematic uncertainties given in Table I subject to a Gaussian constraint to their prior values to maximize the likelihood [25]. We then use the profile likelihood ratio L = \u22122 ln(P s+b /P b ) as the test statistic, where P s+b is the Poisson likelihood to observe the data under the signal+background hypothesis and P b is the Poisson likelihood to observe the data under the background-only hypothesis. For the background-only hypothesis, we fit three components to the data. We constrain the tt production to its theoretical cross section, and the multijets background to the predicted number of events. For the other backgrounds, we constrain the relative fractions of the individual background sources to their predicted values and treat the overall normalization as a free parameter. For the signal+background fit we add \u03c3B for the resonance as a parameter to the fit.",

Using pseudoexperiments, we determine the probability to measure values of L that are larger than the value observed in the data sample if there is a tt resonance signal, CL s+b , and if there is no such signal, CL b . The value of \u03c3B for which 1 \u2212 CL s+b /CL b = 0.95 is the 95% C.L. upper limit. We repeat this procedure at every resonance mass value. Table I summarizes the sources of systematic uncertainties in the normalizations of the components of the model used in the limit calculation. No uncertainties are given for the physics backgrounds other than tt production because their normalizations are free parameters of the fit. When estimating the effect of uncertainties in the jet energy scale, the jet identification efficiency, and the jet energy resolution, we vary the shape of the m tt distributions. We also assign an uncertainty to the shape of the m tt distribution from tt production equal to the difference between the default simulation using alpgen and pythia and a simulation using mc@nlo and herwig. We also considered variations in the amount of initial and final state radiation but concluded that the resulting changes in the m tt distribution were negligible relative to the uncertainties that we already consider. Figure 2 shows the distribution of m tt observed in data compared to expectations from standard model backgrounds and a 950 GeV tt resonance. We observe a small excess of events at high mass values. The excess is present in both the e+jets data and the \u00b5+jets data. We can fit the data best with an additional resonance signal with a mass of 950 GeV and \u03c3B = 0.10 \u00b1 0.05 pb. The value of 1 \u2212 CL b for the data gives the probability of getting a deviation of at least the observed size at this mass value from the standard model expectation in the absence of physics beyond the standard model. We find a p value of 0.018, corresponding to 2.1 Gaussian-equivalent standard deviations. This significance value does not take into account that the excess may have occurred at any place in the mass spectrum. Figure 3 and Table II display the resulting limits for \u03c3B compared to the limits expected in the absence of a narrow tt resonance. Superimposed on the cross section limits are predictions for \u03c3B of topcolor Z \u2032 bosons [6] with \u0393 X = 0.012M X (0.03M X ) that exclusively decay to tt. The expected mass limits for such Z \u2032 bosons are  below 835 (940) GeV. We also superimpose the predicted \u03c3B for a color octet vector boson (coloron), which would decay to tt with a branching fraction of about 1/6 and have a width substantially below 1% of its mass. We include two curves, for different values of the coupling to light quarks r = 0.1 and 0.2 [27]. This could for example be a Kaluza-Klein gluon. We can exclude such a coloron for r = 0.2 with masses below 775 GeV. In our previous publication [7], we computed a Bayesian limit on \u03c3B for a tt resonance. For reference, we have repeated the same calculation using a subset of the data sample reported in this paper, corresponding to 4.3 fb \u22121 , and find results consistent with the limits on \u03c3B given in Fig. 3. We also find that our results are independent of the couplings of the tt resonance (pure vector, pure axial-vector, or standard-model Z-like) and are therefore valid for any narrow resonance that decays to a tt final state.",
