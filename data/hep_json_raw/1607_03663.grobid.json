They are parameterized as a function of offset energy density \u03c1, jet area A, jet pseudorapidity \u03b7, and jet transverse momentum p T . Corrections for residual differences between data and detector simulation as a function of \u03b7 are determined using the random cone (RC, section 4.3) method in zero-bias events (section 3.2). The pileup offset corrections are determined both before and after CHS, which removes tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices. The simulated jet response corrections are determined with a CMS detector simulation based on G 4 [18] combined with the 6.4 [19] tune Z2* [20], as discussed in section 5. The corrections are determined for various jet sizes. The default corrections are provided for the QCD dijet flavor mixture as a function of p T and \u03b7. Uncertainties arising from the modeling of jet fragmentation are evaluated with ++ 2.3 [21] tune EE3C [22], and uncertainties from the detector simulation are evaluated with the CMS fast simulation [23].",

The corrections as a function of pseudorapidity \u03b7 and transverse momentum p T are extracted from data and simulated events combining several channels and methods. They account successively for the effects of pileup, uniformity of the detector response, and residual data-simulation jet energy scale differences. Further corrections, depending on the jet flavor and distance parameter (jet size) R, are also presented. The jet energy resolution is measured in data and simulated events and is studied as a function of pileup, jet size, and jet flavor. Typical jet energy resolutions at the central rapidities are 15-20% at 30 GeV, about 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV. The studies exploit events with dijet topology, as well as photon+jet, Z+jet and multijet events. Several new techniques are used to account for the various sources of jet energy scale corrections, and a full set of uncertainties, and their correlations, are provided.The final uncertainties on the jet energy scale are below 3% across the phase space considered by most analyses (p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 5.0). In the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.3) an uncertainty below 1% for p T > 30 GeV is reached, when excluding the jet flavor uncertainties, which are provided separately for different jet flavors. A new benchmark for jet energy scale determination at hadron colliders is achieved with 0.32% uncertainty for jets with p T of the order of 165-330 GeV, and |\u03b7| < 0.8.",

Jets are the experimental signatures of energetic quarks and gluons produced in high-energy processes. Like all experimentally-reconstructed objects, jets need to be calibrated in order to have the correct energy scale: this is the aim of the jet energy corrections (JEC). The detailed understanding of both the energy scale and the transverse momentum resolution of the jets is of crucial importance for many physics analyses, and a leading component of their associated systematic uncertainties. Improvements made in understanding the JES in the recent years have resulted in very precise measurements of, e.g., the inclusive jet cross section [1][2][3][4][5], and the top quark mass [6][7][8][9]. The JES uncertainties presented here propagate to uncertainties of 2-4% in the jet cross sections in the central region, and of \u00b10.35 GeV in the top-quark mass determination. The results in this paper are reported for jets reconstructed with the particle-flow (PF) method [10,11] using the anti-k T algorithm [12] with distance parameter R = 0.5. The jet energy corrections are calculated using a detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the detector, and are then adjusted for data using a combination of several channels and data-driven methods. The JEC successively correct for the offset energy coming from multiple proton-proton collisions in the same and adjacent beam crossings (pileup), the detector response to hadrons, and residual differences between data and MC simulation as a function of the jet pseudorapidity \u03b7 and transverse momentum p T . The jet p T is corrected up to the so-called particle-level jets clustered from stable (decay length c\u03c4 > 1 cm) and visible (excluding neutrinos) final-state particles.",

The lifetime of heavy hadrons (containing c and b quarks) is shorter than c\u03c4 = 1 cm, so their decay products are the particles considered for jet clustering. The exclusion of neutrinos is a convention adopted by CMS, but it is not universally adopted by all experiments in high-energy physics. Indeed, neutrinos are often included at the particle level, but the response is measured from samples with negligible neutrino content, leading to practically no difference for inclusive JEC. The CMS convention allows us to define response in a way that is experimentally accessible and significantly reduces response differences between heavyflavor (c, b) and light-quark (u, d, s) or gluon jets, caused by neutrinos produced in semileptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons. It should be noted that the neutrino fraction leads to an additional systematic uncertainty in the heavy hadrons fragmentation relative to the original b and c quarks that is not included in JEC systematics, but should be considered in, e.g., measurements of the inclusive b-jet cross section or of the top quark mass.

When the jet clustering is run on the event, the hard particles in the event are clustered together with such ghosts: a few jets will contain high-momentum particles from the hard-scattering interaction, but most of the jets will be entirely made of ghosts, for which the main real energy contributions come from detector noise and especially pileup. The offset energy density \u03c1 is defined, in each event, as the median of jet momenta p T,i divided by their area [38]. For this calculation, no selection on the jet momenta is applied. Using the median instead of the mean makes \u03c1 effectively insensitive to hard jets in the event, and including zero-energy jets composed of only ghost particles reduces bias for low pileup energy densities. For Run 2, a simpler approach is used to calculate \u03c1, which is evaluated as the median of the energies calculated in a grid of \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 cells, and does not make use of jet clustering anymore.",

The pileup offset corrections have been relatively stable over time at 7 TeV in 2010 and 2011, when scaled to similar pileup conditions.

The CMS calorimeters have been calibrated in test beam studies, and the single-pion response (SPR) has subsequently been checked on proton-proton data with charged pions [47], confirming good modeling of the barrel response in simulation to within \u00b13%. Because the PF reconstruction relies heavily on tracking for low-p T jets, the sensitivity to the detector calibration is strongly reduced compared to the calorimeter-only reconstruction. To show this effect, the ratio of the response when varying the SPR with respect to the nominal response is shown in figure 12, for jets reconstructed with the PF algorithm and for jets reconstructed with only calorimetric energy deposits, both using the anti-k T algorithm. For this study, the SPR has been propagated to the JEC using the CMS fast simulation. At low p T , PF is directly sensitive to SPR only through neutral hadrons, which on average contribute 15% of the jet energy at particle level, leading to a sensitivity of about 0.5% for a simultaneous change of \u00b13% in both ECAL and HCAL SPR. At high p T the PF performance approaches that of the calorimetric reconstruction, because the tracking efficiency drops in the dense jet core and the leading tracks become too straight for a reliable p T measurement. Since 25% of the jet energy is deposited as photons (section 10), the JEC sensitivity to a \u00b13% change in SPR is at most 2.3%. The sensitivity to changes in SPR has been also studied separately for a 3% change in the response of the ECAL and HCAL, as shown in figure 13. The results are qualitatively similar to an overall change in SPR, but show larger sensitivity to the SPR in HCAL at high p T . This is because hadronic showers become deeper for high-p T particles, and deposit a larger fraction of their energy in the HCAL.",

This is compatible with the magnitude and sign of the observed difference of less than 2% between MPF and p T balance at the \u03b1 \u2192 0 limit in figure 19.",

The relative statistical power (quantified by the relative resolution of the measured response, compared to the particle-level response) of p T balance and MPF depends on the jet p T and the level of PU, as seen in figure 20. The MPF method is sensitive to smearing in p miss T caused by PU, while the p T balance is sensitive to the smearing in the momentum balance caused by ISR+FSR. The former effect dominates at low p T , while the latter dominates at high p T , such that both methods have similar sensitivity at p T \u2248 100 GeV for \u00b5 = 20.",

The differences between Z(\u2192 ee)+jet and Z(\u2192 \u00b5\u00b5)+jet/\u03b3+jet events in the MPF method are due to a double counting of leakage from PF electrons and photons to p miss T (EM footprint effect on p miss T ), which is absent for muons and corrected for photons, but not for electrons. The differences between the MPF and the p T -balance methods arise from ISR+FSR effects, and largely disappear in the data/MC ratio when k FSR corrections are applied.

As a reminder, the CMS definition of jet energy response R excludes neutrinos, which would otherwise lower b and c jet response significantly. The jets from strange quarks also have relatively low response due to the high probability of producing long-lived strange neutral hadrons (mainly K 0 L ) with significant p T . This effect is specific to PF jets, which have a larger difference between charged and neutral hadron responses than calorimeter jets.",

Figure 28. Jet-flavor fractions in the physics (Ph) and algorithmic (Al) flavor definitions for QCD dijet (left), Z+jet (middle), and \u03b3+jet (right) samples. As explained in section 6, the variable \u03b1 = p T, 3rd jet /p T,ave for dijet events and \u03b1 = p T, 2nd jet /p T,\u03b3/Z for Z+jet and \u03b3+jet events. Flavor (physics definition)  ences between 6.4 and ++ 2.3 are observed for the gluon jets. The response is higher than unity for all flavors, since Z+jet events have lower contributions from the underlying event than dijet events, leading to a small bias from the hybrid jet area method, defined in section 4.3. Moreover, as shown in figure 28, Z+jet events have a smaller gluon fraction (25% for p T = 60 GeV) with respect to dijet (65% for p T = 60 GeV) events, and the different response of gluons and light-quark jets, visible in figure 30 (right), raises the average response for Z+jet events. Figure 29 (right) demonstrates the simulated jet composition for different jet flavors. The s-quark jets have higher neutral hadron fractions due to K 0 L production, while the neutrino production in c and b jets is evident through the associated muons and electrons. The softer fragmentation of gluon jets has relatively little impact on the particle composition, but results in low effective response for the neutral hadrons R nh .",

The relative behavior of the differences has a weak dependence on p T , but the absolute differences become smaller at high p T . This can be explained by the asymptotic rise of the neutral hadron response towards unity at high p T and detector acceptance effects becoming less significant for high-p T jets. While 6.4 and ++ 2.3 agree well on quark flavor response, there are significant differences in the gluon response modeling. A useful metric for the JES sensitivity to flavor response modeling is the difference in light-quark (uds) and gluon jet response, shown in figure 30 (right). The flavor sensitivity of the CMS PF algorithm is much reduced with respect to the CALO jets reconstruction, as was demonstrated in ref. [13].",

The flavor uncertainties are assigned based on 6.4 and ++ 2.3 differences, which are propagated through the data-based calibration chain with dijet, photon+jet, and Z+jet events. As a result, the flavor uncertainties are minimized for these flavor mixtures. The flavor differences in 6.4 and ++ 2.3 are largest for gluon jets, while the two MC simulations agree well on both lightand heavy-quark jets.",
