            "text": "The production rates of b and b hadrons in pp collisions are not expected to be identical. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as the production asymmetry, is related to the fact that there can be coalescence between a perturbatively produced b or b quark and the u and d valence quarks in the beam remnant. Therefore, one can expect a slight excess in the production of B + and B 0 mesons with respect to B \u2212 and B 0 mesons, and e.g. of \u039b 0 b baryons with respect to \u039b 0 b baryons. As b and b quarks are almost entirely produced in pairs via strong interactions, the existence of B + and B 0 production asymmetries must be compensated by opposite production asymmetries for other B-meson and b-baryon species. These asymmetries are roughly estimated to be at the 1% level for pp collisions at LHC energies, and are expected to be enhanced at forward rapidities and small transverse momenta. Other subtle effects of quantum chromodynamics, beyond the coalescence between beauty quarks and light valence quarks, may also contribute [1][2][3].",

The bachelor pion must be selected without introducing biases on the decay time, hence only requirements on momentum and transverse momentum are applied, avoiding the use of impact parameter variables. The decay time distribution of these fake B candidates yields an estimate of the decay time resolution of a real decay. In order to validate the method, simulated events are used for both signals and fake B decays. The resolution is found to be overestimated by about 4 fs. This difference is taken into account as a systematic effect. The simulation also indicates that a dependence of the resolution on the decay time must be considered. Taking this into account, an average decay time resolution of 49 \u00b1 8 fs is estimated. A resolution model, R(t), consisting of a triple Gaussian function with zero mean and three different widths, characterized by an average width of 49 fs, is used. The uncertainty of 8 fs on the average width is taken into account as a systematic uncertainty. It is estimated from simulation that the measurement of the decay time is biased by no more than 2 fs, and the effect is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty.",

To account for the dependence of the production asymmetries on the kinematics of the B 0 and B 0 s mesons, each data sample must be divided into bins of (p T , \u03b7), performing the same fit for each bin. In order to validate the fit model, a series of fits to the distributions of events obtained from fast simulations is used to verify the accuracy of the central values and the reliability of the uncertainties. No evidence of biases on central values nor of uncertainty misestimations is found. Furthermore, a global fit to the total sample of selected events is performed for each of the three decay modes. According to Eq. (3), for small values of A CP and A f , to first order the decay rate is only sensitive to the sum of these two quantities. For this reason, we fix A CP to zero and leave A f as a free parameter in the fits. It is empirically verified that the choice of different A CP values, up to the few percent level, leads to negligible variations of A P , as expected. Fig. 1 shows the J /\u03c8 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant mass and decay time distributions, with the results of the global fits overlaid. Fig. 2 shows the raw asymmetries, defined as the ratios between the difference and the sum of the overall decay time distributions, as a function of decay time for candidates in the signal mass region. The signal yields, A P values and detection asymmetries obtained from the global fits are reported in Table 2.

The measurements have been performed in bins of p T and \u03b7, and provide constraints that can be used to test different models of B-meson production. Furthermore, once integrated using appropriate weights for any reconstructed B 0 (s) decay mode, they can be used to derive effective production asymmetries, as inputs for CP violation measurements with the LHCb detector.",

To estimate the contribution of each single source, we repeat the fit for each (p T , \u03b7) bin after having modified the baseline fit model. The shifts from the relevant baseline values are taken as the systematic uncertainties. To estimate a systematic uncertainty related to the parameterization of final state radiation effects on the signal mass distributions, the parameter s of Eq.(2)is varied by \u00b11\u03c3 of the corresponding value obtained from fits to simulated events. A systematic uncertainty related to the invariant mass resolution model is estimated by repeating the fit using a single Gaussian function. The systematic uncertainty related to the parameterization of the mass shape for the combinatorial background is investigated by replacing the exponential function with a straight line. Concerning the partially reconstructed background, we assess a systematic uncertainty by repeating the fits while excluding the low masssideband, i.e. applying the requirements m > 5.20 GeV/c 2 for the B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decays and m > 5.33 GeV/c 2 for B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decays. To estimate the uncertainty related to the parameterization of signal decay time acceptances, different acceptance functions are considered. Effects of inaccuracies in the knowledge of the decay time resolution are estimated by rescaling the widths of the baseline model to obtain an average resolution width differing by \u00b18 fs. Simulation studies also indicate that there is a small bias in the reconstructed decay time. The impact of such a bias is assessed by introducing a corresponding bias of \u00b12 fs in the decay time resolution model. The determination of the systematic uncertainties related to the |q/p| input value needs a special treatment, as A P is correlated with |q/p|. For this reason, any variation of |q/p| turns into the same shift of A P in each of the kinematic bins. Such a correlation is taken into account when averaging A P (B 0 ) measurements from B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * 0 and B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decays, or when integrating over p T and \u03b7. The values of the systematic uncertainties related to the knowledge of |q/p| are 0.0013 in the case of A P (B 0 ) and 0.0030 in the case of A P (B 0 s ). The dominant systematic uncertainties for the B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * 0 decay are related to the signal mass shape and to |q/p|. For the B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decay, the most relevant systematic uncertainties are related to the signal mass shape and to the partially reconstructed background. Systematic uncertainties associated with the decay time resolution and m s are the main sources for the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + decay.",
