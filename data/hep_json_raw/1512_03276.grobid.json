A non-zero transverse momentum, p T , is generated through the emission of partons in the initial state and therefore its measurement provides an important test of quantum chromo dynamic (QCD) calculations. Different approaches for the theoretical prediction of the p T spectra have been developed in recent years, using fixed-order calculations, parton shower models or resummed calculations, aiming for an accurate prediction of the low-p T and high-p T parts of the spectrum.",

Therefore, the measurement of p T (W ) relies on the so-called hadronic recoil, u. The hadronic recoil is defined per event as the vectorial sum of all measured transverse energies in the calorimeters except for the contribution from the decay leptons ( Figure 1). It can be interpreted as the energy stemming from the initial state radiation in the process pp \u2192 W + X, which gives rise to p T (W ). With an ideal detector, the vectorial sum of the measured hadronic recoil and the transverse momentum of the vector boson in the process must vanish, i.e. u + p T (W ) = 0. The fundamental quantity for the measurement of p T (W ) is therefore the hadronic recoil. Experimentally, u is a complex quantity with a poor energy resolution since it is based on a large number of low energetic calorimetric measurements and depends strongly on the number of pile-up (PU) collisions \u00b5 1 . A typical energy resolution of u for a W boson with a transverse momentum of 40 GeV at an LHC detector is \u223c 20% for \u00b5 = 5 and can rise to \u2248 35% and \u2248 45% for \u00b5 = 20 and \u00b5 = 40, respectively.",

This can usually be achieved by applying unfolding techniques, such as a Bayesian unfolding approach [2]. This technique is used to unfold the reconstructed distribution of | u| to the true distribution p T (W ) for selected events, taking into account bin-to-bin migration effects via a response matrix describing the probabilistic mapping from p T (W ) to | u|. This approach is typically chosen by high energy physics experiments to unfold kinematic distributions, e.g. [3]. It is important to note that the chosen binning of the response matrix is crucial for the stability of the unfolded results. A basic quantity here is the stability p, which defines the probability of an event to be reconstructed in the same bin as it was generated. Typically stability values above 60% lead to stable results of the unfolding procedure. Given the limited energy resolution of the hadronic recoil, rather large bin sizes have to be chosen for the unfolding of a p T (W ) spectrum. Examples are discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.",

For the following discussion it can be assumed that f V is flexible enough to describe any realistic transverse momentum distribution of vector bosons V = W, Z in hadron collisions using only up to three functional parameters a i and returns the probability for a given trans-verse momentum to be produced. The goal of measuring the truth p T (W ) distribution is now reduced to the determination of the functional parameters a i , using the measured | u| distribution. The starting point for the evaluation of the functional parameters is the predicted distribution of H(p M C T (W )) by a Monte Carlo Event generator, the corresponding reconstructed hadronic recoil distribution after the full detector simulation H(u M C ) and the actual measured hadronic recoil distribution H(u Data ), where H denotes the representation in form of a normalized histogram. In a second step, the function f V is fitted to H(p M C T (W )), resulting in initial parameters a i . For each variation of the parameters a i , the histogram H(p M C T (W )) and therefore also H(u M C ) can be reweighted on an event-byevent basis, such that H(p M C T (W )) corresponds to the new values of a i . This reweighting procedure therefore transfers the possible variations of the underlying truth spectra to the observable H(u M C ). The difference between the predicted H(u M C ) and the observed distribution H(u Data ) can be quantified by a simple \u03c7 2 definition, i.e.",

By using a multi-parameter minimization algorithm, such a Minuit [4], the parameters a i can be fitted such that the \u03c7 2 value (as difference between prediction and observation) is minimized. In this case we assume that the function f V , corresponding to the fitted parameters a i , describes the true spectrum of the vector boson. The advantage of this procedure lies in the fact, that the expected functional form of the transverse momentum distribution reduces the measurement problem to the determination of a few functional parameters by taking into account a detailed observed kinematic spectrum. This bypasses the restrictions due to bin purities as described in the traditional strategy. Clearly, this methodology is limited to which extent the function form f V is flexible enough to reassemble all possible realistic p T (W ) distributions. These limitations and the actual functional form of f V are discussed in the next section.",

The NNLO corrections dominate the high p T part of the vector boson spectrum, while the resummed NNLL calculations aim for a good description of the low p T part. These event generators typically provide a very accurate description of the measured Z boson transverse momenta, once their model parameters have been fitted to the available measurements. In principle, these event generators could serve as basis for a functional description f V , as discussed in Section 2. However, this would imply regenerat-ing an enormous number of events for each fitting step, which leads to computational times that are currently not yet reachable. Therefore, we propose a semi-empirical parametrization that relies on a number of simple arguments, first introduced in [8]. Consider a vector boson production at high energy, and at given mass and rapidity, so that the parton momentum fractions at the hard vertex are small and fixed. In the low transverse momentum region, the repeated gluon emission in the initial state generates a Gaussian transverse momentum distribution.

This is shown in Figure 4 for Equation 3.1, where we fit the measured p T (Z) distribution, provided by the ATLAS Experiment [3] at \u221a s = 7 TeV, and illustrate the accuracy envelope based on the MC samples of Table 1 in the ratio plot. Two things can be noted: First of all, the measured p T (Z) spectrum is far within the accuracy band of the functional description. This is not surprising, as the variety of MC predictions is very large, leading to a conservative estimate of the achievable accuracy. Secondly, even though the functional form given by Equation 3.1 describes the basic features of the vector boson momentum distribution correctly, it has problems describing the rising edge and the peak region.",

The corresponding accuracy envelope of this function with respect to the MC samples in Table 1 does not exceed a 2% deviation anywhere between 2 and 35 GeV of the vector boson transverse momentum. Fitting five parameters indirectly via a hadronic recoil spectrum leads to significant challenges during the minimization procedure 2 . However, it turned out that the two new parameters \u03c1 and \u03c4 are not independent from the first three parameters. In fact, the first additional parameter can be fixed to \u03c1 \u2248 0.84, while \u03c4 can be approximated by \u03c4 \u2248 (0.6 \u2022 \u03b1 2 \u2212 2.3 \u2022 \u03b1 \u2212 1.1)/1000, leading to a function with three free parameters.

The resulting accuracy band of Equation 3.2 including the parameter fixation for all MC predictions is shown in Figure 6, again also indicating the measured p T (Z) spectrum. The uncertainty band does not exceed a 3% deviation starting with p T larger than 5 GeV up to 40 GeV. Again, the measured spectrum lies within the predicted accuracy band. The dominating limitations on the accuracy are due to the \u03b1 s variations of the Pythia8 sample.

The purity defines the probability that an observable, was generated at truth level in the same bin as it was finally reconstructed, i.e. in our case that the measured value of u is in the same bin as the generated p T (W ) value normalized by the number of reconstructed events in the given bin.

In order to give a estimate of these effects, we have changed the hadronic recoil resolution relatively by \u2248 5% during the forward folding procedure, which mimics a difference between the assumed and the real detector description. The comparison of the unfolded ATLAS data set compared with the expected distribution using the stated difference in the hadronic recoil resolution is shown in Figure 11. The ratio also indicates the systematic uncertainty band due to the nominal unfolding procedure and the uncertainty band including the additional uncertainty on the hadronic recoil resolution. While the expected uncertainties do not change for p T (W ) > 15 GeV, we see an increase to 5% in the region of 8 to 15 GeV, as well as a modest increase in uncertainty for the very low p T region.

The limitations of the functional fitting approach are due to the accuracy of the function description of the true boson p T distribution. A direct comparison of the expected systematic uncertainties due to the methodology is shown in Figure 12 for two pile-up scenarios. The maximal uncertainty of the functional forward fitting approach is significantly smaller over nearly the full range than the expected uncertainties in a Bayesian unfolding approach. Even more importantly, the functional fitting approach provides an unbinned description of the truth spectrum within the limitations of the fitting function. However, several aspects have to be considered. The presented methodology uncertainty of the functional fitting approach cannot be interpreted in a Gaussian way, but rather similarly to a range-fit approach. Hence the truth distribution is expected to lie within the stated uncertainty band, which was already conservatively chosen, but no likelihood can be given. Moreover, no detector uncertainties have been considered, since they are expected to play a similar role for both approaches.",

In future years, the functional description could be in principle directly taken from a theoretical prediction based on NNLO and NNLL calculations, which depends only on a small set of model parameters such as the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s and a resummation parameter g. The advantage of directly using physical parameters during the forward folding lies in the well defined resulting systematic uncertainties of these parameters. However, it is currently not yet possible to evaluate such a functional description following from QCD calculations, in a reasonable time, as a large number of generated events is required for each step in the fitting procedure. Therefore, we have presented a semi-empirical function with three independent parameters that describes a large variety of possible p T (W ) spectra to high precision. With this function, the measured p T (W ) spectrum is expected not to exceed a systematic uncertainty of typically 5% up to transverse momenta of 40 GeV.",

Both approaches degrade significantly in precision when going from \u00b5 = 5 to \u00b5 = 20, but degrade only mildly when increasing the pile-up to \u00b5 = 40. This behavior is expected, as the additional pile-up contribution should scale as \u00b5 . While the tuning of model parameters of approximated QCD calculations will also be performed in future on the high precision p T (Z) data, the novel approach presented here allows a testing of these predictions using W boson data directly even in high pile-up environments. This would also allow one to estimate the uncertainty of the modeling of p T (W ) on the W boson mass measurement in a rigorous way.",
