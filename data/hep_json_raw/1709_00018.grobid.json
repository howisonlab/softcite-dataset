The dominant contribution is found to be J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) decays to \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 . In the J/\u03c8 decay, the branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 ) is determined to be (7.90 \u00b1 0.19(stat) \u00b1 0.49(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . Two solutions are found in the \u03c8(3686) decay, and the corresponding branching fraction B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 ) is (1.02 \u00b1 0.11(stat) \u00b1 0.24(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 for the case of destructive interference, and (5.69 \u00b1 1.28(stat) \u00b1 2.36(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22126 for constructive interference. As a consequence, the ratios of branching fractions between \u03c8(3686) and J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 are calculated to be (12.9 \u00b1 1.4(stat) \u00b1 3.1(sys))% and (7.2 \u00b1 1.6(stat) \u00b1 3.0(sys))%, respectively. We also determine the inclusive branching fractions of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 to be (1.36 \u00b1 0.02(stat) \u00b1 0.08(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and (1.51 \u00b1 0.14(stat) \u00b1 0.23(sys)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , respectively.",

In particular, the decay \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 is an isospin symmetry breaking process. The measurement of its branching fraction (BR) will shed light on the isospin breaking effects in \u03c8 \u2192 V P (where V and P represent vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively) decays [2], and can be also used to calculate the associated electromagnetic form factors [3], which are used to test quantum chromodynamics (QCD) inspired models of mesonic wave functions. In the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD), the partial width for the \u03c8 decays into an exclusive hadronic final state is expected to be proportional to the square of the cc wave function overlap at the origin, which is well determined from the leptonic width [4]. Thus the ratio of BRs of \u03c8(3686) and J/\u03c8 decays to any specific final state H is expected to be Q H = B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 H) B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 H) \u2243 B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) \u224312.7%,",

Although the rule works well for some decay modes, it fails spectacularly in the \u03c8 decays to V P [3,5] such as \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 [6]. A precise measurement of the BR for \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 also provides a good opportunity to test the \"12% rule\". The current world average BR of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 decay is B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 ) = (1.05 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , according to the particle data group (PDG) [7].

According to the MC study, the background sources in the J/\u03c8 decay can be categorized into two classes. The class I background is dominated by the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b7 with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which do not include an \u03b7 \u2032 intermediate state.

The systematic uncertainties can be divided into two main categories. The first category is from the event selection, including the uncertainties on the photon detection efficiency, MDC tracking efficiency, trigger efficiency, PID efficiency, the kinematic fit, the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mass window requirements, the cited BRs and the number of \u03c8 events.

Thus, the uncertainty associated with the two reconstructed photons is 1.2% (0.6% per photon) by weighting the uncertainties according to the polar angle distribution of the two photons from real data. The uncertainty due to the charged tracking efficiency has been investigated with control samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [35], and a difference of 1% per track between data and MC simulation is considered as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty arising from the trigger efficiency is negligible according to the studies in Ref. [36]. The uncertainty due to PID efficiency has been studied with control samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and the difference in PID efficiencies between the data and MC simulation is determined to be 4.0% (1.0% per track). This is taken as the systematic uncertainty. A systematic uncertainty associated with the kinematic fit occurs due to the inconsistency of track-helix parameters between the data and MC simulation. Following the procedure described in Ref. [37], we use J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 (J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) decays as the control sample to determine the correction factors of the pull distributions of the track-helix parameters for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) decays, respectively. We estimate the detection efficiencies using MC samples with and without the corrected helix parameters for the charged tracks, and the resulting differences in the detection efficiencies, 0.3% for the J/\u03c8 sample and 1.0% for the \u03c8(3686) sample, are assigned as the systematic uncertainties associated with the kinematic fit.",

In the \u03c8(3686) decay, due to low statistics, the PWA indicates that only two components, \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7 \u2032 and NR \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 are sufficient to describe the data. The same fit quality is obtained with either destructive or constructive interference between the two components.
