Two observables are studied: A C based on the identified charged leptons, and A tt C , based on the reconstructed tt final state. The asymmetries are measured to be A C = 0.024 \u00b1 0.015 (stat.) \u00b1 0.009 (syst.) , A tt C = 0.021 \u00b1 0.025 (stat.) \u00b1 0.017 (syst.) .",

It is the only quark in the Standard Model (SM) that decays before hadronization occurs, and the only quark with Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson close to unity. A precise study of top quark properties could shed light on possible physics models beyond the SM [3][4][5][6][7][8][9].",

In SM tt production, the asymmetry is absent at leading-order (LO) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and is introduced by the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD contributions to the tt differential cross-sections, which are odd with respect to the exchange of t andt. At the LHC, the contributions to the asymmetries defined in eq. (1.1) and eq. (1.3) are predominantly from qq-initiated tt production, and qg-initiated production also has a non-negligible contribution. The gg-initiated processes are symmetric [10]. The asymmetry predicted in the SM is slightly positive, implying that the top quark is preferentially emitted in the direction of the quark in the initial state. In qq interactions at the LHC, the quark is in most cases a valence quark whereas the antiquark is from the sea. The asymmetry translates to a higher boost along the beam direction for the t-quark than for thet-quark. The rapidity distribution of the t is thus slightly broader than the one of thet.",

Recent next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations of the forward-backward asymmetry for the Tevatron suggest that varying these scales significantly underestimates the uncertainty due to higher order corrections [11], but no NNLO calculation has yet been published for pp interactions at the LHC energies.

An analogously defined lepton-based forward-backward asymmetry in tt production has been studied as well. At the Tevatron, tt events are predominantly produced by qq annihilation, thus the predicted asymmetries are typically larger than at the LHC, where gg-initiated production dominates. The Tevatron experiments have reported deviations of forward-backward asymmetries from the SM predictions [22,23], which have motivated a number of further asymmetry measurements. Comparing the results with the latest NNLO calculations available at the Tevatron [11], the deviations reported by the CDF collaboration [24][25][26] are reduced, while the latest measurements by the D0 collaboration [27,28] are now in good agreement with the predictions. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the main components of the ATLAS detector relevant for this measurement are summarized. In section 3 the simulated samples used for the analysis are presented. In section 4 the object and event selection are described. In section 5 the kinematic reconstruction used for the A tt C measurement is detailed. For comparison with theory prediction, the measurements are corrected for detector resolution and acceptance effects, as presented in section 6. Sections 7 and 8 describe the systematic uncertainties and the measurement results, respectively. Finally, the conclusions are given in section 9.",

The analysis makes use of reconstructed electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse momentum in the detector. Electrons are reconstructed as clusters of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter, matched to a track in the inner detector. They are required to pass a set of tight selection criteria [65]. The selected electrons have to satisfy a requirement on their transverse energy (E T ) and the pseudorapidity of the associated calorimeter cluster (|\u03b7 cluster |): E T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7 cluster | < 2.47. The electrons in the region 1.37 < |\u03b7 cluster | < 1.52, which corresponds to a transition between the barrel and endcap electromagnetic calorimeters, are excluded. Electrons are required to be isolated, using the requirements described as follows (excluding calorimeter deposits and tracks from the electrons). The E T within a cone of size \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.2 and the scalar sum of track p T within a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 around the electron are required to be below E T -and \u03b7-dependent thresholds. The efficiency of this isolation requirement on electrons is 90%, and its goal is to reduce the contribution from hadrons mimicking lepton signatures, as well as leptons produced in heavy-hadron decays or photon conversion. These are referred to as fake and non-prompt leptons (NP) in the following.",

The four-momenta of top quarks in selected events are computed with a kinematic reconstruction using the objects observed in the detector. The reconstruction is based on solving the kinematic equations obtained when imposing energy-momentum conservation at each of the decay vertices of the process. In the dilepton channel, at least two neutrinos are produced and escape undetected. Consequently, the system is underconstrained and its kinematics cannot be fully determined without further assumptions (for example on the W boson and top quark masses, and the pseudorapidities of the neutrinos from the W boson decays). Moreover, several ambiguities have to be resolved to find the correct solution. For example, the lepton and jet from the same decay chain have to be associated. In an event with two leptons and two jets, this leads to two possible associations. In this analysis, the neutrino weighting technique [72] is used. This procedure steps through different hypotheses for the pseudorapidity of the two neutrinos in the final state. These hypotheses are made independently for the two neutrinos. For each hypothesis, the algorithm calculates the full event kinematics, assuming the W boson and the top quark masses. It then assigns a weight to the resulting solution based on the level of agreement between the calculated and measured missing transverse momentum. The weight is defined as ",

Two models with a new colour octet particle exchanged in the s-channel are considered. In the model with the light octet, the new particle mass is below the tt production threshold. The model with the heavy octet uses the octet mass beyond the reach of the LHC. The new particles would not be visible as resonances in the m tt spectrum at the Tevatron or at the LHC. The light octet is assumed to have a mass of m = 250 GeV and a width of \u0393 = 0.2m. For the heavy octet, the corrections to tt production are independent of the mass but instead depend on the ratio of coupling to mass, which is assumed to be 1/TeV. In  Figure 8.

The LHC asymmetry measurements in the dilepton decay channel are excluded from the fit. While the models span a sizeable range of values in the A C and A tt C plane in figure 8, their predictions are consistent with the measured value within the present uncertainties. Thus the potential BSM contributions cannot be excluded beyond the reach of the previous Tevatron and LHC measurements. Future A C and A tt C measurements with a larger dataset could however further constrain the allowed couplings of the colour octet models if both statistical and systematic uncertainties can be reduced further.",

The measurements are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events are required to have exactly two charged leptons (electron or muon), large missing transverse momentum and at least two jets. Both the lepton-based asymmetry A C and the tt asymmetry A tt C are extracted in three channels: ee, e\u00b5 and \u00b5\u00b5. The measurement of A tt C requires the kinematic reconstruction of the tt system, which is performed using the neutrino weighting technique. Agreement between predictions and data is checked after selection and kinematic reconstruction. Good agreement is obtained for all the kinematic observables studied. The \u2206|\u03b7| and tt \u2206|y| distributions and inclusive asymmetries are corrected for detector and acceptance effects. Corrections are applied using bin-by-bin corrections for A C and fully bayesian unfolding for A tt C . The distributions of lepton \u2206|\u03b7| and tt \u2206|y| after",
