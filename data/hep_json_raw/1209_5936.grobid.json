A prime example here is the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. Using its large-acceptance hadronic spectrometer, SHINE aims to accomplish a number of physics goals: measuring spectra of identified hadrons in hadron-nucleus collisions to provide reference for accelerator neutrino experiments and cosmic-ray observatories, investigating particle properties in the large transverse-momentum range for hadron+hadron and hadron+nucleus collisions for studying the nuclear modification factor at SPS energies, and measuring hadronic observables in a particularly interesting region of the phase diagram of strongly-interacting matter to study the onset of deconfinement and search for the critical point of stronglyinteracting matter with nucleus-nucleus collisions. This contribution shall summarise results obtained so far by NA61/SHINE, as well as present the current status and plans of its experimental programme.",

It stems from differences in quantum-phase propagation of different neutrino mass eigenstates and as such requires neutrinos to have mass. One way to obtain accurate measurements of neutrino oscillation is to perform it on neutrinos produced in a controlled environment of a particle accelerator: a high-energy beam of protons is collided against a graphite target to produce positive pions and kaons, which subsequently decay into muons and muon neutrinos.",

In order to achieve adequate beam intensity the graphite target must be long, leading to secondary interactions. Moreover, a non-negligible contribution to the flux is made by interactions with support structures such as the target holder and cooling systems. In short, good knowledge of properties of the resulting neutrino beam requires good knowledge of hadron production in the target -which in turn may be much easier to study using an identical target at a fixed-target facility oriented towards hadron spectroscopy than having to set up necessary detectors in situ. Given the energies of proton beams typically used for production of neutrino beams, the CERN SPS complex (indeed, in case of the CNGS beam the proton accelerator in question is the SPS) is a perfect candidate for this task.",

In particular, evolution of the hadronic component of showers remains relatively poorly understood. With primary energies of ultra high-energy cosmic rays remaining largely out of range of man-made accelerators, one is required to employ simulations to provide reference for such evolution -which in turn requires careful tuning of models used for this purpose. This is where measuring hadron spectra at the SPS comes in. Although its energy range falls several orders of magnitude short of the energy of cosmic rays observed by EAS detectors (E 0 = 10 15 \u2212 10 20 eV, it provides an excellent match to the energy of the last generation of hadronic interactions in the shower. As many experimental observables (e.g. the number of muons detected by surface detectors) are directly tied to this stage of shower evolution, studying it at the SPS is expected to yield significantly improved predictions.

However, in the past data sets of this sort at SPS energies and below were relatively small. This problem becomes particularly pressing in case of high-p T hadrons, originating from hard scatterings and thus useful for probing the perturbative-quantum chromodynamics (QCD) regime of strong interactions -they are produced so rarely that most such elementary collisions contain none at all, further reducing effective sample size. Fortunately, development of sophisticated detectors and readout components capable of coping with high event rates of high-luminosity machines such as the LHC has made it possible to also improve event rates of lower-energy detectors, allowing at last collection of large-statistics p+p and p+A data sets. Analysis of this data is expected to greatly improve precision of many existing results as well as allow new, hitherto-infeasible studies.",

These results have already been used by the T2K experiment as reference for calculations of neutrino flux in the J-PARC beam, leading to their first measurement of the \u03b8 13 \u03bd mixing angle [2]. Moreover, comparison of pion spectra with models have made it possible to introduce improvements to UrQMD as well as to the implementation of FRITIOF in the Geant4 toolkit [2] [2]. Results from data taken in 2009, offering a factor-of-ten increase in statistics as well improved particle identification through extension of the forward Time-of-Flight wall, are being prepared for release. . Left: Inclusive spectra of positively-charged kaons measured by NA61/SHINE in p+C collisions at 31 GeV (points), compared to predictions by various models (lines). Right: Comparison of the K + /\u03c0 + ratio, using the above data along with results shown in Fig. 3, again compared to models [2]. Additional, preliminary results from p+C interactions at 31 GeV have been compared to measurements of NA49 in Pb+Pb collisions [2]. Transverse-mass and forward rapidity spectra of negative pions were extracted and compared to NA49 results from central Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV (see Figure 5). We have also begun investigating yields of \u039b, K 0 S and \u0394 ++ particles in these interactions. Last but not least, we have recently presented the first preliminary \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u2212 and p spectra from p+p interactions at 40, 80 and 158 GeV -reference data sets for the phase-diagram scan [2]; an overviews of these results can be found in Figure 6. Analogous measurements from p+p events at 13, 20 and 31 GeV are to follow suit.",
