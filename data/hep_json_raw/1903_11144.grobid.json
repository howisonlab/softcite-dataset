The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected in 2016 with the CMS detector. Events with two opposite-sign isolated leptons (electrons or muons), and b quark jets in the final state are selected. The search is sensitive to new physics in top quark pair production and in single top quark production in association with a W boson. No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed. Results are interpreted in the framework of effective field theory and constraints on the relevant effective couplings are set, one at a time, using a dedicated multivariate analysis. This analysis differs from previous searches for new physics in the top quark sector by explicitly separating tW from tt events and exploiting the specific sensitivity of the tW process to new physics.",

            "text": "Because of its large mass, close to the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale, the top quark is predicted to play an important role in several new physics scenarios. If the new physics scale is in the available energy range of the CERN LHC, the existence of new physics could be directly observed via the production of new particles. Otherwise, new physics could affect standard model (SM) interactions indirectly, through modifications of SM couplings or enhancements of rare SM processes. In this case, it is useful to introduce a model independent approach to parametrize and constrain possible deviations from SM predictions, independently of the fundamental theory of new physics.",

Most of the previous analyses followed the anomalous coupling approach in which the SM Lagrangian is extended for possible new interactions. Another powerful framework e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch to parametrize deviations with respect to the SM prediction is the effective field theory (EFT) [11,12]. Constraints obtained on anomalous couplings can be translated to the effective coupling bounds [1,13]. Several groups have performed global fits of top quark EFT to unfolded experimental data from the Tevatron and LHC colliders [14,15]. Due to the limited access to data and details of the associated uncertainties, correlations between various cross section measurements and related uncertainties are neglected in a global fit on various unfolded measurements. On the other hand, EFT operators could affect backgrounds for some processes constructively or destructively while cross sections are measured with the SM assumptions for background processes. Inside the CMS Collaboration and with direct access to data, all mentioned points could be considered properly.",

The parameters C (3) \u03c6q , C tW , C tG , C G and C u(c)G stand for the dimensionless Wilson coefficients, also called effective couplings. The variable \u039b represents the energy scale beyond which new physics becomes relevant. A detailed description of the operators is given in Refs. [13,16,17]. In this analysis, fourfermion operators involved in tt production are not probed. Up to order \u039b \u22122 , the tW and tt production cross sections and most of the differential observables considered in this analysis do not receive CP-odd contributions. Therefore, we only probe CP-even operators with real coefficients. The operators O (3) \u03c6q and O tW modify the SM interaction between the W boson, top quark, and b quark (Wtb). We consider the EFT effects in the production of top quarks not in their decays [18]. The operator O tG is called the chromomagnetic dipole moment operator of the top quark and can arise from various models of new physics [19,20]. The triple-gluon field strength operator O G represents the only genuinely gluonic CP conserving term that can appear at dimension six within an effective strong interaction Lagrangian. Although it is shown that jet production at the LHC can set a tight constraint on the C G [21], tt production is also considered as a promising channel [22,23]. The operators O uG and O cG lead to flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions of the top quark and contribute to tW production. The effect of introducing new couplings C",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionisation chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [24].",

The pythia tune CUETP8M1 [30] is used for all samples except for the tt sample, for which the tune CUETP8M2 [31] is used. The NNPDF3.0 [32] set of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) is used. The tt and tW samples are normalized to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and approximate NNLO cross section calculations, respectively [33,34]. In order to better describe the transverse momentum ( p T ) distribution of the top quark in tt events, the top quark p T spectrum simulated with powheg is reweighted to match the differential top quark p T distribution at NNLO quantum chromoDynamics (QCD) accuracy and including EW corrections calculated in Ref. [35]. Other SM background contributions, from Drell-Yan (DY), tt+V, tt+\u03b3, and W + \u03b3 processes, are simulated at NLO using the MadGraph5_amc@nlo (v2.2.2) event generator [36][37][38], interfaced with pythia v8 for parton showering and hadronization. The events include the effects of additional pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) and are weighted according to the observed pileup distribution in the analyzed data. The CMS detector response is simulated using Geant4 (v9.4) [39,40], followed by a detailed trigger simulation. Simulated events are reconstructed with the same algorithms as used for data.",

Jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks are identified using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [53]; this algorithm combines information from track impact parameters and secondary vertices identified within a given jet. The chosen working point provides a signal identification efficiency of approximately 68% with a probability to misidentify lightflavor jets as bjets of approximately 1% [53]. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the proton beams axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates in the event [54].

The events are divided into the ee, e\u03bc, and \u03bc\u03bc channels according to the flavors of the two leptons with the highest p T and are further categorized in different bins depending on the number of jets (\"n-jets\") and number b-tagged jets (\"mtags\") in the final state. The largest number of tW events is expected in the category with exactly one b-tagged jet (1jet,1-tag) followed by the category with two jets, of which one a bjet (2-jets,1-tag). Events in the categories with more than two jets and exactly two b-tagged jets are dominated by the tt process (\u22652-jets,2-tags).

A systematic uncertainty of 2.5% is assigned to the integrated luminosity and is used for signal and background rates [58]. The efficiency corrections for trigger and offline selection of leptons were estimated by comparing the efficiency measured in data and in MC simulation using Z \u2192 events, based on a \"tag-and-probe\" method as in Ref. [59]. The scale factors obtained are varied by one standard deviation to take into account the corresponding uncertainties in the efficiency.

Two schemes for defining the tW signal in a way that distinguishes it from the tt production have been compared in the analysis: the \"diagram removal\" (DR), in which all doubly resonant NLO tW diagrams are removed, and the \"diagram subtraction\" (DS), where a gauge-invariant subtractive term modifies the NLO tW cross section to locally cancel the contribution from tt production [66][67][68]. The DR method is used for the nominal tW sample and the difference with respect to the sample simulated using the DS method is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The model parameter h damp in tt powheg [25] that controls the matching of the matrix elements to the pythia parton showers is varied from a top quark mass default value of 172.5 GeV by factors of 0.5 and 2 for estimating the uncertainties from the matching between jets from matrix element calculations and parton shower emissions. The renormalization scale for QCD emissions in the initialand final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) is varied up and down by factors of 2 and \u221a 2, respectively, to account for parton shower QCD scale variation error in both tt and tW samples [69]. In addition, several dedicated tt samples are used to estimate shower modeling uncertainties in both underlying event and color re-connections [10, 31,69]. To estimate model uncertainties, tW and tt samples are generated with powheg as described in Sect. 2, varying the relevant model parameters with respect to the nominal samples.",

The impact of the difference between the kinematic distributions of tt events from the O G interaction and from the SM interactions on the acceptance is evaluated to be 3% for C G \u223c 1. This uncertainty is considered only for the C G coupling since the top p T spectrum is affected considerably by this operator, while other operators lead to a p T spectrum similar to the SM prediction for unconstrained values of the probed Wilson coefficients. The fit is performed simultaneously on the observed event yields in the categories presented in Fig. 2 in  the (1-jet, 1-tag), (2-jets, 1-tag), and (\u22652-jets, 2-tags) categories for the ee, e\u03bc, and \u03bc\u03bc channels. In addition, the (1-jet, 0-tag) category is included only for the e\u03bc channel. The main limiting factor on the constraints in the C G coupling is the uncertainty in the signal acceptance found after maximizing the likelihood, followed by uncertainties in the integrated luminosity calibration and the trigger scale factor.",
