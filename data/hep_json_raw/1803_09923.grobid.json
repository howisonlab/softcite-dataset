Data collected with the ATLAS detector from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , are analysed. The search is performed using topquark pair events, with one top quark decaying through the t \u2192 qZ (q = u, c) flavourchanging neutral-current channel, and the other through the dominant Standard Model mode t \u2192 bW . Only Z boson decays into charged leptons and leptonic W boson decays are considered as signal. Consequently, the final-state topology is characterized by the presence of three isolated charged leptons (electrons or muons), at least two jets, one of the jets originating from a b-quark, and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. The data are consistent with Standard Model background contributions, and at 95% confidence level the search sets observed (expected) upper limits of 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) on the t \u2192 uZ branching ratio and 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) on the t \u2192 cZ branching ratio, constituting the most stringent limits to date.",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known, with a mass m t = 173.3 \u00b1 0.8 GeV [1]. In the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), it decays almost exclusively into bW while flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays such as t \u2192 qZ are forbidden at tree level. FCNC decays occur at one-loop level but are strongly suppressed by the GIM mechanism [2] with a suppression factor of 14 orders of magnitude relative to the dominant decay mode [3]. However, several SM extensions predict higher branching ratios for top-quark FCNC decays. Examples of such extensions are the quark-singlet model (QS) [4], the two-Higgs-doublet model with (FC 2HDM) or without (2HDM) flavour conservation [5], the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [6], the MSSM with R-parity violation (RPV SUSY) [7], models with warped extra dimensions (RS) [8], or extended mirror fermion models (EMF) [9]. Reference [10] gives a comprehensive review of the various extensions of the SM that have been proposed. Table 1 provides the maximum values for the branching ratios B(t \u2192 qZ) predicted by these models and compares them to the value predicted by the SM.",

The x-axis points from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The \u2206R distance is defined as \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .",

Energy deposits over the full coverage of the calorimeters, |\u03b7| < 4.9, are used to reconstruct jets and missing transverse momentum. A two-level trigger system is used to select interesting events [26]. The first level is implemented with custom hardware and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate. It is followed by a software-based trigger level to reduce the event rate to approximately 1 kHz. In this analysis, the combined 2015 and 2016 datasets from proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 are used. Analysed events are selected by either a single-electron or a single-muon trigger. Triggers with different transverse-momentum thresholds are used to increase the overall efficiency. The triggers using a low electron transverse momentum (p e T ) or muon transverse momentum (p \u00b5 T ) threshold (p e T > 24 GeV or p \u00b5 T > 20 GeV for 2015 data and p e,\u00b5 T > 26 GeV for 2016 data) also have isolation requirements. At high p T the isolation requirements incur small efficiency losses which are recovered by higher-threshold triggers (p e T > 60 GeV, p e T > 120 GeV, or p \u00b5 T > 50 GeV for 2015 data and p e T > 60 GeV, p e T > 140 GeV, or p \u00b5 T > 50 GeV for 2016 data) without isolation requirements.",

The theoretical estimates for these backgrounds are further constrained by the simultaneous fit to the signal and control regions described below. Events with non-prompt leptons or events in which at least one jet is misidentified as an isolated charged lepton (labelled as non-prompt leptons throughout this article) can also fulfil the event selection requirements. These events, typically Z+jets (including \u03b3 emission), tt, and single-top (W t), are estimated with the semi-data-driven method explained in section 6, which also uses simulated samples which for the Z+jets events include Z production in association with heavy-flavour quarks. Table 2 summarizes information about the generators, parton shower, and PDFs used to simulate the different event samples considered in the analysis. The associated production of a tt pair with one vector boson was generated at NLO with MG5 aMC@NLO interfaced to Pythia8 with the A14 set of tuned parameters and the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. The ttZ and ttW samples were normalized to the NLO QCD+electroweak cross-section calculation using a fixed scale (m t + m V /2) [43]. In the case of the ttZ sample with the Z \u2192 + \u2212 decay mode, the Z/\u03b3 * interference was included with the criterion m > 5 GeV applied. The t-channel production of a single top quark in association with a Z boson (tZ) was generated using MG5 aMC@NLO using the four-flavour PDF scheme. Production of a single top quark in the W t-channel together with a Z boson (W tZ) was generated with MG5 aMC@NLO with the parton shower simulated using Pythia8, the PDF set NNPDF2.3LO, and the A14 set of tuned parameters. The diagram removal technique [44] was employed to handle the overlap of W tZ with ttZ and tt production followed by a three-body top-quark decay (t \u2192 W Zb). The procedure also removes the interference between W tZ and these two processes. Diboson processes with four charged leptons (4 ), three charged leptons and one neutrino ( \u03bd), two charged leptons and two neutrinos ( \u03bd\u03bd), and diboson processes having additional hadronic contributions ( \u03bdjj, jj, gg , \u03bd\u03bdjj) were simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 [45] generator. The matrix elements contain all diagrams with four electroweak vertices. They were calculated for up to one (4 , 2 + 2\u03bd) or no additional partons (3 + 1\u03bd) at NLO and up to three partons at LO using the Comix [46] and OpenLoops [47] matrix element generators and were merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [46][47][48]. The CT10 PDF set was used in conjunction with a dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. The Higgs boson samples (ttH, Higgs boson production via gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson) were normalized to the theoretical calculations in ref. [43].  Table 2. Generators, parton shower simulation, parton distribution functions, and tune parameters used to produce simulated samples for this analysis.

Due to the high lepton-multiplicity requirement of the event selection and to increase the sample size, the tt sample was produced by selecting only true dilepton events in the final state. The SM production of three or four top quarks and the associated production of a tt pair with two W bosons were generated at LO with MG5 aMC@NLO+Pythia8. The production of three massive vector bosons with subsequent leptonic decays of all three bosons was modelled at LO with the Sherpa 2.1.1 generator.

Table 8 shows the expected number of background events, number of selected data events, and signal yields in the SR before and after the fit. The post-fit signal yield changes relative to the pre-fit one due to the fitted nuisance parameters. The yields in the CRs after the fit are shown in table 9. Good agreement between data and the expectation from the backgroundonly hypothesis is observed, and no evidence of a FCNC signal is found. The upper limits on B(t \u2192 qZ) are computed with the CL s method [84, 85] using the asymptotic properties of q \u00b5 [86][87][88] and assuming that only one FCNC mode contributes. Figure 4 shows the observed CL s for B(t \u2192 uZ) and B(t \u2192 cZ) together with the \u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 bands for the expected values. The 95% confidence level (CL) limit on B(t \u2192 uZ) is 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and on B(t \u2192 cZ) it is 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The observed and expected limits are shown in table 10. It can be seen that the observed limit is about 1\u03c3 more stringent than expected due to a smaller number of observed events in the first bin of the \u03c7 2 distribution in the SR, which is the one with the largest sensitivity to the signal.",

The data were collected by the ATLAS experiment in pp collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 at the LHC at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. There is good agreement between the data and Standard Model expectations, and no evidence of a signal is found. The 95% CL limits on the t \u2192 qZ branching ratio are B(t \u2192 uZ) < 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(t \u2192 cZ) < 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , improving previous ATLAS results by more than 60%. These limits constrain the values of effective field theory operators contributing to the t \u2192 uZ and t \u2192 cZ FCNC decays of the top quark.  Table 9.

The \u03c7 2 minimization gives the most probable value for p \u03bd z for a given combination. The combination with the minimum \u03c7 2 is chosen, which fixes the assignment of reconstructed particles and the corresponding p \u03bd z value. The jet from the top-quark FCNC decay is referred to as the light-quark (q) jet. The fractions of correct assignments between the reconstructed top quarks and the true simulated particles (evaluated as a match within a cone of size \u2206R = 0.4) are t FCNC = 80% and t SM = 58%, where the difference comes from the fact that for the SM top-quark decay the match of theE miss T with the simulated neutrino is less efficient.
