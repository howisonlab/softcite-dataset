These measurements were performed using pp collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 and 20.3 fb \u22121 at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l signal is observed with a significance of 8.1 standard deviations, with an expectation of 6.2 standard deviations, at m H \u00bc 125.36 GeV, the combined ATLAS measurement of the Higgs boson mass from the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l channels. The production rate relative to the Standard Model expectation, the signal strength, is measured in four different production categories in the H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l channel. The measured signal strength, at this mass, and with all categories combined, is 1.44 \u00fe0.40   \u22120.33 . The signal strength for Higgs boson production in gluon fusion or in association with tt or bb pairs is found to be 1.7 \u00fe0.5 \u22120.4 , while the signal strength for vector-boson fusion combined with WH=ZH associated production is found to be 0.3 \u00fe1.6 \u22120.9 .",

The ATLAS and CMS experiments have reported the observation of a particle in the search for the SM Higgs boson [4,5], where the most sensitive channels are H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l, H \u2192 WW \u00c3 \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. An important step in the confirmation of the new particle as the SM Higgs boson is the measurement of its properties, which are completely defined in the SM once its mass is known. Previous ATLAS studies [6,7] have shown that this particle is consistent with the SM Higgs boson.",

Searching for Higgs boson production in the vector-boson fusion (VBF) and the vector-boson associated production (VH) modes allows further exploration of the coupling structure of the new particle. The corresponding fractions of the production cross section for VBF and VH are predicted to be 7% and 5%, respectively. This paper presents the final ATLAS Run 1 results of the measurement of the SM Higgs boson production in the H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l decay mode, where the production is studied both inclusively and with events categorized according to the characteristics of the different production modes. The categorized analysis allows constraints to be placed on possible deviations from the expected couplings of the SM Higgs boson. The data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected in the years 2011 and 2012, respectively.",

The cross sections for the ggF process have been calculated to NLO [26][27][28] and NNLO [29][30][31] in QCD. In addition, QCD soft-gluon resummations calculated in the NNLL approximation are applied for the ggF process [32]. NLO electroweak (EW) radiative corrections are also applied [33,34]. These results are compiled in Refs. [35][36][37] assuming factorization between QCD and EW corrections. For the VBF process, full QCD and EW corrections up to NLO [38][39][40] and approximate NNLO QCD [41] corrections are used to calculate the cross section. The cross sections for the associated WH=ZH production processes are calculated at NLO [42] and at NNLO [43] in QCD, and NLO EW radiative corrections are applied [44]. The cross section for associated Higgs boson production with a tt pair is calculated at NLO in QCD [45][46][47][48]. The cross section for the bbH process is calculated in the four-flavor scheme at NLO in QCD [49][50][51] and in the five-flavor scheme at NNLO in QCD [52] and combined via the Santander matching scheme [25,53].",

All candidate electron tracks are fitted using a Gaussian-sum filter [77] (GSF) to account for bremsstrahlung energy losses. The GSF fit brings the candidate electron E=p distribution closer to unity and improves the measured electron direction, resulting in better impact parameter resolution. For the 2012 (8 TeV) data set, the electron reconstruction was modified to allow for large bremsstrahlung energy losses. A second pass was added to the ATLAS track pattern recognition that allows for an electron hypothesis with larger energy loss to be tried after a first pass with a pion hypothesis. Furthermore, the trackto-cluster matching algorithm was improved, for example by incorporating an additional test that extrapolates tracks to the calorimeter using the measured cluster energy rather than the track momentum. These improvements increased the electron reconstruction efficiency on average by 5% for electrons with E T above 15 GeV, with a 7% improvement for E T at 15 GeV, as measured with data [78].",

To maintain both large acceptance and good discrimination, the selection is kept \"loose\" for a large number of discriminating variables; for comparison, the most stringent electron identification would induce an additional 15% reduction in electron efficiency. Compared to the previous measurement [6], the electron identification was improved for the 2012 data set by moving from a cut-based method to a likelihood method. The likelihood allows the inclusion of discriminating variables that are difficult to use with explicit cuts without incurring significant efficiency losses. For example, the GSF fit measures a significant difference between the momenta at the start and end of the electron trajectory for only a fraction of true electrons so that requiring a large difference for all electrons would not be an efficient selection cut. The likelihood improves the rejection of light-flavor jets and photon conversions by a factor of 2 for the same signal efficiency. For the 2011 (7 TeV) data set, the electron reconstruction proceeds as described above, but without the improved pattern recognition and cluster-to-track matching. The electron identification used for the 2011 data set is the same cut-based identification as in the previous measurement [6]. Detailed descriptions of the likelihood identification used for the 2012 data set, the cut-based identification used for the 2011 data set and the corresponding efficiency measurements can be found in Refs. [78,79].",

The cluster energy is corrected for energy lost before the calorimeter, deposited in neighboring cells and beyond the calorimeter. Further corrections for the response dependence are applied as a function of the impact point within the central cluster cell. The cluster energy measurement was improved compared to the previous analysis [6] and is described elsewhere [76]. Several of the steps in the energy calibration were significantly improved including: (a) the addition of a multivariate technique to extract the cluster energy from the energy deposit in simulation, (b) additional corrections for response details not included in the simulation, and (c) equalization of the energy scales of the longitudinal calorimeter layers.",

Most muon candidates are identified by matching a reconstructed ID track with either a complete or partial track reconstructed in the MS [80,81]. If a complete MS track is present, the two independent momentum measurements are combined (combined muons); otherwise the momentum is measured using the ID, and the partial MS track serves as identification (segment-tagged muons). The muon reconstruction and identification coverage is extended by using tracks reconstructed in the forward region (2.5 < j\u03b7j < 2.7) of the MS, which is outside the ID coverage (standalone muons). In the center of the barrel region (j\u03b7j < 0.1), which lacks MS geometrical coverage, ID tracks with p T > 15 GeV are identified as muons if their calorimetric energy deposition is consistent with a minimum ionizing particle (calorimetertagged muons). The inner detector tracks associated with muons that are identified inside the ID acceptance are required to have a minimum number of associated hits in each of the ID subdetectors to ensure good track reconstruction. The muon candidates outside the ID acceptance that are reconstructed only in the MS are required to have hits in each of the three stations they traverse. At most one standalone or calorimeter-tagged muon is used per event.",

V). The algorithm for this clustering suppresses noise by keeping only cells with a significant energy deposit and their neighboring cells. Subsequently, the jets are calibrated to the hadronic energy scale using p T -and \u03b7-dependent correction factors determined from simulation (2011 data set) and from data (2012 data set) [87,89]. The uncertainty on these correction factors is determined from control samples in data.

Furthermore, these simulation-based efficiencies are validated with data using muons accompanying Z \u2192 ll candidates, where the leptons composing the Z boson candidate are required to satisfy isolation and impact parameter criteria. Events with four leptons, or with an opposite-sign dimuon with mass less than 5 GeV, are excluded.

For the training of the BDT discriminant, fully simulated four-lepton Higgs boson signal events produced through ggF and VBF production and hadronically decaying vector boson events for VH production are used. The distributions of these variables for BDT VBF are presented in Figs. 9(a)-9(e), where all the expected features of the VBF production of a Higgs boson can be seen: the dijet system has a high invariant mass and the two jets are emitted in opposite high-j\u03b7j regions with a considerable \u0394\u03b7 separation between them. The jets of ggF events, on the other hand, are more centrally produced and have a smaller invariant mass and \u0394\u03b7 separation. The separation between VBF and ggF can be seen in the output of BDT VBF in Fig. 9(f), where the separation between VBF and ZZ \u00c3 is found to be similar. The output of BDT VBF is unchanged for various mass points around the main training mass of m H \u00bc 125 GeV.

[9], where the Higgs boson mass measurement is reported. The baseline method is a two-dimensional (2D) fit to m 4l and the BDT ZZ \u00c3 output (O BDT ZZ \u00c3 ). This method provides the smallest expected uncertainties for both the mass and inclusive signal strength measurements. The onedimensional (1D) fit to the m 4l distribution that was used in the previous measurements [4,6] is used as a cross-check. A third method, using per-event resolution, is discussed after a description of the 1D and 2D models. The m 4l range used in the fit for all of the methods is 110-140 GeV. A kernel density estimation method [97] uses fully simulated events to obtain smooth distributions for both the 1D and 2D signal models. These templates are produced using samples generated at 15 different m H values in the range 115-130 GeV and parametrized as functions of m H using B-spline interpolation [98].

            "text": "where \u03b8 n defines four equal-sized bins for the value of the BDT ZZ \u00c3 output, and P n represents the 1D probability density function of the signal in the corresponding BDT ZZ \u00c3 bin. The variation of the m 4l shape is negligible within a single BDT ZZ \u00c3 bin, so no bias is introduced in the mass measurement. The background model, P bkg \u00f0m 4l ; O BDT ZZ \u00c3 \u00de, is described using a two-dimensional probability density. For the ZZ \u00c3 and reducible ll \u00fe \u03bc\u03bc backgrounds, the twodimensional probability density distributions are derived from simulation, where the ll \u00fe \u03bc\u03bc simulation was shown to agree well with data in the control region. For the ll \u00fe ee background model, the two-dimensional probability density can only be obtained from data, which is done using the 3l \u00fe X data control region weighted with the transfer factor to match the kinematics of the signal region. Figure 11 shows the probability density in the BDT ZZ \u00c3 -m 4l plane, for the signal with m H \u00bc 125 GeV, the ZZ \u00c3 background from simulation and the reducible background from the data control region. The visible separation between the signal and the background using the BDT ZZ \u00c3 discriminant is exploited in the fit. With respect to the 1D approach, there is an expected reduction of the statistical uncertainty for the mass and inclusive signal strength measurements, which is estimated from simulation to be approximately 8% for both measurements. Both the 1D and the 2D models are built using m 4l after applying a Z-mass constraint to m 12 during the fit, as described in Sec. VA. Figure 12 shows the m 4l distribution for a simulated signal sample with m H \u00bc 125 GeV, after applying the correction for final-state radiation and the Z-mass constraint for the 4\u03bc, 4e and 2e2\u03bc=2\u03bc2e final states. The width of the reconstructed Higgs boson mass for m H \u00bc 125 GeV ranges between 1.6 GeV (4\u03bc final state) and 2.2 GeV (4e final state) and is expected to be dominated by the experimental resolution since, for m H of about 125 GeV, the natural width in the Standard Model is approximately 4 MeV. In addition to the 1D and 2D fit methods described above, the signal probability density for m 4l is also modeled on a per-event basis using both the BDT ZZ \u00c3 information and the energy resolution of the individual leptons. This method is referred to as the per-eventresolution model and is used both as a cross-check for the mass measurement and as the baseline method to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson total width \u0393 H , which is discussed elsewhere [9]. The detector-level m 4l distribution for the signal is obtained for each event through the convolution of an analytic description of the single-lepton detector response with a Breit-Wigner function that describes the Higgs boson mass line shape. The Z-mass constraint is not applied in this fit because this introduces a correlation between the two leptons of the leading Z which must be included in their detector response functions. The parametrization of the muon and electron response function is performed in bins of \u03b7 and p T of the leptons and consists of the sum of two or three normal distributions. This parametrization takes into account the tails of the single-lepton responses. A broad range of cross-checks were performed to validate all the models described above [9].",

V.

This factorization is justified by the negligible dependence of the BDT VBF on m 4l for both signal and background. The BDT VBF dependence on the Higgs boson mass is negligible and is neglected in the probability density. Adding the BDT VBF in the VBF enriched category reduces the expected uncertainty on the signal strength of the VBF and VH production mechanisms \u03bc VBF\u00feVH by about 25%. The improvement in the expected uncertainty on \u03bc VBF\u00feVBF\u00feVH reaches approximately 35% after adding the leptonic and hadronic VH categories to the model. In these two VH categories, a simple onedimensional fit to the m 4l observable is performed, since for the VH-hadronic enriched category, a selection on the BDT VH output is included in the event selection, while for the VH-leptonic enriched category, no BDT is used. Finally, in the ggF enriched category, the 2D model defined in Eq. 2, including the BDT ZZ \u00c3 trained as specified in Sec. VII A, is used. These procedures allow a further reduction of the expected uncertainty on \u03bc VBF\u00feVH (\u03bc ggF\u00fettH\u00febbH ) by 6% (8%).",

In Fig. 13 one observes the single Z \u2192 4l resonance [104,105], the threshold of the ZZ production above 180 GeV and a narrow peak around 125 GeV.

The compatibility of the data with the expectations shown in Fig. 15(a) is checked using pseudoexperiments generated according to the expected two-dimensional distribution and good agreement is found. Figure 15(b) shows the distribution of the BDT ZZ \u00c3 output for the candidates in the m 4l range 120-130 GeV compared with signal and background expectations. In Fig. 15(c) the distribution of the invariant mass of the four leptons is presented for candidates satisfying the requirement that the value of the BDT ZZ \u00c3 output be greater than zero, which maximizes the expected significance for a SM Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV.   2\u03bc2e, yellow line) as well as for their combination (black lines); the scan for the combination of all channels is shown both with (solid line) and without (dashed line) systematic uncertainties.

            "text": "The numbers of expected and observed events in each of the categories described in Sec. V B are summarized in Table XII. The expected yield in each enriched category is given for each of the production modes, where the ggF, bbH and ttH yields are combined. The expected and observed numbers of events are given for two m 4l mass ranges: 120-130 GeV and above 110 GeV. Three of the VBF candidates are found in the mass region 120-130 GeV with invariant masses of 123.2, 123.4 and 125.7 GeV. Only one VBF candidate has a BDT VBF output above zero: m 4l \u00bc 123.4 GeV and a BDT VBF output value of 0.7. In this mass window, the expected number of VBF candidates with BDT VBF output above zero is 1.26 AE 0.15, where half of this is expected to be from a true VBF signal, about 35% from ggF production and the rest is mostly from ZZ \u00c3 and reducible backgrounds. The distributions of m 4l and the BDT VBF output for the VBF enriched category in the full mass range and in the fit range of 110-140 GeV are shown in Fig. 18. The signal purity, defined as S=\u00f0S \u00fe B\u00de, as a function of the BDT VBF output is shown in Fig. 19 for Higgs events relative to the backgrounds and for VBF events relative to the other Higgs boson production mechanisms for 110 < m 4l < 140 GeV. There is no VH candidate in the 120-130 GeV mass range for either the hadronic or leptonic categories. For the full mass range above 110 GeV all categories are dominated by ZZ \u00c3 background, and the observed number of events agrees well with the expectation as can be seen in Table XII. In the following, measurements of the production strengths and couplings are discussed. They are all evaluated assuming the ATLAS combined mass m H \u00bc 125.36 GeV. The measurement of a global signal strength factor, discussed in Sec. X A, can be extended to a measurement of the signal strength factors for specific production modes. The production mechanisms are grouped into the \"fermionic\" and the \"bosonic\" ones. The former consists of ggF, bbH and ttH, while the latter includes the VBF and VH modes. In Fig. 20 the best fit value for \u03bc ggF\u00febbH\u00fettH \u00d7 B=B SM versus \u03bc VBF\u00feVH \u00d7 B=B SM is presented. The factor B=B SM , the scale factor of the branching ratio with respect to the SM value, is included since with a single channel analysis the source of potential deviations from the SM expectation cannot be resolved between production and decay. The profile likelihood ratio contours that correspond to the 68% and 95% confidence levels are also shown. and \u03bc VBF\u00feVH \u00d7 B=B SM \u00bc 0.3 \u00fe1.6 \u22120.9 . The fit to the categories can be constrained to extract a single overall signal strength for the H \u2192ZZ \u00c3 \u21924l final state. . Distributions of the selected events and expected signal and background yields for the VBF enriched category for (a) m 4l and (b) the BDT VBF output in the full mass range, and for (c) m 4l and (d) the BDT VBF output in the fit mass range 110 < m 4l < 140 GeV. The expected Higgs signal contributions, assuming m H \u00bc 125 GeV, from the ggF (blue histogram), VBF (green histogram) and VH (dark-blue histogram) production modes are included. The expected background contributions, ZZ \u00c3 (red histogram) and Z \u00fe jets plus tt (violet histogram), are also shown; the systematic uncertainty associated to the total background contribution is represented by the hatched areas. In every case, the combination of the 7 and 8 TeV results is shown.",

The ambiguity between production and decay is removed in Fig. 20(b), where the ratio \u03bc VBF\u00feVH =\u03bc ggF\u00febbH\u00fettH is presented. The measured value of this ratio is 0.2 \u00fe1.2 \u22120.5 . Following the approach and benchmarks recommended by the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [103], measurements of couplings are implemented using a leading-order tree-level-motivated framework. This framework is based on the following assumptions: (a) the central value of the ATLAS combined mass measurement of m H \u00bc 125.36 GeV is assumed; (b) the width of the Higgs boson is narrow, justifying the use of the zero-width approximation; and (c) only modifications of coupling strengths are considered, while the SM tensor structure is assumed, implying that the observed state is a CP-even scalar. The zero-width approximation allows the signal cross section to be decomposed in the following way: \u03c3 \u2022 B\u00f0i \u2192 H \u2192 f\u00de \u00bc \u03c3 i \u2022 \u0393 f =\u0393 H where \u03c3 i is the production cross section through the initial state i; B and \u0393 f are the branching ratio and partial decay width into the final state f, respectively; and \u0393 H the total width of the Higgs boson. This approach introduces scale factors applied to the Higgs boson coupling, \u03ba j , for particle j, which correspond to deviations from the SM Higgs coupling. For example, ggF production of the ZZ \u00c3 final state can be represented as \u03c3 \u2022 B\u00f0gg \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u00de \u00bc \u03c3 SM \u00f0gg \u2192 H\u00de\u2022 B SM \u00f0H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u00de \u2022 \u00f0\u03ba 2 g \u2022 \u03ba 2 Z \u00de=\u03ba 2 H , where \u03ba g , \u03ba Z , and \u03ba H are the scale factors for the Higgs couplings to g and Z, and a scale factor for the total Higgs width, respectively. Results are extracted from fits to the data using the profile likelihood ratio \u039b\u00f0\u03ba\u00de. In the fit, the \u03ba j are treated either as parameters of interest or as nuisance parameters, depending on the measurement.",
