The measurements utilize events of energies 2 < E\u03bd < 20 GeV, with E\u03bd = 8 GeV, which have a reconstructed \u00b5 \u2212 scattering angle less than 17 \u2022 to extract ratios of inclusive total cross sections as a function of neutrino energy E\u03bd and flux-integrated differential cross sections with respect to the Bjorken scaling variable x. These results provide the first high-statistics direct measurements of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering using different targets in the same neutrino beam. Measured cross section ratios exhibit a relative depletion at low x and enhancement at large x. Both become more pronounced as the nucleon number of the target nucleus increases. The data are not reproduced by GENIE, a conventional neutrino-nucleus scattering simulation, or by the alternative models for the nuclear dependence of inelastic scattering that are considered.",

Therefore, nuclear modifications of neutrino cross sections may differ from those of charged leptons [9][10][11][12]. An indirect extraction of neutrino deep inelastic structure function ratios using NuTeV Fe [13] and CHORUS Pb [14] data suggests this is the case [15]. If confirmed, this either challenges the validity of QCD factorization for processes involving bound nucleons or signals inconsistency between neutrino and charged lepton data. Another study [16] using different techniques does not find this behavior. Neutrino scattering data are necessary for separation of valence and sea quark contributions to parton distribution functions [15,17,18], but high-statistics data from iron and lead must be corrected to account for poorly measured nuclear modifications.",

So far, the only such measurements are ratios of Ne to D [19][20][21], but these are rarely used because of large statistical uncertainties and model-dependent extraction from a mixed H-Ne target. In this Letter, we report the first measurement of inclusive charged-current neutrino cross section ratios of C, Fe, and Pb to scintillator (CH) as functions of neutrino energy E \u03bd and x. This is the first application to neutrino physics of the EMC-style technique of measuring nuclear dependence with multiple nuclear targets in the same beam and detector.",

The MINERvA detector is comprised of 120 hexagonal modules perpendicular to the z axis, which is tilted 58 mrad upwards with respect to the beam line [23]. There are four module types: active tracking, electromagnetic calorimeter, hadronic calorimeter, and inactive nuclear target. The most upstream part of the detector includes five inactive targets, numbered from upstream to downstream, each separated by four active tracking modules. Target 4 is lead; other targets comprise two or three materials arranged at differing transverse positions filling the x \u2212 y plane. Targets 1, 2, and 5 are constructed of steel and lead plates joined together; target 3 has graphite, steel, and lead plates. Total fiducial masses of C, Fe, and Pb in the nuclear target region are 0.159, 0.628, and 0.711 tons, respectively. A fully active tracking region with a fiducial mass of 5.48 tons is downstream of the nuclear target region. The target and tracker regions are surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.

CH contamination is estimated by extrapolating event rates measured in the active tracking region to the nuclear target region. The tracking and nuclear target regions occupy different areas, and therefore have different acceptance into the MINOS detector. Further, the Fe and Pb targets in the nuclear target region stimulates greater activity in hadronic showers, which affects tracking efficiency. To account for the geometric acceptance difference, we apply a correction w t,A (E \u00b5 , \u03b8 \u00b5 ), obtained from a large, single-particle simulated \u00b5 \u2212 sample.

Uncertainty in flux is considered but negligible. All uncertainties are evaluated by repeating the cross section analysis with systematic shifts applied to simulation. Muon and recoil energy reconstruction uncertainties are described in Ref. [26] and Ref. [33], respectively. We evaluate systematic error from cross section and final state interaction models by varying underlying model parameters in GE-NIE within their uncertainties [27]. Since variations in model parameters affect calorimetric scale factors, these are reextracted during systematic error evaluation. Recoil energy and final state interaction model uncertainties increase with x, because interactions of lower energy hadrons are not as well constrained.

The excess observed here may be related to the excess in MI-NOS Fe data at low inelasticity compared to a simulation with nuclear corrections based on lighter nuclei similar to GENIE's [48,49]. The failure of nuclear scaling models in this region has profound implications for neutrino oscillation experiments that utilize quasielastic events. For example, T2K [50,51] must apply a nuclear model to relate the rate in the carbon of a near detector to oxygen in the far detector. LBNE [52] must extrapolate existing data on C, Fe, Pb to Ar. Until better models exist that cover the relevant kinematic domain, oscillation experiments must incorporate the discrepancies measured here in evaluating systematic uncertainties. More theoretical work is needed to correctly model nuclear effects in neutrino interactions, from the quasielastic to the deep inelastic regime.",
