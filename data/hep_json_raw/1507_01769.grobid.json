The selected events were identified using the lepton+jets top-quark-pair decay channel, where lepton refers to either an electron or a muon. The observed distribution is compared to a theoretical prediction at next-to-leading-order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics using the pole-mass scheme.

The only free parameters in the topquark sector of the SM are the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix and the top-quark mass. Due to its high value compared to the other quark masses, accurate knowledge of the top-quark mass is particularly relevant because it is related to the Higgs-boson and W -boson masses through radiative and loop corrections. The precise determination of these quantities allows a stringent test of whether the model is consistent [1,2]. In addition, the precise knowledge of the top-quark mass is a crucial ingredient in recent evaluations of the stability of the electroweak vacuum [3][4][5].",

A combination of a subset of these measurements yields a value of m t = 173.34 \u00b1 0.76 GeV [6]. In these measurements, the top-quark mass is inferred from a JHEP10(2015)121 kinematic reconstruction of the invariant mass of its decay products which is then calibrated to the mass definition used in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These m t determinations lack a clear interpretation in terms of a well-defined top-quark mass theoretical scheme as employed in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative calculations, electroweak fits or any theoretical prediction in general [2,[6][7][8][9]. The values extracted using these methods are usually identified with the top-quark pole mass m pole t , but present studies estimate differences between the two top-quark mass definitions of O(1) GeV [2,[6][7][8][9].",

With this method the top-quark mass scheme is unambiguously defined in the theoretical calculations. However, top-quark mass determinations based on cross-section measurements are less precise, in their current form, than the other techniques based on kinematic reconstruction. This is due to a relatively weak sensitivity of the inclusive top-quark pair production cross section to the top-quark mass, as well as to the large uncertainties on the factorization and renormalization scales and the proton parton distribution function (PDF). To date, the most precise measurement of this type is based on the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data samples collected by the ATLAS experiment during the years 2011 and 2012, which yields m pole t = 172.9 +2.5 \u22122.6 GeV [11].

Events are selected by using the \"lepton+jets\" final state to identify the tt system and at least one additional jet. In this channel one W from the top decay produces a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino whereas the other W produces a pair of light quarks. Events are thus required to have exactly one lepton, two jets identified as b-quark jets, at least three additional jets not identified as b-quark jets and a significant amount of missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) due to the neutrino that escapes detection. The differential cross section is corrected to the parton level (a procedure referred to as unfolding in the following) and normalized.

The inner tracking detector (ID) consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector (SCT), and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid which provides a 2 T magnetic field and by a high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic calorimeter. The electromagnetic calorimeter is divided into a central barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and end-cap regions at each end of the barrel (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 2.5 for the outer wheel and 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2 for the inner wheel). A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter completes the measurement of hadronic showers in the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7), while a LAr hadronic endcap calorimeter provides coverage over 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The forward regions (3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large air-core superconducting toroid systems providing bending powers of 3 Tm in the barrel and 6 Tm in the end-caps, a system of precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7), and fast detectors for triggering (|\u03b7| < 2.4). The combination of all these sub-detectors provides charged-particle measurements together with efficient and precise identification of leptons and photons in the pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2.5. Jets and E miss T are reconstructed using energy deposits over the full coverage of the calorimeters, |\u03b7| < 4.9. The reconstructed muon momenta are also included in the evaluation of E miss T . Evaluation of the luminosity scale is performed using several luminosity-sensitive detectors. The ATLAS experiment has a three-level trigger system [14]. The first-level trigger is hardware-based and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the event rate to at most 75 kHz. The second and third levels are software-based and together reduce the event rate to about 300 Hz.",

The production of W/Z bosons in association with jets (W +jets or Z+jets) is simulated using the ALPGEN generator (v2.13) [35] with the leading-order (LO) CTEQ6L1 [36] PDF set. These calculations are interfaced with Herwig 6 [37] for the parton shower and Jimmy v4.31 [38] for the underlying-event modelling. W +jets events containing heavyflavour quarks are generated separately using leading-order matrix elements with massive b-and c-quarks. Possible double-counting due to heavy quarks produced by the parton shower is considered and removed. The total number of W +jets events is normalized by exploiting the lepton charge asymmetry observed in data, following the method in ref. [39]. Diboson events (W W , ZZ, W Z) are generated using Herwig 6 with the MRSTMCal [40] PDF.
