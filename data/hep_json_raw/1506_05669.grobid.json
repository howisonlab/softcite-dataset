The investigations are based on 25 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV. The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson hypothesis, corresponding to the quantum numbers J P = 0 + , is tested against several alternative spin scenarios, including non-SM spin-0 and spin-2 models with universal and non-universal couplings to fermions and vector bosons. All tested alternative models are excluded in favour of the SM Higgs boson hypothesis at more than 99.9 % confidence level. Using the H \u2192 Z Z * \u2192 4 and H \u2192 W W * \u2192 e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd decays, the tensor structure of the interaction between the spin-0 boson and the SM vector bosons is also investigated. The observed distributions of variables sensitive to the non-SM tensor couplings are compatible with the SM predictions and constraints on the non-SM couplings are derived.",

Such cases may include CP-mixing in the Higgs boson interactions, which could result in observable differences in the kinematics of final-state particles produced in their decays.

Results on the same subject have also been published by the D0 and CDF Collaborations in Ref. [6]. All these studies indicate the compatibility of the spin and CP properties of the observed Higgs boson with the SM predictions. The ATLAS measurement excluded several alternative spin and parity hypotheses in favour of the quantum numbers predicted by the SM. In addition to the exclusion of several non-SM spin hypotheses, the CMS measurement probed the tensor structure of the Higgs boson decay to SM vector bosons in the spin-0 scenario. This paper complements the previous ATLAS study of the Higgs boson spin and parity. The new study takes advantage of improvements to the analysis strategy and to the modelling used to describe alternative spin hypotheses, and includes studies on CP-mixing for the spin-0 scenario. The improved theoretical framework is based on the Higgs boson characterisation model described in Refs. [3,7].",

A gas-filled straw-tube transition-radiation tracker (TRT) complements the silicon tracker at larger radii and also provides electron identification based on transition radiation. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with an accordion geometry. The EM calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end-cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5 it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. An additional thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in energy losses of particles before they reach the calorime-ter. Hadronic calorimetry in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers and scintillator tiles as the active medium. Liquid argon with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A forward calorimeter using copper or tungsten absorbers with liquid argon completes the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 4.9.

The muon spectrometer is also instrumented with dedicated trigger chambers, the resistive-plate chambers in the barrel and thin-gap chambers in the end-cap, covering |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

For large values of the BSM couplings, at the LHC energies, the VBF production mode can have a cross section that is comparable to the ggF process [16]. This study uses only kinematic properties of particles from H \u2192 V V * decays to derive information on the CP nature of the Higgs boson. The use of the signal rate information for different production modes, in the context of the EFT analysis, may increase the sensitivity to the BSM couplings at the cost of a loss in generality. For example the ratio of the VBF and V H production modes with respect to the ggF one can be changed by a large amount for non-vanishing values of the BSM couplings.

The EFT Lagrangian, however, also allows for more complex processes with emission of one or more additional partons. For instance, processes with one-parton emission, like qg \u2192 q X andqg \u2192q X, can produce a spin-2 state through either a qq X or a gg X vertex. When two partons are emitted, as in gg \u2192 qq X or qq \u2192 qq X, the spin-2 production may occur through qq X or gg X vertices, respectively, such that the polarisation of X is not uniquely determined by the initial state. Moreover, the EFT also allows for four-leg vertices like qqg X. These additional diagrams effectively change the polarisation of the particle X , compared to what is assumed by the model in Refs.

Presently, there are no experimental constraints on the ratio \u03ba q /\u03ba g from observed decay modes, since the separation of jets initiated by gluons or by light quarks is experimentally difficult and has not yet been attempted in Higgs boson studies. The ratio \u03ba q /\u03ba g can thus be regarded as a free parameter. When \u03ba q = \u03ba g , the spin-2 model predicts an enhancement of the tail of the distribution of the transverse momentum, p X T , of the spin-2 particle. Such a highp X T tail is not present for the \u03ba q = \u03ba g (UC) case. As stated before, however, the EFTs are valid only up to some energy scale, . At higher energies, new physics phenomena are expected to enter to regularise the anomalous ultra-violet behaviour.",

In addition, for the non-UC scenarios, analyses using a tighter selection p X T < 125 GeV are also performed. This is a conservative choice for the p X T selection, as the EFT must describe the physics at least up to the mass of the observed resonance. It has been verified that the choice of the p X T selection does not affect the results for the UC scenario. Even assuming the p X T < 300 GeV selection, some choices of \u03ba q /\u03ba g produce highp X T tails incompatible with the observed differential distribution reported in Refs. [21,22]. For this reason the investigated range of the \u03ba q /\u03ba g ratio is limited to between Table 2 Choices of the couplings to quarks \u03ba q and to gluons \u03ba g studied for the spin-2 benchmark scenarios. The values of the selection criteria applied to the transverse momentum p X T of the spin-2 resonance are also shown.

The distributions of the test statistic for both hypotheses are obtained using ensemble tests of MC pseudo-experiments. For each hypothesis test, about 70,000 pseudo-experiments were generated. The generation of the pseudo-experiments uses the numbers of signal and background events in each channel obtained from maximumlikelihood fits to data. In the fits of each pseudo-experiment, these and all other nuisance parameters are profiled, i.e. fitted to the value that maximises the likelihood for each value of the parameter of interest. When generating the distributions of the test statistic for a given spin-parity hypothesis, the expectation values of the signal strengths are fixed to those obtained in the fit to the data under the same spin-parity assumption. The distributions ofq are used to determine the corresponding p-values p(J P SM ) = p SM and p(J P alt ) = p alt .

During the offline selection two photons are further required to be in a fiducial pseudorapidity region, defined by |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, where the barrel/end-cap transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.56 is excluded.

In the following a brief summary is provided. The selection is restricted to events containing two charged leptons of different flavour (one electron and one muon). The e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd channel is the most sensitive one [19]. The sameflavour channels (e\u03bde\u03bd and \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd) are not expected to add much in terms of sensitivity due to the presence of large backgrounds that cannot be removed without greatly reducing the acceptance of the alternative models considered in this analysis. The leading lepton is required to have p T > 22 GeV and to match the object reconstructed by the trigger, while the sub-leading lepton needs to have p T > 15 GeV. While the spin-0 analyses select only events with no jets in the final state (no observed jets with p T > 25 GeV within |\u03b7| < 2.5 or with p T > 30 GeV within 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.5), the spin-2 analysis enlarges the acceptance by allowing for zero or one jet (selected according to the above mentioned criteria). The major sources of background after the dilepton selection are Z /\u03b3 * +jets (Drell-Yan) events, diboson (W W, W Z/\u03b3 * , Z Z/\u03b3 * ), top-quark (tt and single top) production, and W bosons produced in association with hadronic jets (W +jets), where a jet is misidentified as a lepton. The contribution from misidentified leptons is significantly reduced by the requirement of two highp T isolated leptons. Drell-Yan events are suppressed through requirements on some of the dilepton variables 4 ( p T > 20 GeV, \u03c6 < 2.8), while a cut on m (m < 80 GeV) targets the W W background. For alternative spin models with non-universal couplings, as discussed in Sect. 3, an additional upper bound is imposed on the Higgs boson p T , reconstructed as the transverse component of the vector sum of the momenta of the two charged leptons and the missing transverse momentum. Additionally, for events containing one jet, which include substantial topquark and W +jets backgrounds, b-jet and Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 vetoes are applied, together with transverse mass requirements: the larger of the transverse masses of the two W bosons (each computed using the corresponding lepton and the missing transverse momentum) in the event is required to be larger than 50 GeV, while the total transverse mass of the W W system (defined with the two leptons and the missing transverse momentum) is required to be below 150 GeV.",

No background component is involved in this case. The variables used for the BDT CP trainings are m , \u03c6 , p T and the missing transverse momentum for the CP-even analysis and m , \u03c6 , E \u03bd\u03bd and p T for the CP-odd analysis. The training strategy is different from the one used in the spin-2 analysis because, while the spin-2 signal is very similar to the background, the spin-0 signals are all similar to each other, while being different from the main background components. Therefore, in the latter case, training the signal hypotheses against each other improves the sensitivity.

The main improvement with respect to the previous ATLAS publication of Ref. [4] is the introduction of a BDT discriminant designed to optimise the separation between the signal and the most relevant background process. Events containing four reconstructed leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state are selected using single-lepton and dilepton triggers. The selected events are classified according to their final state: 4\u03bc, 2e2\u03bc, 2\u03bc2e and 4e, where for the decay modes 2e2\u03bc and 2\u03bc2e the first pair is defined to be the one with the dilepton mass closest to the Z boson mass. Each muon (electron) must satisfy p T > 6 GeV ( p T > 7 GeV) and be measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.7 (|\u03b7| < 2.47). Higgs boson candidates are formed by selecting two same-flavour, opposite-charge lepton pairs in an event. The lepton with the highest p T in the quadruplet must have p T > 20 GeV, and the leptons with the second-and third-highest p T must have p T > 15 GeV and p T >10 GeV, respectively. The lepton pair with the mass closest to the Z boson mass is referred to as the leading lepton pair and its invariant mass as m 12 . The requirement 50 GeV < m 12 < 106 GeV is applied. The other lepton pair is chosen from the remaining leptons as the pair closest in mass to the Z boson. Its mass, denoted hereafter by m 34 , must satisfy 12 GeV < m 34 < 115 GeV. Further requirements are made on the impact parameters of the leptons relative to the interaction vertex and their isolation in both the tracker and calorimeter.",

The method of the matrix-element-observable fit is based on modelling the distributions of the final-state observables in each bin of coupling ratios using Monte Carlo simulation. Using the Lagrangian defined in Eq. (1), which is linear in the coupling constants \u03ba SM , \u03ba H V V and \u03ba AV V , the differential cross section at each point in the phase space can be expressed as a term corresponding to the SM amplitude, plus two additional terms, linear and quadratic in the coupling constants. In this way it is possible to define two observables for each coupling, the so-called first-and second-order optimal observables, upon which the amplitude depends at each point of the phase space. For each event, they contain the full kinematic information about the couplings, which can thus be extracted from a fit to their shapes. More details of the method can be found in Refs. [39][40][41][42].",

            "text": "The results of the matrix-element-observable fit were validated and cross-checked using a nine-dimensional matrixelement method (9D fit). The method implements a multivariate per-event extended likelihood that is sensitive to both the\u03ba H V V /\u03ba SM and (\u03ba AV V /\u03ba SM ) \u2022 tan \u03b1 mixing parameters and is based on nine experimental observables. The probability model is constructed with separate components for signal, the SM Z Z * background and the reducible background. The background components are assumed to be independent of the Higgs boson tensor structure, so all of the sensitivity to The main sources of systematic uncertainty for the tensor structure measurements are the same as discussed in Sect. 5 since they are based on the same four-lepton variables. Several additional sources of uncertainty, specific to each of the methods, are also taken into account. For the matrix-element-observable fit, the uncertainty related to the Kernel Density Estimation smoothing procedure applied to signal and background multi-dimensional histograms is considered. To estimate the influence of this uncertainty on the final result, a procedure similar to the one described in Sect. 5 is employed. The impact of the different sources of systematic uncertainty on the final results is evaluated by comparing the BSM exclusion limits obtained with a specific systematic uncertainty included or excluded in the fit, while excluding all other systematic uncertainties. A similar conclusion holds in the fixed hypothesis test: the systematic uncertainties have a very limited impact on the final result. The most important uncertainties are related to the estimates of the reducible backgrounds. The relative impact of these uncertainties on the final 95 % CL exclusion limit on BSM couplings was found to be around \u00b11 %. The second most important group of sources of systematic uncertainty is related to the theoretical uncertainties on the production cross section of the Z Z * background process. Their relative impact on the final result is found to be less than \u00b11 %. The precision of the tensor structure analysis is thus dominated by the statistical errors. In this paper, only results based on the matrix-elementobservable approach are reported. The 9D approach was used as a cross-check and produced results compatible with the matrix-element approach.",

The SM Higgs boson hypothesis, corresponding to the quantum numbers J P = 0 + , is tested against several alternative spin and parity models. The models considered include non-SM spin-0 and spin-2 models with universal and non-universal couplings to quarks and gluons. The combination of the three decay processes allows the exclusion of all considered non-SM spin hypotheses at a more than 99.9 % CL in favour of the SM spin-0 hypothesis.",
