Heavy ion collisions (A+A) are an integral part of the LHC physics program. The first four-week run with Pb beams took place in November 2010 at a centreof-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon. About 10 \u00b5b \u22121 of integrated luminosity were delivered to each of the three LHC experiments which take part in the heavy ion program, the two general purpose detectors ATLAS [2] and CMS [3] as well as the dedicated heavy ion detector ALICE [4,5]. This review summarises the results from the first year of ion physics at the LHC, focusing on global event properties, high p T and heavy quark physics, and the production of hidden heavy flavour mesons (J/\u03c8, \u03d2).",

General arguments based on the property of asymptotic freedom suggest, and quantitative calculations of lattice quantum chromodynamics confirm [6,7,8], that QCD matter undergoes a transition from a hadronic gas to a quark-gluon plasma at a temperature T c \u2248 160 MeV, corresponding to an energy density of \u03b5 c \u2248 0.5 GeV/fm 3 . At small net baryon density, the transition is a smooth cross-over spanning a temperature range of 20 \u2212 30 MeV, which means that the precise value of the pseudo-critical temperature T c depends on the observable used to locate it. The quark-gluon plasma phase is characterized by a much reduced condensate of light quarks, reflecting the approximate restoration of chiral symmetry, and by screening of the chromo-electric force between heavy quarks, implying the absence of quark confinement. At high net baryon density, the confined and deconfined phases are thought to be separated by a first-order phase transition, beginning with a critical point whose position is not accurately known.",

            "text": "A large body of experimental and theoretical research conducted over the past decades at AGS, SPS, and RHIC has led to the following \"standard model\" of heavy ion collisions at collider energies [9,10]. The energy deposited in the mid-rapidity kinematic range is controlled by the density of gluons contained in the colliding nuclei at moderately small values of the Bjorken scaling variable x [11]. At top RHIC collision energy the relevant range is x \u2248 10 \u22122 , while at the current LHC energy the value is x \u2248 10 \u22123 . In this range of x the gluon density obeys a highly nonlinear evolution equation that describes the saturation of the rapidly growing perturbative gluon distribution at low virtuality [12]. The virtuality scale at which this saturation occurs is called the saturation scale Q s . At present collider energies and for heavy nuclei Q 2 s \u2248 1.5 \u2212 2 GeV 2 at RHIC and Q 2 s \u2248 3 \u2212 4 GeV 2 at LHC [13]. The liberation of the dense gluon sea by interactions during the collision of two nuclei is thought to result in the formation of a dense, non-thermal QCD plasma with highly occupied gauge field modes, often called a \"glasma\" [14]. The glasma thermalizes rapidly through nonlinear interactions including plasma instabilities [15,16]. During the longest phase of the heavy ion reaction the QCD matter forms a nearly thermal quark-gluon plasma, whose evolution can be described accurately by relativistic viscous hydrodynamics because of its very small kinematic shear viscosity. The temperature of the plasma at the time of thermalization is approximately 2T c ; it cools by mainly longitudinal expansion until it converts to a gas of hadron resonances when its temperature falls below T c . At that temperature the chemical composition of the produced hadrons gets frozen, but the spectral distribution of the hadrons is still modified by final-state interactions, which are modelled by a Boltzmann transport equation.",

Such a small ratio requires that the interactions among the constituent quanta are extremely strong and the cross sections among them approach the unitarity limit [18]. This picture is supported by QCD lattice simulations, which show that the QCD matter in the temperature range T c \u2264 T \u2264 2T c is highly nonperturbative as witnessed, e. g., by the large value of the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, T \u00b5 \u00b5 = \u03b5 \u2212 3P [7]. The strongly coupled nature of the quark-gluon plasma created in the heavy ion reaction is confirmed by its ability to \"quench\" jets. At RHIC, the two main observables revealing this property are the suppression of single hadron yields at high transverse momentum p T relative to pp reactions and the additional suppression of back-to-back emission of high-p T hadrons. The ratios quantifying these suppressions are known as R AA and I AA , respectively. Compelling arguments related the suppression effects to the ability of the quark-gluon plasma to degrade the kinetic energy of a hard parton (quark or gluon) traversing it, either by elastic collisions or collisions followed by gluon bremsstrahlung. The large values of the energy loss rate of hard partons deduced from the RHIC data [19] are consistent with the low shear viscosity deduced from the collective flow pattern of low-momentum hadrons [20].",

Questions of particular interest were whether the increase in the initial temperature of the quark-gluon plasma would result in a much more viscous expansion of the created matter, and whether the gluon saturation effects in the colliding nuclei would be so strong that they significantly reduce, not only the expected density of the glasma, but also the yield of particles at moderately large p T . Because of the much higher beam energy and the large acceptance of the LHC detectors, heavy ion collisions at the LHC were also expected to provide access to new observables measuring the pattern of jet quenching and extend our knowledge of the interaction of heavy quarks and heavy quarkonia with hot QCD matter. An extensive compilation of theoretical predictions made before the commencement of the LHC heavy ion program can be found in [21].",

When the LHC heavy ion program was conceived and detectors had to be designed more than a decade ago, predictions for dN ch /d\u03b7 were highly uncertain, ranging from below 1000 to above 4500, because experimental results had to be extrapolated from light ions at low energy (Sulphur beams at \u221a s = 20 GeV) by orders of magnitude in both ion mass and beam energy [22,23]. With results from RHIC, the uncertainties where substantially reduced, with most predictions concentrating in the range dN ch /d\u03b7 = 1000 \u2212 1700 [21]. The value finally measured at LHC, dN ch /d\u03b7 \u2248 1600 [24], was on the high side of this range. From the measured multiplicity one can derive a rough estimate of the energy density with the help of a formula first proposed by Bjorken [25] relating the energy density to the transverse energy:  where \u03c4 0 denotes the thermalization time, R is the nuclear radius, and E T /N \u2248 1 GeV is the transverse energy per emitted particle. The value measured at the LHC implies that the initial energy density (at \u03c4 0 = 1 fm/c) is about 15 GeV/fm 3 [26], approximately a factor three higher than in Au+Au collisions at the top energy of RHIC [27,28,29,30,10]. The corresponding initial temperature increases by at least 30% to T \u2248 300 MeV, even with the conservative assumption that the formation time \u03c4 0 , when thermal equilibrium is first established, remains the same as at RHIC.",

Events are classified according to \"centrality\", where e.g. the 0-5% centrality bin contains the 5% of all hadronic interaction events with the largest final-state multiplicity and therefore the smallest impact parameters. Correspondingly, the 90-100% centrality bin comprises the 10% of events with the smallest final-state multiplicity and the largest impact parameters. The experimentally measured centrality can be related analytically or via a probabilistic Glauber Monte-Carlo generator to the number of participating nucleons N part which are contained in the nuclear overlap volume for a given centrality class and therefore take part in the collision [31]. Likewise one can extract the number of nucleonnucleon collisions N coll between the participants. For Pb+Pb at LHC, the centrality or N part resolution varies from about 0.5% for central (N part \u2248 400) to about 5% for peripheral (N part < 10) events [32,33,34].",

Particle production is no longer compatible with a logarithmic dependence with \u221a s, as it was true for the data up to top RHIC energy [37], but follows a power law \u2248 s 0.15 .

Comparison to the averaged and scaled 200 GeV Au+Au data (from [35], updated using more recent STAR [36] and PHOBOS [37] data) shows a remarkable similarity in the shape of both distributions. For peripheral collisions, however, both distributions extrapolate towards respective values measured in pp inelastic collisions (N part = 2) at 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV and therefore start to separate because of the different energy dependence seen for pp and A+A in Fig. 1a.",

It was still a surprise that it stays almost constant up to TeV energies, because hard processes, which scale with the number of binary collisions N coll , could be expected to contribute significantly to particle production at LHC and lead to a steeper centrality dependence, as predicted by the two component (soft + hard) Dual Parton Model DPMJET [38] (dotted line in Fig. 1b). However, a strong impact parameter dependent shadowing of the nuclear parton distribution function can limit this rise with centrality and is responsible for the flatter shape seen in the two component model HIJING [39], which agrees better with the data (full line). Saturation physics based on the \"Colour Glass Condensate\" (CGC) description [40], an example [41] is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 1b, naturally predicts such a strong nuclear modification, as well as the strong rise of particle production as a function of \u221a s seen in Fig. 1a. In saturation models, the energy dependence is predicted to be a power law with roughly the correct exponent, whereas the centrality dependence changes only weakly (logarithmically) with the saturation scale and therefore the beam energy.",

            "text": "In pp collisions at high energy, the transverse momentum distribution can be separated into an exponentially decreasing low p T part (< few GeV/c), arising from soft, nonpertubative processes, and a powerlaw high p T tail from hard QCD scattering and fragmentation. A defining characteristic of heavy ion collisions is the appearance of ordered motion amongst the emitted hadrons in the soft part of the momentum spectrum [45,46]. It is called collective flow and implies, in contrast to random thermal motion, a strong correlation between position and momentum variables (nearby particles have similar velocities in both magnitude and direction). Flow arises in a strongly interacting medium in the presence of local pressure gradients. Different flow patterns are observed in heavy ion collisions and classified in terms of their azimuthal angle \u03d5 dependence with respect to the reaction plane, i. e. the plane spanned by the beam direction and the impact parameter. The isotropic (or angle averaged) component is called radial flow. In the framework of hydrodynamic models, the fluid properties (viscosity, equation-of-state, speed of sound, ..) together with boundary conditions both in the initial state (collision geometry, pressure gradients, ..) and in the final state (freeze-out conditions) determine the pattern of collective motions and the resulting momentum spectra d 2 N/dp T d\u03d5. Fig. 2a shows the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles in central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [47,48]. The spectral shapes differ significantly from both pp at LHC and Au+Au at RHIC, most dramatically for protons at low p T . The characteristic mass-dependent blue shift generated by the radial flow leads to a strong depletion at low p T -the proton spectrum is almost flat between 0.5 and 1.5 GeV/c -and to a harder spectrum at high p T , where the p/\u03c0 ratio reaches a value of close to unity around 3 GeV/c. The data are compared to hydrodynamic calculations, which are normalised to the data individually for each particle species in order to better compare the shapes (absolute particle yields and ratios, which are an external input to the hydro models, are discussed below). The dashed line (VISH2+1) is a pure hydro calculation [49,50,51] for \u039e and \u2126 (0-20% centrality); the full line (VISHNU) for \u03c0, K, p (0-5% centrality) includes additional final-state rescattering, calculated with the URQMD transport code, which increases the radial flow velocity and improves the agreement with the data [52]. The hydro model describes the data fairly well up to intermediate momenta. Around 2 GeV/c, first pions and later protons start to deviate from the exponential hydro slope, indicating a progressive decoupling of high momentum particles from the thermalized and flowing bulk matter.",

            "text": "The radial flow velocity can be estimated by fitting the spectra with a hydrodynamically inspired function called a \"blastwave\" fit [53]. The resulting kinetic freeze-out temperatures T f o and average radial flow velocities \u03b2 are shown in Fig. 2b for different centrality selections [47]. Quantitative results from such fits have to be taken with caution, as they in general depend on the particle types and momentum ranges included in the fit. The two fit parameters (T f o , \u03b2 ) are strongly correlated as indicated by the confidence contours in Fig. 3a (each confidence contour corresponds to a different centrality class). However, a relative comparison to a similar fit to RHIC data [30] shows for the most central collisions that the average flow velocity increases significantly at LHC, reaching about 0.65c -the leading edge of the fireball expands collectively at essentially the speed of light -and that the kinetic freeze-out temperature drops below the one at RHIC. . Like the p/\u03c0 ratio mentioned above, the \u039b/K 0 S ratio is strongly enhanced compared to pp, reaching a maximum of \u2248 1.5 around 3 GeV/c. Both the maximum value as well as its position in p T change only modestly compared to RHIC, where these unusual baryon to meson ratios had been observed previously and were referred to as \"baryon anomaly\" [55,56,57]. However, unlike at RHIC, the enhancement for central collisions of roughly a factor of three relative to the pp value persists out to at least 6 GeV/c. Qualitatively such an enhancement is expected from radial flow (the heavier baryons are pushed further out in p T than the lighter mesons), as shown by the full line, which represents the \u039b/K 0 S extracted from the hydro model VISH2+1 already shown in Fig. 2a. Quantitatively, however, the measured shape is very different indicating a progressive decoupling of hadrons from pure hydrodynamic flow above 2 GeV/c (see Fig. 2a). Global observables like momentum spectra, particle ratios and anisotropic flow seem to be governed by collective and thermal processes below p T < 2 \u2212 3 GeV/c, whereas hard processes and fragmentation dominate above p T > 6 \u2212 10 GeV/c. In the  intermediate momentum region, various mechanisms have been proposed to describe the interplay between soft and hard processes, including coalescence (recombination) of constituent quarks [58], strong colour fields with enhanced baryon transport [59], and colour transparency [60]. The dashed line shows \u039b/K 0 S calculated in a recombination model [58] where radial flow and jet-quenching have been adjusted to the measured data at LHC; it describes the shape of the distribution above \u2248 3 GeV/c very well but is slightly off in normalisation (the model in the figure has been scaled by 0.85). A quantitative understanding at intermediate momenta remains a challenge and will require additional experimental constraints, in particular high precision data on identified particles out to at least 10 GeV/c.",

            "text": "Bulk particle production can be very successfully described in the framework of the thermal (statistical) hadronisation model [42,43]. It assumes that particles are created in thermal (phase space) equilibrium governed by a scale parameter T, interpreted as a temperature. Production of a particle with mass m is suppressed by a Boltzmann factor e \u2212m/T . Conservation laws introduce additional constraints, like the baryochemical potential \u00b5 B which accounts for baryon number conservation. An additional parameter \u03b3 s is introduced to describe the observation that in some collision systems particles containing strange quarks are suppressed compared to the grand canonical thermal expectation. The temperature parameter is found in all high energy collisions (pp, e + e \u2212 , A+A) to be about 160 -170 MeV, while \u03b3 s increases from 0.5 \u2212 0.6 in pp to 0.9 \u2212 1 in A+A [61,62]. The disappearance of strangeness suppression in nuclear collisions [63,64], usually called strangeness enhancement, was one of the first signals predicted for the QGP [65], and the fact that the bulk of all particles are produced in heavy ion reactions with thermal ratios to very good approximation (typically < 10-20%) is considered to be an essential and well established fact. Fig. 3b shows a number of particle ratios from central Pb+Pb collisions, together with the (particle antiparticle averaged) values measured in pp at 7 TeV [47,66], as well as the prediction from a thermal model using the canonical conditions expected for nuclear collisions at the LHC [67]. Within experimental errors, particles and anti-particles are produced in Pb+Pb at midrapidity in equal numbers, consistent with the very small value of the baryochemical potential \u00b5 B of the thermal model. Strangeness is enhanced in Pb+Pb compared to pp, by a factor which increases with strangeness content from about 1.3 in K/\u03c0 to up to > 3 in \u2126/\u03c0 (note that the pp data in Fig. 3b correspond to a higher energy than the Pb+Pb data). All strange particle ratios in Pb+Pb are very well described by the model, implying that they are produced in accordance with fully thermal ratios (i.e. \u03b3 S = 1). However, in a complete surprise, protons were found  to be strikingly off -too low by a factor of about 1.5 -and well outside the usual precision of the thermal model. The p/\u03c0 ratio, which would have been expected to increase from its value measured in pp, stays essentially unchanged or even decreases slightly.",

Also the proton ratios at RHIC should be revisited, as there are indications of a smaller, but still significant, tension between model fits and data [68]. If the anomaly persists and cannot be described with extensions to the standard thermal model [69,70], it may be due to inelastic processes which can change the particle composition after hadronisation. This mechanism is already thought to be responsible for the abundance of resonances with a large width and therefore a large hadronic cross section (like \u03c1 and K * ), but hard to describe quantitatively because of partially unknown cross sections and the difficulty to account for multi-particle initial states in hadronic transport codes.",

For identical bosons (fermions), quantum statistics leads to an enhancement (depletion) for particles emitted close-by in phase space. This modifies the two-particle correlation function, measured in energy and momentum variables, and can be related via a Fourier transformation to the space and time distribution of the emitting source, i.e. the space-time hyper surface of last rescattering.",

The total freeze-out volume is given as the product of a geometrical factor and the radii measured in three orthogonal directions (called R long , R side , and R out ), whereas the lifetime was estimated from the pair-momentum dependence of R long . The locally comoving freeze-out volume is directly proportional to the particle multiplicity ( Fig. 4a) and therefore increases by a factor two compared to top RHIC energy to about 5000 fm 3 . The system lifetime is proportional to the cube root of the particle density ( Fig. 4b) and increases by about 30% to 10 fm/c. Incidentally, the freeze-out volume roughly extrapolates at low beam energy to the volume of a Pb nucleus (\u2248 800 fm 3 ) and the lifetime vanishes at zero particle density. The evolution from RHIC to LHC of the individual radius parameters (R long , R side , R out ) as well as their pair momen-tum dependence is in satisfactory agreement with the predictions of hydrodynamical models [21,72]. The stronger transverse flow generated during the hydrodynamic phase at LHC energy reduces the importance of pre-equilibrium flow, in comparison with RHIC, and thus makes the agreement with the hydrodynamical predictions less dependent on extraneous assumptions [73].",

This prediction was quickly confirmed [83]: the p T differential flow for charged particles is essentially unchanged at LHC whereas the p T integrated flow increases by some 30%, a direct consequence of the stronger radial flow discussed above. The matter created at LHC therefore still behaves like the (almost) perfect liquid discovered at RHIC.",

An example on the experimental side are non-flow correlations introduced e.g. by jets and resonance decays. On the theory side, uncertainties arise from model assumptions made about the initial state pressure gradients and their event-by-event fluctuations. It was in fact only recently realized [84,85] that the statistical nature of individual nucleon-nucleon collisions can lead to highly irregular shapes of the reaction zone and the corresponding initial energy/pressure distributions. These shapes fluctuate from one event to the next, even at a fixed impact parameter. The irregular pressure gradients show no symmetry with respect to the reaction plane and therefore induce higher harmonic flow patterns. Fluctuations also tilt the symmetry angle of v 2 away from the geometrical reaction plane (\u03a8 2 = \u03a8 RP ), leading to event-by-event fluctuations of the elliptic flow direction and magnitude.",

The agreement between the LHC experiments [86,87,88,89,90,91] is again remarkable. Making use of the large rapidity acceptance of the LHC detectors, the coefficients v n were measured by methods that minimize the influence of non-flow correlations, which are dominantly shortrange in rapidity (2P = trigger di-hardon correlations, EP = Event Plane, SP = two-particle cumulant with eta-gap; see [45]). The elliptic flow coefficient rises approximately linearly with p T to a maximum of v 2 \u2248 0.23 around 3 GeV/c. The corresponding asymmetry in dN/d\u03d5 is very large indeed: almost three times as many 3 GeV/c particles are emitted in-plane compared to out-of-plane (see eq 2). The coefficient then decreases, at first rapidly then more gradually, but stays finite out to the highest p T measured. Also the triangular flow coefficient is very significant out to about 10 GeV/c and similar in shape, reaching about half the value of v 2 at the maximum. At high p T , where spectral shapes and relative particle yields indicate that hadrons are no longer in local thermal equilibrium, the nonzero v 2 is thought to arise from differential parton energy loss rather than collective flow. The energy loss should depend on the path length inside the matter and therefore correlate naturally with the orientation of the elongated reaction zone.",

The effect of a nonvanishing viscosity is clearly visible: The initial pressure gradients are dissipated and the resulting collective flow is reduced. The influence of viscosity is seen to be much stronger on v 3 , as expected. The triangularity corresponds to shorter wavelength density variations and therefore larger local pressure gradients, which are more sensitive to viscosity. While both values of the viscosity are compatible with the v 2 results, only 4\u03c0\u03b7/s = 1 describes v 3 . A larger value of the viscosity would fall significantly below the v 3 data, but could in principle be accommodated by using a different model for the initial state which generates a larger pressure gradient. This is illustrated in Fig. 5b, which shows the p T integrated flow as a function of centrality [86]. The elliptic flow rises strongly towards peripheral collisions, following the increasing elongation of the reaction region. Because of event-by-event fluctuations v 2 stays non-zero even for the most central collisions. The triangular flow shows little centrality dependence, as it is driven solely by shape fluctuations. The hydrodynamic model [82] shown in Fig. 5b employs two different, frequently used sets of initial conditions. The energy density distribution in the transverse plane is taken either from a Glauber calculation (solid line) combined with 4\u03c0\u03b7/s = 1, or from a saturation model (dashed line) combined with 4\u03c0\u03b7/s = 2. The latter predicts larger pressure gradients and consequently needs a larger viscosity to describe the v 2 data. However, the saturation model significantly underpredicts v 3 . Glauber initial conditions can describe both v 2 and v 3 better, in particular, if flow fluctuations are taken into account (see [82] for details).",

The LHC data for v 2 for various particles (\u03c0, K, p, \u039e, \u2126) are shown in Fig. 6a [100, 101]. To understand the origin of the characteristic mass splitting, seen also in v 3 [100], one needs to keep in mind that collective radial flow tends to equalise the velocities of particles, not their momenta, and therefore shifts heavy particles out to higher p T than light ones [102]. The effect of a given azimuthal flow asymmetry thus manifests itself at higher momenta for particles with a larger mass. The hydrodynamical model [95,94], which incorporates this effect, describes the data very well for all particle species up to intermediate p T . It also predicted the observation that the mass splitting is larger at LHC than at RHIC as a consequence of the increased radial flow.",

The different behaviour of mesons and baryons, also seen in RHIC data [27,28,29,30,10], has been interpreted as a sign of quark recombination or coalescence [103,104,105,106], already mentioned above as a possible reason for the large baryon-to-meson ratios. In this picture, hadrons at intermediate p T of a few GeV/c are formed by coalescence of constituent quarks from deconfined quark matter, with the threequark baryons receiving a proportionally larger share of the collective quark flow than the two-quark mesons. Indeed, RHIC data indicate a universal scaling of flow [107] for all particles of mass m when plotting v 2 /n q versus (m T \u2212 m)/n q ), where n q is the number of constituent quarks (n q = 2 or 3) and (m T \u2212 m) is the transverse kinetic energy (m T = p 2 T + m 2 ).",

No scaling is apparent for p T < 1.5 GeV/c, where all particles follow more closely the mass dependent pattern predicted by hydrodynamics (see Fig. 6a). It therefore seems that the empirically observed low p T \"quark scaling\" at RHIC is a coincidence, only approximately valid for a particular value of the radial flow and the corresponding mass splitting. At higher p T , quark scaling between mesons and baryons may hold at LHC within the current experimental errors, but is definitely less convincing so far. Reduced errors and a measurement of flow for the \u03c6 , a meson with a mass comparable to the proton, are required before a strong case for the coalescence picture can be made with LHC flow results.",

What is the relative contribution of radiative and elastic mechanisms of energy loss? How does the energy loss depend on the thickness of the medium? Strongly coupled gauge theories generally predict a stronger dependence on the path length in the medium than perturbative QCD [110]. Where does the lost energy go? Does it remain inside the jet cone and manifest itself as a modification of the fragmentation function, or does it get rapidly thermalized in the medium, making the jet look like a jet in vacuum, but with reduced energy?",

The inclusive charged particle R AA follows, up to about 10 \u2212 15 GeV/c, the characteristic shape discovered at RHIC (left panel, full circles). The pronounced maximum at a few GeV/c, which is sometimes attributed to initial or final state interactions in nuclei (\"Cronin effect\"), is at very high energies more likely to be yet another manifestation of collective flow. It is qualitatively described by the dashed line, which shows the R AA obtained by dividing the inclusive charged particle distribution calculated by viscous hydrodynamics [50] for central Pb+Pb by the experimentally measured pp spectrum. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the apparent \"suppression\" factor is slightly larger for kaons and significantly larger for the \u039b, as expected from flow. The peak region is followed by a steep decline and a minimum, around 5 \u2212 7 GeV/c, where the suppression reaches a factor of about seven, very similar to but slightly larger than the one measured at RHIC. the decay of bottom quarks, closed diamond) in Fig. 7, are almost as strongly suppressed as inclusive charged particles. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the measurement of leptons from heavy flavour decays [115]. This seems contrary to the expectation that gluons, which are the dominant source of inclusive charged particles at LHC, should suffer twice as much energy loss as light quarks and that, in addition, the energy loss of heavy quarks should be even less than that of light quarks because of the mass dependence of radiation (\"dead-cone\" effect [109]). The strong suppression found for hadrons containing cand b-quarks confirms observations made at RHIC and may indicate that the energy loss rate depends less strongly on the parton mass than expected for radiative energy loss. Reasons for this behaviour could be nonperturbatively large elastic energy loss in the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma or heavy meson formation within the medium [124]. More data and a quantitative comparison with models will be required to see how the small, with current statistics not very significant, difference between light hadron and heavy quark suppression can be accommodated by theory.",

The value ofq is proportional to the density of gluons in the medium and grows approximately as the entropy density of the plasma, or the charged particle multiplicity in the final state of the heavy ion collision.

These differences can be further enhanced by the use of different models for the medium evolution. Nevertheless, the quantitative success of several models in correctly reproducing the rise and saturation of R AA with p T suggests that the energy loss of the leading parton in a jet shower may be described by perturbative QCD radiation in a strongly coupled medium.",

Measuring the energy of fully reconstructed jets allows one to distinguish between energy redistribution among the leading parton and the remainder of the jet and energy dissipation out of the jet into the thermal medium. One of the promising channels are dijets, in particular their transverse energy balance and azimuthal angle correlation. The energy dissipation into the medium can be studied by measuring the asymmetry in p T of dijets in heavy ion collisions as a function of centrality and by comparing them to data from pp collisions. Similarly, the measurement of the relative azimuthal angle of the two jet axes gives information about the degree of scattering of partons as they traverse the medium.",

This suggests that most of the additional energy radiated by the leading parton inside the medium gets absorbed by the matter, and the fragments observed within the jet cone are produced outside of the medium. Several model calculations [133,134,135,136], which combine elastic and inelastic parton energy loss with deflection of radiated gluons by the medium, have been able to reproduce the increased energy asymmetry of dijets in Pb+Pb. The strong effect of jet quenching is confirmed by the ATLAS measurement of the jet R CP [131]. The comparison of jet production cross section between the central and peripheral events indicates that for the most central events the energy loss appears to reduce the cross section by about a factor of two (see Fig. 10). This shows that the energy lost by the leading parton is not simply redistributed within the jet cone but lost from the reconstructed jet.  To find the \"missing energy\", the calorimetric measurement in CMS was complemented by a detailed study of low p T charged particles in the tracker and by using missing p T techniques. The apparent missing energy in highly unbalanced dijet events was found among the low p T particles, predominantly with 0.5 < p T < 2 GeV/c, emitted outside of the sub-leading jet cone [130].",

This could indicate suppression of only the high mass charmonium states \u03c8' and \u03c7 c , which populate about 40% of the observed J/\u03c8, and which should dissociate very close to or even below the critical transition temperature. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the increasing (with energy) J/\u03c8 suppression is more or less balanced by enhanced production via recombination of two independently produced charm quarks [143,144]. A resolution to this puzzle may come from measuring J/\u03c8 production at the LHC where coalescence effects should be stronger because of the abundant charm production, and by comparing the suppression patterns of the J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 families.",

The p T integrated R AA measured for the J/\u03c8 at forward rapidity (closed circles) of about 0.5 depends very little on centrality and is almost a factor of two larger than the one measured at RHIC in central collisions, also at forward rapidity (open circles); the difference is smaller but still significant when comparing with RHIC midrapidity data (open squares). On the contrary, the high p T data at LHC (full squares), which is compatible with an independent R CP measurement [119], show a stronger suppression than the high p T RHIC results (open stars). While such a pattern would be unexpected in a pure suppression scenario, it is qualitatively consistent with the recombination model, which predicts substantial regeneration effects only at low transverse momentum. The \u03d2 suppression (right panel) is very similar at RHIC and LHC. As only about 50% of the observed \u03d2(1S) are directly produced, and the \u03d2(2S/3S) states seem to be more suppressed than the ground state [148], the measured R AA is compatible at both RHIC and LHC with suppression of the high mass bottonium states only.",

Global event properties were found to evolve smoothly from RHIC to LHC, to be qualitatively similar but quantitatively different, and to reflect the expected increases in energy density, volume, and lifetime of the hot and dense matter created in the collisions. The data have generally confirmed that also at LHC energy the bulk features imply the formation of a very strongly interacting, nearly perfect quark-gluon plasma liquid. The prominent presence of various collective flow patterns has opened a path forward to precision measurements of its material properties, including shear viscosity, equation-of-state, and sound velocity.",

While its magnitude is roughly in the expected range, the more differential analysis of parton type and momentum dependence, dijet correlations, and energy flow around the jet axis has revealed features which were not anticipated and may spur substantial refinements of our understanding and modelling of parton interactions with the hot QCD medium.",

Like the p/\u03c0 ratio mentioned above, the \u039b/K 0 S ratio is strongly enhanced compared to pp, reaching a maximum of \u2248 1.5 around 3 GeV/c. Both the maximum value as well as its position in p T change only modestly compared to RHIC, where these unusual baryon to meson ratios had been observed previously and were referred to as \"baryon anomaly\"[55,56,57]. However, unlike at RHIC, the enhancement for central collisions of roughly a factor of three relative to the pp value persists out to at least 6 GeV/c. Qualitatively such an enhancement is expected from radial flow (the heavier baryons are pushed further out in p T than the lighter mesons), as shown by the full line, which represents the \u039b/K 0 S extracted from the hydro model VISH2+1 already shown inFig. 2a. Quantitatively, however, the measured shape is very different indicating a progressive decoupling of hadrons from pure hydrodynamic flow above 2 GeV/c (seeFig. 2a). Global observables like momentum spectra, particle ratios and anisotropic flow seem to be governed by collective and thermal processes below p T < 2 \u2212 3 GeV/c, whereas hard processes and fragmentation dominate above p T > 6 \u2212 10 GeV/c.
