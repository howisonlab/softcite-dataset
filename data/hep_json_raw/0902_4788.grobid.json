Phase transitions like this often show large fluctuations in various measurable quantities, like e.g. bubble sizes in boiling water. In high-energy interactions fluctuations can be studied in the variation in the number of produced particles of various species, or even better in ratios of such numbers. However, since the number of produced particles is limited, fluctuations are to a large extent of statistical nature and efforts have to be made in order to find out whether there are additional, dynamical fluctuations present or not. Pruneau, Gavin, and Voloshin [1] have shown that the fluctuation measure \u03bd dyn has robust properties, but it was not shown how one can learn about the underlying physics, i.e. how to interpret \u03bd dyn .",

We extend pair production to triplets and show that two-and three-particle correlations can be differentiated only if the \u03bd dyn -value exceeds the maximum value for two-particle correlations. Some very important sum rules are shown to relate fluctuations when charge states are considered. Finally we discuss how the experimental analysis can affect \u03bd dyn . In sections 2-4 we discuss some of the ideas already expressed in [1], but the sections 5-12 contain material never discussed before.",

We have shown that purely statistical fluctuations lead to \u03bd dyn = 0, and that \u03bd dyn directly measures the two-particle parameter, \u03b5. We have furthermore shown that higher-order correlations will be undistinguishable from twoparticle correlations unless they are large enough to pass the limit imposed by two-particle correlations. A generalization of \u03bd dyn is shown to be sensitive to the asymmetric part of threeparticle correlations. A relation between different fluctuations (sum rules) has been derived and an expression for the statistical error of \u03bd dyn is given. Detector effects as well as of acceptance limitations have been briefly discussed.",
