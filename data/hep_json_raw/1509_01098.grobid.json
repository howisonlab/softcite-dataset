            "text": "Determination of parameters of the standard model (SM) plays an important role in the search for new physics. In the SM, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1,2] gives a successful description of all current measurements of CP violation. The CP-violating parameters \u03c6 1 , \u03c6 2 , and \u03c6 3 are the three angles of the most equilateral of the CKM unitarity triangles, of which \u03c6 3 \u2261 arg \u2212V ud V ub * /V cd V cb * is the least accurately determined. In the usual quark-phase convention, where the complex phase is negligible in the CKM matrix elements other than V ub and V td [3], the measurement of \u03c6 3 is equivalent to the extraction of the phase of V ub . To date, \u03c6 3 measurements have been performed mainly with B meson decays into D ( * ) K ( * ) final states [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13], all of which exploit the interference between theD ( * )0 and D ( * )0 decaying into a common final state. In particular, Dalitz analyses of B \u00b1 \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * )\u00b1 , D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 + \u03c0 \u2212 provide the most precise determination of \u03c6 3 . The Dalitz analysis technique for the measurement of \u03c6 3 was proposed in Ref. [14]. Belle reported the first \u03c6 3 measurement with the model-independent Dalitz analysis technique in Ref. [15], which exploits a set of measured strong phases instead of relying on a D decay model into a three-body final state.",

Model independence is achieved by binning the Dalitz plot of the D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay and using the strong-phase coefficients with binning as in the CLEO experiment [22]. We obtain the value r S < 0.87 at 68% C.L. This measurement results in lower statistical precision than the model-dependent measurement from BaBar with the B 0 \u2192 DK 0 mode [9] despite the larger data sample due to the smaller B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 signal observed.
