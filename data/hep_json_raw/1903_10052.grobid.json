The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon micro-strip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnet systems that provide a field integral between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers covering the region |\u03b7| < 2.7 and fast detectors for triggering within the range |\u03b7| < 2.4.

This requirement further suppresses top-quark events with an additional non-prompt lepton from b-hadron decays. In order to select final states with neutrinos, E miss T is required to be above 30 GeV. The invariant masses m of all SFOS pairs are required to satisfy a Z -veto selection: |m \u2212 m Z | > 25 GeV. The last two requirements suppress W Z/W \u03b3 * and Z Z * events, and improve the Z +jets rejection. In order to suppress background events from heavy-flavour quarkonia, the smallest invariant mass of SFOS pairs is required to be greater than 12 GeV. The signal efficiency of this selection with respect to the preselection is 34.6%. A discriminant based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) [63,64] is used to achieve a further separation between signal and background processes. The main purpose of the multivariate classifier, named BDT Zdom , is to distinguish between signal and the dominant W Z/W \u03b3 * and Z Z * background processes, and hence it is trained against these two background processes. The BDT Zdom uses seven input variables. They are the magnitude of the vectorial sum of lepton transverse momenta (| p i T |), the invariant masses of the first lepton pair (m 0 1 ) and of the three leptons (m ), the angular distance R 0 1 , E miss T and the pseudorapidity separation between the leptons with the same charge ( \u03b7 1 2 ).

The theoretical uncertainties are evaluated by comparing nominal and alternative event generators and UEPS models as described in Section 3 and by varying PDF sets and the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales.

Additionally, one Poisson probability term is added for each CR to determine simultaneously the normalisation of the corresponding background processes. Systematic uncertainties enter as nuisance parameters in the likelihood function and their correlations are taken into account. The final results are obtained using the profile likelihood method [71]. The resulting post-fit prediction and data yields in the four SRs are shown in Table 5.     .4 \u22120.9 . The observed (expected) significances of W H and Z H production modes are 2.6 (1.3) standard deviations and 2.8 (1.2) standard deviations above the SM background, including other Higgs-boson processes, respectively. When determining the significance for W H production, the Z H signal-strength parameter is left floating in the fit, and vice versa.
