An analysis of a triple-differential decay rate in t-channel production is used to simultaneously determine five generalised helicity fractions and phases, as well as the polarisation of the produced top quark. The complex parameters are then constrained. This analysis is based on 20.2 fb \u22121 of protonproton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The fraction of decays containing transversely polarised W bosons is measured to be f 1 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.05. The phase between amplitudes for transversely and longitudinally polarised W bosons recoiling against left-handed b-quarks is measured to be \u03b4 \u2212 = 0.002\u03c0 +0.016\u03c0   +0.017\u03c0 , giving no indication of CP violation. The fractions of longitudinal or transverse W bosons accompanied by right-handed b-quarks are also constrained. Based on these measurements, limits are placed at 95% CL on the ratio of the complex coupling parameters Re",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle, making the measurement of its production and decay kinematic properties an important probe of physical processes beyond the Standard Model (SM). Within the SM, the top quark decays predominantly through the electroweak interaction to an on-shell W boson and a b-quark. Due to its large mass [1], its lifetime O(10 \u221225 s) is smaller than its hadronisation time-scale O(10 \u221224 s), allowing this quark to be studied as a free quark. Since the top-quark lifetime is also shorter than the depolarisation timescale O(10 \u221221 s) [2] and the W boson is produced onshell in the top-quark decay, the top-quark spin information is directly transferred to its decay products. Comparing angular measurements of the decay products of polarised top quarks with precise SM predictions provides a unique way to study the non-SM couplings in the Wtb vertex [3]. The normalised triple-differential cross-section (to be defined in section 2) is the joint probability distribution in all three of the angles determining the JHEP12(2017)017 kinematics of the decay t \u2192 W b from a polarised initial state. Its analysis is the most complete investigation of the dynamics of top-quark decay undertaken to date.",

            "text": "At hadron colliders, top quarks are produced predominantly in pairs (tt) via the flavourconserving strong interaction, while an alternative process produces single top quarks through the electroweak interaction. Although the tt production cross-section is larger than that of single-top-quark production, top quarks are produced unpolarised because of parity conservation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [4], contrary to what happens for single top quarks. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [5], in proton-proton (pp) collision data, the t-channel is the dominant process for producing single top quarks used for the measurements presented in this paper. Figure 1 shows the two representative leading-order (LO) Feynman diagrams for t-channel single-top-quark production. In these two diagrams, a light-flavour quark q (i.e. u-ord-quark) from one of the colliding protons interacts with a b-quark by exchanging a virtual W boson, producing a top quark t and a recoiling lightflavour quark q , called the spectator quark. The b-quark comes either directly from another colliding proton in the five-flavour scheme (5FS) or 2 \u2192 2 process (a) or from a gluon splitting in the four-flavour scheme 1 (4FS) or 2 \u2192 3 process (b). In pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, the predicted t-channel production cross-section using the 5FS is 87.8 +3.4 \u22121.9 pb [6], calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD with resummed next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, and called approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the following. The calculation assumes a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV and uses the MSTW2008 NNLO [7,8] parton distribution function (PDF) set. The uncertainties correspond to the sum in quadrature of the uncertainty obtained from the MSTW2008 NNLO PDF set at the 90% confidence level (CL) and the factorisation and renormalisation scale uncertainties.",

Here, g is the weak coupling constant, and m W and q \u03bd are the mass and the four-momentum of the W boson. The terms P L,R \u2261 1 \u2213 \u03b3 5 /2 are the left-and right-handed projection operators and \u03c3 \u00b5\u03bd = i[\u03b3 \u00b5 , \u03b3 \u03bd ]/2. The terms V L,R and g L,R are the left-and right-handed vector and tensor complex couplings, respectively. In the SM at LO, all coupling constants vanish, except V L = V tb , which is a quark-mixing element in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Deviations from these values would provide hints of physics beyond the SM, and furthermore, complex values could imply that the top-quark decay has a CP-violating component [15][16][17][18][19]. Indirect constraints on V L , V R , g L , and g R were obtained [20,21] from precision measurements of B-meson decays. These results yield constraints in a six-dimensional space of operator coefficients, where four of them correspond to Wtb couplings. Considering one coefficient at a time results in very tight constraints on a particular combination of V R and g L , but if several coefficients are allowed to move simultaneously, then individual bounds are not possible. Very tight constraints on CP-violating interactions have been derived from measurements of electric dipole moments [22]. Those constraints also depend on combinations of couplings, and in a global fit [23], cannot constrain Im [g R ] better than direct measurements, as are presented here. Measurements of the W boson helicity fractions in top-quark decays [24][25][26][27][28] are sensitive to the magnitude of combinations of anomalous couplings, which are assumed to be purely real, corresponding to the CP-conserving case.",

The procedures for modelling background processes are reported in section 7. The event yields and angular distributions comparing the predictions and the observed data are shown in section 8. Section 9 describes the efficiency, resolution, and background models used to translate the distribution of true t-channel signal events to the distribution of reconstructed signal and background events, and how the parameters of the model are estimated.

            "text": "An event-specific coordinate system is defined for analysing the decay of the top quark in its rest frame, using the directions of the spectator quark q that recoils against the top quark, the W boson from the top-quark decay, and the lepton (e, \u00b5 or \u03c4 ) from the W boson decay, in the final state depicted in figure 2. The\u1e91-axis is chosen along the direction of the W boson momentum, q, or equivalently along the direction opposite to the b-quark momentum, boosted into the top-quark rest frame,\u1e91 \u2261q = q/| q|. The reconstruction of the W boson and top quark is discussed in section 6. As mentioned before, the spin of single top quarks, s t , in t-channel production is predominantly aligned along the direction of the spectator-quark momentum, p s , in the top-quark rest frame,p s = p s /| p s | [9]. If this quark defines the spin-analysing direction, the degree of polarisation is shown in refs. [3,38,39] to be P \u2261p s \u2022 s t /| s t | \u2248 0.9 at \u221a s = 8 TeV for SM couplings. A three-dimensional righthanded coordinate system is defined from theq-p s plane and the perpendicular direction, with\u0177 =p s \u00d7q andx =\u0177 \u00d7q. In this coordinate system, the direction of the lepton momentum, p * , in the W boson rest frame,p * = p * /| p * |, is specified by the polar angle \u03b8 * and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 * . The third angle \u03b8 is defined as the angle betweenp s andq. The angle \u03b8 * is the same angle used to measure the W boson helicity fractions in top-quark decays [24][25][26][27][28]. These three angles, \u03b8, \u03b8 * , and \u03c6 * , arise as a natural choice for measuring a tripledifferential distribution for the decay of the top quark, where the W boson subsequently JHEP12(2017)017 decays leptonically. The t \u2192 W b transition is determined by four helicity amplitudes, A \u03bb W ,\u03bb b , where \u03bb W and \u03bb b are the helicities of the W boson and the b-quark, respectively [36]. For \u03bb b = 1 2 , only the W boson helicities \u03bb W = 1, 0 are possible, while for \u03bb b = \u2212 1 2 , \u03bb W = \u22121, 0 are possible. The angular dependence of these transition amplitudes is given in ref. [36]. At LO and neglecting the b-quark mass, the helicity amplitudes have a simple dependence on the anomalous couplings. Up to a common proportionality constant, the magnitudes can be expressed as",

The central EM calorimeter is a lead and liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter with high granularity, and is divided into a barrel region that covers |\u03b7| < 1.5 and endcap regions that cover 1.4 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator tile calorimeter provides hadronic energy measurements in the central range of |\u03b7| < 1.7. The endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward regions (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements. The MS consists of three large superconducting toroid magnets with eight coils each, a system of trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4, and precision tracking chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.7.

The clusters are calibrated with a local cluster weighting method [73]. The jet energy is further corrected for the effect of multiple pp interactions. Jets are calibrated using an energy-and \u03b7-dependent simulation-based scheme, with in situ corrections based on data [74]. To reject jets from pile-up events, a so-called jet-vertex-fraction (JVF) criterion [75] is applied to the jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4: at least 50% of the scalar sum of the p T of the tracks associated with a jet is required to be from tracks compatible with the primary vertex. 5 Only events containing reconstructed jets with p T > 30 GeV and JHEP12(2017)017 |\u03b7| < 4.5 are considered. The p T threshold is raised to 35 GeV for the jets in the calorimeter endcap-forward transition region, corresponding to 2.7 < |\u03b7| < 3.5 [29]. Jets identified as likely to contain b-hadrons are tagged as b-jets. The b-tagging is performed using a neural network (NN) which combines three different algorithms exploiting the properties of a b-hadron decay in a jet [76]. The b-tagging algorithm, only applied to jets within the coverage of the ID (i.e. |\u03b7| < 2.5), is optimised to improve the rejection of c-quark jets, since W boson production in association with c-quarks is a major background for the selected final state. The requirement applied to the NN discriminant corresponds to a b-tagging efficiency of 50%, with mis-tagging rates of 3.9% and 0.07% for c-quark jets and light-flavour jets (u-, d-, s-quark or gluon g), respectively, as predicted in simulated tt events and calibrated with data [77,78].",

Since the neutrino escapes undetected, the x and y components of the reconstructed E miss T are assumed to correspond to the p T of the neutrino. The unmeasured longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum, p z \u03bd , is computed by imposing a W boson mass constraint on the lepton-neutrino system. A quadratic expression is found for p z \u03bd . If there are two real solutions, the solution closer to zero is taken. If the solutions are complex, the assumption of the neutrino being the only contributor to the E miss T is not valid. 7 Therefore, the reconstructed E miss T is rescaled, preserving its direction, in order to have physical (real) solutions for p z \u03bd . This generally results in two solutions for the rescaled E miss T . If just one solution of the rescaled E miss T is positive, this is chosen. If both are positive, the one closer to the initial E miss T is chosen. The top-quark candidate is then reconstructed by combining the four-momenta of the reconstructed W boson and the selected b-tagged jet. Finally, the momenta of the W boson and spectator jet are boosted into the top-quark rest frame to obtain q and p s , used to define the coordinate system in figure 2, and the lepton is boosted into the W boson rest frame to obtain p * .",

In these three fitted regions the production of a W boson in association with heavy-flavour jets is the dominant contribution to the W +jets background, predicted to be around 95% in each region. The Z+jets and diboson contributions, which are very low in the signal region (2% of the expected total), are merged and fixed to the predictions. The multijet contribution is kept fixed to its data-driven estimate. The overall normalisation scale factors obtained from the maximum-likelihood fit together with the statistical post-fit uncertainties are found to be 1.010 \u00b1 0.005 and 1.128 \u00b1 0.013 for the top-quark and W +jets background contributions, respectively, and 0.909 \u00b1 0.022 for the t-channel signal. The impact on the analysis due to the deviation of these scale factors from unity is negligible and it is taken into account through the W +jets normalisation uncertainty as discussed in section 10. In the case of the W +jets validation region, used to validate the shapes of the predicted templates, just an overall scale factor for the W +jets component is estimated. It is extracted by matching the total predicted event yields to the number of events observed in this validation region. The results are found to be stable when the prior constraints on the top-quark and W +jets backgrounds are relaxed to 100% of their predicted cross-section in the signal and control regions.",

For the background model, constructed from the sum of all predicted backgrounds with an appreciable effect on the distribution, this includes events containing top quarks, primarily from tt production, the distribution of which is affected by changing the values of the anomalous couplings. The efficiency and resolution models are averages over all unmeasured distributions in the signal. Variations in the values of anomalous couplings alter those unmeasured distributions, which could lead to a dependence on these couplings for the efficiency and resolution models. For instance, t-channel single-top-quark production depends on anomalous couplings in both the top-quark production and decay vertices, so varying the couplings alters production-side distributions, such as the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the top or spectator quark. Therefore G and A b both depend upon \u03b1. When evaluating a for different possible values of \u03b1, the appropriate values of G( \u03b1) and A b ( \u03b1) must be used.

Systematic uncertainties associated with the signal and background modelling are estimated by comparing different generators and by varying parameters in the event generation. The uncertainty in the predicted efficiency and resolution models for the t-channel single-top-quark process, used to deconvolve reconstructed quantities (from Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia), is estimated by comparing the nominal Protos with AcerMC, both interfaced to Pythia. This uncertainty also accounts for the difference between models which consider the 4FS in Protos and the 5FS+4FS in AcerMC. The uncertainty in the ME calculation in the simulation of the t-channel process is estimated in two ways; by comparing Protos with Powheg-Box, both interfaced to Pythia, to account for the mis-modelling of an NLO process by a LO generator, and by comparing Powheg-Box with MG5 aMC@NLO (ver. 2.2.2) [101], both interfaced to Herwig (ver. 6.5.20.2) [102] using ATLAS underlying event tune 2 (AUET2) [103], to account for modelling differences between NLO generators. For the tt process, Powheg-Box is compared with MC@NLO (version 4.06) [104], both also interfaced to Herwig using the AUET2 tune. The uncertainty in the PS and hadronisation is estimated by comparing Powheg-Box interfaced with Pythia and Herwig for both the t-channel and tt processes. The uncertainty in the amount of radiation is evaluated for the t-channel and tt processes by comparing the nominal samples with the Powheg-Box samples generated with varied factorisation and renormalisation scales (and different values of the h damp parameter in the case of the tt samples), interfaced to Pythia with different hadronisation scales or configurations via alternative Perugia sets of tuned parameters (P2012radHi, P2012radLo, P2012mpiHi and P2012loCR) [60]. In this case, the uncertainty is defined by the shift from the nominal measurement. All these signal and background modelling uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between t-channel and tt.",

Likelihood profiles and joint likelihood contours for these couplings are shown in figures 12 and 13. The 68% contours represent the total uncertainty in the measurement. The normalised observables measured in this paper are sensitive to ratios of couplings, which are presented normalised to the dominant coupling in the SM, V L . The quantities f + 1 and f + 0 depend most strongly on two different combinations of V R and g L , while the quantities f 1 (1 \u2212 f + 1 ) and \u03b4 \u2212 depend more strongly on V L and g R . Since the likelihood is determined in terms of all of these quantities simultaneously, no assumptions need to be imposed on couplings in order to produce these distributions. In each case the measured values are consistent with the SM prediction, i.e. V R = g L,R = 0.  The bounds obtained on V R and g L are shown in figure 12.

An analysis of angular distributions of the decay products of single top quarks produced in the tchannel constrains these parameters simultaneously. The analysis is based on 20.2 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The selected events contain one isolated electron or muon, large E miss T , and exactly two jets, with one of them identified as likely to contain a b-hadron. A cut-based analysis is used to discriminate the signal events from background, and the electron and muon channels are merged. An OSDE technique is used to perform an angular analysis of the triple-differential decay rate in order to determine six observables simultaneously, i.e. five generalised helicity fractions and phases, as well as the polarisation of the produced top quark. Detector effects are deconvolved from data using Fourier techniques. The fraction f 1 of decays containing transversely polarised W bosons is measured to be f 1 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.05. The phase \u03b4 \u2212 between amplitudes for transversely and longitudinally polarised W bosons recoiling against left-handed b-quarks, is measured to be \u03b4 \u2212 = 0.002\u03c0 +0.016\u03c0 \u22120.017\u03c0 , giving no indication of CP violation. The fractions of transverse and longitudinal W bosons accompanied by right-handed b-quarks are also constrained at 95% CL to f + 1 < 0.120 and f + 0 < 0.085, respectively. The fractions f 1 and f + 1 are related to the W boson helicity fractions (F R , F 0 , and F L ), while the fraction f + 0 , which is previously unmeasured, separates F 0 into two components involving left-and right-handed b-quarks. Based on these measurements, 95% CL intervals are placed on the ratio of the complex coupling parameters g R and V L such that Re The crucial computing support from all WLCG partners is acknowledged gratefully, in particular from CERN, the ATLAS Tier-1 facilities at TRIUMF (Canada), NDGF (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), CC-IN2P3 (France), KIT/GridKA (Germany), INFN-CNAF (Italy), NL-T1 (Netherlands), PIC (Spain), ASGC (Taiwan), RAL (UK) and BNL (USA), the Tier-2 facilities worldwide and large non-WLCG resource providers.

The measurements presented here require no assumptions in values of the other anomalous couplings, and on their own can exclude large values of Re [g R /V L ]. Along these lines, from the double-differential angular decay rates in t-channel singletop-quark events in ATLAS at \u221a s = 7 TeV [33], confidence intervals are placed simultaneously on the coupling ratios, Re [g R /V L ] \u2208 [\u22120.36, 0.10] and Im [g R /V L ] \u2208 [\u22120.17, 0.23], at 95% CL, assuming V R = g L = 0. Furthermore, slightly better limits on the imaginary part of g R are set from asymmetries by ATLAS at \u221a s = 8 TeV, giving Im [g R ] \u2208 [\u22120.18, 0.06] [34], at 95% CL, assuming again V R = g L = 0. The limits presented in this paper improve on both these results and extend current constraints on g R to the whole complex plane by simultaneously measuring information about Re [g R /V L ] and Im [g R /V L ].",
