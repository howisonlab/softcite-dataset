            "text": "Almost 40 years after its discovery, heavy quarkonium still represents a challenging testing ground for models [1] based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Results obtained for charmonium production at the Tevatron collider in the 1990s [2] led theory to recognize the role of intermediate quark-antiquark color-octet states in the production process, in the framework of the nonrelativistic QCD model [3]. This approach brought the calculations of p t spectra to agree rather well with the data [4] (p t is the transverse momentum, i.e., the momentum component perpendicular to the colliding beam direction). However, the same calculations were not able to reproduce satisfactorily the polarization results for the J=c obtained by the CDF experiment at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV [5]. In particular, the nonrelativistic QCD model at leading order predicts for high-p t J=c (p t ) m J=c ) a significant transverse polarization, i.e., a dominant angular momentum component J z \u00bc AE1, the z axis being defined by the J=c 's own momentum direction in the center of mass frame of the pp (p p) collision. Contrary to this expectation, the CDF data [5] rather exhibit a mild longitudinal polarization (J z \u00bc 0). In a recent renaissance of quarkonium studies, also related to the publication of results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:2 TeV [6], next-to-leading-order corrections for both color-singlet and color-octet intermediate states were calculated, and their impact on the p t spectra was found to be quite important [7][8][9]. The influence of these corrections on the polarization calculations is expected to be significant [10,11] and still has not been completely worked out. The start-up of the LHC provides the possibility to perform charmonium measurements in a new energy domain, over large ranges in p t and rapidity \u00f0y \u00bc 0:5 ln\u00bd\u00f0E \u00fe p z \u00de=\u00f0E \u00c0 p z \u00de, where E is the energy and p z is the momentum component parallel to the colliding beam direction\u00de. Various theoretical approaches [8,12,13] proved to be rather successful in describing the first LHC experimental results on the J=c p t spectra [14][15][16][17]. The measurement of polarization clearly represents a more stringent test of the theoretical calculations, offering therefore the possibility of confirming or ruling out the current QCD approach to charmonium production. In this Letter, we present the results of a study of J=c polarization at the LHC, carried out by the ALICE experiment in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV. The ALICE experiment [18] is based on a central barrel, covering the pseudorapidity region jj < 0: 9 [19], and a muon spectrometer, with 2:5 < < 4 coverage. The polarization results presented in this Letter refer to inclusive J=c , measured via the J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay in the muon spectrometer. The spectrometer [17] consists of a 10 interaction length ( I ) thick front absorber, to remove hadrons, followed by a 3 T m dipole magnet. Charged particles which exit the front absorber are tracked in a detector system made up of five stations, each one with two planes of cathode pad chambers. The tracking system is followed by a 7:2 I iron wall, which absorbs secondary hadrons escaping the front absorber and low-momentum muons. Finally, a trigger system, based on resistive plate chambers, is used to select candidate muons with a transverse momentum larger than a given programmable threshold. The analysis presented in this Letter was carried out on a significant fraction of the 2010 sample of muon-triggered events, corresponding to an integrated luminosity L int $ 100 nb \u00c01 . The usual event selection cuts, already applied to a previous analysis of J=c production [17], were also used for the polarization study. Events with at least one vertex reconstructed in the inner tracking system [20] are retained for the following analysis if they contain at least two tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer, out of which at least one has to satisfy the trigger condition (1 GeV=c p t threshold). We note that with this requirement the acceptance of the spectrometer for J=c extends down to p t \u00bc 0. The tracks must satisfy the condition 2:5 < < 4 and must also have 17:6 < R abs < 88:9 cm, *Full author list given at the end of the article. where R abs is the radial distance of the track from the beam axis at the exit of the front absorber (z \u00bc 503 cm). The latter requirement eliminates forward tracks, which, due to the high-Z material used in the absorber in that region, are strongly affected by multiple scattering. Finally, a rapidity cut 2:5 < y < 4 is applied to the selected muon pairs.",

For both tracking and triggering detectors, the time variation of the efficiencies during the data-taking period was accounted for (see [17] for details). Since the cos and acceptances are strongly correlated, the acceptance values as a function of one variable strongly depend on the input distribution used for the other variable. Given the fact that the correct input distributions are not known a priori but rather represent the outcome of the data analysis, an iterative procedure was followed in order to determine them. In the first iteration, a flat distribution of the angular variables (equivalent to a totally unpolarized J=c distribution) was adopted to calculate the acceptances. After correcting the signal with those acceptances, a first determination of the polarization parameters is performed, and the results are then used in a second determination of the acceptance values. The procedure is then repeated until convergence is reached; i.e., the extracted polarization parameters do not vary by more than 0.005 between two successive iterations. This occurs, for this analysis, after at most three steps. It was also checked that by using polarized MC input distributions in the first iteration the procedure converges towards the same results as in the default, unpolarized, case. Typical A i \" i values vary between $0:22 (0.05) at low p t and large j cosj and $0:41 (0.63) at large p t and small j cosj for the HE (CS) frame.",

In the one-dimensional approach followed in this analysis, could be estimated from the data, defining an ad hoc variable, which is a function of cos and and contains as a parameter (see [21] for details). In principle, the iterative procedure applied to and determination could be extended to include ; however, in some cases, relatively small statistical fluctuations in the distributions of the measured variables tend to induce large variations of the fitted values in the following iterations, leading to convergence problems. A check of the \u00bc 0 assumption was done a posteriori for each p t bin, by fitting the distributions, corrected with an acceptance which makes use of the measured and values as inputs. In this way, we get for all the p t bins values compatible with zero for both CS and HE reference frames. We also note that all the previous experiments assumed \u00bc 0 in their analysis, with the exception of HERA-B [23], who measured it in pA collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 41:6 GeV and found values ranging from 0 to 0.05. Various sources of systematic uncertainty on the measurement of the polarization parameters have been investigated. The uncertainty on the signal extraction was studied by leaving in the fits the width of the CB function as a free parameter. This choice leads to an absolute variation of the polarization parameters between 0.02 and 0.10. Another sizable source of systematic uncertainty is the choice of the input distributions for p t and y in the simulation. It was evaluated by comparing the results obtained with a parameterization of our 7 TeV results on differential J=c cross sections [17] with those obtained by using an extrapolation of lower energy results [24]. The absolute effect on the polarization parameters varies between 0.01 and 0.07. For the lowest p t bin, the acceptance in the HE frame drops by about 40% in the highest j cosj bin used in the analysis (0:6 < j cosj < 0:8) and has also a strong variation inside the bin itself. We therefore followed an alternative approach, fitting the angular spectrum in the restricted interval 0 < j cosj < 0:6 (instead of the default choice 0 < j cosj < 0:8), and we conservatively considered the variation in the result of the fit (0.15) as an additional systematic uncertainty on . For consistency, the same evaluation was performed in the CS frame. The role of the systematic uncertainties on the trigger and tracking efficiency [17] was also studied. The first was evaluated by varying the efficiency values for each detector element by 2% with respect to the default values in the simulation. This choice is related to the estimated uncertainty on the detector efficiency calculation. For the second, we have used the rather conservative choice of comparing the reference results, obtained with realistic dead channel maps, with those relative to an ideal detector setup. The result is typically 0.03-0.04. Finally, by quadratically combining the results for the various sources, values between 0.04 and 0.21 are obtained for the global systematic uncertainties.",

The polarization of the nonprompt component is expected to be quite small. In fact, even if a sizable polarization were observed when the polarization axis refers to the B-meson direction [25], it would be strongly smeared when it is calculated with respect to the direction of the decay J=c [15], as observed by CDF, who measured in this way \u00f0J=c B\u00de $ \u00c00:1 in the HE frame [5]. By assuming conservatively j \u00f0J=c B\u00dej < 0:2 for both frames, and taking into account the fraction of the inclusive yield coming from B-meson decays [15], the difference between prompt and inclusive J=c polarization was estimated and found to be at most 0.05, a value smaller than the systematic uncertainties of our measurements. Concerning higher-mass charmonia, the c ! J=c \u00fe decay cannot be reconstructed in the muon spectrometer, and the c \u00f02S\u00de ! statistics is currently too low. Values of the feed-down ratios measured mainly by lower energy experiments range from $10% for the c \u00f02S\u00de [26] to 25%-30% for the c [27], implying that there could be a sizable difference between direct and prompt J=c polarization.",
