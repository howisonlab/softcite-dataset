We report results from the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS II) experiment that give the first direct-detection limits for cosmogenicallyproduced relativistic particles with electric charge lower than e/6. A search for tracks in the six stacked detectors of each of two of the CDMS II towers found no candidates, thereby excluding new parameter space for particles with electric charges between e/6 and e/200.",

            "text": "Fractionally-charged particles are a well-known feature of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics; quarks and anti-quarks possess either \u00b12/3 or \u00b11/3 of the electron charge, e. Because of the nature of the strong interaction, however, these particles are bound inside hadrons. Free particles with smaller charges are viable in extensions of the SM with extra U (1) gauge symmetries, a common situation in string theories [1][2][3]. Some of these models feature a dark photon with a small kinetic mixing with the SM photon [4] that can confer an effective (very small) charge to particles in a hidden sector. Scenarios with milli-charged dark matter particles can be constructed in this way. The question remains whether such fundamental particles with tiny electric charge exist. Levitometer, Millikan-droplet, collider-based experiments [5], and astrophysical (\"direct search\") experiments [6][7][8][9] have searched for free particles with fractional charges. Direct searches are particularly interesting because energetic cosmic rays may produce fractionally charged particles with masses inaccessible to collider experiments. Particles with fractional charge f e would lose energy at a rate proportional to f 2 , much more slowly than known minimum ionizing particles under similar conditions [10]. Direct-search experiments look for the smaller interaction energies characteristic of such Lightly Ionizing Particles (LIPs) [7].",

This geometry dramatically enhances LIP background rejection when requiring all detectors along the path of a possible track to have similarly low-energy signals and hit locations that lie approximately along a straight line. Figure 1 illustrates this rejection method by contrasting a hypothetical LIP candidate with a typical 6-detector background event from multiple Compton scattering of a photon. The CDMS tower geometry, coupled with the very low-energy detection thresholds (\u223c1 keV), provides sensitivity to LIPs with substantially smaller fractional charges than searched for in prior direct-detection experiments [6][7][8][9].",

The detector array consisted of 19 Ge and 11 Si ZIPs, each a disk \u223c10 mm thick and 76 mm in diameter. Each detector was instrumented with four phonon sensors on one face and two concentric ionization electrodes on the opposite face. A small electric field (3-4 V/cm) was applied across the detectors to extract charge carriers created by particle interactions. The detectors were surrounded by passive lead and polyethylene shielding and cooled to 50 mK. An outer plastic-scintillator veto identified muons with sufficient energy to penetrate the 2090 meters water-equivalent overburden of the Soudan Underground Laboratory. The CDMS II experiment was designed primarily to identify nuclear recoils from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by measuring both the ionization and phonons created by particle interactions within a detector [11]. The data described here were recorded from July 2007 to September 2008 [11]. Only towers of fully working detectors, Tower 2 and Tower 4, were used to search for LIP tracks, resulting in raw exposures after removal of bad data periods of 59.6 and 142.4 days, respectively.",

The w i are chosen so that the minimum E c occurs when the F i are distributed as uniformly as possible, w i = 1/6 except for w 0 and w 6 , which are 1/12. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cram\u00e9r-von Mises statistics are minimized by the same distribution of energies, but this definition of E c gives a penalty that grows especially large when a detector's energy is far out on the tail of the expected distribution, as is likely for the dominant photon background. We accept events with E c < 2.37, a value chosen to have \u224899% efficiency for simulated LIPs of any f (see Fig. 5 for the example of f = 1/15). Another consequence of minimally deflected LIPs is that the locations of each detector's interaction are expected to follow a linear track with deviations primarily due to uncertainty in position reconstruction, while background photons typically deflect from a straight track as they multiply scatter through a tower. A full 3dimensional \u03c7 2 fit was performed to each 6-detector track under a straight-line hypothesis. Events were rejected when \u03c7 2 /DOF > 2, approximately maximizing the expected signal-to-background ratio for all values of f considered. In order to compute \u03c7 2 , the 3-dimensional position resolution of the measurement in each detector had to be determined. In track fitting, the xy (horizontal) coordinates are reconstructed using phonon pulse information. A position-independent xy resolution was initially computed using phonon pulse amplitudes and varied from 5 mm for low energy depositions to 2 mm for high energy depositions.",

The z-position uncertainty is a function of the assumed fractional charge and is estimated by the standard deviation of a large number of simulated events. The simulation uses the following procedure. Whenever the sum of the energy depositions falls within the analyzed region, the simulation takes a Poisson distribution of the number of interactions, assigns each a random position and energy deposition from the single-interaction probability distribution, and computes the deviation of the energy-weighted position from where the track intersects the horizontal midplane of the detector.",

Later it was realized that the xy-position reconstruction was significantly less accurate than originally estimated, and the resolution was worse than assumed. So after unblinding, we defined a new nonblind track-linearity selection criterion, but without using any of the information revealed from the unblinding. The revised xy position was estimated using not only phonon signal amplitudes, but also information from phonon relative start times and phonon pulse shapes. We then corrected for position-dependent xy biases in each detector with an algorithm [16] based on the assumption that background gamma rays uniformly illuminate the detectors. After this correction, surface-to-surface events shared between adjacent detectors were used to obtain estimates of detector xy-position resolution. Such events typically have 2 mm true lateral separation, with measured separation smeared by detector resolution. Thus, detector resolution as a function of energy was obtained by deconvolving the observed resolution from lateral separation using conservative assumptions when necessary. This corrected, position-dependent xy resolution varies from \u223c8-20 mm with the worst at low energy. \"Conservative\" means these estimates are expected to be larger than is realistic. Larger estimates decrease a track's computed value of \u03c7 2 and increase LIP acceptance. In the absence of a signal, this leads to a conservative upper limit. The improved position measurements and resolution estimates were used in the new nonblind track- linearity selection, setting the criterion to maximize expected signal-to-background as a function of f . Monte Carlo simulations were then used to compute the LIP acceptance fraction of both the blind and nonblind tracklinearity criteria. Both blind and nonblind results are correct. The much less sensitive blind result is also reported in order to show the effect of the original, poorly chosen, track-linearity selection criterion, with its acceptance \u223c 10 \u22123 , to be compared with between 0.86 and 0.94 for the nonblind cut.",
