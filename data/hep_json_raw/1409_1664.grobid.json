Ref. [11] using a longitudinal distribution of the interaction region \u03c3 Z = 2.3 cm and RF cavity voltage V cav = 18 kV. Full energy spread (FWHM = 0.590 MeV) is significantly larger than the width of \u03b7 \u2032 , as demonstrated in Fig. 2. A solid line in Fig. 2 shows a differential luminosity distribution dL/dE versus the c.m. collision energy, with an area normalized to the total integrated luminosity L = 2.69 pb \u22121 . This distribution should be convolved with a Breit-Wigner (BW) function, describing the \u03b7 \u2032 line shape (the dotted line in Fig. 2). Radiation of photons by initial particles changes a collision energy and the BW should be additionally convolved with a radiator function described in Ref. [12,13]. These radiative corrections decrease the number of signal events by approximately 40%. The area under the dashed line in Fig. 2 illustrates the \"effective\" integrated luminosity for \u03b7 \u2032 production in our experiment in comparison with the total integrated luminosity under the solid line.",

For the studied decay mode with B \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 = 0.429 [2], the calculated cross section for the unitarity limit of \u0393 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192e + e \u2212 is very small, \u03c3 int \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 nb, and should be compared with the cross section of the singlephoton reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7. The events of this process were observed only above E c.m. > 1200 MeV and the energy dependence of the cross section was well described in the model where the final state is produced via three interfering resonances -\u03c1(770), \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700), see for example Ref. [19].

This value is comparable or larger than the two-photon cross section \u03c3 int with possible enhancement due to the form factor, and to prove signal observation a measurement outside \u03b7 \u2032 (958) mass is needed. Note that the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 decay mode is free from the single-photon physical background, and we plan to use it for such a study as well.",

Reconstructed momenta and angles of the detected charged tracks and energy and angles of two photons are subject to the kinematic fit, assuming that the total energy is equal to E c.m. and total momentum is equal to zero. The covariance matrices for charged tracks and photons are used in the fit and provide a \u03c7 2 value for each event. If an event candidate has more than two photons, the photon pair with the smallest \u03c7 2 value is retained. As a result of the fit, we obtain improved values of the momenta, energies and angles for all particles. The main contribution to the selected sample comes from the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3.

A vertical arrow shows the applied selection. Figure 3(b) presents the \u03c7 2 distributions for the event candidates, in which the invariant mass of the photon pair is in the \u00b135 MeV/c 2 window around the \u03b7 mass for data (points), and the simulated distribution for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 (histogram). The \u03c7 2 distributions for data and simulation for the \u03c0 0 signal in Fig. 3(a) are in good agreement, and tighter selection shown by the vertical arrow in Fig. 3(b) changes the number of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 signal events by 1% only. After this selection some candidate events for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 are observed. Figure 4(a) shows a scatter plot of the total energy deposition in the calorimeter, E total , versus two-photon invariant mass for selected experimental \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 events. A clear signal of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events is seen.

The experimental sample contains a relatively large number of background events from various quantum electrodynamics processes, when scattered electron and positron are accompanied with a number of radiative photons. These processes leave significant amount of energy in the calorimeter and can be effectively suppressed by requiring E total < 0.7 \u2022 E c.m.
