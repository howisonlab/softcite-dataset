            "text": "Rare decays of b-hadrons are Flavor-Changing Neutral-Currents (FCNC), which are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM) and are thus very suppressed. As such, they are very sensitive to potential new particles entering the loops virtually and affecting properties of the decays such as branching fractions and angular distributions. Consequently, the measurement of these processes allows to probe higher scales than direct searches. As an example, the Feynman diagram of the FCNC b \u2192 s\u03b3 transition in the SM is shown in Fig. 1. From the theoretical viewpoint, these decays can be described in a model-independent way by means of the Operator Product Expansion. The effective Hamiltonian of the theory is expressed as a sum over all the possible operators, which are modulated by a set of coefficients, known as Wilson coefficients (C i ). The most relevant effective couplings are those parametrising the vector (C 9 ), vector-axial (C 10 ) and photon mediated (C 7 ) operators. The Wilson coefficients can be computed in the SM and compared to the values extracted from global fits to experimental data. Any significant deviation from the SM calculations taking into account both experimental and theory uncertainties would point to New Physics (NP) effects.",

            "text": "Lepton Universality Tests Lepton universality tests in b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions involve the comparison of muon and electron final states that share the same hadronic content, which in the SM are predicted to behave exactly equal, except for the lepton masses. Experimentally, electrons and muons are detected very differently, specially in a high momentum and occupancy environment such as the LHC, causing reconstruction and selection differences than need to be carefully controlled. At LHCb, the main differences arise from the way these events are triggered and from the Bremsstrahlung losses that electrons suffer as they traverse the detector material. At the hardware trigger level, electrons are selected as high energetic clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), while muons are distinguished by the traces they leave in the muon stations. Due to the different occupancies of both detectors, a larger transverse momentum threshold is needed in the ECAL to control the rate of selected events. This is mitigated by exploiting other parts of the event to trigger on. In particular, the hadron from the b \u2192 s + \u2212 decay of interest or any high energetic signature from the other b produced in the event are used. A procedure is in place to correct the electron track momentum from potential Bremsstrahlung losses. The direction of the track before the magnet is propagated to the ECAL surface and the momenta of photon clusters near the extrapolated track position are added to the one measured by the tracking. This provides a good recovery of a large fraction of the emitted energy but some signal photons can be missed while others originating from different processes can be incorrectly added, causing a degradation of the mass resolution for electron modes in comparison to muon ones. The ratio of branching fractions of a given b \u2192 s + \u2212 process with electrons or muons in the final state is predicted in the SM to be R H = B(H b \u2192 H s \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) B(H b \u2192 H s e + e \u2212 )",

Moreover, at LHCb, the R H ratios are measured as a double ratio between the rare and J/\u03c8 resonant modes, to ensure any potential systematics in the computation of efficiencies cancel out.An update of the measurement of the ratio R K = B(B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )/B(B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 ) has been published by LHCb early this year[25]. The analysis uses the dataset collected during 2011-2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 , and measures R K in the region 1.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 . A re-optimisation of the analysis of the 2011-2012 dataset[5] is performed together with the inclusion of new data not previously studied. In total, a factor 2 larger statistics than in the previous analysis is obtained. The r J/\u03c8 cross-check is found to be in good agreement with unity, r J/\u03c8 = 1.014 \u00b1 0.035. Moreover, this ratio is also measured in one and two-dimensional bins of decay kinematics and no significant trends are observed, validating the efficiency extraction from simulation and calibration samples. The invariant mass fits to K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and K + e + e \u2212 candidates are shown inFig. 5. The broader signal shape for the electron mode requires the usage of a larger fit range and the inclusion of more backgrounds in the fit model. In particular, partially reconstructed events of the type B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 with K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , where the \u03c0 \u2212 is not reconstructed, and contamination from the J/\u03c8 mode due to large Bremsstrahlung losses are significant in this case. In total, around 1940 and 760 B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 events are observed. Taking into account the reconstruction and selection efficiencies, the ratio of branching fractions between the two modes is measured to be R K = 0.846 +0.060+0.016 \u22120.054\u22120.014 ,(3.5)    where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This value is compatible with the previous LHCb result and deviates from the SM prediction of lepton universality at the level of 2.5\u03c3 .",
