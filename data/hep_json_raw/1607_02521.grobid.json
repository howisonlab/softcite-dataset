Thanks to the asymptotic freedom of QCD [1,2] many high-energy scattering processes can be analyzed using perturbation theory. In most cases such analyses are in the form of factorization theorems, which separate the perturbatively calculable part of the cross section from the non-perturbative part [3]. If specific particles are identified in the final state, parton fragmentation functions (FFs) appear frequently as non-perturbative ingredient of QCD factorization formulas. (In the older literatue the term parton decay functions instead of FFs was often used.) Generally, FFs describe how the color-carrying quarks and gluons transform into color-neutral particles such as hadrons or photons.",

This was in the pre-QCD era, at a time when key characteristic features of the partons, like their interactions, were heavily under debate. Early on FFs were considered as counterpart of parton distribution functions (PDFs). While PDFs were understood as probability densities for finding partons, with a given momentum, inside color-neutral particles, FFs were understood as probability densities for finding color-neutral particles inside partons [7,6].",

The parton-model representation of the cross section for the three processes is shown in Fig. 2. Using the parton model, or in other words leading order perturbative QCD (pQCD), it is often straight forward to write down a factorization formula. However, in full QCD it is typically challenging to analyze and factorize radiative corrections to arbitrary order in the strong coupling [3,13]. Factorization theorems only hold if specific kinematic conditions are satisfied, where the minimum requirement is the presence of a hard scale that allows one to use pQCD. For SIA that scale is provided by the center-of-mass (cm) energy \u221a s. For SIDIS it is the momentum transfer between the leptonic and the hadronic part of the process, while in the case of hadronic collisions it is the transverse momentum of the final state hadron relative to the collision axis. The specific form of the factorization theorem, including the precise meaning of the \"multiplication\" \u2297, also depends on the kinematics of the process. In addition, it can depend on the polarization state of one or more of the involved particles. More information on this point will be given later in this paper and the references quoted there. We also mention that the factorization theorems in Eqs. (1)-(3) hold in the sense of a Taylor expansion in powers of 1/Q, where here Q denotes the hard scale of a process. The term on the r.h.s. of these equations then represents the leading contribution. Factorization theorems have been written down for certain subleading terms as well, but in most such cases all-order proofs do not exist.",

All the FFs that emerge when making such generalizations are important in their own as they contain a lot of information about non-perturbative QCD dynamics in general, and the hadronization process in particular. In a number of cases they are simply needed to describe existing data. Very often they are also considered and used just as a tool for studying PDFs of hadrons, most notably of the nucleon. Especially in that regard generalizations of D h/i 1 (z) received a lot of attention over the past two decades. In this article we will discuss the following four types of FFs:",

But we also discuss the corresponding spin-dependent integrated FFs G h/i 1 (z) and H h/i 1 (z), which are needed when the hadron is polarized parallel or perpendicular to its momentum, respectively.

Such TMD FFs allow one, for instance, to probe the transverse-momentum dependence of PDFs in a process like SIDIS. By keeping the transverse momentum of the fragmentation process one also finds new FFs. Two of them already became important in high-energy spin physics, with the Collins function for quarks H \u22a5 h/q 1 representing the most prominent example [27]. At present people are interested in this function mainly because in SIDIS it couples to the transversity PDF [27], which is one of the three leading-twist collinear quark distributions of the nucleon [28,29,30]. Because of its chiral-odd nature transversity cannot be measured in inclusive DIS. As a result the present knowledge about this function is still poor compared to the other leading-twist PDFs, that is, the unpolarized distribution and the helicity distribution of partons.",

Another subclass parameterizes quark-gluon-quark correlation functions which can be considered as quantum interference effects. Such three-parton FFs are very important for describing several twist-3 observables like the large transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) that were observed for instance in p \u2191 p \u2192 hX.

There are some important related topics that we cannot cover at all. One of them is parton fragmentation in a strongly interacting medium such as nuclear matter or the quark-gluon plasma. More information on this research area can be found, e.g., in Refs. [39,51,52,53]. Also, we do not consider heavy-quark FFs. The fragmentation into a heavy quark can be computed perturbatively [54,39], but the transition from the heavy quark into a heavy-flavored hadron contains non-perturbative effects. Several parameterizations of such effects exist in the literature [55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62].",

The observables that can be used to extract the FFs are summarized in Sec. 3. This is followed by Sec. 4 which contains an overview of the different experiments and datasets that are relevant for the defined observables, along with the most important results. In Sec. 5, we discuss the efforts to extract FFs from the experimental results through global fits, and in Sec. 6 models for FFs are briefly presented. Section 7 contains several topics that are important for the field of FFs, but cannot be discussed at length in this review. This applies in particular to FFs for polarized hadrons, which mainly matter for hyperon production. While in Sec. 2 we summarize most of the properties of the FFs relevant in this case, any additional discussion on this topic is limited to a few paragraphs in Sec. 7. The conclusions and an outlook are given in Sec. 8.",

We largely follow the so-called Amsterdam notation for FFs [63,66,65,67]. The relation to the so-called Torino notation, which has also been used frequently, is discussed for instance in [68,69]. The focus is on fragmentation into spin- 1 2 hadrons, q(k) h(P h , S h ) Figure 3: Representation of the correlator \u2206 h/q in (8), which describes the fragmentation of a quark into a hadron. The figure contains no reference to the Wilson lines. which of course also covers the important case of fragmentation into spin-0 hadrons. In the case of DiFFs we only consider spin-0 hadrons. Work on the classification of FFs for spin-1 hadrons can be found in [70,71,72].",

Since P \u2212 h and k \u2212 are large, the two quark fields are separated along the (conjugate) light-cone plus-direction. Wilson lines are included in (8) in order to ensure color gauge invariance of the correlator \u2206 h/q .

These two Wilson lines can be combined into a single Wilson line which directly connects the two quark fields through a straight line. The same situation appears for integrated two-parton PDFs. Keeping the two Wilson lines in (8) makes the notation somewhat more \"symmetric\" and, in particular, reveals the similarity to the definition of TMD FFs discussed below. Additionally, we point out that in particular through the Wilson lines, \u2206 h/q in (8) also depends on the vectorn. For simplicity this dependence is not displayed. Moreover, we have suppressed the dependence of \u2206 h/q on a renormalization scale \u00b5, which is caused by the renormalization of the two quark field operators and a divergence arising from the integration upon the transverse quark momentum [12]. We will return to this point in Sec. 2.7 when discussing the evolution of FFs. For the following discussion it is convenient to introduce a shorthand notation for the trace of \u2206 h/q with an arbitrary Dirac matrix \u0393 [63],",

Time-reversal does not impose a constraint on the number of allowed FFs because the state |P h , S h ; X in (8) is an out-state which includes all the interactions between the particles [27]. Time-reversal, however, does transform out-states into in-states of non-interacting particles, and therefore the correlator is transformed into an unrelated object. If one ignored the difference between in-states and out-states, three of the twist-3 FFs above (E L , D T , H) were forbidden due to time-reversal invariance of the strong interaction [27,74]. Therefore, these functions are called na\u00efve T-odd. Even though na\u00efve T-odd FFs can exist because of interactions between particles, they are nonzero only if the amplitude describing the fragmentation q \u2192 hX has a minimum of two different components with at least one of them having an imaginary part. This feature is also clearly seen in model-calculations [27,76]. Additional discussion on the application of time-reversal to FFs can be found in [36,12]. Now we consider the case of antiquarks. One can define antiquark FFs by means of (Dirac traces of) the correlator [63,73,77] ",

Transverse gauge links like those on the r.h.s. in (36), (37) are crucial for a proper gauge-invariant definition of TMD correlation functions as was first pointed out in Refs. [81,82]. The future-pointing Wilson lines in (36), (37) naturally appear for the correlation function when deriving factorization in e + e \u2212 annihilation. For SIDIS, a priori, factorization seemed to require past-pointing Wilson lines instead, i.e., the replacement of all occurrences of \u221e + in the gauge links by \u2212\u221e + [80]. However, later on in Ref. [83] it was shown that factorization can actually be derived for both e + e \u2212 annihilation and SIDIS using, for instance, future-pointing Wilson lines. This result is intimately connected with the universality of TMD FFs, a point which will be discussed in a bit more detail in Sec. 2.6. Also, like for the integrated correlator in (8), we have suppressed a dependence of \u2206 h/q in (35) on the light-cone vectorn and on a renormalization scale \u00b5, where here the latter merely is due to renormalization of the quark fields [12]. An additional complication in the case of TMDs are the infamous light-cone singularities which show up when evaluating the TMD correlator in (35) (or the corresponding correlator for TMD PDFs) in perturbation theory by including gauge field degrees of freedom -see for instance [10,84]. These singularities arise as a consequence of the kinematical (eikonal) approximation that is made when deriving factorization for higher-order diagrams and which leads to the Wilson line in the parton correlator. In fact, they already appear at the one-loop level. For k T integrated parton correlators the light-cone singularties cancel after summing over real and virtual loop corrections [10], however there is no such cancellation for TMDs. Like UV divergences, these divergences need to be regularized, but this cannot be achieved using dimensional regularization [85].",

The aforementioned light-cone singularities in the TMD FFs as defined above do cancel between real and virtual diagrams when performing the k T integral, which implies that the integrated FFs are free of such divergences [10,84]. On the other hand, if one first regularizes the light-cone singularities of TMD FFs, and afterwards performs the k T integration one no longer has simple relations of the type (41)-(43) -see for instance [86,12]. Moreover, the transverse momentum integrals in (41)-(43) contain UV divergences. We understand that UV divergences on the l.h.s. and on the r.h.s. of these equations are dealt with in exactly the same manner. For later convenience we also define the following k T moments of a generic FF X h/q ,",

It is rather taken for granted that, for instance, D h/q 1 (z) is the same in processes like e + e \u2212 annihilation, SIDIS, and hadronic collisions. However, the question about universality of TMD FFs is nontrivial. This point becomes immediately obvious if one recalls the universality properties of TMD PDFs, in particular the prediction that the Sivers function [141,142] and the Boer-Mulders function [143] change sign between SIDIS and the Drell-Yan process [144]. In SIDIS these functions have future-pointing Wilson lines, while for Drell-Yan they have past-pointing Wilson lines. Though one is dealing with different operator definitions in the two reactions, time-reversal in combination with the parity transformation can be used to relate the definitions, which implies a sign change in the case of na\u00efve T-odd TMD PDFs [144]. TMD FFs have future-pointing Wilson lines in e + e \u2212 annihilation, while in SIDIS they have, a priori, past-pointing Wilson lines. Unlike the case of parton distributions, TMD FFs in the two reactions cannot be related via time-reversal (see also the discussion after Eq. (25)). Therefore, initially it seemed that they are not universal and even entirely unrelated when comparing e + e \u2212 annihilation and SIDIS.",

(When deriving TMD factorization one needs to consider leading-twist contributions from (i) hard-gluon emission, (ii) gluon emission that is collinear to the external hadrons, and (iii) soft-gluon emission. In the case of collinear factorization soft-gluon effects cancel when adding real and virtual diagrams, but there is no such cancellation for TMD factorization. This is part of the reason why results in collinear factorization are typically simpler than in TMD factorization.) The soft factor is essentially a vacuum expectation value of four Wilson lines, where in the case of SIDIS two of them, a priori, are future-pointing and two are past-pointing, while for e + e \u2212 annihilation for instance all four Wilson lines are future-pointing. Time-reversal does again not allow to relate the two objects, but still one can show that they are identical [83]. A very recent explicit two-loop calculation of the soft factor [148,149] is fully compatible with the universality of this object. It was also argued these fixed-order results might generalize to all orders in perturbation theory [150,151,149].",

This was first shown in a lowest-order spectator model calculation [153], and later on in a model-independent way [154,155] (see also the work in [102]). The specific moments of TMD FFs that appear on the l.h.s. of (92) are therefore universal. Similar to (92) one may relate higher k T moments of TMD FFs to certain collinear multi-parton correlators where the number of partons increases with increasing power of k T . By means of the methods of Ref. [154] or of Ref. [155] one finds that these multi-parton correlators vanish as well [156,155]. The benefit of such a (formal) study is, however, not immediately obvious as higher k T moments of TMD FFs are severely plagued by UV divergences and rapidity divergences.",

This relation can also be traced back to the so-called Drell-Levy-Yan relation between structure functions in DIS and in e + e \u2212 \u2192 hX [166,167,168]. In Ref. [169] this point has been discussed in some detail. The NLO splitting functions P (1) ji were computed in [170,171,172,173,174,175]. Though they differ from their space-like counterparts one can still relate them by a suitable analytical continuation [170,171,172,175,169,176]. In the meantime even the NNLO time-like splitting functions have been studied. Specifically, the function P (2) qq that is needed for the non-singlet evolution was computed in [177], while P (2) gg was obtained in [178]. The off-diagonal splitting functions P (2) qg and P (2) gq were derived in [179] by making also use of the momentum sum rule in (89) and the super-symmetric limit. An uncertainty still exists for P (2) qg which, however, is not very important numerically [179].

This problem can be solved by including in the definition a soft factor -basically the same object we talked about above in Sec. 2.6. Here we will not present any equations for such new definitions and just refer to the literature -see [84,86,181,12,182,147,183] and references therein. We merely mention that the soft factor alone contains a light-cone singularity which, in the mentioned modified TMD definition, just cancels the corresponding singularity of the correlator in (35). It is important that the presence of the soft factor in the definition of TMD FFs (and TMD PDFs) is actually well motivated from a different perspective. Cross sections for processes that are sensitive to transverse parton momenta typically also contain uncancelled leadingtwist contributions from soft-gluon emission -see also the related discussion in Sec. 2.6. In a proper definition of TMD correlators the soft factor enters in such a way that there is no double-counting of soft-gluon contributions. Therefore, this factor cures two problems at the same time.",

A priori, all the Wilson lines that appear in the soft factor are light-like, but this leads to an additional divergence, which can be regularized by taking one of them somewhat off the light-cone. The scale \u03b6 is directly related to the direction (rapidity) of that Wilson line. The resulting \u03b6 dependence is governed by an evolution equation that is typically written for the Fourier transform of the FFs [184],",

(In most of the literature on TMD evolution that distance is denoted by b T rather than \u03be T used in (35). Therefore we adapt this convention here.) The TMD evolution equation does not show a mixing between a certain quark type and other quark flavors or gluons. (The l.h.s. of (95) is basically just a derivative with respect to the direction of a Wilson line, which does not introduce mixing.) This is different from the more familiar case of DGLAP evolution in Eq. (93) for forward FFs. However, mixing between different partons comes in when deriving final solutions for the TMD evolution equation. Here one has to keep in mind that for small distances b T the TMDs can be computed perturbatively, which introduces parton mixing. In order to maximize the information one can obtain from pQCD one includes such small b T results in the solution for TMDs. The large b T part of TMDs has to be fitted to data. Let us also add a few words on the scale \u00b5 as it appears in DGLAP evolution and on the scale \u03b6. While in a first place \u00b5 is arbitrary, it must be chosen of the same order as Q, with Q indicating here the large scale of a physical process. Otherwise one obtains large logarithms that  spoil the convergence of the perturbative expansion. For instance at one-loop one finds terms of the type \u03b1 s ln \u00b5 Q which would become large once \u00b5 and Q are very different even if \u03b1 s were small. The same reasoning applies to \u03b6, for which one typically picks \u221a \u03b6 \u223c Q [12,182] in order to have a well-behaved perturbation series.",

Expressions for the quantity K(b T , \u00b5) as well as the anomalous dimensions \u03b3 D and \u03b3 K can be found, for instance, in [12,182]. The Fourier transforms of all three correlators in Eqs. (38)-(40) obey the evolution equations (95) and (96). The equations are solved in b T space, and then one transforms back to k T space. Numerically the evolution of the various TMD FFs differs, not the least because they enter in (38)-(40) with different prefactors in k T . For gluon TMD FFs one has the same structure of the evolution equations, but the evolution kernels are different. Evolution of TMD FFs has been studied in a number of recent works [12,182,186,187,188,189,190,191,151,192,193,185,194]. Since the Fourier transform from b T space to k T space also involves the region of large distances, the final result of the evolution depends on non-perturbative physics which needs to be parameterized. At present the largest numerical uncertainty for TMD evolution is related to the freedom of modelling the non-perturbative part of TMDs in b T space -see [195,196,188,191,190,197,198] and references therein. In Fig. 6 TMD evolution is shown for the favored unpolarized TMD FF and the Collins function. The general feature of TMD evolution is that TMD distributions get broadened as one goes to larger scales. This holds for all the different studies in the literature, but the magnitude of this broadening can differ considerably.",

Similar to the access to gluon PDFs from scaling violations, D h/g 1 can also be addressed via its contribution to the evolution of the FFs -see Eq. (93). Given the weak (logarthmic) scale dependence one is left with large uncertainties. Information on gluon FFs can also be extracted by considering three jet events which, however, requires a more complicated theoretical apparatus. The other issue that one encounters when using Eq.

The most detailled recent works in this area exclusively used data on SIDIS -either cross sections or multiplicities that depend on the transverse momentum of the final state hadron. However, even in a LO treatment the total hadron's transverse momentum is generated by both the transverse momentum of the active quark relative to the proton and the transverse momentum of the hadron relative to the quark. The same complication in principle applies to the production of two back-to-back hadrons in e + e \u2212 annihilation, where the total transverse momentum of one hadron relative to the other is given by the transverse momentum dependence of the two involved FFs. However, given that essentially the same TMD FF appears twice in the cross section one may get new valuable information from this observable, especially when looking at different combinations of hadrons. At present there exists no suitable data that allow one to carry out such an analysis, but work along those lines is in progress. Another way to address the transverse momentum dependence of FFs is by observing hadrons plus the jet from which they originate, similar to what we discussed above in Sec. 3.1.3 for the integrated FF D h/i 1 (z) [235] -see for instance [232] for a related discussion. In a LO calculation such an observable gives direct access to TMD FFs, while the situation is less clean once higher order corrections are included. Further developments in this area can be expected. On the experimental side, there has been some effort to correct measured jet quantities on partonic quantities that can be calculated by using simulations from a program like PYTHIA [239], but this introduces model dependence and theoretical uncertainties since it is difficult to match results from Monte-Carlo event generators onto a fixed-order calculation.",

This correlation obviously vanishes if the quark and the hadron move collinearly. Note that only the transverse quark spin matters, that is, the component of s T which is perpendicular to the quark momentum k. In this section, we describe observables related to the Collins FF in e + e \u2212 annihilation, SIDIS, and pp scattering. Since the Collins function is chiral-odd, in an observable it can only appear in combination with another chiral-odd non-perturbative function. While the chiral-odd partner can be H \u22a5 1 itself in back-to-back hadron production in e + e \u2212 annihilation, in SIDIS and pp the Collins FF appears together with chiral-odd PDFs, which themselves are only poorly known.

However, the correlation of the spins of the qq pair produced in the decay of the virtual photon leads to an azimuthal correlation of two hadrons produced in opposite hemispheres. The sign of the Collins function cannot be fixed using this observable. On the other hand, like for D h/q 1 , the freedom in choosing charge and flavor for the hadrons can be used to access different combinations of favored and disfavored FFs. This will be described in more detail in Sec. 5.3. The term in Eq. (112) containing the Collins function can be extracted by dividing the \u03c6 0 dependent cross section by the azimuthally averaged cross section. Since Eq. (112) defines an unpolarized cross section one cannot cancel systematic effects in the way done for spin asymmetries. Instead experiments exploit the flavor dependence of H \u22a5 h/q 1 and use so-called double ratios between the normalized cross section of different charge combinations, which are described in Sec. 4.5.3. The B(y) term in (112) implies that the term containing the Collins function is maximal if the qq axis, which approximately coincides with the thrust axis of the event, is perpendicular to the lepton axis. This is advantageous since measurements in the central region of the detector are much easier than in the forward/backward region.",

It was found that A N \u223c \u03b1 s m q /| P h\u22a5 |, where \u03b1 s arises from 1-loop corrections that are needed to generate an imaginary part on the amplitude level [253]. Another suppression comes form the quark mass m q . Since this result was much too small for explaining data on A N available at that time, the authors of Ref. [253] even speculated that (perturbative) QCD may be incorrect. However, that conclusion was not justified. The calculation in [253] had just shown that A N , unlike the unpolarized cross section, is a genuine twist-3 observable since there is a contribution proportional to the quark mass. (One can readily understand why A N cannot be a twist-2 observable. At twist-2, necessarily the transversity PDF h 1 of the transversely-polarized proton and the unpolarized PDF f 1 of the unpolarized proton enter the factorized cross section. Since h 1 is chiral-odd one needs another non-perturbative chiral-odd parton correlator in order to get a nonzero result. This could only be provided by the fragmentation process. However, at twist-2 there is no chiral-odd (collinear) FF for fragmentation into unpolarized hadrons. Put differently, the helicity structure of the hard scattering cross section for A N does not allow a twist-2 effect.) In fact it was pointed out early on that threeparton correlations have to be taken into account for a proper description of A N in QCD [254,255]. The framework used in [254,255] is collinear twist-3 factorization. This approach was discussed in detail in Ref. [256,257], and later also successfully applied to A N in hadronic collisions -see, e.g. Here we will just discuss the overall outcome of a calculation of A N in collinear twist-3 factorization and skip all technical details. For the process p(P a , S a ) + p(P b ) \u2192 h(P h ) + X the spin-dependent cross section takes the generic form [96] ",

The part in (125) that is related to the Collins function was computed in [95], while the complete result was obtained in [96]. The leading order calculation of all the terms in (124) includes several hundred Feynman graphs. The corresponding evaluation of A N in p \u2191 \u2192 hX is much simpler in comparison, and a full analytical result can be found in [263]. In that case one of course only has twist-3 effects associated with the transversely polarized nucleon and with the parton fragmentation. The transverse SSA A N also exists for polarization in the final state and has been studied in processes like pp \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X.

The generic structure of the numerator of the asymmetry coincides with the expression in (124). For lepton-nucleon scattering the analytical result for A LT can be found in Ref. [107], where the final expression for the twist-3 fragmentation part only contains the FF E h/q defined in (17). A measurement of A LT using a polarized 3 He-target was performed at Jefferson-Lab [276]. At present, it is not possible to draw any strong conclusion from comparing the data of [276] with a numerical estimate given in [107]. In the case of pp scattering a basically complete analytical result for A LT is available as well [277,278,279]. Currently, no data exist for this observable, and RHIC would be the only facility in the world that could perform such a measurement. Given the pioneering character of a potential experimental study, plus the fact that in the past measurements of the \"partner\" twist-3 observable A N gave rise to strong surprises, it would be worthwhile to pursue activities along those lines.",

Similar to the single-hadron TMD FFs one can also consider the transverse momentum dependence of DiFFs. However, in the following we will restrict ourselves to observables that do not vanish when integrated over k T . The DiFFs contributing to these observables are functions of the fractional energy z and the invariant mass of the hadron pair M h . At large M h , the DiFFs can be computed in pQCD and expressed in terms of single hadron FFs [282] (see also Ref. [139]). Here we are mainly concerned with dihadron production for small M h .",

[283] used the coordinate system shown in Fig. 8, where the azimuthal angles of the vectors R a , R b are measured around the axis given by the jet momentum vectors. This axis is approximately equal to the thrust axis, so this situation basically corresponds to using the coordinate system for the single hadron asymmetry shown on the right of Fig. 7. Instead in [121] a coordinate system is employed in which P hb = P b1 + P b2 defines the axis around which the azimuthal angles are measured. This asymmetric coordinate system thus corresponds to the situation on the left of Fig. 7. In both cases, using the parton model approximation, one can write the cross section for the back-to-back production of hadron pairs as (126) with A(y), B(y) from (114). The term containing H 1 can then be extracted from the cos(\u03c6 Ra + \u03c6 Rb ) modulation of the crosr section.

            "text": "Electron-positron annihilation experiments play a special role in the study of FFs since they provide clean access to light-quark FFs. Up until recently, most global extractions of FFs relied mainly on e + e \u2212 data -see Sec. 5 for more details. Since the first e + e \u2212 collider AdA at Frascati in the early 1960s, there has been a long history of e + e \u2212 experiments, which have been instrumental in fundamental discoveries in particle physics. In particular the data taken at facilities at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the US, at the Japanese High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), at DESY in Germany, as well as by the LEP experiments at CERN, allowed the precision study of FFs. A comprehensive review of the data collected up to 1995 at PETRA, PEP, TRISTAN, SLC, and LEP can be found in [340], while a collection of datapoints from later measurements can be found on the Durham HEP database [341]. The first collider ring at SLAC was SPEAR operating at 7.4 GeV, which provided the first collisions at the MARK-I experiment in 1973 [342] leading to the discovery of the J/\u03a8 and the \u03c4 lepton. It was followed by the Positron-Electron-Project (PEP) collider ring, which collected data at \u221a s = 29 GeV from 1980 to 1990. PEP in turn was succeeded by the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC), which came online in 1987 and which delivered 20 pb \u22121 at the Z 0 mass between 1989 and 1998. A unique feature of SLC was that the electron beam could be longitudinally polarized, which allowed the separation of the fragmentation products from quarks and antiquarks coming from the decay of the Z 0 due to the parity violation of the weak force. More recently, PEP-II was in operation at SLAC, which was a B-factory operating at or near the \u03a5(4S) resonance from 1998 until 2008. At KEK, the TRISTAN e + e \u2212 storage ring operated starting in 1986 at cm energies between 50 GeV and 64 GeV. Similar to the development at SLAC, it was succeeded by the B-factory KEKB which started data taking in 1999 and achieved world record instantaneous luminosities of more than 2.11 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . KEKB delivered its last beam in 2010 and is currently being upgraded to SuperKEKB with a target luminosity of 40 times that of KEKB. The B-factories operated at SLAC and KEK and delivered record amounts of integrated luminosity at an energy relatively close to the relevant scales of the SIDIS and pp experiments. Together with the precision instrumentation -the Belle and BaBar experiments described below -operated at these machines, the B-factories are arguably the best places to study FFs in e + e \u2212 and have provided the most important results over the last decade.",

All following general purpose e + e \u2212 experiments used similar instrumentation with a TPC or drift chamber as the main tracking and PID detector, together with electromagnetic calorimetry, muon identification and, as technology progressed, silicon vertex detectors. Other experiments at PEP from which data relevant for the study of FFs are available are HRS and MARK-II, where the later already collected data at SPEAR and would be used at SLC as well. Operating at the SLC were the MARK-II [342] and SLD experiments [344] collecting 20 pb \u22121 at the Z mass. Part of the data was taken with a 75% linearly polarized electron beam to separate quark and antiquark fragmentation. It is worth mentioning that in particular SLD had good PID capabilities with its central drift chamber and its Cherenkov ring imaging detector. Finally, the BaBar collaboration was operating the experiment [345] with the same name at the B-factory PEP-II, accumulating 557 fb \u22121 of data.",

            "text": "Data from SIDIS experiments with polarized targets is in particular important for the extraction of polarization-dependent FFs. Additionally, data taken with effective proton or neutron targets provides information on the flavor dependence of the fragmentation process in the polarized as well as the spinaveraged case. Heavier target materials can be used to study in-medium fragmentation. Because the longitudinal momentum of the fragmenting quark at leading order can be reconstructed in leptonnucleon scattering, data from SIDIS experiments is also valuable to extract the z dependence of FFs. Even though the transverse momentum of the initial state cannot be accessed, measuring the P h\u22a5 dependence in SIDIS can provide valuable information to extract the transverse momentum dependence of PDFs and FFs when combined with e + e \u2212 data. We will concentrate on the experiments at DESY and CERN, since the data taken up to now at JLab with a 6 GeV electron beam is not used for the extraction of FFs due to the low cm energy. HERA was the only accelerator in the world able to collide protons with either electrons or protons. It was operational between 1992 and 2007, providing a proton beam up to 920 GeV and electron or positron beams at 27.5 GeV. It hosted the H1 [368] and ZEUS [369] experiments which were located at the interaction points of the lepton and hadron beams, whereas the HERMES [370] experiment used internal fixed gaseous polarized and unpolarized targets that could be brought into the lepton beam. At CERN, the M2 beamline provided a secondary muon beam to a dynasty of experiments since the late 70's starting with the European Muon Collaboration (EMC), the New Muon Collaboration (NMC) the Spin Muon Collaboration (SMC) to the current generation, the COMPASS experiment. For the study of FFs, in particular precision data from COMPASS and HERMES are of importance, since H1 and ZEUS lacked precise PID capabilities and thus did not make the study of FFs a focus of their research program. However, ZEUS and H1 published data on unidentified charged hadron multiplicities, as well as fragmentation into K 0 S and heavy quarks. With \u221a s = 318 GeV, ZEUS and H1 represent the energy frontier for SIDIS experiments. In contrast to this HERMES operated at \u221a s = 5.2 GeV only, which implies that the applicability of pQCD calculations to this data has to be carefully evaluated even with the Q 2 > 1 GeV cut that is usually applied. The same argument applies to a lesser degree to the COMPASS and EMC data. The COMPASS data which are relevant for this review was taken with a 160 GeV muon beam. There is some data from EMC on hadron multiplicities available that has been taken at even higher muon-beam energies of up to 280 GeV. HERMES consisted of a forward spectrometer providing good tracking capability with relative momentum resolutions between 1.5% and 2.5%. A dual radiator ring imaging Cherenkov counter was used to provide good particle separation for momenta between 2 GeV and 15 GeV [371]. Additionally, a pre-shower detector was used for hadron/lepton separation as well as a transition radiation detector and a lead-glass calorimeter. For the extraction of light-quark FFs the data collected with polarized and unpolarized proton and deuterium targets are of interest. Average polarizations of around 85% were achieved with both targets. On the other hand, the COMPASS [372] setup was using the 160 GeV muon beam on solid polarized deuterium ( 6 LiD) and proton (NH 3 ) targets. The two-stage spectrometer covers a wide momentum range with Q 2 values up to about 100 GeV 2 . In addition to a muon wall and electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetery, PID is provided by a RICH detector that enables charged \u03c0/K separation up to momenta of 40 GeV. The availability of transversely polarized targets, good PID, and both proton and deuteron targets allowed both collaborations to study the spin and flavor dependence in the fragmentation of pions, kaons, and neutral mesons. As noted above, there are some results from COMPASS predecessor experiments (SMC and EMC) available. However, the newer COMPASS results supersede these, so that they do not play a large role in current analysis of FFs with the exception of a small dataset from EMC that will be discussed in the results section.",

            "text": "There exists a long history of experiments studying pp collisions, in particular with fixed targets such as the experiments UA2, AFS, WA70, UA1 at CERN's ISR and SPS. For the study of FFs, the data with the most impact comes from experiments at the Tevatron, RHIC and, more recently, the LHC. As with the e + e \u2212 and SIDIS configurations, the modern experiments used analysis techniques which are more amenable to modern global fits. They also collected far more data, and the experimental capabilities are much improved. In particular, the experiments that focus on heavy-ion physics, like STAR [373] at RHIC and ALICE [374] at the LHC, have very good PID. In addition to poorer instrumentation, older (fixed-target) pp data collected at lower energies pose problems for QCD fits, since the large x F and x T = P hT 2 \u221a s accessed can imply significant higher-order corrections as already mentioned in Sec. 3. Therefore, below we will only describe the Tevatron, RHIC and LHC experiments. At cm energies of about 1 TeV (Tevatron), 62.4, 200 and 500 GeV (RHIC) and 7 TeV (LHC), these pp machines provide the necessary phase space to extract FFs in a factorized QCD framework. RHIC is the only machine that is able to provide polarized, both longitudinally and transversely, protons. Both RHIC and LHC collected data in proton-nucleus collisions allowing to probe nuclear effects in fragmentation, which are not a focus of this review. The main experiments at the Tevatron were CDF [375,376] and D0 [377]. Both of these were optimized for jet physics and were lacking good PID capabilities for pions and kaons. Therefore the data was mostly used for studies of heavy-quark fragmentation and jet fragmentation, both of which are not covered in this review. At RHIC, the main experiments are PHENIX [378] and STAR [373]. In particular, STAR with a central TPC is well equipped to identify charged hadrons and reconstruct jets in its barrel region, which covers a pseudorapidity region of about \u22121 < \u03b7 < 1. PHENIX is well suited to detect electromagnetic energy from neutral mesons (\u03c0 0 and \u03b7) in the central region |\u03b7| < 0.35. In the forward region, both experiments have electromagnetic calorimeters which allows the reconstruction of neutral mesons and purely electromagnetic jets. PHENIX covers roughly the range 3 < \u03b7 < 4, whereas STAR's coverage is 2 < \u03b7 < 4. At the LHC, the ATLAS [379] and CMS [380] experiments are again optimized for physics with jets and leptons at mid-rapidity, whereas the ALICE experiment which focuses on heavy-ion physics, similar to STAR, has a TPC at its center which allows to study the fragmentation of identified hadrons. However, so far ALICE recorded relatively little pp data [381] so that the precision of the data collected at high enough p T is small compared to RHIC. In the future, data relevant for the study of FFs might also come from the LHCb [382] experiment, which covers the region 2 < \u03b7 < 5 with high-precision tracking, PID and calorimetry. The LHC experiments also provided a wealth of data on heavy-flavor production which, however, is not a focus of this review.",

In particular, we consider the SIA process described in Eq. (98). Here we have results for unidentified charged hadrons available that were taken over a wide range of energies (3 GeV \u2264 \u221a s \u2264 183 GeV) at the facilities described above. A compilation of inclusive particle production data taken till the mid '90s, so excluding the B-factory data, can be found in [340]. Significant data that is used in modern extractions of FFs of non-identified charged hadrons and neutral mesons is available from the TPC, TASSO, SLD, TOPAZ experiments [340]. Looking for identified hadrons, the number of available datasets shrinks somewhat, but since older experiments are anyway not that important for the extraction of FFs for the reasons outlined earlier this is not very concerning. At the highest energies, we have pion and kaon multiplicities or cross sections from the LEP experiments DELPHI [303], ALEPH [301] and OPAL [308] which had charged-particle identification. Similar data exists from SLD [299] which, as mentioned above, also took data with a longitudinally polarized beam. At intermediate energies, we have datasets on identified pions and kaons from the TPC/two-gamma experiment [291,289,383] and from TASSO [294]. The most precise measurements by far on identified pion, kaon and proton cross sections have been done at the B-factories by the Belle [317,318] and BaBar experiments [320]. Looking at datasets for neutral light mesons, which means for us \u03c0 0 and \u03b7, we have results from the LEP experiments ALEPH [384,385,386], L3 [387,388] and OPAL [389]. From BaBar we also have available preliminary results on \u03b7 meson multiplicities [319]. Fig. 9 shows a selection of world data on the cross section for identified pions measured at SLD, DELPHI, ALEPH, TASSO, TPC/Two-gamma, Belle, CLEO, ARGUS and MARK-II [390]. The data covers a wide range in \u221a s, and it illustrates the role the B-factories play in the study of fragmentation measurements with an improvement of the achieved precision by several orders of magnitude. This, in particular, allows to map out FFs also at high z, a kinematic region previously not accessible. While generally in SIA it is  challenging to address FFs for individual quark flavors, the lever arm in energy also helps in order to exploit the different coupling strengths of \u03b3 * and Z 0 and thus gain some flavor sensitivity.",

We already mentioned the SLD analysis [225] with a polarized electron beam using the parity-violating coupling of the weak interaction as described in Sec. 3.1. Another approach is to tag the flavor of the jet, either based on the leading hadron in the jet to differentiate between different light quark flavors or tag heavy-quark fragmentation by identifying mesons containing heavy quarks, like D and B mesons, using displaced vertices and/or their reconstruction from decay products. An example for flavor tagging using the leading hadron is the OPAL analysis in Ref. [307], whereas the SLD analysis in [299] is an example for a heavy-flavor-tagged analysis. The performed flavor tagging, in particular using the leading hadron, can only be interpreted at the lowest order in pQCD calculations and therefore does not play a role in current fits of FFs [132].",

As described earlier in Sec. 3.5, the caveat of this observable is that at NLO it also receives contributions from the convolution of single-hadron FFs [139]. The (perturbative) single-hadron FF contribution and DiFF contributions might be separated if the invariant mass of the two-hadron system is measured [282]. This second scale then could allow a separation of the perturbative contribution (for large M h ) and the non-perturbative contribution. In addition to tagging specific quark flavors, there was also an effort to understand differences in quark and gluon jets at LEP using three-jet events where two of the jets could be identified as coming from quarks by tagging bottom quarks [391,309,392,393]. We also want to mention that the observation that gluon jets are in general broader than quark jets has implications for the study of gluons in, e.g.. SIDIS experiments: Switching to SIDIS, the relevant observables often are cross sections for hadron production off fixed targets which are sensitive to D h/q 1 coupled to the respective PDFs as seen in Eqs. (104) and (105). Note that instead of the hadron production cross section, experiments often measure multiplicities, where the SIDIS cross section is normalized to the total DIS cross section. In this ratio, quantities that might not be known precisely, like the delivered luminosity, cancel.",

The HERA experiments reach low scaled momenta in the current fragmentation region which allows the test of models for the so-called modified leading-log approximation (MLLA) -see Sec. 7.3 for more details -and comparison to e + e \u2212 experiments. EMC published results for both \u00b5p and \u00b5d scattering, whereas COMPASS only showed the results obtained with their isoscalar target. Identified pions and kaons have been measured by EMC [396], HERMES [322], and most recently COMPASS [397]. Like the earlier EMC results, HERMES used both proton and deuteron targets, whereas COMPASS shows again only results from an isoscalar target. COMPASS, like the earlier EMC analysis, also performs a LO extraction of the favored and disfavored pion FFs which are in reasonable agreement with NLO extractions using the DSS, HKNS and LSS frameworks that will be discussed in detail in Sec. 5.1. The HERMES results are shown in Fig. 10. pp experiments: Data from pp collisions is essential to constrain the gluon FF because constraints derived from scaling violations in SIA datasets at different energies are usually not strong enough to determine the gluon FF with a similar precision as the light-quark FFs. This is quite impressively illustrated by comparing the extractions that do not use pp data with those that do. Section 5 will discuss two examples: HKNS [398] which relies solely on SIA data, and DSS [132] which also includes SIDIS and pp data. The extracted gluon FFs are shown in Figs. 21 and 22. Similar to e + e \u2212 annihilation, there is a long history of pp scattering experiments, in particular with fixed targets. In fact, the first fragmentation models from Feynman and Field [399] were developed using pp data from CERN's ISR. However, most older fixed-target pp data are at relatively low transverse momenta and/or high x F . In this kinematic regime, higher-order corrections are normally substantial, and therefore the data is not used in modern global fits since higher-precision data from RHIC and the LHC became available, which also provide good PID. In particular, high-precision data on \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 production is available from PHENIX.",

Results were published for the cross section of \u03c0 0 at mid-rapidity at cm energies 62.4 GeV [400], 200 GeV [324], and 510 GeV [329], as well as for \u03b7 meson cross sections at mid-rapidity at 200 GeV [326]. In the forward region, PHENIX analyzed \u03b7 cross sections at 200 GeV [328]. In addition to the neutral mesons, PHENIX also measured charged-hadron cross sections at 62.4 GeV [325] and charged-pion cross sections at 200 GeV [327], both at mid-rapidity. STAR also published results on the cross section at 200 GeV of \u03c0 0 's at mid-rapidity [333], intermediate rapidity [335], as well as forward rapidity [334]. The later result also contains the cross section for \u03b7. It should be mentioned that the forward results from both STAR and PHENIX are at relatively large x F (up to x F = 0.75), which again makes it difficult to analyze them using fixed-order pQCD calculations. Compared to PHENIX, STAR has superior charged particle tracking and identification capabilities at midrapidity (|\u03b7| < 1) provided by its TPC and published results on multiplicities for identified pions, protons and kaons [330,401]. A compilation of the STAR results of \u03c0 0 cross sections, taken at different mean pseudorapidity \u03b7, are shown in Fig. 11.",

ALICE measured the cross section of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 production at \u221a s = 0.9 GeV and 7 TeV [336], as well as unidentified charged hadrons [402]. There are also preliminary results on identified charged pions and kaons [403]. Given the low integrated luminosity,  Figure 12: Results on the measurement of hadrons in jets by CMS. Left panel: transverse momentum distribution of the leading and subleading jet. Right panel: dependence of the hadrons within the jet on the variable \u03b6, which is related to z by \u03b6 = ln( 1 z ). In this case z designates the fractional momentum of the hadron along the jet axis with respect to the jet momentum. Figure reprinted from  [405]. the precision at high transverse momenta is quite low though. The ATLAS experiment published multiplicities of unidentified charged hadrons at 900 GeV, 2.76 TeV, and 7 TeV from significantly larger datasets [404]. A new development is the measurement of hadrons in jets at the LHC which, in a leading-order framework, allows a direct access to the z dependence of FFs in pp. Fig. 12 shows the result on this observable measured at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV by the CMS experiment [405]. ATLAS did a similar analysis at 7 TeV [406]. Both RHIC and LHC are pp colliders. From pp machines we also have some results on charged-particle multiplicities. At the Tevatron, CDF has results from \u221a s = 630 GeV and 1.8 TeV [338], and from the UA1 and UA2 experiments, operating at CERN's SPS, results on unidentified hadron multiplicities have been published for cm energies between 200 GeV and 900 GeV [407,408,409].",

However, at present no data from e + e \u2212 annihilation on the transverse-momentum dependence of spinaveraged FFs is available. But analyses from Belle data of back-to-back hadrons and hadrons in jets are underway. We do have though measurements of the transverse-momentum dependence of ratios of the spin-dependent FF H \u22a5 1 and of D 1 like the one shown in Eq. (135) observed in so-called double ratios which are discussed in Sec. 4.5.3. In SIDIS, the transverse-momentum dependence of FFs can be accessed via the P h\u22a5 dependence of hadron multiplicities M h which were measured recently by the HERMES Collaboration [322] and COMPASS Collaboration [323].

At LO it can be assumed that the direct \u03b3 balances the fragmenting parton, and thus the \u03b3 \u2212 h \u00b1 correlations can be used to explore the k T dependence of D h/q 1 . The PHENIX results are consistent with a Gaussian k T dependence but also show a tail at large k T which might be consistent with what is expected from TMD evolution. A word of caution is in order here. TMD factorization is expected to be broken for the \u03b3 \u2212 h final state, like is the case for the production of back-to-back hadrons in hadronic collisions [240] -see also the brief discussion in Sec. 3.3. On the other hand, at present hardly anything is known about the numerical impact of TMD factorization breaking. In that regard such correlations in pp can actually be very helpful.",

In unpolarized e + e \u2212 though, this is not directly possible. Instead, the observables that are used are ratios of the normalized azimuthal-dependent cross sections (112), (115) for different charge combinations, so-called double ratios. This way, non-charge dependent effects from acceptance and gluon radiation cancel out, but, since the physics effect is flavor-dependent, it persists in the azimuthal dependence of the double ratio. Both, Belle and BaBar show amplitudes of the fits to the modulations of the ratios of unlike sign pion pairs over like sign pairs (A U L ) and unlike sign over charge-integrated pairs (A U C ) that correspond to the polarization-dependent FF to be extracted. For example, using double ratios of the cross section from Eq. (112), the cos(2\u03c6 0 ) modulation would be fitted to extract the values for A 0,U L and A 0,U C shown in Fig. 14. Since both, denominator and numerator of the double ratio already correspond to charge-summed products of FFs for quark and antiquark, the double ratio contains an even more involved combination of FFs that can be used as an input for the globals fits discussed in Sec. 5.

The asymmetries rise with z, confirming the naive expectation that high z hadrons carry more of the original polarization information. The asymmetries also rise with | P h\u22a5 |, fulfilling the boundary condition of a vanishing Collins effect at | P h\u22a5 | = 0, up to intermediate | P h\u22a5 | where they flatten out. For large | P h\u22a5 | one would expect the asymmetries to fall again, because at fixed \u221a s large | P h\u22a5 | correspond to low z, and at | P h\u22a5 | > 1 GeV one would expect the asymmetries to be diluted by the gluon radiation generating the large transverse momenta. However, the observed asymmetries flatten out and the acceptance of the experiment is not enough to observe the full | P h\u22a5 | shape. The asymmetries of charged \u03c0K pairs measured by BaBar are consistent with those for charged pion pairs. Interestingly, the like sign over unlike sign asymmetries for charged kaons are larger than the ones for \u03c0K or \u03c0\u03c0 pairs. This is not true for the like sign over charge-integrated asymmetries which are consistent again with the combinations involving pions. This might point to different amplitudes for the favored and disfavored kaon Collins FF. However, the double ratio receives contributions from different combinations of favored and disfavored Collins FFs of up, down and strange quarks which makes the interpretation of the result difficult. More constraints can come from SIDIS and pp measurements described below, where kaons also exhibit a different behavior than pions. The | P h\u22a5 | dependence of the asymmetry is obviously sensitive to the intrinsic transverse-momentum dependence of the TMD Collins FF. The scale dependence (TMD evolution) of the intrinsic transverse momentum of TMD quantities has recently been the focus of theoretical interest -see also Sec. 2.7.2. In this respect the recent measurement by the BES-III Collaboration of the z and | P h\u22a5 | dependence of the Collins effect at the lower cm energy of \u221a s = 3.65 GeV [414] is important to explore the effects of TMD evolution when compared to the Belle and BaBar results. Other than at high z, where the acceptance of the experiment might be biased towards a small volume in phase space, the BES-III results are consistent with calculations including TMD evolution [414].",

Other information, such as the absolute sign, is also not accessed in the e + e \u2212 correlation measurements. Instead, one can use information from SIDIS experiments with a transversely polarized target and p \u2191 p scattering, where H as discussed in Sec. 3.3. For SIDIS the relevant transverse SSA (Collins asymmetry) is schematically defined in (122). Both, HERMES and COMPASS performed measurements of Collins transverse SSA on proton targets [137,245,415,416,417] for charged pions and kaons. Fig. 15 shows the results from COMPASS for the pion and kaon asymmetries off a proton target. The results for charged pions are consistent with the HERMES proton result, which showed the Collins effect for the first time albeit with significantly lower precision. Significant asymmetries can be observed for both charges with similar magnitudes that rise with the fractional energy z the hadron is carrying as well as its transverse momentum | P h\u22a5 |. This behavior is consistent with what we saw in the e + e \u2212 results from Belle and BaBar above. The sign of the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetries are reversed and there is some hint that the \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetries are larger than the signal for \u03c0 + . This is consistent with the favored and disfavored Collins FFs being of similar magnitude and opposite sign. For the charged kaons the precision of the measurements is lower than for the pions. For both HERMES and COMPASS, the positive kaons have the same sign as the asymmetries for the \u03c0 + , but the magnitude of the kaon asymmetries seems to be larger. COMPASS sees K \u2212 asymmetries that are consistent with the pion asymmetries of the same sign, however at HERMES there are hints that K \u2212 asymmetries have the opposite sign of the \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetries. It is not quite clear what causes the behavior, but given the fact that HERMES and COMPASS are measuring at different \u221a s, this might be a higher-twist effect.",

(123). This means that the outgoing quark axis has to be reconstructed. In pp, an outgoing quark initiates a jet that can be observed and the jet axis can be taken as an approximation for the quark axis, even though this simple picture only holds at LO. In order to use these observables for an extraction of the FFs, a careful study of the connection of jet observables to quantities in QCD calculations has to be done. If one tries to do the LO identification of the jet axis with the quark axis, like is done for the observables in Sec. 3.3.3, then among the relevant systematics are the smearing of the jet axis with respect to the outgoing quark axis, the probability that a reconstructed jet matches to an outgoing quark and the change in the underlying partonic process that is caused by triggering on high-energy jets. This disadvantage of the study of FFs in pp is balanced by the access to a complementary kinematic regime, in particular at high momentum transfers compared to SIDIS experiments.",

Up to now, only the STAR experiment has observed the Collins effect for jets in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV and \u221a s = 500 GeV [421,422]. The results are shown in Fig. 16. They show a significant effect which is consistent between the two energies. So far, the STAR results are not used in global fits to the Collins FF. However, one interesting observation is that there seems to be no evidence for strong evolution effects due to TMD evolution if data points with corresponding x T and | P h\u22a5 | (called j T by STAR) are compared. Even though a cancellation between the TMD evolution effects in H \u22a5 1 and the spin-independent FF D 1 might play a role, this behavior is different from the situation at lower energies, where asymmetries measured at Belle/BaBar are significantly smaller than those measured at BES-III. However it is not quite clear if this is mainly an effect of the covered z and | P h\u22a5 | ranges. In addition to the Collins measurement, STAR has results for the \"Collins-like\" FF H \u22a5 h/g 1 , the analogue of H \u22a5 h/q 1 for the fragmentation of linearly polarized gluons. No significant signal is observed [423], which most likely is caused by the small magnitude of this particular gluon FF [251].",

            "text": "At present, the most important observable for twist-3 FFs is the single-scale transverse SSA A N discussed in Sec. 3.4. It is the simplest transverse SSA that can be defined and has been observed in lp \u2191 \u2192 hX and p \u2191 p \u2192 hX over a wide range of \u221a s. Here we will concentrate on the results in p \u2191 p where A N has been measured at high enough value of the relevant scale, that is the transverse momentum | P h\u22a5 | of the produced hadron with respect to the beam axis, such that the cross-section can be described in a factorized QCD approach. It should be mentioned though, that there are some hints that A N receives contributions from diffractive processes at RHIC energies [53]. We also mention that results from SIDIS are available as well, e.g. from HERMES [424]. Large asymmetries for \u03c0 0 but also for charged pions and kaons have been observed over a wide range of energies in the forward region where the valence quarks of the polarized protons are probed [425,426,427,428,429,430,431,432,334,433]. Fig. 17 shows a selection of world data for A N in p \u2191 p for charged and neutral pions. There are several key features of the data. Especially for the charged pions at large x F one has very significant effects, with A N becoming as large as \u00b140%. Also, when comparing A N for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 one finds, for the same kinematics, (almost) equal magnitudes but reversed signs. Another remarkable feature of the data is the virtual independence of the neutral-pion asymmetry of \u221a s of the experiment at a fixed value of x F , even though one would assume that the underlying processes might be quite different. or instance for high x F , at low \u221a s the mean | P h\u22a5 | are too low for reliable pQCD calculations. Instead the kinematic dependence of the asymmetries can be expressed solely by the Feynman variable x F , a feature that is known as x F scaling. A trend for the same scaling holds for the charged pions, however some \u221a s dependence can be observed, which seems to average out for the \u03c0 0 . Most recently, results from STAR show a persistence of the asymmetries at \u221a s = 500 GeV [434], even at transverse momenta up to about 7 GeV. (Note that in the plots in Fig. 17 the transverse hadron momentum is integrated over.) In fact, no experiment observed a significant fall-off of the asymmetries with | P h\u22a5 |, which na\u00efvely would be expected for a higher-twist observable. However, the reach in | P h\u22a5 | of existing experiments might not be high enough to observe this behavior. Asymmetries for kaons have been measured by the BRAHMS experiment at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV at forward pseudorapidities [435]. The magnitude of the kaon asymmetries are similar to the pion asymmetries, however both kaon charges exhibit the same sign. This behavior poses interesting questions about the production and fragmentation process, since the K + contains a valence quark of the parent proton, whereas the K \u2212 does not. Another asymmetry sensitive to favored strange-quark fragmentation is the A N for \u03b7 mesons. Precise measurements of this quantity at 200 GeV have been done by PHENIX [328] and STAR [334]. PHENIX sees asymmetries consistent with the \u03c0 0 , whereas STAR sees a slight enhancement of the asymmetry at large x F , however the precision is not sufficient to make a definite statement. Let us finally come back to the large magnitude of the (twist-3) A N , especially in the case of charged pions. These effects are clearly larger than, for instance, the observed twist-2 Collins asymmetry in SIDIS. They are also larger than the twist-2 longitudinal double-spin asymmetry A LL , which was measured in the same process, i.e., p p \u2192 hX, but for different proton polarizations. Based on these results one may question the convergence of the twist expansion. However, from a phenomenological point of view the twist expansion can only be studied in a meaningful way when considering leading-twist  Figure 17: Selection of world data on A N in pp for neutral and charged pions. In particular in the \u03c0 0 case, the so-called x F scaling is evident, which means that the asymmetry is almost independent of \u221a s. In general, the dependence of A N on x F is almost linear.

            "text": "Different from the results for the Collins FF, the acceptance effects are sufficiently averaged out by looking at two hadrons in the final state on each side, such that no double ratios are needed to extract the asymmetry. This means that the results directly correspond to the amplitude of the modulation of the normalized cross section in Eq. (126), i.e., the product H 1H 1 . Since H 1 is not a TMD, there is also no convolution of intrinsic transverse momenta. Therefore, the results are not shown vs | P hT |, but instead the second degree of freedom introduced by the second hadron is expressed in the invariant mass of the hadron pair M h . As is the case for the Collins effect, the asymmetries rise generally with z and exhibit almost a linear dependence on z. As function of M h the asymmetries exhibit a bit more structure. As described in Sec. 2.2 and Eq. 77, it is expected that the signal for H 1 is enhanced where amplitudes for pion pairs produced in different partial waves interfere. Some models suggest that this is the case for M h \u2248 M \u03c1 -see also Sec. 6.1. This is what is observed at Belle. However, the asymmetries do not significantly fall for M h > M \u03c1 , but rather flatten out. This is different from the results in SIDIS and pp which are shown below. One potential explanation is that at Belle energies there is a significant fraction of charm-quark production, and the resonance structure is richer with larger contributions from partial waves with non-zero orbital angular momentum at large M h . The Belle and BaBar programs on spin-dependent FFs continue. Most recently Belle showed the first measurement of azimuthal correlations in jets that are thought to be sensitive to the helicity-dependent TMD DiFF G \u22a5",

The relevant spin-dependent cross section is shown in Eq 129, and the experimental observable is again a transverse SSA. HERMES was the first experiment to observe a significant nonzero asymmetry [447] off a proton target. This result is shown in Fig. 19. The measurement was repeated by COMPASS using both a deuteron and a proton target. The result off the proton target is consistent with the HERMES result, but much more precise [448]. At the higher \u221a s of the COMPASS experiment the hadron multiplicities are also higher, which contributes quadratically to the precision of the measurement of hadron pairs. Similar to the Collins effect, asymmetries grow with the fractional energy z the pair is carrying. The asymmetries are enhanced around M h = M \u03c1 and fall again for M h > M \u03c1 . This is at variance with the results seen in e + e \u2212 , which might be due to the different spectrum of partial waves contributing to the pion pair production. COMPASS also studied the interplay between the di-hadron asymmetries and single hadron asymmetries [449].",

            "text": "Spin-dependent di-hadron FF H 1 in pp: The polarization-dependent DiFF H 1 survives an integration over the intrinsic transverse momentum of the hadron pair with respect to the fragmenting quark axis. Since the relative transverse momentum to the quark axis therefore does not have to be reconstructed, different compared to measurements sensitive to H \u22a5 1 discussed earlier, the measurement of this effect does not require the jet reconstruction in p \u2191 p scattering. Instead, the second hadron provides another degree of freedom that allows to form two independent vectors, the difference R and the sum P h of the two hadron momenta. This actually significantly simplifies the di-hadron measurement compared to the single-hadron measurement of the Collins TMD. Because the jet axis does not have to be reconstructed, the systematic effects are significantly reduced. The observable in Eq. (131) is the spin-dependent part of the di-hadron cross section that also depends on the azimuthal angle of R around P h . The corresponding transverse SSA observable has been measured for \u03c0 + /\u03c0 \u2212 pairs at the STAR experiment, where significant asymmetries have been observed both at \u221a s = 200 GeV and \u221a s = 500 GeV [450,421,451]. These results are also shown in Fig. 20. The asymmetries generally rise with M h and p T . Here the p T is the transverse momentum of the hadron pair with respect to the beam axis, which should not be confused with the intrinsic | P hT | relative to the fragmenting quark acquired during the fragmentation process. Therefore higher p T are correlated with higher z and higher values of x, the momentum fraction of the active parton in the parent nucleon. The M h dependence is very similar to the dependence observed in SIDIS which is expected since the underlying partonic processes are also similar. Earlier, PHENIX showed an analysis of the correlations of charged unidentified hadrons, and the correlation between \u03c0 0 's and charged hadrons [452]. However, no signal was observed in the covered kinematic region. As discussed in Sec. 4.5.5, there is only very little data available for the spin-averaged FF D",

Most fits use a power law parameterization of the form z \u03b1 (1 \u2212 z) \u03b2 , which can be seen as inspired by the Feynman-Field model [467] or motivated by approaches to fit PDFs. The Drell-Levy Yan-relation [166,167,168] as well as modified Gribov-Lipatov [163,468,469,470] are used to justify using similar approaches for PDFs and FFs. A notable exception from the power law description is the statistical approach by Bourrely and Soffer [461] which, considering the Gribov-Lipatov relation between PDFs and FF, applies a similar statistical approach that was already applied by the same authors to PDFs. There is not yet an approach based on neural networks similar to the NNPDF extraction [471] for PDFs. Therefore the uncertainty of all modern fits discussed in this section exhibit some bias due to the functional form used which provides constraints in unmeasured regions. Depending on the discriminating power of the experimental data used in the fit more constraints are imposed on SU (3) flavor symmetry and/or relations between FFs of different flavors are fixed.",

Among the pioneering first NLO fits to FFs of identified light mesons were BKK [455], KKP [460], AKK [472] and Kretzer [223]. Each of those used e + e \u2212 data only and do not have a rigorous determination of the uncertainties of the FFs beyond the statistical uncertainties of parameters as they come out of the fit or differences between different extraction methods. BFGW [459] use some pp data in addition to e + e \u2212 data. However, they only extract FFs for unidentified hadrons and no updated results with later data is available. In order to have access to flavor information and the gluon FF, some of the fits (KKP, AKK) use the tagged LEP data described in the previous Sec. 4.5. Similarly, the later HKNS and DSS fits discussed below take advantage of the flavor separated LEP and SLD data. As discussed earlier, it is not clear how to treat this tagged data at NLO in a consistent way. Later in Ref. [458] SIDIS data were included which allowed to extract flavor separated FFs. The first extraction of D 1 for light hadrons that provides a rigorous evaluation of the uncertainties of the extracted functions was performed by Hirai, Kumano, Nagai, and Sudoh (HKNS) [398]. The results for D \u03c0/q 1 at the Z-mass scale are shown in Fig. 21. This extraction only uses e + e \u2212 data available at the  Fig. 21 shows, the extracted FFs are quite precise with the exception of the gluon FF. This FF can be determined better by including pp data. The first simultaneous fit of pp data together with e + e \u2212 and SIDIS data was performed by de Florian, Sassot, and Stratmann (DSS) in Refs. [131,476].",

The latest fit of the pion FFs [132] also includes LHC data from the ALICE experiment, taken at cm energies up to 7 TeV, as well as the new precision SIA data from Belle and BaBar. The extraction of the FFs as well as the fit to the e + e \u2212 data is shown in Fig. 22. Compared to HKNS, the precision of all FFs is improved. In particular the gluon FF, which was only very poorly constrained in the HKNS fit, is now determined to a similar precision as the light quark FFs. This is due to the pp data which is available from RHIC for 200 GeV and from the LHC up to 7 TeV, as well as to the precision SIA data which is now also available over a wide energy range and therefore constrains the gluon FF contributing to the evolution of the quark FFs. It should also be noted that the functional form of the DSS approach is more flexible than the previous fits, since the data provides more constraints. In particular, fewer constraints based on flavor symmetry are imposed. Another difference to HKNS is the use of Lagrange multipliers. However, as mentioned above, the consistency with and applicability of the Hessian method was shown which was used for the latest DSS extractions.",

This is in particular true for the gluon FF, for which the NLO analysis of the pp has to be under control. Before LHC, the most stringent contraints came from RHIC data. However, the resulting FFs did a poor job describing LHC data [477]. The new DSS fit solves this problem with a refit using the LHC data and removing the PHENIX low p T points, which cause the most tension, via a minimum p T cut. This illustrates that the FFs extracted from a global fit are only reliable in the kinematic region and for the processes that were used to fit the FFs. Of course, observables where FFs couple to PDFs are particularly challenging. One example for the interdependence of PDF and FF extraction is the so-called strangeness 'puzzle', the fact that the nucleon's strangeness extracted from SIDIS data can be different from the one extracted from inclusive measurements, a discrepancy that might be traced back to the FFs used [478].",

Recently [466] a first NNLO calculation was performed to extract charged pion FFs using the DSS framework. Only data from e + e \u2212 annihilation was used since there are no calculations for the underlying hard process in SIDIS and pp at NNLO available yet. As expected, the K-factors, which give the ratio between the present calculation and the one performed at NLO, go down. Away from the thresholds at low and high z, they are below 10% down from about 40% for NLO/LO, giving an estimate of the contribution beyond NNLO. The fit is also able to better describe BaBar data on pion production at low z. (Belle has a z cut of 0.2, whereas BaBar goes below z of 0.1.) This is expected because at low z higher order terms dominate, making resummation techniques necessary. We come back to this point below. Most importantly though, the dominating theoretical error from the scale dependence of the extraction goes down from about 10% to about 5% at Belle and BaBar energies. This is significant, since this is now close to the experimental uncertainties. At higher cm energies the theoretical uncertainty is even smaller, reaching 1-2% at LEP energies.",

At phase space boundaries, e.g. high z and, in pp collisions, at high x T , the importance of higher order terms leads to significant uncertainties in fixed order calculations. Resummation techniques can be used to address some of these problems. Of the fits discussed earlier, the AKK update, AKK08 [462] already contains resummation at high z and also includes target mass effects for the FFs of heavier particles (See also the work in [40]). More recently [479] showed the impact of large z resummation and target mass corrections at low z in the description of the precision data from Belle and BaBar. In comparison, fixed order fits, e.g. DSS, also achieve good fits at high z, where resummation would be needed, which is probably because those higher order corrections are fitted as well. A special role is played by the low z region, roughly for z < 0.1. In this region the time-like splitting functions have singularities [480] that dominate at z values that are orders of magnitude higher than the x at which these singularities become important for the corresponding space-like splitting functions of PDFs. The modified leading-log technique described in Sec. 7.3 can be used to fit this region and conversely the data at low z can be used to test predictions obtained from resummation.",

As discussed in Sec. 6.1, model calculations do not support such a separation, yet the ansatz in (137) may be a good approximation to model results. Moreover, one can describe reasonably well many existing data using the simple Gaussian ansatz in (137) -see for instance Ref. [483]. The Gaussian widths p 2 T , P 2 hT are then fitted to data. In Eq. (137) we also show the dependence of the TMDs on the renormalization scale \u00b5 which, in this simplified framework, is given by the (DGLAP) evolution of the integrated partonic functions. More sophisticated frameworks include Gaussian widths that depend on the flavor and/or on z (x) for TMD FFs (TMD PDFs). Ideally the full machinery of pQCD should be used including higher order corrections in the hard scattering and, in particular, proper TMD evolution. Below we will summarize what is known about such approaches in the context of D h/q 1 (z, P 2 hT ). Early work on the transverse momentum dependence of D h/q 1 can be found in Ref. [481].

However, for a couple of reasons the analysis in [481] could be doubted. First, it did not take into account all the contributions to F cos \u03c6 h U U that one finds in TMD factorization [63,65]. Second, the status of TMD factorization at twist-3 is presently unclear [88,89]. In fact, in Ref. [89] it was precisely the Cahn effect for which a problem was made explicit. On the other hand, contributions that are neglected in (138) might be small. An indication that this could indeed be the case came from Ref. [482], where HERMES data on average transverse momenta of produced hadrons [489] were fitted. That work reported the values p 2 T = 0.33 GeV 2 , P 2 hT = 0.16 GeV 2 [482], which are relatively close to the results from [481]. Based on later results from the HERMES Collaboration on the transverse momentum dependence of the SIDIS cross section [490] the following widths were found in Ref. [483], ",

[481,482,483] a quite consistent phenomenology seemed to emerge including the twist-3 Cahn effect. However, a recent analysis of new data from HERMES [493] and COMPASS [494] on the Cahn effect gave rise to quite different values for the Gaussian widths [248]. In particular, very small values ( p 2 T = (0.03 -0.04) GeV 2 ) were obtained for the width of the TMD PDF f q/p 1 [248]. This result indicates that the phenomenology of the Cahn effect is actually not under control and suggests that other non-perturbative twist-3 effects may matter for the numerics. Additionally, higher order pQCD corrections might play a role as they also can generate an azimuthal dependence of the SIDIS cross section [495,496].",

These data were analyzed in Refs. [484,189] using essentially the framework described above. A new element in Ref. [484] though were flavor-dependent widhts. It was argued that the fit suggests a somewhat larger width for disfavored FFs of pions than for favored FFs. This outcome could be compared to studies of the flavor-dependence of the widths for TMD PDFs. In that regard a recent work, based on the chiral quark solition model, found the interesting result that TMD PDFs for sea quarks are considerably broader than distributions of valence quarks [497]. Also the authors of [189] saw an indication of flavor-dependent widths for TMD FFs, but with less significance. Additionally, widths that depend on the longitudinal momentum fractions x, z were explored in [484], and an improvement of the fits was reported. (Related older work on TMD FFs with z-dependent widths can be found in Refs. [498,499]. These studies mostly focus on single-inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions.) In contrast, according to [189] it is difficult to constrain the additional parameters of such a scenario. In Fig. 23 we show some fit results of Ref. [189] for multiplicities from HERMES [322]. The following ranges for the Gaussian widths are given in [189], ",

It was found that the COMPASS data (at different Q 2 ) prefer such a scenario over constant widths, while the HERMES data do not. This outcome is in qualitative agreement with the expectation based on TMD evolution that transverse momentum distributions broaden when going to higher energies and scales -see also Sec. 2.7.2.

[185], is shown in Fig. 6. As already mentioned in Sec. 2.7.2, currently there is a lot of discussion about the phenomenology of TMD evolution, which is largely related to the non-perturbative input to the evolution. One challenge in that regard is the simultaneous description of SIDIS data taken at relatively low scales by HERMES and COMPASS, and data for gauge boson production in hadronic collisions -see [46] and references therein. In Ref. [194] a detailled discussion is given on how new data for e + e \u2212 \u2192 h a h b X might help to put further constraints on TMD evolution.

            "text": "The Collins function H \u22a5 1 is a spin dependent, chiral odd TMD. In SIDIS (and pp) it couples to the similarly poorly known transversity distribution h 1 . Fits that do not include e + e \u2212 data therefore have to simultaneously extract h 1 and H \u22a5 1 . Since H \u22a5 1 describes the spin dependence of the intrinsic transverse momentum in the fragmentation process, the transverse momentum dependence of the FF and the PDF has to be modeled as well. Furthermore, the experimental input consists of SSAs measured at SIDIS experiments and ratios measured in e + e \u2212 annihilation, as described in Sec. 4.5, which contain a nontrivial mix of spin-dependent and spin-averaged PDFs and FFs that both carry transverse-momentum dependence. First extractions of H \u22a5 1 have been performed using SIDIS data [138] and, when the Belle data became available, using information from SIDIS and e + e \u2212 at the same time [502]. The first simultaneous extraction of H \u22a5 1 and h 1 from a global fit to SIDIS data from HERMES and e + e \u2212 data from Belle has been performed by [503]. This fit has then been subsequently improved as new data became available from COMPASS and BaBar [504,501,500,505]. The most recent iterations include the | P h\u22a5 | dependence and the kaon asymmetries measured by BaBar. The fit factorizes the collinear part of FF and PDF and the transverse momentum dependent part. Due to the lack of data, only favored and  disfavored FFs for (u,d) and s quarks are considered. There is also too little data to extract the transverse momentum dependence, instead a gaussian shape is assumed with a width that is fixed for all Q 2 . The width is taken to be equal to the widths of unpolarized PDFs and FFs which are determined as described in Sec. 5.1 above. The collinear part of the FF is parametrized in terms of the unpolarized FF with two free parameters. The kaon FF has only one free parameter and is chosen to be proportional to D \u03c0/q 1 and only the favored part of the Collins FF for kaons is constrained in a meaningful way. Only the collinear part is evolved using regular DGLAP. Even though this approach is rather simple, it achieves a very good description of the available data within their uncertainties. Given that the multiplicity data in a similar kinematic regime can be fitted well with the same approach, this might be expected. Fig. 24 shows the fit to the BaBar pion data on the left side compared to the extraction of [185] on the right side. The later uses TMD evolution in the CSS framework -see also Sec. 2.7.2. Fig. 25 shows the resulting extractions of H \u22a5 1 vs z. Even though the Gaussian approach in [505] is much simpler, the description of the z as well as the | P h\u22a5 | dependence of the data is equally good. Even the prediction for the asymmetries measured at BESIII, which are not part of the fit are in reasonable agreement with the data. Since H \u22a5 1 is a TMD, it is expected that the simple model for the | P hT | dependence as well as the restriction of the evolution to the collinear part fails for sufficiently precise data or predictions at sufficiently different scales. To address this issue, Ref. [185] uses TMD evolution. Here, in addition to the collinear part, which is parametrized in a similar way as in the Gaussian approach of [505], another non-perturbative function is needed, the so-called soft part of the evolution kernel. However, this soft part is universal and a parametrization from literature is choosen, i.e., it does not have to fitted to the data. (We also refer to Sec. 5.2 for a brief discussion of present phenomenological problems related to TMD evolution.) Instead of | P hT |, the relevant parametrizations are done in b T space and are not trivial. However, the resulting | P hT | shape, at least at low to moderate scales, is similar to the Gaussian shape chosen by [505]. This is shown in Fig. 25 for the z dependence and in Fig. 24 for the | P h\u22a5 | dependence of the e + e \u2212 data which we referred to earlier. As already remarked above, the fit to the data and the size of the error bars are comparable to the non-TMD evolved fit shown in the left panels. ",

The general structure of this observable in collinear twist-3 factorization is discussed above in Sec. 3.4. According to Eq. (124) it has three main contributions. The first term in (124) was studied in a number of papers [258,259,260,261,262,506,507]. It contains quark-gluon-quark correlations and tri-gluon correlations in the polarized proton, where for the former one distinguishes between so-called soft-gluon pole and soft-fermion pole contributions. The second term in (124), which arises from twist-3 effects in the unpolarized proton, was shown to be small [508,509]. A complete analytical result for the third term in (124), that is, the twist-3 fragmentation contribution, was obtained in [96]. For some time it was generally believed that the soft-gluon pole contribution, which is associated with the transversely polarized proton and given by the twist-3 Qiu-Sterman function T F [115,116], dominates A N in hadronic collisions. The situation changed when people made use of a relation between T F and the Sivers TMD PDF [80]. The Sivers function enters the SIDIS cross section and had been fitted to available data. But an attempt failed to simultaneously explain A N and the Sivers asymmetry in SIDIS [506]. The T F extracted from the two reactions had opposite signs [506], which is now known as \"sign-mismatch\" problem. Other scenarios discussed in the literature either could not solve the problem [510] or are unlikely to do so [261,507].",

Also data on the transverse SSA in fully inclusive DIS [511,512] seem to support this point of view [513]. Therefore, in Ref. [98] the potential role of the twist-3 fragmentation part of (124) was studied. According to  Figure 26: Fit to data on A N from RHIC for neutral pion production (left panel) from STAR [429,432,334] and charged pion production (right panel) from BRAHMS [430]. The fit corresponds to \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 1.03 [98].  [98]. The third twist-3 FF H h/q is then fixed through the relation (56). The aforementioned soft-gluon pole contribution to A N was also included in the numerical calculation and fixed through the Sivers function given in Refs. [514,266] which was extracted from data on the Sivers asymmetry in SIDIS. In this framework a good fit was obtained (see Fig. 26), where the analysis also showed that the data cannot be described at all if the three-parton FF\u0124 h/q F U is switched off [98]. As pointed out in [98], the twist-3 approach can also explain the rather flat behaviour of A N as function of | P h\u22a5 | observed at RHIC [434], which was generally considered a big challenge. The twist-3 fragmentation contribution was found to be the dominant contribution to A N . In this context one has to keep in mind that the soft-gluon pole term comes with an opposite sign compared to the data due to the signmismatch problem. The fitted function\u0124 h/q F U of Ref. [98] shares similarities with a spectator model calculation [515]. In general, the work [98] suggested that one can simultaneously describe A N in pp scattering using collinear twist-3 factorization, the Sivers asymmetry in SIDIS, the Collins asymmetry in SIDIS, and the azimuthal cos(2\u03c6) asymmetry in e + e \u2212 \u2192 h a h b X. In particular, twist-3 fragmentation effects may play an important role when trying to answer the longstanding question about the origin of the observed large transverse SSAs in hadronic collisions.",

Agreement in sign was found, but the calculation typically overshoots the data. A number of potential reasons for the discrepancy were discussed in [98]. Most importantly NLO corrections may be very large for A N in lepton-nucleon scattering for the kinematics of the HERMES and Jefferson-Lab experiments. For the twist-2 unpolarized cross section of N \u2192 hX the NLO contributions are indeed very significant [517]. It would be important to also push the calculation of A N for this process to the NLO level. Another key point for the phenomenology may be that Ref. [98] did not use the constraint among the three tiwst-3 FFs which follows from the LIR relations [32] see Eqs. (57), (58)    ",

Both, unpolarized and polarized part of H 1 have been modeled by the product of a z dependent part, a part depending on the invariant mass of the pion pair, and a part with mixed dependence. The functional form of the z dependent part has been chosen similar to the functional form used for the Collins single hadron fragmentation function and for the M \u03c0\u03c0 dependent part a Breit-Wigner function has been chosen. A purely M \u03c0\u03c0 \u2212z factorized form does not lead to a good fit, so a polynomial mixing M \u03c0\u03c0 and z has been added. In particular the dependence on the mass of the hadron pair is inspired by model calculations where H 1 receives contributions from the \u03c0\u03c0 continuum as well as resonant channels, where pion pairs in relative partial waves with different quantum numbers than the continuum are produced. In the kinematic region M \u03c0\u03c0 < 1GeV , these are mainly pions coming from \u03c1, \u03c9 and K 0 S decays and each of these channels are added to the functional form.

Therefore one has to resort to models. Roughly speaking two general classes of models q(k) h(P h , S h ) Figure 28: Representation of the fragmentation correlator \u2206 h/q in Eq.

One of them is comprised of spectator models in which the parton, in a single step, fragments into a hadron plus a spectator. The second class comprises models that describe multiple hadron emission, where a number of different versions exist in the literature. Some recent works aim at combining the two frameworks. It is impossible to give here a full account of all the existing approaches, and we will mostly focus on the spectator models which recently have been used frequently to calculate (spin-dependent) TMD FFs as well as DiFFs. In general, at present it is still difficult to make robust predictions for FFs. Typically one has to fit a number of model parameters to existing data.",

Integrating the expression in (145) upon k T provides D fav 1 (z). Since for large transverse momenta D fav 1 (z, z 2 k 2 T ) in (145) behaves like 1/ k 2 T -the same large k T behaviour that one finds in perturbative QCD -this integral is UV-divergent. One way of getting a finite result is through introducing a cutoff on the virtuality of the fragmenting quark [520] which, due to Eq. (143), also implies a cutoff for k T . The numerical result shares qualitative features with the phenomenology of D fav 1 (z) in that it decreases with increasing z, but one cannot expect such a simple model to give quantitative agreement. In order to improve the phenomenology also the pseudo-vector quark-pion couping, as utilized in the chiralinvariant Georgi-Manohar model [521], was explored [520]. This approach should be more realistic because the pion decouples from the quark in the limit of a vanishing momentum as expected for a Goldstone boson. In fact one gets a quite good description of the z behavior of D fav 1 (z), but the magnitude is just about half of typical fit results [520], unless one uses a value for the axial quark-pion coupling that differs from the original Georgi-Manohar work [521]. Other similar models were used as well. In the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [522,523] integrated FFs for pions were obtained in Ref. [524] and for kaons in [525]. In the same approach, the effect of vector mesons on pion and kaon FFs, and fragmentation into baryons were studied in Ref [526]. Moreover, in Refs. [527,528,529] pion and kaon FFs were derived in a lonlocal chiral quark model [530]. We refer to the original papers for a detailled discussion of the numerical results. Overall one again just finds qualitative agreement with existing fits. Such models typically provide (much) better results for PDFs than for FFs which supports the aforementiond statement that modelling parton FFs is a difficult task. We also point out that in all these model results for FFs the z-dependence and the k T -dependence do not decouple, and the k T -dependence is not Gaussian. Both assumptions were frequently used in existing extractions of TMD FFs. On the other hand, for small k T the transverse momentum dependence obtained in such spectator models can be approximated by Gausssian forms. (In this context we also refer to [531].) Also, existing data do not permit to unambiguously rule out these assumptions. We note in passing that Refs. [524,135,12] contain discussion on checks of sum rules for FFs in spectator models.",

First, the mass of the spectator particle is allowed to vary. Second, the quark-hadron-spectator vertex is decorated by a form factor which depends, in different ways, on the kinematics of the fragmentation process. Needless to say that such approaches are not related to an underlying Lagrange density. Studies along these lines can be found, for instance, in Refs. [533,519,534,535,536,532]. Here we only briefly discuss results for D h/q 1 from the model of Ref. [532], where pion and kaon FFs were considered. The model has a total of five free parameters that were fitted to the FFs from [223]. The curves in Fig. 29 give an indication of the Spectator models were also used to estimate the Collins function. A first such calculation was already presented in the original paper by Collins [27]. In that work a nonzero H \u22a5 1 was obtained by taking into account the imaginary part of the propagator of the time-like fragmenting quark. Despite this result doubts remained in the community as to whether the Collins function would actually be nonzero or if a cancellation between different imaginary parts may occur in nature -see for instance Ref. [122]. Given that situation, in Ref. [76] the Lagrange density in (144) was used for a full field-theoretic model calculation to lowest non-trivial order in the pseudo-scalar coupling g \u03c0q . Based on the diagrams in Fig. 30 one finds the result [76] ",

The final result for the Collins function in (146) is nonzero, which gave support to its existence from the theoretical point of view [76]. In the meantime there is of course multiple compelling experimental evidence for a non-vanishing Collins function as discussed in more detail in Sec. 4  . Later on also gluon loops were taken into account in different spectator models [537,538,532,539]. In such approaches even a robust prediction of the sign of the Collins function is nontrivial since individual diagrams can contribute with opposite signs [538]. The latest phenomenological papers [532,539] used gluon loops only. The Collins function for pions and kaons was computed in Ref. [532] after the parameters of the model were fitted to D h/q 1 as discussed in the previous paragraph. Disfavored Collins functions were not computed in the spectator model but rather fixed through the Sch\u00e4fer-Teryaev sum rule in (90)  [136,135], combined with a couple of simplifying assumptions [532]. In the case of pions reasonable agreement with parameterizations was obtained, while at that time the paper was written no experimental information was available on the Collins function for kaons [532].",

In a recent work the T-odd functions H h/q in (21)  were computed in the linear sigma model, which was the first estimate ever for the IFF. In that model the necessary imaginary part comes from the decay width of the sigma meson. Another approach was used in [122] with the aim of getting a more realistic phenomenology of H 1 . In particular, it was argued that quark fragmentation into two pions could be described as 2-step process: the quark first fragments into a rho meson, which then decays into two pions. Based on this picture and on data for \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts the DiFFs were estimated. A remarkable prediction of that study was a sign change of H",

[133] another spectator model calculation of DiFFs for pion production was presented. The parameters of the model were fixed by fitting D \u03c0\u03c0/q 1 to the output of the PYTHIA event generator for two-pion production in deep inelastic scattering for HERMES kinematics. Like PYTHIA, the model contains non-resonant pion production, and fragmentation into several heavier mesons plus their decays into pions. After having fixed the parameters, the IFF H \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 /q 1 was computed, where again no sign changed was found [133]. The unpolarized DiFF D h 1 h 2 /q 1 was also calculated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model by considering the three lightest quarks, and the \u03c0\u03c0, \u03c0K and KK final states [543]. Based on the results of Ref. [543] the evolution of DiFFs was studied in detail in [544]. Later on the model calculations of [543] were extended by including the production of vector mesons [545]. Through their decay, vector mesons influence to DiFFs of pseudo-scalar mesons, where numerically significant contributions were obtained. This observation is in line with the output from the PYTHIA event generator and the general philosophy of [133]. An independent study of the unpolarized DiFF D h 1 h 2 /q 1 in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model was reported in [546]. The results do not agree with the earlier calculation in Ref. [543]. In the same work also a nonlocal chiral quark model was used. The numerical results from these two models were found to differ significantly [546]. We also mention that very recently the unpolarized gluon FF D h/g 1 was studied in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [547].",

The general principle of that approach is sketched in Fig. 31: a high-energetic quark is combined with an antiquark from a qq pair created out of the vacuum. This combination process repeats until the leftover energy falls below some cut-off. A key underlying idea of the Feynman-Field model is that one can describe multiple hadron emission originating from a single parton by just one function f (\u03b7) characterizing a single emission. Here f (\u03b7) describes the probability that the first hierarchy (rank 1) meson leaves fractional momentum \u03b7 to the remaining cascade. The function is normalized so that [467] 1 0 d\u03b7 f (\u03b7) = 1 .",

            "text": "The parameter d then has to be fitted to data. For simplicity we have not shown any flavor-dependence which was of course incorporated in such a model [467,548]. With a very limited set of parameters people were quite successful in describing data from early e + e \u2212 annihilation experiments [549,550]. Even though nowadays when fitting FFs to data one uses full QCD dynamics entering through higher order Wilson coefficients and evolution equations, the Feynman-Field model still gives some guidance for the parameterizations of FFs at a given initial scale. An approach similar to the Feynman-Field model is the string fragmentation model [551,56,552,58], where hadrons are also formed in a hierarchy as indicated in Fig. 31. However, the kinematics used in the two models is different. Also, in the string model, applied to e + e \u2212 annihilation for instance, one does not consider independent fragmentation of the outgoing quark and antiquark as done in the Feynman-Field model, but rather hadronization of the qq pair. The quark and antiquark loose energy to the color field between them, which is supposed to collapse into a stringlike configuration. The string has a uniform energy per unit length. If that energy gets too high the string breaks up into hadrons. Related to the string model are so-called cluster models [553,554]. The underlying idea of such models is that in a full event in a first step color-neutral clusters of partoncs form which then hadronize. A longer discussion of the key features and differences of these three types of models can be found, e.g., in Ref. [555], along with more references to the original literature. Such approaches for multiple hadron emission are a key ingredient in Monte-Carlo event generators that describe the complete final state of an event, where the more mordern generators incorporate mostly a string model or a cluster model. The string fragmentation approach was used in Ref. [556] in order to model the Collins function. To explain the general idea we consider fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a spin-0 particle like a pion. In the string model one assumes that a qq pair generated through string breaking carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum, that is, J P = 0 + [556]. This can be achieved if the pair has spin S = 1 and orbital angular momentum L = 1, with spin and orbital angular momentum pointing in opposite directions. In other words, there is a correlation between the spin of the antiquark from the qq pair and its orbital angular momentum. Since the antiquark and the original quark form a spin-0 meson there is also a correlation between the orbital angular momentum of the antiquark, which is transferred to the meson, and the transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark. This implies a nonzero Collins function, namely that the meson is produced in a preferred direction relative to the plane given by the momentum of the initial quark and its transverse spin. The model was orginally applied to the transverse SSA in processes like p \u2191 p \u2192 hX and provided the correct sign compared to the data [556]. The sign also agrees with the Collins function extracted from SIDIS data. A disfavored FF is generated from rank 2 (and higher rank) mesons, and one readily finds that the model predicts opposite signs for the favored and disfavored Collins functions [556], in agreement with phenomenology. Moreover, the model leads to the following interesting relation between the Collins function for a pion and for a rho meson [557],",

[556] is a semi-classical description, which can hardly be compared with (field-theoretic) spectator model calculations based on interference between different amplitudes and the need for an imaginary part in the production amplitude -see the discussion above in Sec. 6.1. Also, since individual contributions in field-theoretic models can give rise to different signs for the Collins function, it is not clear how robust a semi-classical argument about the sign of the Collins functions can be. In this context we also refer to [558] which apparently contains interesting further developments of the string fragmentation model including (transverse) spin effects.",

More precisely, a single emission of a hadron is computed in a field-theoretic approach, and the result is then iterated in the spirit of the Feynman-Field approach. Calculations along these lines were performed for D h/q 1 (z) in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [524,525,526] and in a non-local chiral-quark model [527,528,529]. Dedicated studies of TMD FFs can be found in [559,539,560], including a discussion on how model-independent constraints such as the Sch\u00e4fer-Teryaev sum rule [136,135] can be satisfied in such a picture. Related calculations on DiFFs can be found in [544,545,561,546]. The general aim of such studies is to get a quantitative description of FFs which contains as few parameters as possible by computing single-hadron emission based on a Lagrange density. At present it is not clear if this aim can be reached or if ultimately one needs to work with more flexible parameterizations describing single-hadron production, which of course would increase the number of free parameters.",

At present, for most of these FFs we do not have any information from experiment. In the majority of cases where experimental data exist, it is for fragmentation into \u039b and/or\u039b hyperons which are self-analyzing, that is, they reveal their polarization through the angular depedence of the decay products. The analysis of such experiments is not easy though, since a large fraction of the produced \u039b particles comes from the decay of heavier hyperons rather than direct production.",

The relevant observable is a longitudinal SSA which is allowed for this process due to the parity-violating weak interaction (see also the related discussion in Sec. 3.4). Using a NLO framework and making some simplifying assumptions about the flavor structure of G \u039b/q 1 (z), in Ref. [226] first information on G \u039b/q 1 for favored fragmentation was obtained on the basis of data from LEP. This FF is essentially unknown in the case of disfavored and gluon fragmentation. In the 1990s people started hoping that the production of longitudinally polarized \u039b's could also shed light on the spin crisis of the nucleon. In this context, one question was about the contribution of strange quarks to the nucleon spin. Since several models predicted that the polarization of the \u039b is largely associated with a polarized strange quark, one expected in the SIDIS process p \u2192 \u039bX, in which G \u039b/q 1 (z) enters [563,564], a strong sensitivity to the strange quark helicity distribution in the proton. The FF G \u039b/q 1 (z) also shows up in p \u2192 \u039bX, a process which was measured by the E665 Collaboration [565], the HERMES Collaboration [566,567], and the COMPASS Collaboration [568]. However, so far there is no data available for p \u2192 \u039bX. A future electron-ion collider [280,281] would be ideal for such a measurement and allow one to get back to the strange quark polarization in the nucleon and the production of polarized hyperons. The functions G \u039b/i 1 (z) for both quarks and gluons also appear in the QCD description of pp \u2192 \u039bX [569]. A measurement of this double-spin observable was performed by the STAR Collaboration [570] where the result for \u039b's is compatible with zero, while a small nonzero effect was observed for\u039b's.",

This FF describes the fragmentation of an unpolarized quark into a transversely polarized hadron or, in other words, a transverse single-spin effect. Using the generalized parton model, in Ref. [573] a fit of this function was made based on data for the transverse SSA in processes like pp \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X. In the next paragraph we return to such SSAs. The result of the fit was then used to estimate transverse SSAs in SIDIS [574], including neutrino-nucleon scattering \u03bdN \u2192 \u00b1 \u039b \u2191 X for which some data are available from the NOMAD Collaboration [575]. In Ref. [576] it was discussed how through observables involving D \u22a5 \u039b/q 1T one can experimentally check the universality of TMD FFs [145,83]. A number of SIDIS observables related to (moments of) TMD FFs can be found in [143]. In the case of e + e \u2212 \u2192 h a h b X a complete list of tree-level results for polarized hadrons is available for both photon and Z 0 boson exchange [73,577,578,579,77]. Systematic studies of such observables could bring our understanding of hyperon polarization and the fragmentation process in general to the next level.",

            "text": "We now proceed to observables which are sensitive to (integrated) twist-3 FFs for polarized hadrons as defined in Eqs. (17)- (22) and (52)- (54). The one measured first was the transverse SSA in processes like pp \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X, which in collinear twist-3 factorization involve twist-3 FFs. For some time it has been observed that hyperons produced in unpolarized hadronic collisions exhibit sizable asymmetries towards large x F values [580,581,582,583,584,585,586,587,588], similar to the transverse SSAs discussed in Sec. 4.5.4. Some of the earlier data are reviewed in [589,590]. At the LHC, the most recent measurement was performed by the ATLAS experiment [591], which did not observe an asymmetry consistent with the small x F of the measurement. Note that at x F = 0 this effect should vanish. If the transverse momentum of the hyperon is large enough the most rigorous framework to calculate this asymmetry is collinear twist-3 factorization (see also the discussion in Sec. 3.4). The general structure of the spindependent cross section is identical with Eq. (124). The available calculations address the twist-3 effect associated with the incoming (unpolarized) hadrons [592,593,594]. It is important to also calculate the twist-3 fragmentation contribution in order to have a complete result in collinear twist-3 factorization. The same final state asymmetry was also measured in photo-production \u03b3N \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X [595,596] and quasi-real photo-production in N \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X [597,598]. The complete analytical result for the case of lepto-production was provided in Ref. [599], while a numerical estimate is still missing. The final expression contains contributions from the twist-3 FFs D \u22a5(1) \u039b/q 1T (where we use the moment definition in (44)), D \u039b/q T in (19), as well as the three-parton FFsD \u039b/q, F T in (52) and\u011c \u039b/q, F T in (53). Using the relations presented in [32] the entire final result can be expressed through the three-parton FFs only. In principle the simplest (twist-3) transverse SSA for polarized hyperons can be measured through e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X [600]. It is worth noting that according to Ref. [73] its analytical result at LO is very compact as it just contains the twist-3 FF D \u039b/q T . A measurement by OPAL at LEP energies [601] did not show a significant signal [601], which could well be due to the high \u221a s. It would be very interesting to search for this fundamental asymmetry in lower-energy data from the B-factories.",

Three parameterizations of photon FFs are available in the literature that are based on a NLO framework for photon production in e + e \u2212 annihilation [602,603]. No error estimates were given in these papers. While data from lepton-nucleon scattering and from pp collisions could further constrain photon FFs [604,605,606], at present no global analysis is available.

(94) have singularities that dominate at z values that are orders of magnitude higher than the x values at which these singularities become important for the corresponding space-like splitting functions of PDFs [480]. Therefore, instead of a fixed-order treatment, for low z often the so-called modified leading-log approximation (MLLA) is used [608] -for reviews of this method see for instance Ref. [609,610,40]. The MLLA framework allows for important tests of our understanding of pQCD. However, it is not the focus of the extractions of FFs discussed in this review. Therefore we here only give a very brief account of this approach and refer to the literature for more details -see for instance Ref. [609,610,40].",

However, depending on the kinematics, they may also emerge from the target fragmentation region, in particular if the cm energy of the collision and the fragmentation variable z are not very high. For such a situation another class of non-perturbative objects was introduced and called fracture functions [227]. They can be considered as a hybrid object sharing similarities with both PDFs and FFs. The dependence of fracture functions on spin degrees of freedom and on transverse momenta was discussed in Ref. [228]. Afterwards the study in [228] was extended to the production of two hadrons, one in the current fragmentation region and one in the target fragmentation region which, in principle, would allow one to measure also chiral-odd fracture functions [619]. Looking at two hadrons in these regions can also give rise to new observables [620]. Related recent work on fracture functions and the target fragmentation region can be found for instance in [621,622,623].",

Using only the leading quadratic term, the confidence interval is chosen using a \u2206\u03c7 2 corresponding to the 68% confidence interval in the given N-dimensional space under the assumption that the \u03c7 2 method behaves analogously to a normal distribution. The advantage of this method is, that it is computationally less intensive compared to the Lagrange multiplier method and eigenvectors corresponding to the shape of the \u03c7 2 function can be used to easily estimate uncertainties of arbitrary observables. On the other hand, the assumptions regarding the shape of the \u03c7 2 function have to be validated. The Lagrange multiplier method does not use those assumptions but is computationally harder and it is more difficult to estimate the uncertainties on arbitrary observables. A detailed comparison between the two methods and its applicability for the extraction of D 1 can be found in Ref. [475]. In addition to the light quark FFs for pions, kaons and protons, HKNS also extract charm and bottom FFs. The tagged data from SLD and DELPHI allow a quite precise determination of these FFs. In the light quark sector, the restriction to e + e \u2212 data means that HKNS effectively",
