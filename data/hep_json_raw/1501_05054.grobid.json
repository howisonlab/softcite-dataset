Systematic effects from flux normalization and modeling, modeling of cross sections and nuclear interactions, and far detector effects were addressed. Experts presented the capabilities of existing and planned tools. A program of study to determine estimates of and requirements for the size of these effects was designed.

Until recently, the expected level of systematic uncertainty for a long-baseline experiment at Fermilab's Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) has been estimated based on experience with existing experiments and estimates of the performance of the next-generation detectors being designed for experiments at LBNF. These systematic uncertainties are approximated in sensitivity calculations by normalization uncertainties that cover the uncertainties in all of the models used in the MC generation chain. These include the flux model, neutrino interaction cross section models, nuclear models, and models of the near and far detector response.",

The ultimate goal of this program is to perform detailed studies of each source of systematic uncertainty that will determine detector design and analysis performance requirements to constrain systematic uncertainty to the projected levels. In this document, the tools that have been developed to study systematic uncertainty in LBNE are described in Section 3, the status of existing studies is described in Section 4, and plans for future studies are described in Section 5. The studies presented here were performed in the context of LBNE, but are largely applicable to the new international experimental collaboration at LBNF [1].",

Table 1 is the agenda for each day. Each day, there were approximately two hours of presentations with most of the day reserved for working time in which participants discussed issues arising from the presentations and developed a list of specific studies that are required to understand each systematic effect. Requirements for development of tools and acquisition of external input were also determined. Detector requirements were determined when possible, though generally these will be an output of studies that have not yet been performed.",

GLoBES [2,3] is a software package developed to calculate sensitivities for neutrino oscillation experiments. The LBNE Fast Monte Carlo (Fast MC) is a simulation suite, combining flux simulations from G4LBNE (a GEANT4 [4]-based beam simulation), the GENIE [5] neutrino event generator, and a parameterized detector response used to simulate the energy deposition of each final-state particle. The ND Fast MC is an implementation of a fine-grained tracker (FGT) near detector (ND) in the Fast MC framework. My GLoBES Tools (MGT) is an analysis framework using GLoBES libraries that calculates experimental sensitivity, including the effect of systematic variations, using inputs from a simulation such as the Fast MC. VALOR is a fitting framework that performs a maximum likelihood fit of near detector data to constrain systematic uncertainties and then applies these constraints to oscillation parameter fits of far detector event samples. LArSoft [6] is a full detector response simulation and reconstruction package for liquid argon TPCs, used by multiple experiments. Reconstruction algorithms within LArSoft are under development. Once further development is complete, the LArSoft simulation will be used in conjunction with with the same flux and cross section simulations as the current Fast MC to provide full simulations of a LArTPC far detector at LBNF.",

The sensitivity of long-baseline oscillation parameter measurements has been evaluated in GLoBES fits that account for statistical uncertainties, oscillation parameter uncertainties, and these non-oscillation systematic uncertainties. The latter is accomplished via eight normalization parameters; one each for the signal and background of four simultaneously fit analysis samples (\u03bd e , \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u00b5 ). These eight parameters are assumed to be completely uncorrelated, as any correlated uncertainty is expected to cancel. Estimates for these normalization uncertainties are 5% (1%) signal and 10% (5%) background for the \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd e ) samples. These values reflect the uncorrelated portion of the total uncertainty projections for each sample, including constraints from external and near detector data. The portion of the systematics uncertainties that are correlated amongst analysis sample are expected to largely cancel in combined fits.",

Results from MGT using Fast MC inputs show that a fit to all four far detector samples (\u03bd e , \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u00b5 ) significantly constrains cross-section systematic uncertainty even in the case where multiple cross-section parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously within their GENIE uncertainties. For example, fits are performed in which M QE A and M RES A for charged current (CC) interactions are both allowed to vary within their GENIE uncertainties of \u223c \u00b120%. This essentially allows the constituent sample normalizations in the reconstructed energy spectra to vary by \u223c20%. As seen in the example fit shown in Fig. 4  appearance signal without constraint from the \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 samples. In contrast, for a four-sample fit, the same level of allowed fluctuations lead to a significantly smaller degradation of the CPV sensitivity. Comparing the fraction of \u03b4 CP values for which a 3\u03c3 discovery of CP violation can be made with an exposure of 245 kt-MW-years, i.e., 3\u03c3 CPV coverage, between the two fits, we find a 54% reduction in 3\u03c3 CPV coverage for the \u03bd e appearance-only fit is reduced to a 2% reduction in 3\u03c3 CPV coverage for the four-sample fit. This result includes a 10% uncertainty in the \u03bd/\u03bd cross-section ratio and a 2.5% uncertainty in the \u03bd e /\u03bd \u00b5 cross-section ratio. Preliminary studies from VALOR and the ND Fast MC demonstrate significant constraint on cross-section systematics from the near detector as well. Nuclear models enter into the simulation of neutrino interactions both through modeling of initial-state interactions, i.e., interactions between the initial state of the nucleons and virtual particles within the nucleus with the neutrino, and modeling of final-state interactions (FSI), i.e., interactions of the particles exiting the primary interaction vertex with the nuclear medium. Uncertainties in initial-state interactions due to naive modeling of the environment of the nucleus have thus far been taken into account through inflation of the uncertainties on the free nucleon or quark interaction model, such as M QE",

This could lead to differences in the \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance energy spectra that could be mistaken for CPV. A method to combat this by comparing the \u03bd e and \u03bd e samples to the \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 samples, where CPV effects in oscillation probabilities are negligible, has been suggested. However, this requires that the hadronic final states in the appearance and disappearance samples are comparable. Further work is needed to develop this method and evaluate the potential reduction in related systematic uncertainties.",

The sensitivities quoted are the minimum sensitivity for 100% of \u03b4 CP values in the case of mass hierarchy and 50% of \u03b4 CP values in the case of CP violation. Sensitivities are for true normal hierarchy; neutrino mass hierarchy is assumed to be unknown in the CPV fits.
