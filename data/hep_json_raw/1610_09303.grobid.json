            "text": "The hidden-charm state X(3872) was discovered by the Belle Collaboration in 2003 [1] through its decay to J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the exclusive decay B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Its existence was subsequently confirmed by CDF [2] through its production in pp collisions, and its production was also observed by the BaBar [3] and D0 [4] experiments shortly after. CDF determined [5] that the only possible quantum numbers for X(3872) were J P C = 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ . At the LHC, the X(3872) was first observed by the LHCb Collaboration [6], which finally confirmed its quantum numbers to be 1 ++ [7]. A particularly interesting aspect of the X(3872) is the closeness of its mass, 3871.69 \u00b1 0.17 MeV [8], to the D 0D * 0 threshold, such that it was hypothesised to be a D 0D * 0 molecule with a very small binding energy [9]. A cross-section measurement of promptly produced X(3872) was performed by CMS [10] as a function of p T , and showed the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) prediction [11] for prompt X(3872) production, assuming a D 0D * 0 molecule, to be too high, although the shape of the p T dependence was described fairly well. A later interpretation of X(3872) as a mixed \u03c7 c1 (2P )-D 0D * 0 state, where the X(3872) is produced predominantly through its \u03c7 c1 (2P ) component, was adopted in conjunction with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) NRQCD model and fitted to CMS data, showing good agreement [12].",

The J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state allows good invariant mass resolution through the use of a constrained fit, and provides a straightforward way of comparing the production characteristics of \u03c8(2S) and X(3872) states, which are fairly close in mass. The prompt and nonprompt contributions for \u03c8(2S) and X(3872) are separated, based on an analysis of the displacement of the production vertex. Non-prompt production fractions for \u03c8(2S) and X(3872) are measured, and the X(3872)/\u03c8(2S) production ratios are measured separately for prompt and non-prompt components. The non-prompt results show that while the nonprompt \u03c8(2S) data is readily described by a traditional single-effective-lifetime fit, there are indications in the non-prompt X(3872) data which suggest introducing a two-lifetime fit with both a short-lived and long-lived component. Results are presented here based on both the single-and two-lifetime fit models. In the two-lifetime case, assuming that the short-lived non-prompt component of X(3872) originates from the decays of B c mesons, the best-fit fractional contribution of the B c component is determined. The distributions of the dipion invariant mass in \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays are also measured.

This was verified with simulated data samples. The resolution function F res (\u03c4 ) is parameterised as a weighted sum of three normalised Gaussian functions with a common mean, with respective width parameters \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 \u03c4 , \u03c3 2 = 2\u03c3 \u03c4 and \u03c3 3 = 4\u03c3 \u03c4 .

Figure 3(a) shows the effective pseudo-proper lifetimes \u03c4 eff for non-prompt \u03c8(2S) and X(3872) signals in bins of p T (see also table 3). While for \u03c8(2S) the fitted values of \u03c4 eff are measured to be around 1.45 ps in all p T bins, the signal from X(3872) at low p T tends to have shorter lifetimes, possibly hinting at a different production mechanism at low p T .",
