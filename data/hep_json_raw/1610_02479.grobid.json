We observe \u03c7c1 \u2192 a2(1700)\u03c0 production for the first time, with a significance larger than 17\u03c3. The production of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, J P C = 1 \u2212+ , is investigated, and upper limits for the branching fractions \u03c7c1 \u2192 \u03c01(1400) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , \u03c7c1 \u2192 \u03c01(1600) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , and \u03c7c1 \u2192 \u03c01(2015) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , with subsequent \u03c01(X) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u00b1 decay, are determined.",

Large samples of charmonium states with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , like the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686), are easily produced at e + e \u2212 colliders, and their transitions provide sizable charmonium samples with other J P C quantum numbers, like the \u03c7 c1 (1 ++ ). The \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 decay is suitable for studying the production of exotic mesons with J P C = 1 \u2212+ , which could be observed decaying into the \u03b7\u03c0 final state. The lowest orbital excitation of a two-body combination in \u03c7 c1 decays to three pseudoscalars, for instance \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0, is the Swave transition, in which if a resonance is produced, it has to have J P C = 1 \u2212+ . Several candidates with J P C = 1 \u2212+ , decaying into different final states, such as \u03b7\u03c0, \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0, f 1 (1270)\u03c0, b 1 (1235)\u03c0 and \u03c1\u03c0, have been reported by various experiments, and these have been thoroughly reviewed in Ref. [1]. The lightest exotic meson candidate is the \u03c0 1 (1400) [2], reported only in the \u03b7\u03c0 final state by GAMS [3], KEK [4], Crystal Barrel [5], and E852 [6], but its resonance nature is controversial [7]. The most promising J P C = 1 \u2212+ candidate, the \u03c0 1 (1600) [2], could also couple to the \u03b7\u03c0, since it has been observed in the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 channel by VES [8] and E852 [9].",

However, other possible exotic signals that could be expected have not been observed in either \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. With a more than 15 times larger data sample at BESIII, there is an opportunity to search for the production of \u03c0 1 exotic mesons. In this work we investigate possible production of exotic mesons in the mass region (1.3-2.0) GeV/c 2 , decaying into the \u03b7\u03c0 + + c.c. final state, namely the \u03c0 1 (1400), \u03c0 1 (1600), and \u03c0 1 (2015), using \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. Charge conjugation and isospin symmetry are assumed in this analysis.",

            "text": "Additional motivation for studying these decays is that a very prominent a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 signal of high purity was observed in \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , by CLEO-c [10]. The a 0 (980) was discovered several decades ago, but its nature was puzzling from the beginning, leading to the hypothesis that it is a four-quark rather than an ordinary qq state [11][12][13]. The first coupled meson-meson (\u03b7\u03c0, KK, \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0) scattering amplitudes based on lattice QCD calculations [14] indicate that the a 0 (980) might be a resonance strongly coupled to \u03b7\u03c0 and KK channels, which does not manifest itself as a symmetric bump in the spectra. Recent theoretical work based on the chiral unitarity approach also points that the a 0 (980), as well as the \u03c3 and f 0 (980) states, could be dynamically gener-ated through meson-meson interactions, for example in heavy-meson decays: \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 [15] and \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 [16]. However, there is still no consensus on the exact role that meson-meson loops play in forming of the a 0 (980), which is now generally accepted as a four-quark object, see [17] and reference therein.",

The first direct observation of the decay a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 was reported by CLEO-c [10], using a sample of 26 \u00d7 10 6 \u03c8(3686) decays. The a 0 (980) coupling to the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 channel, g \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 , was determined from \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, although the analysis was not very sensitive to the a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 component in the a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 invariant mass distribution, and g \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 was found to be consistent with zero. In many analyses of a 0 (980) couplings, g \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 has not been measured. For example, its value was fixed in Ref. [20] based on SU(3) flavor-mixing predictions. Using a clean sample of \u03c7 c1 produced in the radiative transition \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 at BESIII, we investigate the \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays to test if the a 0 (980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 invariant mass distribution is sensitive to \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 production. Dispersion integrals in the description of the a 0 (980) line shape are used to determine the a 0 (980) parameters, its invariant mass, m a0(980) , and three coupling constants: g \u03b7\u03c0 , g KK and g \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 .

Two-body structures reported in previous analyses of the \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, by BESII [26] and CLEO [10,27], the a 0 (980)\u03c0, a 2 (1320)\u03c0 and f 2 (1270)\u03b7, are indicated by the long-dash-dotted, dashed and dashdotted arrows pointing into the Dalitz space, respectively. One feature of this distribution is the excess of events in the upper left corner of the Dalitz plot (a), pointed to by the dotted arrows, which cannot be associated with known structures observed in previous analyses of this \u03c7 c1 decay. We hypothesize this is due to a 2 (1700) production. The expected Dalitz plot of a a 2 (1700)\u03c0 signal is shown in Fig. 3(b), obtained assuming that the a 2 (1700) is the only structure produced. The a 2 (1700) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + and a 2 (1700) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 components cannot be easily identified along the dotted arrows in the Dalitz plot, Fig 3(a), but their crossing in the plot shown in Fig. 3 production are evident, as well as a low-mass \u03c0\u03c0 peak, sometimes referred to as the \u03c3 state. In each of these two distributions there is a visible threshold effect. In the \u03c0\u03c0 distribution, there is a structure above the KK threshold, which is too broad to result from the f 0 (980) alone. In the \u03b7\u03c0 distribution, the broadening of the a 0 (980) peak around 1.2 GeV 2 /c 4 could be associated with the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 threshold. By examining various regions in the Dalitz space, we conclude that the cross-channel contamination, or reflections, are not associated with these threshold effects in the data. In order to eliminate background as the source of these peculiar line-shapes, background studies are performed. Namely, we increased the background level by relaxing the kinematic constraint to \u03c7 2 N C /N C < 10 and also suppressed more background by requiring \u03c7 2 N C /N C < 5. In addition we varied the limits on tagging \u03b7 and \u03c7 c1 candidates, as explained in Sec. V.",

The threshold for the S \u2032i (s) components (i = 1, 2) is s \u2032 = 2.23 [GeV/c 2 ] 2 , which is close to the mass of the f 0 (1500), and it is responsible for the peaking of the S \u03c0\u03c0 \u03b7 amplitude in this region, Fig. 6(b). In fact, the S \u2032i (s) components are used instead of the f 0 (1500)\u03b7 amplitude, which would be needed in the optimal solution if only threshold functions z i KK (s) were used in the expansion of the S \u03c0\u03c0 (s)\u03b7 amplitude. With these additional terms, the contribution and significance of \u03c0\u03c0 scalars, the f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500) and f 0 (1710), is negligible, for each. Although this particular set of amplitudes respects the unitarity of the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave, we use the sum of BW to model other spins and final states, namely the f 2 (1270), f 4 (2050), a 2 (1320) and a 2 (1700). Our approach provides reasonable modeling of the \u03c0\u03c0 line shape, and the sum of all \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave components, S KK and S \u03c0\u03c0 , is reported in Table II.

They do not pass the tests for significance and fractional contribution. The non-resonant \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production is found to be negligible.

Results of fitting the mass and width of the a 2 (1700), shown in Table III   are consistent with the values listed by the PDG [2].

Effects of the line shapes of the a 2 (1320), a 2 (1700), f 2 (1270) and f 4 (2050) resonances are taken into account by varying their masses and widths within the respective uncertainties [2], and using values from Table III. The effect of the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave shape is examined in similar way as for the a 2 (1700). The presence of alternative conventional and exotic resonances is also taken into account.

Two possible orbital-momentum configurations for an exotic amplitude are the S-wave and Dwave, and the significance of each is tested individually. We find that the significance of the S-wave is marginal, less than 2\u03c3 for every \u03c0 1 , and the reported significances in Table II result from using the S and D waves together in the fit. The most significant of the three possible exotic states is the \u03c0 1 (1400), with a significance of 3.5\u03c3 and fractional contribution less than 0.6%. This represents a weak evidence for the existence of the \u03c0 1 (1400) because in alternative amplitude configurations, when parameters of other amplitudes are varied, the significance of this state becomes < 3\u03c3. In the nominal amplitude configuration, the significance of each \u03c0 1 (1400) component is less then 3\u03c3, and when taken together, the contribution  of the S-wave is much smaller than the D-wave contribution, pointing that the evidence for the \u03c0 1 (1400) is circumstantial.",

The analysis is repeated by changing other amplitude line shapes, and the background level, in a similar fashion used for deter-  [2]. The largest positive deviation of the exotic candidate yield with respect to the corresponding yield from the modified nominal fit is effectively treated as the systematic error, summed in quadrature with the statistical error on a given exotic state yield. The resulting uncertainty is used to determine the 90% confidence level deviation, and added to the 'nominal' yield of an exotic candidate to obtain the corresponding upper limit for the branching fraction B(\u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + 1 \u03c0 \u2212 ). The branching fractions for the substructures in \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays reported by the PDG [2] are compared in Table V with the values measured in this work, and with the previous most precise measurement (CLEO-c) [10]. The measurement for the f 2 (1270) production is adjusted to account for the measured relative f 2 (1270) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 width. There is a rather large discrepancy between the values for the two most dominant substructures listed by the PDG and the two most recent measurements. There is very good agreement between the last two measurements, suggesting that the PDG values on two-body structures observed in \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 need to be updated. Tables VI summarizes various contributions to the systematic uncertainties in determining the \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction, and Table VII shows the systematics on the fractional contributions of amplitudes in the nominal fit. Systematic uncertainties in determining the \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction stem from uncertainties in charged track and shower reconstruction efficiencies, the contribution of the M 2 multipole transition, amplitude modeling, the background contribution, and the uncertainty in the number of \u03c8(3686) produced at BESIII [23,24]. External sources of uncertainty include the branching fraction B(\u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 ) and the fraction of \u03b7 decays, B(\u03b7) in Eq. (12).

As a general rule, selection criteria were changed to allow for \u2248 1\u03c3 additional background events, based on the numbers from the inclusive MC. We use \u03c7 2 N C /N C < 9 in all three modes when varying the kinematic constraint. Based on these variations, we conclude that the systematic uncertainty associated with the assumption that all charged tracks are pions is negligible. To select \u03c7 c1 candidates, we use photon energy ranges of (0.152-0.187) GeV, in the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel, and (0.150-0.190) GeV, in two \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 channels.
