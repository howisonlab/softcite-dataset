The LHC multi-TeV beams allow for the most energetic fixed-target experiments ever performed, opening new domains of particle and nuclear physics and complementing that of collider physics, in particular that of RHIC and the EIC projects. The luminosity achievable with AFTER using typical targets would surpass that of RHIC by more than 3 orders of magnitude. The fixed-target mode has the advantage to allow for measurements of single-spin asymmetries with polarized target as well as of single-diffractive processes in the target region.",

Thanks to the 7 TeV proton and 2.76 TeV lead LHC beams interacting on a (possibly polarized) fixed-target, many new opportunities open up and could be studied by a future multi-purpose experiment named AFTER, for \"A Fixed-Target ExpeRiment\". With the LHC proton beams, a center-of-mass energy close to 115 GeV can be achieved for the first time in a fixed-target experiment. Moreover, these beams open a unique access to the (essentially unexplored) large negative-x F domain, allow for new investigations of the intrinsic heavy quark distributions, for a first precision measurement of the gluonic content of the neutron and, when the target is polarized, for a study of spin correlations including the Sivers effect.",

In Ultra-Peripheral Collisions (UPCs), two grazing nuclei (or even nucleons) interact electromagnetically and effectively turn heavy-ion colliders into photon colliders (for reviews see [3,4]). The highly boosted electromagnetic field of the nuclei allows for the production of hadronic systems via the exchange of 2\u03b3, of \u03b3IP, or of a single \u03b3 accompanied by nucleon dissociation. The experimental proof of principle has been provided by RHIC [5,6]. In the recent years, the study of the UPCs at the LHC has attracted a lot of interest [7]. For instance, it was shown in [8] that the UPCs in pA and AA collisions would extend the coverage of HERA for the nuclear and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs). Nevertheless, one of the main issue to face in pp and pA runs is the important pile-up, see e.g. [9]. With the slow extraction of the LHC beams by means of a bent crystal, we have evaluated that the pile-up is absent for hydrogen targets. This offers many possibilities like the study of vector-meson elastic and inelastic photoproduction, e.g. pA \u03b3 \u2192 (X ) \u03c8(2S) + X (A) which could not systematically be carried out by H1 and ZEUS, and timelike DVCS pA",

Assuming that the constituents of a given intrinsic heavy-quark Fock state tend to have all the same rapidity, being that of the projectile or that of the target, an excess of quarkonia is expected in the forward (x F > 0.1) or backward (x F < \u22120.1) region, respectively. This hypothesis can account for early \u039b + c data at \u221a s = 62 GeV [11,12], and also possibly for the unexpected observations of leading \u039b b at high x F at \u221a s = 62 GeV [13]. Other hints for enhanced heavy-hadron production at large x F are the claimed production of double-charm \u039e + cc baryons by SELEX [14,15] (so far unseen in e + e \u2212 reactions [16]) and the large-x F production of J/\u03c8 pairs at NA3 [17], consistent with double-IC Fock states [18].

In pA collisions, the cross section should scale as A 2 F 2 A (t), where F A (t) is the nuclear form factor [22].

            "text": "A fixed-target facility (named AFTER) based on the multi-TeV proton or heavy ion beams at the LHC extracted by a bent crystal can provide a novel testing ground for QCD at unprecedented energies and momentum transfers. In this contribution, we briefly pre-sented a short selection of opportunities for exclusive and semi-exclusive physics. Ultraperipheral collisions allow for instance for studies of vector-meson elastic and inelastic production which could not be carried out by H1 and ZEUS, and of the generalized parton distributions via timelike deeply virtual Compton scattering. Experiments at negative x F give the possibility to study intrinsic strangeness and charm in the proton, and give the possibility to look for the doubly and triply heavy baryons undiscovered so far. Hard diffractive reactions allows us to access directly the distribution amplitude of the proton in the diffractive dissociation of the proton into three jets, and to test the pQCD color transparency. Finally, in the very backward region, one can also look for hiddencolor excitations of the deuteron, revealing the genuine six-quark structure beyond the conventional p \u2212 n picture.",
