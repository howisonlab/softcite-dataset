Presence of New Physics can introduce a shift on its value of the order of a percent. The NA62 experiment at CERN SPS used data from a dedicated run in 2007 to perform a measurement of this ratio and probe the lepton universality. The data analysis technique and the final results are presented.",

The obtained misidentification probability P P b \u00b5e as a function of the muon momentum is shown in fig. 1(b).
