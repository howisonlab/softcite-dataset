The existence of a new vector or scalar resonance coupling to a boson pair W \u03b3 or Z \u03b3 is predicted by many physics scenarios, including various new physics models with scalar particles [3,4] and vector particles [5]. The Low Scale Technicolor (LSTC) [5] model is used as a benchmark model for the search for spin-1 resonances decaying to W \u03b3 and Z \u03b3 final states explored in this paper. The discovery of a Higgs boson, with its parameters in agreement with the Standard Model (SM) predictions, does not exclude the full phase space of the LSTC model, and the basic phenomenology would remain valid for a Technicolor model with a light composite Higgs boson. To minimize the model dependence of the search results, the signal cross section is measured within a well defined fiducial region. The pre-E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch.",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector [12] is composed of an inner tracker detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters (HC), and a muon spectrometer (MS) immersed in the magnetic field produced by a system of superconducting toroids. The ID consists of three subsystems: the pixel and silicon microstrip detectors cover the pseudorapidity 1 range |\u03b7| < 2.5, while the transition radiation tracker, made of straw tubes, has an acceptance range of |\u03b7| < 2.0. The calorimeter system covers the range |\u03b7| < 4.9. The highly segmented electromagnetic calorimeter plays a crucial role in electron and photon identification. It is composed of lead absorbers with Liquid Argon (LAr) as the active material and spans |\u03b7| < 3.2. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.8, a pre-sampler detector using a thin layer of LAr is used to correct for the energy lost by electrons and photons upstream of the calorimeter. The hadronic tile calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.7) is a steel/scintillating-tile detector and is located directly outside the envelope of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. The end-caps and forward calorimeters use LAr as the active material, with copper (EM) and tungsten (HC) as absorber materials. The MS is composed of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets of eight coils each, a system of three stations of high precision tracking chambers in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, and a muon trigger system which covers |\u03b7| < 2.4. The precision measurement is ensured by monitored drift tubes and, at large pseudorapidities (|\u03b7| > 2), for the innermost layer, by cathode strip chambers. The muon trigger system is composed of resistive plate chambers in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.05), and thin gap chambers in the end-cap (1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4). The ATLAS trigger system has three distinct levels, L1, L2 and the event filter, where each trigger level refines the decisions made at the previous level. The data used for the present analysis were collected in 2012 from pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC. The total integrated luminosity is 20.3 fb \u22121 with an uncertainty of 2.8% [13]. Events are selected by triggers requiring at least one identified electron or muon. The transverse energy (E T ) threshold for the single-lepton trigger is 24 GeV. The lepton trigger efficiencies are measured using Z boson candidates as a function of the transverse momentum p T and \u03b7. The trigger 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse (x, y) plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The distance R in the \u03b7-\u03c6 space is defined as R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . efficiencies for the leptons are approximately 70% for muons with |\u03b7| < 1.05, 90% for muons in the range 1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2. 4 [14], and 95% for electrons in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

The following parameters are used in the event generation: number of technicolors N TC = 4; techniquark charges Q U = 1 and Q D = 0 for the Z \u03b3 final state and Q U = 1/2 and Q D = \u22121/2 for the W \u03b3 final state.
