The data correspond to an integrated total luminosity of 8.2 (CDF) and 8.6 (D0) fb \u22121 . Compared to the previous Tevatron Higgs boson search combination more data have been added, additional channels have been added, and some previously used channels have been reanalyzed to gain sensitivity. No excess is observed above background expectation, and set 95% C.L. upper limits (median expected) on Higgs boson production at factors of 1.17 (1.16), 1.71 (1.16), and 0.48(0.57) times the SM predictions for Higgs bosons of mass m H =115, 140, and 165 GeV/c 2 , respectively. We exclude a standard-model Higgs boson in the mass range 156-177 GeV/c 2 at the 95% C.L, with an expected exclusion region 148-180 GeV/c 2 . The absence of a Higgs boson signal also constrains some new physics such as 4 th generation models and other exotic models. 4. G.

The global fit from the electroweak precision data indicates that the Higgs boson mass is lighter than 158 GeV/c 2 at 95% confidence level [1]. The direct searches from LEP [2], the Tevatron [3] and LHC [4] further limit the Higgs boson mass between 114.4 and 141 GeV/c 2 . Recently, using 5 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 for each experiment, the AT-LAS and CMS collaborations [5] have reported excesses in the Higgs search channels (\u03b3\u03b3, ZZ * \u2192 4l, and WW * \u2192 2l) with reconstructed invariant mass near 125 GeV/c 2 . The combined statistical significance is about 2.0 \u03c3 including the look elsewhere effect, but nevertheless, this is interesting and requiring more data to confirm or reject the hypothesis.",

For low mass signatures we look for a bb mass resonance in associated with W/Z events where W/Z decays leptonically. We apply b-tagging and advanced multivariate analysis (MVA) technique to suppress large W/Z +jets and top background. For high mass signatures we look for the Higgs boson decaying into WW pair in the inclusive Higgs boson events that lead to many interesting final states. The most sensitive channel is both W decaying leptonically that gives a final state of opposite-sign dilepton, large missing Et, and some jets. Due to missing neutrinos, we have to rely on the event kinematic distributions that distinguish the signal from the background using MVA techniques. There are in total 165 mutually exclusive final states, 94 channels from D0 and 71 channels from CDF.",

Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with truncated Gaussian. Both methods use likelihood calculations based on Poisson probabilities. There are two types of systematic uncertainties that affect the rate and shape of estimated signal and background in a correlated way.

The sizes of one and two sigma bands indicate the width of the LLR background-only distribution. The separation between the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses provides a measure of the search sensitivity, which is about two sigma at low mass and close to 3 sigma at m H = 165 GeV/c 2 .
