They are obtained as a function of the total fractional energy and invariant mass for any di-hadron combination in the same hemisphere as defined by the thrust event-shape variable and its axis. Since same-hemisphere di-hadrons can be assumed to originate predominantly from the same initial parton, di-hadron fragmentation functions are probed. These di-hadron fragmentation functions are needed as an unpolarized baseline in order to quantitatively understand related spin-dependent measurements in other processes and to apply them to the extraction of quark transversity distribution functions in the nucleon. The di-hadron cross sections are obtained from a 655 fb \u22121 data sample collected at or near the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider.",

            "text": "Fragmentation functions allow us to understand the transition of asymptotically free partons into several confined hadrons. They cannot be calculated from first principles and thus need to be extracted experimentally. One of the main ways of obtaining them is via cross section or multiplicity measurements in electron-positron annihilation where no hadrons are present in the initial state. For many processes, factorization is assumed or proven to certain orders of the strong coupling and fragmentation functions as well as parton distribution functions are considered universal. Because of this universality, such functions extracted in one process can be applied to another process. As such, the knowledge of fragmentation functions is, for example, used to extract various spin-dependent parton distribution functions in polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and polarized hadron collisions. In particular, the extraction of the chiral-odd transversity distribution functions [1] and their related tensor charges relies so far entirely on transverse spin dependent fragmentation functions.",

These asymmetries rely on an explicit transverse-momentum dependence of fragmentation functions. The Collins fragmentation function describes a correlation between the direction of an outgoing transversely polarized quark, its spin orientation and the azimuthal distribution of final-state hadrons, and serves as a transverse-spin analyzer. Collins asymmetries were extracted for pions and kaons in several SIDIS measurements so far [4][5][6][7][8], where they are convolved with the transversity distributions of interest, and more recently in proton-proton collisions for pions [9]. The corresponding Collins fragmentation measurements were obtained in various electron-positron annihilation experiments for pions [2,10,11] and recently also kaons [12] based on the description of Ref. [13]. Some of these measurements have already been included in global transversity extractions [14][15][16][17].",

[46], the particle misidentification is corrected using inverted 5 \u00d7 5 particle-misidentification matrices for the five particle hypotheses (pions, kaons, protons, muons, and electrons) for each identified particle, laboratory momentum, and polar angle bin. These matrices are obtained using decays of D * + , \u039b, and J/\u03c8 from data where the true particle type is determined by the charge reconstruction and the invariant mass distribution. Occasionally, when too few events are available in the data, the extracted efficiencies are interpolated and/or extrapolated based on the behavior in the generic MC; this occurs particularly at the boundaries of the acceptance. The matrices are calculated for each of the two-dimensional bins in laboratory momentum and polar angle, with the boundaries of the 17 bins in momentum at (0. In this analysis, the inverted misidentification matrix is applied for each of the identified hadrons by multiplying the respective weights for each hadron being a pion or kaon to obtain the total weight for the di-hadron in any of the four pion-kaon combinations. To confirm the consistency of this treatment, the D 0 branching ratios for the pion-pion and kaon-kaon decay channels to the pion-kaon decay channel are compared to the PDG [47] values and found to be consistent. We also confirm that the total yield of particle pairs is unaffected by this treatment. In particular, for the particle combinations of interest here, there are 2. The corrected yields are distributed among the (z, m h1h2 ) bins according to the corresponding hadron masses: one identified hadron pair appears in several bins with the above-determined weights, depending on the particular hadron combination. The ratios relative to the uncorrected hadron assignment are displayed in Fig. 2, where one can see that the overall corrections are of the order of 20% with notable excursions. The dip at masses around 1.6 to 1.8 GeV is caused by D 0 decays into pion-kaon pairs where the kaon was mis-identified as pion. For the uncertainties on the PID correction, the individual inverted matrix elements were varied by their uncertainties and the resulting variation was taken into account. In addition, for the matrix elements that required extrapolation, two different types of extrapolation based on the MC were considered with the variation around the central value assigned as an additional systematic uncertainty. The total uncertainties due to the PID correction are at the 10% level at small values of z and moderate masses, increasing towards the highest available masses and decreasing for intermediate z bins.",

Since not all z \u00d7 m h1h2 bin combinations are kinematically available, a reduced smearing matrix of only the bin combinations with nonzero entries is extracted based on the generic MC (using the true PID) while other MC settings were used as a consistency check. In the remaining bin combinations, the smearing is relatively moderate and the optimal regularization parameter, as prescribed in Ref. [48], is generally very close to the full rank of the reduced matrices. This indicates that the statistics of matrix and data vectors is sufficiently large so that fluctuations in the MC statistics do not play a significant role. Generally, the unfolded yields are very similar to the raw ones with only some corrections around very narrow resonances. The final before/after ratio plots are displayed in Fig. 3 as a function of (z, m h1h2 ) for pion pairs, where one can see that the ratios are predominantly around unity.",

As many published results do not remove weak decays at all, we will provide both results before and after subtraction of all weak decays based on the MC.

The effect of initialstate radiation is studied by comparing the generated MC cross sections with \"no ISR\" and \"including ISR\" by application of the Pythia switch MSTP (11). The ratios between these options can be seen in Fig. 7 for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs. At small masses, the z behavior is as ex-pected. At low z, ISR yields are slightly larger than the non-ISR yields due to ISR events being able to feeddown to low-z. The CMS energies are no longer sufficient with ISR to populate the higher-z regions and thus the non-ISR cross sections are larger in these regions. At larger masses, this behavior changes drastically and the cross sections including ISR become more than 30% larger than those for non-ISR events. In this case, it is found that when a substantial amount of energy is taken away via ISR photons, the nominal boost, and consequently the hemisphere definitions, become incorrect and ISR events from opposite \"true\" hemispheres enter the yields. This has been verified by explicitly calculating the true hemispheres of hadron pairs in the additionally boosted quark-antiquark system in the presence of ISR photons. These non-ISR to ISR ratios are then used to correct the data using the Pythia default settings. The variations between different MC tunes were taken into account as systematic uncertainties. While the behavior is nearly identical in most settings, the corrections are substantially different for the generic Belle simulations and thus the total systematic uncertainties are dominated by this contribution. For all hadron combinations, the uncertainties range between several percent at low z and masses to close to 100% at high masses.",

Also, the opposite charge-sign combinations are found to be consistent and can be merged where applicable. At the end of these and similar checks, the final di-hadron cross sections and their statistical and total systematic uncertainties can be evaluated for the 6 unique di-hadron combinations.

Figure 8 shows the statistical and total systematic uncertainties for opposite-sign pion pairs. The individual systematic uncertainties from the various correction stages are added in quadrature. The resulting uncertainties are all dominated by the systematics, which are in turn dominated by the ISR systematics at higher z and the PID systematics at lower z, especially for kaon combinations, as well as uncertainties due to the acceptance correction. At lower z and lower masses, the total pion-pair systematic uncertainties are below 10%, while at higher masses, both uncertainties can reach more than 100%.

The very prominent resonances seen are the K 0 S , \u03c1 0 and the Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 decays. Based on MC simulations, the enhancements at around 1.35 GeV and 1.6 GeV can be identified as multi- body or indirect decay products of D mesons as well. At around 1 GeV, the f 0 (980) can be seen. Part of the cross section at low masses, below the \u03c1 0 resonance, originates from partially reconstructed \u03c9 and \u03b7 decays. The same-sign pion pairs generally display a continuous distribution with a slight enhancement at around 1.35 GeV, which again is caused by decay products of D mesons.",

In Fig. 10, the stacked absolute and relative contributions are displayed for unlike-sign pion pairs, separated by parentage of both pions according to their common ancestor. One clearly sees several of the direct two-or three-body decays such as K 0 S , \u03c1 0 , D 0 , \u03b7, etc., as well as pions from different steps in D meson decay chains. A substantial fraction of pion pairs have no common ancestor: they originate directly from the fragmentation chain.

The \u03c6 resonance and (again) the Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 -meson decay are clearly visible. Some enhancements around the D 0 mass can be assigned to D meson decays, except that here D s mesons seem to play a bigger role consistent with the additional strangeness in the selected hadrons. The same-sign kaon pair cross section is again mostly a smooth function of the invariant mass and is increasingly suppressed with z. The small enhancement close to the mass threshold can be, according to MC simulations, potentially related to D 0 -meson decays into a kaon and another hadron, such as the a 1 meson, which can further decay into more kaons.",

In contrast to the previously published z 1 , z 2 dependences, no choice describes the cross sections particularly well, while the overall magnitude and z dependence is again best described by the Pythia default and the updated Belle simulation settings. Qualitatively, the mass behavior is best described by the ALEPH tune although the magnitude at higher z is too large. The reason for the better mass description is likely the different vector-meson and exited-meson parameter values PARJ (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17), which particularly impact the range between 1.1 GeV and 1.6 GeV. The strength of the f 0 (980) seems to be underestimated by all tunes. For pion-kaon and kaon pairs, the behavior is generally similar except that the default settings describe the mass dependence better. This similarity indicates that the differences in the excited meson settings play only a minor role in these comparisons to the data.",

The measurements will allow a more quantitative application of the previously published polarized di-hadron asymmetries in extracting quark transversity distributions and their tensor charges from the corresponding polarized SIDIS and proton-proton collision data. In addition, the cross sections should help to better constrain the fragmentation function parameters in MC simulations that are relevant to studies of either nucleon structure or the size of backgrounds in flavor physics. Apart from a few distinct resonances, the whole mass spectrum has not been measured before.  term in the partial-wave expansion, corresponding to a sin \u03b8 D 3 cos 2 \u03b8 D \u2212 1 moment, does appear to be substantial for pion pairs and even becomes nearly maximal for small fractional energies. An example can be seen in Fig. 15, where it also becomes clear that, at least at lower invariant masses, the magnitude of this moment is dominated by the hadron minimum momentum requirements. For the polarized di-hadron analysis in Ref. [21], one can thus expect a negligible contribution from the p-p interference term of the spin-dependent DiFFs, i.e., to the numerator of Eq.(2) in Ref. [21], due to its sin \u03b8 D cos \u03b8 D modulation [52], attributing the nonvanishishing values of the asymmetries to the s-p interference.",

[52], different partial waves can in principle participate with different strengths. This could be very relevant for the polarized fragmentation function and alter the magnitude of the transversity distributions obtained. For the unpolarized di-hadron cross sections, the corresponding moments of the decay angle, \u03b8 D , relative to the two-hadron direction in its center-of-mass system are studied. Here, the minimal momentum selection removes phase-space for very forward and backward decay angles and prefers decays perpendicular to the di-hadron momentum direction. Comparing the PID corrected (but not unfolded) sine moments of the data to MC at the generator level without a minimum momentum selection, one does see slight increases in the moments. These moments, however, are consistent with a fully tracked and reconstructed MC where such a momentum selection is in place. Again, the sin \u03b8 D cos \u03b8 D moments of either set of MC and data are consistent with zero while the leading s-and p-wave sine modulations are close to unity. An example of the sine moments for unlike-sign pion pairs is shown in Fig. 14. However, in contrast to the asymmetry analysis, the next",
