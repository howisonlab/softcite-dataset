We then interpret the results in benchmark models where the dark gauge symmetry is mediated by a dark vector boson Z d . The dark sector could couple to the SM through kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson [15][16][17]. In this hypercharge portal scenario, the kinetic mixing parameter \u03f5 controls the coupling strength of the dark vector boson and SM particles. If, in addition, the U\u00f01\u00de d symmetry is broken by the introduction of a dark Higgs boson, then there could also be a mixing between the SM Higgs boson and the dark sector Higgs boson [5][6][7][8][9][10]. In this scenario, the Higgs portal coupling \u03ba controls the strength of the Higgs coupling to dark vector bosons. The observed Higgs boson would then be the lighter partner of the new Higgs doublet, and could also decay via the dark sector. There is an additional Higgs portal scenario where there could be a mass-mixing between the SM Z boson and Z d [7,8]. In this scenario, the dark vector boson Z d may couple to the SM Z boson with a coupling proportional to the mass mixing parameter \u03b4.",

            "text": "The presence of the dark sector could be inferred either from deviations from the SM-predicted rates of Drell-Yan (DY) events or from Higgs boson decays through exotic intermediate states. Model-independent upper bounds, from electroweak constraints, on the kinetic mixing parameter of \u03f5 \u2264 0.03 are reported in Refs. [5,18,19] for dark vector boson masses between 1 and 200 GeV. Upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter based on searches for dilepton resonances, pp \u2192 Z d \u2192 ll, below the Zboson mass are found to be in the range of 0.005-0.020 for dark vector boson masses between 20 and 80 GeV [20]. The discovery of the Higgs boson [21][22][23] during Run 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [24,25] opens a new and rich experimental program that includes the search for exotic decays H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l and H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l. This scenario is not entirely excluded by electroweak constraints [5][6][7][8][9][10]18,20]. The H \u2192 ZZ d process probes the parameter space of \u03f5 and m Z d , or \u03b4 and m Z d , where m Z d is the mass of the dark vector boson, and the H \u2192 Z d Z d process covers the parameter space of \u03ba and m Z d [5,6]. DY production, pp \u2192 Z d \u2192 ll, offers the most promising discovery potential for dark vector bosons in the event of no mixing between the dark Higgs boson and the SM Higgs boson. The H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l process offers a discovery potential complementary to the DY process for m Z d < m Z [5,20]. Both of these would be needed to understand the properties of the dark vector boson [5]. If the dark Higgs boson mixes with the SM Higgs boson, the H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l process would be important, probing the dark sector through the Higgs portal coupling [5,6].",

            "text": "This paper presents a search for Higgs bosons decaying to four leptons via one or two Z d bosons using pp collision data at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV collected at the CERN LHC with the ATLAS experiment. The search uses a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb \u22121 with an uncertainty of 3.6% for H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l based on the luminosity calibration used in Refs. [26,27], and 20.3 fb \u22121 with an uncertainty of 2.8% for H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l based on a more recent calibration [28]. Same-flavor decays of the Z and Z d bosons to electron and muon pairs are considered, giving the 4e, 2e2\u03bc, and 4\u03bc final states.  [7,8], the high p T of the Z d boson relative to its mass leads to signatures that are better studied in dedicated searches [29]. The paper is organized as follows. The ATLAS detector is briefly described in Sec. II. The signal and background modeling is summarized in Sec. III. The data set, triggers, and event reconstruction are presented in Sec. IV. Detailed descriptions of the searches are given in Secs. V and VI for H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l and H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l processes, respectively. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Sec. VII.",

In the H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l search, these background processes are normalized with the theoretical cross sections, where the Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios, as well as their uncertainties, are taken from Refs. [40,41]. In the H\u2192ZZ d \u21924l search, the normalization of H\u21924l is determined from data. The cross section for the ggF process has been calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) [42][43][44] and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [45][46][47] in QCD. In addition, QCD soft-gluon resummations calculated in the next-tonext-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) approximation are applied for the ggF process [48]. NLO electroweak (EW) radiative corrections are also applied [49,50]. These results are compiled in Refs. [51][52][53] assuming factorization between QCD and EW corrections. For the VBF process, full QCD and EW corrections up to NLO [54][55][56] and approximate NNLO QCD [57] corrections are used to calculate the cross section. The cross sections for the associated WH and ZH production processes are calculated at NLO [58] and at NNLO [59] in QCD, and NLO EW radiative corrections are applied [60]. The cross section for associated Higgs boson production with a tt pair is calculated at NLO in QCD [61][62][63][64].",

            "text": "The SM ggF and VBF processes producing H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l backgrounds are modeled with POWHEG, PYTHIA8 and CT10 PDFs [33]. The SM WH, ZH, and ttH processes producing H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l backgrounds are modeled with PYTHIA8 with CTEQ6L1 PDFs. (ii) SM ZZ \u00c3 production. The rate of this background is estimated using simulation normalized to the SM cross section at NLO. The ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l background is modeled using simulated samples generated with POWHEG [65] and PYTHIA8 [35] for qq \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 , and gg2ZZ [66] and JIMMY [67] for gg \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 , and CT10 PDFs for both. (iii) Z \u00fe jets and tt. The rates of these background processes are estimated using data-driven methods. However Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to understand the systematic uncertainty on the datadriven techniques. The Z \u00fe jets production is modeled with up to five partons using ALPGEN [68] and is divided into two sources: Z \u00fe light-jets, which includes Zcc in the massless c-quark approximation and Zbb with bb from parton showers; and Zbb using matrix-element calculations that take into account the b-quark mass. The matching scheme of matrix elements and parton shower evolution (see Ref. [69] and the references therein) is used to remove any double counting of identical jets produced via the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower, but this scheme is not implemented for b-jets. Therefore, bb pairs with separation \u0394R \u2261 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi \u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de 2 \u00fe \u00f0\u0394\u03b7\u00de 2 p > 0.4 between the b-quarks are taken from the matrix-element calculation, whereas for \u0394R < 0.4 the parton-shower bb pairs are used. For comparison between data and simulation, the NNLO QCD FEWZ [70,71] and NLO QCD MCFM [72,73] cross-section calculations are used to normalize the simulations for inclusive Z boson and Zbb production, respectively. The tt background is simulated with MC@NLO-4.06 [74] with parton showers and underlying-event modeling as implemented in HERWIG 6.5.20 [75] and JIMMY. The AUET2C [76] tune for the underlying events is used for tt with CT10 PDFs. (iv) SM WZ and WW production. The rates of these backgrounds are normalized to theoretical calculations at NLO in perturbative QCD [77]. The simulated event samples are produced with SHERPA [78] and CT10 PDFs. (v) Backgrounds containing J=\u03c8 and \u03a5, namely ZJ=\u03c8 and Z\u03a5. These backgrounds are normalized using the ATLAS measurements described in Ref. [79]. These processes are modeled with PYTHIA8 [35] and CTEQ6L1 PDFs. Differing pileup conditions (multiple proton-proton interactions in the same or neighboring bunch crossings) as a function of the instantaneous luminosity are taken into account by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events generated with PYTHIA8 onto the hard-scattering process and reweighting them according to the distribution of the mean number of interactions observed in data. The MC generated samples are processed either with a full ATLAS detector simulation [80] based on the GEANT4 program [81] or a fast simulation based on the parametrization of the response to the electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the ATLAS calorimeters [82] and a detailed simulation of other parts of the detector and the trigger system. The results based on the fast simulation are validated against fully simulated samples and the difference is found to be negligible. The simulated events are reconstructed and analyzed with the same procedure as the data, using the same trigger and event selection criteria.",

The clusters matched to tracks are required to satisfy a set of identification criteria such that the longitudinal and transverse shower profiles are consistent with those expected from electromagnetic showers. The electron transverse momentum is computed from the cluster energy and the track direction at the interaction point. Selected electrons must satisfy E T > 7 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.47. Each electron must have a longitudinal impact parameter (z 0 ) of less than 10 mm with respect to the reconstructed primary vertex, defined as the vertex with at least three associated tracks for which the P p 2 T of the associated tracks is the highest. Muon candidates are formed by matching reconstructed ID tracks with either complete or partial tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer [85]. If a complete track is present, the two independent momentum measurements are combined; otherwise the momentum is measured using the ID. The muon reconstruction and identification coverage is extended by using tracks reconstructed in the forward region (2.5 < j\u03b7j < 2.7) of the MS, which is outside the ID coverage. In the center of the barrel region (j\u03b7j < 0.1), where there is no coverage from muon chambers, ID tracks with p T > 15 GeV are identified as muons if their calorimetric energy deposits are consistent with a minimum ionizing particle. Only one muon per event is allowed to be reconstructed in the MS only or identified with the calorimeter. Selected muons must satisfy p T > 6 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.7. The requirement on the longitudinal impact parameter is the same as for electrons except for the muons reconstructed in the forward region without an ID track. To reject cosmic-ray muons, the impact parameter in the bending plane (d 0 ) is required to be within 1 mm of the primary vertex.",

Uncertainties on the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies, as well as on the energy and momentum reconstruction and scale are described in detail in Refs. [26,27], and shown in Table III. The lepton identification is the dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainties on the ZZ \u00c3 background. The largest uncertainty in the H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l search is the normalization of the tt and Z \u00fe jets backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties related to the determination of selection efficiencies of isolation and impact parameters requirements are shown to be negligible in comparison with other systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty in luminosity [28] is applied to the ZZ \u00c3 background normalization. The electron energy scale uncertainty is determined from Z \u2192 ee samples and for energies below 15 GeV from J=\u03c8 \u2192 ee decays [26,27]. Final-state QED radiation modeling and background contamination affect the mass scale uncertainty negligibly. The muon momentum scale systematic uncertainty is determined from Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc samples and from J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc as well as \u03a5 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays [26,27]. Theory related systematic uncertainties on the Higgs production cross section and branching ratios are discussed in Refs. [39][40][41], but do not apply in this search since the H \u2192 4l normalization is obtained from data. Uncertainties on the m 34 shapes arising from theory uncertainties on the PDFs and renormalization and factorization scales are found to be negligible. Theory cross-section uncertainties are applied to the ZZ \u00c3 background. Normalization uncertainties are taken into account for the Z \u00fe jets and tt backgrounds based on the data-driven determination of these backgrounds.",

            "text": "The simplest benchmark model adds to the SM Lagrangian [6][7][8]10] a U\u00f01\u00de d gauge symmetry that introduces the dark vector boson Z d . The dark vector boson may mix kinetically with the SM hypercharge gauge boson with kinetic mixing parameter \u03f5 [6,10]. This enables the decay H \u2192 ZZ d through the hypercharge portal. The Z d is assumed to be narrow and on shell. Furthermore, the present search assumes prompt Z d decays consistent with current bounds on \u03f5 from electroweak constraints [18,19]. The coupling of the Z d to SM fermions is given in Eq. 47of Ref. [6] to be linear in \u03f5, so that BR\u00f0Z d \u2192 ll\u00de is independent of \u03f5 due to cancellations [6]. In this model, the H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l search can be used to constrain the hypercharge kinetic mixing parameter \u03f5 as follows: the upper limit on R B shown in Fig. 4 leads to an upper limit on BR\u00f0H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l\u00de assuming the SM branching ratio of H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l of 1.25 \u00d7 10 \u22124 [40,41] as shown in Fig. 5. The limit on \u03f5 can be obtained directly from the BR\u00f0H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l\u00de upper bounds and by using    of Ref. [5]. The 95% C.L. upper bounds on \u03f5 are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of m Z d in the case \u03f5 \u226b \u03ba where \u03ba is the Higgs portal coupling.",

[7,8] where the SM is extended with a dark vector boson and another Higgs doublet, and a mass mixing between the dark vector boson and the SM Z boson is introduced. This model explores how a U\u00f01\u00de d gauge interaction in the hidden sector may manifest itself in the decays of the Higgs boson. The model also assumes that the Z d , being in the hidden sector, does not couple directly to any SM particles including the Higgs boson (i.e. the SM particles do not carry dark charges). However, particles in the extensions to the SM, such as a second Higgs doublet, may carry dark charges allowing for indirect couplings via the Z-Z d mass mixing. The possibility of mixing between the SM Higgs boson with other scalars such as the dark sector Higgs boson is not considered for simplicity. The Z-Z d massmixing scenario also leads to potentially observable H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l decays at the LHC even with the total integrated luminosity collected in Run 1. The partial widths of H \u2192 ZZ d \u2192 4l and H \u2192 ZZ d are given in terms of the Z-Z d mass-mixing parameter \u03b4 and m Z d in Eq. 34of Ref. [8] and Eq. (A.4) of Ref. [7], respectively. As a result, using the measurement of the relative branching ratio R B described in this paper, one may set upper bounds on the product \u03b4 2 \u00d7 BR\u00f0Z d \u2192 2l\u00de as a function of m Z d as follows.

After the small mass difference requirements between the SFOS lepton pairs, the estimated background contributions, coming from H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l and ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l, are small. These backgrounds are normalized with the theoretical calculations of their cross sections. The other backgrounds are found to be negligible. Since there is no significant excess, upper bounds on the signal strength, defined as the ratio of the H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l rate normalized to the SM H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l expectation are set as a function of the hypothesized m Z d . In a benchmark model where the SM is extended with a dark vector boson and a dark Higgs boson, the measured upper bounds on the signal strength are used to set limits on the branching ratio of H \u2192 Z d Z d and on the Higgs boson mixing parameter as a function of m Z d [5,6].",

The mass difference \u0394m is expected to be minimal for the signal since the two dilepton systems should have invariant masses consistent with the same m Z d . No requirement is made on \u0394m; it is used only to select a unique quadruplet with the smallest \u0394m. Subsequently, isolation and impact parameter significance requirements are imposed on the leptons of the selected quadruplet as described in Ref. [39]. Figure 8 shows the minimal value of \u0394m for the 2e2\u03bc final state after the impact parameter significance requirements. Similar distributions are found for the 4e and 4\u03bc final states.

The effects of PDFs, \u03b1 S , and renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties on the total inclusive cross sections for the Higgs production by ggF, VBF, VH and ttH are obtained from Refs. [40,41]. The renormalization, factorization scales and PDFs and \u03b1 S uncertainties are applied to the ZZ \u00c3 background estimates. The uncertainties due to the limited number of MC events in the tt, Z \u00fe jets, ZJ=\u03c8, Z\u03a5 and WW=WZ background simulations are estimated as described in Sec. VI C. The luminosity uncertainty [28] is applied to all signal yields, as well as to the background yields that are normalized with their theory cross sections. The detector systematic uncertainties due to uncertainties in the electron and muon identification efficiencies are estimated within the acceptance of the signal region requirements. There are several components to these uncertainties. For the muons, uncertainties in the reconstruction and identification efficiency, and in the momentum resolution and scale, are included. For the electrons, uncertainties in the reconstruction and identification efficiency, the isolation and impact parameter significance requirements, and the energy scale and energy resolution are considered. The systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table IV. Figures 11 and 13 show the distributions of the dilepton invariant mass (for m 12 and m 34 combined) and the absolute mass difference \u0394m \u00bc jm 12 \u2212 m 34 j after the loose signal region requirements. Four data events pass the loose signal region requirements, one in the 4e channel, two in the 4\u03bc channel and one in the 2e2\u03bc channel. Two of these four events pass the tight signal region requirements: the event in the 4e channel and one of the events in the 4\u03bc channel. The event in the 4e channel has dilepton masses of 21.8 and 28.1 GeV as shown in Fig. 11, and is consistent with a Z d   mass in the range 23.5 \u2264 m Z d \u2264 26.5 GeV. For the event in the 4\u03bc channel that passes the tight signal region requirements, the dilepton invariant masses are 23.2 and 18.0 GeV as shown in Fig. 11, and they are consistent with a Z d mass in the range 20.5 \u2264 m Z d \u2264 21.0 GeV. In the m Z d range of 15 to 30 GeV where four data events pass the loose signal region requirements, histogram interpolation [87] is used in steps of 0.5 GeV to obtain the signal acceptances and efficiencies at the hypothesized m Z d . The expected numbers of signal, background and data events, after applying the tight signal region requirements, are shown in Table V. For each m Z d , in the absence of any significant excess of events consistent with the signal hypothesis, the upper limits are computed from a maximum-likelihood fit to the numbers of data and expected signal and background events in the tight signal regions, following the CL s modified frequentist formalism [88,89] with the profilelikelihood test statistic [90,91]. The nuisance parameters associated with the systematic uncertainties described in Sec. VI D are profiled. The parameter of interest in the fit is the signal strength \u03bc d defined as the ratio of the H \u2192 Z d Z d \u2192 4l rate relative to the SM H \u2192 ZZ \u00c3 \u2192 4l rate:",

The simplest benchmark model is the SM plus a dark vector boson and a dark Higgs boson as discussed in Refs. [6,10], where the branching ratio of Z d \u2192 ll is given as a function of m Z d . This can be used to convert the measurement of the upper bound on the signal strength \u03bc d into an upper bound on the branching ratio BR\u00f0H \u2192 Z d Z d \u00de assuming the SM Higgs boson production cross section. Figure 16 shows the 95% C.L. upper limit on the branching ratio of H \u2192 Z d Z d as a function of m Z d using the combined \u03bc d of the three final states. The weaker bound at higher m Z d is due to the fact that the branching ratio Z d \u2192 ll drops slightly at higher m Z d [6] as other decay channels become accessible. The H \u2192 Z d Z d decay can be used to obtain an m Z d -dependent limit on an Higgs mixing parameter \u03ba 0 [6]:  ",
