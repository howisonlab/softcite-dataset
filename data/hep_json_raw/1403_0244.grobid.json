For the analysis here presented, the detector was used to measure the atmospheric muon charge ratio in the TeV region. OPERA collected chargeseparated cosmic ray data between 2008 and 2012. More than 3 million atmospheric muon events were detected and reconstructed, among which about 110000 multiple muon bundles. The charge ratio R \u03bc \u2261 N \u03bc + /N \u03bc \u2212 was measured separately for single and for multiple muon events. The analysis exploited the inversion of the magnet polarity which was performed on purpose during the 2012 Run. The combination of the two data sets with opposite magnet polarities allowed minimizing systematic uncertainties and reaching an accurate determination of the muon charge ratio. Data were fitted to obtain relevant parameters on the composition of primary cosmic rays and the associated kaon production in the forward fragmentation region. In the surface energy range 1-20 TeV investigated by OPERA, R \u03bc is well described by a parametric model including only pion and kaon contributions to the muon flux, showing no significant contribution of the prompt component. The energy independence supports the validity of Feynman scaling in the fragmentation region up to 200 TeV/nucleon primary energy.",

A charge ratio larger than unity reflects the abundance of protons over heavier nuclei in the primary cosmic radiation. The charge asymmetry is preserved in the secondary hadron production, and consequently in the muon fluxes, due to the steepness of the primary spectrum which enhances the forward fragmentation region [1]. The kaon contribution to the muon flux increases with the muon energy. Since the production of positive kaons is favoured by the associated production K + , the muon charge ratio is expected to rise with energy. Assuming the hypothesis of complete scaling we expect an energy independent charge ratio above the TeV energy region at sea level [1] once the kaon contribution to the muon flux reached its asymptotic value [2]. At higher energies, around O(100) TeV, the heavy flavor contribution, as well as changes in the primary composition, may become significant.",

[7], where the z-axis points toward the CNGS direction, muons travelling toward the positive z-axis are defined as south-oriented (SO), while muons travelling toward the negative z-axis are defined as northoriented (NO). A muon crosses a magnet arm in one of these two possible \"orientations\". South-oriented \u03bc + and northoriented \u03bc \u2212 are deflected toward west in the first arm in SP mode. The reversals of either the muon incoming orientation or the polarity mode are equivalent ways to exchange the muon bending sign. We computed the ratio A i of the number N i of charge-reconstructed muons in SP mode to the number in IP mode (normalized by their polarity live time), A i = (N i ) S P /(N i ) I P for the two orientations in each magnet arm i. The results are reported in Table 3. The values of A i obtained in one orientation are all compatible with the values obtained in the other orientation, as expected from a charge-symmetric spectrometer. The individual comparison between A i (SO) and A i (NO) for each arm disposes of possible small live time differences among PT stations. The results are consistent with unity within statistical errors.",

The fit yields f \u03c0 + = 0.5512 \u00b1 0.0014 and f K + = 0.705 \u00b1 0.014, corresponding to a muon charge ratio from pion decay R \u03c0 = 1.228 \u00b1 0.007 and a muon charge ratio from kaon decay R K = 2.39 \u00b1 0.16. 1 Taking into account various models for charm production, namely RQPM [18], QGSM [18] and VFGS [19], the positive pion and kaon fractions obtained from the fit are unchanged  Fig. 3 The muon charge ratio measured by OPERA as a function of the vertical surface energy E \u03bc cos \u03b8 * (black points). Our data are fitted together with the L3+C [12] data (open triangles). The fit result is shown by the continuous line. The dashed, dotted and dash-dot lines are, respectively, the fit results with the inclusion of the RQPM [18], QGSM [18] and VFGS [19] models for prompt muon production in the atmosphere. The vertical inner bars denote the statistical uncertainty, the full bars show the total uncertainty. Results from other experiments, MINOS Near and Far Detectors [13,14], CMS [15] and Utah [16], are shown for comparison within statistical errors. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The prompt muon component does not significantly contribute to R \u03bc up to E \u03bc cos \u03b8 * 10 TeV.",

In general, with a curvature bias that shifts the bending angle distribution, a different charge misidentification \u03b7 + and \u03b7 \u2212 for positive and negative muons is expected for both standard and inverted magnet polarity. Given the symmetry of the detector, the relations \u03b7 + S P = \u03b7 \u2212 I P and \u03b7 \u2212 S P = \u03b7 + I P are valid. However we verified that after the application of the second selection criterion (the bending angle cut) the charge misidentification \u03b7 is insensitive to the charge sign. We applied a rigid curvature bias \u03b4\u03c6 s and observed that the bin construction clearly separates positive and negative bins. Therefore a symmetric misidentification \u03b7 = \u03b7 + = \u03b7 \u2212 is assumed. Each energy bin content N \u00b1 is the integral of the true charged muon flux \u03bc convolved with the migration matrix U and corrected for the charge misidentification.
