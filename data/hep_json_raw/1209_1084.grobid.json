            "text": "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is fully equipped to measure hard probes in the di-muon decay channel in the high multiplicity environment of nucleus-nucleus collisions. Such probes are especially relevant for studying the quark-gluon plasma since they are produced at early times and propagate through the medium, mapping its evolution. CMS has measured the nuclear modification factors of non-prompt J/\u03c8 (from b-hadron decays) and prompt J/\u03c8 in PbPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. For prompt J/\u03c8 with relatively high p T (p T =6.5-30 GeV/c), a strong, centrality-dependent suppression is observed in PbPb collisions, compared to the yield in pp collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions. In the same kinematic range, a suppression of non-prompt J/\u03c8, which is sensitive to the in-medium b-quark energy loss, is measured for the first time. Results from the 2010 data taking period are reported and an outlook on the 2011 data analysis will be given.",

            "text": "The strongly interacting matter consists of a deconfined and chirally-symmetric system of quarks and gluons, called \"Quark-Gluon-Plasma\" (QGP) at large energy densities and high temperatures. One of the strongest signatures of the existence of the QGP is the quarkonia states suppression, which is thought to be a direct effect of deconfinement, when the binding potential between the constituents of a quarkonium state is screened by the colour charges of the surrounding light quarks and gluons. However, there are further possible changes to the quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions. One initial effect, i.e. the modifications of the parton distribution functions inside the nucleus (nuclear shadowing), can reduce the production of quarkonia without the presence of a QGP [1]. A second effect, related to the large number of heavy quarks produced in heavy-ion collisions in particular at the energies accessible by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), could lead to an increased production of quarkonia via statistical recombination [2].",
