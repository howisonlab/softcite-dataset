They cover the kinematic domain in the photon virtuality Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 , 0.004 < x < 0.4, 0.2 < z < 0.85 and 0.1 < y < 0.7. In addition, a leading-order pQCD analysis was performed using the pion multiplicity results to extract quark fragmentation functions.",

            "text": "Hadron production in semi-inclusive measurements of deepinelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (SIDIS) is one of the most powerful tools to investigate the structure and formation of hadrons. Within the standard framework of leading-twist perturbative QCD (pQCD), factorisation theorems [1] allow one to write the SIDIS cross section as a convolution of hard scattering cross sections, which are calculable in pQCD, with non-perturbative Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and Fragmentation Functions (FFs). The PDFs account for the partonic structure of hadrons in the initial state. The FFs encode the details about the hadronisation mechanism that describes the transition from final-state partons into colour-neutral hadrons. Both types of functions are believed to be universal, i.e. process independent, and can be interpreted in leading-order (LO) as number densities. While PDFs have been studied in detail for several decades and are hence known with good precision, new accurate measurements are necessary to constrain the FFs. In what follows, we will restrict ourselves to transverse-momentum-integrated PDFs and FFs.",

            "text": "The universality of FFs allows their determination from different high-energy processes, which provide complementary information on the hadronisation mechanism and cover complementary kinematic ranges. The study of hadron production in the electronpositron annihilation process is particularly well suited because its cross section has no dependence on parton densities and gives direct access to FFs. Measurements cover a wide range in the characteristic hard scale, from 10 GeV for recent data from BELLE [2] and BaBar [3] to 100 GeV at the Z boson mass at LEP [4] and SLAC [5], at which only the singlet combination of FFs is accessible. In spite of the high precision, these e + e \u2212 data cannot be used to disentangle quarks from anti-quarks, as they only access the sum of quark and antiquark FFs and hence do not allow for a full flavour separation. Hadron multiplicity data from SIDIS provide charge and full flavour separation of fragmentation functions. The SIDIS data from fixed target experiments explore characteristic hard scales down to 1 GeV. The large kinematic range spanned by the mentioned reactions allows one to study QCD scaling violations, which also constrains the gluon FF. The latter is indirectly probed by hadron-hadron collisions, e.g. at RHIC [6], via singleinclusive hadron production at high transverse momentum [7].",

The direction of the reconstructed tracks at the interaction point is determined with a precision of 0.2 mrad, and the momentum resolution is 1.2% in the first spectrometer stage and 0.5% in the second. Muons are identified downstream of hadron absorbers. A ring imaging Cherenkov counter (RICH) in the first stage is used for pion, kaon and proton separation [11]. It was filled with a C 4 F 10 radiator leading to thresholds for pion, kaon and proton detection of about 2.9 GeV/c, 9 GeV/c and 18 GeV/c respectively. In the central part, photon detection was performed using multi-anode photomultiplier tubes that yielded high photodetection efficiency and a fast response in the high rate environment. In the outer part, multi-wire proportional chambers with CsI cathodes were used to detect the UV Cerenkov photons. The trigger, based on pairs of hodoscopes, selected scattered muons above a minimum scattering angle.",

            "text": "The cross section for exclusive production of \u03c1 0 calculated in HEPGEN is normalised to the phenomenological model of Ref. [20]. The theoretical uncertainty on the predicted cross section close to COMPASS kinematics amounts to about 30%. This results in an uncertainty on the diffractive \u03c1 0 correction factor, which amounts to at most 30% and depends on the kinematic range. Nuclear effects may be caused by the presence of 3 He/ 4 He and 6 Li in the target. A detailed study of such effects was previously performed by the EMC [9] in a similar kinematic range for carbon, copper and tin. A z-dependent decrease of 5% was observed for the multiplicities of copper compared to the ones of deuterium. While the effect was larger for tin, no such effect was found for carbon, so that possible nuclear effects in the present experiment are expected to be very small and are hence neglected.",

The unfavoured FF is smaller than the favoured one, as expected, and their ratio is seen to decrease with z. The shaded bands depict the total uncertainty. These bands are determined using a MC sampling method (bootstrap method in Ref. [30]). One hundred replicas of the original data set are built by generating standard normal deviates as noise factors that are then multiplied by the data point uncertainties and added to the original data point. For the statistical uncertainty and uncorrelated systematic uncertainty the noise factor is generated for each point separately, while for the correlated systematic uncertainty the noise factor is generated only once per replica. The bands widths are given by the root mean square of the corresponding distributions. Note that for the ratio D \u03c0 fav /D \u03c0 unf most of the correlated systematic uncertainties cancel.",
