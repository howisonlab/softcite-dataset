In this search, the W boson from the top quark is required to decay into an electron or a muon and a neutrino. No deviation from the standard model prediction is observed, and upper limits are set on the production cross-section for resonant and non-resonant production of an invisible exotic state in association with a right-handed top quark. In the case of resonant production, for a spin-0 resonance with a mass of 500 GeV, an effective coupling strength above 0.15 is excluded at 95 % confidence level for the top quark and an invisible spin-1/2 state with mass between 0 and 100 GeV. In the case of non-resonant production, an effective coupling strength above 0.2 is excluded at 95 % confidence level for the top quark and an invisible spin-1 state with mass between 0 and 657 GeV.",

In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, an optimisation of the event selection is performed with simulated data, using wellmodelled variables. The lepton and the b-tagged jet are closer to each other when originating from the decay of a top quark than in the case of W +jets and multijet background events. Hence, a criterion imposing the rejection of events with large values of the difference in azimuth between the lepton and the b-tagged jet | \u03c6( , b)| is tested, together with increased m T ( , E miss T ) threshold values. Figure 2 shows the distributions of these two variables for the expected background contribution, and for two mass hypotheses considered for each signal model. For each set of cuts on m T ( , E miss T ) and | \u03c6( , b)|, the sensitivity is estimated by calculating the expected limit on the production cross-section with the procedure described in Sect. 6 including the systematic uncertainties detailed in Sect. 5. The optimisation was performed using one mass hypothesis m( f met ) = 100 GeV for the resonant model, for which the kinematic distributions have only small variations in the studied mass range. For the non-resonant model, characterised by larger variations of the kinematic distributions with v met , four signal mass hypotheses were studied: m(v met ) = 0, 100, 300, and 600 GeV.

Table 1 reports the expected event yields for the background and signal processes and the observed event yields in the SRI and SRII signal regions. As no excess is observed in data, 95 % CL upper limits on the signal production crosssections are set with the CL s procedure [83,84]. A loglikelihood ratio (LLR) is used as the test statistic, defined as the ratio of the signal-plus-background hypothesis to the background-only hypothesis. For a given hypothesis, the combined likelihood is the product of the likelihoods for the two channels considered (electron and muon), each resulting from the product of a Poisson distribution representing the statistical fluctuations of the expected total event yield, and of Gaussian distributions representing the effect of the systematic uncertainties. Pseudo-experiments are generated for both hypotheses, taking into account correlations across channels and processes. The fraction of pseudo-experiments for the signal-plus-background (background-only) hypothesis with LLR larger than a threshold defines CL s+b (CL b ). This threshold is set to the observed (background median) LLR for the observed (expected) limit. Signal cross-sections for which CL s = CL s+b /CL b < 0.05 are considered excluded at the 95 % CL. Figure 6 shows the expected and observed 95 % CL excluded cross-section times branching ratio as a function   The cross-sections are proportional to the square of the effective coupling. Thus, a 95 % CL upper limit on a res and a non-res as a function of the mass of the invisible states is extracted. The results are shown in Fig. 7. This upper limit is set assuming that the coupling has no effect on the signal acceptance modelling. In the case of the resonant model, in which the increase of the resonance width with increasing coupling strength changes the signal kinematics, this assumption is validated by using two dedicated simulated samples produced with a res = 0.5 and a res = 1.0 instead of a res = 0.2. These two hypotheses are excluded at 95 % CL with the same limit-setting procedure. Since the kinematic distributions are similar in the whole m( f met ) range, this assumption is valid for all values of the f met mass. Tables 2  and 3 give the expected and observed 95 % CL upper lim- its on the effective coupling as a function of the mass of the invisible state, for the resonant and non-resonant model, respectively.",

Two classes of signal models are studied, producing right-handed top quarks together with exotic neutral particles giving rise to missing energy. The semi-leptonic decay mode of the top quark is exploited: events with one isolated electron or muon and one b-tagged jet are selected. No significant deviation from the standard model predictions is observed. Upper limits on the signal cross-sections and on the corresponding effective couplings are set at 95 % CL using the CL s method. In the case of the production of a 500 GeV spin-0 resonance, effective coupling strengths above a res = 0.15 are excluded for a mass of the invisible spin-1/2 state between 0 and 100 GeV. In the case of non-resonant production, effective coupling strengths above a non-res = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 are excluded for a mass of the invisible spin-1 state up to 432, 657, and 796 GeV, respectively. The observed 95 % CL limits are compatible with the expectations. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
