At fixed-target center-of-mass energies of \u223c 20 \u2212 40 GeV, next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations underpredict experimental results by factors of 1.5 or more. A technique called threshold resummation, which recovers a portion of the higher-order terms in the strong coupling constant expansion, has been demonstrated to improve agreement with lowerenergy data, and the techniques for applying cuts in calculations to match experimental data have been recently improved (see [1] and the discussion and references therein). It is interesting to test the relevance of this technique at energies between those of fixed-target experiments and typical collider energies.",

Single particles were generated over 2\u03c0 in azimuth and one unit in rapidity, with a vertex position distribution that reproduced that of the real data, then passed through a full GEANT 3.21 [9] detector simulation. The efficiencies for negative particles are shown in Fig. 3; those for positive particles were similar. The efficiencies for the particle species increase as a function of p T and differ from one another due to decays in flight in the case of the pions and kaons, as well as due to mass effects, since all species were generated with a flat distribution over one unit of rapidity.

In particular, the dependence on the choice of factorization and renormalization scale (\u00b5) is greatly reduced in the NLL calculation.

For the pions, measurements at two different rapidities, y = 2.7 and y = 3.3, are shown, illustrating the strong dependence on rapidity, which is reasonably reproduced by the calculations at both NLO and NLL. The positive kaons, measured at y = 3.2, are also reasonably described in the measured p T range by both NLO and NLL calculations; however, the negative kaons are underpredicted by an order of magnitude, possibly indicating that the kaon FFs need to be re-examined. Figures 7 and 8 show the double-helicity asymmetry for positive and negative charged hadrons, respectively. Similar to previous PHENIX and STAR A LL measurements performed at midrapidity at \u221a s = 200 GeV [3,4,5,6,7] as well as a previous PHENIX measurement of A LL of midrapidity neutral pions at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV [2], the results for both positive and negative hadrons are consistent with zero.",

As the cross section measurements indicate that NLL threshold resummation may improve the description of the experimental data, for DSSV, both NLO and NLL calculations are shown, with the NLL calculations being slightly smaller. The asymmetry was calculated separately for charged pions, kaons, and protons using DSS FFs for identified particles [17,13], then combined with weights reflecting the relative detection efficiency of each species as a function of p T , calculated from the curves shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that for the cross section measurements, this correction was done directly to the data, and non-identified charged hadron FFs were used to perform the calculations. For the A LL measurement, the correction must be done to the theoretical calculations because the species dependence of the asymmetry cannot be determined from the data.",
