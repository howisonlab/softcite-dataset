In the first interaction point of the new collider the MultiPurpose Detector (MPD) intends to study properties of hot dense nuclear matter in heavy ions collisions. The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) in the second interaction point will be constructed for investigation of the nucleon spin structure in collisions of longitudinally and transversely polarised protons and deuterons at \u221a s up to 27 GeV and luminosity up to 10 32 s \u22121 cm \u22122 . The measurement of TMD PDFs for quarks and gluons using such reactions as the Drell-Yan process, charmonia and prompt photon production is the main goal of the experiment [1,2].",

The authors in [7] pointed out that the asymmetry A \u03b3 N at large positive x F is dominated by quarkgluon correlations while at large negative x F it is dominated by pure gluon-gluon correlations as it was concluded in [8]. The further development of the corresponding formalism can be found in [9,10]. It is important to notice that the corresponding known non-zero asymmetry in \u03c0 0 production, A \u03c0 0 N [11], could be controlled in parallel. The first attempt to measure A \u03b3 N at \u221a s = 19.4 GeV was performed in the fixed target experiment E704 at Fermilab in the kinematic range \u22120.15 < x F < 0.15 and 2.5 GeV/c < p T < 3.1 GeV/c. The results were consistent with zero asymmetry within large statistical and systematic uncertainties [12].  The study of prompt-photon production at large transverse momentum with longitudinally polarised proton beams could provide the access to gluon polarisation \u2206g via the measurement of longitudinal double spin asymmetry A \u03b3 LL [13]. Assuming dominance of the gluon Compton scattering process, the asymmetry A \u03b3 LL can be presented as [14]",

Data sample corresponds to 10 7 s of data taking (about 100 days) with average luminosity L = 10 32 s \u22121 cm \u22122 . The inefficiency of the photon reconstruction is caused only by geometrical acceptance and material distribution, no threshold for photon reconstruction in the ECAL. LO calculations are used for the GCS cross-section. Only \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay is taken into account as background. Average \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is about 70%. Relative accuracy for the Monte Carlo description of photon reconstruction is assumed to be 2%. Two subsamples with equal statistics are collected with each combination of spin orientations. Absolute polarisation of the beam is assumed to be exactly equal to 100%. We also ignore any uncertainties related with the control of the beam polarisation(s) and luminosity. Since low-p T region is useless due to a huge background while at high-p T the statistics is very limited, a reasonable cut on transverse momentum of photon has to be applied in order to maximize the accuracy of the planned measurements. For the running conditions mentioned above the optimal value lies in the range from 5 to 6 GeV/c. The total amount of the detected GCS photons with p T > 5 GeV/c is expected to be about 6 \u00d7 10 6 . Figure 5(a) shows the distribution of p T vs. x F for GCS photons.The expected accuracy of A N and A LL measurement in each of four intervals in x F in the range from -0.89 to 0.89 is shown in Fig 5(b). The results of previous measurement and the theoretical expectations are also presented on the plot.",

It is a good time to come back with a new level of experimental techniques and theoretical understanding. The SPD detector at the NICA collider provides a good chance to perform such kind of measurements. Preliminary analysis of the background conditions shows that the measurement of asymmetries in the prompt-photon production cross section on the level of a few per cent is possible at SPD conditions. Taking into account quite minimalistic requirements to the tracking system of the SPD detector, the study of the prompt-photon production could be the first stage of the SPD setup operation.",
