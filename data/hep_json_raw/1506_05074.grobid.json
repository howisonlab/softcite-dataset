In the SM the branching ratio to the different leptons is the same since the decay proceeds via a W boson, but in models of new physics, e.g. supersymmetry (SUSY), final states with \u03c4 leptons can be enhanced or suppressed [5]; thus measuring the inclusive cross section using final states with \u03c4 leptons can be a good probe for new physics. The measured values of the top quark branching ratios will deviate with respect to the SM predictions if the data sample selected to extract tt events contains final states without two W bosons. Examples of processes that would cause deviations include events with a top quark decaying to charged Higgs boson or with SUSY particles decaying to the supersymmetric partner of the \u03c4 lepton (\u03c4). Limits on the top quark branching ratio to a charged Higgs boson and a b-quark have been published by the CDF [6], D0 [7,8], ATLAS [9,10] and CMS [11] collaborations. Another example of a final state that can change the observed branching ratios is the pair production of supersymmetric partners of the top quark (t) decaying into b\u03bd \u03c4\u03c4 followed by the\u03c4 decay into a \u03c4 lepton and the gravitino, predicted by gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models [12].",

The branching ratios can be more sensitive probes of deviations from SM expectations than measuring cross sections in different channels, because of cancellation of systematic uncertainties. The large number of tt pairs produced at the LHC provides an opportunity to measure top quark branching ratios with high precision. These top quark branching ratios are expected to be determined by the W boson branching ratios, which have been measured at LEP [13] to be in good agreement with the SM expectations [14]. Observing any deviation would be an indication of non-SM processes contributing to final states dominated by tt production. This article also presents a measurement of the inclusive tt cross section using events with an isolated charged lepton (\u03bc or e) and a \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically (\u03c4 had ). Previous measurements of the cross section at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV in this channel have been published by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [15,16]. The analysis uses the full data sample, 4.6 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV between March and November 2011. Kinematic selection criteria are applied that require one or both of the top and antitop quarks to decay into a final state with one isolated lepton and a jet. At least one jet in the event must be tagged as originating from a b-quark (b-tag). Seven mutually exclusive final states are used in this analysis: e \u00fe jets, \u03bc \u00fe jets, ee \u00fe jets, \u03bc\u03bc \u00fe jets, e\u03bc \u00fe jets, e\u03c4 had \u00fe jets and \u03bc\u03c4 had \u00fe jets. Branching ratios for semileptonic and purely hadronic top quark decays are obtained by combining these seven final states assuming that only SM processes contribute to the background and the top branching ratios to leptons and jets add up to one.",

In every event, either an electron or a muon is required, with the aim to select W \u2192 l\u03bd, where l stands for either e or \u03bc. The l may be produced directly in W \u2192 l\u03bd boson decays or indirectly in W \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd decays. Separate event channels are classified depending on the decay of a second W boson: W \u2192 jets for l \u00fe jets, W \u2192 l\u03bd for ll 0 \u00fe jets, or W \u2192 \u03c4 had \u03bd for l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets. Since the analysis does not distinguish electrons or muons that originate from a \u03c4 lepton decay from those that come from direct W \u2192 e\u03bd and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decays, both are included in the W \u2192 l\u03bd decays. The branching ratios are measured by taking ratios of the number of tt events extracted from the three channels; thus an important aspect of the event selection is to use similar criteria for the object selection in all final states, so as to allow the cancellation of systematic uncertainties in the ratios. Another important criterion is to ensure that no event contributes to more than one channel. The channel with the largest background and smallest number of signal events is that containing l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets; thus the event selection and analysis were optimized to reduce the uncertainty in that channel (see Sec. V).",

The template shapes are fixed while their normalizations are allowed to vary. The signal templates are derived from tt Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, which assumes that the top quark decays to a W boson and a b-quark with a 100% branching ratio. This assumption affects the shape of the signal templates, and if it is not valid for the selected data, the measured branching ratios will deviate from the SM prediction. The amount of background varies significantly in each channel. It is almost negligible in the e\u03bc \u00fe jets channel and larger than the signal in the l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets channels. In the l \u00fe jets channels, three invariant masses from two-and three-jet systems and a transverse mass distribution are fitted, as described in detail in Sec. VI, while in the ll 0 \u00fe jets channels the dilepton effective mass distributions from two different missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) regions are used (see Sec. VII). Because of the much larger background, which originates from jets misidentified as \u03c4 leptons, a very different approach is taken in the l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets channel. Instead of fitting a kinematic distribution, the quantity fitted is a boosted decision tree (BDT) output [17], a multivariate discriminant that separates jets from \u03c4 leptons decaying to hadrons (see Sec. VIII).",

BDT e is a BDT trained to distinguish electrons and \u03c4 leptons using a Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 MC sample as signal and a Z \u2192 ll MC sample as background. The BDT e uses four variables; the two most powerful being the ratio of high-threshold to low-threshold track hits in the transition radiator and the ratio of energy deposited in the EM calorimeter to the total energy deposited in the calorimeter. The medium working point corresponds to 85% efficiency for Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, Ref. [43]. The additional rejection factor for electrons after removing isolated electrons that overlap with \u03c4 candidates is 60. In addition, a muon veto that compares the track momentum in \u03c4 candidates with the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is required to further reduce the muon background. It is tuned to 96% efficiency on signal (62% on background after overlap removal).

The minimum number of jets with p T > 25 GeV is raised to four. Events with \u03c4 candidates are removed. Removing events with \u03c4 candidates from the l \u00fe jets channel results in an efficiency loss of 8.5%.

There are also smaller contributions from single top, Z\u00f0\u2192 ll\u00de \u00fe jets (with one lepton not identified) and multijet processes with one jet misidentified as a lepton. Background templates are derived from the MC simulations in all cases except multijet processes. The multijet background is very difficult to simulate due to the need for a very large sample and the fact that MC models do not reproduce that background well. Instead it is derived from a control data sample with nonisolated electrons and muons, keeping all other selection criteria the same. The distributions of a small expected contribution from tt is subtracted from the multijet control sample. Figure 1 shows the m jj , m b1jj , m b2jj and m T distributions predicted by MC simulation and normalized to unity for W \u00fe jets, Z \u00fe jets, and tt \u2192 l \u00fe jets events. It also shows these distributions for multijet events derived from the control data sample. The distributions from other tt channels are not shown as that background is normalized following the MC prediction of the ratio to the number of tt \u2192 l \u00fe jets events. The figure demonstrates that the shape of all the invariant mass distributions from jets are quite distinct for tt \u2192 l \u00fe jets while there is very little difference between the various backgrounds. The distributions for tt \u2192 l \u00fe jets events show that they include top quarks decaying to b \u00fe W with the W boson decaying to jets. On the other hand, the m T distributions show that they include a W boson decaying leptonically in both the tt \u2192 l \u00fe jets and W \u00fe jets channels but cannot discriminate between them. They do show a clear separation between final states with one W boson decaying leptonically and those with little intrinsic E miss T (Z \u00fe jets and multijets). The background templates for Z \u00fe jets events from MC simulation are checked with Z \u00fe jets events from data by selecting events with two identified leptons and requiring the dilepton mass to be near the Z mass. Events are required to have two oppositely charged leptons (p e T > 25 GeV and p \u03bc T > 20 GeV), 70GeV<m ll <110GeV, E miss T >30 GeV, and the same jet selections as for the l \u00fe jets signal. The only significant background in the control data sample is from the tt \u2192 ll 0 \u00fe jets channel. Figure 2 shows the m jj , m b1jj and m b2jj distributions after merging ee and \u03bc\u03bc events for ALPGEN Z \u00fe jets MC simulation and the data after applying scale factors (SF) based on comparing data and simulation as a function of the Z boson p T and the jet multiplicity. The small expected tt contribution is subtracted from the data distributions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test (KS) value in each plot indicates how well the shape of the data distribution is described by the ALPGEN MC simulation. 4 Since there is no noticeable difference between the shapes of the W \u00fe jets and Z \u00fe jets templates, as shown in Fig. 1, one can conclude that both MC templates can reproduce reasonably well the distributions expected in the data. The number of selected Z \u00fe jets events is also predicted well by the simulation.",

The only distribution that is different for each background is the transverse mass. In particular, the transverse mass clearly distinguishes final states with intrinsic E miss T , i.e. those with a W boson decaying to a lepton and neutrino, from those where E miss T is due to mismeasurements. The dominant processes without sizeable intrinsic E miss T are multijet and Z \u00fe jets. The transverse mass distributions for those two processes are different. However, they contribute little in m T > 40 GeV so most of the separation comes from the region below 40 GeV. As shown in Fig. 2, the ALPGEN Z \u00fe jets simulation predicts the shape and the number of Z \u00fe jets events well, so the choice is made to normalize the number of Z \u00fe jets events to that predicted by the simulation. The number of single top events is similarly normalized from MC simulation. The amount of multijet background is obtained from the fit to the data using the templates derived from nonisolated lepton samples. The other free parameters are the total number of W \u00fe jets events and the total number of tt events. The fractional contributions for the various tt channels are obtained using MC events. To ensure that events are not used more than once, two sets of data are fitted: E miss T < 30 GeV (set 1) and E miss T > 30 GeV (set 2). Set 1 is used to fit the m T distributions and helps determine the multijet background. Set 2 is used to fit the three jet mass distributions. Both sets are fit simultaneously with three parameters: the total number of multijet events, the total number of W \u00fe jets events and the total number of tt events.",

Since the E miss T distribution falls more rapidly for the Z \u00fe jets background than for the tt signal process separating it into two E miss T bins improves the sensitivity of the fit for separating the two processes. Backgrounds from dibosons and jets misidentified as isolated leptons (mainly from W \u00fe jets with leptons from heavy-quark semileptonic decays or an isolated charged hadron misidentified as a lepton, together denoted as nonprompt leptons) amount to 1.0% of the events. The background from nonprompt isolated leptons is estimated from the number of data events with lepton pairs with the same charge after subtracting a very small expected contribution from diboson processes. The invariant mass distributions are fitted with three templates: one derived from a tt MC sample, one from a Z \u00fe jets MC sample, and one summed over all other contributions. Only the amounts contributed by tt and Z \u00fe jets are allowed to vary.

The W \u00fe 1-jet sample is rich in jets originating from quark hadronization (quark jets) while the W \u00fe 2-jets sample has a high percentage of jets originating from gluon hadronization (gluon jets) as determined from MC studies. One can extract the distributions of gluon jets misidentified as \u03c4 candidates since the number of gluon jets in OS and SS samples must be the same because they are not correlated with the charge of the lepton. Fake \u03c4 template shapes depend on the jet type. Those from light-quark jets peak at higher BDT j values than those from gluon jets. The signal contributes only to OS events. Therefore, the BDT j distributions of OS events are fitted with a pair of background templates, whose linear combination equals the sum of the OS light-quark and gluon jets identified as \u03c4 candidates, and a signal \u03c4 template. MC studies show that requiring \u03c4 candidates that have only one associated charged particle strongly suppresses jets originating from heavy quarks (c-jets, b-jets). The b-jets are further suppressed by excluding \u03c4 candidates that are tagged as b-jets. The BDT j template from remaining c-jets identified as \u03c4 candidates is similar to the light-quark template.

The generator uncertainty is evaluated by comparing the MC@NLO and ALPGEN [29] predictions with those of POWHEG [20] interfaced to either HERWIG or PYTHIA. The PDF uncertainty is evaluated following the PDF4LHC recommendation [45]. An event-by-event weighting is applied to a default MC@NLO sample that uses the central value of CT10 [28]. MSTW2008 [46] and NNPDF2.0 [47,48] sets are taken to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the PDF. The uncertainty due to ISR/FSR is evaluated using the ALPGEN generator interfaced to the PYTHIA shower model, and by varying the parameters controlling ISR and FSR in a range consistent with experimental data [49]. The dominant uncertainty in this category of systematic uncertainties is the modeling of ISR/FSR. In addition there is an uncertainty in the W \u00fe jets MC simulation due to the uncertainty in the heavy-flavor component of the jets.

This measurement differs from the earlier one in that it uses only \u03c4s decaying into one charged hadron and a different background model to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the branching ratios. The results from combining all channels to extract the top quark branching ratios are given in Table IX. The measured cross   TABLE VII. Absolute systematic uncertainties, in pb, for the cross-section measurements with the tt \u2192 l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets channel. The e and \u03bc uncertainties are the sum in quadrature of trigger, reconstruction and selection efficiency uncertainties. The \u03c4 identification uncertainty includes electrons misidentified as \u03c4 leptons. section of 178 AE 17 pb is in good agreement with those obtained by ATLAS for individual channels [52][53][54]. The selection criteria for this measurement were optimized for the tt \u2192 l\u03c4 had \u00fe jets channel, which has the largest uncertainty, and then applied uniformly to all channels, ensuring no event overlap between them to exploit cancellation of systematic uncertainties in the ratios. This reduces the systematic uncertainties in the branching ratio measurements but it is not optimal for a cross-section measurement combining all channels. The systematic uncertainty on the inclusive cross section obtained by combining the samples used for this measurement is larger than the best ATLAS inclusive cross-section measurement [54], which achieved much smaller uncertainties because it was designed to minimize the systematic uncertainties related to jets, including the b-tagging efficiency and the jet energy scale. All cross-section measurements are in good agreement with the NNLO \u00fe NNLL theoretical prediction 177.3 AE 9.0 \u00fe4.6 \u22126.0 pb (calculated for a top mass of 172.5 GeV [24,55]). The branching ratios into leptons and jets are in good agreement with the SM prediction that the top quark decays 100% to W \u00fe quark. The precision of the measurements ranges from 2.3% for B j to 7.6% for B \u03c4 . The B e and B \u03bc include the leptonic decay of \u03c4 leptons while B \u03c4 includes only the hadronic decays of \u03c4 leptons. There is no evidence for any non-SM top quark decay or for any non-SM process contribution that could affect these measurements. For example, the measured branching ratio B \u03c4 will vary by more than the observed uncertainty if the branching rati\u00f5 t \u2192 b\u03bd \u03c4\u03c4 times thett production cross section (\u03c3~t~\u00aft) is greater than 3% of \u03c3 tt . The predicted \u03c3~t~\u00aft depends ont mass (m~t); it is equal to \u03c3 tt for m~t \u00bc 120 GeV and 12% of \u03c3 tt for m~t \u00bc 180 GeV [56].",

These are in agreement with all other cross-section measurements obtained by ATLAS and CMS. All cross-section measurements are fully compatible with the NNLO \u00fe NNLL theoretical prediction. Top quark branching ratios have also been measured and found to be in good agreement with branching ratios predicted by the SM. The precision ranges from 2.3% for the decays to jets to 7.6% for the decays to \u03c4\u03bd \u00fe jet. There is no evidence for any non-SM process affecting these branching ratios.",
