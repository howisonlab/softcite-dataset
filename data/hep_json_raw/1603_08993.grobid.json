The relatively large value of r B (about 0.1) in B \u2212 \u2192 D K \u2212 decays means that the relative phase of the two interfering amplitudes can be obtained.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.5 GeV. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices. At least one charged particle must have transverse momentum p T > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [21] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

This mass range corresponds to approximately three times the mass resolution of the signal peaks. The kaon or pion originating from the B \u00b1 decay, subsequently referred to as the bachelor particle, is required to have p T in the range 0.5-10.0 GeV/c and p in the range 5-100 GeV/c. These requirements ensure that the track is within the kinematic coverage of the RICH detectors, which are used to provide particle identification (PID) information. Details of the PID calibration procedure are given in Sect. 4. In addition, a kinematic fit is performed to each decay chain, with vertex constraints applied to both the B \u00b1 and D vertices, and the D candidate constrained to its known mass [29]. Events are required to have been triggered by either the decay products of the signal candidate or particles produced elsewhere in the pp collision.

The distribution of each of these sources in the invariant mass spectrum depends on the spin and mass of the missing particle. If the missing particle has spin-parity 0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 ), the distribution is parameterised by a parabola with positive (negative) curvature convolved with a Gaussian resolution function. The kinematics of the decay that produced the missing particle define the endpoints of the range of the parabola. Decays in which both a particle is missed and a bachelor pion is misidentified as a kaon are parameterised with a semi-empirical PDF, formed from the sum of Gaussian and error functions. The parameters of each partially reconstructed PDF are fixed to the values found in fits to simulated events, and are varied as a source of systematic uncertainty. The yields of each contribution vary independently in each subsample, where all partially reconstructed decay modes share a common effective charge asymmetry across all D modes. Though its effect is mitigated by the limited range of the mass fit, large CP violation in the low-mass background is possible in the GLW and ADS samples, so a systematic uncertainty is assigned.",

The shaded part indicates partially reconstructed decays, the dotted line, where visible, shows the combinatorial component, and the total PDF is drawn as a thin blue line.

Measurements exploiting the four-pion D decay are reported for the first time with theB \u2212 \u2192 [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] D K \u2212 decayshowing an indication of CP violation at the 2.7 \u03c3 level. The charge asymmetry in this mode is positive, similar to the classic GLW modes, B \u2212 \u2192 [K + K \u2212 ] D K \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192 [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] D K \u2212 , in line with expectation for a multi-body D mode with a CP fraction greater than 0.5 [15]. A comparison with SM expectation is made by calculating the CP observables from current best-fit values of \u03b3 = (73.2 +6.3 \u22127.0 ) \u2022 as well as \u03b4 B = (125.4 +7.0 \u22127.8 ) \u2022 and r B = (9.70 +0.62 \u22120.63 )% for B \u00b1 \u2192 D K \u00b1 decays [2]. For B \u00b1 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u00b1 decays, where no independent information on r B and \u03b4 B is available, uniform PDFs are used, 180 \u2022 < \u03b4 B < 360 \u2022 and 0.004 < r B < 0.008. The D-decay parameters are taken from the literature: r = (0.349 \u00b1 0.004)% and \u03b4 D = (191.8 + 9.5 \u221214.7 ) \u2022 [35]; F 4\u03c0 + = 0.737 \u00b1 0.028 [15]; r K 3\u03c0 D = (5.52 \u00b1 0.007)%, \u03b4 K 3\u03c0 D = (170 +37 \u221239 ) \u2022 and \u03ba K 3\u03c0 D = 0.32 +0.12 \u22120.08[11]. The current world averages of the D-mixing parameters are x = (0.37 \u00b1 0.16)% and y = (0.66+0.07    \u22120.10 )%[35], and the \u03b1 coefficients reported in Sec. 6are used for the small D-mixing correction. For these inputs, the central 68% confidence-level expectation interval is displayed inFig. 8, together with the results presented herein. It is seen that the B \u2212 \u2192 D K \u2212 measurements are compatible with expectation and that the improvement in the knowledge of the A ADS observables is particularly significant. The measurements presented in this paper improve many of the CP observables used in global fits for the unitarity triangle angle \u03b3 as well as the hadronic parameters r B and \u03b4 B for these decays. An improvement in the global best-fit precision on \u03b3 of around 15% is anticipated from this work.",
