We employed an ultra-sensitive low-field magnetometer based on the detection of free precession of co-located 3 He and 129 Xe nuclear spins using SQUIDs as low-noise magnetic flux detectors. The precession frequency shift in the presence of an unpolarized mass was measured to determine the coupling of pseudoscalar particles to the spin of the bound neutron. For boson masses between 2 \u00b5eV and 500 \u00b5eV (force ranges between 3\u202210 \u22124 m -10 \u22121 m) we improved the laboratory upper bounds by up to 4 orders of magnitude.",

They could have been created in early stages of the Universe being attractive candidates to the cold dark matter that could compose up to \u223c1/3 of the ingredients of the Universe [2]. Several constraints from astrophysics, cosmology, and laboratory experiments have been applied in order to prove or rule out the existence of the axion, i.e., constrain the axions mass m a and/or its couplings. The mass range, in which axions are still likely to exist, could thus be narrowed down to a window reaching from \u00b5eV [3] up to some meV [4] (axion window). Most axion searches look for the conversion of an axion of galactic [5], solar [6], or laboratory [7] origin into a photon in the presence of a static magnetic field. However, any axion or axion-like particle that couples with both scalar and pseudoscalar vertices to fundamental fermions would also mediate a parity and time-reversal symmetryviolating force between a fermion f and the spin of another fermion f \u03c3 , which is parameterized by a Yukawatype potential with range \u03bb and a monopole-dipole coupling given by [8]:",

A second square coil pair (B y -coils) arranged perpendicular to the B x -coils was used to manipulate the sample spins, e.g., \u03c0/2 spin flip by non-adiabatic switching [11]. The major components of the experimental setup within BMSR-2 are shown in Fig. 1. For the detection of spin precession we used a multi-channel low-T c DC-SQUID device [16,17]. The 3 He/ 129 Xe nuclear spins were polarized outside the shielding by means of optical pumping. Low-relaxation cylindrical glass cells (GE180) were filled with the polarized gases and placed directly beneath the dewar as close as possible to the SQUID sensors. The SQUID sensors detect a sinusoidal change in magnetic flux due to the nuclear spin precession of the gas atoms. In order to obtain a high common mode rejection ratio, three first order gradiometric sensor combinations were used in order to suppress environmental disturbance fields like vibrational modes. Fig. 1 shows their positions with respect to each other and with respect to the 3 He/ 129 Xe sample cell. The system noise of the SQUID gradiometer configurations was between 3 fT/ \u221a Hz and 10 fT/ \u221a Hz in the range of the 3 He/ 129 Xe spin-precession frequencies, i.e., 4 Hz < \u03bd L < 12 Hz, while typical signal amplitudes reached 10 pT for helium and 3 pT for xenon at the beginning of the spin precession cycle.

Two effects caused by a non-zero magnetic susceptibility of the BGO have to be considered, by taking \u03c7 mag = \u221219 ppm which is the high field limit (B > 0.1 T) [21]. a.) The BGO at \"close\" position slightly changes the magnetic field across the volume of the 3 He/ 129 Xe sample cell. This effect drops out to first order due to comagnetometry. To second order , however, the difference in their molar masses leads to a difference (\u2206z) in their center of masses (barometric formula) which is \u2206z = 1.2\u202210 \u22127 m for our cylindrical sample cell. This results in a frequency shift of \u2206\u03bd sys = \u2206z \u2022 | \u2202B/\u2202z | ind \u2022 \u03b3 He /2\u03c0 \u2264 0.03 nHz for induced field gradients in the vertical direction of | \u2202B/\u2202z | ind \u2264 0.08 pT/cm. The field gradients were calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics, a finite element analysis software. Compared to the measured frequency shift (Eq. 10), this systematic effect is negligible. b.) More serious is the fact that a change of the magnetic field gradient by the BGO also influences the T * 2times of 3 He and 129 Xe. The direct approach is to extract T * 2 and thus \u2206T * 2 via the exponential decay of the signal amplitudes with the BGO in \"close\" and \"distant\" position.
