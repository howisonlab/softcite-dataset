An \u03c9J/\u03c8 mass peak with similar mass and width was seen in the two-photon fusion process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8, again by both Belle [5] and BaBar [6] (see Fig. 1b); BaBar reported its J PC to be 0 ++ . The similar masses and widths of the peaks seen in the two production modes suggest that these are being produced a single state (i.e., the X(3915)). The Particle Data Group's (PDG) average values for the mass and width measurements from both production channels are [7]: M(X(3915)) = 3918.4 \u00b1 1.9 MeV and \u0393(X(3915)) = 20.0 \u00b1 5.0 MeV, (1) and the product branching fraction for X(3915) production in B + meson decays is",

The important angles for distinguishing J = 2 + from J = 0 \u00b1 are \u03b8 * n , the angle between n, the normal to the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay plane, and the \u03b3\u03b3 axis in the omega rest frame, and \u03b8 ln , the angle between n and the direction of the + from J/\u03c8 \u2192 + \u2212 decay (see Fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows the BaBar cos \u03b8 * n distribution together with the expectation for J = 0 \u00b1 as a solid red line and J = 2 + as a dashed blue curve. There is a strong \u03c7 2 penalty for the near-zero event likelihood near cos \u03b8 * n = \u00b11 for the J = 2 + hypothesis to fluctuate upward to the observed levels of \u223c 8 and \u223c 9 events, and this is the main support BaBar's J = 0 conclusion. The J = 2 hypothesis seems to fit the BaBar cos \u03b8 ln distribution (see Fig. 2c) better than that for J = 0. But in this case, the likelihood of \u223c 6 expected events near cos \u03b8 ln = \u00b11 to fluctuate downward to the observed 2 events is not so improbable. With J = 0 established, the 0 + vs. 0 \u2212 discrimination mostly relies on the angle \u03b8 n , which is the angle between the \u03c9's flight path and n in the \u03c9J/\u03c8 restframe. The BaBar cos \u03b8 n distribution shown in Fig. 2d favors 0 + over 0 \u2212 , mostly because of the 10 events near cos \u03b8 n = +1, where the 0 \u2212 expectation is zero.",

This assumption of \"helicity-2 dominance\" originate from a theoretical analysis that found that in two-photon production of tensor mesons, the helicity-0 component (h 0 ) is zero in the non-relativistic limit [15]. The authors of ref. [16] point out that in the case of charmonium, the suppression of helicity-0 contributions only applies to mesons that are 100% cc, which is generally considered to be unlikely for charmonium mesons with masses above the 2m D open-charm threshold (see, e.g., ref. [17]).",

The dashed lines in Fig. 4a show the ref. [16] comparison of the Belle M(DD) and | cos \u03b8| with an h 0 1.5h 2 mixture to represent the X(3915). Figure 4b) shows BaBar's cos \u03b8 * n and cos \u03b8 ln distributions with expectations for 0 ++ , and 2 ++ with h = 0 & h = 2. With the inclusion of some h = 0 contribution, the \u03c7 2 distinction between 0 ++ and 2 ++ angular distributions is diminished and the authors conclude that the X(3915) could be a \u03c7 c2 state that contains a sizable non-cc component.  In addition to violating helicity-2 dominance, which ref. [16] claims may not be a problem, there are other concerns with the X(3915) = \u03c7 c2 assignment. These are briefly discussed here.",

The inferred branching fraction, B(B + \u2192 K + \u03c7 c2 ) = 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , is smaller that the product branching fraction for X(3915) \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8 production in B + meson decays (eqn. 2). Since B(\u03c7 c2 \u2192 DD) cannot exceed unity, eqn. 6 implies B(\u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8) < 0.08 (90% CL). Thus, if the X(3915) produced in B \u2192 K\u03c9J/\u03c8 is the \u03c7 c2 , the B-meson decay width to K + \u03c7 c2 would be more than an order of magnitude larger than that to K + \u03c7 c2 . This contradicts theoretical expectations that B \u2192 K[cc] decay widths decrease with increasing radial [cc] quantum numbers [22]. Suppression of B \u2192 K\u03c7 ( ) c2 is not unexpected. The primary mechanism for B-meson (bq) decays to K[cc] final states isb \u2192c plus a virtual W + that, in turn, materializes as cs. The final-state c-andc-quark form the [cc] state and thes-and \"spectator\" q-quark form the K. This process is only allowed for J PC = 0 \u2212+ , 1 \u2212\u2212 and 1 ++ [cc] states, decays to [cc] states with other J PC values are higher-order and expected to be \"factorization suppressed\" [23]. The Belle results on B \u2192 K\u03c7 c2 shown in Fig. 5c demonstrate that for J PC = 2 ++ [cc] states, factorization suppression is very effective: B(B \u2192 K\u03c7 c2 ) < 0.04 \u00d7 B(B \u2192 K\u03c7 c1 ) (90% CL).",

While a (tenuous) case could be made that the near-3925 MeV mass peaks seen by the LHCb in pp \u2192 DDX, Belle and BaBar in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8 & DD and BESIII in Y(4220) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9J/\u03c8 are all due to decays of the \u03c7 c2 , the existing evidence is not conclusive. Moreover, a very strong case can be made against a \u03c7 c2 interpretation of the \u03c9J/\u03c8 peak seen in B \u2192 K\u03c9J/\u03c8 decays.",

The LHCb group has demonstrated that they can isolate clean B + \u2192 K + \u03c9J/\u03c8 signals with good efficiency [28] and I look forward to high-statistics results from them in the near future.",
