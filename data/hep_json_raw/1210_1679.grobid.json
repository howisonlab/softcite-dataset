            "text": "SUSY searches in collider experiments typically focus on events with high transverse missing energy (E miss T ) which can arise from (weakly interacting) Lightest Supersymmetric Particles (LSPs), in the case of R-parity conserving SUSY, or from neutrinos produced in LSP decays, when R-parity is broken. Hence, the event selection criteria of inclusive channels are based on large E miss T , no or few leptons (e, \u03bc), many jets and/or b-jets, \u03c4-leptons and photons. The exact sets of cuts (\"signal regions\", SRs) are a compromise between the necessity to suppress events coming from known SM processes while maintaining sufficient number of surviving SUSY events. Typical SM backgrounds are top-quark production -including single-top-, W/Z in association with jets, dibosons and QCD multi-jet events. These are estimated using semi-or fully data-driven techniques. Although the various analyses are motivated and optimised for a specific SUSY scenario, the interpretation of the results are extended to various SUSY models or topologies.",

Various channels fall into this class of searches; here two cases are highlighted: the 0-lepton plus jets plus E miss T and the lepton(s) plus jets plus E miss T . In the 0-lepton search [4], events are selected based on a jet+E miss T trigger, applying a lepton veto, requiring a minimum number of jets (two to six), E miss T > 160 GeV, and large azimuthal separation between the E miss T and reconstructed jets, in order to reject multi-jet background. Events are analysed in five SRs based on jet multiplicity, which are further divided to an overall of eleven channels by using different m eff (incl.) thresholds. The latter variable is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of jets with p T > 40 GeV plus the E miss T . The most important sources of background are estimated with data-driven methods, by using measurements in control regions (CRs) and Monte Carlo (MC) predictions for SRs and CRs, applying similar techniques as for the one/two-leptons search described below. The m eff (incl.) distributions for data, for various background processes before and after fitting to CR observations and for two MSUGRA/CMSSM benchmark model points with m 0 = 500 GeV, m 1 /2 = 570 GeV, A 0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0 and with m 0 = 2500 GeV, m 1 /2 = 270 GeV, A 0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0 are shown in Fig. 1 (left).",
