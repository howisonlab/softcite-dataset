We observe \u03b7c decays to both final states and perform Dalitz plot analyses using a model-independent partial wave analysis technique. This allows a model-independent measurement of the mass-dependence of the I = 1/2 K\u03c0 S-wave amplitude and phase. A comparison between the present measurement and those from previous experiments indicates similar behaviour for the phase up to a mass of 1.5 GeV/c 2 . In contrast, the amplitudes show very marked differences. The data require the presence of a new a0(1950) resonance with parameters m = 1931 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 22 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 271 \u00b1 22 \u00b1 29 MeV.",

            "text": "Scalar mesons are still a puzzle in light meson spectroscopy: they have complex structure, and there are too many states to be accommodated within the quark model without difficulty [1]. In particular, the structure of the I = 1/2 K\u03c0 S-wave is a longstanding problem. In recent years many experiments have performed accurate studies of the decays of heavy-flavored hadrons producing a K\u03c0 system in the final state. These studies include searches for CP violation [2], and searches for, and observation of, new exotic resonances [3] and charmed mesons [4]. However, the still poorly known structure of the I = 1/2 K\u03c0 S-wave is a source of large systematic uncertainties. The best source of information on the scalar structure of the K\u03c0 system comes from the LASS experiment, which studied the reaction K \u2212 p\u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + n [5]. Partial wave analysis of the K\u03c0 system reveals a large contribution from the I = 1/2 K\u03c0 S-wave amplitude over the mass range studied. In the description of the I = 1/2 scalar amplitude up to a K\u03c0 mass of about 1.5 GeV/c 2 the K * 0 (1430) resonant amplitude is added coherently to an effective-range description in such a way that the net amplitude actually decreases rapidly at the resonance mass. The I = 1/2 S-wave amplitude representation is given explicitly in Ref. [6]. In the LASS analysis, in the region above 1.82 GeV/c 2 , the S-wave suffers from a two-fold ambiguity, but in both solutions it is understood in terms of the presence of a K * 0 (1950) resonance. It should be noted that the extraction of the I = 1/2 S-wave amplitude is complicated by the presence of an I = 3/2 contribution.",

Using the same data, a Model Independent Partial Wave Analysis (MIPWA) of the K\u03c0 system was developed for the first time [8]. This method allows the amplitude and phase of the K\u03c0 S-wave to be extracted as functions of mass (see also Refs. [9] and [10]). However in these analyses the phase space is limited to mass values less than 1.6 GeV/c 2 due to the kinematical limit imposed by the D + mass. A similar method has been used to extract the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave amplitude in a Dalitz plot analysis of D + s \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + [11].

The BABAR experiment first performed a Dalitz plot analysis of \u03b7 c \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 c \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03b7 using an isobar model [12]. The analysis reported the first observation of K * 0 (1430)\u2192K\u03b7, and observed that \u03b7 c decays to three pseudoscalars are dominated by intermediate scalar mesons. A previous search for charmonium resonances decaying to K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 in two-photon interactions is reported in Ref. [13]. We continue these studies of \u03b7 c decays and extract the K\u03c0 S-wave amplitude by performing a MIPWA of both \u03b7 c \u2192K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and \u03b7 c \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 final states.",

The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [16]. Charged particles are detected, and their momenta are measured, by means of a fivelayer, double-sided microstrip detector, and a 40-layer drift chamber, both operating in the 1.5 T magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. Photons are measured and electrons are identified in a CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter. Charged-particle identification is provided by the measurement of specific energy loss in the tracking devices, and by an internally reflecting, ring-imaging Cherenkov detector. Muons and K 0 L mesons are detected in the instrumented flux return of the magnet. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events [17], with reconstructed sample sizes more than 10 times larger than the corresponding data samples, are used to evaluate the signal efficiency and to determine background features.

Figure 1 shows the measured p T distribution in comparison to the corresponding p T distribution obtained from simulation of the signal process. A peak at low p T is observed indicating the presence of the two-photon process. The shape of the peak agrees well with that seen in the MC simulation. Figure 2 shows the K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 mass spectrum in the \u03b7 c mass region. A clear \u03b7 c signal over a background of about 35% can be seen, together with a residual J/\u03c8 signal. Information on the fitting procedure is given at the end of Sec. IV. We define the \u03b7 c signal region as the range 2.922-3.039 GeV/c 2 (m(\u03b7 c ) \u00b1 1.5 \u0393), which contains 12849 events with a purity of (64.3 \u00b1 0.4)% . Sideband regions are defined by the ranges 2.785-2.844 GeV/c 2 and 3.117-3.175 GeV/c 2 (within 3.5-5 \u0393), respectively as indicated (shaded) in Details on data selection, event reconstruction, resolution, and efficiency measurement for the \u03b7 c \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay can be found in Ref.

Due to the presence of long tails in the Breit-Wigner (BW) representation of the resonance, we apply selection criteria to restrict the generated events to the \u03b7 c mass region. We express the efficiency as a function of the invariant mass, m(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [21], and cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle, in the K + \u03c0 \u2212 rest frame, between the directions of the K + and the boost from the K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 rest frame.

We plot only the first part of the LASS measurement since it suffers from a two-fold ambiguity above the mass of 1.82 GeV/c 2 . The Dalitz plot fits extract invariant amplitudes. Consequently, in Fig. 14(a), the LASS I = 1/2 K\u03c0 scattering amplitude values have been multiplied by the factor m(K\u03c0)/q to convert to invariant amplitude, and normalized so as to equal the scattering amplitude at 1.5 GeV/c 2 in order to facilitate comparison to the \u03b7 c results. Here q is the momentum of either meson in the K\u03c0 rest frame. For better compar-ison, the LASS absolute phase measurements have been displaced by \u22120.6 rad before plotting them in Fig. 14(c). In Fig. 14(b) the E791 amplitude has been obtained by multiplying the amplitude c in Table III of Ref.

This yields amplitude values corresponding to the E791 Form Factor having value 1, as for the \u03b7 c analyses.

The K\u03c0 S-wave is dominated by the presence of the K * 0 (1430) resonance which is observed as a clear peak with the corresponding increase in phase of about \u03c0 expected for a resonance. A broad structure in the 1.95 GeV/c 2 mass region indicates the presence of the K * 0 (1950) resonance. A comparison between the present measurement and previous experiments indicates a similar trend for the phase up to a mass of 1.5 GeV/c 2 . The amplitudes, on the other hand, show very marked differences.  To fit the data we need to introduce a new a 0 (1950) resonance in both \u03b7 c \u2192K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and \u03b7 c \u2192K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay modes, and their associated parameter values are in good agreement. The weighted averages for the parameter values are: m(a 0 (1950)) = 1931 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 22 MeV/c 2 , \u0393(a 0 (1950)) = 271 \u00b1 22 \u00b1 29 MeV (12) with significances of 2.5\u03c3 and 4.2\u03c3 respectively, including systematic uncertainties. These results are, however, systematically limited, and more detailed studies of the I = 1 KK S-wave will be required in order to improve the precision of these values.",

Since the width of the \u03b7 c meson is 32.3 \u00b1 1.0 MeV, no mass constraint can be applied.The Dalitz plot is dominated by the presence of horizontal and vertical uniform bands at the position of the K * 0 (1430) resonance. We also observe further bands along the diagonal. Isospin conservation in \u03b7 c decay requires that the (KK) system have I=1, so that these structures may indicate the presence of a 0 or a 2 resonances. Further narrow bands are observed at the position of the K * (892) resonance, mostly in the K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 projection; these components are consistent with originating from background, as will be shown.The presence of background in the \u03b7 c signal region requires precise study of its structure. This can be achieved by means of the data in the \u03b7 c sideband regions, for which the Dalitz plots are shown inFig. 6.In both regions we observe almost uniformly populated resonant structures mostly in the K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 mass, especially in the regions corresponding to the K * (892) and K * 2 (1430) resonances. The resonant structures in K + \u03c0 \u2212 mass are weaker. The three-body decay of a pseudoscalar meson into a spin-one or spin-two resonance yields a nonuniform distribution (see Eq.(5)) in the relevant resonance band on the Dalitz plot. The presence of uniformly populated bands in the K * (892) and K * 2 (1430) mass regions, indicates that these structures are associated with",
