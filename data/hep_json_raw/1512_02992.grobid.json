            "text": "Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes are forbidden at tree level in the standard model (SM), although they can occur at higher orders. In contrast, there are several new physics (NP) models that allow FCNC even at tree level and can substantially enhance the branching fractions of the related decay processes. The decay of the neutral charm meson to two photons, D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, is one such example that constitutes a sensitive NP probe. Mediated by a c \u2192 u\u03b3\u03b3 transition, the amplitude for this rare decay has very small [O(10 \u221211 )] short-distance contributions [1][2][3] due to the small size of the bottom-quark mass relative to the weak scale and a low value of the quark-mixing matrix [4] element V ub . However, it is expected to have large long-distance contributions from intermediate vector mesons. Theory calculations based on vector meson dominance yield a decay branching fraction in the range (1-3) \u00d7 10 \u22128 [2,3,5]. Using the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the authors of Ref. [6] have predicted that the exchange of gluinos -the supersymmetric partners of gluons -can enhance the branching fraction up to 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . Furthermore, it has been suggested that, by measuring D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, one would be able to better identify potential NP contributions to D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [7].",

As the contribution of N B (t) is overwhelming, we neglect the a/2 term in the denominator of the original FOM expression in Ref. [18], where a is the desired CL in terms of standard deviations. We use signal MC events to estimate \u03b5 and a blended MC sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) and BB events to calculate N B . Some of the variables, notably E \u03b32 and A E , can have significant correlations among themselves. We take this effect into account via simultaneous optimizations of the criteria in these variables. To incorporate possible differences between data and simulations in the optimization procedure, we multiply N B in Eq. (2) by a correction factor estimated by comparing data and MC events in the sideband. The factor could be as large as 1.6, depending on the variable. The selection criteria obtained are p * (D * ) > 2.9 GeV/c, E \u03b32 > 900 MeV, A E < 0.5, P(\u03c0 0 ) < 0.15, and no requirement on P(\u03b7). We have verified that the same set of criteria can be applied to the combined sample of \u03a5 (4S) and \u03a5 (5S) data with the level of backgrounds being proportional to the respective luminosity.",

The exercise is repeated for various possible signal yields ranging from 0 to 100.

For a given signal yield, we generate 5000 sets of signal and background events according to their PDFs, and perform the fit. The CL is obtained by calculating the fraction of samples that gives a fit yield larger than that observed in data (4 events). The systematic uncertainty (described below) is accounted for in the limit calculation by smearing the fit yield. We obtain N 90% UL to be 25 events. As this is a relative measurement, most of the systematic uncertainties common between the signal and normalization channels cancel. However, some residual systematics remain. We estimate their contributions by varying the selection criteria that do not necessarily factor out. These include E \u03b32 , A E , and P(\u03c0 0 ). For E \u03b32 we estimate N/\u03b5 with and without any requirement on the photon energy in the D 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 control sample. The change with respect to the nominal value is taken as the corresponding systematic error. The uncertainty due to the P(\u03c0 0 ) requirement is calculated in the same control sample by comparing the nominal yield with the one obtained with a substantially relaxed criterion [P(\u03c0 0 ) < 0.7]. We double the above systematic uncertainties, as our signal has two photons.
