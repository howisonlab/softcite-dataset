In this approach, the new-physics model is constructed by expanding around the SM and integrating over degrees of freedom at higher energies. This leads to additional terms in the Lagrangian, proportional to inverse powers of the mass scale of the new particles, up to numerical factors that depend on the new couplings. We refer to the overall energy scale suppressing these terms as \u039b. In this paper we focus on possible additional contributions to the production of WW and WZ final states parametrized in such an EFT model by dimension-six operators [1,2], with the following CP-conserving modification to the SM Lagrangian: Figure 1.

These additional contributions induce triple gauge couplings (TGCs) beyond those present in the SM, and are referred to as anomalous TGCs (aTGCs). The SM behaviour is therefore recovered when c WWW = c W = c B = 0. Nonzero aTGCs would lead to increased WW and WZ production cross sections at high vector boson pair invariant masses. The search for nonzero aTGCs is performed in the semileptonic final state, with one W boson decaying to a lepton (e or \u00b5) and a neutrino, and the other W or Z boson decaying hadronically. The leading-order (LO) Feynman diagram for this process involving triple gauge couplings is shown in figure 1.",

            "text": "Although the hadronic decay channel of a gauge boson has a larger branching fraction than the leptonic decay channel, it suffers from the presence of background processes with significantly larger cross sections, especially those producing multiple hadronic jets. The semileptonic final state therefore offers a good balance between efficiency and purity. It also allows a full kinematic reconstruction of the diboson system, using the W mass to constrain the combined four-momentum of the lepton and neutrino. Since the effects of the aTGCs are most dramatic at high boson momenta, we consider only hadronic decays from highly Lorentz-boosted vector bosons where the hadronization products of the two final state quarks overlap in the detector to form a single, large-radius jet. This analysis distinguishes WW and WZ production using the invariant mass of the jet created as the result of the hadronic decay of the W/Z boson, thereby providing some discrimination between the different aTGC contributions. However, the relatively poor jet mass resolution significantly limits this separation power. Further discrimination between the different aTGC parameters is only possible by studying angular variables that characterize the JHEP12 (2019)062diboson production and decay products [3,4]. Such analysis is outside the scope of this search. To reduce contributions from the significant W+jets SM background processes, jet substructure techniques are used for the boson identification [5].",

The simulated signal processes include decays of the W boson to a tau lepton and neutrino, with the subsequent decay of the tau lepton to a muon or electron and the accompanying neutrino. The simulated signal events are first generated with all JHEP12(2019)062 three aTGC parameters set to nonzero positive values, and then reweighted to different permutations of zero and nonzero aTGCs using the matrix-element event weights computed by MadGraph5 amc@nlo. This includes the scenario where all aTGCs parameters are zero, corresponding to SM diboson production. The signal sample is rescaled such that the cross sections for diboson production in this scenario are normalized to the corresponding SM next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) cross sections [33,34] as described in section 5.",

Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions, increasing the apparent jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded prior to the clustering, and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions [65]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and in simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [65].

In this search, we apply a modified mass-drop algorithm [70,71], known as the soft drop algorithm [72], to the AK8 jet, with parameters \u03b2 = 0, z cut = 0.1, and R 0 = 0.8. This removes soft, wide-angle radiation from the jet, reducing the mass of jets initiated by gluons or single quarks, and improving the jet mass resolution for jets originating from heavy particles, here the W and Z bosons. To further improve the jet mass resolution, prior to grooming the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [73] is used to mitigate the effect of pileup at the reconstructed particle level, making use of local shape information, event pileup properties, and tracking information. Charged particles identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded. For each neutral particle, a local shape variable is computed using the surrounding charged particles that are compatible with the primary vertex and within the tracker acceptance (|\u03b7| < 2.5), and using both charged and neutral particles in the region outside of the tracker coverage. The momenta of the neutral particles are then scaled by the probability that they originate from the primary interaction vertex deduced from the local shape variable, superseding the need for jet-based pileup corrections [5]. The invariant mass of the resulting jet is the PUPPI soft drop mass m SD , one of the most important variables in this analysis.",

Finally, the aTGC-aTGC interference terms are derived by comparing samples with pairs of aTGCs set to nonzero values. The error function in the pure aTGC terms is introduced to accurately model the turn-on behaviour of the aTGC contributions.

All four regions are fitted simultaneously to constrain the shape parameters. In each region, the shape parameters describing the m WV distribution are constant with respect to m SD . In the sideband regions these shape parameters are determined by fitting to the data. In the signal regions the shape parameters are instead obtained by assuming that the simulation accurately describes the ratio of the m WV distributions in the signal and sideband regions. This ratio function \u03b1 MC (m WV ) is used to transfer the shape of the W+jets background, which comes from data, from the sideband to the signal regions, thereby encoding the dependence of m WV on m SD (the \u03b1 ratio method [75,76]). The total background contribution in the signal region, F SR bkg , can therefore be expressed as: 1) where F denotes the parametric functions representing various background contributions in the signal (SR) and sideband (SB) regions.

The limits derived in this analysis are the strictest bounds on all three parameters to date, improving upon the complementary all-leptonic searches also performed using collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS [23,24] and CMS [22] Collaborations.
