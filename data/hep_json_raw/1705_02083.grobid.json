            "text": "We measure the branching fraction and CP violation asymmetry in the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , using a data sample of 752 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider. The obtained branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry are B(B \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = [1.31 \u00b1 0.19 (stat.) \u00b1 0.19 (syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22126 and ACP = +0.14 \u00b1 0.36 (stat.) \u00b1 0.10 (syst.), respectively. The signal significance, including the systematic uncertainty, is 6.4 standard deviations. We combine these results with Belle's earlier measurements of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 to exclude the CP -violating parameter \u03c62 from the range 15.5 \u2022 < \u03c62 < 75.0 \u2022 at 95% confidence level. Extensive studies by the Belle, BaBar and LHCb ex-periments [1][2][3] have shown that the CP violation ob-served in nature can be attributed to a single irreducible phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, as proposed by Kobayashi and Maskawa [4]. The unitarity constraint of the CKM matrix, when applied to B mesons and plotted in the complex plane, results in a triangle with internal angles \u03c6 1 , \u03c6 2 , and \u03c6 3 [5]. Nonzero values for these angles imply CP violation in the B meson system. A main objective of the aforementioned experiments is to overconstrain the unitary triangle in order to precisely test the KM mechanism for CP violation as well as to search for new physics effects. One of the proposed techniques to measure \u03c6 2 is to perform an isospin analysis of the entire \u03c0\u03c0 system [6]. This requires measurements of branching fraction (B) and time-dependent CP asymmetry for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, for which Belle recently published precise measurements [7], together with measurements of B and the direct CP asymmetry (A CP ) for B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays [8]. Measurements of all these observables are required as electroweak tree and loop processes contribute with different phases to B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays and their effects must be disentangled to determine \u03c6 2 . Among the B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays, B and A CP for B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 are the least well determined. This decay is also important to probe the disagreement between quantumchromodynamics-based factorization, which predicts B below 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 [9,10], and previous measurements from Belle and BaBar of (1.8 -2.3) \u00d710 \u22126 [11,12].",

Due to the finite decaytime of the CsI(Tl) scintillation, significant residual light from such interactions could still be present in the ECL when a subsequent genuine hadronic interaction occurs. This \"pileup\" event resembles a hadronic event with high energy back-to-back photons in the CM frame, and thus passes the first-level trigger. When combined with random photons from the hadronic interaction, they appear as two \u03c0 0 's with a large invariant mass. Because the energy deposits are almost back-to-back in the CM system, their momentum sum is close to zero which causes the events to peak near the nominal B mass in M bc . Since the events are recorded in coincidence with hadronic interactions, they also mimic B-like events in the continuum suppression variable T c . A criterion on the trigger time of the CsI(Tl) crystals, which selects ECL inter-actions in-time with the rest of the event, is employed to suppress this background. Studies of a high-statistics control mode B 0 \u2192 D 0 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )\u03c0 0 , containing 1600 events, show that this requirement removes 99% of the pileup background at the cost of only 1% of signal.

The B 0 B 0 pair originating from the \u03a5(4S) are produced in a coherent quantum-mechanical state, from which one meson (B 0 rec ) may be reconstructed in the B \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay mode. The b-flavor of the other B meson (B 0 tag ) can be identified using information from the remaining charged particles and photons. This dictates the flavor of B 0 rec as it must be opposite that of the B 0 tag at the time B 0 tag decays. We follow the procedure described in Ref. [20] to the determine the b-flavor of B 0 tag . The tagging information is given by two parameters: the b-flavor charge q [+1 (\u22121) tagging a B 0 (B 0 )], and the purity for flavor charge r. The value of r is continuous and determined on an event-by-event basis with an algorithm trained on MC events, ranging from zero for no flavor discrimination to one for an unambiguous flavor assignment. To obtain a data-driven value for r, we divide its range into seven regions and determine the mistagging probability, w, for each region using a control sample [20]. The CP asymmetry in data is thus diluted by the factor (1 \u2212 2w). Since we do not determine the time between B 0 rec and B 0 tag , there is an additional dilution due to BB mixing, which is accounted for by a factor (1 \u2212 2\u03c7 d ), with \u03c7 d = 0.1875 \u00b1 0.0017 [16] being the time-integrated BB-mixing parameter.",

We compare the signal yield extracted from this off-resonance parameterization to that extracted when the parameterization is determined by fits to the signal region of MC simulations. These simulations are equivalent to six times the data recorded by the experiment.
