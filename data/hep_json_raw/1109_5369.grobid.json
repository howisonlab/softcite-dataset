Cross section measurements in pp collisions are essential for the ALICE physics program: particle production in heavy-ion (A-A) collisions is often compared with the extrapolation from elementary pp collisions via binary scaling (nuclear modification factor, R AA ). The precision on R AA needed to quantify the importance of nuclear effects is typically \u224310%. Thus, a precision on the order of 5% or better on the pp cross section (including luminosity normalisation) is desired in order not to be dominant in the overall uncertainty. Although it is not involved in R AA 1 , luminosity normalisation in Pb-Pb collisions is crucial for the measurement of other physics observables, e.g. in ultra-peripheral interactions.",

The chosen reference process (VBand) for all scans is the coincidence of hits in the V0 detector [1], which consists of two scintillator arrays located on opposite sides of the interaction point (IP): 2.8<\u03b7<5.1 (V0A) and -3.7<\u03b7<-1.7 (V0C). The VBand contamination from beam-gas collisions and afterpulses during the scan was measured by means of dedicated bunch crossing masks and found to be on the order of 0.1%. The VBand rate was measured as a function of the beam separation ( Fig. 1). The scan areas have been obtained with the numerical sum method. A set of corrections must be applied to the measured rate,   namely: pile-up correction (up to 40%); length scale calibration, needed for a precise determination of the beam separation and performed by displacing the beams in the same direction and measuring the primary vertex displacement with a pixel detector (SPD [1]); satellite (displaced) collisions of protons captured in non-nominal RF slots, spotted via the arrival time difference in the two V0 arrays [5]; beam intensity decay and emittance growth in time; beam centering, accounting for the fact that beams may not be completely overlapping in one transverse direction while scanning the other one. The beam intensity is measured separately for each circulating bunch by the LHC beam current transformers, and provided to the experiments after detailed analysis [5,6].",

The cross section was measured separately for all bunch pairs (Fig. 1), and the results averaged 3 . The results obtained in the three scans are presented in Table 1. The various sources of systematic uncertainty are listed in Table 1. With the availability of more scans, our level of confidence in the results has increased and some of the systematic uncertainties included in the May 2010 (and preliminary March 2011) result have been dropped from the October 2010 result. This fact, together with the improvement of the uncertainty on the beam intensities, led to a reduction of the total systematic uncertainty from 7% to less than 4% from May 2010 to October 2010.",

The system is completed by two small electromagnetic calorimeters (ZEM), located only on one side, 7.5 m away from the IP. The analysis technique is the same as described for the pp case. Scanned processes and preliminary results for their cross sections are summarised in Table 2. The main source of uncertainty is the fraction of ghost charge in the measured beam current, consisting of ions circulating along the LHC rings outside of nominally filled bunch slots, which do not contribute to the luminosity. Ghost charge corrrection is not applied to the result but a preliminary upper limit of 11% (at 68% confidence level) has been set [8].

The neutrons emitted in the process have a rapidity very close to the beam one, and can then be detected with the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The single and mutual electromagnetic dissociation cross section have been measured [13] from a sample of events triggered by the ZNor (ZNA || ZNC) process. The fractions of events in the sample where a given number of neutrons is emitted can be obtained via a fit to the energy deposition spectra in the calorimeters (Fig. 3). The fraction of events with at least one neutron in one of the two ZNs is proportional to the sum of the cross sections for single electromagnetic dissociation (\u03c3 sEMD ) and for hadronic interaction (\u03c3 had ), while the fraction of events with at least one neutron in one ZN and nothing in the other one is proportional to the difference between \u03c3 sEMD and the mutual electromagnetic dissociation cross section (\u03c3 mEMD ). In both cases, the constant of proportionality is the trigger cross section \u03c3 ZNor , measured in the November vdM scan and reported in Table 2. The measured cross sections \u03c3 ZNand_m and \u03c3 ZNand_h are linear combinations of the hadronic and mutual electromagnetic dissociation cross sections: the coefficients, related to the ZEM efficiency for detecting mutual electromagnetic and hadronic interactions, have been estimated by simulation using HIJING and RELDIS [14] for the hadronic and the electromagnetic part respectively. Using all the above information, \u03c3 sEMD and \u03c3 mEMD can be extracted: they are reported in Table 3, compared to the RELDIS predictions, which are found to be in good agreement with our results.",
