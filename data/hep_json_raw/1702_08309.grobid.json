The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 , recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events contain one isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and exactly two jets, with one of them identified as likely to contain a b-hadron. Stringent selection requirements are applied to discriminate t-channel single-top-quark events from background. The polarisation observables are extracted from asymmetries in angular distributions measured with respect to spin quantisation axes appropriately chosen for the top quark and the W boson. The asymmetry measurements are performed at parton level by correcting the observed angular distributions for detector effects and hadronisation after subtracting the background contributions. The measured top-quark and W -boson polarisation values are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. Limits on the imaginary part of the anomalous coupling g R are also set from model-independent measurements.",

At leading order in QCD perturbation theory, three sub-processes contribute to single top-quark production: an exchange of a virtual W boson either in the t-channel or in the s-channel, or the associated production of a top quark with an on-shell W boson (W t). The t-channel and s-channel processes do not interfere at next-to-leading-order in QCD and are thus well defined with that precision [1].",

The exchange of a space-like W boson due to the interaction of a light quark with a b-quark produces a top quark and a forward light-quark (called the spectator quark) in the final state. Furthermore, as a consequence of the vector minus axial-vector (V-A) form of the W tb vertex in the Standard Model, the -1 - produced top quarks are highly polarised, in particular along the direction of the spectatorquark momentum [2,3]. Within the Standard Model the top quark decays through the electroweak interaction into an on-shell W boson and a b-quark, with a lifetime much shorter than the time scale necessary to depolarise the spin. The information on the top-quark spin can thus be obtained from its decay products. The produced real W boson also possesses a polarisation (or helicity state), which can be extracted from angular distributions of its decay products through the measurement of spin-dependent observables [4].",

The uncertainties in these predictions due to the theoretical uncertainties in the helicity fractions are lower than 0.01 for both S 3 and T 0 . Combining the predicted degrees of polarisation P t = 0.91 and Pt = \u22120.86 with the t-channel single-top cross-sections \u03c3 t = 54.9 pb and \u03c3t = 29.7 pb calculated at NLO in QCD for top-quark and top-antiquark production [13], the Standard Model predictions for S 1,2 and A 1,2 are: S 1 = 0.46, A 1 = 0.23 and S 2 = A 2 = 0. These values are calculated at leading order (LO) in QCD from the expressions of the spin-density matrix elements given in refs. [4,5]. The uncertainties in these predictions resulting from the uncertainties in the top-quark, b-quark and W -boson masses, and from higher-order effects [14], are all smaller than 0.01. Measured values not equal to zero for the S 2 and A 2 spin observables would signal the presence of an imaginary coupling in the W tb vertex, since S 2 and A 2 are only sensitive to Im g R [4]. 1 However, S 2 is twice as sensitive as A 2 to Im g R , making this observable more suitable for determining this coupling. The other four W -boson spin observables are mainly sensitive to Re g R , with a poor sensitivity to Im g R [4,5].",

The measurement of P can also be performed from 1 Including one-loop QCD and electroweak corrections the prediction for gR in the Standard Model is (\u22127.17 \u2212 1.23i) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [15], leading to values of the order of 10 \u22123 for the S2 and A2 spin observables. 2 The asymmetries used in this article and in ref. [5] are related to the ones defined in refs. [4,16] through the forward-backward asymmetry A tW FB defined with respect to the combined angular observable cos \u03b8 W cos \u03b8 * [17], where \u03b8 W is the angle between the W -boson momentum in the top-quark rest frame and the top-quark spin axis. This asymmetry is proportional to the product of P and the sum of two W -boson helicity fractions, as reported in table 1. The W -boson spin observables S 3 and T 0 are derived from the forward-backward asymmetry A FB and from the edge-central asymmetry A EC of the cos \u03b8 * angular distribution, respectively. Using the definition [5] of the normal axis N = s t \u00d7 q and transverse axis T = q \u00d7 N , as illustrated in figure 2, S 1 and S 2 are determined from the forward-backward asymmetries A T FB and A N FB in the angular observables cos \u03b8 T and cos \u03b8 N , respectively. The A 1 and A 2 spin observables are determined from the forward-backward asymmetries A T,\u03c6 FB and A N,\u03c6 FB based on the combination of cos \u03b8 * with the cosine of the azimuthal angles \u03c6 * T and \u03c6 * N defined relatively to T and N , respectively. Limits on Im g R can be extracted from the measurement of the A N FB asymmetry, which has the highest sensitivity to this coupling. For small Im g R values, taking V L = 1 and V R = g L = 0, a linear dependence on Im g R is obtained for this asymmetry: A N FB = 0.64 P Im g R [5]. In this relation the weak dependence of P on Im g R , which is of quadratic form, is not included. As A N FB depends on P , the measured value of the A FB asymmetry is required to constrain P for the limit computation. The quadratic variation of P and \u03b1 as a function of Im g R [5,18] is taken into account when setting the limits through the JHEP04(2017)124 procedure explained in section 11. The A FB asymmetry is chosen to constrain P because its measurement is found to be independent of the value of Im g R assumed when unfolding the corresponding angular distribution; this is discussed in section 9.",

Jets are calibrated using an energy-and \u03b7-dependent simulation-based scheme, with in situ corrections based on data. The jet energy is further corrected for the effect of multiple pp interactions. To reject jets from pile-up events, a so-called jet-vertex-fraction criterion [55] is applied to the jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4: at least 50% of the scalar sum of the p T of the tracks associated with a jet is required to be from tracks compatible with the primary vertex. 4 Only events containing two reconstructed jets with p T > 30 GeV are selected. In addition, one of them must be b-tagged with |\u03b7| < 2.5, while the second jet is required to be untagged and to have |\u03b7| < 4.5. The b-tagging is performed using a neural network which combines three different algorithms exploiting the properties of a b-hadron decay in a jet [56]. The b-tagging algorithm is optimised to improve the rejection of cquark jets, since W -boson production in association with c-quarks is a major background for the selected final state. The requirement applied to the neural-network discriminant corresponds to a b-tagging efficiency of 50%, and mistagging rates of 3.9% and 0.07% for c-quark jets and light-flavour jets, respectively, as predicted in simulated tt events [57,58].",

This control region is also used in the normalisation fit described in section 7. Samples enriched in W +jets events (W +jets control region) are selected by applying a relaxed btagging requirement corresponding to an efficiency of 80%. In addition, all events satisfying the signal b-tagging requirement are excluded. For these two control regions the dilepton rejection and the four final selection cuts are not applied. An additional category of events is defined by selecting all events not passing any of the four signal selection cuts (anti-signal region). This region is only used in the normalisation fit, in combination with the tt control region.

For the chosen numbers of bins, the fractions of simulated events belonging to the diagonal elements of the migration matrices are found to be between 68% and 90%, depending on the angular observable. The selection efficiencies are between 0.6% and 1.6%, depending on the angular observable and on the bin range. The matrix inversion is performed by using the iterative Bayesian method [81] as implemented in the RooUnfold framework [82]. The number of iterations is chosen such that the absolute change in the extracted asymmetry between two successive steps becomes lower than 0.0005. The unfolding procedure has been validated through convergence and closure tests performed by using template distributions constructed from the t-channel Powheg-Box and Protos samples presented in section 4. The closure tests showed that the residual bias induced by the unfolding method is negligible, whatever the measured asymmetry. With the aim of testing their compatibility with the Standard Model predictions, all asymmetries described in section 2, except A N FB , are extracted using the Protos simulation generated with the Standard Model values of the W tb couplings to determine the migration matrix and the selection efficiency. For all the asymmetry measurements, the Standard Model W tb couplings, as implemented in the Powheg-Box generator, are considered for the subtracted top-quark backgrounds.",

It is observed that the presence of anomalous couplings in general modifies the kinematics in such a way that the efficiency corrections are dependent on the W tb couplings. While the measurement of A FB is found to be independent of the value of Im g R assumed in the unfolding corrections, the measurement of A N FB is found to depend on the unfolding corrections used. By applying an interpolation technique it is possible to unfold the cos \u03b8 N angular distribution independently of any assumption about Im g R , so that the extracted A N FB asymmetry, combined with A FB , can be used to constrain this coupling.",

An iterative procedure is applied to determine the coefficients of the linear combination until convergence is reached in the extracted A N FB asymmetry. The method proceeds as follows. An initial value of A N FB is first extracted using the standard Protos unfolding corrections. This value is then used to determine, via a Lagrange interpolation, the weights to be applied to the five predicted corrections. A new value of A N FB is obtained after unfolding the cos \u03b8 N angular distribution with these corrections using the Bayesian method. The chosen convergence criterion for the interpolation procedure requires that the difference between the extracted A N FB from two successive steps is smaller than 0.0005. By using template distributions given by Protos samples not used in the linear combination of the unfolding corrections (Im g R = \u00b10.043, \u00b10.144), it has been checked that this method recovers the generated asymmetries at parton level.  The sensitivity to Im g R of the cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 N distributions, which are used to set limits on this coupling, is illustrated in figure 8. In this figure the observed distributions are compared to the signal-plus-background predictions built by adding the signal templates given by the Protos samples generated with Im g R = 0 (Standard Model parameterisation) and Im g R = \u00b10.23, the latter corresponding to the maximum values considered in the interpolation method described above.",

As reported in section 7, W +light-flavour jets events give a small contribution in the signal region and no associated modelling uncertainty is taken into account. An additional shapemodelling uncertainty is considered for the W +jets distributions. Indeed, in the W +jets control region a few kinematic variables are slightly mismodelled, and the impact of this mismodelling is evaluated by reweighting the W +jets angular distributions in the signal region. The applied event weights are derived from matching to data (after subtraction of all processes other than W +jets) the mismodelled kinematic variables in the W +jets control region. This procedure leads to a conservative estimate since it also accounts for mismodelling of the W +light-flavour jets events, which have a much more important contribution in the W +jets control region than in the signal region.",
