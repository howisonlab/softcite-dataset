The measurement is performed for invariant masses of the lepton pairs, m '' , between 116 GeV and 1500 GeV using a sample of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions data at centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012. The data are presented double differentially in invariant mass and absolute dilepton rapidity as well as in invariant mass and absolute pseudorapidity separation of the lepton pair. The single-differential cross section as a function of m '' is also reported. The electron and muon channel measurements are combined and a total experimental precision of better than 1% is achieved at low m '' . A comparison to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions using several recent parton distribution functions and including next-to-leading order electroweak effects indicates the potential of the data to constrain parton distribution functions. In particular, a large impact of the data on the photon PDF is demonstrated.",

The study of this process has been fundamental in developing theoretical perturbative calculations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which are now performed at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy [2][3][4][5]. Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of neutral-and charged-current Drell-Yan processes mediated by Z/\u03b3 * and W exchange respectively at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV have been recently published by the ATLAS [6-8], CMS [9][10][11][12] and LHCb [13][14][15][16][17] collaborations. These data provide new constraints on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton, some of which have been used in recent global PDF fits [18][19][20].",

In the neutral-current case, the off-shell measurements are dominated by the electromagnetic quark couplings to the virtual photon \u03b3 * , whereas the on-shell measurements are dominated by the weak axial and vector couplings of the quarks to the Z boson. Therefore, the measurements have different sensitivity to the up-type and down-type quarks. At large m '' the measurements offer constraints on the large-x antiquark PDFs which are poorly known.

In particular, at the highest invariant masses accessible at the LHC, the observed dilepton spectrum may be sensitive to new physics, which could manifest itself as a resonance or a broad modification to the continuum spectrum. Such searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [24][25][26] have so far not found any significant deviations from the Standard Model, and the largest systematic uncertainty on the derived exclusion limits arises from the lack of knowledge of the PDFs at high x. Since at leading order the parton momentum fractions from the two protons (1 or 2) are given by x 1,2 = (m '' / \u221a s) e \u00b1y '' , where y '' is the dilepton rapidity, it can be seen that the large x region is accessible at large m '' in the case of central production (y '' = 0), as well as at lower m '' and large y '' .

A high-threshold trigger demands that the muon transverse momentum be above 36 GeV and collects most of the data sample. A supplementary low-threshold trigger requires an isolated muon with transverse momentum above 24 GeV. The isolation for muons is defined using the scalar sum of transverse momenta, P p T , of additional tracks divided by p \u00b5 T , the transverse momentum of the muon. This provides a good discriminant against the multijet background arising from the semileptonic decays of heavy quarks. This isolation definition is implemented in the low-threshold trigger in which the candidate muons are required to satisfy P p T (\u2206R = 0.2)/p \u00b5 T < 0.12. Muons are identified by tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer matched to tracks reconstructed in the inner detector and must satisfy |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 2.4.

The two variables are largely uncorrelated for the multijet background. In each control region the contamination from signal, top-quark, and diboson background is subtracted using simulation. The yield of multijet events in the signal region is predicted using the constraint that the yield ratio of opposite-charge to same-charge muon pairs is identical in the isolated and non-isolated regions. A comparison of the isolation distribution for muons in events with either same-charge and opposite-charge muon pairs shows a small linear deviation of up to 10% when extrapolated into the isolated signal region. This is found to be independent of m \u00b5\u00b5 , and is corrected for. For the region m \u00b5\u00b5 > 500 GeV there are insufficient same-charge isolated muon pairs to give a reliable estimate. Therefore, the background yield in the region m \u00b5\u00b5 < 500 GeV is fitted to two alternative functional forms and extrapolated to larger m \u00b5\u00b5 where the averaged prediction is taken as the estimate of the background yield.

The two measurement channels are defined with a common fiducial region given in section 6, therefore, they can be combined to further reduce the statistical uncertainty. A further reduction in the total uncertainty is also achieved by taking into account systematic uncertainties which are not correlated between the two measurement channels. A \u03c7 2 minimisation technique is used to perform the combination of the cross sections [79][80][81]. This method introduces a free nuisance parameter for each correlated systematic error source which contributes to the total \u03c7 2 , and therefore gives results that are different from a simple weighted average. The combination is performed separately for each differential cross-section measurement. The sources of uncertainty considered are discussed in section 7, some of which consist of several contributions. However, for ease of presentation only the major sources are reported in tables 6-11 giving a total of 35 nuisance parameters. Only the normalisation uncertainties of the tt and diboson backgrounds are correlated between the channels, using two common nuisance parameters. After the minimisation, no nuisance parameter is shifted by more than one standard deviation. The \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom, \u03c7 2 /dof , is found to be 14.2/12 = 1.19 for the single-differential cross section, 53.1/48 = 1.11 for the cross sections differential in m '' and |y '' |, and 59.3/47 = 1.26 for the cross sections differential in m '' and |\u2206\u03b7 '' |.",

The single-differential cross section as a function of m '' is shown in figure 10. The uncertainty bands assigned to the calculations show the combined 68% confidence level (CL) PDF and \u03b1 S variation, the renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties and the PI uncertainty. The \u03b1 S uncertainty is determined by varying \u03b1 S by 0.001 with respect to its default value of 0.118. The scale uncertainties are defined by the envelope of variations in which the scales are changed by factors of two subject to the constraint 0.5 \u2264 \u00b5 R /\u00b5 F \u2264 2. The relative uncertainty on the PI contribution represents the region covering 68% of the NNPDF2.3qed MC replicas, 2 corresponding to rather large values of 62%-92% depending on the bin. Figures 11 and 12 show the ratio of theoretical predictions for the double-differential cross sections to the combined measurements. The corresponding ratios for the singledifferential cross section are shown in the middle and lower panels of figure 10. The PI contribution reaches up to 15% in certain regions of phase space, as can be seen in the middle panels of figure 10 and the left panels of figures 11 and 12 where a comparison is shown between the ratios for the default calculation and a calculation neglecting the PI contribution. In the regions where the PI contribution is large the PI uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty band, otherwise the PDF uncertainty is dominant. Thus it can be inferred from, e.g., the middle panel of figure 10, that the PDF (PI) uncertainty dominates the uncertainty band at small (large) m '' . The uncertainties are similar at about m '' ' 200 GeV.",

This is confirmed by a \u03c7 2 minimisation procedure comparing data to theoretical predictions, which in combination with a Bayesian reweighting method shows a dramatic reduction of the uncertainties on the photon PDF.",

The luminosity uncertainty of 1.9% is not shown and not included in the overall systematic and total uncertainties. 0.81 0.02 -0.01 -0.05 -0.00 -0.02 0.08 0.11 -0.11 -0.01 0.00 -0.07 0.06 0.02 0.06
