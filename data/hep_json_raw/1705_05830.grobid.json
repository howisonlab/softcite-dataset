XENON100 is a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber with 62 kg of active mass, operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy and designed to search for nuclear recoils from WIMP-nucleus interactions. Here we explore inelastic scattering, where a transition to a low-lying excited nuclear state of 129 Xe is induced. The experimental signature is a nuclear recoil observed together with the prompt de-excitation photon. We see no evidence for such inelastic WIMP-129 Xe interactions. A profile likelihood analysis allows us to set a 90% C.L. upper limit on the inelastic, spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section of 3.3\u00d710 \u221238 cm 2 at 100 GeV/c 2 . This is the most constraining result to date, and sets the pathway for an analysis of this interaction channel in upcoming, larger dual-phase xenon detectors.",

The dark matter could be made of stable or long-lived and yet undiscovered particles. Well-motivated theoretical models beyond the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are natural candidates for dark matter. This hypothesis is currently being tested by several direct and indirect detection experiments, as well as at the LHC [1,2].",

The PMTs detect the prompt scintillation (S1) and the delayed, proportional scintillation signal (S2) created by a particle interacting in the active TPC region. The S2-signal is generated due to ionization electrons, drifted in an electric field of 530 V/cm and extracted into the gas phase by a stronger field of \u223c 12 kV/cm, where the proportional scintillation, or electroluminiscence, takes place. The horizontal position, (x, y), of the interaction site is reconstructed from the position of the S2 shower, while the depth of the interaction, z, is given by the drift time measurement. The TPC thus yields a three-dimensional event localization, with an (x, y) resolution of <3 mm (1 \u03c3), and a z resolution of <0.3 mm (1 \u03c3), enabling to reject the majority of background events via fiducial volume selections [7]. The ratio S2/S1 provides the basis for distinguishing between nuclear recoils (NRs), as induced by fast neutrons and expected from elastic WIMP-nucleus scatters, and electronic recoils (ERs) produced by \u03b2-and \u03b3-rays.

The largest fraction of the energy released in the event is via the ER, due to the emitted photon which loses its energy in the LXe. This represents an unusual signature compared to the one expected from an elastic scatter, and makes the signal region to overlap the ER background region. The region of interest (ROI) selected for this analysis surrounds the 39.6 keV xenon line in the (cS1,cS2)-plane and is based on 241 AmBe calibration data, where such inelastic scatters are induced by fast neutrons. The ROI extends from 60 to 210 PE in cS1, from 4\u00d7 10 3 to 16\u00d7 10 3 PE in cS2, such as to have at least 95% acceptance to all signal mass hypotheses. The ROI is further divided into sub-regions as shown in Figure 1. These sub-regions were defined to contain a (roughly) similar number of expected background events in each region, where we crosschecked that changing the binning choice does not impact the sensitivity. The control regions (denoted as CR1 and CR2 in the figures), are selected to be as close as possible to the ROI, and are used for cross checks of the background shape distribution.",

Our analysis closely follows the event selection criteria described in detail in [15] for Run-II, with the following few exceptions. The cut on the width of the S2 signal as a function of drift time (where the maximal drift time is 176 \u00b5s and the width values range from \u223c1-2 \u00b5s) has been optimized on a sample of events selected from the 39.6 keV line and set to a 95% acceptance of these. This cut ensures that the broadening of S2-signals due to diffusion is consistent with the z-position calculated from the observed time difference between the S1 and S2 signals. Events are required to be single-scatters by applying a threshold cut on the size of the second largest S2 peak. For this analysis, the threshold has been optimized to 160 PE and is constant with respect to S2 signal size.",

The detector-related light yield L y at 39.6 keV, necessary to evaluate the average number of prompt photons detected (\u00b5 cS1 ), is obtained from the NEST model [16][17][18] fit to data collected with several \u03b3-lines. The same model is used to predict the charge yield at 39.6 keV, which is then scaled according to the detector's secondary scintillation gain Y . The latter is determined from the detector's response to single electrons [19]. The energy resolution at 39.6 keV in cS1 and cS2 has been measured to be 15.8% and 14.7%, respectively, and is used to extract the standard deviations \u03c3 cs1 , \u03c3 cs2 . The correlation parameter is measured using the 164 keV line from the decay of the 131m Xe isomer (T 1/2 =11.8 d) produced during the 241 AmBe calibration. This \u03b3-line is chosen since, unlike the 39.6 keV line, it is not associated with a NR and a measure of the (cS1,cS2) correlation of a pure ER interaction is possible. The correlation coefficient however depends on energy due to electron recombination effects. Its measured value at 164 keV is thus corrected based on the NEST expected recombination fractions for those energies. The corrected correlation coefficient is then \u03c1 = \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.1. The cS1 and cS2 distributions from the NR contribution are predicted starting from the expected nuclear recoil energy spectrum of WIMP inelastic interactions [6]. The average cS1 and cS2 are given by equations 2 and 3 respectively:",

The parameterization and uncertainties of L eff as a function of nuclear recoil energy E nr are based on existing direct measurements [21]. The light yield for 122 keV ERs is taken from the same NEST model fit as described above. For cS2, the parameterization of Q Y (E nr ) is taken from [22]. Finally, all detector related resolution effects are introduced following the prescriptions described in [15]. The pdf of the ER and NR contributions are then convolved to obtain the overall pdf of the expected signal. A 2D (cS1 versus cS2) acceptance map is applied to the signal pdf to reproduce data selection effects. Acceptances are computed separately for each selection criteria using the 241 AmBe calibration sample. Acceptances of other selections such as the liquid xenon veto cut, and the single-scatter interaction, represent an exception for which a dedicated computation has been performed. The combined acceptance of all selection criteria in the region of interest is roughly constant for all masses and averages to (0.80 \u00b1 0.05). Figure 1 (a) shows an example of fully simulated signal model for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c 2 , normalized to 50 events.",

In these larger detectors, with lower intrinsic backgrounds from 85 Kr and 222 Rn decays, and improved self-shielding, the electronic recoil background will be reduced by a few orders of magnitude with respect to XENON100, and ultimately limited by solar neutrino interactions [35]. The discovery of this interaction channel would be a clear signature for a spin-dependent nature of the dark matter interaction, and would provide a potential handle to constrain the WIMP mass with data from one experiment only [6,36].",
