The obtained spectra are then compared to those measured in the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments. The simulations can be made consistent with the measured DAMA spectrum only by assuming higher than reported concentrations of some isotopes and even so leave very little room for the dark matter signal. We conclude that any interpretation of the annual modulation of the event rate observed by DAMA as a dark matter signal, should include full consideration of the background spectrum. This would significantly restrict the range of dark matter models capable of explaining the modulation effect.",

The most recent papers [3,4] based on DAMA/LIBRA measurements using 250 kg of NaI combined with the DAMA/NaI results presented improved statistical significance of the signal and evaluation of possible background sources and systematic uncertainties. The positive identification of the effect from dark matter particles is based on observation of the annual modulation of the event rate at low energies with period (one year) and phase consistent with those expected from dark matter halo models [5,6].",

(1), the total average rate of events in each energy bin is the sum of the background rate b(E) and the average rate of events from dark matter particles S 0 (E), the third term being cancelled out when averaged over a period of a year or several years. This means that if the background spectrum were known we would be able to check whether the sum of the reconstructed spectrum of the signal (S 0 (E)) and background (b(E)) matches the measured distribution. It turns out, however, that most efforts so far were directed to calculation of the signal (mainly S m (E)) in various models helping with interpretation of the measured annual modulation effect, but totally neglecting the background contribution to the event spectrum and the information about the dark matter models that can be extracted from the measured spectrum. The background event rate and spectrum can be simulated with a reasonable degree of accuracy if the abundances of radioactive isotopes in detector materials are known. The DAMA Collaboration should have included the evaluation of this spectrum in their results to support their claim of dark matter discovery.",

Self consistent analysis of the experimental data should include all components of the measured spectrum: background, modulated and non-modulated parts of the signal. In this way no information is missed and a proper fit of the measured spectrum to the sum of predicted distributions is possible. In practice, accurate calculation of the background spectrum in terms of the absolute event rate (events/kg/day/keV) can only be done with high accuracy if concentrations of radioactive isotopes in all materials in and around the detector are precisely known. However, any particular source of background radiation has a characteristic spectrum and a combination of spectra from different sources with certain weights should match observations with or without signal. Hence the difference between the measured and background spectra should be equal to the spectrum of dark matter events. Analysing the measured spectrum and simulated background would allow us to constrain the dark matter signal.",

In this paper we present detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the background spectrum in a modelled setup of the DAMA/LIBRA NaI(Tl) detector. We then discuss the implications that these results may have on interpretation of the signal claimed by the DAMA group. We demonstrate that the energy spectrum measured in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment can hardly include any dark matter signal by (i) subtracting some possible WIMP signals from the measured spectrum and comparing this to the simulated background and (ii) subtracting the simulated background spectrum from the measured one and showing that the difference spectrum has a minimum at low energies which would not be a usual feature for dark matter signals. We also show that some inconsistencies exist between low-energy and high-energy parts of the measured DAMA/LIBRA spectrum.",

Events produced by 60 Co decays in copper are also shown in Figure 1 assuming a decay rate of 60 Co of 10 mBq/kg. This rate is significantly higher than typically measured in low-background copper.

Multiple scattering events in two or more crystals with energy depositions exceeding 0.5 keV were excluded.

The main problem here is that only a range of concentrations in the different crystals can be found in Ref. [4], together with a value determined for one crystal as an example. The DAMA Collaboration reported [4] the ranges for decay rates of the isotopes 40 K, 129 I and 22 Na, as well as for some isotopes from the 238 U and 232 Th decay chains. We used the reported typical concentrations of these isotopes in the crystals to normalise the spectra shown in Figure 2: 5 ppt of 238 U (0.7 to 10 ppt was reported in Ref. [4] assuming equilibrium), 5 ppt of 232 Th (0.5 to 7.5 ppt was reported), 10 ppb of natural potassium (\u226420 ppb was reported), 0.2 ppt of 129 I (a similar value was reported but for two crystals only) and 6.46 \u00d7 10 \u221214 ppb of 22 Na. The 232 Th decay chain was reported to be in equilibrium [4] unlike 238 U for which the equilibrium was found to be broken: a factor of 5.5 higher rate was found at the end of the chain indicating higher concentration of 210 Pb than expected from the equilibrium. To plot the uranium spectrum in Figure 2 we assumed equilibrium in the uranium decay chain. Since the spectrum from 238 U chain does not have any features below 30 keV, the assumption of equilibrium should not affect the shape of the spectrum at low energies. Assuming higher concentration of 210 Pb compared to the equilibrium would result in a higher peak at 40-60 keV, inconsistent with the measurements.",

We have checked the production of the low-energy X-rays, conversion electrons and Auger electrons in GEANT4 and have found that, despite significant improvements, some low-energy photons and electrons are missing resulting in an energy imbalance and spectrum distortions if the radioactive decays happened inside the crystal. We have corrected this by requiring the conservation of energy, with a missing energy being deposited at the point of the decay. The correction becomes significant when a low-energy beta-decay is accompanied by the emission of low-energy X-rays or electrons that are missing from the GEANT4 library, in particular for 129 I decay.",

Figure 3 shows the energy spectra reported by the DAMA/NaI (open circles) and DAMA/LIBRA (filled circles) experiments. The spectra, as reported [2,3], were corrected for all detection and reconstruction efficiencies. The energy spectra from the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments are slightly different. This may be due to different cuts to remove PMT noise and different efficiencies in the two data sets at small energies where the rate is dominated by the PMT noise. The difference looks to be significant in the position of the peak at about 3 keV that is due to 40 K decay [4]. The energy spectra measured in other NaI detectors at low energies are different from those observed by the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments. The filled triangles show the spectrum of energy depositions as measured in NaI by the NAIAD experiment [10]. The DAMA spectra show the minimum at about 2 keV that was not seen in NAIAD. However, the absolute rate of events was higher in NAIAD than in DAMA/LIBRA. Event rate of about 2 events/kg/day/keV above 5 keV (similar to DAMA) was observed in Ref. [17] but the rate in the 3 keV peak was higher than in DAMA.",

This 'background spectrum' shows a deep minimum at about 1.5-2.0 keV.

The peak at about 3 keV is due to the intrinsic contamination of the crystals by 40 K [4]. The reported rate at 20-30 keV is about 0.5 events/kg/day/keV. It is not clear, however, at what energy and why the event rate drops from about 1 events/kg/day/keV as observed at 4-10 keV to about 0.5 events/kg/day/keV as observed at 20-30 keV. It is difficult to explain such a decrease in rate with our simulations. Note, however, that the DAMA Collaboration reported the spectra at 20-80 keV from two individual crystals only, whereas the spectrum below 10 keV is averaged over all 25 crystals. If the majority of the crystals show much higher rate at 20-30 keV, then the rates below 10 keV and above 20 keV might be consistent. Assuming typical concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium in PMTs, this external source of background does not contribute substantially to the total spectrum. The simulated absolute rate below 10 keV (solid curve in Figure 4) is significantly smaller than observed by DAMA (\u223c1 event/kg/day/keV, see Figure 3 above and Figure  27 in Ref. [4]). If the copper of the crystal case or shielding, or other materials are contaminated by 60 Co with a decay rate about 500 mBq/kg, then this source of radiation can explain the rate of events at 4-10 keV as measured by DAMA. The broad peak at 40-100 keV is due to the decay of 129 I. The event rate in the peak is consistent with that reported by the DAMA Collaboration [4].",

Any external source of background radiation would produce a broad back-scatter peak centered at about 150 keV. The dotted curve in Figure 4 shows the spectrum calculated using higher contaminations of potassium in the PMTs (12000 ppm or 1.2%) and in the crystals (20 ppb) to account for the flat part of the measured spectrum and absolute rate at low energies (including the peak at about 3 keV). Such a high concentration of potassium (or similarly very high concentrations of uranium or thorium) in low background PMTs looks unrealistic but is used to illustrate the effect of possible external source of background. In fact, such a source could be much closer to the crystal and not shielded by any light guides or copper. In this case the concentration needed to obtain the flat spectrum and the rate consistent with measurements at low energies might be smaller. For instance, as mentioned above, a high decay rate (about 0.5 Bq/kg) of 60 Co in copper around the detectors (case and shielding) could explain the observed rate at 4-10 keV.",

Even for a model with small cross-section, the measured spectrum minus signal (open circles in Figure 5) does not match the predictions at 1.5-2.5 keV.

In some energy bins in Figure 5, in particular at 2-3 keV, the calculated background rate exceeds the measured one. This can partly be corrected if we assume an uncertainty in the energy calibration of DAMA/LIBRA. For instance, shifting the experimental data by about 0.25 keV towards low energies can improve the agreement with simulations and opens the way to seeing what the signal spectrum could look like after background being subtracted from the measured rate. Figure 6 shows the measured DAMA/LIBRA spectrum shifted by 0.25 keV towards low energies. (Note that this is only an assumption and other ways of improving the agreement between the measured spectrum and the background taking into account the uncertainties in energy calibration, resolution, etc are possible.) Let us now require that the expected background spectrum should be less than the measured rate in any energy bin.

There may be, however, a simpler explanation of the annual modulation around 3 keV peak related to the selection of single hit events at these energies which are dominated by 40 K (see also Ref. [18] for discussion). This can be checked by looking at the time behaviour of the rate around 1460 keV and of the coincident events with a 3 keV energy deposition in one crystal and 1460 keV deposition in another one.

For instance, most WIMP models that fit the DAMA/NaI data [2,7,8] (some of them are already excluded by other experiments) are not compatible with the combination of background and signal spectra as shown in the figures. Most models require the non-modulated part of the signal to be at least 20-30 times bigger than the modulated part at 2-4 keV resulting in a deep minimum after the signal spectrum is subtracted from the measured one (see Figure 5).

            "text": "We have presented Monte Carlo simulations of the background rates and spectra due to different sources expected in the DAMA/LIBRA NaI crystals. Any specific source of background radiation has a characteristic spectrum and, ideally, the measured spectrum should be consistent with a combination of predicted spectra from the different sources. We have found that it is hard to match the measured spectrum of DAMA/LIBRA at low energies (even without signal) with the simulated background assuming measured concentrations of radioactive isotopes in NaI crystals. Some features (drop in observed intensity between 10 and 20 keV, low total rate from simulations) are difficult to explain and publication of the measured energy spectrum up to MeV energies by DAMA is necessary to clarify this point. If a signal is present, then the background (measured spectrum minus signal) should have a minimum at about 1.5-2 keV. Its position and depth depend on the model but it is very hard to obtain such a minimum with simulations. Significantly enhanced concentrations of certain isotopes in the crystals help to bring the predicted rate and shape of the spectrum to agreement with the measured spectrum at low energies but leave too little room for the dark matter signal. Any dark mater model that predicts a large ratio (above 10 at 2-4 keV) of non-modulated (average) to modulated parts of the spectrum can certainly be excluded. The assumption of higher concentrations of certain isotopes, although improving agreement with the low-energy part of the spectrum, results in some features that are not seen by DAMA at high energies. We do emphasise that any interpretation of the annual modulation of the event rate observed by DAMA, as dark matter signal, is incomplete without clear understanding of the background spectrum. Such integrated analysis would significantly restrict the dark matter models capable of explaining the modulation effect.",

The aforementioned concentrations of the radioactive isotopes were used. Assuming typical concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium in PMTs, this external source of background does not contribute substantially to the total spectrum. The simulated absolute rate below 10 keV (solid curve inFigure 4)is significantly smaller than observed by DAMA (\u223c1 event/kg/day/keV, seeFigure 3above andFigure 27in Ref.[4]). If the copper of the crystal case or shielding, or other materials are contaminated by 60 Co with a decay rate about 500 mBq/kg, then this source of radiation can explain the rate of events at 4-10 keV as measured by DAMA. The broad peak at 40-100 keV is due to the decay of 129 I. The event rate in the peak is consistent with that reported by the DAMA Collaboration[4].",
