The cases of interest are semileptonic (SL) B \u2192 X {c,u} \u2212 \u03bd decays, and B \u2192 Xs \u2212 + where the the di-lepton can be cc resonances or non-resonant electroweak penguins (EWP). We consider helicity amplitudes having non-zero relative phases that can be potential new sources for CP-violation. Our motivations for these additional phases include a complex right-handed admixture in the hadronic weak charged current for the SL decays and complex Wilson coefficients in the effective Hamiltonians for the EWP decays. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel technique of projecting out the individual angular moments in the full rate expression in a model-independent fashion. Our work is geared towards ongoing data analyses at BABAR and LHCb.",

The current article extends these results in the following fashion. Instead of assuming the relevant helicity amplitudes to be relatively real, as is the current status, we provide expressions corresponding to complex amplitudes. A specific motivation for admitting complex amplitudes in SL decays is to consider, instead of a purely left-handed (LH) weak charged current as in the SM, an additional complex right-handed (RH) admixture, R , that could arise in new physics (NP) scenarios, as shown in Fig. 1  [7,8]. A complex non-zero R leads to additional angular terms in the full differential rate. In particular, a non-zero phase in R can lead to CP violation in SL B decays [4,[8][9][10].",

It is well known that the helicity amplitudes here have non-zero relative phases [11]. Compared to the SL case, where the leptonic current is purely LH, both LH and RH components exist for the charged dilepton case. The LH and RH terms add incoherently to give the total rate. Therefore, while the number of angular observables remain the same, the number of independent real amplitude components to extract increases almost two-fold. The angular observables are not independent which leads to ambiguities in the solutions for the amplitudes [12,13].",

The SL and the resonant cc instances represent special cases leading to certain simplifications. We expand the full angular expression in an orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics and provide moments to project out each angular component. Since the basis is orthonormal, this reduces to a simple counting measurement. We explain how to extract the covariance matrix of the moments and the treatment of background subtraction, again, as counting measurements.
