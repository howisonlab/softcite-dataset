As an example, we extract the relative energy dependence of the flux from published MiniBooNE quasielastic scattering cross sections with \u03bd < 0.2 GeV and \u03bd < 0.1 GeV (here \u03bd is the energy transfer to the target). We find that the flux extracted from the 'low-\u03bd' cross sections is consistent with the nominal flux used by MiniBooNE. We fit the MiniBooNE cross sections over the entire kinematic range to various parametrizations of the axial form factor. We find that if the overall normalization of the fit is allowed to float within the normalization errors, the extracted values of the axial vector mass are independent of the flux. Within the Fermi gas model, the Q 2 distribution of the MiniBooNE data is described by a standard dipole form factor with M A = 1.41 \u00b1 0.04 GeV. If nuclear transverse enhancement in the vector form factors is accounted for, the data are best fit with a modified dipole form factor with M A = 1.10 \u00b1 0.03 GeV.",

The uncertainties in the modeling of the small energy dependent correction terms are small, thus we can extract the relative \u03bd \u00b5 flux from the number of low-\u03bd events at each E \u03bd bin. If we use the MINOS criteria that the fraction of events in the 'low-\u03bd' flux sample is lower than 60% of the total number of events in each E \u03bd,\u03bd \u00b5 bin, we find that for neutrinos we can use events with \u03bd < 0.1 GeV to extract the relative flux for E \u03bd > 0.4 GeV, and events with \u03bd < 0.2 GeV for E \u03bd > 0.7 GeV. For these \u03bd cuts, the cross section is dominated by quasielastic (QE) scattering. The flux extracted with the 'low-\u03bd' method is only a relative flux as a function of energy. It must be normalized at some energy. In this paper, we present the flux relative to the flux at E \u03bd = 1.1 GeV. In our calculation of QE cross sections we use BBBA2007 electromagnetic form factors [3].",

The data points are from the GENIE MC generator for a carbon target assuming a Fermi gas model and a dipole form for the axial form factor with M A = 0.99 GeV [4]. The ratio is independent of the value M A as illustrated by the fact that prediction of this ratio for a dipole axial vector mass M A = 1.014 GeV (solid red line) and M A = 1.3 GeV (solid blue line) are the same. Also shown are the changes in the prediction when we include nuclear enhancement in the transverse vector form factors [2] (TE) (shown as the solid black line).
