All currently used MC simulations contain only matrix elements at fixed order (leading or next-to-leading order) QCD, while higher orders are simulated by applying parton showers. Therefore, they are not precise enough to fix the renormalization scheme, which leads to an uncertainty in the input top quark mass definition.",

The measurement was performed by the CMS collaboration in tt decays with dileptonic final states using 1.14 fb \u22121 of collected data at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The results are in very good agreement with similar measurements by D0 and ATLAS and provide the first determination of the top quark pole and MS mass at CMS. The uncertainty of the results is dominated by the systematic error of the measured \u03c3 tt and by the PDF uncertainty in the theory, including the variation of \u03b1 S (M Z ) in the PDF.  [7,8] and the direct top quark mass world average [9]. The inner error bar on the CMS result includes the experimental, PDF and scale variation uncertainty, the outer one corresponds to the uncertainty including variation of \u03b1 S (M Z ) in the PDF.",
