One of the most sensitive channels in the discovery of the Higgs boson, H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , is expected to have top quark loops both in the production and decay of the Higgs boson in the SM. Hence, it is important to determine the couplings of the new boson to fermions, especially to the top quark. In the SM, one of the most promising channels for a direct measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling is the production of the Higgs boson in association with a tt pair (ttH), where the Higgs boson decays to bb, thus leading to a ttbb final state.",

This final state, which has not yet been observed, has an irreducible nonresonant background from the production of a top quark pair in association with a b quark pair. Calculations of the inclusive production cross section for tt events with additional jets have been performed to NLO preci-E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. sion [11][12][13][14][15][16]. For a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, the predictions for the production of a top quark pair with two additional jets ttjj and with two additional b quark jets ttbb are \u03c3 ttjj = 21.0 \u00b1 2.9 (scale) pb and \u03c3 ttbb = 0.23 \u00b1 0.05 (scale) pb, respectively [16]. In this calculation, the additional jets are required to have transverse momenta p T > 40 GeV/c and absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.5, while for the ttH production value quoted above, no such requirements are applied to the decay products of the Higgs boson. The dominant uncertainties in these calculations are from the factorization and renormalization scales [17,18] caused by the presence of two very different scales in this process, the top quark mass and the jet p T . Therefore, experimental measurements of \u03c3 ttjj and \u03c3 ttbb production can provide a good test of NLO QCD theory and important input about the main background in the search for the ttH process.",

The systematic uncertainty in the number of pileup events is estimated by conservatively varying this cross section by 5% to cover all the uncertainties in the modelling of the pileup physics.

An uncertainty to account for the variation of the ttcc fraction in the fit is also assigned by varying the contribution by 50%. This variation is chosen because the theoretical uncertainty in the ttjj cross section is less than 50%, and the fitted ttcc fraction re-mains within 50% of the input value when fitting with the ttcc contribution as a free parameter.",
