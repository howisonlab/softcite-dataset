            "text": "This paper presents a historical recollection of the neutrino experiments aimed at the study of charm physics in the last 40 years. In the seventies, many experimental facts indicated the existence of new particles made by a new quark called \"c\" for charm. After the discovery of the J/Psi in 1974 [1,2] clear-cut evidence for the c quark was expected from the measurement of the lifetime of particles with naked c. Lifetimes of the expected magnitude were indeed first measured in 1976 by a neutrino experiment using the high spatial resolution of emulsion detectors. Since then, neutrino experiments have continued to collect valuable information in different domains of charm physics. Because of the tiny neutrino cross-sections huge detectors are needed and this make direct observation difficult. Most of the experiments have identified charm production in their heavy detectors by tagging the production of leptons from charm decay. However, important results were also obtained by the direct observation of the decay of charmed particles in emulsion targets. This paper provides the basic information about all neutrino experiments relevant to the study of charm physics. We then summarize the present knowledge derived from these experiments on various issues, namely important between them the mass of the c quark, the s quark content of the nucleon, and the V cd and V cs elements of the CKM matrix. The paper is organized in the following way. First, in section 2, we recall the discovery of charm, which marked the beginning of neutrino experiments in the field. Then, in section 3, we summarize the basic theoretical formalism nowadays in use to describe the process of charm production in high energy neutrino-nucleon scattering. A complete list of neutrino experiments on charm, together with their main characteristics is given in section 4. The following sections contain a description of the experimental results. Results on opposite-sign dilepton events are summarized in section 5 where the analysis of these events is described. Information on double charm production and on multi-lepton events other than opposite-sign dilepton is discussed in section 6. Finally, section 7, deals with the few experiments which made use of nuclear emulsions to directly detect the short lived charmed particles. Brief concluding remarks can be found in section 8.",

            "text": "The existence of a fourth quark was predicted by Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani [3] in 1970. This quark was named charm by Bjorken and Glashow [4] and its existence was experimentally proven by the discovery in 1974 of the J/\u03c8 [1,2],the charm anti-charm meson state. Naked charms, i.e. hadron states containing a charm quark were first discovered in 1976 in e + e \u2212 annihilations at SLAC, by the observation of the D + [5] and D 0 [6,7] mesons. The characteristics of the detected narrow states made the authors of [5] write: ... strongly suggest they are the predicted isodoublet (D 0 and D + ) of charm mesons. However, the definite conclusion that these particles were charmed hadrons required a determination of their lifetimes. In fact, the charm quantum number being conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, charmed hadrons were expected to decay weakly with lifetimes of the order of 10 \u221213 s. The measurement of the lifetimes then required to use detectors with high spatial resolution, allowing to observe short decay paths. In 1975 Marcello Conversi [8] proposed to combine emulsion, bubble chamber and counter techniques to study new shortlived particles produced by neutrinos. An experiment using spark chambers and emulsions was performed in 1976 at Fermilab [9,10] and produced evidence for short-lived particles produced in neutrino interactions. An experiment conducted by Conversi, was then performed at CERN. Results were published in 1979 and succeeded to provide the first measurements of lifetimes for neutral and charged D particles [11,12]. Charmed baryons were also observed [13]. These fundamental experiments opened the way to the study of charm physics with neutrino beams, subject of our paper. Before concluding this section, we should add a comment on the first observation of naked charm. We like to recall that 5 years before the discovery at SLAC, events later ascribed to associated production of charmed hadrons were observed in Japan in 1971 in studies of cosmic ray events with emulsion technique [14]. A historical review on charm physics with emulsions in Japan is given in [15].",

Actually, the majority of neutrino experiments studying charm, use neutrino beams with energies from ten to a few hundreds GeV. In this energy domain the deep inelastic neutrino nucleon scattering is well described by the interaction of the neutrino with the quarks inside the nucleon. In this picture, the charm quark can be produced by a CC interaction on a constituent d quark, or on a d or s quark of the sea. To the lowest order, the scattering formula is written as [17] ",

They take into account the two channels of production of the c quark, namely the transitions d \u2192 c and s \u2192 c. The classification of quark in doublets, with the c and s quarks belonging to the same doublet makes s \u2192 c the natural transition for charm production. The transition d \u2192 c is also allowed, because of the mixing described by the Cabibbo angle. In neutrino scattering on nucleon both contributions represent only a few percent of the total cross-section. The transition s \u2192 c is disfavored because it involves the s quark, which is only present in the sea. The d \u2192 c channel is in turn suppressed by the smallness of the Cabibbo angle. A similar formalism can be used to describe \u03bd \u00b5 nucleon scattering. An important difference is that with antineutrino the CC process leads to the production of the charm antiquark c. The production of charm is then obtained from the scattering on d or s, present only in the sea. Many corrections and details have to be studied, when applying to real data the formalism described above. For instance, the passage from quarks to the observed particles is usually parameterized in terms of the so called fragmentation function D(z), where z is the fraction of the charm quark energy carried by the charmed hadron. The basic formulae given above clearly show how measurements of total and differential cross-sections for charm production with neutrino and antineutrino beams can give very important information on the structure functions and the structure of the nucleon, on the elements of the CKM quark mixing matrix, and on the mass of the c quark. Note that besides single charm production in CC interactions, other rarer processes have also been studied, like cc production in neutral current scattering (single c production can not happen by Z exchange, since the Z can not produce a change of quark flavor).",

They usually have limited granularity and do not allow to identify single hadrons. Measurements of hadrons are in this case restricted to the energy and direction of the hadronic shower. Charged muons instead, are penetrating particles and can therefore be identified, and their momentum be measured in a magnetic field. The usual event classification in CC or NC (Charged or Neutral Current) interactions is then based, for \u03bd \u00b5 interactions for example, on the presence or absence of a \u00b5 \u2212 in the final state.

Events of this kind are called \"opposite sign dimuons\" and constitute the largest sample of charm events studied with neutrino beams. A background is present, mainly due to pions of the hadronic shower, which occasionally decay or simulate the behaviour of muons. Nevertheless, statistical analysis of the data have yielded very accurate measurements of differential cross-sections for charm production, and allowed the studies mentioned in the previous section. More in general, the identification of muons, and in some case of electrons, has been the main tool of investigation of charm physics with neutrino beams. Note however that other important results were obtained by a few experiments using emulsion targets. In this case the high spatial resolution allowed to directly identify charmed hadrons through the observation of decay paths of few millimeters. Then, properties of the charmed hadrons, like lifetimes and branching ratios could be directly investigated.

            "text": "Neutrino beams for charm studies were operated at CERN and at Fermilab using their respective proton accelerators. Different setups were adopted to vary the energy spectrum and flavour content of the beam, but the basic principle of operation is always the same. To illustrate it, we take the example of the Wide Band Beam (WBB) generated with the 400 GeV Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. A scheme of the beam layout is shown in figure 1 (sizes and distances are not in scale). Protons extracted from the accelerator im- pinge on a cylindrical target where they interact producing pions and kaons. Two magnets with specially designed field configuration, the so-called Horn and Reflector, allow to focus and charge-select the mesons. The mesons go through the decay tunnel, an evacuated region 258 meters long, where a substantial fraction of them decays producing a collimated beam of neutrinos (neutrinos for positive mesons, antineutrinos for negative mesons). After the decay tunnel, the remaining hadrons and the muons that are produced along with the neutrinos are absorbed in a shield of adequate thickness. For given intensity and energy of the primary proton beam, the characteristics of the neutrino beam (intensity, energy spectrum, flavor content) depend from the design of the focusing magnetic field and from the length of the decay tunnel. The neutrino energy spectrum of the CERN WBB peaks typically around 30 GeV, and the intensity drops by a factor 100 at about 150 GeV. The total contamination of wrong flavours (\u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd e , \u03bd e ) is only a few percent in the \u03bd \u00b5 beam, and goes up to 10% in the \u03bd \u00b5 beam. At CERN it was also possible to run the so-called Narrow Band Beam (NBB), which operated a selection in momentum of pion and kaons (typically at 200 GeV). The NBB had much lower intensity but provided a two-components (pions and kaons) flat neutrino energy spectrum and better control of the contamination of neutrinos of the wrong flavor. Similar techniques were adopted at Fermilab where the proton beam of the Tevatron accelerator ran with energies up to 1000 GeV. A list of the Fermilab neutrino beams can be found in ref [19].",

            "text": "Opposite-sign dimuons have been the main tool of investigation of charm physics with neutrino beams. In that process, described in the previous sections, the leading muon (the muon of highest energy) is interpreted as originating from the neutrino vertex, while the oppositesign muon (or electron in bubble chamber detectors) as due to the leptonic decay of the charm inside the hadronic shower. The history of dimuons starts already in 1974, the year of the J/Psi discovery, when the HPWF Collaboration at Fermilab found two events attributed to the reaction \u03bd \u00b5 +N \u2192 \u00b5+hadrons followed by a muonic decay inside the hadronic shower. In their paper the authors mention the following interpretation [23]: One possibility is that the particle jet produced by very high energy neutrinos has an anomalously large probability to decay into a (positive) muon. Models generating this type of effect due to the presence of novel hadronic quantum numbers (charm) have been recently suggested by Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani [3]. The HPWF experiment was also the first to confirm in 1975 charm production in a neutrino beam by publishing results obtained with a sample of about 100 dimuons [87]. From then on, all neutrino experiments searched for dimuon events and a complete list of dimuon (or better dilepton) experiments is given in the following The CDHS Collaboration at CERN reached in the early eighties the largest statistics, with 9922 dimuons collected in neutrino beam, and 3123 in antineutrino beam. The picture was later completed with the high energy data collected in 2001 by the NuTeV experiment [17] using the neutrino beam produced by the 1 TeV protons of the Fermilab Tevatron.",

The main contribution should come from the so-called \" gluon-boson fusion \" process [107] shown in fig 4 in NC reactions, and from the \" gluon-quark bremsstrahlung \" process [108] shown in fig 5 in CC reactions. Both processes are rare, mostly because of the higher threshold of 3.7 GeV for two charmed mesons, and difficult to isolate. Many searches for cc production were performed using the massive electronic detectors and looking for muons from charm decay. The first evidence only came in year 2000 from the high statistics, high energy NuTeV- E815 experiment at Fermilab. Its result was then confirmed by the CHORUS experiment at CERN, by detecting the decay of charmed hadrons in its emulsion target.

Since there is no single charm production in NC interactions, it is assumed that a second undetected charmed hadrons is present in the hadron shower. First searches for wrong-sign muons only led to negative results. For instance, data taken with the CCFR detector at Fermilab are analyzed in a 1989 paper [109] resulting in a number of wrong sign muons compatible with that expected from background. First evidence for cc production, and up to now the only evidence with wrong-sign muon events, was obtained in year 2000 by the NuTeV-E815 experiment at Fermilab.

The second muon is associated to the decay of a charmed hadron. It is then assumed that a second, undetected, charmed hadron is present, since in the case of single charm production the muon from charm decay would have opposite sign with respect to the leading muon.

The spatial resolution of nuclear emulsions makes possible the direct detection of charmed particles through the observation of the few millimeters long decay-paths. Contrary to the electronic experiments described in the previous sections, the charmed hadrons detected in emulsions are then practically background free and so single events can give relevant information. In fact, following the proposal of Conversi [8] two fundamental experiments, E247 at Fermilab and WA17 at CERN were carried on in the late seventies. The two experiments made use of an emulsion target followed by few electronic detectors to identify and measure momenta of charged particles. In 1976 E247 [9,10] was the first to measure the lifetimes of the new hadrons showing that these were consistent with the expectation for hadrons with charm. In 1979 the few events collected by WA17 [11,13] allowed to establish a difference in lifetime between charged and neutral charmed hadrons, confirming theoretical predictions for the decay process involving the c quark. WA17 also observed the decay of one charmed baryon [12]. After the two historical experiments, emulsion target were rarely used for the study of charm physics with neutrino beam, mainly because the analysis of emulsion film has to be performed manually at microscopes and the scanning phase makes it long and difficult to collect large statistics. Nevertheless, few important measurements were reported in the eighties by the E531 experiment at Fermilab. Ten years later a large sample of charm events was collected by the CHORUS experiment at CERN, which exploited the huge progress in the au-tomation of the process of emulsion scanning. We shall now give some detail on these two experiments.",

Nowadays experiments with neutrino are designed to study oscillations, aiming at a complete understanding of the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings, and perhaps of CP violations in the neutrino sector (a review on neutrino oscillation experiments can be found in [125]). So, after having played an important role in the measurement of the CKM matrix, neutrino experiments are now engaged in the new task of unveiling the complete Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. We should add that in our opinion, charm physics with neutrinos has strongly influenced the evolution of the overall picture of quarks in particle physics. By studying the role of valence and virtual quarks, the role of quark masses in the scattering and hadronization processes, neutrino charm physics has contributed to our current understanding of quarks in the Standard Model.",
