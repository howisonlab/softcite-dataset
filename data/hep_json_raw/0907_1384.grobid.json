These decays proceed via a flavor changing neutral current process; yet to be discovered hypothetical particles, e.g., in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [1] or left-right symmetric model [2], may contribute and cause a sizable deviation from the branching fraction (BF) predicted by the SM. The BF prediction \u00f03:15 AE 0:23\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 [3], and the average experimental value \u00f03:56 AE 0:26\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c04 [4], are in marginal agreement. A measurement with improved precision provides a more stringent test and gives stronger constraints on models beyond the SM.",

We compare the results from five signal models [22] with corresponding model parameters derived from fits to the signal spectrum derived from the MAIN stream shown in Fig. 1(a). We assign the maximum deviation from the Kagan-Neubert model as the uncertainty (7). The errors associated to the measurement of the photon energy resolution and photon detection efficiency in radiative -pair events are varied (8,9), where the former has an uncertainty of 1%. To account for the higher multiplicity hadronic environment of B \" B decays and secondary effects in the estimation of photons from B \" B, we assign twice (AE2) the variation as the associated systematic error (9).
