            "text": "We present the results of a search for the rare decays B \u2192 h\u03bd\u03bd, where h stands for K + , K 0 S , K * + , K * 0 , \u03c0 + , \u03c0 0 , \u03c1 + and \u03c1 0 . The results are obtained with 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider. We reconstruct one B meson in a semileptonic decay and require a single h meson but nothing else on the signal side. We observe no significant signal and set upper limits on the branching fractions. The limits set on the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03bd\u03bd, B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bd\u03bd, B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd, B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd, B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03bd\u03bd, and B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03bd\u03bd channels are the world's most stringent. The decays B \u2192 h\u03bd\u03bd [1] can proceed only via a penguin or a box diagram at leading order in the standard model (SM), as shown in Fig. 1, and are thus highly suppressed [2]. Theoretical calculations for the branching fractions cover the range from 1.2\u00d710 \u22127 [3] (B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) to 9.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 [2] ( B + \u2192 K * + \u03bd\u03bd ). Recent results by LHCb [4,5] show evidence for a deviation of experimental data from expected values in the angular observable P 5 in B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, and in the ratio of the B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 to B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 branching fractions. A measurement of P 5 by Belle [6] is compatible with both, the SM prediction and the LHCb result. Different new physics models proposed to explain these observations can also influence B \u2192 K ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd decays. Therefore, B \u2192 h\u03bd\u03bd channels provide an important test for any model proposed to solve these tensions. Additionally, B \u2192 h\u03bd\u03bd channels are theoretically clean due to the mediation of the transition by a Z boson alone, in contrast to B \u2192 K ( * ) l + l \u2212 decays [2] where the photon contributes.",

A data set of 89 fb \u22121 taken at an energy 60 MeV/c 2 below the resonance energy is used to study background from e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq processes (continuum), where q \u2208 u, d, s, c. We refer to this data set as the off-resonance sample. We model the decays with the EVTGEN package [12] and simulate the detector response with the GEANT3 package [13]. We include a randomly-triggered sample to account for beam-related background. The signal process is modeled according to three-body phase space. The Belle detector [14] is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrellike arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a super-conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [14]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 152 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs, while a 1.5 cm beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 620 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs [15].",

Furthermore, we remove events with two or more tracks not fulfilling our requirement on dr or dz \"raw tracks.\" We veto events with reconstructed K 0 L candidates and weight our background simulations to account for known data-MC differences, as described in Ref. [21]. An important variable to identify correctly-reconstructed signal events is the extra energy, E ECL . We sum all ECL clusters not used in the reconstruction of the \u03a5(4S) candidate, not associated with a track, and fulfilling the same energy requirements as the clusters used to form \u03c0 0 candidates. We require E ECL < 1.2 GeV/c 2 . We also require the momentum of the h sig candidate in the CM system to fulfill p cms \u2208 [0.5, 2.96] GeV/c 2 , the missing energy in the CM system E miss > 2.5 GeV/c 2 , the momentum of the B tag lepton candidate in the CM system p ltag < 2.5 GeV/c 2 , and a minimal tag quality of N tag > 0.005. These requirements are motivated by kinematic boundaries, data-MC differences in case of low-momentum h sig , and badly reconstructed tag candidates. To suppress pions from D decays misreconstructed as muons, we veto events where the invariant mass of the K (K * 0 ) candidate and the tag-side lepton fulfill M Kl \u2208 [1.85, 1.87] GeV/c 2 . The channel-dependent fraction of events with more than one \u03a5(4S) candidate can be as large as 20 %, dominated by candidate exchange between signal-and tag-side. In such cases, we select the candidate with the highest N tag value, i.e., the candidate with the highest probability of being correctly reconstructed. In MC studies, we find that the efficiency of this selection is between 65 % (B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03bd\u03bd) and 92 % (B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03bd\u03bd).

Both channels can be reconstructed with negligible background and are well described in MC. We bin N tag equally in 4 (3) bins for charged (neutral) B mesons and calculate the number of reconstructed events in data and MC. We assign the ratio as a weight in each bin of N tag . This calibration includes a correction of the tagging efficiency \u00d7 the number of BB pairs produced (N BB ) \u00d7 the branching fraction of \u03a5(4S) to charged and neutral B meson pairs, as we have a separate calibration for B + and B 0 . We train one neural network per channel to suppress continuum events. We use 16 modified Fox-Wolfram moments [22], nine CLEO cones [23], the cosine of the angle of the thrust axis relative to the z axis, and the angle of the momentum of the B tag candidate with respect to the z axis. We refer to the output of this neural network as N CS .",

The \u00b11 \u03c3 quantiles of the resulting distribution are used as estimators of the uncertainty. We estimate the uncertainty on the \u03c0 0 and charged track vetoes by comparing the respective efficiency differences between data and MC for the B \u2192 D\u03c0 sample with and without the veto applied. We obtain a value of 4 % in both cases for charged and neutral channels alike. We evaluate the influence of the requirement on the number of raw tracks via the same sample by setting it to two and zero, respectively. We subsequently average the contributions and obtain a value of 1 %. The uncertainty on the calibration (9.6%) includes the uncertainty on the correction of N BB (1.4%) and the uncertainty on B (B \u2192 D\u03c0). Based on studies using dedicated control samples, we assign 2.0 %, 4.0 %, and 2.2 % for the uncertainties on PID efficiency, \u03c0 0 efficiency and K 0 S efficiency, respectively. The systematic uncertainty is included by convolving the likelihood function with a Gaussian with zero mean and a width equal to the square root of the quadratic sum of the additive and multiplicative error. The additive uncertainty is defined as the uncertainty on the signal yield, and contributions are summarized in Table II. A comparison of our results with previous ones is presented in Fig. 3.
