In addition, Z/\u03b3 * + jets production is a background to many rare standard model (SM) processes, such as Higgs-boson production, and searches for non-SM physics.

These measurements are in qualitative agreement with predictions from perturbative QCD at the next-toleading order (NLO) expansion in the strong-interaction coupling, but are limited by the small number of events with high multiplicity of jets. Recently, measurements have also been published by the ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] collaborations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, since the understanding of these SM processes is essential in the search for non-SM physics at the LHC.",

            "text": "In this article, measurements of differential cross sections for Z/\u03b3 * + jets production are presented, using the full data sample of proton-antiproton collisions collected with the CDF II detector in Run II of the Tevatron Collider, which corresponds to 9.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The results include differential cross sections as functions of jet transverse momentum, p T , and rapidity, y [6], extended for the first time at CDF to the Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jets final state; the total cross section as a function of jet multiplicity up to four jets; and several differential distributions for events with a Z/\u03b3 * boson and at least one or two jets. Measurements are compared to NLO [7,8] and approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) perturbative QCD predictions [9], to NLO QCD predictions including NLO electroweak corrections [10], and to distributions from various Monte Carlo (MC) generators that use parton showers interfaced with fixed-order calculations [11,12]. This paper is organized as follows: Section II contains a brief description of the CDF II detector. The data sample and the event selection are presented in Sec. III. The MC samples used across the analysis are listed in Sec. IV. The estimation of the background contributions is described in Sec. V. The unfolding procedure is explained in Sec. VI. The systematic uncertainties are addressed in Sec. VII. The theoretical predictions are described in Sec. VIII. The measured differential cross sections are shown and discussed in Sec. IX. Section X summarizes the results.",

            "text": "The CDF II detector, described in detail in Ref. [13], is composed of a tracking system embedded in a 1.4 T magnetic field, surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and muon spectrometers. The CDF experiment uses a cylindrical coordinate system in which the z axis lies along the proton beam direction, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle, and \u03b8 is the polar angle, which is often expressed as pseudorapidity \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. The tracking system includes a silicon microstrip detector [14] covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2, which provides precise three-dimensional reconstruction of charged-particle trajectories (tracks). The silicon detector is surrounded by a 3.1 m long open-cell drift chamber [15], which covers a pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1, providing efficient pattern recognition and accurate measurement of the momentum of charged particles. The calorimeter system is arranged in a projective-tower geometry and measures energies of photons and electrons in the |\u03b7| < 3.6 range. The electromagnetic calorimeter [16,17] is a lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter, which also contains proportional chambers at a depth corresponding approximately to the maximum intensity of electron showers. The hadronic calorimeter [18] is an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter. The muon detectors [19], located outside the calorimeters, consist of drift chambers and scintillation counters covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 1.0. Finally, the luminosity is computed from the rate of inelastic pp collisions determined by the Cherenkov counters [20] located close to the beam pipe.",

            "text": "In addition to a Z boson candidate, one or more jets with p T 30 GeV/c and rapidity |y| 2.1 are required. Jets are reconstructed using the midpoint algorithm [22] in a cone of radius R = 0.7 [23]. Calorimeter towers are clustered if the energy deposits correspond to a transverse energy larger than 0.1 GeV [24] and used as seeds if larger than 1 GeV. Towers associated with reconstructed electrons and muons are excluded. A split-merge procedure is used, which merges a pair of cones if the fraction of the softer cone's transverse momentum shared with the harder cone is above a given threshold; otherwise the shared calorimeter towers are assigned to the cone to which they are closer. The split-merge threshold is set to 0.75. Jet four-momenta are evaluated by adding the four-momenta of the towers according to the E-scheme, p \u00b5 jet = \u2211 p \u00b5 towers , described in Ref. [25]. With such a recombination scheme, jets are in general massive, and in order to study the jet kinematic properties, the variables p T and y are used, which account for the difference between E and p due to the jet mass. Since the jet transverse momentum measured by the calorimeter, p T,cal , is affected by instrumental effects, an average correction [26] is applied to p T,cal . These effects, mainly due to the noncompensating nature of the calorimeter and the presence of inactive material, are of the order of 30% for p T,cal around 40 GeV/c and reduce to about 11% for high p T,cal jets. A further correction is applied to account for the energy contributions to jets from multiple pp interactions, but no modification is made to account for underlying-event contributions or fragmentation effects. The requirement of p T 30 GeV/c is applied to the corrected jet transverse momentum. Events are selected if the leptons are separated from the selected jets by \u2206R \u2212jet 0.7 [27].",

The MLM matching procedure [31] is applied to avoid double-counting of processes between the matrix-element calculations and the parton-shower algorithm of PYTHIA. In addition, samples of tt, associated production of W and Z bosons (WW , W Z, ZZ), and inclusive Z/\u03b3 * production are generated using PYTHIA v6.2 with the same PDF set and Tune A [32]. All the samples are passed through a full CDF II detector simulation based on GEANT [33], where the GFLASH [34] package is used for parametrization of the energy deposition in the calorimeters, and corrected to account for differences between data and simulation in the trigger selection and lepton identification efficiencies. The electron E T and the muon p T scale and resolution are corrected to match the dilepton invariant mass distributions M observed in the data in the region 84 M 98 GeV/c 2 . Simulated Z/\u03b3 * + jets samples are also reweighted with respect to the number of multiple pp interactions in the same bunch crossing so as to have the same instantaneous luminosity profile of the data. The MC samples are used to determine background contributions and derive the unfolding correction factors described in Sec. VI.",

First, the probability for a jet to pass the electron selection requirements is evaluated using an inclusive jet data sample. This is denoted as fake rate and is parametrized as a function of the jet transverse energy. The fake rate is applied to jets from a sample of events with one reconstructed electron: for each event, all the possible electron-jet combinations are considered as Z/\u03b3 * candidates, the jet transverse energy is corrected to match on average the corresponding electron energy, and all the electron-jet pairs that fulfill the selection requirements are weighted with the corresponding fake rate associated with the jet, and used to estimate the background rate for each observed distribution.",

Three sources of systematic uncertainty are considered: the absolute jet-energy scale, multiple pp interactions, and the \u03b7dependent calorimeter response. The absolute jet-energy scale uncertainty depends on the response of the calorimeter to individual particles and on the accuracy of the simulated model for the particle multiplicity and p T spectrum inside a jet. This uncertainty significantly affects observables involving highp T jets and high jet multiplicity. The jet-energy uncertainty related to multiple pp interactions arises from inefficiency in the reconstruction of multiple interaction vertices, and mainly affects jets with low p T and high rapidity, and events with high jet multiplicity.

For the LOOPSIM+MCFM predictions, the notation n p N q LO introduced in Ref. [9] is used, which denotes an approximation to the N p+q LO result in which the q lowest loop contributions are evaluated exactly, whereas the p highest loop contributions are evaluated with the LOOPSIM approximation; according to such a notation, the approximate NNLO LOOPSIM+MCFM predictions are denoted with nNLO. The NLO MCFM predictions are available for final states from Z/\u03b3 * production in association with one or more, and two or more jets, LOOPSIM+MCFM only for the Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final state, NLO BLACKHAT+SHERPA for jet multiplicity up to Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jets, and POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions are available for all jet multiplicities but have NLO accuracy only for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet. The ALPGEN LO calculation is available for jet multiplicities up to Z/\u03b3 * + 6 jets but, for the current comparison, the calculation is restricted to up to Z/\u03b3 * + 4 jets. Electroweak corrections at NLO are available for the Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final state. Table III lists the theoretical predictions which are compared to measured cross sections.",

The MSTW2008 [39] PDF sets are used as the default choice in all the predictions.

The contribution to the NLO MCFM prediction uncertainty due to the PDF is estimated with the MSTW2008NLO PDF set at the 68% confidence level (CL), by using the Hessian method [40]. There are 20 eigenvectors and a pair of uncertainty PDF associated with each eigenvector. The pair of PDF corresponds to positive and negative 68% CL excursions along the eigenvector. The PDF contribution to the prediction uncertainty is the quadrature sum of prediction uncertainties from each uncertainty PDF. The impact of different PDF sets is studied in MCFM, ALPGEN and POWHEG. The variation in the predictions with CTEQ6.6 [41], NNPDF2.1 [42], CT10 [43], and MRST2001 [44] PDF sets is of the same order of the MSTW2008NLO uncertainty.

TABLE III. Summary of the theoretical predictions compared to the measured cross sections. The order of the expansion in the stronginteraction coupling (QCD order), the order of the expansion in the fine-structure constant (EW order), the matching to a parton shower, and the available jet multiplicities in Z/\u03b3 * + jets production are shown for each prediction. This is the largest uncertainty associated with the theoretical models, except for the ALPGEN+PYTHIA prediction, where the largest uncertainty is associated with the variation of the renormalization scale using the Catani, Krauss, Kuhn, Webber (CKKW) scale-setting procedure [50]. In the ALPGEN prediction, the value of the QCD scale, \u039b QCD , and the running order of the strong-interaction coupling constant in the CKKW scale-setting procedure, \u03b1 CKKW s , are set to \u039b QCD = 0.26 and one loop, respectively [51]. These settings match the corresponding values of \u039b QCD and the running order of \u03b1 s for ISR and FSR of the PYTHIA Tune Perugia 2011. The variation of the CKKW renormalization scale is introduced together with an opposite variation of \u039b QCD in the PYTHIA tune. Simultaneous variations of the renormalization and factorization scales for the matrix element generation in ALPGEN were found to be smaller than the variation of the CKKW scale [49]. The differences with respect to the previously used Tune A and Tune DW [52] are studied, with the \u03b1 s -matched setup of Tune Perugia 2011 providing a better modeling of the shape and normalization of the Z/\u03b3 * + jets differential cross sections. In the case of Tune A and Tune DW, the running of \u03b1 CKKW s in ALPGEN and \u039b QCD in PYTHIA is determined by the PDF set, which is CTEQ5L in both to avoid mismatch. The POWHEG calculation is performed with the weighted events option, and the Born suppression factor for the reweight is set to 10 GeV/c, following Ref. [12]. Further studies on the impact of different choices of the functional form of the renormalization and factorization scales have been performed in Ref. [49].",

Another important effect that is not accounted for in the perturbative QCD predictions and needs to be evaluated is the quantum electrodynamics (QED) photon radiation from leptons and quarks. Both ISR and FSR are considered, with the main effect coming from FSR. The inclusion of QED radiation also corrects the Z/\u03b3 * + jets cross sections for the contribution of Z/\u03b3 * + \u03b3 production, which enters the definition of the Z/\u03b3 * + jets particle level used in this measurement. The nonperturbative QCD effects and the QED radiation are estimated with the MC simulation based on the \u03b1 s -matched Perugia 2011 configuration of ALPGEN+PYTHIA, where PYTHIA handles the simulation of these effects. To evaluate the corrections, parton-level and particle-level ALP-GEN+PYTHIA cross sections are defined: parton-level cross sections are calculated with QED radiation, hadronization, and multiparton interactions disabled in the PYTHIA simulation, whereas these effects are simulated for the particle-level cross sections. Kinematic requirements on leptons and jets and jet-clustering parameters for the parton and particle levels are the same as those used for the measured cross sections, and photons are recombined to leptons in \u2206R = 0.1 if radiated photons are present in the final state. The corrections are obtained by evaluating the ratio of the particle-level cross sections over the parton-level cross sections, bin-by-bin for the various measured variables. Figure 3 shows the parton-toparticle corrections as functions of inclusive jet p T and inclusive jet rapidity for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events, with the contributions from QED ISR and FSR radiation, hadronization, and underlying event. The corrections have a moderate dependence on jet multiplicity, as shown in Fig. 4. Figure 5 shows the parton-to-particle corrections evaluated with various tunes of the underlying-event and hadronization model in PYTHIA, namely Tune A [32], Tune DW [52], Tune Perugia 2011 [30], and Tune Z1 [56], and with the ALPGEN+PYTHIA or POWHEG+PYTHIA simulations. The corrections are generally below 10%, and independent of the PYTHIA MC tune and of the underlying matrix-element generator.",

            "text": "The Z/\u03b3 * + jets cross sections are measured using the midpoint algorithm for the reconstruction of the jets in the final state. The midpoint algorithm belongs to the class of iterative cone algorithms. Though they present several experimental advantages, iterative cone algorithms are not infrared and collinear safe, which means that the number of hard jets found by such jet algorithms is sensitive to a collinear splitting or to the addition of a soft emission. In particular the midpoint jet algorithm used in this measurement is infrared unsafe, as divergences appear in a fixed-order calculation for configurations with three hard particles close in phase space plus a soft one, as discussed in Refs. [55,57]. In order to compare the measured cross sections with a fixed-order prediction, an infrared and collinear safe jet algorithm that is as similar as possible to the midpoint algorithm, is used in the prediction. This is the SISCone algorithm with the same splitmerge threshold of 0.75 and the same jet radius R = 0.7 of the midpoint algorithm used for the measured cross sections. The additional uncertainty coming from the use of different jet algorithms between data and theory is estimated by comparing the particle-level cross sections for the two jet algorithms. Figure 6 shows the cross section ratios of midpoint and SIS-Cone jet algorithms for inclusive jet p T and rapidity in the Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final state. The difference at parton level between SISCone and midpoint is between 2% and 3%. Larger differences between midpoint and SISCone are observed if the underlying event is simulated; however, they do not affect the comparison with fixed-order predictions. Figure 7 shows the same comparison as a function of jet multiplicity. The difference at parton level between midpoint and SISCone is always below 3% and generally uniform.",

Such a difference is not observed in the comparison with LO-ME+PS ALPGEN+PYTHIA and NLO+PS POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions, in agreement with recent measurements using the anti-k t jet algorithm [4], which do not  show any difference with the NLO predictions at high jet multiplicities. The reason of this difference has been found to be related to the different \u2206R angular reach [57] between the SISCone and anti-k t algorithms, and how it is influenced by additional radiation between two hard particles [49]. The difference between data or LO-ME+PS with respect to the NLO prediction in the Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jets final state is explained with the presence of higher-order QCD radiation, which reduces the angular reach of the SISCone algorithm and increases the cross section in this particular configuration. Figures 9 and 10 show the leading-jet and inclusive-jet cross sections differential in p T for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events. Table VI shows the inclusive-jet cross sections differential in p T for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events. All the theoretical predictions are in reasonable agreement with the measured cross sections. The NLO electroweak corrections give a 5% negative contribution in the last Z/\u03b3 * and leading jet p T bin, due to the large Sudakov logarithms that appear in the virtual part of the calculation [10]. The scale-variation uncertainty is quite independent of the jet p T and of the order of 4% \u2212 6% for  the nNLO LOOPSIM prediction. Figure 11 shows variations in the MCFM prediction with different values of the stronginteraction coupling constant at the Z boson mass, \u03b1 s (M Z ), factorization scale, PDF sets, and choice of the functional form of the factorization and renormalization scales. Figure 12 and Tab. VII show the inclusive-jet cross sections differential in rapidity for Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events. All predictions correctly model this quantity. In the high-rapidity region the measured cross section is higher than predictions; however, the difference is covered by the uncertainty due to the contribution of multiple pp interaction. The nNLO LOOP-SIM+MCFM prediction has the lowest scale-variation theoretical uncertainty, which is of the order of 4% \u2212 6%, and the PDF uncertainty is between 2% and 4%. In the high-rapidity region the ALPGEN prediction is lower than other theoretical models; however, the difference with data is covered by the large CKKW renormalization scale-variation uncertainty of this prediction. Figure 13 shows variations in the MCFM prediction with different values of \u03b1 s (M Z ), factorization scale, PDF sets, and choice of the functional form of the factorization and renormalization scales. Figure 14 shows the production cross section differential in p T (Z/\u03b3 * ) for the Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final state. The perturbative QCD fixed-order calculations MCFM and LOOPSIM+MCFM fail in describing the region below the 30 GeV/c jet p T threshold, where multiple-jet emission and nonperturbative QCD corrections are significant. The low Z/\u03b3 * p T region is better described by the ALPGEN+PYTHIA and POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions, which include parton shower radiation, and in which the nonperturbative QCD corrections are applied as part of the PYTHIA MC event evolution. In the intermediate Z/\u03b3 * p T region, the ratios of the data over the NLO MCFM,  NLO+PS POWHEG+PYTHIA and nNLO LOOPSIM+MCFM predictions show a slightly concave shape, which is covered by the scale-variation uncertainty. The NLO electroweak corrections related to the large Sudakov logarithms are negative and of the order of 5% in the last p T bin. Figure 15 shows the differential cross section as a function of the Z/\u03b3 * -leading jet \u2206\u03c6 variable in Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events. The ALPGEN+PYTHIA prediction shows good agreement with the measured cross section in the region \u2206\u03c6 \u03c0/2.",

The NLO MCFM prediction fails to describe the region \u2206\u03c6 < \u03c0/2 because it does not include the Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jets configuration, whereas nNLO LOOP-SIM+MCFM, which includes the Z/\u03b3 * + 3 jets with only LO accuracy, predicts a rate approximately 2-3 times smaller than the rate observed in data in this region.",

The most remarkable example is the H jet T , defined as H jet T = \u2211 p jet T , in Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet events. Figure 16 shows the measured cross section as a function of H jet T compared to the available theoretical predictions. The NLO MCFM prediction fails to describe the shape of the H jet T distribution, in particular it underestimates the measured cross section in the high H jet T region, where the NLO-to-LO K-factor is greater than approximately two and a larger NLO scale-variation uncertainty is observed. The LO-ME+PS ALPGEN+PYTHIA prediction is in good agreement with data, but suffers for the large LO scale uncertainty. The POWHEG+PYTHIA prediction also is in good agreement with data, but is still affected by the larger NLO scale-variation uncertainty in the high p T tail. The nNLO LOOPSIM+MCFM prediction provides a good modeling of the data distribution, and shows a significantly reduced scale-variation uncertainty.",

Figures 17 and 18 show the measured cross section as a function of the 2nd leading jet p T and inclusive jet rapidity compared to ALPGEN+PYTHIA and BLACKHAT+SHERPA predictions. Measured distributions are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Figure 19 shows the measured cross section as a function of the dijet mass, M jj . The cross section in the first bin is overestimated by the MCFM prediction, but correctly described by the ALPGEN+PYTHIA prediction. In the M jj region above approximately 160 GeV/c 2 , the measured cross sections are 10% \u2212 20% higher than both predictions. However, the systematic uncertainty, mainly due to the jet-energy scale, is as large as the observed difference. Figure 20 shows the mea- sured cross section as a function of the dijet \u2206R compared to ALPGEN+PYTHIA and MCFM predictions. Some differences between data and theory are observed at high \u2206R, where the measured cross section is approximately 50% higher than the theoretical predictions. The dijet \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206y differential cross sections also are measured, and the results are shown in Figs. 21 and 22. The dijet \u2206\u03c6 appears reasonably modeled by the ALPGEN+PYTHIA and MCFM predictions, whereas the dijet \u2206y shows a shape difference, which reaches 50% at \u2206y = 3 \u2212 3.6, and is related to the observed difference between data and theory at \u2206R 4. This region is affected by large experimental uncertainties, mainly due to the pile-up subtraction, and large theoretical uncertainty. Figure 23 shows the measured cross section as a function of the dihedral angle \u03b8 Z,jj between the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 decay plane and the jet-jet plane [59].

            "text": "The analysis of the full proton-antiproton collisions sample collected with the CDF II detector in Run II of the Tevatron, corresponding to 9.6 fb \u22121 integrated luminosity, allows for precise measurements of Z/\u03b3 * + jets in- 30 GeV/c, |y jet | 2.1, and \u2206R \u2212jet 0.7, with jets reconstructed using the midpoint algorithm in a radius R = 0.7. The measured cross sections are unfolded to the particle level and the decay channels combined. Results are compared with the most recent theoretical predictions, which properly model the measured differential cross sections in Z/\u03b3 * + 1, 2, and 3 jets final states. The main experimental uncertainty is related to the jet-energy scale, whereas the largest uncertainty of the theoretical predictions is generally associated with the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales. Among perturbative QCD predictions, LOOP-SIM+MCFM shows the lowest scale-variation uncertainty and, therefore, gives the most accurate cross-section prediction for the Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final state. The MCFM and BLACK-HAT+SHERPA fixed-order NLO predictions are in reasonable agreement with the data in the Z/\u03b3 * + 1, 2, and 3 jets final states. The ALPGEN+PYTHIA prediction provides a good modeling of differential distributions for all jets multiplicities. The POWHEG+PYTHIA prediction, due to the NLO accuracy of the matrix elements and to the inclusion of nonperturbative QCD effects, provides precise modeling of Z/\u03b3 * + 1 jet final states both in the low-and high-p T kinematic regions. The effect of NLO electroweak virtual corrections to the Z/\u03b3 * + jet production is studied and included in the comparison with the measured cross sections: in the high p T kinematic region, corrections are of the order of 5%, which is comparable with the accuracy of predictions at higher order than NLO. The large theoretical uncertainty associated with the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales suggests that the inclusion of higher order QCD corrections, by mean of exact or approximate calculations, will improve the theoretical modeling of Z/\u03b3 * + jets processes.",

The measured cross section (black dots) is compared to the BLACKHAT+SHERPA NLO prediction (open circles). The black vertical bars show the statistical uncertainty, and the yellow bands show the total systematic uncertainty, except for the 5.8% uncertainty on the luminosity. The lower panels show the data-to-theory ratio, with the blue dashed bands showing the scale-variation uncertainty, which is associated with the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales \u00b5.",
