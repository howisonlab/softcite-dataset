Five single-spin and three double-spin azimuthal asymmetries were measured in the range of photon virtuality 1 (GeV/c) 2 < Q 2 < 10 (GeV/c) 2 , Bjorken scaling variable 0.003 < x Bj < 0.3 and transverse momentum squared of the \u03c9 meson 0.05 (GeV/c) 2 < p 2 T < 0.5 (GeV/c) 2 . The measured asymmetries are sensitive to the nucleon helicity-flip Generalised Parton Distributions (GPD) E that are related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks, the chiral-odd GPDs H T that are related to the transversity Parton Distribution Functions, and the sign of the \u03c0\u03c9 transition form factor. The results are compared to recent calculations of a GPD-based model.",

            "text": "Hard exclusive meson production (HEMP) in charged lepton scattering off nucleons plays an important role in studies of the nucleon structure in terms of its constituents, i.e. quarks and gluons. Interest in studying HEMP as well as deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) has increased recently as this allows access to generalised parton distributions (GPDs) [1][2][3][4][5], which offer a comprehensive description of the partonic structure of the nucleon. In particular, GPDs provide a picture of the nucleon as an extended object [6][7][8]. In this picture, which is often referred to as 3-dimensional nucleon tomography, longitudinal momenta and transverse spatial degrees of freedom of partons are correlated. Constraining GPDs may also yield an insight into angular momenta of quarks, which represent another fundamental property of the nucleon [2,3]. The mapping of nucleon GPDs, which became one of the key objectives of hadron physics, requires a comprehensive programme of measuring hard exclusive production of photons and various mesons in a broad kinematic range.",

            "text": "The amplitude for hard exclusive meson production by longitudinally polarised virtual photons was proven to factorise into a hard scattering part that is calculable in perturbative QCD (pQCD) and a soft part [4,9]. The soft part contains GPDs that describe the structure of the target nucleon and a distribution amplitude (DA), which accounts for the structure of the produced meson. The factorisation holds in the limit of large photon virtuality Q 2 and large invariant mass W of the virtual-photon nucleon system, but fixed x Bj , and for |t|/Q 2 1. Here, t is the squared four-momentum transfer to the proton and x Bj = Q 2 /(2M p \u03bd), where \u03bd is the energy of the virtual photon in the lab frame and M p is the proton mass. This factorisation is referred to as 'collinear' because parton transverse momenta are neglected. No similar proof of factorisation exists for transversely polarised virtual photons. However, phenomenological pQCD-inspired models have been proposed [10][11][12][13] that go beyond the collinear factorisation by postulating the so-called 'k \u22a5 factorisation', where k \u22a5 denotes the parton transverse momentum. In the model of Refs. [11][12][13][14][15], hereafter referred to as 'GK' model, cross sections and spin-density matrix ele-ments (SDMEs) for HEMP by both longitudinal and transverse virtual photons can be described simultaneously.",

These GPDs are of special interest as they are related to the total angular momentum carried by partons in the nucleon [2]. When higher-twist effects are included in the DA, the chiral-odd GPDs H f T and E f T appear, which describe the process amplitude with helicity flip of the exchanged quark. They are also referred to as 'transverse' GPDs. While parameterisations of GPDs H f over the presently accessible x Bj range are well constrained by existing measurements of DVCS and HEMP, much less experimental results exist that allow one to constrain the other mentioned GPDs. For references to measurements relevant for constraining GPDs H f and E f see e.g. the introductory sections in Refs. [16,17]. Depending on quark content and quantum numbers of the meson, the soft part of the process amplitude contains specific combinations of flavour-dependent quark GPDs and gluon GPDs [18][19][20]. Because of this property HEMP can be regarded as a quark flavour filter, which motivates the study of a wide spectrum of mesons.",

[13] predicts a sizable value of approximately \u22120.1 for the \u03c9 channel in contrast to a small value predicted for the \u03c1 0 channel. Thus the measurement of this asymmetry in both channels will provide additional constraints, which may help to separate the valence quarks contributions E u and E d . Secondly, it is known since a long time that pion exchange can play an important role in photo-and leptoproduction of \u03c9 mesons [21]. The recent HERMES measurements of SDMEs for exclusive electroproduction of \u03c9 mesons [22] indicate a sizable contribution of the unnaturalparity-exchange processes in the covered energy range. In the framework of the GK model it was shown [15] that the pion-pole exchange is important to reproduce HERMES results on SDMEs. Still, SDME data do not allow to distinguish the sign of the \u03c0\u03c9 transition form factor. Certain azimuthal asymmetries for \u03c9 production are sensitive to the pion-pole contribution and hence in principle could allow the determination of its sign. Although the effect of the pion-pole decreases with increasing W , it might still be measurable beyond experimental uncertainties at COMPASS. For other vector mesons the effect is expected to be very small (\u03c1 0 production) or negligible (\u03c6 production) [15].",

The general formula for the cross section for meson leptoproduction can be found in Ref. [23]. The angle \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle between the lepton plane that is spanned by the momenta of the incoming and the scattered leptons, and the hadron plane that is spanned by the momenta of the virtual photon and the meson (see Fig. 1). The angle \u03c6 s is the azimuthal angle between the lepton plane and the spin direction of the target nucleon. The polarisation of the lepton beam is denoted by P . The component of the transverse target spin perpendicular to the virtual-photon direction, S T , is approximated in the COMPASS kinematic region by the corresponding component perpendicular to the direction of the incoming muon, P T . According to Ref. [23], the transition from S T to P T introduces in Eq. (1) a dependence on \u03b8 , which is the angle between the directions of virtual photon and incoming beam particle. This dependence gives rise to additional asymmetries of the cross section that are related to longitudinal target polarisation. These asymmetries are suppressed by the factor sin \u03b8 , which is small at COMPASS kinematics (sin \u03b8 \u2248 0.056 on average). In the present analysis the effect of the angle \u03b8 is neglected.",

The central cell is 60 cm long and the two outer ones are 30 cm long. The spin directions in neighbouring cells are opposite. Such a target configuration allows for a simultaneous measurement of azimuthal asymmetries for the two target spin directions without relying on beam flux measurements. Systematic effects due to acceptance are reduced by reversing the spin directions on a weekly basis. With the three-cell configuration, the average acceptance for cells with opposite spin direction is approximately the same, which leads to a further reduction of systematic uncertainties.",

The sum runs over all nuclei present in the COMPASS target. The ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a given nucleus to the cross section on the proton is denoted by \u03c3 A /\u03c3 p . The inclusion of the effect of nuclear shadowing on the calculation of the dilution factor is crucial for the ammonia target. However, this effect has never been measured for exclusive \u03c9 production in a kinematic region comparable to that covered by the COMPASS experiment. Therefore, we assume that the nuclear shadowing effect for \u03c9 is the same as that for \u03c1 0 . This assumption is supported by similar quark compo-sitions, quantum numbers (J P ) and masses of both mesons. The assumption leads to the same dilution factor as for \u03c1 0 , the evaluation of which is detailed in Ref. [25]. For the NH 3 target, which is used for the present analysis, the dilution factor amounts typically to 0.25 [16]. The COMPASS spectrometer is designed to reconstruct scattered muons and produced hadrons in wide momentum and angular ranges. It consists of two stages, each equipped with a dipole magnet, to measure tracks with large and small momenta, respectively. In the highflux region, in or close to the beam, tracking is provided by stations of scintillating fibres, silicon detectors, micromesh gaseous chambers and gas electron multiplier chambers. Large-angle tracking devices are multiwire proportional chambers, drift chambers and straw detectors. Muons are identified in large-area mini drift tubes and drift tubes placed downstream of hadron absorbers. Each stage of the spectrometer contains an electromagnetic and a hadron calorimeter. The identification of charged particles is possible with a RICH detector, although in this analysis it is not used.",

The reason is that in the COMPASS kinematic region and for the set-up without detection of the recoil particle, p 2 T is determined with a precision better by a factor of two to five. In addition, the t distribution is distorted because t 0 , which depends on W , Q 2 , M \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and M 2 X , is poorly determined for non-exclusive background events [29]. The p 2 T distribution shown in Fig. 6 indicates at small p 2 T values a contribution from coherent \u03c9 production on target nuclei. Coherent events are suppressed by applying the lower limit given by Eq. (16). A study of p 2 T distributions shows that in addition to exclusive coherent and incoherent \u03c9 production a third component, which originates from non-exclusive background, is also present and its contribution increases with p 2 T , thus requiring also an upper limit. Therefore, in order to select the sample of events from incoherent exclusive \u03c9 production, the afore mentioned p 2 T limits are applied.",

In such a case, non-zero values of azimuthal asymmetries would indicate an experimental bias. In particular, false asymmetries provide a test of validity of the reasonable assumption, see Eq. 25, i.e. whether during data taking the acceptance has changed in a way that influences the extraction of asymmetries. False asymmetries are determined in two ways: by using the data from the upstream and downstream cells, as well as by the artificial division of the central cell into two 30 cm subcells. This test is performed without separation into signal and background asymmetries, and independently for the ranges |E miss | < 3 GeV and \u22123 GeV < E miss < 20 GeV. The resulting false asymmetries are found to be consistent with zero within statistical uncertainties. Nevertheless, an upper limit on the false asymmetries is estimated to be 0.01 [26] at the level of raw asymmetries defined in Eq. (23). This estimate represents a conservative limit for breaking the reasonable assumption given by Eq. (25). At the level of physics asymmetries, this estimation yields typically a systematic uncertainty on the level of 20% of the statistical one.",

It is checked whether the unbinned maximum likelihood estimator returns the introduced asymmetry correctly.

            "text": "However, the interpretation of \u03c9 results in the context of the GPD formalism is more challenging than that for \u03c1 0 , as exclusive \u03c9 meson production is significantly influenced by the pion-pole exchange contribution, and at present the sign of \u03c0\u03c9 transition form factor is unknown. By comparing the COMPASS results with the calculations of the GK model (see Fig. 8 (right) The single-spin azimuthal asymmetries for \u03c9 production on transversely polarised protons were measured also by the HERMES collaboration [34]. They conclude that these data seem to favour the positive \u03c0\u03c9 form factor, although within large experimental uncertainties. A direct comparison of published asymmetry values measured in both experiments in not straightforward, because the HERMES definition of physics asymmetries differs from that given in Eq. (4). Such comparison is only possible for the asymmetry A sin(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6 S ) UT . The results from both experiments are shown as a function of t in Fig. 9 indicating their compatibility within experimental uncertainties. Note that the COMPASS results cover a wider kinematic range and they have smaller uncertainties, for example for the asymmetry A sin(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6 S ) UT by a factor larger than two. for exclusive \u03c9 muoproduction measured by the COMPASS (filled circles) and HERMES [34] (open squares) collaborations as a function of t . The curves show the predictions of the GPD-based model [15] given for the average Q 2 and W values of the COMPASS (solid lines) and HERMES (dashed lines) data. For each set of curves, the upper (blue) and lower (red) ones are for the negative and positive \u03c0\u03c9 form factors, respectively, while the middle (black) one represents the predictions without the pion pole.
