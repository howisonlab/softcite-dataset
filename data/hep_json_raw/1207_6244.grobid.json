In particular, they are used to determine the weak mixing parameters |V qb | (q = c, u), complementing the measurements of CP asymmetries used to verify the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism of the SM [1]. The tension at the level of 2 standard deviations (\u03c3) between the values of |V qb | extracted from inclusive and exclusive B decays [2], as well as some discrepancies between measurements and theoretical expectations for semileptonic B decays to excited charmed mesons, may indicate problems in the theoretical tools or in the interpretation of the experimental results.",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber, a system of aerogel Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillation counters and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field.

The combined B \u2212 \u2192 D ( * )+ s K \u2212 \u2212\u03bd decay modes are observed with a significance of 6\u03c3 to be B(B \u2212 \u2192 D ( * )+ s K \u2212 \u2212\u03bd ) = (0.59 \u00b1 0.12(stat) \u00b1 0.15(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The branching fraction results are consistent with the measurement of BaBar [6]. We also present the first measurement of the D + s K \u2212 invariant mass distribution, which is dominated by a prominent peak around 2.6 GeV/c 2 , possibly from excited D mesons decays.",

Figure 3 shows the invariant mass distribution of the D + s K \u2212 system, M DsK , for the combined D s and D * s samples in the signal window and in the X mis sidebands. Superimposed histograms represent the expected backgrounds. While the background model describes the experimental M DsK distribution well in the X mis sidebands, a clear excess over the expected background is seen in the signal region. The M DsK distribution in the signal window is dominated by a prominent peak at \u2248 2.6 GeV/c 2 , similarly to that observed in B \u2212 \u2192 D + s K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 decays [14]. The signal yields are extracted from a simultaneous, extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the D s and D * s samples, consisting of 2175 and 396 events, respectively.
