No evidence of an excess of events relative to the standard model expectations is observed. For a W boson described by the sequential standard model, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction and lower limits are established on the new boson mass. Masses below 4.1 TeV are excluded combining electron and muon decay channels, significantly improving upon the results obtained with the 8 TeV data. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the W production cross section and branching fraction are also derived in combination with the 8 TeV data. Finally, exclusion limits are set for the production of generic W bosons decaying into this final state using a model-independent approach.",

It is assumed that there is no interference between the production of the new particle and the production of the SM W boson. This would be the case, for example, if the W interacts via V + A coupling. Its decays to SM bosons (W, Z, H), which are model dependent, are neglected. Dedicated searches for W decays into bosons can be found in Refs. [2][3][4].",

Forward calorimeters extend the \u03b7 coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors (3 < |\u03b7| < 5). Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid, in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Additional detectors and upgraded electronics, installed before the beginning of the 13 TeV data collection period in 2015, have yielded improved reconstruction performance for muons relative to the 8 TeV data collection period in 2012.",

The K factor varies from 1.3 to 1.1 for the range of W masses studied in this analysis, namely from 0.4 to 5.8 TeV. The NNLO corrections decrease with W boson masses up to around 4.5 TeV. For higher W masses, the phase space for production in pp collisions at 13 TeV decreases, leading to a growing fraction of new bosons produced off mass-shell, towards lower masses.

Requirements for identifying good quality and energetic leptons are applied, optimized for high-p T values where the analysis has the largest sensitivity to the expected signals. Events containing calorimeter noise or large E miss T due to instrumental effects, such as beam halo or jets near nonfunctioning channels in the calorimeters [30], are not used. The primary vertex in the event is defined as the vertex with the highest p 2 T , where the sum is over the tracks associated to it. Electrons are reconstructed from electromagnetic energy deposits (clusters) in the ECAL acceptance region (barrel, |\u03b7| < 1.444, endcaps, 1.566 < |\u03b7| < 2.5) matched to a track in the silicon tracker [31]. The transverse energy of a localized cluster is defined as E T = E sin \u03b8 , with \u03b8 the polar angle relative to the beam axis, and where the cluster energy E includes any deposits consistent with bremsstrahlung emission. The electron identification, optimized for high-p T values [32,33], includes requirements on the isolation and on the variables describing the electromagnetic shower shape. The electron isolation is computed using the sum of three terms, based on tracker, ECAL, and HCAL information, after correction for the contributions expected from detector noise and pileup. The electron isolation in the tracker is ensured by requiring the scalar p T sum of all tracks, within a cone of R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.3 centered around the track of the electron candidate and originating from the primary vertex, to be less than 5 GeV. The ECAL isolation is defined as the E T sum of the energy deposits within a cone of R = 0.3 around the electron candidate to be less than 3% of the electron E T . The HCAL isolation considers the sum of energy deposits in the hadronic calorimeter within a cone of R = 0.15 around the electron direction which must be less than 5% of the electron energy deposit in the ECAL. In each case the sums exclude the electron candidate itself. In order to differentiate between electrons and photon conversions, the electron track is required to have no more than one hit missing in the pixel layers, and the transverse distance to the primary vertex must be less than 0.02 (0.05) cm in the barrel (endcap). The electron momenta for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays are estimated by combining energy measurements in the ECAL with momentum measurements in the tracker. For high-energy electrons the momentum scale and resolution are dominated entirely by the energy measurement in the ECAL. The discriminating variable in this search, M T , is more sensitive to variations of energy scale than to uncertainty in energy resolution. The energy scale has therefore been checked using high-mass offshell dielectron events coming from Z-boson decays.",

Since consecutive layers in the muon system are separated by thick layers of steel, the latter requirement significantly reduces the amount of hadronic punch-through. To reduce background from cosmic ray muons, each muon is required to have a transverse impact parameter less than 0.02 cm and a longitudinal distance parameter less than 0.5 cm. Both parameters are defined relative to the primary vertex. In order to suppress muons with mismeasured p T , an additional requirement \u03c3 p T /p T < 0.3 is applied, where \u03c3 p T is the uncertainty in the p T from the track reconstruction. Muon isolation requires that the scalar p T sum of all tracks originating from the interaction vertex within a cone of R = 0.3 around its direction, excluding the muon track, be less than 10% of the muon p T . The muon p T reconstruction is optimized for the high-p T region and its performance has been studied using both high-energy cosmic ray muons and dimuons from high-p T Z boson decays [33]. The relative p T resolution for muons with p T < 200 GeV is 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps.

Studies are performed on the curvature of muon tracks in different regions of \u03b7 and \u03c6 using high-p T cosmic ray data and dimuon events from collisions, together with the corresponding simulation samples. They indicate the absence of a significant curvature bias. The uncertainties associated with these results are taken as contributions to the overall systematic uncertainties. For the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.2) the bias uncertainty is 0.03/TeV and in the forward region (1.2 < |\u03b7| < 2.4) the bias uncertainty is 0.04/TeV. These uncertainties are propagated to the muon p T assignment and consequently, to the M T distribution. The p T resolution at high-p T values in data is well reproduced by the simulation and no further correction is applied. Muon trigger and identification efficiencies measured in data are consistent with those from simulated samples within the precision of the efficiency measurement allowed by the amount of data collected at high p T . Uncertainties on the extrapolation to high p T values are assigned, which increase from 3% for p T < 500 GeV to 8.5% for p T > 1 TeV. The sources of uncertainty in the lepton p T translate directly into the E miss T calculation, which in the sample of events selected is mainly determined by the high p T of the lepton. As events are allowed to include an arbitrary number of jets, which may originate from initial state radiation, systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are propagated to the E miss T variable. Common to both the electron and muon channels are the uncertainties on the total integrated luminosity (2.7%) [36] and in the reweighting procedure applied to simulated samples to match the pileup in data (5%). The application of K factors accounting for higher-order corrections, both for the signals and the background, is also affected by systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty in the signal K factor arises from the choice of PDF and \u03b1 S . The combined uncertainty is evaluated using the PDF4LHC prescription [37], where in the computation of each PDF set the strong factor, a uniform uncertainty of 5%, stemming from the NNLO corrections, is applied in addition to a mass-dependent uncertainty. The latter is determined by comparing the results from the two possible procedures for combining the QCD and electroweak corrections: additive or factorized methods [7]. The theoretical uncertainty related to the choice of the PDF set in the background modeling is estimated using the PDF4LHC prescription and dominates the total uncertainty at high M T in both decay channels.

These results can be combined with the present analysis using the prescription from Ref. [39]. The systematic uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated between Run 1 and Run 2. The 95% CL limits on the product \u03c3 W B(W \u2192 \u03bd) derived from the combination of data at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV are presented in Fig. 6 for the electron (upper) and the muon (lower) decay channels. In this case, the cross sections are presented relative to the predicted NNLO cross section for the SSM W production at each center-ofmass energy. The sensitivity to exclude high-mass W bosons is dominated by the data set at \u221a s = 13 TeV, and these data determine the limit exclusively for masses above 4 TeV. For W masses below 2.2 TeV, the higher integrated luminosity data set from the 8 TeV Run still makes the biggest contribution to the sensitivity. Considering both data sets, SSM W bosons with masses less than 3.7 (3.9) TeV are excluded in the electron (muon) channel. Combining both final state channels using the data at both centerof-mass energies the production of SSM W bosons with masses below 4.1 TeV is excluded at 95% CL.",

No deviation from the background expectations has been observed and exclusion limits at 95% confidence level have been extracted on the mass of a W boson. Masses below 3.6 (3.9) TeV are excluded in the electron (muon) decay channel analysis, significantly improving upon the results obtained with the \u221a s = 8 TeV data. This search has been combined with the earlier one conducted at 8 TeV, where the sensitivity of the search is dominated by the 13 TeV data, yielding a lower mass limit of 4.1 TeV for W bosons when combining data from both decay channels and center-of-mass energies. Finally, generic limits on the production of W resonances with the same leptonic final states have been obtained using a model-independent approach.",
