It is based on proton-proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. The search is sensitive to diboson resonance production via vector-boson fusion as well as quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the Standard Model backgrounds. Several benchmark models are used to interpret the results. Limits on the production cross section are set for a new narrow scalar resonance, a new heavy vector-boson and a spin-2 Kaluza-Klein graviton.",

Searches for diboson resonances in various decay channels have been carried out by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but no evidence of such resonances has been observed [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The most recent ATLAS searches using data collected in 2015 and 2016 have been performed in the ZZ/ZW final state [17], with one Z decaying to leptons, and the fully hadronic final state with boson-tagged jets [18].",

The search uses pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016. The strategy for identification of resonances depends on the ability to resolve the quarks from the hadronically decaying V boson. For high-mass resonances, the opening angles between the quarks from V boson decays are small and both quarks can be identified as a single jet. This case is referred to as the merged analysis and is denoted by \u03bdJ. In",

The ID consists of a silicon pixel detector including a newly installed innermost layer called the insertable B-layer [23], a silicon microstrip detector and a straw-tube tracker. It is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides precision tracking of charged particles with pseudorapidity 1 |\u03b7| < 2.5. The straw-tube tracker also provides transition radiation measurements for electron identification. The calorimeter system comprises finely segmented sampling calorimeters using lead/liquid-argon for the detection of EM showers up to |\u03b7| = 3.2, and (copper or tungsten)/liquid-argon for hadronic showers for 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. In the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7), a steel/scintillator hadronic calorimeter is used. Outside the calorimeters, the muon system incorporates multiple layers of trigger and tracking chambers in a magnetic field produced by a system of superconducting toroids, enabling an independent precise JHEP03(2018)042 measurement of muon track momenta for |\u03b7| < 2.7. The ATLAS detector has a two-level trigger system that is based on custom hardware followed by a software trigger to reduce the selected event rate to approximately 1 kHz for offline analysis [24].",

Model A, with a strength of the vector-boson interaction g V = 1, is typical of an extended gauge model [35] with the heavy vectors having comparable branching ratios into fermions and gauge bosons. Model B, with g V = 3, is representative of composite Higgs models, where the fermionic couplings are suppressed [36][37][38]. In both scenarios, the resonance width is narrower than the detector resolution. The HVT VBF Model samples were generated with the coupling to fermions set to zero, and the couplings to gauge bosons similar to those of Model A. The signal samples were produced in a mass range from 300 GeV to 5000 GeV using Mad-Graph5 aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [39] interfaced to Pythia 8.186 with the NNPDF23 lo [40] PDF and the A14 tune [41] for the underlying event.",

Additional sources of SM background include the production of top quarks, multijets, dibosons and Z+jets. Events containing W or Z bosons with associated jets were simulated using the Sherpa 2.2.1 [44] generator with the NNPDF30 nnlo [45] PDF. Matrix elements were calculated for up to 2 partons at NLO and 4 partons at LO using Comix [46] and OpenLoops [47] and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [48] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [49]. To estimate systematic uncertainties related to the V +jets processes, alternative samples were generated using MadGraph5 aMC@NLO JHEP03(2018)042 2.2.2 interfaced to the Pythia 8.186 parton shower model, using the A14 tune together with the NNPDF23 lo PDF. For the generation of tt and single top quarks the Powheg-Box 2 [50] generator with the CT10 PDF in the matrix element calculations was used. Systematic uncertainties associated with showering and hadronization are evaluated using alternative Powheg-Box samples interfaced with Herwig++ 2.7.1 [51] and using the UEEE5 underlying event tune [52]. Additional systematic uncertainties related to the shape of the W V mass are computed using alternative samples generated by Mad-Graph5 aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [39] with the CT10 PDF. Diboson samples (W W , W Z and ZZ) were generated using Sherpa 2.2.1 with the CT10 PDF. Additional diboson events using the Powheg-Box generator, interfaced to the Pythia 8.186 parton shower model, were generated for the purpose of estimating systematic uncertainties. The CT10NLO set was used for the PDF of the hard-scatter process and the CTEQ6L1 PDF was used for the parton shower. All the background cross sections were computed to the next-tonext-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [53][54][55][56][57], except for the diboson samples for which the generator cross sections at NLO are used. EvtGen 1.2.0 [58] was used for simulating the bottom and charm hadron decays, except for samples generated by Sherpa. The multijet background estimation relies purely on data-driven techniques.",

Single-electron triggers with minimum transverse energy (E T ) thresholds of 24 GeV and 26 GeV in 2015 and 2016, as well as 60 GeV are applied to record events in the electron final state. The low threshold triggers require electron candidates to pass isolation requirements resulting in at least 90% efficiency, depending on the lepton p T . As for the muon final state, the events are recorded either by a single-muon trigger or an E miss T triggers. The single-muon trigger, with p T > 20 (26) GeV in 2015 (2016), is subject to a large inefficiency due to limited trigger hardware coverage. The E miss T trigger has an online threshold of 70 GeV for the 2015 data and of 90-110 GeV for the 2016 data, where the muon track p T is not used to compute E miss T in the trigger algorithm. Therefore, it is fully efficient for W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd with p T (W ) > 200 GeV and it is used in the merged analysis, where a high-p T lepton is expected, to recover the single-muon trigger inefficiency. Events recorded by single-lepton triggers, where the signal lepton matches the trigger lepton, and E miss T triggers are selected. The sensitivity to resonances of different masses is optimized by classifying the events according to the topology, production mechanism and amount of background. The event selection criteria are summarized in tables 1 and 2 for the merged and resolved analyses respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the jet selections used to reconstruct the hadronically decaying V boson candidates in the signal and control regions of the analysis. The mass of either the large-R jet (m J ) or the system of two small-R jets (m jj ) is used to define \"mass windows\".",

The latter requirement rejects more than 70% of background events from tt production while keeping more than 95% of signal events, independently of the resonance mass. The remaining events are assigned to the high-purity (HP) region if the large-R jet satisfies the V -tagging 50% efficiency working point, for both the mass window and the D 2 variable, as defined in section 4. Otherwise, events are assigned to the low-purity (LP) region if the 80% efficiency working point is satisfied for the large-R jet. The improvement in cross-section sensitivity resulting from combining the HP and LP regions reaches up to 36% for resonances with 5.0 TeV mass. The selected HP and LP events can simultaneously pass both the W W and the W Z selections if the large-R jet passes both the W and Z selections. cally decaying V candidate is formed by combining the two small-R jets, excluding VBF tag-jets, with the highest p T and requiring their invariant mass to be between 66 and 94 (82 and 106) GeV in order to be consistent with the W (Z) boson mass. The two selected small-R jets are required to have p T > 45 GeV (60 GeV for the highest p T jet) and the azimuthal angle separation between jets, lepton and E miss T directions must satisfy \u2206\u03c6(j, ) > 1.0, \u2206\u03c6(j, E miss T ) > 1.0, \u2206\u03c6(j, j) < 1.5 and \u2206\u03c6( , E miss T ) < 1.5. In the calculation of the W V invariant mass, a V mass constraint is imposed on the two small-R jets by rescaling the p T of the dijet system to be p jj T \u00d7 m(V )/m(jj), where p jj T and m(jj) are the transverse momentum and the invariant mass of the dijet system respectively, and m(V ) is the known value of the V boson mass. Studies using MC simulated events show that the mass constraint reduces the uncertainties due to the jet energy scale and results in an approximately 20% improvement of the resolution of the reconstructed diboson resonance mass, which ranges between 20 GeV and 120 GeV across the mass spectrum.

The leakage occurs due to inefficiencies related to the reconstruction and identification of the \"tag\" jets, and results in a small deterioration in sensitivity after accounting for the background. Concerning the \u00d7 A of the various analyses, the resolved analysis is more sensitive in the low mass region, while the merged analysis is more efficient in the high mass region with a relatively constant \u00d7 A.

The analysis is carried out in two different kinematic topologies of the hadronically decaying W/Z boson, which can be reconstructed either as two small-R jets or one large-R jet. The data are compatible with the Standard Model background hypothesis and the largest local excess observed is approximately 2.7 \u03c3, which is not significant. Limits on the production cross section are obtained as a function of the resonance mass for models predicting a narrow scalar boson, a heavy spin-1 vector boson and a spin-2 KK graviton. Two different production modes are considered, the vector-boson fusion and the gluon-gluon fusion or quark-antiquark annihilation, and independent limits are set. Masses below 2730 GeV and 3000 GeV are excluded at 95% CL for the Z in models A and B of the HVT parametrization, respectively. For the W resonance, the corresponding limits obtained exclude masses below 2800 GeV and 2990 GeV. Additionally, RS G KK signals with k/M Pl = 1.0 produced via gluon-gluon fusion are excluded at 95% CL below 1750 GeV. This search has significantly extended previous ATLAS high-mass limits [  Table 4. Dominant relative uncertainties in the signal-strength parameter (\u00b5) of hypothesized HVT signal production with m(Z ) = 1200 GeV and m(W ) = 500 GeV in the VBF category, and m(W ) = 2000 GeV and m(Z ) = 500 GeV in the ggF/qq category, assuming that the production cross sections equal the expected 95% CL upper limits of 0.012 pb, 0.7 pb, 0.005 pb and 0.5 pb, respectively. The impact of the several other sources of systematic uncertainty remains significant, however they are not included in the table as subdominant with respect to those quoted. The effect of the statistical uncertainty on the signal and background samples is also shown. The large-R jet kinematic uncertainties arise from jet-related reconstruction uncertainties that can be dominant in the low m(W V ) region because of the merged analysis priority in the event categorization. The scale uncertainty of the tt background includes the uncertainties of the factorization and renormalization scales of the nominal generator. The scale uncertainty of the W +jets background includes the uncertainties in the renormalization and factorization scales, the CKKW matching scales, and the resummation scale. The cross section uncertainties for the W +jets and tt backgrounds are constrained by the statistical uncertainty of the corresponding control data.",
