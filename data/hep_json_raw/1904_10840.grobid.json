These data samples provide an unprecedented opportunity in the study of light hadron spectra and charmonium(-like) decays. We review some experimental analyses related to isospin violations at BESIII in this proceeding, which can be classify into three categories: isospin violating processes with a f 0 (980) or a 0 0 (980) production, isospin violating processes with baryon final states, and isospin violating hadronic transitions in the charmonium system.",

The significant excess of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 f 0 (980) with the anomalously large isospin violation was observed at BESIII [5]. A triangle singularity mechanism is proposed to interpret this unusual phenomenon [9]. Another theory, which is thought to be a feasible approach to clarify the phenomenon of the narrower f 0 (980), is the mixing mechanism of a 0 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) [10,11]. The BESIII collaboration recently observed the a 0 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) mixing with the statistical significance in excess of 5.0 standard deviations (\u03c3 ) [7].",

They are more inclined to be theoretically interpreted as tetra-quarks [1,2], KK molecules [3], quark-antiquark gluon hybrids [4], etc., rather than conventional quark-antiquark mesons. Recent studies indicate that the isospin violating processes associated with the f 0 (980) or a 0 0 (980) would provide insights into the intrinsic nature of the unconventional mesons f 0 (980) and a 0 0 (980). In 2012, a extremely narrow f 0 (980) signal with the width about 10 MeV via J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 f 0 (980)(\u2192 \u03c0 +,0 \u03c0 \u2212,0 ) [5] was first observed, whereas its world average width is about 50 \u2212 100 MeV/c 2 [13] in that year. In that analysis, it is found that the f 0 (980) predominantly come from the \u03b7(1405) decay, i.e., \u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 (980) [5].

Taking into account the difference between the K + K \u2212 and K 0K0 mass thresholds, the mixing mechanism predicted that a \"resonant\" peak (actually a cusp effect) appears with a width of about 10-20 MeV in the isospin violating reaction \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 [10], while the widths of both f 0 (980) and a 0 0 (980) are 50 \u2212 100 MeV/c 2 [8,14] excluding in isospin violating decays. Later, theorists proposed to examine the f 0 (980) \u2212 a 0 0 (980) mixing mechanism in the isospin violating decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 \u03b7\u03c0 0 [15] and \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [11]. In addition, mixing intensities, \u03be f a and \u03be a f , defined as effective experimental probes for the nature of a 0 0 (980) and f 0 (980), are sensitive to the coupling constants for a 0 0 (980) \u2192 KK and f 0 (980) \u2192 KK, respectively. In 2018, BESIII reported the observation of the f 0 (980) \u2212 a 0 0 (980) mixing phenomenon in the decays of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 \u03b7\u03c0 0 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , \u03d5 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) and \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [7]. The excesses of f 0 (980)-a 0 0 (980) mixing are determined with a statistical significance of larger than 5\u03c3 for the first time, and the corresponding absolute branching fractions and mixing intensities are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: The branching fractions (B) and the intensities (\u03be ) of the f 0 (980)-a 0 0 (980) mixing. The first uncertainties are statistical, the second ones are systematic, and the third are related to parameterization of f 0 (980) and a 0 0 (980).",

Thereby, the decay amplitudes reflect the flavor symmetry breaking, and it is the mass differences within the multiplet that generates the isospin or the SU(3) breaking [26]. The ratio R \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 was found to be (3.74 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.04)% by BESIII, with unprecedented high precision [27].

            "text": "In recent years, BESIII reported a number of XY Z particles (also known as the charmoniumlike states) in the charmonium region. Some isospin violating processes associated with unconventional hadrons are searched for or observed, such as Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7J/\u03c8, D * s0 (2317) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 D \u00b1 s . The tetraquark model [31] predicts that Z c (39000) can be produced in Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7J/\u03c8 with Z c (3900) decaying into \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and possibly \u03b7J/\u03c8 in the presence of sizable isospin violation. The molecular model [32] predicts a peak in the cross section of Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7J/\u03c8 at the DD 1 threshold, and a narrow peak in the \u03b7J/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum at the DD * threshold. BE-SIII performed the isospin violating process Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7J/\u03c8, but no signal excess in either the \u03b7J/\u03c8 mass spectrum or the cross-section line shape [33]. The upper limit on the ratio of the branching fractions (Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7J/\u03c8)/(Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8) at the 90% confidence level is 0.15 at \u221a s = 4.226 GeV and 0.65 at \u221a s = 4.257 GeV [33]. The D * s0 (2317) + meson is generally thought to be the P-wave cs state with spin-parity J P = 0 + . With a mass that is 45 MeV/c 2 below the DK mass threshold, it is proposed as a DK molecule [34], a csqq tetraquark state [35], one of the chiral charmed doublets [36], or a mixture of a cs meson and a csqq tetraquark [37]. BESIII observed the D * s0 (2317) \u00b1 in the decays D * s0 (2317) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 D \u00b1 s , and the absolute branching fraction is measured to be B(D * s0 (2317) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 D \u00b1 s ) =1.00 +0.00+0.00 \u22120.14\u22120.14 for the first time [38].",
