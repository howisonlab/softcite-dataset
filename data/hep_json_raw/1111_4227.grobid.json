In the DGLAP approximation, the struck quark originates from a parton cascade ordered in virtualities of the propagator partons. At low x this implies a strong ordering in transverse momentum, k T , of the emitted partons, measured with respect to the proton direction. In the BFKL approach there is no ordering in k T of the partons along the ladder. Compared to the DGLAP scheme more gluons with sizable transverse momentum are emitted near the proton direction. For this reason energetic jets of high transverse momentum produced close to the proton direction in the laboratory frame, referred to as the forward region, are considered to be especially sensitive to QCD dynamics at A gluon cascade evolves between the quark box, attached to the virtual photon, and the proton. The gluon longitudinal momentum fractions and transverse momenta are labeled x i and k T i , respectively low x [9]. Forward jet production was measured previously by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. In these measurements as well as in the present one, the requirements on the forward jet and the phase space were chosen in such a way that the standard DGLAP evolution is suppressed and the effects of BFKL dynamics are enhanced. Preference for models which employ QCD evolution non-ordered in transverse momentum was observed [10][11][12][13][14][15][16].",

In the Quark Parton Model (QPM) process e + q \u2192 e + q, the simple two-body kinematics constrain the scattered electron and the jet to be produced back-to-back, and thus predict \u03c6 = \u03c0 at the parton-level. Hadronisation effects induce some smearing to this partonlevel prediction. Inclusion of higher order processes partially decorrelates the jet from the electron. As a consequence, for evolution schemes without ordering in transverse momentum, the decorrelation is expected to increase with electron-jet rapidity distance, Y , since the phase space for additional parton emissions increases. The calculations employing the BFKL approach to next-to-leading order accuracy, indeed, predict an increase of the azimuthal angle decorrelation with the electron-jet rapidity distance [18].",

Subsequent parton emissions originate from a chain of independently radiating dipoles formed by the emitted gluons. In this approach the transverse momenta of emitted gluons perform a random walk such that CDM provides a BFKL-like approach. The leading order partonic final state is corrected to exactly reproduce the O(\u03b1 S ) matrix elements. The simulation of DJANGOH/ARIADNE uses a set of colour dipole parameters tuned to describe measurements of the hadronic final state in DIS at HERA [22]. The DJANGOH/ARIADNE predictions are referred to as CDM in the following. \u2022 CASCADE [23,24] implements the Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) evolution [25][26][27] which aims to unify the DGLAP and BFKL approaches. It introduces angular ordering of emissions to implement gluon coherence effects and thus in the high energy limit, the CCFM evolution equation is almost equivalent to the BFKL approach, while reproducing the DGLAP equations for large x and high Q 2 . CASCADE uses off-shell leading order QCD matrix elements, supplemented with gluon emissions based on the CCFM evolution equation, requiring an unintegrated gluon density function (uPDF), which takes the transverse momenta of the propagators into account. In this paper two different uPDF sets are used: set A0 [28] with only singular terms of the gluon splitting function and J2003-set 2 [29] including also nonsingular terms, labeled set 2 in the figures. These parameterisations for the unintegrated gluon density were obtained using the CCFM evolution equation to describe the structure function F 2 (x, Q 2 ) as measured by H1 [30,31] and ZEUS [32,33].

The RAPGAP and DJANGOH/ARIADNE predictions are calculated using the HERAPDF1.0 [37] set of parton distribution functions (PDF). The RAPGAP and DJANGOH/ARIADNE programs are interfaced with HERACLES [38], which allows the simulation of QED-radiative effects. These MC models are used to simulate detector effects in order to determine the acceptance and efficiency for selected forward jet events in DIS. Generated events are passed through a GEANT [39] based simulation of the H1 apparatus, which takes into account the running conditions of the data taking. Simulated events are reconstructed and analysed using the same program chain as is used for the data.",

The NLOJET++ program is used here to calculate dijet production at parton level in DIS at NLO(\u03b1 2 S ) accuracy. It should be noted that the jet search is performed on partons in the Breit frame (see Sect. 3.2), and therefore the events contain at least one jet in addition to the forward jet. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are defined for each event and are set to \u03bc r = \u03bc f = (P 2 T,sc + Q 2 )/2, where P T,sc is the transverse momentum of the forward jet in the forward jet sample or the average transverse momentum of the forward and central jet in the sample with the additional central jet. The NLO calculations are performed using the CTEQ6.6 [41] parameterisation of the parton distributions in the proton. The NLOJET++ parton level cross sections are corrected for hadronisation effects using the RAP-GAP model. The correction factors for hadronisation are estimated bin-by-bin by calculating the ratio between the cross section for jets reconstructed from stable hadrons (hadron level) and the parton level cross section. The correction factors for hadronisation are in the range from 0.90 to 1.08, increasing with rapidity distance Y . The uncertainty of the NLOJET++ predictions due to missing higher orders is estimated by applying a factor 2 or 1/2 to the renormalisation and factorisation scales simultaneously.",

These results confirm with greater precision and more differentially the previous H1 measurement of the azimuthal correlation [11] which was performed in two different x regions. The predictions of three QCD-based models with different underlying parton dynamics, discussed in Sect. 2, are compared with the data. The cross sections are well described in shape and normalisation by CDM which has a BFKL-like approach. In comparison to the older measurement the updated version of the CDM simulation with tuned parameters (see Sect. 2) shows slightly better agreement with the data. Predictions of RAPGAP, which implements DGLAP evolution, fall below the data, particularly at large Y . Calculations in the CCFM scheme as implemented in CASCADE using the uPDF set A0 [28] overestimate the measured cross section for large \u03c6 values in the two lowest Y intervals.

The statistical uncertainty (\u03b4 stat ), the uncertainty due to the hadronic energy scale (\u03b4 had ), and other systematic uncertainties (\u03b4 syst ) described in the text are given    CTEQ6.6 PDF [41] and \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.118. Large theoretical uncertainties of up to 50% from the variation of factorisation and renormalisation scales are observed. The size of the theoretical uncertainty indicates that in this phase space region higher order contributions are expected to be important. In the forward jet sample (Fig. 6) at lower Y the data are above the central NLO result but still within the theoretical uncertainty. At highest Y , taking into account the systematic error of the data due to the uncertainty of the hadronic energy scale, the agreement between the data and theoretical predictions is marginal. In the case of the 'forward and central jet' sample shown in Fig. 7, the NLO calculation provides a reasonable description of the data at low Y . Only at high Y in the regime of the BFKL evolution it is below the data, but again within the large theoretical uncertainty.",

However, MC studies with RAPGAP show that 80% of the forward jets are produced by parton showers. When the initial state parton shower is switched off, the shape of the \u03c6 distribution is only slightly changed, but the normalisation is significantly reduced. This indicates that the decorrelation in \u03c6 is mainly governed by the phase space requirements, in particular by the rapidity separation, Y , and that the normalisation of the cross sections is mainly influenced by the amount of soft radiation from parton showers, which depends on the evolution scheme.",

Differential cross sections and normalised distributions are measured as a function of the azimuthal angle difference, \u03c6, and the rapidity separation, Y , between the forward jet and the scattered positron. Investigations of the azimuthal correlation between the most forward jet and the outgoing positron are performed in different regions of Y for the forward jet sample and for the subsample with an additional central jet. To test the sensitivity of the measured observables to QCD dynamics at low x, the data are compared to QCD models with different parton evolution approaches and to predictions of next-to-leading order QCD calculations.",
