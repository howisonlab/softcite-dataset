            "text": "This paper describes the measurement of the luminosity delivered to the ATLAS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV during 2012. It is structured as follows. The strategy for measuring and calibrating the luminosity is outlined in Sect. 2, followed in Sect. 3 by a brief description of the detectors and algorithms used for luminosity determination. The absolute calibration of these algorithms by the van der Meer (vdM) method [2], which must be carried out under specially tailored beam conditions, is described in Sect. 4; the associated systematic uncertainties are detailed in Sect. 5. The comparison of the relative response of several independent luminometers during physics running reveals that significant time-and ratedependent effects impacted the performance of the ATLAS bunch-by-bunch luminometers during the 2012 run (Sect. 6). Therefore this absolute vdM calibration cannot be invoked as e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch is. Instead, it must be transferred, at one point in time and using an independent relative-luminosity monitor, from the low-luminosity regime of vdM scans to the high-luminosity conditions typical of routine physics running. Additional corrections must be applied over the course of the 2012 datataking period to compensate for detector aging (Sect. 7). The various contributions to the systematic uncertainty affecting the integrated luminosity delivered to ATLAS in 2012 are recapitulated in Sect. 8, and the final results are summarized in Sect. 9.",

This calibration, described in detail in Sect. 4, is performed using dedicated beam-separation scans, where the absolute luminosity can be inferred from direct measurements of the beam parameters [2,4]. This known luminosity is then combined with the simultaneously measured interaction rate \u03bc vis to extract \u03c3 vis . A fundamental ingredient of the ATLAS strategy to assess and control the systematic uncertainties affecting the absolute luminosity determination is to compare the measurements of several luminometers, most of which use more than one algorithm to determine the luminosity. These multiple detectors and algorithms are characterized by significantly different acceptance, response to pile-up, and sensitivity to instrumental effects and to beam-induced backgrounds. Since the calibration of the absolute luminosity scale is carried out only two or three times per year, this calibration must either remain constant over extended periods of time and under different machine conditions, or be corrected for long-term drifts. The level of consistency across the various methods, over the full range of luminosities and beam conditions, and across many months of LHC operation, provides a direct test of the accuracy and stability of the results. A full discussion of the systematic uncertainties is presented in Sects. 5-8. The information needed for physics analyses is the integrated luminosity for some well-defined data samples. The basic time unit for storing ATLAS luminosity information for physics use is the luminosity block (LB). The boundaries of each LB are defined by the ATLAS central trigger processor (CTP), and in general the duration of each LB is approximately one minute. Configuration changes, such as a trigger prescale adjustment, prompt a luminosity-block transition, and data are analysed assuming that each luminosity block contains data taken under uniform conditions, including luminosity. For each LB, the instantaneous luminosity from each detector and algorithm, averaged over the luminosity block, is stored in a relational database along with a variety of general ATLAS data-quality information. To define a data sample for physics, quality criteria are applied to select LBs where conditions are acceptable; then the instantaneous luminosity in that LB is multiplied by the LB duration to provide the integrated luminosity delivered in that LB. Additional corrections can be made for trigger deadtime and trigger prescale factors, which are also recorded on a per-LB basis. Adding up the integrated luminosity delivered in a specific set of luminosity blocks provides the integrated luminosity of the entire data sample.",

These are compared with the results of the track-counting method (Sect. 3.2), a new approach developed by ATLAS which monitors the multiplicity of charged particles produced in randomly selected colliding-bunch crossings, and is essential to assess the calibration-transfer correction from the vdM to the high-luminosity regime. Additional methods have been developed to disentangle the relative long-term drifts and run-to-run variations between the BCM, LUCID and track-counting measurements during high-luminosity running, thereby reducing the associated systematic uncertain-ties to the sub-percent level. These techniques measure the total instantaneous luminosity, summed over all bunches, by monitoring detector currents sensitive to average particle fluxes through the ATLAS calorimeters, or by reporting fluences observed in radiation-monitoring equipment; they are described in Sect. 3.3.",

Previous studies of track reconstruction in ATLAS show that in low pile-up conditions (\u03bc \u2264 1) and with a track selection looser than the above-described default, single-beam backgrounds remain well below the per-mille level [8]. However, for pileup parameters typical of 2012 physics running, tracks formed from random hit combinations, known as fake tracks, can become significant [9]. The track selection above is expected to be robust against such non-linearities, as demonstrated by analysing simulated events of overlaid inelastic pp interactions produced using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator [10]. In the simulation, the fraction of fake tracks per event can be parameterized as a function of the true pile-up parameter, yielding a fake-track fraction of less than 0.2% at \u03bc = 20 for the default track selection. In data, this fake-track contamination is subtracted from the measured track multi-plicity using the simulation-based parameterization with, as input, the \u03bc value reported by the BCMH_EventOR luminosity algorithm. An uncertainty equal to half the correction is assigned to the measured track multiplicity to account for possible systematic differences between data and simulation.",

It covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.7 and consists of a long central cylindrical barrel and two smaller extended barrels, one on each side of the long barrel. Each of these three cylinders is divided azimuthally into 64 modules and segmented into three radial sampling layers. Cells are defined in each layer according to a projective geometry, and each cell is connected by optical fibres to two photomultiplier tubes. The current drawn by each PMT is proportional to the total number of particles interacting in a given TileCal cell, and provides a signal proportional to the luminosity summed over all the colliding bunches. This current is monitored by an integrator system with a time constant of 10 ms and is sensitive to currents from 0.1 nA to 1.2 \u00b5A. The calibration and the monitoring of the linearity of the integrator electronics are ensured by a dedicated high-precision current-injection system. The collision-induced PMT current depends on the pseudorapidity of the cell considered and on the radial sampling in which it is located. The cells most sensitive to luminosity variations are located near |\u03b7| \u2248 1.25; at a given pseudorapidity, the current is largest in the innermost sampling layer, because the hadronic showers are progressively absorbed as they expand in the middle and outer radial layers. Long-term variations of the TileCal response are monitored, and corrected if appropriate [3], by injecting a laser pulse directly into the PMT, as well as by integrating the counting rate from a 137 Cs radioactive source that circulates between the calorimeter cells during calibration runs.",

The PMT currents, corrected for electronics pedestals and for non-collision backgrounds 4 and averaged over the most sensitive cells, are first crosscalibrated to the absolute luminosity reported by the BCM during the April 2012 vdM scan session (Sect. 4). Since these high-sensitivity cells would incur radiation damage at the highest luminosities encountered during 2012, thereby requiring large calibration corrections, their luminosity scale is transferred, during an early intermediate-luminosity run and on a cell-by-cell basis, to the currents measured in the remaining cells (the sensitivities of which are insufficient under the low-luminosity conditions of vdM scans).

The April scans were performed with nominal collision optics (\u03b2 = 0.6 m), which minimizes the accelerator set-up time but yields conditions which are inadequate for achieving the best possible calibration accuracy. 6 The July and November scans were performed using dedicated vdM-scan optics with \u03b2 = 11 m, in order to increase the transverse beam sizes while retaining a sufficiently high collision rate even in the tails of the scans. This strategy limits the impact of the vertex-position resolution on the nonfactorization analysis, which is detailed in Sect. 4.8, and also reduces potential \u03bc-dependent calibration biases. In addition, the observation of large non-factorization effects in the April and July scan data motivated, for the November scan, a dedicated set-up of the LHC injector chain [16] to produce more Gaussian and less correlated transverse beam profiles.",

The specific visible interaction rate \u03bc vis /(n 1 n 2 ) is measured, for each colliding-bunch pair, as a function of the nominal beam separation (i.e. the separation specified by the LHC control system) in two orthogonal scan directions (x and y). The value of \u03bc vis is determined from the raw counting rate using the formalism described in Sect. 3.1 or 3.2. The specific interaction rate is used so that the calculation of x and y properly takes into account the bunch-current variation during the scan; the measurement of the bunch-population product n 1 n 2 is detailed in Sect. 4.10. Figure 1 shows examples of horizontal-scan curves measured for a single BCID using two different algorithms. At each scan step, the visible interaction rate \u03bc vis is first corrected for afterglow, instrumental noise and beam-halo backgrounds as described in Sect. 4.4, and the nominal beam separation is rescaled using the calibrated beam-separation scale (Sect. 4.5). The impact of orbit drifts is addressed in Sect. 4.6, and that of beam-beam deflections and of the dynamic-\u03b2 effect is discussed in Sect. 4.7. For each BCID and each scan independently, a characteristic function is fitted to the corrected data; the peak of the fitted function provides a measurement of \u03bc MAX vis , while the convolved width is computed from the integral of the function using Eq. (8). Depending on the beam conditions, this function can be a single-Gaussian function plus a constant term, a double-Gaussian function plus a constant term, a Gaussian function times a polynomial (plus a constant term), or other variations. As described in Sect. 5, the differences between the results extracted using different characteristic functions are taken into account as a systematic uncertainty in the calibration result.",

This activity is attributed to a combination of shower debris from beam-gas interactions and from beam-tail particles that populate the beam halo and impinge on the luminosity detectors in time with the circulating bunch. It is observed to be proportional to the bunch population, can differ slightly between beams 1 and 2, but is otherwise uniform for all bunches in a given beam. The total single-beam background in a colliding-bunch slot is estimated by measuring the singlebeam rates in unpaired bunches (after subtracting the afterglow and noise as done for colliding-bunch slots), separately for beam 1 and beam 2, rescaling them by the ratio of the bunch populations in the unpaired and colliding bunches, and summing the contributions from the two beams. This background typically amounts to 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) of the luminosity at the peak of the scan for the LUCID (BCM) EventOR algorithms. Because it depends neither on the luminosity nor on the beam separation, it can become comparable to the actual luminosity in the tails of the scans.",

The ability to measure depends upon knowing the absolute distance by which the beams are separated during the vdM scan, which is controlled by a set of closed orbit bumps 8 applied locally near the ATLAS IP. To determine this beam-separation scale, dedicated calibration measurements were performed close in time to the April and July scan sessions using the same optical configuration at the interaction point. Such length-scale scans are performed by displacing both beams transversely by five steps over a range of up to \u00b13\u03c3 nom b , at each step keeping the beams well centred on each other in the scanning plane. The actual displacement of the luminous region can then be measured with high accuracy using the primary-vertex position reconstructed by the ATLAS tracking detectors. Since each of the four bump amplitudes (two beams in two transverse directions) depends on different magnet and lattice functions, the length-scale calibration scans are performed so that each of these four calibration constants can be extracted independently. The July 2012 calibration data for the horizontal bump of beam 2 are presented in Fig. 2. The scale factor which relates the nominal beam displacement to the measured displacement of the luminous centroid is given by the slope of the fitted straight line; the intercept is irrelevant.",

            "text": "While a single off-axis scan can provide convincing evidence for non-factorization, it samples only one thin slice in the (\u03b4 x , \u03b4 y ) beam-separation space and is therefore insufficient to fully determine the two-dimensional luminosity distribution. Characterizing the latter by performing an x-  y grid scan (rather than two one-dimensional x and y scans) would be prohibitively expensive in terms of beam time, as well as limited by potential emittance-growth biases. The strategy, therefore, is to retain the standard vdM technique (which assumes factorization) as the baseline calibration method, and to use the data to constrain possible nonfactorization biases. In the absence of input from beam-gas imaging (which requires a vertex-position resolution within the reach of LHCb only), the most powerful approach so far has been the modelling of the simultaneous beam-separationdependence of the luminosity and of the luminous-region geometry. In this procedure, the parameters describing the transverse proton-density distribution of individual bunches are determined by fitting the evolution, during vdM scans, not only of the luminosity itself but also of the position, orientation and shape of its spatial distribution, as reflected by that of reconstructed pp-collision vertices [23]. Luminosity pro-files are then generated for simulated vdM scans using these fitted single-beam parameters, and analysed in the same fashion as real vdM scan data. The impact of non-factorization on the absolute luminosity scale is quantified by the ratio R NF of the \"measured\" luminosity extracted from the onedimensional simulated luminosity profiles using the standard vdM method, to the \"true\" luminosity from the computed four-dimensional (x, y, z, t) overlap integral [7] of the singlebunch distributions at zero beam separation. This technique is closely related to beam-beam imaging [7,24,25], with the notable difference that it is much less sensitive to the vertexposition resolution because it is used only to estimate a small fractional correction to the overlap integral, rather than its full value. The luminous region is modelled by a three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid [7]. Its parameters are extracted, at each scan step, from an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit of a 3D Gaussian function to the spatial distribution of the reconstructed primary vertices that were collected, at the corresponding beam separation, from the limited subset of colliding-bunch pairs monitored by the high-rate, dedicated ID-only data stream (Sect. 3.2). The vertex-position resolution, which is somewhat larger (smaller) than the transverse luminous size during scan sets I-III (scan sets IV-XV), is determined from the data as part of the fitting procedure [23]. It potentially impacts the reported horizontal and vertical luminous sizes, but not the measured position, orientation nor length of the luminous ellipsoid.",

The overlap integral of these density distributions, which allows for a crossing angle in both planes, is evaluated at each scan step to predict the produced luminosity and the geometry of the luminous region for a given set of bunch parameters. This calculation takes into account the impact, on the relevant observables, of the luminosity backgrounds, orbit drifts and beam-beam corrections. The bunch parameters are then adjusted, by means of a \u03c7 2 -minimization procedure, to provide the best possible description of the centroid position, the orientation and the resolution-corrected widths of the luminous region measured at each step of a given set of on-axis x and y scans. Such a fit is illustrated in Fig. 4 for one of the horizontal scans in the July 2012 session. The goodness of fit is satisfactory (\u03c7 2 = 1.3 per degree of freedom), even if some systematic deviations are apparent in the tails of the scan. The strong horizontal-separation dependence of the The red line is the result of the fit described in the text vertical luminous size (Fig. 4d) confirms the presence of significant non-factorization effects, as already established from the off-axis luminosity data for that scan session (Fig. 3a). This procedure is applied to all 2012 vdM scan sets, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5. The luminosity extracted from the standard vdM analysis with the assumption that factorization is valid, is larger than that computed from the reconstructed single-bunch parameters. This implies that neglecting non-factorization effects in the vdM calibration leads to overestimating the absolute luminosity scale (or equivalently underestimating the visible crosssection) by up to 3% (4.5%) in the April (July) scan session. Non-factorization biases remain below 0.8% in the November scans, thanks to bunch-tailoring in the LHC injector chain [16]. These observations are consistent, in terms both of absolute magnitude and of time evolution within a scan session, with those reported by LHCb [21] and CMS [29,30] in the same fills.",

However, the above-described correction procedure is, strictly speaking, applicable only when non-factorization effects are small enough to be neglected. When the factorization hypothesis no longer holds, the very concept of separating horizontal and vertical emittance growth is ill-defined. In addition, the time evolution of the fitted one-dimensional convolved widths and of the associated peak specific rates is presumably more influenced by the progressive dilution, over time, of the non-factorization effects discussed in Sect. 4.8 above. Therefore, and given that the non-factorization cor- rections applied to scan sets I-VIII ( Fig. 5) are up to ten times larger than a typical emittance-growth correction, no such correction is applied to the April and July scan results; an appropriately conservative systematic uncertainty must be assigned instead.",

The LHC bunch currents are determined in a multi-step process due to the different capabilities of the available instrumentation. First, the total intensity of each beam is monitored by two identical and redundant DC current transformers (DCCT), which are high-accuracy devices but have no ability to distinguish individual bunch populations. Each beam is also monitored by two fast beam-current transformers (FBCT), which measure relative bunch currents individually for each of the 3564 nominal 25 ns slots in each beam; these fractional bunch populations are converted into absolute bunch currents using the overall current scale provided by the DCCT. Finally, corrections are applied to account for out-of-time charge present in a given BCID but not colliding at the interaction point.",

Highly precise measurements of these tiny currents (normally at most a few per mille of the total intensity) have been achieved [27] by comparing the number of beam-gas vertices reconstructed by LHCb in nominally empty bunch slots, to that in non-colliding bunches whose current is easily measurable. For the 2012 luminosity-calibration fills, the ghostcharge correction to the bunch-population product ranges from \u22120.21 to \u22120.65%; its systematic uncertainty is dominated by that affecting the LHCb trigger efficiency for beamgas events.",

Track counting is chosen as the reference here because it is the bunch-by-bunch algorithm whose absolute calibration is the most stable over time (Figs. 6 and 9a), and that displays the best stability relative to all bunch-integrating luminosity algorithms during physics running across the entire 2012 running period (this is demonstrated in Sect. 6.1). By construction, the instrumentalstability parameter S k instr, j is sensitive only to instrumental effects, because the corrections described in Sects. 4.5-4.10 are intrinsically independent of the luminosity algorithm considered.

This degradation is understood to be caused by PMT aging. \u2022 The BCMH_EventOR efficiency increases by about 0.7% with respect to that of track counting between the April and July sessions, and then remains stable to within 0.2-0.4% across the July and November sessions. In contrast, the efficiency of the BCMV_EventOR algorithm compared to that of track counting increases by about 1.3% from April to July, and drops back to its original level by the November session. These long-term variations in the response of various subsets of diamond sensors in the low-luminosity regime of vdM scans are possibly related to subtle solid-state physics effects arising from the combination of radiation damage during physics running [3,34] and of partial annealing during beam-off and low-luminosity periods. Aging effects of comparable magnitude are observed at high luminosity (Sect. 6). \u2022 Given the 0.7% relative stability, between scan sets I-III and IV-VI, of the track-counting and BCMH_EventOR calibrations (Fig. 9b), the 1.4-2.0% discrepancy, between the April and July vdM-scan sessions, that affects the absolute calibrations of both the BCMH_EventOR and the track-counting algorithms (Fig. 9a) cannot be primarily instrumental in nature. The actual cause could not be identified with certainty. Since the transverse luminous size \u03c3 L in the April session (Table 2) is approximately three times smaller than the vertex-position resolution, a plausible scenario is that a small error in the estimated resolution biases the reconstructed luminous size in such a way as to underestimate the non-factorization corrections R NF , and thereby the visible cross-sections, in scan sets I-III. \u2022 Similarly, the 1.3% discrepancy, between scan sets IV-VI and scan set VIII, of the absolute calibrations of all algorithms (Fig. 9a) cannot be instrumental either. Here however, the luminous size is 1.5 times larger than the resolution: resolution biases (if any) should be noticeably smaller than in the April scan session. But as scan sets IV-VIII were carried out in two consecutive LHC fills under very similar beam conditions, such biases should impact scan sets IV-VI and VIII in the same manner.",

In addition, the calibrations extracted from scan sets I-VIII are affected by several large adjustments that in some cases partially cancel (Fig. 8); of these the most uncertain are the non-factorization corrections, which affect the November scans much less. The cumulated magnitude of the corrections is also smallest for scan sets XI-XV (scan set X suffers from larger orbit-drift and emittance-growth corrections because of the long delay between the x and y scans). The combination of these arguments suggests that the visible cross-sections, averaged over all colliding bunches in each scan set and then averaged over scan sets XI-XV, should be adopted as the best estimate \u03c3 vis of the absolute luminosity scale at the time of, and applicable to the beam conditions during, the November 2012 vdM session.

Bunch-to-bunch variations of the specific luminosity are typically 5-10% ( Fig. 10a), reflecting bunch-to-bunch differ- ences in transverse emittance also seen during normal physics fills. A systematic reduction in L spec can be observed from scan XI to scan XIV, caused by emittance growth over the duration of the fill.

Scan sets I-VIII are best modelled using a double Gaussian function plus a constant. The beam shapes are different in scan sets X-XV [16]: here the best fit is obtained using a Gaussian function multiplied by a sixth-order polynomial. Additional fits are performed with different model assumptions: a super-Gaussian function, and a Gaussian function multiplied by a fourth-order polynomial (plus a constant term in all cases). The maximum fractional difference between the results of these different fits, across scan sets XI-XV and across the BCM, LUCID and trackcounting algorithms, amounts to 0.5%. This value is assigned as the uncertainty associated with the fit model.",

While the three working points are consistent within 0.2% at the very beginning of the 2012 running period (which corresponds to the April vdM-scan session), counting vertex-associated tracks results, during most of the year, in a luminosity value lower by about 1.3% compared to the other two WPs. Comparison with the history of the mean pile-up parameter (Fig. 12) suggests that this inconsistency is not time-related but \u03bc-dependent, as further discussed in Sect. 6.2. Figure 15 shows the ratio of the integrated luminosity per ATLAS run as measured by a variety of luminosity algo-  rithms, to that reported by the TileCal. Even though a systematic trend between the LAr and TileCal measurements is apparent, the calorimeter algorithms are consistent to better than \u00b10.7%. The TileCal luminosity is consistent with that from the default track-counting algorithm to within \u00b10.4% or less. In contrast, both BCM and LUCID exhibit significant variations in response over the course of 2012, which vary from channel to channel and are attributed to, respectively, radiation-induced lattice defects and PMT aging. Among these, the BCMH_EventOR algorithm exhibits the least severe deviation from its response at the time of the November vdM-scan session. Its long-term drift is, however, large enough to warrant a time-dependent response correction that is based on one of the more stable relative-luminosity monitors shown in Fig. 15, and that is described in Sect. 7.3.2.",

            "text": "As the pile-up response of a given luminosity algorithm is determined by the instrumental characteristics of the luminometer considered, the BCMH_EventOR and BCMV_ EventOR algorithms are expected to exhibit little \u03bc-dependence with respect to each other, even if both may be affected by a common non-linearity with respect to the actual instantaneous luminosity. The same applies to ratios of luminosity values reported independently by the A and C arms of FCal, EMEC, LUCID and TileCal. In contrast, the track-counting luminosities obtained using the three track selections defined in Sect. 3.2 exhibit a noticeable relative non-linearity (Fig. 16a). The pattern is consistent with that observed in Fig. 14. At very low \u03bc, the three working points are fully consistent, as expected from having been vdM-calibrated at \u03bc \u223c 0.5. As \u03bc increases, loosening the pixel-hole requirement on the selected tracks results, after fake-track subtraction, in a residual positive non-linearity of at most 0.7% in the reported \u03bc value. In contrast, the vertex-associated track count exhibits, also after fake-track correction, a negative non-linearity with respect to the default WP, which peaks at \u22121.3% and then decreases in magnitude. Even though the simulation should account for the pile-up dependence of the fake-track fraction and of the track-and vertex-reconstruction efficiencies, it fails to explain the relative \u03bc-dependence observed in the data between the three track-counting selections. The onset of the discrepancies appears to lie in the range 2 < \u03bc < 10. However, only very limited data, all from a single run with a small number of isolated bunches, are available in that \u03bc range, so that no firm conclusions can be drawn. A conservative approach is therefore adopted: the observed discrepancy between trackcounting WPs is used as a data-driven upper limit on a potential bias affecting the absolute track-based luminosity scale in the high-\u03bc regime. The impact of this systematic uncertainty is discussed in Sect. 7.3.1.",

            "text": "The second step in transferring the vdM-based calibrations to an arbitrary high-luminosity physics run consists in correcting for the long-term drifts apparent in Fig. 15, using one of the more stable monitors (EMEC, FCal, TileCal or track counting) as a reference. The absolute luminosity scale of the selected reference monitor is first anchored to that of BCM (or LUCID) in the high-luminosity reference run where the calibration transfer is performed (LHC fill 3323). The runby-run luminosity ratio of the considered bunch-by-bunch algorithm to the chosen reference is then parameterized as a function of the cumulative integrated-luminosity fraction. This choice of variable, instead of calendar time, is inspired by (but not dependent upon) the assumption that detector aging increases smoothly with integrated radiation dose; it also simplifies the analysis by eliminating the gaps between running periods (Fig. 15). A two-segment, piece-wise linear fit is used to smooth the run-to-run fluctuations, with one segment covering the entire year except for the BCM noise period, and the second, shorter segment accounting for the gain shift during that same noise period (Fig. 18). This empirical parameterization yields a satisfactory description of the entire data set. It provides a run-by-run correction to the instantaneous luminosity reported by each BCM or LUCID algorithm: a positive (negative) value of the fit function in a given ATLAS run results in a downwards (upwards) luminosity adjustment for every luminosity block in that run. This implies that the absolute luminosity scale in each LHC fill is effectively carried by the reference monitor, while the timeand BCID-dependence of the luminosity during that same fill continues to be provided by the bunch-by-bunch algorithm considered.",

For high-luminosity runs (\u03b2 = 0.6 m and at least 1050 colliding bunches) under stable-beam conditions, after background subtraction, calibration transfer and long-term drift correction of the BCM and LUCID data, the integrated luminosity reported by BCMV_EventOR agrees with that from the BCMH_EventOR baseline within 0.01%. For the subset of such runs where both LUCID and BCM deliver valid luminosity data, which corresponds to about 91% of the 2012 integrated luminosity, both single-arm LUCID algorithms agree with the BCMH_EventOR baseline within 0.5%. It should be stressed, however, that these BCMand LUCID-based luminosity determinations are correlated, because they were all drift-corrected to the same reference. The internal consistency of the absolute luminosity measurements at \u221a s = 8 TeV in the high-luminosity regime is illustrated in Fig. 19. The run-to-run fluctuations reflect the combined impact of the relative \u03bc-dependence of the various algorithms, of imperfectly corrected medium-term drifts and of other sources of non-reproducibility. With the exception of some of the LUCID data, they remain within a \u00b10.5% band, which provides a measure of the systematic uncertainty associated with the run-to-run consistency of independent luminosity measurements. Table 9 regroups the contributions to the total uncertainty in the luminosity values provided for physics analyses. The vdM-calibration uncertainties are detailed in Tables 5 and 6. The afterglow subtraction, the calibration transfer from the vdM-scan to the high-luminosity regime and the long-term drift correction applied to the bunch-by-bunch luminometers are described in Sects. 7.2, 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 respectively. The run-to-run consistency of the ATLAS luminosity measurements is assessed in Sect. 7.4. The resulting total uncertainty amounts to \u00b11.9%.  ",

The vdM-calibration uncertainty is smaller than for the 2011 data set [3], thanks to improved control of beam-dynamical effects (beam-beam deflections, dynamic \u03b2, non-factorization) and to a refined analysis of the non-reproducibility of beam conditions (orbit drift, emittance growth). The total systematic uncertainty in the delivered luminosity is no longer dominated by vdMcalibration uncertainties. The largest contribution arises from instrumental effects that require the transfer of the absolute luminosity scale from the low-rate vdM-scan regime to the high-luminosity conditions of routine physics operation; residual run-to-run and long-term inconsistencies between independent luminosity measurements also contribute significantly. The combination of these systematic uncertainties results in a final uncertainty of \u03b4L/L = \u00b11.9% in the luminosity measured by ATLAS during pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV for the 22.7 fb \u22121 of data delivered to ATLAS in 2012. This uncertainty applies to the high-luminosity data sample and any subset thereof, but not necessarily to a few special runs taken under very low pile-up conditions, such as those dedicated to elastic-scattering measurements: the latter require a separate analysis tailored to their specific experimental conditions.",
