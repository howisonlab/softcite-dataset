Present Run II follows a development phase to assess the feasibility of a long term acquisition program, Run I, which successfully ended in July 2015 with 1 fb \u22121 integrated luminosity collected in less than eight months. KLOE-2 represents the continuation of the KLOE experiment with a new physics program. The KLOE detector has undergone several upgrades including state-of-the-art cylindrical GEM Inner Tracker, electron-positron taggers for the \u03b3\u03b3-physics studies and new calorimeters around the interaction point. In this article we briefly present the overview of the KLOE-2 experiment including the present status and achievements together with the physics plans.",

For the first time the \"'Crab-Waist\"' interaction scheme developed in Frascati has been applied in the presence of a high-field detector solenoid, where the transverse dimensions of the beams and their crossing angle are tuned to maximize the machine luminosity [2]. KLOE-2 achieved a record performance in terms of 2 x 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 peak luminosity and 12 pb \u22121 maximum daily integrated luminosity with this innovative scheme of beam collisions, which will be employed in the upgrade of the B-factory currently under construction at the KEK Laboratory in Japan, and is also considered a valid option in several future projects.",

            "text": "The main components of the KLOE-2 detector are the Drift Chamber, one of the biggest ever built, and a lead-scintillating fiber Electromagnetic Calorimeter, one of the best ones for energy and timing performance at low energies. The KLOE drift chamber provides three-dimensional tracking with perpendicular decay vertex resolution of the order of 1 mm and transverse momentum accuracy better than 0.4% [3]. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of a 24-module barrel surrounding the drift chamber and two endcap detectors which together cover in around 98% of the solid angle. It provides determination of energy and time with accuracies of \u03c3 E /E = 5.7%/ \u221a E[GeV] and \u03c3(t) = 57ps/ \u221a E[GeV] \u2295 100 ps, respectively [4]. To improve vertex reconstruction capabilities near the interaction region KLOE-2 was equipped with an inner tracker and it is the first high-energy experiment using the GEM technology with a cylindrical geometry, a novel idea that was developed at LNF exploiting the kapton properties to build a transparent and compact tracking system [5]. To study \u03b3\u03b3-physics the detector has been upgraded with two pairs of electron-positron taggers. The Low Energy Tagger (LET) is a small calorimeter placed inside KLOE near the interaction piont, consisting of LYSO crystals read out by silicon photomultipliers. This subdetector will serve to measure electrons and positrons from \u03b3\u03b3 interaction with energy up to around 400 MeV [6]. The second tagger is called High Energy Tagger (HET) which provides measurement of the displacement of the scattered leptons with respect to the main orbit. Therefore, it was inserted inside the machine lattice 11 m away from the interaction point. This position sensitive detector consists of 30 small BC418 scintillators 3x3x5 mm 3 , which provide a spatial resolution of 2 mm (corresponding to momentum resolution of \u223c1 MeV/c) [7]. In parallel to the ongoing data taking campaign we have completed several analyses using the old KLOE data sample. Some of these results will be briefly described in the next section.",

            "text": "In the framework of the Dark Matter searches it was postulated, that there may exist a secluded gauge sector mediated by a new vector gauge boson U, called also the dark photon [10]. The dark photon could couple with ordinary photon via mixing term and subsequently decay into Standard Model particles giving opportunity to be observed in high-energy experiments. Direct searches of these dark matter mediators are performed with several experiments including KLOE-2. We have explored three different processes: Dalitz decays of the \u03c6 meson: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U, U \u2192 e + e \u2212 with \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 [11,12], e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3 with U decaying to lepton or pion pairs [13][14][15] and the dark Higgsstrahlung process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh 0 , U \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 with h 0 invisible [16]. Search for the dark photon in the \u03c6 Dalitz dacays were performed using an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb \u22121 and 1.5 fb \u22121 for \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , respectively. The irreducible background from the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 decay was directly extracted from the data by a fit to the di-lepton invariant mass distribution parameterized according to the Vector Meson Dominance model. No resonant signal was observed in the e + e \u2212 invariant mass distributions for both \u03b7 decays. As a result we have estimated upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter as a function of the U boson mass which is shown in Fig. 2 as the KLOE (1) region. We have searched for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3 analysing three possible U decays into e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Again the signature of the dark photon is the narrow structure of the lepton-antilepton or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution. In case of the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 we were looking for both charged particles emitted with large polar angle and an undetected photon at a small angle which resulted in  Figure 2. 90% CL exclusion plot for the U boson coupling \u03b5 2 as a function of the U-boson mass. The limits obtained by KLOE-2 are denoted as: KLOE (1) (\u03c6 Dalitz dacay studies [11,12]), KLOE (2) (e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 [13]), KLOE (3) (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 [14]) and KLOE (4) (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 [15]). The limits from the A1 [17], APEX [18], the WASA [19], HADES [20], BaBar [21] and NA48/2 [22] experiments are also shown. The gray dashed lines shows U boson parameters that could explain the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment [23]. a strong suppression of the resonant \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and FSR background. The residual background components were simulated and fitted to the invariant mass spectra. The measured distributions are in perfect agreement with the simulations done with the PHOKHARA generator [24] and does not show any peak structure. The exclusion limits estimated based on these studies are shown in Fig. 2 as KLOE (2) , KLOE (3) and KLOE (4) regions. A natural consequence of massive dark photon would be the existence of associated Higgs-like particle h , so-called dark Higgs, coupling to U with coupling constant \u03b1 D . Thus, the U boson could manifest itself in the e + e \u2212 collisions through the Higgsstrahlung process: e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh where U decays to the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pair. If the mass of h exeeds mass of the U boson the transition h \u2192 U is allowed and one can search for the Standard Model decay products of both U bosons produced (e.g. two di-lepton or di-pion pairs) [25,26]. The KLOE-2 analysis was done assuming m h < m U , therefore we were looking for the missing mass in the final state of \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [16]. The expected signal would show up as a sharp enhancement in the two dimensional distribution of \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 missing mass versus the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 invariant mass. In order to better understand backgrounds, two data samples were analysed: sample gathered at the \u03c6 mass peak (1.65 f b \u22121 ) and the off-peak sample at \u221a s = 1000 MeV (0.2 f b \u22121 ), where backgrounds are strongly reduced. The 90% confidence level limits of \u03b1 D \u2022 \u03b5 2 obtained by KLOE-2 for combined on-and off-peak data samples are at the level of 10 \u22129 \u2212 10 \u22128 depending on the masses of U and h [16].",

The final values of the charge asymmetries are all consistent with zero and were obtained with the best sensitivity in the world [27]. Precise determination of the transition form factors (TFF) of mesons is crucial in many fields of particle physics, such as determination of the light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon or understanding the low-energy structure of hadrons. KLOE-2 has obtained new results on TFFs and branching fractions for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decays [28,29]. In the case of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 decay the Form Factor F \u03c6 \u03b7 was extracted from the e + e \u2212 invariant mass spectrum by dividing the measured invariant mass spectrum by the spectrum of reconstructed MC signal events generated with a constant F \u03c6 \u03b7 , after all the analysis cuts. The resulting F \u03c6 \u03b7 distribution has been fitted as a function of the invariant mass with the Vector Meson Dominance model (VMD) parametrization [30]. The result of the fit is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3 together with theoretical predictions from the VMD (pink dashed curve) and Terschluesen/Leupold models [31]. The value of the TFF slope obtained with the fit amounts to b \u03c6\u03b7 = 1.28\u00b10.10 +0.09 \u22120.08 GeV \u22122 [28] and is in agreement with the VMD predictions [30]. An analogus analysis of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 decay led to the determination of the modulus square of the F \u03c6 \u03c0 0 Transition Form Factor in a function of the 4-momentum modulus q 2 below 700 MeV [29] shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 together with theoretical expectations. As one can see the chiral theory approach [34] is favoured by the data. The TFF slope parameter extracted from this dependence amounts to b \u03c6\u03c0 0 = 2.02 \u00b1 0.11 GeV \u22122 .",
