The changes include a revised reconstruction of \u03c0 0 candidates, and improvements in multivariate discriminants to separate \u03c4 leptons from jets and electrons. The algorithm is extended to reconstruct \u03c4 leptons in highly Lorentz-boosted pair production, and in the high-level trigger. The performance of the algorithm is studied using protonproton collisions recorded during 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The performance is evaluated in terms of the efficiency for a genuine \u03c4 lepton to pass the identification criteria and of the probabilities for jets, electrons, and muons to be misidentified as \u03c4 leptons. The results are found to be very close to those expected from Monte Carlo simulation.",

            "text": "Searches for new phenomena that consider signatures with \u03c4 leptons have gained great interest in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. The most prominent one among these is the decay of Higgs bosons (H) to pairs of \u03c4 leptons, which constitutes an especially sensitive channel for probing Higgs boson couplings to fermions. The observation of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decaying to a pair of \u03c4 leptons has recently been reported [1,2]. Moreover, searches with \u03c4 leptons in the final state have high sensitivity to the production of both neutral and charged Higgs bosons expected in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [3,4], in which enhancements in the couplings to \u03c4 leptons can be substantial at large tan\u03b2, where tan\u03b2 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets in the MSSM. Examples of such searches can be found in refs. [5][6][7]. In addition, searches for particles beyond the SM, such as new or heavy Higgs bosons [8][9][10][11], leptoquarks [12], supersymmetric particles [13][14][15][16], or gauge bosons [17][18][19] benefit significantly from any improvements made in \u03c4 lepton reconstruction and identification.",

After a brief introduction of the CMS detector in section 2, we discuss the data and the event simulations used to evaluate the performance of the HPS algorithm in section 3. The reconstruction and identification of physical objects (other than \u03c4 h ) is briefly described in section 4. Section 5 describes the HPS algorithm used for 13 TeV data and its simulation. The extended version of the algorithm used to reconstruct \u03c4 h pairs produced in topologies with high Lorentz-boosts is presented in section 6, while the specialized version developed for trigger purposes is discussed in section 7. The selection of events used to evaluate the performance of the \u03c4 h reconstruction algorithm, as well as systematic uncertainties common to all measurements are discussed in section 8. The performance evaluation of the improved algorithm using selected data samples is given thereafter: section 9 describes the \u03c4 h identification efficiency, while sections 10 and 11 summarize the respective jet \u2192 \u03c4 h and e/\u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification probabilities. The \u03c4 h energy scale is discussed in section 12. Finally, section 13 presents the performance of \u03c4 h identification in the high-level trigger, and a brief summary in section 14 concludes this paper.",

The performance of the HPS algorithm in such topologies is poor, as it was designed to reconstruct only one \u03c4 h per jet. A dedicated version of the HPS algorithm was therefore recently developed to reconstruct two \u03c4 leptons with large momenta that typically originate from decays of large-momentum Z or Higgs bosons. This algorithm takes advantage of jet substructure techniques, as follows. A collection of \"large-radius jets\" is assembled from the PF candidates using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [64] with a distance parameter of 0.8 (CA8). Due to the large boosts, the emitted \u03c4 lepton decay products are expected to be contained within the same CA8 jet, when its p T exceeds 100 GeV. The algorithm proceeds by reversing the final step of the clustering algorithm for each given CA8 jet, to find two subjets s j 1 and s j 2 that can be expected to coincide with the two \u03c4 leptons from the decay of the boosted massive boson. To reduce the misidentification of jets arising from QCD multijet events, sj 1 and sj 2 must satisfy the following additional restrictions:",

When these requirements cannot be met, the pair of subjets is discarded, and the procedure is repeated, treating the subjet with largest mass as the initial jet that is then split into two new subjets. If the algorithm is unable to find two subjets satisfying the above criteria within a given CA8 jet, no \u03c4 h reconstruction is performed from this CA8 jet, and the algorithm moves on to the next such jet. When two subjets satisfying the requirements are found, they are passed to the HPS algorithm as seeds. At this stage, the algorithm does not differentiate between subjets arising from hadronic or leptonic \u03c4 decays. After reconstruction, the decay-mode criteria (section 5.1.2) and the MVA-based isolation discriminants (section 5.2.2) are applied to the reconstructed \u03c4 h candidate, taking into account just the PF candidates belonging to the subjet that seeds the \u03c4 h in the reconstruction and the isolation calculations. The decay-mode criteria are relaxed relative to those used in the standard HPS algorithm by accepting \u03c4 h candidates with two charged hadrons, and therefore an absolute charge different from unity. This relaxation recovers \u03c4 leptons decaying into three charged hadrons when one of the tracks is not reconstructed in the dense environment of a high-p T jet. If an electron or muon, reconstructed and identified through the usual techniques available for these leptons [21,22], is found to be near (\u2206R < 0.1) to a \u03c4 h candidate reconstructed from a subjet, the corresponding CA8 jet is considered to originate from a semileptonic \u03c4 lepton pair decay. Cases in which both \u03c4 leptons decay leptonically are not considered. Figure 6 compares the efficiencies in standard reconstruction with that for highly boosted \u03c4 lepton pairs in simulated events of R \u2192 HH \u2192 bb\u03c4\u03c4 decays in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h final states. In addition, the expected probability for large-radius jets to be misidentified as \u03c4 h pairs is shown for simulated QCD multijet events. While the efficiency in \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h events is computed just for the \u03c4 h candidate, it is computed once relative to one \u03c4 h candidate and once relative to both \u03c4 h candidates in \u03c4 h \u03c4 h events. The misidentification probability is calculated in \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states for both \u03c4 h candidates. The \u03c4 h candidates are selected requiring p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3, using the very loose WP of the MVA-based isolation.",

This is achieved using specialized, fast, or regional versions of reconstruction algorithms, and through implementation of multistep selection logic, designed to reduce the number of events processed by more complex, and therefore more time consuming subsequent steps.

Tracks are reconstructed from hits in the pixel detector around the L2 \u03c4 h jets (rectangular regions of \u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6 = 0.5\u00d70.5), and used to form vertices. If no vertex is found, the \u03c4 h jet is passed to the following step for more detailed scrutiny. If, on the other hand, at least one vertex is found, the one with highest p 2 T of its tracks is assumed to be the primary hard-scattering vertex in the event. Tracks originating from within d z < 0.1 cm of the hard-scattering vertex, in an annulus of 0.15 < \u2206R < 0.4 centered on the \u03c4 h jet direction, and with at least three hits in the pixel detector, are used in the computation of the \u03c4 h -17 -2018 JINST 13 P10005 jet isolation. An L2 \u03c4 h jet is considered isolated if the scalar sum of the p T of the associated pixel tracks p track T is less than 1.85 GeV. Finally, at Level 3 (L3), full track reconstruction, using both pixel and strip detectors, is executed using rectangular regions of size \u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6 = 0.5\u00d70.5 around the L2 \u03c4 h jets, followed by the PF reconstruction.

Consequently, again, we require at least one well-identified, isolated electron or muon (tag) and one isolated \u03c4 h candidate (probe). The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 ee events are selected by requiring a single-electron trigger to have fired.

It should be recognized that p jet T differs from p \u03c4 h T because the four-momentum of the jet is computed by summing the momenta of all its constituents, while the \u03c4 h four-momentum is computed only from the charged hadrons and photons used in the reconstruction of the specified decay mode of the \u03c4 h candidate. For p jet T < 300 GeV, the p \u03c4 h T constitutes on average only 40% of the jet p T . Furthermore, p jet T is subject to additional jet energy corrections, whereas p \u03c4 h T is not. In the measurement of the misidentification probability, backgrounds with genuine \u03c4 h are subtracted, based on the expectations from simulated events. The fraction of events with genuine \u03c4 h candidates in the sample passing the \u03c4 h identification criteria is well below 10% for \u03c4 h with p T < 100 GeV, but reaches up to 50% for p T \u2248 300 GeV. Furthermore, backgrounds with prompt electrons and muons giving rise to \u03c4 h candidates are also subtracted based on expectations from simulated events. To reject events from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 production, the loose WP of the against-\u00b5 discriminant described in section 5.4 is applied to the reconstructed \u03c4 h candidates.",

The first one is similar to the \u00b5\u03c4 h trigger in that an isolated electromagnetic (e or \u03b3) object with p T > 22 GeV is required at L1, and is used to initiate the reconstruction of an isolated electron at the HLT that is required to have p T > 24 GeV.

At L1, this trigger requires p miss T in excess of 80-100 GeV, again with the threshold dynamically adjusted as a function of instantaneous luminosity to keep the rate of events passing L1 constant. At the HLT, the selected events must further satisfy the condition of p miss T > 90 GeV. After this, the L3 \u03c4 h reconstruction step is executed, and events are finally saved when an L3 \u03c4 h candidate with p T > 50 GeV, passing the loose WP of charged isolation (relaxed by 6%/GeV for p \u03c4 h T > 100 GeV) is found, with its leading charged hadron satisfying p T > 30 GeV. At L = 1.4 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , the rate for the \u03c4 h p miss T trigger is about 20 Hz. Finally, a high-p T single-\u03c4 h trigger was developed for searches for high-mass resonances decaying into at least one \u03c4 lepton, for example W , H \u00b1 , or the heavy A or H boson in MSSM. This trigger was designed to cover portions of the phase space not covered by the more usual cross-triggers (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h , \u03c4 h p miss T , e\u03c4 h , and \u00b5\u03c4 h ), e.g., H \u00b1 events with an energetic \u03c4 h but small p miss T . The trigger that fulfilled those conditions required an isolated L1 \u03c4 h candidate with p T > 120 GeV. The \u03c4 h reconstruction at the HLT consists of steps taken in L2, L2.5, and L3. The L3 requires one \u03c4 h candidate with p T > 140 GeV, and with a leading charged hadron with p T > 50 GeV. The L3 \u03c4 h candidate has to pass also the tight WP of charged isolation, which is linearly relaxed by 2%/GeV for p \u03c4 h T > 275 GeV, and is discarded for p \u03c4 h T > 500 GeV. Rates of about 30 Hz were allocated to this trigger. The basic features of triggers with \u03c4 h candidates used to record pp collisions in 2016 are summarized in table 8. The efficiencies of the \u03c4 h part of the triggers listed in table 8 are measured via the tag-and-probe technique as a function of the offline-reconstructed p \u03c4 h T , using data enriched in \u03c4 h leptons from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h decays. To single out this sample, the selections for the \u00b5\u03c4 h final state described in section 8.1, together with the requirement of m T < 30 GeV and the additional condition of 40 < m vis < 80 GeV, are applied to data previously collected through single-muon triggers. Furthermore, to provide an efficiency measurement that is specific to the selections used in H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 analyses, the \u03c4 h candidates must pass the tight WP of the MVA-based isolation discriminant.

[24], has been improved. The changes include a dynamic strip reconstruction, the reconstruction of highly boosted \u03c4 lepton pairs, and the introduction of additional variables in the multivariateanalysis discriminants used to reject jets and electrons. The isolation discriminants have also been optimized to cope with the large pileup of events in \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton runs. The performance of the improved algorithm has been measured using 35.9 fb \u22121 of data recorded during 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The \u03c4 h identification efficiency in data at low, intermediate, and high transverse momenta, as well as for highly Lorentz-boosted \u03c4 lepton pairs, is similar to that expected from Monte Carlo simulation, while differences of 10-20% are found between data and simulation for the jet \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification probability. The e \u2192 \u03c4 h and \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c4 h misidentification probabilities are smaller than those of the previous version of the algorithm under the same running conditions, while maintaining a high efficiency for the selection of genuine \u03c4 h candidates. The corresponding data-to-simulation scale factors have also been determined. The energy scale of \u03c4 h candidates is measured, and its response relative to Monte Carlo simulation is found to be close to unity. Finally, a specialized \u03c4 h reconstruction and identification algorithm has been used in the high-level trigger, and its performance has been presented.",
