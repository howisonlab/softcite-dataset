The comparison is performed under limit setting and signal discovery scenarios, considering both when an oscillation would enhance the neutrino interaction rate in the detector and when it would reduce it. The sensitivity of the experiments and the confidence regions extracted for specific data sets change considerably according to which test statistic is used and the assumptions on its probability distribution. A standardized analysis approach based on the most general kind of hypothesis test is proposed.",

The sterile neutrino is a particular type of neutrino that does not interact through the weak force. Since Pontecorvo postulated its existence in 1967 [2], the sterile neutrino has become increasingly popular and its existence is nowadays often invoked to explain the mysterious origin of neutrino masses and dark matter [3]. The discovery of sterile neutrinos would hence be a milestone towards the development of new theories beyond the Standard Model, with deep repercussions in particle physics and cosmology.",

The maximum value of the oscillation probability is proportional to sin 2 (2\u03b8) that acts as a scaling factor, while the modulation of the probability is determined by \u0394m 2 .

The strategy used to reconstruct E varies according to the primary channel through which neutrinos interact in the detector. Experiments using low energy anti-neutrinos can measure E through a calorimetric approach thanks to the fact that anti-neutrinos interact via inverse beta decay and their energy is entirely absorbed within the detector. In experiments with high energy neutrinos interacting through charged-current quasi-elastic reactions, E is estimated from the kinematic of the particles produced in the interaction. Some experiments measure neutrinos that interact through electron scattering and release only a random fraction of their energy inside the detector. In this cases the energy cannot be accurately reconstructed and monoenergetic neutrino sources are typically used. In the following we will use L rec and E rec to refer to the reconstructed value of baseline and energy. Table 1 shows for each experiment the range and resolution of L rec and E rec . To maximize the sensitivity to sterile neutrino masses at the eV-scale, the experiments are designed to be sensitive to L rec /E rec values of the order of 1 m/MeV.

When the neutrino energy spectrum, flux and cross section are accurately known, the integral number of neutrino interactions expected within the detector can be computed for a given oscillation hypothesis and compared with the observed one. This approach is often called \"rate\" analysis. Alternatively, the relative change of rate as a function of the interaction position and neutrino energy can be compared with the expectations under different oscillation hypotheses, leaving unconstrained the integral number of events. This second approach is known as \"shape\" analysis. Rate and shape analysis are used simultaneously to maximize the experimental sensitivity, however they are affected by different systematic uncertainties and for a specific experiment only one of the two might be relevant. In the following we will discuss these two analyses separately. Results for a specific experiment can be estimated by interpolating between these two extreme cases. Experiments based on nuclear reactors sometimes use the so-called \"ratio\" method [17], in which the energy spectrum measured in a given part of the detector is normalized against what observed in a reference section. The ratio method has features similar to the shape analysis and it is not explicitly considered in the following.",

For instance, in the search for the Higgs boson, the sought-after signal is a peak over some background. The two parameters of interest are the mass of the Higgs boson, which defines the position of the peak, and its coupling with other particles, which defines the amplitude. Similarly, in the search for sterile neutrinos \u0394m 2 defines the shape of the signal and sin 2 (2\u03b8) its strength. When the Higgs boson is searched without assumptions on its mass and coupling, a test similar to T 2 is performed (i.e. a \"global p-value\" analysis). When the mass is assumed to be known, a test similar to T 1 is used (i.e. a \"local p-value\" analysis) [36]. Procedures for converting a local into a global p-value analysis have been developed in the last years [37,38] and are nowadays used to avoid the direct usage of T 2 that is computationally demanding. This procedure is known as a correction for the \"look-elsewhere effect\". We have studied the correction described in Ref. [37] and found that it does not provide accurate results for sterile neutrino experiments because of the oscillatory nature of the sought-after signature. Our studies are discussed in Appendix E.",

The exclusion sensitivity is the set of hypotheses that have a 50% chance to be excluded assuming there is no signal (H 0 is the oscillation signal for which the test has a 50% power). The discovery sensitivity is the set of hypotheses that, if true, would allow in 50% of the experiments to reject the no-signal hypothesis (H 0 is now the no-signal hypothesis).

The sensitivity for the rate analysis is higher than the total one for high \u0394m 2 values.

The same \u0394m 2 regions discussed for the disappearance experiment can be identified, even if the relative weight of the shape and rate information is different. In particular, in the appearance searches a shape analysis can provide information on \u0394m 2 but not on sin 2 (2\u03b8). The number of expected \u03bd e events is indeed proportional to the product of the oscillation amplitude sin 2 (2\u03b8) and flux of \u03bd \u03bc neutrinos. If the flux is left unconstrained in the fit, no statement can be made about the oscillation amplitude. This is the reason why the shape analysis contribution is not displayed. The rate analysis accounts for the bulk of the sensitivity and adding the shape information does not result Exclusion and discovery sensitivity at 95% CL for a toy disappearance and appearance experiment. The sensitivities are shown for the test statistics T 2 and T 1 . Whenever possible, the contribution of the shape and rate analysis are displayed separately. The discovery sensi-tivity is typically associated to a larger confidence level compared to the exclusion sensitivity, however here we use the same value to highlight their differences in a net improvement, in the sense that the slight improvement is compensated by the reduction of sensitivity due to the increased number of effective degrees of freedom discussed above. Having a sensitivity dominated by the rate analysis is typical for experiments using accelerators as neutrino source. The exclusion and discovery sensitivities are similar to each other for both the disappearance and appearance experiments. Some differences are however present. When computing the discovery sensitivity, the hypothesis tested is the no-signal hypothesis. Since sin 2 (2\u03b8) = 0 or \u0394m 2 = 0 are points at the edge of the allowed parameter space, the number of degrees of freedom of the problem decreases when testing them and the power of the test increases. The exclusion sensitivity is instead computed for values of the parameters far from the edges. This is the reason why the discovery sensitivity is in general expected to be stronger than that the exclusion one. However the situation is reversed in the shape analysis because of a peculiar feature of the sterile neutrino signature. Statistical fluctuations between bins mimic an oscillation sig-nal and the maximum of the likelihood is always found far from the no-signal hypothesis. This decreases significantly the power of the test for a discovery while it does not affect much the exclusion case. If the shape analysis dominates the overall sensitivity, as in our disappearance experiment, its features propagate also to the combined sensitivities. Figure 2c, d show the sensitivities for our toy disappearance and appearance experiments computed for T 1 . The overall features are similar to those of T 2 and the weight of the rate and shape information in the three \u0394m 2 regions are also consistent. However, since the parameter space of the alternative hypothesis is now restricted, T 1 has greater power than T 2 for a given \u0394m 2 value. This leads to sensitivities that are stronger by up to a factor 2 in terms of sin 2 (2\u03b8). This is particular evident for high \u0394m 2 values where, differently from T 2 , now the number of effective degrees of freedom in the alternative hypothesis is always one (only sin 2 (2\u03b8) is free) and the total sensitivity is equal to the one of the rate analysis. The restriction of the parameter space is also the reason why the maximum of the likelihood can now correspond to the no-signal hypothesis and the discovery sensitivity is stronger than the exclusion sensitivity even in a shape analysis.",

It is hence informative to report the observed upper limit along with its expected value and variance under the nosignal hypothesis. This has been first proposed in Ref. [8] and it is nowadays common practice. Figure 3a shows the confidence region derived with T 2 from a pseudo-data set generated for the toy disappearance experiment under the no-signal hypothesis. In addition to the confidence region, the expected distribution of the upper limit is displayed in terms of its median value and 68%/95% central intervals. The median is exactly the exclusion sensitivity plotted in Fig. 2a. The observed upper limit fluctuates around the median expectation. This is true for all possible realizations of the data as the likelihood is maximized for a specific phase of the oscillatory pattern that matches the statistical fluctuations between the bins of the data set. This phase is reproduced at regularly spaced values of \u0394m 2 over the full parameter space. The limit gets weaker when the phase helps describing the data, stronger when it does not. The overall shift of the observed limit with respect to the median value is instead due to the fact that the random number of events injected in this particular data set is slightly above its median expectation. The width of the green and yellow bands gives an idea of the magnitude of the fluctuations at a given \u0394m 2 , as they contain the upper limit on sin 2 (2\u03b8) with a probability of 68% and 95% respectively.",

In contrast to our construction, the expectation values of the nuisance parameters could also be sampled from a prior probability distribution. Ensembles generated in this way can be used to construct the probability distribution of a test statistic taking into account the systematic uncertainties on the nuisance parameters [11]. This construction leads to probability distributions that are the average over a set of models, each model having different values of the nuisance parameters and a weight proportional to the prior probability of those specific values. This construction can be considered for T 0 . In contrast, the asymptotic probability distribution for test statistics based on the profile likelihood ratio such as T 1 and T 2 does not depend on the value of the nuisance parameters.

The distributions are shown for a test of the no-signal hypothesis (panel a and b using 10 7 sets of pseudo-data) and of an oscillation hypothesis (panel c and d using 10 4 sets of pseudo-data). The oscillation hypothesis has \u0394m 2 =1 eV 2 and sin 2 (2\u03b8)=0.002/0.02/0.07, respectively for the appearance/disappearance(shape&combined)/disappearance(rate) experiment. The value of the angle is chosen such that the hypothesis is very close to the experimental sensitivity for each kind of analysis Wilks' theorem, the distributions should tend asymptotically to a chi-square function. However, considering that sin 2 (2\u03b8) is bounded to positive values, the distributions are expected to be described by a half chi-square [43]. The bottom panels show the distributions obtained when testing an oscillation hypothesis (i.e. testing an hypothesis different from the one used to generate the pseudo-data). In this case, according to Wald [46], the distributions should tend asymptotically to a non-central chi-square. In both cases the number of degrees of freedom of the chi-square function is given by the difference between the number of free parameters in the alternative and the null hypothesis. The non-centrality parameter is defined through the Asimov data set as discussed in Ref. [42].",

To reliably find the absolute minimum we adopt a scanning approach in which \u0394m 2 is increased progressively with uniform steps in the logarithmic space, each step having a length of log(\u0394m 2 /eV 2 ) 0.01. At each \u0394m 2 value a minimization against sin 2 (2\u03b8) is performed. This minimization is not problematic because, when the value of \u0394m 2 is fixed, the likelihood function along sin 2 (2\u03b8) is a smooth function with a unique minimum.",

This is the case for all the realizations of the data of the toy disappearance experiment. The sought-after oscillatory signature is indeed mimicked by the statistical fluctuations between adjacent bins and the data are described always better by an oscillation hypothesis than by the no-signal hypothesis. As discussed later in Appendix D, this leads to a deformation of the test statistic probability distribution.",
