            "text": "The transversity distribution, which describes transversely polarized quarks in transversely polarized nucleons, is a fundamental component of the spin structure of the nucleon, and is only loosely constrained by global fits to existing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data. In transversely polarized p \u2191 + p collisions it can be accessed using transverse polarization dependent fragmentation functions which give rise to azimuthal correlations between the polarization of the struck parton and the final state scalar mesons. This letter reports on spin dependent di-hadron correlations measured by the STAR experiment. The new dataset corresponds to 25 pb \u22121 integrated luminosity of p \u2191 + p collisions at \u221a s = 500 GeV, an increase of more than a factor of ten compared to our previous measurement at \u221a s = 200 GeV. Non-zero asymmetries sensitive to transversity are observed at a Q 2 of several hundred GeV and are found to be consistent with the former measurement and a model calculation. We expect that these data will enable an extraction of transversity with comparable precision to current SIDIS datasets but at much higher momentum transfers where subleading effects are suppressed.",

            "text": "The proton is the fundamental bound state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In spite of its importance for our understanding of this theory, our knowledge of the proton structure remains incomplete [1]. In particular, the proton wave function cannot be computed ab-initio in perturbative QCD (pQCD), but has to be constrained by measurements. In deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments of electrons or muons off nuclei at high energies, the wavefunction of the proton is accessed on the lightcone. In this frame, the wavefunction can be expanded in the squared 4-momentum transfer Q 2 of the interaction. The leading coefficients in this expansion can be identified with three parton distribution functions (PDFs). In the parton model, PDFs have a probabilistic interpretation as the probability of finding a parton that carries a momentum fraction x of the parent proton. The moderate Q 2 dependence, which arises from the parton splitting functions [2][3][4], is computed using evolution equations. We assume a Q 2 dependence in the following discussion even when not explicitly written. Two of the PDFs, the parton helicity averaged PDF f 1 (x), and the helicity PDF g 1 (x) appear at leading twist respectively in the spin averaged and longitudinally polarized inclusive DIS cross-section [5]. They are therefore fairly well determined experimentally [6]. The third one, the transversity distribution h 1 (x), does not appear at leading twist in the inclusive DIS cross-section since it is connected to a chiral-odd helicity-flip amplitude. Instead, it is accessed in processes where it couples to the chiral-odd transverse spin dependent fragmentation function (FF) [7]. The transversity PDF can be interpreted as the probability of finding a transversely polarized quark in a transversely polarized proton, and the FF serves as a quark polarimeter.",

            "text": "The analysis presented here investigates a channel in which transversity couples to the spin dependent di-hadron FF H 1 (z, M) [8][9][10], which, for historical reasons, is also known as the interference fragmentation function (IFF). Here, z is the fraction of the parent parton energy carried by the hadron pair, and M is the invariant mass of the pair. Presently, transversity is only loosely con- strained by fits [11,12] to available SIDIS [13][14][15][16][17] and e + e \u2212 [18,19] data. The e + e \u2212 data are necessary to constrain the polarization dependent fragmentation functions. While measurements sensitive to the unpolarized single hadron fragmentation functions have a long history (see again [7] for an overview), only recently, a result sensitive to the unpolarized di-hadron fragmentation function [20] was presented for the first time. Fixed target data are currently limited in the valence region to x < 0.2, restricting the knowledge of valence quark transversity at high x. Probing transversity in p + p collisions provides better access to the d-quark transversity than is possible in SIDIS, due to the fact that there is no charge weighting in the hard scattering QCD 2 \u2192 2 processes in p + p collisions.",

            "text": "Recently, g T has attracted increased interest. One reason is that it can be calculated precisely using lattice QCD [21][22][23][24][25], which makes it one of the few observables involving transverse polarization where experiments can be compared with first principles pQCD calculations. In fact, g T is the first nucleon matrix element that could be extrapolated to the physical limit. Furthermore, g T determines the effective tensor coupling constant for beyond the standard model contributions to low energy scattering [26]. This determination is particularly important for planned electric dipole moment experiments where a precise knowledge of g T is needed to determine the contributions of possible new CP violating phases [27]. Due to its chiral-odd property, gluon polarization contributions to transversity in a spin-1 2 target vanish [28]. This characteristic is one reason g T is dominated by the medium to high x region. Precision data from transversely polarized p + p collisions at high \u221a s and p T are crucial to access transversity at high Q 2 , where theoretical uncertainties are well under control. The kinematic region covered by the STAR experiment at these energies overlaps the reach of current SIDIS experimental data on transversity in the upper part of the covered x range (see Fig. 1). The STAR kinematics is obtained from the transverse momentum The results presented in this letter at \u221a s = 500 GeV use more than 10 times the integrated luminosity than our previously reported result at \u221a s = 200 GeV [29], where a significant signal of transversity was observed in an exploratory measurement of dipion correlations. The calculations reported in [30] found hints of universality where the phase space of the \u221a s = 200 GeV p + p and the SIDIS data overlap. Since the calculations are performed in a collinear framework, this was already postulated. However, since factorization is not proven in this process and has been explicitly shown to be broken in other transverse polarization dependent processes in p + p [31], this was a crucial finding to support the inclusion of the data in global analyses. In the future, a comparison between di-hadron asymmetries, with measurements of azimuthal asymmetries of pions in jets by STAR [32], will provide further tests of universality and factorization. The former asymmetries can be described in a collinear framework, while the latter include an explicit dependency on intrinsic transverse momenta (for more details see [33,34]). The collinear framework is well understood and describes the unpolarized p + p cross-section well [35], but the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) framework is still being developed, and questions remain about universality, factorization and evolution.",

The data used in this analysis were recorded at the STAR experiment in 2011 representing 25   the entire kinematic range. The pion pair purity is the probability that both particles in a pair are pions. The momentum, p, of each particle is required to be greater than 2 GeV/c. Each proton beam in the RHIC ring consists of bunches that alternate between being transversely polarized up or down with respect to the accelerator plane. However, when the single spin asymmetry measurement is carried out with respect to a given beam, the polarization of the other beam is integrated over to effectively be unpolarized. Polarimeters, which measure the elastic scattering of protons on ultra thin carbon ribbon targets several times during a fill, were used to measure the polarization of each beam. These polarimeters were calibrated with a polarized hydrogen gas jet target [37].",

            "text": ". (6) The scale uncertainty due to the beam polarization in this analysis is 4.5%. We investigated a potential bias of the triggered events towards pions that come from quark jets, which could result in an enhancement of the measured asymmetries, since gluons are not expected to contribute to transversity. To investigate this bias, particles produced in p + p simulated events from PYTHIA 6.426 [41] with the Perugia-0 tune [42], were processed through a detector simulator (GSTAR package based upon GEANT 3.21/08T [43]), and then used to estimate the quark/parton ratio of a biased sample over the quark/parton ratio in an unbiased sample. In STAR the trigger decision is based on the energy deposit in a defined segment in one of the calorimeters. We expect therefore that a potential trigger bias effect will be strongest for low p T parent jets, since at high jet p T the impact of a shape difference between quark or gluon initiated jets will be negligible for the trigger decision. For this reason we investigated the trigger bias as a function of the transverse momentum of the hadron pair. Within our statistical uncertainties, we do not observe a significant trigger bias and thus decided not to correct for this effect. Instead, the statistical uncertainty with which one can determine the ratio of the fractions of quark initiated jets in the triggered over the non-triggered sample was assigned as a systematic uncertainty, being \u223c20% at low p T and \u223c5% at high p T . Note that the trigger bias does not affect the statistical significance of the measurement because the scaling applies to the asymmetry and its uncertainty equally. Since the trigger efficiency is higher for larger jet energies, the selection of pion pairs might be biased towards lower z pairs. Using the same simulation as for the trigger bias, we estimate this effect to be \u223c8% at low p T and \u223c4% at high p T .   Finally, the pion pair purity previously mentioned was used to estimate the asymmetric asymmetry dilution due to \u03c0 \u2212 K and \u03c0 \u2212 p pairs and found to be about 15% and is represented as rectangles above (below) positive (negative) data points in Figs. 3-6. This estimate assumes the \u03c0 \u2212 K and \u03c0 \u2212 p asymmetries are no larger than the \u03c0 + \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetries and have the same sign.",

Fig. 7 shows a comparison of a theoretical calculation with the azimuthal asymmetry as a function of the invariant mass measured in p \u2191 + p collisions at \u221a s = 500 GeV for the highest p T bin. The gray band represents the range of the 68% confidence interval of the fit to SIDIS and e + e \u2212 data [12]. The theoretical prediction for \u221a s = 500 GeV has been provided by the authors of reference [30], which was first compared to the STAR results at \u221a s = 200 GeV [29]. The smaller M inv range for the theory band is due to the fact that this specific model calculation has only been performed up to M inv \u2248 1.2 GeV/c. The asymmetry comparison shows close agreement within statistical uncertainty between the data and the theory band, which further hints at the universality of the mechanism producing azimuthal correlations in SIDIS, e + e \u2212 , and p + p data. These high-precision \u221a s = 500 GeV results can further constrain global fits of transversity parton distribution functions to SIDIS, e + e \u2212 , and p + p data, and in particular, improve the statistical significance for x > 0.1.",

These data show significant signals at high p T and M inv for \u03b7 > 0. IFF models predict an enhancement around the \u03c1 mass due to the interference of vector meson decays in a relative p-wave with the non-resonant background in a relative s-wave. This prediction is consistent with the data reported in the paper. These data probe transversity at much higher Q 2 \u2248 400 GeV 2 and sample a different mixture of quark flavors compared to the charge weighted coupling in SIDIS. These results can be used to test the universality of the mechanism producing azimuthal correlations in SIDIS, e + e \u2212 , and p + p. In the future, a comparison between di-hadron asymmetries with measurements of azimuthal asymmetries of pions in jets will provide further tests of universality and factorization. Additionally, the high-precision of these results, can further constrain global fits to world data, especially in the region",
