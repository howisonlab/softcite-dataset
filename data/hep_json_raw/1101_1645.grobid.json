The data sample was collected with the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb \u22121 . Momentum and ionization-energy-loss measurements in the inner tracker detector are used to identify tracks compatible with heavy slow-moving particles. Additionally, tracks passing muon identification requirements are also analyzed for the same signature. In each case, no candidate passes the selection, with an expected background of less than 0.1 events. A lower limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of a stable gluino is set at 398 GeV/c 2 , using a conventional model of nuclear interactions that allows charged hadrons containing this particle to reach the muon detectors. A lower limit of 311 GeV/c 2 is also set for a stable gluino in a conservative scenario of complete charge suppression, where any hadron containing this particle becomes neutral before reaching the muon detectors.",

If the lifetime of an HSCP produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is longer than a few nanoseconds, the particle will travel over distances that are comparable or larger than the size of a typical particle detector. In addition, if the HSCP mass is 100 GeV/c 2 , a significant fraction of these particles will have a velocity, \u03b2 \u2261 v/c, smaller than 0.9. These HSCPs will be directly observable through the distinctive signature of a high momentum (p) particle with an anomalously large rate of energy loss through ionization (dE/dx).",

            "text": "Previous collider searches for HSCPs have often been performed under the assumption that these particles lose energy primarily through low-momentum-transfer interactions, even if they are strongly interacting, and are therefore likely to reach the outer muon systems of the detectors and be identified as muons [9][10][11][12][13]. The interactions with matter experienced by a strongly-interacting HSCP, which is expected to form a bound state (Rhadron) [14] in the process of hadronization, can lead to it flipping the sign of its electric charge or becoming neutral. A recent study [15] on the modeling of nuclear interactions of HSCPs traveling through matter, favours a scenario of charge suppression. In this model the majority of R-hadrons containing a gluino, g (the supersymmetric partner of the gluon), or a supersymmetric bottom squark, are expected to emerge as neutral particles after traversing an amount of material typical of the detectors operating at LEP, the Tevatron, or LHC. If this model is correct, the majority of these HSCPs would not be observed in the muon system of a typical collider detector. Experimental strategies that do not rely on the muon-like behavior for the HSCPs are therefore of great importance. For instance, searches have been performed for very slow (\u03b2 0.4) R-hadrons containing a gluino brought to rest in the detector [16,17].",

The search is based on the data sample collected between April and August 2010 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb \u22121 . We use triggers requiring: a high-transverse-momentum muon (p T > 9 GeV/c); or a dimuon pair (p T > 3 GeV/c for each muon); or calorimeterbased missing transverse energy (E miss T > 100 GeV), to search for HSCPs failing muon identification or emerging mainly as neutral particles after traversing the calorimeters; or a high-transverse-energy jet (E T > 100 GeV) to search for HSCPs accompanied by substantial hadronic activity. The analysis makes use of two approaches. In a first selection, referred to as \"tracker-only\", the HSCP candidates are searched for as individual tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker detector with large dE/dx and p T . A second selection, referred to as \"tracker-plus-muon\", additionally requires that the track is identified as a muon in the outer muon detector. For both selections, the mass of the candidate is calculated from the measured p and dE/dx.",

Muons are measured in gaseous detectors embedded in the iron return yoke. Centrally produced charged particles are measured in the tracker by three layers of silicon pixel detectors, followed by ten microstrip layers. At pseudorapidities (\u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is the polar angle measured with respect to the beam direction) above \u2248 1.5, particles are tracked in two pixel and twelve strip layers arranged in disks perpendicular to the beam axis. In this analysis, the dE/dx measurement is based only on the information from the silicon strip detectors. The dE/dx measurement precision is limited by the silicon strip analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) modules that are characterized by a maximum number of counts per channel corresponding to about three times the average charge released by a minimum-ionizing particle (MIP) in 300 \u00b5m of silicon. This is the thickness of the modules mounted in the innermost silicon strip central layers. The p T resolution for tracks measured in the central (forward) region of the silicon tracker is 1% (2%) for p T values up to 50 GeV/c and degrades to 10% (20%) at p T values of 1 TeV/c. The trigger and reconstruction efficiencies for HSCPs in the muon detectors are limited by the requirements on the arrival time of the particles at the muon system. These requirements affect the efficiency for detecting slow HSCPs. The dependence of the muon trigger efficiency on the particle velocity is studied using data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and found to decrease, below \u03b2 = 0.7. The muon trigger becomes completely inefficient at \u03b2 = 0.5. A much more detailed description of the CMS apparatus can be found elsewhere [18].",

Candidate tracks are also required to have at least three measurements in the silicon-strip detector. For the tracker-plus-muon selection, we additionally require the track to be compatible with track segments reconstructed in the muon system. As an estimator of the degree of compatibility of the observed charge measurements with the MIP hypothesis, a modified version of the Smirnov-Cramer-von Mises [19,20] discriminant is used: 1) where N is the number of charge measurements in the silicon-strip detectors, P i is the probability for a MIP to produce a charge smaller or equal to the i-th charge measurement for the observed path length in the detector, and the sum is over the track measurements ordered in terms of increasing P i . Non-relativistic HSCP candidates will have the value of the discriminant I as approaching unity. The modification applied to the original form of the discriminant consists of multiplicating by P i the term in round brackets. In this way the I as value for tracks reconstructed with an anomalously low dE/dx, which may result from rare accidental associations of noise signals, is pushed toward low values. Thus the modification eliminates the sensitivity of the original discriminant to incompatibility with the MIP hypothesis due to low ionization. The charge probability density function used to calculate P i is obtained using tracks with p > 5 GeV/c in events collected with a minimum bias trigger. Figure 1 shows normalized distributions of p T and I as in data and two MC samples, for candidates passing the tracker-only pre-selection. The first MC sample contains events from QCD processes. The second MC sample contains signal events from pair-production of stable g with a mass of 200 GeV/c 2 . Both samples are generated with the pythia v6.422 [21] MC package. More details on the simulation of the signal sample will be given below. The MC QCD simulations are found to reproduce the data, and the simulated signal is clearly separated. Because of the limited number of available simulated events with low transverse-momentum transfers, the MC QCD distributions display bin-to-bin variations in the size of the statistical errors. The most probable value of the particle dE/dx is determined using a harmonic estimator I h of grade k = \u22122:",

The reconstructed mass distribution for kaons and protons is in very good agreement with the one obtained from MC following this procedure [23]. For masses above 100 GeV/c 2 , the mass resolution is expected to worsen because of the deterioration of the momentum resolution and because of the limit on the maximum charge that can be measured by the silicon strip tracker ADCs, which also affects the mass scale. These effects are taken into account by the MC: for a 300 GeV/c 2 HSCP, the mass resolution and the reconstructed peak position are found to be 12% and 265 GeV/c 2 , respectively.",

Signal candidates are required to have I as and p T greater than threshold values and the mass to be in the range of 75 to 2000 GeV/c 2 , allowing sensitivity to HSCP masses as low as 100 GeV/c 2 . The I as distribution for the pre-selected tracks, and in particular its tail, depends strongly on the number of charge measurements on the track. Thus, to increase the sensitivity of the search, pre-selected tracks are divided into subsamples according to the number of silicon strip measurements. Tracks with 18 measurements or more are merged into a single subsample. Tracks with a number of measurements in the range of 3 to 8 are also merged into a single subsample. In total 11 subsamples are formed whose populations do not differ by more than a factor of five. The I as (p T ) threshold in each subsample is determined by requiring a constant efficiency on data for all subsamples, when the threshold is applied separately. A method that exploits the absence of correlation between the p T and dE/dx measurements in data is used to estimate the background from MIPs. In a given subsample j, the number of tracks that are expected to pass both the final p T and I as thresholds set for the subsample is estimated as D j = B j C j /A j , where A j is the number of tracks that JHEP03 (2011)024fail both the I as and p T selections and B j (C j ) is the number of tracks that pass only the I as (p T ) selection. The B j and C j tracks are then used to form a binned probability density function in I h (p) for the D j tracks. Finally, using the mass determination (eq. 3.3), the full mass spectrum of the background in the signal region D is predicted.",

The R-hadron strong interactions with matter are modeled as in ref. [26,27]. This model, like a number of others [15,[28][29][30], assumes that the probability of an interaction between the heavy parton and a quark in the target nucleon is low since the cross section varies with the inverse square of the parton mass according to perturbative QCD. The adopted model chooses a pragmatic approach based on analogy with observed low energy hadron scattering. However, given the very large uncertainties on the dynamics underlying R-hadron interactions, an extremely pessimistic scenario of complete charge suppression, where each nuclear interaction suffered by the R-hadron causes it to become neutral, is also considered.

However, in this analysis we have conservatively chosen to retain the earlier estimate of 10%. The uncertainty on the muon trigger efficiency and the imperfect simulation of the synchronization of the muon trigger and readout electronics are studied with data and MC and are found to be the second most important source of systematic uncertainty. The total uncertainty on the trigger efficiency is 12%. The uncertainty on the offline muon track reconstruction efficiency [33], offline track reconstruction efficiency in the inner tracker [34], track momentum scale [35] and ionization energy loss scale [23] is also found to yield no more than 5% uncertainty on the overall signal selection efficiency.

Total signal selection efficiency and cross section upper limits for different combinations of models and selections: pair production of supersymmetric stop and gluinos; tracker-plus-muon (Mu) and tracker-only (Tk) selections; different fractions, f , of R-gluonball states produced after hadronization and charge suppression (ch. suppr.) scenario.  JHEP03 (2011)024in table 2 and figure 3, along with the theoretical predictions for g andt 1 pair production computed at next-to-leading order (NLO) + next-to-leading log (NLL) [37][38][39][40] using the prospino v2 program [41]. The g theoretical predictions refer to the case where the squarks and gluino are degenerate in mass. In the heavy squark limit these cross sections are about 10% higher. For the case oft 1 , beyond LO, the cross section does not only depend on thet 1 mass, but also, though to a much lesser extent [42], on the g mass, the average mass of the first and second generation squarks and the stop mixing angle. For this reason, thet 1 theoretical predictions reported in table 2 and figure 3 refer to the SPS1a' benchmark scenario [43]. All systematic uncertainties discussed above are included in the cross section upper limits reported in table 2 and figure 3. From the intersection of the cross section limit curve and the lower edge of the theoretical cross section band we set a 95% C.L. lower limit of 398 (357) GeV/c 2 on the mass of pair-produced g with f = 0.1(0.5), using the tracker-plus-muon selection. The analogous limit on thet 1 mass is 202 GeV/c 2 . In the charge suppression scenario we set, with the tracker-only selection, a 95% C.L. g mass limit of 311 GeV/c 2 for f = 0.1.",

            "text": "In summary, the CMS detector has been used to identify highly ionizing, high-p T particles and measure their masses. Two searches have been conducted: a very inclusive and model independent one that uses highly-ionizing tracks reconstructed in the inner tracker detector, and another requiring also that these tracks be identified in the CMS muon system. In each case, the observed distribution of the candidate masses is consistent with the expected background. We have set lower limits on masses of stable strongly interacting supersymmetric particles. For the case of g with f = 0.1 andt 1 , a lower mass limit of 398 and 202 GeV/c 2 , respectively, is set at the 95% C.L. with the analysis that uses muon identification. In a pessimistic scenario of complete charge suppression the above g mass limit is reduced to 311 GeV/c 2 and is obtained with the tracker-only selection. The limits presented here on stable g are the most restrictive to date.  Figure 3. Predicted theoretical cross section and observed 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section for the different combinations of models and scenarios considered: pair production of supersymmetric stop and gluinos; different fractions, f , of R-gluonball states produced after hadronization and charge suppression (\"ch. suppr.\") scenarios. Only the results obtained with the most sensitive selection are reported: tracker-only for the charge suppression scenarios and tracker-plus-muon for all other cases. The bands represent the theoretical uncertainties on the cross section values.",
