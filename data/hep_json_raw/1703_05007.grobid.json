Observation of any such decay would be a direct signature of physics beyond the SM. Large enhancements are possible in many \"new physics\" scenarios and the largest enhancement is in most cases expected for the t \u2192 cH decay. A full study for CLIC was based on the WHIZARD simulation of FCNC top decays within the 2HDM(III) model. Beam polarization and beam-induced background were taken into account. Top pair production events with the FCNC decay t \u2192 cH can be identified based on kinematic constrains and flavour tagging information. Due to a large overlap in the kinematic space with standard top pair events, the final signal selection-efficiency is small, at the 10% level. Expected limits on BR(t \u2192 cH) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 bb) are compared with earlier results based on parton level simulation.",

As the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, with an expected value of the Yukawa coupling of the order of one, the precise determination of its properties is a key to the understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking. Determination of top properties is also essential for many \"new physics\" searches, as the top quark gives large loop contributions to many precision measurements sensitive to BSM effects. Stringent constraints on the \"new physics\" scenarios are also expected from direct searches for rare top decays. Both future linear colliders, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), provide an opportunity to study the top quark with unprecedented precision via direct production of tt pairs in e + e \u2212 collisions. Presented in this contribution are prospects of constraining the branching ratio for the flavour changing top decay t \u2192 cH with CLIC running at \u221a s = 380 GeV.",

            "text": "The Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for CLIC was presented in 2012 [1]. CLIC is based on a twobeam acceleration scheme, required to generate a high RF gradient of about 100 MV/m. In the recently updated implementation plan for CLIC [2], a construction in three stages is proposed, with 5 to 7 years of data taking at each stage. The first stage with a footprint of 11 km will allow one to reach a centerof-mass energy of 380 GeV, giving access to most Higgs boson and top quark measurements. The plan assumes collecting 500 fb \u22121 at 380 GeV with additional 100 fb \u22121 collected at the tt threshold. The CLIC baseline design includes polarisation for the electron beam, while positron polarisation is considered as a possible upgrade. The detector concepts proposed for CLIC are based on jet reconstruction and jet energy measurements with the \"Particle Flow\" approach [3]. Single particle reconstruction and identification exploits high calorimeter granularity, and the best possible jet energy estimate is obtained by combining calorimetric measurements of neutral particles with precise track momentum measurements for the charged ones. Very efficient flavour tagging is possible with a high precision pixel vertex detector placed very close to the interaction point. The background to processes with missing energy can be strongly suppressed thanks to very good detector hermeticity, with instrumentation extending down to a minimum angle of \u03b8 min \u223c 10 mrad. Presented in this contribution are detailed simulation results based on the ILD detector concept adopted for CLIC [4].",

Only charged current decays are allowed at the tree level and the loop level contributions are suppressed by the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [5]. The cancellation is not perfect because of the non-zero down-quark masses and the dominant contribution to the FCNC decays comes from diagrams including a b quark in the loop. The corresponding partial widths are proportional to the square of the element V cb of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [6,7] and to the fourth power of the b quark to the W boson mass ratio.

The enhancement can be due to the direct tree level FCNC coupling, but in most models it is observed at the loop level and results from contributions of new particles or from the modified particle couplings. The decay t \u2192 cH seems to be the most promising channel, as most BSM scenarios predict significant deviation in the (light) Higgs boson couplings or contributions from the additional Higgs bosons to the loop diagrams. For the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which is one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model, loop contributions can be enhanced up to the level of BR \u223c 10 \u22124 [9]. For the \"non standard\" scenarios, 2HDM(III) or \"Top 2HDM\", where one of the Higgs doublets couples to the top quark only, tree level FCNC couplings are also allowed and an enhancement up to 10 \u22122 is possible [10]. The t \u2192 cH decay is also difficult to constrain at the LHC, because of the high QCD background to the dominating Higgs boson decay channels. The expected limit from HL-LHC is BR(t \u2192 cH) < 2 \u2022 10 \u22124 [8,11].",

The \u03c7 2 formula for both cases included constraints on the masses of two top candidates, W mass constraint and the Higgs boson or second W mass constraint. The final selection was based on the ratio of the \u03c7 2 values for best signal and best background hypothesis. The selection was optimised so as to obtain the highest sensitivity to the FCNC decays.

Before any selection cuts (figure 4a), the background level is three orders of magnitude higher than the signal one (which corresponds to the assumed branching ratio for the FCNC decays).

Also, the shape of the \u2206 log 10 \u03c7 2 distribution is very similar for signal and background samples, showing that the kinematic fit itself is not sufficient for signal identification. The kinematic reconstruction is clearly not precise enough. Only after very tight cuts on the flavour tagging probabilities for the three b-quark jets and c jet, signal events can be selected with a reasonable purity (figure 4d).

For consistency, parton level results presented on these figures were obtained considering the hadronic decay channel only. The sensitivity of CLIC running at 380 GeV to FCNC top decays turns out to be significantly weaker than the one estimated from the parton level study, even assuming the worst (pessimistic) jet energy resolution. This is due to the much weaker discrimination power of the kinematic fit. Invariant mass resolutions for two-and three-jet configurations in the final state (W and top candiates), as obtained from the full simulation study, are not well described by the Gaussian distributions. Deterioration of the energy and mass resolution for the hadronic final state can be due to the large fraction of b jets in the considered sample as well as to the influence of the overlaid beam background. With the required background suppression factor of the order of 10 \u22124 , tails of the mass distributions become very important and result in a significant fraction of background events fitting signal hypothesis better (two jets from W decay looking like H candidate). These events can only be suppressed by very tight flavour tagging cuts, but this reduces also the signal  figure 6, indicates that the performance of the kinematic fit should improve when going to higher centre-of-mass energies. At \u221a s = 380 GeV, top quarks are produced almost at rest and their decay products can easily mix.
