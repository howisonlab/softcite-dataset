(The decay B \u2192 DK refers to B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , B \u00b1 \u2192 D * K \u00b1 , B \u00b1 \u2192 DK * \u00b1 , and B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 decays.) The Atwood-Dunietz-Soni (ADS) method [3] suggests to study flavored charm decays, e.g., D \u2192 K\u03c0, K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0, and K\u03c0\u03c0 0 , while Giri et al. [4] and Bondar and Poluektov [5] suggest to study D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays using a binned model-independent method. In these proceedings, I present the measurements from the CLEO collaboration of the strong phase in D \u2192 K\u03c0 decays, coherence factors for D \u2192 K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 and D \u2192 K\u03c0\u03c0 0 decays, and D 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays using a binned Dalitz plot analysis. Measurements of these quantities are possible due to the D 0 D 0 pair from \u03c8(3770) decays being produced in a quantum correlated state [6], i.e., the D 0 and D 0 have opposite CP since the parent \u03c8(3770) has C = -1.",
