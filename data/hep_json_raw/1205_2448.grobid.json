The instantaneous luminosity is defined as where f is the revolution frequency for the two colliding particles p 1 and p 2 , n is the number of colliding bunches per revolution, and N 1 (N 2 ) is the number of particles of type p 1 (p 2 ) per bunch. The effective cross section of the beams is A. The time-integrated luminosity L relates the cross section \u03c3 p 1 p 2 \u2192X of the reaction p 1 p 2 \u2192 X to the number of events N p 1 p 2 \u2192X expected in the time interval T by",

            "text": "Since it is difficult to monitor all beam parameters with a per cent level precision, in particular those defining the effective beam cross section A, the integrated luminosity is often determined by counting the number of observed events for a specific reaction p 1 p 2 \u2192 X with a well-known cross section. At HERA, the colliding beams are protons and electrons. 1 For the data taking period studied in this analysis, the proton beam energy is E 0 p = 920 GeV and the electron beam energy is E 0 e = 27.6 GeV. The reaction used to determine the integrated luminosity is the production of a radiative photon in elastic ep scattering, ep \u2192 e\u03b3p. Depending on the phase space considered, this process is referred to as Bethe-Heitler (BH) scattering or QED Compton (QEDC) scattering. In the BH process [1], both the electron and the photon are emitted almost collinearly to the incident electron. The corresponding cross section is very large, O(100 mb). Dedicated small angle detectors are used to record BH events. In contrast, for QEDC scattering [2][3][4][5], the particles have a sizable transverse momentum with respect to the incident electron and can be detected in the main detector. The momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex, t, is generally small. At very small momentum transfer |t| 1 GeV 2 , elastic scattering dominates. At |t| 1 GeV 2 , inelastic processes are relevant and the reaction is sensitive to the proton structure. In addition, there are quasi-elastic contributions to the cross section, where the outgoing proton forms an excited state, like + or N , which then decays to a low mass hadronic system. Within the phase space considered in this analysis, the elastic QEDC cross section is O(50 pb).",

            "text": "At HERA, the integrated luminosity is usually measured in the BH process, using dedicated detectors located at small angles. The advantage of this process is its very large cross section, thus negligible statistical uncertainties are achieved for small amounts of integrated luminosity. However, there are various sources of possibly large systematic uncertainty. For example, there may be inevitable acceptance limitations for the small angle detectors, caused by elements of the beam transport system which separates the BH photons and electrons from the circulating proton and electron beams. The acceptances of the photon and electron detectors may exhibit complex spatial structures and can vary in time as well. Another complication originates from synchrotron radiation emitted by the electron beam as it passes the focusing magnets surrounding the interaction region. Furthermore ep collisions can happen also outside the nominal interaction region. These contribute to the BH measurement of the integrated luminosity, but must be corrected for when analysing cross sections with the H1 main detector, which has a more limited acceptance as a function of the collision point position.",

DVCS is modelled using the MILOU event generator [21]. Diffractive VM production is simulated using the DIFFVM event generator [22], where the production of \u03c1 0 , \u03c9, \u03c6, J /\u03c8, \u03c8 and \u03a5 mesons is considered. For \u03c1 0 production, DIF-FVM is modified such that decays to \u03c0 0 \u03b3 and \u03b7 0 \u03b3 are included. Non-resonant diffraction is simulated using the RAPGAP event generator [23]. Background from nondiffractive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) is simulated using DJANGO [24] and is found to be negligible. The elastic QEDC events are selected offline by requiring two clusters in the electromagnetic section of the SpaCal. A summary of the selection criteria is given in Table 1. The transverse sizes of the SpaCal clusters are restricted to R log < 6 cm, where R log is calculated from the SpaCal cell centres using logarithmic energy weighting [12]. The cluster energies are required to be larger than 2.2 GeV. In the range 30 \u2264 R < 72 cm of the radial distance from the beam, R, exactly two such clusters are required, whereas for 20 \u2264 R < 30 cm no cluster is allowed. The restriction in the number of clusters removes background and events with hard radiative photons. The restriction R \u2265 30 cm on the two clusters ensures that the particles are within the CIP acceptance.",

For this generated phase space, the cross section is \u03c3 gen = 54.8 pb. A total fraction of f vtx = 2.5 % of the generated events have a simulated vertex position along the z coordinate, z gen , outside \u00b135 cm around the nominal vertex position, in order to be able to describe the observed longitudinal vertex distribution in the H1 detector. Within the region |z gen | < 35 cm the reconstruction efficiency is found to be rec = 64.7 %. The sources of inefficiency are investigated in the following. Losses of 12.4 % originate from the cut in | P miss T | due to the limited experimental resolution. The requirement 30 < R < 72 cm on the radial SpaCal cluster position reduces the efficiency by 7.2 %. This loss is related to a geometrical effect, such that particles originating from z gen > 0 (z gen < 0) and scattered at polar angles near 155.9 \u2022 (169.5 \u2022 ) are outside the allowed range in R. The track and calorimeter veto conditions contribute to the inefficiency by 3.4 %, dominated by the restriction in forward LAr energy and the veto on additional SpaCal clusters. The LAr condition is not fully efficient due to electronic noise and overlap with non ep background. The inefficiency due to a third SpaCal cluster originates from events with hard final state radiation. Losses due to the other selection criteria are small (1.8 % total). Finally, 10.5 % are rejected by more than one selection criterion, where combinations involving the | P miss T | condition dominate. A detailed breakdown of the different background sources contributing to the elastic QEDC selection as defined in Table 1 is given in Table 2 without and with applying the | P miss T | cut. More than half of the background originates from inelastic and quasi-elastic QEDC processes. The | P miss T | cut significantly reduces the background by about a factor of three. ",

The other trigger conditions are related to timing signals from the VETO system and from the SpaCal calorimeter, designed to veto non ep background.

For the QEDC analysis, multiplicative calibration factors are applied to the SpaCal cluster energies for electrons, non-converted photons and converted photons, respectively.

An energy offset E = (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c4 ) E 0 e /2 is subtracted, where \u03b4 is a random number drawn from an exponential distribution, i.e. the probability density to find \u03b4 > 0 is given by f (\u03b4) = 1/\u03c4 exp[\u2212\u03b4/\u03c4 ]. By construction, E \u223c (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c4 ) has an expectation value of E = 0. This has the desired effect that the peak position of P T /P T ,DA is affected only little by the smearing. Two independent parameters \u03c4 e and \u03c4 \u03b3 are foreseen to describe the expectation values of the exponential probability distributions for electrons and photons, respectively. It turns out that both \u03c4 e and \u03c4 \u03b3 take the same central value, \u03c4 e = \u03c4 \u03b3 = 0.010. Figure 3a shows that the distribution of P T ,e /P T ,DA is described by the smeared simulation within a variation of the smearing parameter \u03c4 e = 0.010 \u00b1 0.005. Similarly, for photons, P T ,\u03b3 /P T ,DA (Fig. 3b) is described within the variation \u03c4 \u03b3 = 0.010 \u00b1 0.005. The \u03c4 e and \u03c4 \u03b3 variations together cause an uncertainty on L QEDC of 1.1 %.",

For these events, extra CIP clusters near the expected position are added, and the energy response is scaled to match the expectation for converted photons. For estimating systematic effects, the three CIP related corrections described above are switched off one by one, and the resulting differences on L QEDC are taken as uncertainties.

Improved higher order corrections have been calculated [31] using a photon radiator [32]. For the purpose of this analysis, the COMPTON22 events are assigned weights, determined such that the cross section predicted by the photon radiator method is reproduced. The difference of 1.0 % to the original COMPTON22 prediction is taken as systematic uncertainty due to higher order effects. The elastic QEDC cross section also depends on the proton electric and magnetic form factors. In the original COMPTON22 generator, only a simple parametrisation of the form factors, using one parameter, is implemented. For this analysis, recent form-factor fits of elastic ep scattering data [33] are taken into account, using an event weighting technique. The formfactor parameterisations [33] are corrected for the effects of two-photon exchange (TPE), but parameterisations not including TPE corrections are also provided. In the COMP-TON22 generator, TPE contributions are not included when calculating the cross-section. For this reason the form factor parameterisations not including TPE corrections are used to calculate elastic QEDC cross sections [34]. When computing the COMPTON22 cross section with the TPE corrected form factors, the analysis result changes by 0.1 %. This difference is included as systematic uncertainty. Experimental uncertainties on the form factor parametrisation are also considered. Such uncertainties are available with the parametrisation [35,36] which includes TPE corrections. It has been verified that the difference between [35,36] and [33] is completely negligible for the purpose of this analysis if the TPE corrections are included. The experimental uncertainties on the form factors G E (|t|) and G M (|t|) approach zero for |t| \u2192 0, because the parameterisations enforce G E (0) = 1 and G M (0) = \u03bc p . At |t| = 0.007, which is the average momentum transfer predicted for the events selected in this analysis, the uncertainties on G E (G M ) are 0.1 % (0.2 %). The elastic QEDC cross section at fixed |t| is given by a linear combination of G 2 E (|t|) and G 2 M (|t|), where the G 2 E contribution dominates at small |t|. When propagating the |t| dependent parametrisation uncertainties on G E and G M to the luminosity measurement, an uncertainty of 0.2 % is found. In addition to the theory uncertainties related to higher order corrections and proton form factors, discussed above, there is a statistical uncertainty on the theory prediction originating from the finite size of the generated signal event sample. It amounts to 0.3 %.",

            "text": "In order to apply the integrated luminosity L QEDC to other physics analyses, possibly using time restricted H1 data sets, a luminosity calculation differential in time is required. This is achieved using DIS events measured in the SpaCal. The DIS selection follows the selection described in [25] but is restricted in electron polar angle to the range 167 \u2022 < \u03b8 e < 172 \u2022 such that the expected event yield is most insensitive to changing beam conditions, in particular to the average position of the interaction vertex in z. In addition, the electron energy range is restricted to 15 < E < 25 GeV and the electron transverse cluster size to R log < 4.5 cm. The longitudinal vertex position, measured in the CTD, is restricted to be within \u00b135 cm around the nominal interaction point. The DIS event counts for each run 3 are used to define relative integrated luminosities of the runs, and the overall normalisation is taken from the QEDC analysis. The statistical uncertainty of the DIS selection is negligible, but it has a time-dependent systematic error of 1.5 %. This uncertainty originates mainly from the SpaCal trigger and vertex reconstruction efficiencies [25]. Figure 7 shows the results of the elastic QEDC analysis performed in bins of about 25 pb \u22121 , normalised to the global QEDC analysis with the DIS yield corrections applied. Four data taking periods, corresponding to distinct configurations of the HERA machine or the H1 3 H1 data are grouped into runs, where new runs are started whenever data taking conditions changed. A run typically spans about 30 minutes of data, equivalent to an integrated luminosity of about 30 nb \u22121 . Fig. 7 Integrated luminosity measured from elastic QEDC events in bins of approximately 25 pb \u22121 , divided by the integrated luminosity derived from the QEDC analysis on the full sample with time-dependent corrections applied. The statistical uncertainties of the binned QEDC analysis as well as the uncertainties of the time-dependent corrections, here applied to four data taking periods (I)-(IV), are indicated detector, are indicated. The HERA machine has been operated with e + p beams for periods (I) and (IV) and with e \u2212 p beams for period (II) and (III). The H1 detector has been opened for the repair or upgrade of various components between period (I) and (II) as well as between period (II) and (III). The two methods of measuring differential in time are in good agreement, taking into account the statistical fluctuations of the time-dependent QEDC analysis and the timedependent systematic uncertainties of the DIS yield method.",
