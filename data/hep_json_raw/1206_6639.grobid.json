The signal under study is direct WIMP pair production with associated initial state radiation e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7\u03b3. The analysis accounts for the beam energy spectrum of the ILC and the dominant machine induced backgrounds. The influence of the detector parameters are incorporated by full simulation and event reconstruction within the framework of the ILD detector concept. We show that by using polarised beams, the detection potential is significantly increased by reduction of the dominant SM background of radiative neutrino production e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are the precision of the polarisation measurement and the shape of the beam energy spectrum. With an integrated luminosity of L = 500 fb \u22121 the helicity structure of the interaction involved can be inferred, and the masses and cross-sections can be measured with a relative accuracy of the order of 1%.",

Complementary to direct and indirect detection experiments which look for signals of primordial WIMPs, colliders could produce WIMP particles under laboratory conditions. Since the WIMPs themselves leave collider experiments undetected due to their weak interaction with matter, collider searches typically rely on WIMPs appearing in cascade decays of more heavy exotic particles, thus assuming a specific extension of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM).",

            "text": "Direct WIMP production does not depend on the existence or kinematical accessibility of additional new particles. However it can be observed only when accompanied by wideangle initial state radiation (ISR). It has been shown [1] that for annihilation cross-sections compatible with the relic abundance of dark matter, the cross-section for radiative WIMP production at an electron-positron Linear Collider can be sufficiently large to observe this process above the irreducible background from radiative neutrino production. The energy spectrum of the ISR photon can be exploited to extract information on the WIMP mass and cross-section. The resulting discovery reach and mass resolutions have been studied before assuming either supersymmetric extension of the SM or the presence of universal extra-dimensions [2]. In both cases the new partners of the electron can be exchanged in the t-channel and thus impact the shape of the photon energy spectrum. Based on four-vector smearing and taking into account the radiative neutrino background and an overall systematic uncertainty of 0.3%, the two cases can be distinguished for a large range of the parameter space, and the mass of the electron partner can be measured far beyond the kinematic limit for its direct production. However, the shape of the photon spectra from signal and SM background are expected to be significantly distorted by various effects related to the detector, the reconstruction and the accelerator. The observation reach for the single photon signature at the International Linear Collider (ILC) has been investigated in full detector simulation in [3]. Considering the statistical uncertainty only and assuming fully polarised beams, it has been shown that with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb \u22121 cross-sections down to about 12 fb can be observed at the 5\u03c3 level.",

Both distributions are normalised to the number of tracks expected from these processes per bunch crossing (BX), i.e. 0.7 tracks/BX from \u03b3\u03b3 processes and 1.5 tracks/BX from e + e \u2212 pairs. In the analysis, events containing any track with p T > 3 GeV are vetoed. The remaining probability to falsely reject a signal event due to an overlayed background track is about 0.25%. In addition to the track veto, events with other neutral particles are rejected by requiring that the total visible energy of the event must not exceed the recontructed photon energy by more than 20 GeV. The low angle calorimeters complement the hermeticity of the detector, leaving only holes of 4.5 mrad and 5.6 mrad in the polar angle coverage of the BeamCal around the incoming and outgoing beams, respectively. The innermost part of the BeamCal is exposed to energy depositions of several TeV per bunch crossing from e + e \u2212 pairs created by Beamstrahlung processes. Isolated high energy electrons (or photons) can be detected above this background with efficiencies larger than 80% for angles above typically 20 mrad from the detector z axis 2 [13]. The complete angular and energy dependence of this efficiency has been taken into account in the simulation. This is crucial in order to obtain a correct estimate of the background from radiative Bhabha scattering, since vetoing such isolated high energy electrons in the BeamCal is mandatory to reduce the Bhabha background to a manageable level.  Table 2: Number of events for the main background processes at the different selection stages for an integrated luminosity of L = 1 fb \u22121 and (P e \u2212 ; P e + ) = (+0.0; +0.0). The second column contains the event numbers in the analysis phace space. The third column lists the event numbers after the cuts on the energy and polar angle of the reconstructed photon. The last column lists the selection efficiencies. Table 2 illustrates the effect of the selection cuts for the case of unpolarised beams. Beam polarisation significantly reduces or enhances the rates for the neutrino processes while leaving the Bhabha rate at the same level. The final selection efficiency for the missing energy plus photon signature is near 90%. In real data, this efficiency could be controlled from the high energy part of the photon energy spectrum which contains the radiative return to the Z and is not used in the WIMP analysis as well as from radiative muon pair production \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3. From the statistics available in these two processes, we estimate the systematic uncertainty on the selection efficiency to 1.5%. In addition, the impact of the cut on the reconstructed photon energy depends slightly on the WIMP mass. Based on the accuracies on the WIMP mass achieved in this study, this translates into an additional sytematic effect on the selection efficiency. Added in quadrature, both effects together yield a total systematic uncertainty of 1.75% on the selection efficiency. The photon energy spectrum obtained after all selection cuts is displayed in Figure 6(a) for Standard Model background (red) and for a WIMP signal (green; M \u03c7 = 150 GeV, p-wave). The distributions are normalised to an integrated luminosity of 50 fb \u22121 and beam polarisations of (P e \u2212 ; P e + ) = (+0.8; \u22120.3). The \"data\" points are obtained from a statistically independent Monte-Carlo sample assuming the presence of background and signal. Figure 6(b) shows the \"data\" after subtracting the expected background compared to the signal expectation (green). The size of the statistical errors of the \"data\" points reflects the fluctuations of the large amount of subtracted background.",

The WIMP mass is determined by comparing template photon energy spectra for background and signals of different masses against the \"data\" spectrum and by searching the mass for which the \u03c7 2 is minimised. This method is much more powerful than a mere determination of the maximal photon energy, because near the endpoint of the spectrum the signal is buried in the fluctuations of the huge Standard Model background, as can be seen in Figure 6(b).",

            "text": "[GeV] The shape of the photon energy spectrum below the endpoint however also depends on the dominant partial wave of the production, c.f. However the correct assumption on the dominant partial wave can be easily determined over the full WIMP mass range by comparing the \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of the template fits if positron polarisation is available. This can be seen in Figure 10, where the \u03c7 2 /ndf is displayed as a function of the true WIMP mass for the right and wrong partial wave hypothesis. In the upper row, the positron polarisation is set to |P e + | = 0, and in this case no convincing difference in the \u03c7 2 values is obtained. For |P e + | = 30% (middle row) and |P e + | = 60% (bottom row), the wrong assumption yields a \u03c7 2 /ndf significantly larger than unity. Since for this test it is crucial to have a simulated sample corresponding to the actually assumed intergrated luminosity, the limited amount of events available from full simulation has been augmented by a fast simulation sample obtained from an ILD version of SGV [14] for this (and only this) figure.",

The former has been estimated from a comparison to fits with templates based on the beam energy spectrum obtained with the SB2009 beam parameter set. Conservatively, the full resulting shift in measured mass is included in the systematic errors quoted here. Thus the uncertainty of the mass measurement can be reduced by determining the beam parameters, for instance from the shape of the energy depositions of the e + e \u2212 pair background in the forward detectors [15]. Via the shape of the photon energy spectrum, p-and s-wave production can be clearly distinguished if positron polarisation is available. Finally the mass of the WIMP can be determined with an accuracy between 0.5% and 3%, depending on the WIMP parameters. These numbers are limited by the knowledge of the shape of the beam energy spectrum.",

            "text": "The photon plus missing energy signature at the International Linear Collider has been investigated in the context of a model-independent characterisation of WIMPs. In view of the substantial Standard Model backgrounds to this signature, the analysis has been performed in full detector simulation and with realistic assumptions on the beam properties and resulting systematic uncertainties. The unpolarised cross-section can be measured with an accuracy between 2 and 5 fb depending on the beam polarisation and the WIMP scenario. The helicity structure of the WIMP-fermion interaction can be obtained from the polarised cross-section. These measurements are systematically limited by the knowledge of the beam polarisation.",
