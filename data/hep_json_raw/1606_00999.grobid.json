            "text": "Physics studies fundamental interactions and their effects. At the most basic level, particle physics aims to describe the fundamental blocks of matter and their interactions. A century of research has led to the Standard Model of Particle Physics. It relies on firm theoretical grounds unifying quantum mechanics, special relativity and field theory, and is successful at describing all phenomena measured in particle interactions, whether at low or very high energies. Yet, it has an empirical character with many parameters that need to be determined by experiment, and it is incomplete as it does not account for gravity, does not explain the baryon asymmetry in the Universe and does not provide a candidate for dark matter. The Standard Model is therefore believed to be an approximation of a more complete theory that is currently unknown (just like Newton's laws are an approximation of General Relativity). The primary goal of research in particle physics is to find this more complete theory. In the following \"New Physics\" is used as a catch-all for any contribution -usually associated with a new particle -not included in the Standard Model.",

This article focuses on rare decays of hadrons containing b quarks. The most prevalently produced b hadrons are the B 0 meson composed of a b anti-quark and a d quark, the B + (bu) and B 0 s (bs) mesons, as well as the \u039b 0 b (bud) baryon. Their masses are in the range 5 to 6 GeV/c 2 , which is about six times that of the proton, but well below the mass of the W boson of 80 GeV/c 2 . The corresponding antiparticles B 0 , B \u2212 , B 0 s and \u039b 0 b are obtained by replacing all quarks by anti-quarks and vice-versa. The study of CP violation involves investigation of differences in the behaviour of particles and antiparticles, and is the subject of a dedicated review in Ref. [2].

            "text": "Hadrons with b quarks decay most of the time via a b \u2192 cW * \u2212 transition, where the asterisk indicates the W boson is virtual. The transitions b \u2192 uW * \u2212 also occur, but are less likely. These two transitions are called \"tree decays\" as the process involves a single mediator, the W \u2212 boson. An example of a tree d \u2192 uW * \u2212 transition is shown in Fig. 1.  Fundamental particle interactions are mediated by force carriers: The photon for the electromagnetic interaction, the gluon for the strong interaction and the W \u00b1 and Z bosons for the weak interaction. In the nuclear beta decay a neutron decays to a proton, an electron and a neutrino ( Fig. 1). This weak interaction is mediated by a virtual W \u2212 boson, sometimes denoted W * \u2212 . Here virtual means that the process violates energy and momentum conservation for a very short time, as allowed by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The mass of the W \u2212 boson is about 80 GeV/c 2 , while the neutron-proton mass difference is considerably less: 1.3 MeV/c 2 . It is said that the W \u2212 boson is \"off-shell\". Processes like the rare decay B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 proceed via loops, as shown in Fig. 2 (sometimes referred to as penguins, a word coined by John Ellis [3,4]). Such processes are rare as the probability of a transition rapidly decreases with the number of electroweak vertices: two in the case of a tree decay, three or four for a loop. Also, the heavier the virtual particles involved, the more suppressed the decay. In the following, decays with probabilities in the range 10 \u22124 to 10 \u221210 are discussed.",

Its unexpected non-observation allowed the prediction of the then unknown charm quark by Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani (\"GIM mechanism\") in 1970 [5]. The idea of the GIM mechanism is that this decay only occurs via loops, one involving the u quark and the other the c quark (Fig. 3). The amplitudes of the two loops are of opposite sign, causing complete cancellation in the limit of equal up and charm quark masses. The non-observation of this decay could be explained by adding a new particle to the theory, the c quark, which was eventually discovered in 1974 [6,7]. This is an example of an observation of New Physics mediated by a new virtual particle. The K 0",

The operators encompass the information about the Lorentz structure and the Wilson coefficients encode the effects of higher energy scales. In the case of the Standard Model these are the effects of the W , Z bosons and top quarks, which are effectively removed from the theory and incorporated in the coefficients. Any I \u2192 F decay can be described by this effective Hamiltonian, usually with many terms begin irrelevant, with F |O i |I = 0. Thus studying a set of decays will give various constraints on the effective Hamiltonian, permitting global fits to Wilson coefficients. This is briefly discussed in Section 5. This procedure does not simplify the computation of the amplitudes, as the matrix elements F |O i |I contain the most difficult parts of the calculation. It provides however a common language that is not dependent on the considered New Physics model.",

The first limit on the decay B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 was set by the CLEO collaboration in 1985 [37], the start of a long quest during which the sensitivity was improved by six orders of magnitude, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The CLEO and ARGUS experiments were located at e + e \u2212 colliders operating at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance. The same concept was employed and improved by the BaBar and Belle experiments in the first decade of the 21st century. If Cornell was initially able to produce few tens of BB pairs per day, the PEP-II and KEKB accelerators at SLAC and KEK achieved a daily rate of one million BB pairs. In the meantime, experiments at CERN's LEP e + e \u2212 collider [38][39][40][41] and at Fermilab's Tevatron proton-anti-proton collider used higher energy collisions to produce and study all b-hadron species [42,43]. All the above-mentioned experiments have terminated their programme but most still exploit their data set to produce new results. Belle and the associated accelerator complex is has been undergoing a major upgrade and has recently come back as the Belle II experiment [44].",

The high-resolution silicon system exploits the typical b-hadron flight distances of a few millimetres before their decay to select them.

            "text": "This section presents the main recent experimental results and their interpretation. It starts with a more historical section on the decay b \u2192 s\u03b3 which had (and still has) an important role in the development of the field. In the Standard Model the decay b \u2192 s\u03b3 occurs dominantly via a loop involving the top quark and the W boson (Fig. 6). It has played a very important role in flavour physics from the 1980s [47]. At the time it was the dependency of the branching fraction on the then unknown top quark mass that was the driving force behind the theoretical calculations and the experimental searches (the top quark mass affects the value of the C 7 coefficient in Eq. 4). When B 0 -B 0 mixing was (at the time surprisingly) observed in 1987, it became clear that the top quark was very heavy. The top quark was eventually discovered at the Tevatron [48] in 1995 and its mass measured, which determined the Standard Model decay rate of b \u2192 s\u03b3 to be a few 10 \u22124 . The first observation of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 decay actually preceded the top quark observation. In 1993 the CLEO collaboration reported a signal of the exclusive decay B \u2192 K * \u03b3 with a branching fraction of (4.5\u00b11.5\u00b10.9)\u00d710 \u22125 [49]  (Fig. 7), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This opened the quest for the inclusive decay b \u2192 s\u03b3, i.e. the sum of all exclusive contributions. The branching fraction of this decay is more precisely calculable than its individual exclusive components, like B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3, allowing for more precise comparisons of experimental and theoretical results. The experimental challenges are discussed in more detail in Inset 3 In the Standard Model, the left-handed chirality structure of the weak interactions makes the photon emitted in b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays mainly left-handed. It is interesting to also probe righthanded contributions (sensitive to the Wilson coefficient C 7 ), which requires determination of the polarisation of the photon. This is challenging as the helicity (or chirality) of the photon cannot be measured directly in the detector. Several methods have been proposed, none of which provides a strong constraint so far. The first and so far only measurement of a non-zero Many experiments located at e + e \u2212 colliders have performed measurements using different methods. The total rate of any B meson to a photon plus anything (where the photon is not caused by an electromagnetic decay, e.g. \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 or \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) can be measured by a sum of exclusive decay modes [51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58]. A fully inclusive approach is also possible but more challenging [59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66]. Only the photon and properties of the rest of the collision event are used to separate signal and backgrounds, mostly originating from non-B decays. At the B factories they are determined from data taken at centre-of-mass energies below the \u03a5 (4S) resonance mass, decays to \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 which are vetoed and modelled from data, and mis-identified photons which are modelled from simulation. This method has the disadvantage of larger backgrounds, but has the advantage not to rely on any modelling of the composition of the hadronic state. It thus comes with smaller theoretical uncertainties. A typical result for the measured photon energy spectrum in inclusive b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays is shown in Fig. 8. The integral of the spectrum gives the decay rate. The width is related to the momentum of the b quark in the B meson, which can be seen as a two-body system of a b and a light quark, similar to a hydrogen atom. The world-average measured branching fraction for a photon with an energy above 1.6 GeV in the B-meson rest-frame is (3.32 \u00b1 0.15) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [67]. It can be compared with the latest theoretical calculation of (3.36 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [68,69]. The very good agreement of these two values sets very strong constraints on New Physics models, in particular supersymmetry. Although the total branching fraction seems to indicate no discrepancy with the Standard Model prediction, small contributions from New Physics may still occur. The b \u2192 s\u03b3 decay rate is essentially a measurement of the Wilson coefficient C 7 (see Section 2).",

For instance in the decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 with K * 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 , the amplitude of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 may interfere with that of the same decay following B 0 mixing, B 0 \u2192 B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3. But this is only the case if the photons have the same helicities, and so the left-handed component of the B 0 decay will interfere with the right-handed component of the B 0 decay. This process has been studied at the BaBar and Belle experiments [70,71], and the B 0 s counterpart decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 at LHCb [72]. No significant CP asymmetry is observed to date.",

The result was published in Nature [87], which is unusual in high energy physics. The fit to the invariant mass distribution of the two-muon system is shown in Fig. 10. The result of the combination is an observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay and a small excess over the background for B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 .

However, B \u2192 e + e \u2212 and B \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 also exist. According to its Standard Model prediction, the decay B 0 s \u2192 e + e \u2212 is out of reach in the foreseeable future. Due to the low electron mass, it is even more helicity suppressed than B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Moreover the study of final states involving electrons at hadron colliders is difficult due to the lower reconstruction efficiency and the poorer mass resolution (see for instance Fig. 16). When passing through matter, electrons radiate a significant amount of energy by bremsstrahlung. This affects the reconstructed momentum and thus smears all derived quantities, like the invariant mass of the two-electron system. The best limits are currently B(B 0 s \u2192 e + e \u2212 < 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u22129 and B(B 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 < 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 at 90% C.L. [92]. Either limit is obtained assuming the absence of the other mode, as the signals would not be distinguishable due to the poor mass resolution. These limits are fair form the Standard Model, but start to set constraints on models allowing for different couplings to leptons [75], see Sec. 4.5.",

The challenge is on the experimental side. The decay B 0 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd is traditionally labelled as \"B 0 \u2192 invisible\" as there is no way to experimentally determine the number of neutrinos (or if there were any at all). In the Standard Model the branching fraction is vanishing as it is helicity suppressed by a factor (m \u03bd /m B 0 ) 3 . Helicity suppression occurs because of the B 0 meson is spinless, so the two spin-1 /2 neutrinos must have opposite spins. For massless neutrinos this would be impossible as neutrinos are always left-handed and antineutrinos right-handed. Only the minute mass of neutrinos (rarely) allows opposite-spin neutrinos to be emitted.",

The forward-backward asymmetry A FB is defined as the relative difference between the number of positive and negative leptons going along the direction of the B 0 meson in the rest frame of the two-lepton system. This corresponds to an asymmetry in the distribution of the \u03b8 angle. Similarly, the K * 0 polarisation fraction F L depends on the angle \u03b8 K , defined analogously to \u03b8 . Other asymmetries can be constructed from the other angles or combinations of them. The P 5 asymmetry suggested by Ref. [108] is based on the angles \u03b8 K and \u03c6.

Given the hints of lepton-flavour universality violation between muons and electrons, it seems natural to wonder if such an effect can be seen in processes involving the third generation (\u03c4 ) lepton. This has been tested in B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 decays, comparing to the same decay with muons or electrons instead of tau leptons. Unlike the decays described above, the Standard Model contribution to this decay is not suppressed (and does not match the definition of a rare decay). It proceeds via a tree-level b \u2192 cW \u2212 transition, with the W \u2212 decaying to a lepton and a neutrino. The expectation is that the rates for the decays involving electrons, muons and tau leptons differ only due to phase-space effects (plus small effects due to form factors). The ratios of the rates of b \u2192 c\u03c4 \u03bd to b \u2192 c \u03bd ( = \u00b5, e) measured by BaBar [161,162], Belle [163][164][165][166] and LHCb [167][168][169] come out larger than expected, with an average [67] deviating by approximately 3\u03c3 from the Standard Model predictions [170][171][172][173].

Several groups have performed model-independent fits of Wilson coefficients, using most of the experimental results presented above. See Refs. [91,[174][175][176][177][178][179] for a representative subset. The fits differ by the set of experimental results used, the statistical treatment of uncertainties and choices of form factors. Another major difference is the level of trust of computations of quark loops (most notably cc loops) incorporated in the fit. Depending on these choices, the determined tension with the Standard Model ranges from one to several standard deviations.",
