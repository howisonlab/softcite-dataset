Multi-body baryonic decay modes are found to have larger branching fractions than two-body modes, and the baryon-pair invariant mass spectrum peaks near threshold in the case of multi-body decays [17]. This feature was conjectured in Ref. [18]. Further investigations of the Dalitz plot [19] and the angular correlations for events in the threshold region [20] offer better understanding of the underlying dynamics.",

B 0 mesons can decay to D + s \u039bp through the Cabibbo favoured b \u2192 cud process. They can also decay to the charge conjugate final state through the Cabibbo suppressed b \u2192 ucd process, opening a new avenue for future CP asymmetry studies. We report here the first observation of the decay B 0 \u2192 D + s \u039bp using 414 fb \u22121 of data, corresponding to 449 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs, collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [21]. Since the D + s \u039bp final state may get a contribution from the D 0 p \u2192 D + s \u039b final state rescattering, the previously observed B 0 \u2192 D 0 pp decay [5] could be one of the sources for the D + s \u039bp final state. Inclusion of charge conjugate states is implicit throughout this paper.",

An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [22]. Two different inner detector configurations were used. For the first sample of 152 million BB pairs, a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used; for the latter 297 million BB pairs, a 1.5 cm radius beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used [23]. We use a GEANT-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine the efficiency [24].",

The invariant mass distribution for D + s and \u039b and for corresponding B-sideband is represented as well ( Fig. 1  (d)).
