            "text": "While experimentally the reconstruction of charmonia from b-hadron decays allows an efficient control of combinatorial background with respect to charmonium candidates produced in the p p collision vertex via hadroproduction or in the decays of heavier resonances (prompt charmonium), inclusive b-hadron decays to charmonia are theoretically less clean. Since a description of the strong interaction dynamics in b-hadron inclusive decays improves with respect to exclusive decays due to consideration of more final states, and the formation of charmonium proceeds through a shortdistance process, a factorization of a cc pair production and its hadronization in a given charmonium state becomes a reasonable assumption [16]. The relative inclusive production of \u03c7 c states in b-hadron decays provides a clean test of charmonia production models. For example, the colour evaporation model predicts a \u03c7 c2 /\u03c7 c1 production ratio of 5/3 [17], while the perturbative QCD-based computation predicts that the V-A current, which is responsible for the b decays, forbids the \u03c7 c2 and \u03c7 c0 production at leading order. In the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework [18][19][20], the colour-octet contributions have to be included, predicting the rates to be proportional to (2J +1) for the \u03c7 c J states. The NRQCD framework can be applied to both prompt charmonium production and secondary production from b-hadron decays and the comparison between these two production mechanisms can provide a valuable test of this theoretical framework.",

In the Standard Model (SM) the amplitude for the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 is dominated by a loop diagram. Experimental verification of the partial width, polarization amplitudes and triple-product asymmetries of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay probes the QCD contribution to the weak processes described by nonfactorizable penguin diagrams [24,25], and contributions from particles beyond the SM to the penguin loops [26][27][28][29][30]. A three-body B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 decay leads to a final state with six strange quarks. In the SM it is described by the penguin diagram of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay with the creation of an additional ss quark pair. The B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 decay can also receive contributions from an intermediate charmonium state decaying to a \u03c6\u03c6 state. Here we report first evidence for the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 decay and study its resonance structure. The branching fraction of this decay is determined relative to the branching fraction B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) [22]. To cross-check the technique exploited in this paper, the value of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) is also determined relative to the \u03b7 c (1S) production rate. Finally, the ratio of the branching fractions for the decays \u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and \u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 p p is determined, using additional external information.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum 2 to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillatingpad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The 2D fit accounts for the signal, \u03c6\u03c6, and background, \u03c6 (K + K \u2212 ) and 2(K + K \u2212 ), components, while the 3D fit accounts for the signal, \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6, and background, \u03c6\u03c6 (K + K \u2212 ), \u03c6 2(K + K \u2212 ) and 3(K + K \u2212 ), components. A \u03c6 signal is described by the convolution of a Breit-Wigner function and a sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean. The ratio of the two Gaussian widths and the fraction of the narrower Gaussian are taken from simulation. The contribution from combinatorial background, due to K + K \u2212 pairs not originating from the decay of a \u03c6 meson, is assumed to be flat. In addition, a threshold function to account for the available phase-space in the K + K \u2212 system is introduced for both signal and combinatorial background. While no visible contribution from the f 0 (980) resonance decaying into a K + K \u2212 pair is observed in the 2(K + K \u2212 ) or 3(K + K \u2212 ) combinations, a potential effect due to contributions from such decays is considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. Figures 1 and 2 show the results of the 2D fits to the 2(K + K \u2212 ) invariant mass distributions along with the projections to the K + K \u2212 invariant mass axes in the \u03b7 c (1S) and B 0 s signal regions, 2.91 \u2212 3.06 GeV and 5.30 \u2212 5.43 GeV.

While using the known value for the natural width of the \u03c6 resonance [14], the \u03c6 mass and the remaining resolution parameter are determined from the fits in the enlarged signal \u03c6\u03c6 and \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 invariant mass regions. In the 2D and 3D fits in the bins of \u03c6\u03c6 and \u03c6\u03c6\u03c6 invariant mass the \u03c6 mass and the resolution parameter are then fixed to the values determined in the enlarged signal regions.",

The charmonium-like states X (3872), X (3915) and \u03c7 c2 (2P) with masses and natural widths from Ref. [14] are taken into account in alternative fits in order to evaluate systematic uncertainties, as well as to obtain upper limits on the inclusive production of these states in b-hadron decays. Each resonance is described by the convolution of a relativistic Breit-Wigner function and a sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean. The combinatorial background, i.e. contributions due to random combinations of two true \u03c6 mesons, is described by the product of a first-order polynomial with an exponential function and a threshold factor. The natural width of the \u03b7 c (1S) state is a free parameter in the fit, while the natural widths of the \u03b7 c (2S) and the \u03c7 c states, which have lower signal yields, are fixed to their known values [14]. Possible variations of the \u03b7 c (2S) production rate depending on its natural width, \u03b7 c (2S) , are explored by providing the result as a function of the assumed natural width. The ratio of the two Gaussian widths and the fraction of the narrow Gaussian are fixed from the simulation. The mass resolution for different charmonium resonances is scaled according to the energy release, so that a single free parameter in the \u03c6\u03c6 invariant mass fit accounts for the detector resolution. This scaling of the mass resolution for different charmonium states has been validated using simulation. The signal yields are given in Table 1. The ratios of the resonance yields from the fit are given in Table 2, both for the Table 2 The ratio of charmonium signal yields with respect to the \u03b7 c (1S) yield and between pairs of \u03c7 c states.

The statistical significance for the N \u03b7 c (2S) signal is estimated from the \u03c7 2 -profile to be 3.7 standard deviations. Systematic uncertainties in the ratios of the charmonium yields are estimated by considering potential contributions from other states, from imperfect modelling of detector resolution, signal resonances and background, and from the 2D fit technique. In order to evaluate the systematic uncertainty related to potential contributions from other states, signal shapes for the X (3872), X (3915), and \u03c7 c2 (2P) states are included in the fit. Systematic uncertainties related to detector resolution are estimated by fixing the \u03b7 c (1S) mass resolution to the value determined from the simulation. In addition, systematic uncertainties associated to the impact of the detector resolution on the signal shapes are estimated by comparing the nominal fit results to those obtained using a single instead of a double Gaussian function. An uncertainty associated with the description of the mass resolution of the \u03c6 meson is estimated by fixing the resolution in the 2D fits to the value determined from simulation. The uncertainty associated with the description using the relativistic Breit-Wigner line shape [42] is estimated by varying the radial parameter of the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factor [43] between 0.5 and 3 GeV \u22121 . In order to estimate the uncertainty related to the natural width of the \u03b7 c (2S) meson, the value of \u03b7 c (2S) is varied within the uncertainties of the world average [14]. The uncertainty in the description of the \u03c7 c signal peaks is estimated by fixing the \u03c7 c masses to their known values. A reduced fit range, covering only the \u03c7 c and \u03b7 c (2S) region (3.15\u22123.95 GeV), is used to estimate a systematic uncertainty associated to the choice of the fit range. An alternative background parametrization using a parabolic instead of a linear function is used to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of the background parametrization. A systematic uncertainty associated to the background parametrization in the 2D fits is estimated by adding slope parameters to the description of the non-\u03c6 K + K \u2212 combinations in the \u03c6K + K \u2212 and the 2 \u00d7 (K + K \u2212 ) components. The effect of a potential contribution from the f 0 (980) state in the 2D fits is estimated by including the f 0 (980) contribution following the analysis described in Ref. [44], and varying the f 0 (980) mass and natural width within the uncertainties quoted in Ref. [14]. Contributions from multiple candidates are below 2% per event and are not considered in the evaluation of systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty related to the momentum-scale calibration is negligible. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained as the quadratic sum of the individual systematic contributions. The systematic uncertainties are shown in Table 3. The description of the background and the potential contributions from other resonances dominate the total systematic uncertainties. In the yield ratios the systematic uncertainty is smaller than or comparable to the statistical uncertainty.",

No indirect contribution to the production rate is subtracted. However, since contributions from \u03c8(2S) decays to the \u03c7 c states are limited, the results disfavour dominance of either colour-octet or colour-singlet contributions. The observed relations between the \u03c7 c branching fractions are not consistent with those predicted in Ref. [18]. The branching fraction B(b \u2192 \u03c7 c0 X ) is measured for the first time. The result for b-hadron decays into \u03c7 c1 is the most precise measurement for the mixture of B 0 , B + , B 0 s , B + c and b-baryons. The central value of the result for b-hadron decays into \u03c7 c1 is lower than the central values measured by the DELPHI [8] and L3 [9] experiments at LEP.

The branching fraction of b-hadron decays into \u03c7 c2 is measured for the first time with the B 0 , B + , B 0 s and b-baryons mixture.

The \u03b7 c (1S) inclusive production rate in b-hadron decays was measured by LHCb as B(b \u2192 \u03b7 c (1S)X ) = (4.88 \u00b1 0.97) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [15] using decays to p p. Branching fractions of the charmonia decays to \u03c6\u03c6 from Ref.[14]  are used. However, Ref.[14]  indicates a possible discrepancy for the B(\u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) value when comparing a direct determination and a fit including all available measurements. Therefore, an average of the results from Belle[46] and BaBar[47] using B + decays to \u03c6\u03c6K + , B(\u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (3.21 \u00b1 0.72) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , is used below. The uncertainty of this average dominates the majority of the following results in this section, and an improved knowledge of the B(\u03b7 c (1S) \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) is critical to reduce the uncertainties of the derived results. The values B(\u03c7 c0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (7.7 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , B(\u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (4.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and B(\u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (1.12 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , are used for the \u03c7 c decays[14]. The relative branching fractions of b-hadron inclusive decays into \u03c7 c states are then derived to be",
