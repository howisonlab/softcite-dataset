We review the results for observations of the Z c (3900) and Z c (4020) states, the X(3872) in e + e \u2212 annihilation, and charmonium \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) state, as well as measurements of the cross-sections of \u03c9\u03c7 cJ and \u03b7J/\u03c8, and the search for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ and \u03b3Y (4140). We also present data from BESIII that may further strengthen the study of the XYZ and conventional charmonium states, and discuss perspectives on future experiments.",

The energy-dependent cross-sections were fitted with a Y (4260) resonance (parameters fixed to PDG [12] values), linear continuum, or E1-transition phase space (\u221d E 3 \u03b3 ) term. Figure 5(b) shows all the fitted results, which imply that \u03c7 2 /ndf = 0.49/3 (C.L. = 92%), 5.5/2 (C.L. = 6%), and 8.7/3 (C.L. = 3%) for a Y (4260) resonance, linear continuum, and phase space distribution, respectively. Thus, the Y (4260) resonance describes the data better than the other two options.",

The Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) process could be another previously unseen decay mode of the Y (4260) resonance. Together with the transitions to the charged charmonium- like state Z c (3900) [5,8,9], this suggests that there might be some commonality in the nature of X(3872), Y (4260), and Z c (3900), and so the model developed to interpret any one of them should also consider the other two. As an example, the authors of Ref. [20] integrated these states into a molecular picture to calculate e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) cross-sections.",

No evidence for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c0 was observed. The corresponding Born cross-sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ at different c.m. energies were calculated.

These upper limits on the Born cross-section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ are compatible with the theoretical prediction from the NRQCD calculation [19]. These upper limits can be compared with the X(3872) production rates [18], which were measured from the same data samples (see The branching fraction B(Y (4140) \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8) has not previously been measured. Using the partial width of Y (4140) \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8 calculated under the molecule hypothesis [36] and the total width of the Y (4140) measured by CDF [37], the branching fraction was estimated to be approximately 30%. A rough estimation for B(X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) is 5% [21]  [38], and the Born cross-sections were measured to be (55.4\u00b16.0\u00b15.9) and (23.7 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b1 3.5) pb, respectively.

Statistically significant \u03b7 signals were observed, and the corresponding Born cross-sections were measured. In addition, a search for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 process observed no significant signals, and upper limits at the 90% C.L. on the Born cross-section were set. A comparison of the Born cross-sections \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8) in this measurement to previous results [13,44] is shown in Fig. 9(a), indicating very good agreement. The measured Born cross-sections were also compared to those of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 obtained from the Belle experiment [8], as shown in Fig. 9(b). Different line shapes can be observed in these two processes, indicating that the production mechanism of \u03b7J/\u03c8 differs from that of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 in the vicinity of \u221a s = 4.1-4.6 GeV. This could indicate the existence of a rich spectrum of the Y states in this energy region with different coupling strengths to various decay modes.",

These data samples can be used to study the XYZ and charmonium states in many different ways [1], among which ISR can produce events in the same energy range covered by BESIII. Figure 10 shows the effective luminosity at BEPCII energy in the Belle-II data samples. We can see that, for 10 ab \u22121 Belle-II data, we have about 400-500 pb \u22121 data for every 10 MeV in the range 4-5 GeV, comparable to the data sample proposed at BESIII in the previous section. Of course, the ISR analyses have a lower efficiency than in direct e + e \u2212 collisions because of the extra ISR photons and the boost given to events along the beam direction. Even taking these effects into account, the full Belle-II data sample, which corresponds to about 2000-2300 pb \u22121 data for every 10 MeV from 4-5 GeV, will result in similar statistics for modes like e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. Belle-II has the advantage that data at different energies will be accumulated at the same time, making the analysis much simpler than at BESIII at 60 data points. In addition, Belle-II can produce events above 4.6 GeV, which is currently the maximum energy of BEPCII. Possible upgrades to increase the maximum c.m. energy of BEPCII will obviously expand the physical possibilities of BESIII.",

Although there are no clear structures in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system, there is clear evidence for an exotic charmonium-like structure in the \u03c0 \u00b1 h c system, as clearly shown in the Dalitz plot.",
