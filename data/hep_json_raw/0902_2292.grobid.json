By now, our understanding of many small Q 2 and low x phenomena in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) is limited by experimental systematics and theoretical uncertainties, rather than by statistical precision. However, particularly for searches for new particles and for the understanding of electroweak effects, the principle limitation is often the available integrated luminosity.",

Integrated luminosities of 1 fb \u22121 at low Q 2 and 10 fb \u22121 at high Q 2 are assumed (see section 2), leading to uncertainties at the 1 \u2212 3% level over much of the kinematic plane after a single year of data taking. The resulting cross sections have been used as input to an NLO DGLAP [ 17] QCD fit, similar to those used by the HERA collaborations, in order to estimate the obtainable LHeC precision on the parton distributions. LHeC data could separately constrain all of the quark flavours for the first time in a single experiment. The large luminosities would give a much improved xF 3 measurement compared with HERA, and the valence densities could hence be extracted precisely. With copious charged current data for both e + p and e \u2212 p collisions, up and down quark distributions could be separated. With state-of-the-art secondary vertex detection and a small beam-spot (35 \u00d7 15 \u00b5m 2 has been assumed), heavy flavour quarks could be identified, leading to measurements of the charm and beauty structure functions F cc 2 and F bb 2 to a few percent over a wide kinematic range [ 8,19]. With high luminosity the s ands densities could be measured to unrivalled precision by tagging charm quarks in charged current scattering (W s \u2192 c), potentially casting new light on a possible s \u2212s asymmetry [ 20]. The enhanced sensitivity to \u2202F 2 /\u2202 ln Q 2 due to the larger lever-arm in Q 2 throughout the x range translates directly into a new level of precision on the gluon density. In the process of fitting QCD evolution equations to LHeC data, the strong coupling constant could be measured to an unprecedented experimental precision of a few per mille [ 21].",

However, as x grows at fixed Q 2 , the hadronic final state becomes increasingly strongly boosted in the outgoing proton direction and its measurement becomes increasingly difficult. At the largest x values, the resolution obtained from the scattered electron 4-vector alone degrades severely, 2 such that some control over the very forward-going hadrons is highly desirable.

Parton density predictions over much of the kinematic range relevant to the LHC rely on the assumption that the DGLAP approximation to QCD evolution may be used to evolve partons from the relatively low Q 2 domain of HERA and fixed target DIS experiments to the larger scales of the LHC. DGLAP must, however, become invalid at some low value of x, where ln 1/x terms in the evolution become important [ 22,23] and where resummation approaches may be required [ 24]. Although no evidence of deviations from DGLAP evolution has been obtained from fits to inclusive HERA data, there have been hints from hadronic final state observables such as forward jets [ 25] and azimuthal jet decorrelations [ 26], which are sensitive to the transverse momentum ordering patterns in the parton cascade. It is possible that more will be learned from fitting inclusive LHeC data, though direct observation of the final state parton cascade will remain necessary for a complete picture, requiring hadronic final state acceptance at very small angles to the beampipe [ 27].",

The typical conclusion [ 32] is that HERA data in the perturbative regime do not exhibit any evidence for saturation. However, when data in the Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 region are included, only models which include saturation effects are successful. Whether or not this low Q 2 HERA saturation effect is confirmed, it is desirable to fully understand the mechanisms behind saturation in terms of parton dynamics, which may be possible by studying the very low x region at somewhat larger Q 2 at the LHeC. Figure 6 shows extrapolations of dipole models constrained by fits to HERA data to predict the structure function F 2 (x, Q 2 ) in the LHeC kinematic range. The various predictions are shown as pseudo-data points corresponding to the simulated neutral current LHeC measurement (section 3.2). At the lowest x and Q 2 , there is a clear distinction between the 'FS04-Regge' model [ 32], which does not include saturation effects, and all others [ 32,33], which include saturation as estimated from low Q 2 HERA data.

Given that the beam optics for outgoing protons at the LHeC would not be very different from those at the LHC, first considerations [ 43] suggest that that the region around 420 m from the interaction point would be a suitable place to install a beamline proton spectrometer, similar to that under consideration by ATLAS and CMS [ 44].

This corresponds to a factor of around 6 for the lead ions which will be used at the LHC, leading to gluon densities close to estimates of the black body limit (section 3.3). If a really clear signature for parton saturation exists, for example a dramatic flattening of the x dependence of the F 2 structure function at low x or anomalously strong scaling violations, it is likely to be established first in eA collisions, or through comparisons of eA with ep data. Experimentally, scattering leptons from the LHC heavy ion beams at large Q 2 is expected to lead to final states which do not look dramatically different from ep scattering. However, unlike for the ep case, colliding beam configurations have never previously been employed for eA collisions. Our current knowledge of nuclear parton distributions is thus restricted to the phase space covered by fixed target experiments as shown in figure 8. For example, the NMC data in the DIS region barely extend below x = 10 \u22122 and are restricted to relatively light nuclei (helium, carbon and calcium) [ 45]. The LHeC would extend the known range by up to four orders of magnitude, offering for the first time a quantitative understanding of the (presumably saturated) initial state partons entering the heavy ion collisions which are expected to produce quark gluon plasma conditions at the LHC. Figure 8 also shows the extrapolation of the critical saturation line at central impact parameter, estimated from dipole model fits to low Q 2 HERA data (section 3.3). With sufficient acceptance at low polar angles, the LHeC data falls well beyond this line, whilst remaining in the perturbative region.  Figure 8.

The most promising locations for the interaction point are on the sites of the current ALICE and LHCb experiments, after they have completed their programmes. The principle limitation on the achievable electron energies and luminosities is power consumption, which is large for electron accelerators due to synchrotron radiation losses. A working limit of 100 MW wall-plug power is assumed.",

An electron beampipe in the same tunnel as the LHC has the advantage of high expected luminosity [ 3,51,52], though the achievable electron beam energy is limited by the synchrotron power, which grows as E 4 e . For acceptable power consumption, a luminosity of around 3 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 might be achievable at E e = 50 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb \u2212 1 per year. A 70 GeV electron beam would yield a factor of around four less. Synchronous ep and pp LHC operation appears to be possible, with by-pass tunnels around existing experiments of length a few hundred metres [ 53] also housing around 100 cavities and klystrons comprising the electron beam RF infrastructure [ 54]. The tunnels could be excavated in parallel with LHC pp operation. A finite crossing angle is required in order to ensure that the outgoing electron beam does not 'parasitically' interfere with the proton bunch arriving for the next bunch crossing. It may be possible to avoid significant resultant luminosity losses by using crab cavities [ 55].",

The final focus could be further from the interaction point than for the case of an electron ring, improving low angle detector acceptance. In scenarios sketched to date [ 57,58] which have acceptable power consumption, the linac option leads to lower luminosity than for an electron ring, which has led to proposals to exploit energy recovery techniques.

The highest projected luminosities are achieved by placing beam focusing magnets close to the interaction point. On the other hand, there are a number of reasons (section 3) why hermetic instrumentation for electron and hadronic final state detection is a highly desirable feature of a DIS detector. A number of novel solutions to the compromise between acceptance and luminosity have been proposed, including a 2 stage approach, similar to HERA-I and HERA-II, and the possibility of having two interaction points, focused respectively on high Q 2 and low x physics. More exotic possibilities involve integrating the electron beam focusing and deflecting magnets into the detector design. An example is to instrument the superconducting focusing magnets to give a calorimetric response [ 60] by exploiting scintillation light in the liquid helium of the cryogenics produced by charged particle components of showers.",

Central tracking and vertexing devices might be based on various pixel technologies, whilst CALICE-type solutions and liquid argon sampling are under consideration for electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry, respectively.

Measuring such tracks therefore requires a long tracking detector, as illustrated for example in figure 9a. In the example modular design depicted, there are movable calorimeter inserts, which sit behind the tracking region in the low x configuration and move closer to the interaction region when beam focusing magnets and a shorter tracking region are introduced (figure 9b).
