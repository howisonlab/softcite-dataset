            "text": "Abstract We present a search for a neutrino signal from dark matter self-annihilations in the Milky Way using the Ice-Cube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube). In 1005 days of data we found no significant excess of neutrinos over the background of neutrinos produced in atmospheric air showers from cosmic ray interactions. We derive upper limits on the velocity averaged product of the dark matter self-annihilation cross section and the relative velocity of the dark matter particles \u03c3 A v . Upper limits are set for dark matter particle candidate masses ranging from 10 GeV up to 1 TeV while considering annihilation through multiple channels. This work sets the most stringent limit on a neutrino signal from dark matter with mass between 10 and 100 GeV, with a limit of 1.18 \u2022 10 \u221223 cm 3 s \u22121 for 100 GeV dark matter particles selfannihilating via \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 to neutrinos (assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo profile).",

            "text": "With the increasingly strong indications of the existence of extended halos of dark matter surrounding galaxies and galaxy clusters [1], there is much interest within the particle physics community to determine the nature and properties of dark matter [2]. The frequently considered hypothesis is that dark matter consists of stable massive particles interacting feebly with Standard Model particles. The density of dark matter particles today is determined by the 'freeze-out' [3][4][5][6] in the early universe when the thermal equilibrium can no longer be sustained as the universe expands and cools down. This work focuses on a generic candidate particle for dark matter referred to as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) [7][8][9][10], though this search is sensitive to any self-annihilating dark matter particle with a coupling to the Standard Model resulting in a flux of neutrinos. The source considered is the Milky Way galaxy, which is embedded in a spherical halo of dark matter [11][12][13][14][15]. For a given halo density profile, the total amount of dark matter in the line of sight from Earth can be determined [16].",

The cut is asymmetric because the atmospheric muon background is increasingly larger towards a zenith of zero (i.e. the southern celestial pole). A containment cut is used to keep only events that have a reconstructed interaction vertex within a cylinder with a radius corresponding to the analysis volume depicted on Fig. 1. In addition cuts are applied on track quality [31]. By considering the hits in the veto volume that are cleaned away (as possible noise), clusters are determined for hits that are within 250 m and 1000 ns from each other and are registered earlier than the first quantile of cleaned hits. These clusters are required to have fewer than three hits, as larger clusters are generally observed more often for penetrating atmospheric muons.",

            "text": "This analysis demonstrates the continued improvements in dark matter searches with neutrinos, providing a valuable complement to the bounds from Cherenkov telescopes and gamma-ray satellites. A more inclusive event selection and the use of an improved event reconstruction algorithm have increased the sensitivity of IceCube to the signal of dark matter self-annihilation. However, no significant excess above the expected background has been observed in 3 years of Icecube/DeepCore data. Upper limits have been put on \u03c3 A v providing the leading limits on WIMPs with a mass between 10 and 100 GeV for a neutrino observatory.",
