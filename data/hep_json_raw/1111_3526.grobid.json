            "text": "Scaled momentum distributions for the strange hadrons K 0 S and \u039b/\u039b were measured in deep inelastic ep scattering with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 330 pb \u22121 . The evolution of these distributions with the photon virtuality, Q 2 , was studied in the kinematic region 10 < Q 2 < 40000 GeV 2 and 0.001 < x < 0.75, where x is the Bjorken scaling variable. Clear scaling violations are observed. Predictions based on different approaches to fragmentation were compared to the measurements. Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo calculations interfaced to the Lund string fragmentation model describe the data reasonably well in the whole range measured. Nextto-leading-order QCD calculations based on fragmentation functions, FFs, extracted from e + e \u2212 data alone, fail to describe the measurements. The calculations based on FFs extracted from a global analysis including e + e \u2212 , ep and pp data give an improved description. The measurements presented in this paper have the potential to further constrain the FFs of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons yielding K 0 S and \u039b/\u039b strange hadrons.",

            "text": "The jet fragmentation and hadronisation processes through which coloured partons become bound in colour-neutral hadrons cannot be described within the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD). Several approaches have been developed which attempt to build a bridge between the fixed-order partonic cross sections and the observed hadrons. Two of the most successful and widely used approaches are the Lund string model [1] and the fragmentation functions (FFs) [2][3][4][5][6]. The Lund string model, relying on a large number of parameters, is interfaced to leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo models. The FFs are parameterisations of the hadronisation process within the standard framework of leading-twist collinear QCD factorisation, in a similar way to that of the parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are convoluted with the predicted partonic cross sections.",

The Breit frame [42,43] is the frame in which the exchanged virtual boson is purely space-like, with 3-momentum q = (0, 0, \u2212Q), providing a maximal separation between the products of the beam fragmentation and the hard interaction. The measurements were performed in the current region of the Breit frame, which is equivalent to one hemisphere in e + e \u2212 annihilations, as functions of Q 2 and x p . Next-to-leading-order predictions, based on different FFs, and leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo calculations, interfaced with the Lund string fragmentation model, were compared to the measurements.",

The prediction for this region of phase space is mainly constrained by pp data, which sufficiently constrain the FFs at high x p . At lower x p , the DSS calculations fail to describe the data. This can be explained by the fact that the DSS fit in this region of phase space is mostly unconstrained JHEP03(2012)020 by the available data. Thus, the measurements presented in this paper will help to improve significantly such global fits in this region of phase space. Figure 5 and table 2 show the scaled momentum distributions for K 0 S as functions of x p in two regions of Q 2 . The predictions of CDM and MEPS give a good description of the data. In both regions of Q 2 , both NLO calculations predict too-steep spectra. At low Q 2 , this effect is especially pronounced. Figures 6 and 7 show the scaled momentum distributions for \u039b. The results are also presented in tables 3 and 4. Scaling violations are clearly observed. The predictions of JHEP03(2012)020 CDM and MEPS give a reasonable description of the measurements, but overestimate the overall \u039b rate by \u2248 20%. The AKK+Cyclops NLO calculations fail to describe the measurements. As seen in figure 7, the predicted spectra in x p are, as in the case of K 0 S , significantly too steep. ZEUS has previously published measurements of scaled momentum distributions for inclusive charged particles in DIS [28]. These measurements are dominated by the contribution from charged pions. Figure 8 shows the scaled momentum distributions presented in this paper together with those from the inclusive charged particles analysis in the kinematic region of 0.1 < x p < 0.4 as functions of Q 2 . For Q 2 > 100 GeV 2 , all distributions show a plateau. At lower Q 2 , and especially at low x p , sizeable mass effects are expected. This is clearly visible. For 0.1 < x p < 0.2, the value of (1/N )(n(H)/\u2206x p ) drops to 10 (20)% of its maximum value for \u039b (K 0 S ), while for inclusive charged particles, the (1/N )(n(H)/\u2206x p ) value is still 40% of the plateau value at the lowest Q 2 accessible.

            "text": "Scaled momentum distributions for K 0 S and \u039b hadrons were measured for the first time in ep DIS. The distributions were measured in the Q 2 range from 10 to 40000 GeV 2 and 0.001 < x < 0.75. Scaling violations were clearly observed for both the K 0 S and \u039b hadrons. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations, based on different parameterisations of the FFs, were compared to the measurements. The predictions based on FFs extracted from e + e \u2212 data alone fail to describe the measurements. Those predictions based on a global analysis which include e + e \u2212 , pp and ep data give an improved description of the measurements. However, they predict a too high production rate of K 0 S and \u039b hadrons at low x p and Q 2 . The measurements presented in this paper have the potential to constrain significantly the FFs for the strange hadrons K 0 S and \u039b.     Open Access.

The description of the data by the Monte Carlo simulation is adequate.Figure 3 shows the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and M (p\u03c0) distributions after these requirements. A small amount of background is observed. The fit shown in figure 3 is for illustration only. The number of K 0 S (\u039b) candidates in each bin of x p and Q 2 was estimated by counting the entries in the signal region, 472 \u2212 522 (1107.0 \u2212 1124.5) MeV, and subtracting the number of expected background entries. The latter was determined from a linear fit to the sideband regions 403 \u2212 422 and 572 \u2212 597 (1086.0 \u2212 1098.2 and 1133.2 \u2212 1144.4) MeV, also indicated in figure 3. There were 806 505 (165 875) K 0S (\u039b) candidates in the data sample. In the current region of the Breit frame, there were 238 153 K 0 S and 40 728 \u039b candidates. A Monte Carlo study showed that 6% of the selected \u039b candidates come from higher-baryon decays.",
