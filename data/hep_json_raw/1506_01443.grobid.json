The analysis is performed on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Signal events, in which the decay products of Higgs, W, or Z bosons at high Lorentz boost are contained within single reconstructed jets, are identified using jet substructure techniques, including the tagging of b hadrons. This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying into HW or HZ resulting in an all-jet final state, as well as the first application of jet substructure techniques to identify H \u2192 WW * \u2192 4q decays at high Lorentz boost. No significant signal is observed and limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross sections of W and Z in a model with mass-degenerate charged and neutral spin-1 resonances.",

            "text": "The composite Higgs [1][2][3] and little Higgs models [4][5][6] address the hierarchy problem and predict many new particles, including additional gauge bosons, e.g. heavy spin-1 W or Z bosons (V ). These models can be generalized in the heavy vector triplet (HVT) framework [7]. Of particular interest for this search is the HVT scenario B model, where the branching fractions B(W \u2192 WH) and B(Z \u2192 ZH) dominate over the corresponding branching fractions to fermions, and are comparable to B(W \u2192 WZ) and B(Z \u2192 WW). In this scenario, experimental constraints from searches for boson decay channels are more stringent than those from fermion decay channels. Several searches [8][9][10][11][12] for W \u2192 WZ based upon the Extended Gauge Boson (EGB) reference model [13] have excluded resonance masses below 1.7 TeV. Unlike the HVT scenario B model, the EGB model has enhanced fermionic couplings and the mass limit is not directly comparable to this work. Model independent limits on the cross section for the resonant production \u03bd + jets [14] can be used to extract resonance mass limits on the processes W \u2192 WZ and Z \u2192 WW of -1 -JHEP02(2016)145 1.7 TeV and 1.1 TeV, respectively. A search for Z \u2192 ZH \u2192 qq\u03c4 \u03c4 was reported in ref. [15] and interpreted in the context of HVT scenario model B; however, no resonance mass limit could be set with the sensitivity achieved. Finally, a recent search [16] combining leptonic decays of W and Z bosons, and two b-tagged jets forming a H \u2192 bb candidate excluded HVT model A with coupling constant g V = 1 for heavy vector boson masses below m V 0 < 1360 GeV and m V \u00b1 < 1470 GeV.",

The signal is characterized by a peak in the dijet invariant mass (m jj ) distribution over a continuous background from mainly QCD multijet events. The sensitivity to b-quark jets from H decays is enhanced through subjet or jet b tagging [22].

The bulk of the V or H jet mass arises from the kinematics of the two or more jet cores that correspond to the decay quarks. In contrast, the QCD jet mass arises mostly from soft gluon radiation. For this reason, the use of jet pruning [47,48]   Figure 1. The fraction of simulated signal events for hadronically decaying W/Z and H bosons, reconstructed as two jets, that pass the geometrical acceptance criteria (|\u03b7| < 2.5, |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.3), shown as a function of the resonance mass. by removing the softer radiation, as this shifts the jet mass of QCD jets to smaller values, while maintaining the jet mass for V and H jets close to the masses of W, Z or H bosons. Jet pruning is implemented by applying additional cuts in the process of CA jet clustering. These cuts remove protojets that would have a large angle and low p T with respect to the combination with another protojet. The details of this procedure are given in ref. [24]. The distributions of the pruned jet mass (m j ) for simulated signal and background samples, are shown in figure 2. Jets from boosted W and Z decays are expected to generate peaks at m j \u2248 80 and m j \u2248 90 GeV, respectively. Jets from boosted H decays are expected to peak at m j \u2248 120 GeV. Hadronic top-quark jets, where the b quark and the two different light quarks from the t \u2192 Wb \u2192 qq b decay are required to be within a reconstructed CA8 jet, peak at m j \u2248 175 GeV. The peak around 20 GeV arises from unmerged light jets, mostly associated with quark-and gluon-induced jets from multijet events, but also from quark jets from W, Z, and H bosons in the cases where the decay products do not end up in a single jet. The contribution from bosons depends on their spin and polarization. All peaks are slightly shifted to lower masses because of the removal of soft radiation in jet pruning. If the pruned jet has a mass (m j ) within 70 < m j < 100 GeV/c 2 (110 < m j < 135 GeV/c 2 ), it is tagged as a W/Z (H) candidate.",

Jets arising from the hadronization of b quarks (b jets) are identified using the \"Combined Secondary Vertex\" b-tagging algorithm [49], which uses information from tracks and secondary vertices associated with jets to build a likelihood-based discriminator to distinguish between jets from b quarks and those from charm or light quarks and gluons. The b-tagging discriminator can take values between 0 and 1 with higher values indicating higher probability for the jet to originate from a b quark. The \"loose\" working point of the b-tagging algorithm [49] is chosen and is found to be optimal for both subjet and jet b tagging. It has a b-tagging efficiency of \u224885%, with mistagging probabilities of \u224840% for c-quark jets and \u224810% for light-quark and gluon jets at jet p T near 80 GeV. The ratio of b-tagging efficiencies for data and simulation is applied as a scale factor [22] to the simulated signal events. To identify CA8 jets originating from H \u2192 bb decays, we apply b tagging either to the two subjets or to the CA8 jet, based on the angular separation of the two subjets (\u2206R) [22]. If \u2206R is larger (smaller) than 0.3, the b-tagging algorithm is applied to both of the subjets (the single CA8 jet).",

We find that \u03c4 21 is the most suitable variable for identifying W/Z \u2192 qq jets [12]. The distribution of \u03c4 21 for the W/Z \u2192 qq signal, shown in figure 3, peaks below 0.4 and is almost fully contained within \u03c4 21 < 0.75, where we place our cut. In contrast, the QCD background peaks around 0.6. The figure shows only W/Z candidate jets with the pruned jet mass in the W/Z boson mass window. For this reason, the jets matched to the top quark are mostly true W bosons, and appear signal-like. However, they represent only a small fraction of the top quarks from tt events (cf. figure 2), since in the kinematic regime considered in this search, the top quarks are highly boosted and the b jet rarely fails to merge with the W jet.

Because of its large branching fraction, H \u2192 bb contributes a non-negligible number of events to the H \u2192 WW * \u2192 4q tagged sample. In order to combine events from H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 WW * \u2192 4q channels into a single joint likelihood, these categories must be mutually exclusive.

The variable n i quantifies the number of observed events in the i th m jj bin. The number of background events N i (B) is described by the functional form of eq. (5.1). The signal shape for each narrow-width resonance hypothesis is obtained by fitting the m jj distribution from simulated events with a sum of a Gaussian and a Crystal Ball probability density function. The resulting shape is fixed and, as such, used in the combined signal and background fit. This procedure is repeated for each resonance hypothesis, sampling resonance masses from 1.0 to 2.6 TeV in steps of 50 GeV. While maximizing the likelihood, \u00b5 and the parameters of the background function are left unconstrained. The shape of the resonance is additionally modified to account for systematic uncertainties (described below); parameters controlling each source of systematic uncertainty are also allowed to vary in the fit, albeit within constraints. For presentational purposes, a binning according to m jj resolution is used in this paper. However, the likelihood is calculated in bins of 1 GeV in m jj , approximating an unbinned analysis, while keeping it computationally manageable. events to zero, while the bottom panels show the corresponding pull distributions, quantifying the agreement between the background-only hypothesis and the data.

            "text": "The asymptotic approximation [62] of the LHC CL s criterion [63,64] is used to set upper limits on the cross section for resonance production. The dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters associated with log-normal priors in those variables. For a given value of the signal cross section, the nuisance parameters are fixed to the values that maximize the likelihood, a method referred to as profiling. The dependence of the likelihood on parameters used to describe the background in eq. 5.1 same manner, and no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned to the parameterization of the background. Events from the 5 categories of table 1 are combined into a common likelihood, with the uncertainties of the HP and LP H tag (V tag) efficiencies considered to be anticorrelated between HP and LP tagging because events failing the HP \u03c4 42 (\u03c4 21 ) selection migrate to the LP category and the fraction of events failing both HP and LP requirements is small compared to the HP and LP events. The branching fractions of H \u2192 WW * \u2192 4q and H \u2192 bb decays are taken as fixed values in joint likelihood. The remaining systematic uncertainties in the signal are fully correlated across all channels. The variables describing the background uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated. Figure 10 shows the observed and background-only expected upper limits on the production cross sections for Z and W , including both H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 WW * \u2192 4q decays, computed at 95% confidence level (CL), with the predicted cross sections for the benchmark models overlaid for comparison. In the HVT model scenario B, W and Z are degenerate in resonance mass, thus we compute the limit on their combined cross section under this hypothesis, shown in figure 11. Table 5 shows the exclusion ranges on resonance masses.",

A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector has been used to measure the W/Z and Higgs boson-tagged dijet mass spectra using the two highest p T jets within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and with pseudorapidity separation |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.3. The QCD background is suppressed using jet substructure tagging techniques, which identify boosted bosons decaying into hadrons. In particular, the mass of pruned jets and the N -subjettiness ratios \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 42 , as well as b tagging applied to the subjets of the Higgs boson jet, are used to discriminate against the otherwise overwhelming QCD background. The remaining QCD background is estimated from a fit to the dijet mass distributions using a smooth function. We have searched for the signal as a peak on top of the smoothly falling QCD background. No significant signal is observed. In the HVT model B, a Z is excluded in resonance mass intervals [1.0, 1.1] and [1.3, 1.5] TeV, while a W is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV. A mass degenerate W plus Z particle is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.",
