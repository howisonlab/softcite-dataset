            "text": "Current data at RHIC demonstrate rapidly thermaliz-7 ing matter characterized by: 1) initial energy densities 8 far above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for 9 formation of a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP); 2) opacity 10 to jets; and 3) nearly perfect fluid flow, which is marked 11 by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, 12 established most probably at a stage preceding hadron 13 formation [1]. One of the important next objectives is to 14 study the color screening length in QGP [2]. Constituent 15 heavy quark-antiquark pairs in quarkonia are subject to 16 color screening and should be dissolved at high temper-17 ature. The dissociation temperatures of different species 18 will vary due to different radii and binding energies. The 19 precise measurements of transverse momentum (p T ) dis-20 tributions of quarkonia for different centralities, collision 21 systems, and energies will serve as a thermometer of the 22 QGP. 23 J/\u03c8 is the most studied quarkonium at the RHIC 24 and LHC. In central collisions, J/\u03c8 is less suppressed 25 in Pb+Pb at 2.76 TeV for 2.5 < |y| < 4 than in Au+Au 26 collisions at 200 GeV for 1.2 < |y| < 2.2 [3, 4]. A similar 27 feature is observed for mid-rapidity comparisons between 28 LHC and RHIC energies. Comparisons to model calcula-29 tions indicate that recombination plays a significant role 30 at RHIC and a more significant role at LHC. Further-31 more, the p T dependence of J/\u03c8 suppression [4-6], the 32 flow pattern of J/\u03c8 as a function of p T [7, 8], and the 33 high p T J/\u03c8 suppression pattern as a function of cen-34 trality [6, 9], reported at LHC and RHIC, can be de-35 scribed consistently by model calculations incorporating 36 color screening and recombination features (See a recent 37 review article for details [10]).",
