            "text": "Production of multiple heavy quark pairs in high-energy hadron collisions was first observed in 1982 by the NA3 collaboration in the channels \u03c0 \u2212 (p) nucleon \u2192 J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 + X [1,2]. Soon after, evidence for the associated production of four open charm particles in pion-nucleon reactions was obtained by the WA75 collaboration [3]. A measurement of J/\u03c8 pair production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [4] has been made by the LHCb collaboration in 2011. This measurement appears to be in good agreement with two models within the single parton scattering (SPS) mechanism, namely non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) calculations [5] and k T -factorization [6]. However the obtained result also agrees with predictions [7] of the double parton scattering (DPS) mechanism [8][9][10][11][12].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [48], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware stage, events for this analysis are selected requiring dimuon candidates with a product of their transverse momenta p T larger than 1.7 (2.6) GeV 2 /c 2 for data collected at \u221a s = 7 (8) TeV. In the subsequent software trigger, two well reconstructed tracks are required to have hits in the muon system, to have p T > 500 MeV/c and p > 6 GeV/c and to form a common vertex. Only events with a dimuon candidate with a mass m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 larger than 4.7 GeV/c 2 are retained for further analysis.",

To suppress combinatorial background the decay time of C hadrons is required to exceed 100 \u00b5m/c. Full decay chain fits are applied separately for selected \u03a5 and C candidates [60]. For \u03a5 mesons it is required that the vertex is compatible with one of the reconstructed pp collision vertices. In the case of long-lived charm hadrons, the momentum direction is required to be consistent with the flight direction calculated from the locations of the primary and secondary vertices. The reduced \u03c7 2 of these fits, both \u03c7 2 fit (\u03a5) /ndf and \u03c7 2 fit (C) /ndf, are required to be less than 5, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit. The requirements favour the selection of charm hadrons produced promptly at the pp collision vertex and significantly suppress the feed down from charm hadrons produced in decays of beauty hadrons. The contamination of such C hadrons in the selected sample varies between (0.4 \u00b1 0.2)% for D + mesons to (1.5 \u00b1 0.5)% for \u039b + c baryons. The selected \u03a5 and C candidates are paired to form \u03a5C candidates. A global fit to the \u03a5C candidates is performed [60], similar to that described above, which requires both hadrons to be consistent with originating from a common vertex. The reduced \u03c7 2 of this fit, \u03c7 2 fit (\u03a5C) /ndf, is required to be less than 5. This reduces the background from the pile-up of two independent pp interactions producing separately a \u03a5 meson and C hadron to a negligible level, keeping 100% of the signal \u03a5 mesons and C hadrons from the same primary vertex. The two-dimensional mass distributions for \u03a5C pairs after the selection are displayed in figure 1. LHCb ",

The signal shapes and parameters are taken from fits to large low-background inclusive \u03a5 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and charm samples. The parameters, signal peak positions and resolutions and the tail parameters for the double-sided Crystal Ball and the modified Novosibirsk functions, are varied within their uncertainties as determined from the calibration samples. The small difference in parameters between the data sets obtained at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV is also used to assign the systematic uncertainty. For D 0 and D + signal peaks alternative fit models have been used, namely a double-sided asymmetric variant of an Apolonious function [78] without power-law tail, a double-sided Crystal Ball function and an asymmetric Student-t shape. The systematic uncertainty related to the parameterization of the combinatorial background is determined by varying the order of the polynomial function in eq. (4.1) between zeroth and second order. For the purely combinatorial background component (last line in eq. (4.2)), a non-factorizable function is used  Figure 11.

The measured crosssections are in agreement with DPS expectations and significantly exceed the expectations from the SPS mechanism.
