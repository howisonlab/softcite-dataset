The decay products of these top quarks are confined to a cone in the top quark flight direction and can be clustered into a single jet. Top quark reconstruction then amounts to analysing the structure of the jet and looking for subjets that are kinematically compatible with top quark decay. Many techniques have been developed in this context to identify top quarks in a large background of non-top jets. This article reviews the results obtained using data recorded in the years 2010-2012 by the experiments ATLAS and CMS. Studies of Standard Model top quark production and searches for new massive particles that decay to top quarks are presented.",

The Tevatron experiments are not sensitive to boosted top quarks as shown by the CDF Collaboration in [4]. The study of boosted topologies has seen an explosion of interest after it had been shown by Butterworth et al. [5] that the boosted signature makes possible the use of hadronic decay channels in searches at the LHC. These channels have often the highest branching ratio but had been deemed infeasible before because of the large background at a hadron-hadron machine. In the years following, many aspects of jet structure have been investigated in the light of the identification of boosted top quarks and boosted W, Z, and Higgs bosons. The crucial point has always been how well the jets that include the decay products of a heavy particle can be distinguished from background jets that originate from hard light quarks or gluons (QCD jets).",

Before these techniques could be used in analyses, a number of basic and technical works had to be carried out. The jets in top quark reconstruction are much larger than the ones used to reconstruct the kinematics of single partons. These large jets (fat 1 Throughout this text, natural units are used with c = 1 =h. jets) first needed to be calibrated and the precision with which simulations can model the jet structure observed in the detector had to be quantified so that comparisons with predictions became meaningful. The quality of predictions of the parton shower and hadronisation needed to be assessed which is especially important in the context of large jets that contain several hard partons, some of which may be connected by colour strings. In addition, the situation is complicated by the presence of overlay signals that result from slow detector read-out and additional particles due to multiple inelastic proton-proton ( pp) interactions. The size of the large jets makes them especially susceptible to this pile-up energy.",

Background samples that are dominated by jets which do not contain top quark decay products are easily obtained and were studied extensively. Samples of events with a top quark and an anti-top quark (tt pair) were obtained through a conventional selection, i.e., without relying on jet structure techniques. These events were used to test the performance of boosted top quark reconstruction methods and to evaluate systematic uncertainties. This made first applications of jet structure techniques in searches for new TeV-scale particles that decay to highly energetic top quarks possible. To this day, these types of analyses feature prominently in the analysis of ATLAS and CMS data.",

One example is the associated production of a Higgs boson with a tt pair [6]. The measurement of the production cross section of this process will allow the extraction of the coupling strength between the Higgs boson and the top quark. This top Yukawa coupling plays an important role for the stability of the vacuum because it drives the Higgs self-coupling toward zero at high scales. If and at which scale vacuum instability occurs depends on the value of the top Yukawa coupling. Only by measuring tt H production can the coupling be determined in a model-independent way without assuming the absence of new particles. In the SM, the coupling is related to the top quark pole mass which has been measured independently and a direct determination of the coupling will therefore test the SM.",

In the laboratory frame, the decay products of such a particle are collimated in the particle flight direction. This poses new experimental challenges compared to decays at rest. The difference between decay at rest and boosted decay is illustrated in Fig. 1. A particle X decays to two jets. If X is at rest, the two jets are well separated and will be detected as two distinct jets. If X is boosted, the two jets are collimated in the forward direction. If the boost of X is large enough, the two jets merge into a large single jet (fat jet). The structure of this fat jet contains information about the decay.",

The subtraction of two finely tuned large variables is unnatural and an impetus to develop new theories. The fact that the level of fine-tuning is already problematic at 10 TeV prompts hopes of finding New Physics at the LHC. Of course, if the cut-off scale is taken to be the Planck scale of 10 19 GeV then the problem is all the worse. The top quark is at the heart of this problem because it contributes the largest mass correction. The corrections due to the other fermions are much smaller because their Yukawa couplings are 1. Different extensions of the SM exist that tackle the finetuning problem. Supersymmetry introduces partner particles which differ by 1/2 in the spin quantum number such that their loop contributions cancel those of the SM particles. Little Higgs models [26] (and references in [25]) generate the Higgs boson as a (pseudo-)Nambu-Goldstone boson of a new approximate global symmetry that is collectively broken. The Higgs boson mass is then protected by this symmetry, to the extend that the divergence at the 1-loop level is only logarithmic and not quadratic as in (3)- (5).",

Expanding the quark condensate about the VEV, three massless quark-antiquark states occur that can be identified with the three pions.

This has inspired EWSB models in which the top quark plays a special role, such as topcolor and topcolor-assisted technicolor [29,30]. The following summary is based on the introduction in [31]. Topcolor is a new force, given by SU (3) 1 \u00d7 SU (3) 2 , in which group 1 couples the first two generations and group 2 the third generation and the coupling in group 2 is much stronger. The breaking of global SU (3) 1 \u00d7 SU (3) 2 to the SM SU (3) C produces eight NGBs, the topgluons, which couple mainly to bb and tt. To remove the degeneracy between top and bottom quarks, a new neutral gauge boson, the topcolor Z , is introduced. It provides an attractive interaction between tt and a repulsive interaction between bb. This is achieved by introducing a new U (1) 1 \u00d7 U (1) 2 symmetry which is broken to the SM U (1) Y . The Z is the gauge boson of the U (1) i . Different Z models can be obtained by changing the assignment of the generations to the two groups [31]. The topcolor Z boson is produced in the s-channel through quark-antiquark annihilation and the decay width is typically = 1.2 % \u00d7 m Z .",

The distributions are compared to those from SM background (PYTHIA): a tt production and b multijet production for which the invariant mass of the leading p T dijets is plotted (|\u03b7 jet | < 0.5 and leading p T > 500 GeV). The events are produced in pp collisions at \u221a s = 14 TeV and the background uncertainties correspond to 100 f b \u22121 . From [40], used with permission are strongly collimated. Each top quark is therefore reconstructed as a single jet. Also shown in Fig. 6a is the background from SM tt production above which the signal clearly stands out. The dominating background is that from QCD dijet production (also referred to as multijet production) in which two partons scatter and produce two high p T outgoing partons. After the QCD shower (gluon radiation and splitting) and fragmentation into hadrons, the final state consists of two or more jets. This background is shown in Fig. 6b and it exceeds the signal by approximately one order of magnitude. To discover the signal, the multijet background has to be suppressed by analysing the internal structure of the jets.",

The underlying event are the particles scattered in interactions that are not related to the hard scatter. These additional interactions are predominantly soft and the energies are small compared to those involved in the hard scatter. Nevertheless, these energies lead to a shift in the reconstructed jet energy compared to the energy of the hard scatter parton. The shift in p T due to the UE is shown in Fig. 8 (upper curves) as a function of the radius parameter R for C/A jets with 55 < p T < 70 GeV at the parton level in gg \u2192 gg scattering at the LHC with \u221a s = 14 TeV.

In this process, new partons emerge between colour-connected partons and the energy is in part re-assigned. If one compares a jet built from the partons with a jet of the same size built from the hadrons, the hadron jet has smaller energy (or p T ) because some of the parton energy is lost in hadrons that are not captured in the jet. This loss is larger when the jet R is smaller as shown in Fig. 8 (lower curves). The p T shift can be calculated analytically [56] and is approximately proportional to 1/R. For R = 1 the shift is \u2248\u22121 GeV for C/A jets. In magnitude this shift is only 20 % of the UE shift which works in the opposite direction. The parameter R that minimises the quadratic sum of the UE and hadronisation corrections is R = 0.41 for quark jets and R = 0.54 for gluon jets [56]. The standard jet sizes in the ATLAS and CMS experiments (R = 0.4 and R = 0.5, respectively) are driven by such optimisations.

The LHC was designed for \u221a s = 14 TeV but operation at higher energies was not possible because cable connections between dipole magnets that were soldered at room temperature can develop high resistivity due to mechanical stress when cooled down to superconducting temperature. This can lead to electric arcs when the current is large. This happened on 19 September 2008 when a magnet quenched and an electric arc developed and punctured the enclosure that held the liquid helium. The helium expanded to the gaseous state and was released into the vacuum that thermally insulates the beam pipe. Upon expansion, the helium volume increased by a factor 1000 and the resulting pressure destroyed several magnets. The LHC had to be shut down for a year for repairs. After the restart, the magnet currents were kept below a safety threshold, thereby limiting the bending power and consequently the beam energy. Safely going to higher collision energies requires the replacement of all soldered connections with clamped splices. This work is ongoing since spring 2013 in the so-called Long Shutdown 1. After the replacement, the LHC is expected to collide protons with \u221a s = 13-14 TeV starting in spring 2015. In 2011 and 2012, the number of protons per bunch was 1.5-1.7 \u00d7 10 11 with 1380 bunches in the machine [60]. The bunch separation was 50 ns. The instantaneous luminosity L reached values of 3.5 \u00d7 10 33 Hz/cm 2 in 2011 and 7.7 \u00d7 10 33 Hz/cm 2 in 2012.",

The remaining entries are then taken to be photons and neutral hadrons. After every step, the detector entries associated with a particular particle type are removed before continuing with the next type. Muons are identified through a global fit of hits in the inner detector and the muon detector. The energy left by muons is 0.5(5) GeV in the ECAL and 3(3) GeV in the HCAL. Electrons are found in a fit that includes emission of Bremsstrahlung photons at layers of the tracking detector and cuts on calorimeter variables. Charged hadrons are identified by comparing the p T of a track with the calibrated energy of the associated cluster (track-cluster link). If the p T and the energy are compatible, a charged hadron is reconstructed using the track p T and the mass of a charged pion. A complication arises when several ECAL clusters are associated to the track. These clusters can correspond to the electromagnetic part of a hadronic shower, in which case they should be included in the charged hadron energy, or to photons. The clusters are ordered in distance from the extrapolated track position and the energy of the closest clusters is added to the track-associated cluster until the p T of the track is reached. If the cluster energy exceeds the track p T then a photon is reconstructed with the energy measured in the ECAL and a neutral hadron with the HCAL energy. The preference is given to photons because they constitute on average 25 % of the jet energy while only 10 % is carried by neutral hadrons and not all of their energy is deposited in the ECAL. The cluster calibration is obtained from simulation and is validated using test-beam data and collision data with isolated charged hadrons [68]. The photon energy is validated using \u03c0 0 decays [68].",

In version 6, the evolution variable in the parton shower can be chosen to be either virtuality (mass) or transverse momentum. In version 8, the evolution is in transverse momentum and dipole showering is possible for the final state. 7 The partons are hadronised using Lund string fragmentation [73]. PYTHIA has a multiple interactions model for the underlying event (UE). The hadronisation and UE model parameters are tuned to minimum bias data. ATLAS tunes are described in [74,75].",

The energy of the ghost is set to 1.001 times its momentum to ensure a positive ghost mass. The ghost tracks are added to the calorimeter jet clustering but do not change the jet because their energy is negligible. If the ghost track ends up in the jet then the original track is taken to be associated with the jet.

The most precise method determines the uncertainty for jets with p T < 300 GeV from tt events [108] and fits the observed b-tag multiplicity. The study is carried out using a semileptonic tt selection and a leptonic selection. The flavour composition before the tag is obtained from simulation. The expected number of b-tags is given by the product of the number of signal and background jets of a par-  [107] ticular flavour with the efficiency to tag this jet. The mis-tag rates are taken from simulation but with data-driven scale factors applied [108]. The efficiency is obtained through a fit to the measured b-tag multiplicity. If one would consider only one data sample then the equation could be solved for the efficiency instead of fitting. However, several channels are considered: e+jets, \u03bc+jets, ee, \u03bc\u03bc, and e\u03bc. The tt production cross section is known to 10 % and the normalisation is left floating in the fit within this uncertainty. Similarly, the background normalisation is determined in the fit.",

Then the jet energy is corrected using simulation by comparing the jet to a geometrically matched particle jet ( R \u03b7 < 0.25). The correction for anti-k T R = 0.5 jets is +10 % at p T = 20 GeV and smaller at higher p T . The smallness of the correction is due to the use of the track p T in the particle flow algorithm. For comparison, the correction of ATLAS C/A R = 0.4 jets which are calculated from clusters calibrated to the response of single pions (LCW) is +33 % when a similar jet area correction has been applied before [102].

The original background distribution is peaked near 100 GeV and  trimming shifts it down by 60 GeV. The separation of signal and background is therefore improved by the application of trimming. To select events with top quarks, the trimmed fat jet mass is required to lie in a mass window around the true top quark mass. Other grooming techniques can be used instead of trimming.",

Trimming yields mass distributions similar to the ones of the trimmed anti-k T jets. The ungroomed C/A jets therefore contain more soft constituents that lie at large angles to the jet axis. This is what one naively expects from the larger radius parameter but C/A jets are not cone-like. Figure 21 shows the jet catchment area [105] for anti-k T and C/A jets for 40 < p T < 80 GeV. This area is calculated by including in the jet clustering a large number of ghosts which are distributed according to a fine grid in (y, \u03c6). The ghosts carry no significant energy such that they do not affect the kinematics of the jet. By looking at the ghosts which end up in the jet, the catchment area of the jet can be determined. The area of anti-k T jets is close to \u03c0 R 2 , with the peak for R = 0.6 being narrower than the one for R = 0.4, which is why it is reasonable to assume that the area will scale similarly when going to R = 1.0. For C/A R = 1.2 jets the distribution is much broader and the most probable area is 0.7 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 1.2 2 \u2248 \u03c0 , which corresponds to the area of anti-k T R = 1.0 jets. For approximately equal areas, the irregular shape of a C/A jet implies that it contains more constituents at large angles to the jet axis which leads to a larger mass. The average area for C/A jets is also slightly larger because the distribution is asymmetric with a more pronounced large area tail. ",

It frequently happens, because C/A ordering is by angular separation, that a soft protojet (or even a constituent) is combined with a hard protojet in the last step. The hard structure of the fat jet is then represented by the structure of the hard protojet. Therefore, mergings where one of the protojets has p T < \u03b4 p \u00d7 p fat jet T are skipped and the search for the last hard merging continues by decomposing the hard protojet. This procedure continues until the last hard merging has been found or the two protojets are both soft, too close to each other (specified by a parameter \u03b4 r of the algorithm), or the protojet is a constituent. In the last three cases, the fat jet is considered to be irreducible. The two protojets of the last hard merging are then decomposed following the same procedure. If for one (both) of them a last hard merging is found, the resulting three (four) protojets are taken as the hard subjets of the fat jet.",

This dataset is used to study the structure of non-top fat jets that occur in dijet or multijet production because no significant number of boosted top quarks were produced. An advantage of this dataset is that pile-up was very limited: approximately 22 % of the events had only one reconstructed primary vertex (with at least five tracks). This allows to study fat jets in the absence of pile-up and how the structure changes in the presence of a few additional vertices. Fat jets are reconstructed using the C/A algorithm with R = 1.2 and the anti-k T algorithm with R = 1.0. To show the effect of grooming, mass Footnote 8 continued parameter (cf. Sect. 6.1.2). For the filter jets this parameter is known because they are clustered inclusively. For the exclusive jets it is not immediately clear which constants should be chosen. One possibility to assign a radius parameter to an exclusively clustered jet is to use the minimal radius that would yield the same jet in inclusive clustering. To remove the uncertainty associated with choosing a radius parameter for the exclusive jets, the momenta of the (calibrated) filter jets are used. drop filtering (cf. Sects. 3.2.1, 3.4) is applied to the C/A jets. The mass drop criterion with \u03bc = 0.67 and v cut = 0.09 is used to identify two subjets which must be separated by R 1 2 \u2265 0.3. Compared to the original jet, a jet that satisfies this MD criterion exhibits a 2-prong structure like that expected from hadronic heavy particle decay (W , Z , or Higgs bosons): two hard subjets (each with p T > 15 % of the sum of the two subjet transverse momenta) and a significant mass increase when the two subjets are combined. The fraction of jets in this data sample that contain decay products of heavy particles is negligible. A jet that survives the splitting/filtering criteria is a background jet that displays the 2-prong pattern by accident.",

Substructure variable distributions will be shown in the following for anti-k T R = 1.0 jets which have been trimmed like the 2011 jets. The tt simulation is divided into two categories, contained and non-contained. A hadronically decaying top quark is said to be contained if all decay quarks are separated by less than R \u03b7 = 1.0 from the top quark flight direction. Figure 28 shows the normalised particle level measurement of the mass of C/A R = 1.2 jets before (left panel) and after splitting and filtering (right panel) for 300 < p T < 400 GeV in events with only one primary vertex, i.e., without pile-up. The mass is peaked between 70 and 80 GeV for the original jets and between 90 and 100 GeV for the split/filtered jets. The higher mass is explained by the requirement R 1 2 \u2265 0.3 used in the splitting. The PYTHIA prediction for the original jet mass spectrum (the one before splitting and filtering) tends to be too soft, with the ratio to the measured distribution varying between 1.2 and 0.8. Although this is within the measurement uncertainties, a clear trend is visible. The HERWIG++ prediction is too hard, within +30 % and \u221240 % of the data. The level of description by the simulation is similar for jet p T between 200 and 600 GeV and for anti-k T R = 1.0 jets (not shown). The shape of the mass distribution of split/filtered jets in Fig. 28b is well described, indicating that the problem lies in the simulation of soft hadrons.

This scaling is explained by two factors. First, the jet area of anti-k T jets is \u2248\u03c0 R 2 (cf. Sect. 7.1; Fig. 21). The amount of pile-up energy in a jet is proportional to the jet area because the pile-up energy is approximately equally distributed in (y, \u03c6). Another power of R results from the separation of the constituents (cf. (10)). The pile-up dependence of the C/A R = 1.2 jet mass is shown in Fig. 29b. The mass is 100 GeV and rises with 4.2(1) GeV per vertex. The jet mass is also shown for the jets that satisfy the mass drop criterion before filtering (labelled in the figure as after splitting only). These jets have a larger mass (150 GeV at N PV = 1) because the R 1 2 \u2265 0.3 cut enhances configurations with a geometrically induced higher mass (cf. (10)). The dependence on the number of vertices is reduced for these jets, but still significant at 2.9(3) GeV per vertex. Efficient pile-up removal is achieved in the filtering step: after applying filtering to the split jets (label after splitting/filtering), the slope is consistent with zero. The mass of the split/filtered jets is reduced (\u2248130 GeV) because only the three leading p T filter jets are used.",

Before grooming, the jet mass is peaked at 100-120 GeV and the description by the Monte Carlo generators is within \u00b110 % for the bulk of the distribution. The shift of the peak position with respect to Fig. 28 is in part due to the larger jet p T . In Fig. 30, HERWIG++ uses a refined UE model (colour reconnection model) [123] with parameters tuned to LHC data (tune UE7-2). The description of the jet mass by HER-WIG++ is improved by this model compared to Fig. 28 where the default UE model was used. Also the description by PYTHIA is improved, through the use of the parameter set AUET2B [74,75] which is tuned to LHC data and results in a better prediction than the AMBT1 set [64] used in Fig. 28 which was tuned to e + e \u2212 and Tevatron data. After trimming, the peak is at 20-40 GeV, with the Monte Carlo distributions within \u00b120 % of the data points up to 250 GeV. The fact that the ungroomed and the trimmed jet masses are well described by the simulation, where trimming reduces the mass by \u224880 GeV, demonstrates that pile-up contributions to jets as well their removal is well modelled in the simulation.",

Figure 31a shows the mass distribution for trimmed anti-k T R = 1.0 fat jets in the event sample obtained with the tt selection. The peak at the top quark mass results from hadronically decaying top quarks for which all decay products are captured in the fat jet. The peak at the W boson mass represents the cases in which the b-jet is not part of the fat jet. The average mass above 100 GeV is shown in Fig.  31b as a function of \u03bc. Within the statistical uncertainty of \u22485 GeV, no pile-up dependence is present. Figure 32 shows the jet mass distribution for different subjet multiplicities. The subjets are reconstructed with the k T algorithm using R = 0.3 and correspond to the subjets that remain after trimming and have p T > 17.5 GeV = 5 % \u00d7 350 GeV. All distributions are well described by the simulation as is the integrated distribution in Fig. 31a. The prediction for tt production is obtained from POWHEG with PYTHIA for the parton shower and hadronisation. For exactly one subjet, the fat jet mass peaks at 20-30 GeV and the fat jet results from hadronic top quark decays with more than one decay jet not captured, background from W+jets events, or production of single top quarks. With two subjets, the distribution peaks at the W boson mass, indicating that the subjets correspond to the two W boson decay jets. A shoulder towards higher masses is also visible, resulting from t \u2192 bqq decays in which the subjets correspond to one W boson decay jet and the b-jet, which has on average larger p T . A W boson peak is also visible for events with single top quarks, which therefore seem to contain a hadronically decaying W boson while still satisfying the requirements for an isolated muon and significant / E T . Fat jets with three subjets have a mass that The tt simulation is obtained from POWHEG with PYTHIA for the parton shower and hadronisation. Preliminary results from [102] peaks near the top quark mass and result mostly from SM tt events in which all top quark decay jets are contained in the fat jet. For four or more subjets, the high mass tail is more pronounced but is still described by tt production, indicating that energy from underlying event and/or pile-up is picked up. These studies suggest that the mass of trimmed anti-k T R = 1.0 jets with exactly three subjets is well suited for the identification of hadronically decaying top quarks.",

The distributions peak in the ranges 5-10 and 2.5-7.5 GeV, respectively. The uncertainties from unfolding (related mainly to the uncertainty with which the detector jet energy scale and resolution can be simulated) are \u00b120 % in the ranges 5-70 and 2.5-25 GeV, respectively, which contain the bulk of the data. The predicted distributions describe the data within these uncertainties. Trends are however visible, with the HERWIG++ spectrum being too hard and the one by PYTHIA too soft. Detector level distributions of the splitting scales are shown in Fig. 34 for jets in multijet events with an average pile-up \u03bc of 9.1. Compared to the no-pile-up case in Fig.  33, the horizontal axis now extends to much larger values of the scales and a logarithmic vertical axis is chosen to high-light the tails of the distributions. For \u221a d 12 < 100 GeV and \u221a d 23 < 40 GeV, the quality of the descriptions is similar to the no-pile-up case and describes the data within 10-20 %. A typical cut for top quark identification is \u221a d 12 > 40 GeV and the prediction at this value is within 10 % of the data. In the tails, POWHEG and HERWIG++ give a better prediction than PYTHIA. The PYTHIA spectra are too soft with the relative difference to the data points being \u224830 % for \u221a d 12 > 160 GeV and \u221a d 23 > 80 GeV. The HERWIG++ spectrum tends to be too hard for \u221a d 12 > 200 GeV. Grooming has little impact on the splitting scales and the quality of the simulation is similar for trimmed jets [106] (not shown).",

The simulated distribution is shifted by \u22488 GeV to higher masses. This difference to the observed mass is within the typical jet mass simulation uncertainty of 5-6 % found for fat jets [106]. Approximately 50 % of the fat jets sample are SM tt events and the other half is dominated by W+jets events. The HEPTopTagger top quark candidate masses are shown in Fig. 40b-d for different HEP-TopTagger parameter settings. The default-30 settings are used in Fig. 40b which shows a peak at the top quark mass that falls rapidly towards larger masses. The tail towards lower masses results from cases where not all energy associated with the top quark decay is recovered. These losses occur in the filtering and when not all decay products are contained in the fat jet. The effect on the mass distribution of tightening and loosening the filtering is shown in Fig. 40c,  d: tight settings enhance the tail with respect to the peak while loose settings reduce it. Which settings are optimal depends on the analysis and on the amount of background that needs to be rejected. The top candidate mass m t above 50 GeV is well described by the simulation.

In that case, a triplet of these objects cannot reconstruct the top quark. The value that was used in the HEPTopTagger analysis described in Sect.  Figure 41a shows the fat jet mass distribution for ATLAS events from 2012 that pass the semileptonic tt event selection, including a b-tag to reduce the W+jets background. The top quark purity of this sample of fat jets is 86 %. The fat jet mass exhibits a broad peak with a maximum at 180 GeV. The distribution predicted by the simulation is shifted towards higher masses. Between 200 and 350 GeV the shift is approximately 10 GeV, which corresponds to a relative change of 5 % at a mass of 200 GeV. As for 2011, this difference is covered by the typical fat jet simulation uncertainty [106]. The HEPTopTagger candidate mass, reconstructed using the default settings listed in Table 1, is shown in Fig. 41b. No peak is visible at low mass due to the use of m cut = 50 GeV. The top candidate mass is well described by the simulation. The HEPTopTagger increases the top quark purity to 98 % in the candidate mass window 140 < m t < 200 GeV. The number of top quark candidates reconstructed in this mass window in the data is 4210. As proposed in [124], the top quark mass peak can be used to calibrate the HEPTopTagger subjets and to evaluate the subjet energy simulation uncertainty.  Table 1. The tt simulation is from POWHEG+PYTHIA, the W+jets events from ALPGEN+PYTHIA, and single-top production in the s-channel with a leptonically decaying W boson is from MC@NLO. Preliminary results from [102] Distributions of substructure variables used by the HEP-TopTagger to apply kinematic cuts on the three identified subjet are shown in Fig. 42 for the top quark candidates with 140 < m t < 200 GeV. These variables are invariant mass ratios of combinations of the three (exclusive) subjets identified in the last step of the HEPTopTagger procedure (cf. Sect. 7.7). For example, the variable m 23 is the invariant mass of the subleading p T and the sub-subleading p T subjet, and the variable m 123 is the mass of all three subjets combined. The ratio m 23 /m 123 displayed in panel (a) shows a peak at m W /m t . This indicates that in most of the cases the leading p T subjet corresponds to the b-quark (but this information is not used in the HEPTopTagger). The distribution is well described by the simulation as is the quantity arctan(m 13 /m 12 ) in panel (b).  [102] seen for the generated semileptonic tt events that have been passed through a full ATLAS detector simulation under the same pile-up conditions. The numerical value of the reconstructed top quark mass depends on the choice of the mass window and is well predicted by the simulation.",

The top quark tagging efficiency per top quark is shown in panel (a) as a function of the top quark transverse momentum p T,t . The efficiency is a product of the efficiency to find a fat jet in the event and the efficiency to tag the fat jet. The former efficiency is close to 100 % for p T,t > 300 GeV. The efficiency shows a turn-on at p T,t \u2248 200 GeV and rises to a plateau of \u224840 % for p T,t > 500 GeV. The turn-on is a geometric effect, with more top quark decay products contained in the fat jet at larger p T . This is evident from a comparison with the efficiency obtained when using C/A R = 1.8 fat jet which is larger in the turn-on but equal to the R = 1.5 efficiency in the plateau. The plateau is given by the internal HEPTop-Tagger inefficiencies associated with the procedure that identifies the hard substructure (mass drop), the filtering, and the kinematic selection. Different choices of the HEPTopTagger parameters allow to tighten or loosen the top quark selection to achieve an optimal signal-to-background ratio (S/B). Typically tight settings are needed when the background is large and the fake rate needs to be kept as small as possible. Loose settings are possible if the background is small or has been reduced to a low level through other selection cuts. In this case a high efficiency is preferred. The tight and loose parameters are listed in Table 1. The tight settings include more aggressive filtering, through the use of a smaller filtering radius and a smaller number of kept filtered jets, and a smaller W boson mass window. For the loose settings, the filtering is relaxed (more jets are accepted) and the W boson mass window is widened. The tight HEPTopTagger settings reduce the efficiency to 30 % while the loose settings increase it to 44 %.",

The rate is shown as a function of the leading anti-k T R = 0.4 jet p T in the event to facilitate comparisons between taggers that use different definitions of fat jets. The fake rate shows a turn-on at \u2248200 GeV and rises to \u22484 % at 800 GeV and continues to rise slowly with p T . This turn-on is an effect of increased hard QCD radiation at large parton p T which increases the chance to fake the three prong structure of hadronic top quark decay. With tight settings, the fake rate is reduced from 4 % to 2.5 % at high p T . The fake rate with loose settings differs from that obtained with the default settings only in the turn-on. Figure 44c shows the fat jet tagging efficiency as a function of the fat jet p T for multijet events and W+jets events in which the W boson decays hadronically. For both types of events, the fake rate is \u22482.5 % for fat jet p T > 500 GeV, while the turn-on begins \u224850 GeV earlier for W+jets events.

The signal efficiency is the probability for tagging a hadronically decaying top quark and it depends heavily on the p T of the top quark, as shown for the HEPTopTagger in Fig. 44a. The mis-tag rate depends strongly on the fat jet p T (Fig. 44c). The performance should therefore be studied differentially in fat jet p T , otherwise the efficiencies and rejections are valid only for the p T spectra of the particular signal and background fat jet samples used in the study. A performance comparison is also limited to the particular choice of background fat jets: as shown in Fig. 44c, the fake rate is significantly different for dijet production and hadronic W boson decay for fat jet p T < 300 GeV.",

The performance is complicated by the fact that the two approaches use different definitions of fat jets. The HEPTopTagger uses C/A R = 1.5 jets and is optimised to filter out underlying event and pile-up contributions in the large jet area associated with this large radius parameter. The fat jets used for tagging with substructure variable cuts are in ATLAS traditionally reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm and use R = 1.0. A clean tagger comparison can be obtained by looking at the same signal and background events with both approaches and by comparing the tagged events (event-level efficiency and mis-tag rate). This approach is also best suited to answer the question of which tagger works best in a particular analysis because for an analysis the figure of merit is how many signal and background events survive the selection cuts.",

Such an environment is typically encountered in scenarios of New Physics models where new massive particles decay with large hadronic branching fractions. For the present study, \u221a s = 14 TeV pp collisions are used and small-R jets are constructed using the anti-k T algorithm with R = 0.4. Fat jets are constructed using the C/A algorithm with R = 1.5, and the efficiency and rejection of the HEPTopTagger is compared with those of cuts on the fat jet mass, p T , and the multiplicity of hard substructure objects inside the fat jet. In a real analysis, these substructure techniques would be combined with other requirements to increase the signal sensitivity. Many such requirements, e.g., cuts on / E T and b-tagging, factorise because the HEPTopTagger does not use the corresponding variables and the fat jet variables are not or only weakly correlated with those variables. The approach taken in this study is therefore to not consider other cuts and to look at the significance improvement rather than absolute values of S/ \u221a B. A supersymmetric extension of the SM (R-parity conserving SUSY) is used as the benchmark model for the comparison. Gluinos are pair-produced and decay to four top quarks and two neutralinos, as shown in Fig. 47a. Each gluino decays according tog \u2192tt \u2192tt\u03c7 0 1 , in which\u03c7 0 1 is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).

For signal and background, the N jet distribution is shifted towards higher values the more top tags are found. In other words, the probability for a top tag rises with the number of jets in the event. This behaviour can be understood as follows. The HEPTopTagger looks for hard substructure objects inside the fat jet. It then tries all permutations of three of the substructure objects and looks  if this triplet combines to a top quark. E.g., the (filtered) triplet has to fulfil the top quark mass constraint and two subjets have to fulfil the W boson mass constraint. The larger the small-R jet multiplicity, the higher the number of hard substructure objects and the probability increases that a triplet is found which satisfies the kinematic cuts (hits the mass windows).",

            "text": "The observed feature, that the tagging probability rises with the jet multiplicity is not limited to the HEPTopTagger. It is a general feature that affects all top taggers. The reason is that the more jets are in the event, the larger the probability that a combination of jets looks like hadronic top quark decay. The chance that the structure of a fat jet resembles hadronic top quark decay is higher if the fat jet has more subjets.  Experimentally, a minimal N jet cut is more natural than a requirement of exactly N jet small-R jets. Measuring an exact number of jets is harder and the systematic uncertainties are larger. Therefore, in the rest of this section, distributions like those in Fig. 49 are integrated over N jet , starting from a minimal value. Figure 50a shows the HEPTopTagger efficiency for at least one and at least two top tags in signal and background events as a function of the minimal number of required jets. The efficiency to find at least one top tag in SUSY events rises from 44 % at N jet \u2265 4 to 60 % for N jet \u2265 12. The efficiency to have at least a double-tag rises from 6 % to 18 %. The rise is due to mass window hits which are more likely at higher jet multiplicity. This effect is more dramatic for the fake rate which rises from 10 \u22124 at N jet \u2265 2 to 16 % at N jet \u2265 8 for single-tags. The rise of the signal efficiency is much smaller than that of the fake rate. The explanation is that for signal, the fat jets contain top quark decays and the efficiency is already high at low N jet . The plateau efficiency of the HEPTopTagger is \u224840 % when using full detector simulation (Sect. 9.1). The HEPTopTagger inefficiency of \u224860 % is due to mass drop filtering and mass cuts. High jet multiplicity in signal events helps reduce this inefficiency. E.g., a signal event that would have escaped detection because the top quark candidate has a mass larger than the maximum allowed value can be tagged if the excess energy is removed in the form of a radiated hard gluon. This gluon then gives rise to another jet in the event. The efficiency increase from such processes is relatively small because the mass windows are already designed for high signal efficiency.",

This implies that the signal fat jets for N jet \u2265 4 and those for N jet \u2265 7 have almost the same number of subjets. The subjets determine the kinematics of the fat jet. This is the reason why the distributions of the kinematic variables and the number of substructure objects do not change much for the signal fat jets when N jet is increased. The situation is quite different for fat jets in background events. These events have a falling jet multiplicity spectrum (Fig. 49b) and the fat jets in events with N jet \u2265 4 have fewer subjets than those in events with N jet \u2265 7. Consequently, the kinematics of background fat jets becomes more signal-like at high N jet . Figure 51a shows the leading fat jet p T . As expected, the background distribution is less well separated from the signal at high jet multiplicities. A cut p T > 500 GeV is used to enhance signal events. This cut and the cuts on the other fat jet quantities are chosen to ensure a high signal efficiency of at least 50 %. The leading p T fat jet mass is shown in panel (b) and the sum of the masses of all fat jets in the event in panel (c). Cuts m > 350 GeV and m > 800 GeV are used, respectively. The fat jet mass sum has been proposed in [126] to select top quark events in high multiplicity environments. The sum N sub of the number of substructure objects obtained by the HEPTopTagger after the mass drop requirement (\u03bc = 80 %, m cut = 50 GeV) in all fat jets in the event is shown in panel (d). A cut N sub > 10 is used. This variable is inspired by [127] in which the counting of subjets has been proposed as an effective discriminant. Systematic uncertainties on the fat jet mass and p T , and on the HEPTopTagger subjet calibrations have only a small impact on the efficiency: the relative uncertainty on the efficiency is a few percent for all investigated methods.",

Multijet events with a b-tag have, on average, larger b-jet p T and, because of the vicinity matching between the b-jet and the fat jet, this implies larger fat jet p T . The top quark fake rate is therefore larger in b-tagged multijet events. The analysis could be made insensitive to this correlation by applying the background estimation in bins of fat jet p T (or in bins of m tt because high invariant masses are reached in multijet events only if the fake top candidates are back-to-back).

A clear peak is visible near the top quark mass with a tail to larger masses. The position of the peak is approximately described by the simulation (mostly SM tt production), although the prediction seems shifted to lower values by \u224810 GeV. This shift corresponds to 6 % at the top quark mass, much more than the 1 % uncertainty that was extracted from the description of the W boson mass peak. The larger discrepancy for the top quark mass peak could be related to the fact that the b-jet in t \u2192 bqq decay has on average the largest p T of all decay quark jets (see for example Fig.  42a and its discussion). The uncertainty on the simulation of the higher p T subjets therefore seems to be larger than that for the lower p T subjets from W boson decay. Using only the W boson mass peak to determine the subjet energy scale uncertainty is therefore not recommended because it does not sample the full phase space relevant to a top quark analysis.",

The control region is defined by selecting 1 + 2 events in which the W boson candidate and the W+b candidate satisfy the mass window requirements to make the selection kinematically similar to the signal region but the mass drop requirement on the W candidate is inverted to remove signal-like events. The events in this control region are then used to study the tagging of the fat jet in the hemisphere opposite the W+b candidate. The fake top tagging rate is shown in Fig. 67. It is approximately 0.1 % at the threshold and plateaus at 6 % for p T > 600 GeV. The rise in the mis-tag rate is due to increased QCD radiation at large p T which can fake the top quark decay pattern. The top quark tagging efficiency is also shown. It is 8 % at fat jet p T = 350 GeV, rises to 20 % at 400 GeV and reaches a plateau of 50 % for p T > 500 GeV. The efficiency rise is a geometric effect that results from the decay products being more collimated at large p T , eventually all being contained inside the fat jet with R = 0.8.",

The W+b tag is required in 1 + 2 events and for 1 + 1 events a random one of the two fat jets is required to be top tagged. These samples are dominated by multijet events. The multijet contribution remaining after the second top tag requirement is determined by weighting these events with the fake rate at the p T of the fat jet in the hemisphere opposite to the first tag ('probe jet'). However, the probe jets have a systematically smaller mass than those in the signal region because the majority of them are not tagged. To correct for this kinematic bias, the mass of the probe jet is ignored and replaced by a mass drawn randomly from the distribution of simulated multijet events in the range 140-250 GeV. A systematic uncertainty is assigned by taking half the difference between the m tt distributions resulting from the described procedure and when not correcting the kinematic bias.

The trigger uncertainty is taken to be half the trigger inefficiency predicted by simulation. For masses larger than 2.5 TeV, the biggest uncertainty results from the finite statistics of the single-tag multijets sample.

In the mass ranges 0.9 < m tt < 1.1 TeV and 1.3 < m tt < 2.4 TeV, the statistical error on the estimated background in the final selection is quoted to be better than 1 %. This follows from the high statistics in the loose selection. The background uncertainty is dominated by the systematic error which is described as resulting \"from the systematic uncertainty assigned to the procedure for modifying probe-jet masses\" and which is 3-5 %, depending on the mass range and the event topology (1+1, 1+2) [120]. The statistical uncertainty on the fake rate is quoted to be \"ranging from <1 % at 1 TeV/c 2 to \u2248 10 % at 3 TeV/c 2 \" [120]. Unfortunately, no mention is made of how the small uncertainties on the fake rate are arrived at; the error bars in Fig.  67 correspond to much larger uncertainties. Figure 69a, b show the limits for the narrow-width Z boson and the Kaluza-Klein gluon, respectively. Below 1 TeV the multijet background is prohibitively large and the selection is inefficient for the signal models. No limits are therefore evaluated for this parameter space. The limit for the Z model is calculated assuming a width of 1.0 % which is much smaller than the m tt detector resolution of \u224810 %.   Any resonance width smaller than 10 % will be broadened by detector resolution. For this reason it is possible to compare the Z 1.2 % width model with the 1.0 % limit. The 1.2 % width Z boson model is the benchmark model also used in the ATLAS analyses (Figs. 57, 62, 65) and the cross section predictions are identical (including a scaling of the leading order prediction by a factor of 1.3). This model can be excluded at 95 % confidence level at m Z = 1 TeV and in the range \u22481.33-1.46 TeV. Compared to the HEP-TopTagger analysis, the upper mass limit is 140 GeV higher. The HEPTopTagger analysis, on the other hand, provides a limit for masses below 1 TeV.",

For multijet ATLAS events, the shape of the / E T / \u221a H T distribution is found to be approximately independent of the small-R jet multiplicity N jet and of M J . The multijet background in the signal regions can therefore be determined using / E T / \u221a H T templates from multijet-dominated control regions at lower N jet . The multijet background template is taken from N jet = 6 events and the other backgrounds are subtracted from the template. Separate templates are used for the different b-tag multiplicities because neutrinos from heavy quark decay contribute to / E T but not to H T . A correction is applied to account for small changes in the ratio that result from non-jet contributions to / E T which do not appear in H T . The correction amounts to reweighting the distribution of non-jet p T in the control region to that in the signal region. The closure of this method is tested for intervals at smaller / E T / \u221a H T than in the signal regions and observed deviations are used as systematic uncertainties. The closure uncertainties typically are 5 to 15 %, reaching up to \u224850 % in control regions with small statistics. Figure 71 shows the / E T / \u221a H T distribution in control regions with (a) N jet = 7 for the selection with at least two b-tags and (b) the requirement M J > 340 GeV. The data are well described for / E T / \u221a H T < 4 \u221a GeV, where multijet events dominate. The closure uncertainties are determined in this region. The leptonic tt background becomes important at higher values where deviations from the data are seen in some bins. The tt background carries an uncertainty of \u224850 % when combining experimental and theoretical sources as discussed below. Within this uncertainty, the description is compatible with the data. The control regions can potentially be contaminated with New Physics events, as illustrated in the figure.

The multijet prediction is taken from the measured distribution with exactly six jets and after subtracting the simulated leptonic backgrounds. The tt and W+jets backgrounds are generated with SHERPA and normalised in control regions. Singletop production is generated with MC@NLO in the s-channel and with AcerMC in the t-channel. Also shown is the distribution of a SUSY model with m(g) = 900 GeV and m(\u03c7 0 1 ) = 150 GeV, generated with MadGraph+HERWIG++. The distribution is shown after requiring a at least two b-tags and b the sum of the masses of anti-k T R = 1.0 jets in the event to exceed 340 GeV. From [140], used under CC BY 4.0 and unchanged from original in the figure are m(g) = 900 GeV and m(\u03c7 0 1 ) = 150 GeV, which are excluded by the analysis of the signal regions as discussed below. The possible contamination is therefore smaller than that shown in Fig. 71 (20-30 events per 4 \u221a GeV). The most important leptonic backgrounds are from W+jets events and tt production and the dominant contributions result from decays to \u03c4 leptons which decay hadronically. The decays to electrons and muons are suppressed because of the electron and muon vetos. These backgrounds are taken from SHERPA simulations which are fitted to data in control regions. The control regions contain exactly one isolated muon or electron and the lepton four-momentum is used to create an additional jet that is included in the calculation of H T . In this way, / E T / \u221a H T is made similar to its value in events with hadronic \u03c4 decay. A simultaneous fit is performed to the signal and control regions, as discussed below, to determine the SM contribution and potential contributions from New Physics.",

Jets with a smaller radius parameter approach the minimal hadronic cluster size. However, at high top quark p T , the size of HEPTopTagger subjets becomes smaller than R = 0.2. This is illustrated in [124] by modifying the HEPTopTagger to explicitly require all subjets to have R \u2265 0.2 and setting the minimal filter radius and the minimal distance in the mass drop procedure to 0.2. This modified algorithm is labelled HEPTopTagger' and its tagging efficiency is shown together with that of the HPTTopTagger and the original HEPTopTagger in Fig. 75a as a function of the top quark p T . 9 The efficiency of the HEPTopTagger' is less than 4 % for p T > 800 GeV. This implies that by restricting the algorithm to operate with jets of size and separated by \u22650.2 in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space (the approximate limit imposed by calorimeter granularity), it is not possible to find top quarks at high p T . As a solution it was suggested in [124] to use the reconstructed top mass peak in tt events to calibrate the HEPTopTagger and obtain simulation uncertainties by comparing with the peak position measured in data. Then the HEPTopTagger can be run in its original form, keeping subjets of size R < 0.2. 9 The generated events are passed through the Delphes simulation of the ATLAS detector and the distribution of the distance R \u03b7 between the reconstructed top quark candidate and the top quark peaks at zero and falls smoothly with the distance. The tagging efficiency in Fig. 75a is defined such that for the top quark to be tagged, a reconstructed top quark candidate must be found within R \u03b7 = 0.6, which is an arbitrary choice but it serves to illustrate the difference in tagger efficiencies. Calibrations and uncertainties for the HPTTopTagger can be obtained in a similar way. The minimal radius parameter for the filter track jets in the HPTTopTagger is taken to be 0.05 and it remains to be seen what the simulation uncertainties are for such jets in the ATLAS or CMS detector. As shown in Fig. 75a, the HPTTopTagger retains an efficiency of \u224824 % stably up to transverse momenta of 3 TeV (the full tested range) while the HEPTopTagger efficiency drops from \u224832 % for 800 < p T < 1000 GeV to \u224813 % for 2600 < p T < 3000 GeV. This drop was shown (Fig. 75b) to be due to the segmentation of the calorimeter because the effect is reproduced at the particle level when segmenting the particles into cells of size 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 (adding all their momenta). With segmentation the particle-level efficiency niques have been reviewed. The techniques are based on large (fat) jets which are used to capture all products of hadronic top quark decay t \u2192 bqq.",

For background jets the values are much lower because the transverse momenta in their mergings are more asymmetric. Trimming affects signal jets only slightly but has a significant impact on the background jets. The distributions for C/A fat jets are similar.

The ATLAS tracking efficiency is 80 % at p T = 500 MeV and rises to \u224886 % for p T = 10 GeV and higher [64,141]. The used efficiency therefore corresponds to a 10 % relative loss of efficiency at high p T which is considered conservative. The impact of the tracking efficiency on the HPTTopTagger performance is small because of the scaling to the calorimeter energy (\u03b1 j ).
