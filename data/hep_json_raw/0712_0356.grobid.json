Since 1964, when the quark model was first proposed, we have known that baryons and mesons are all made up of quarks and antiquarks. One would therefore expect that by now we could have figured out exactly how quarks fit into the hadrons and lead to their observable properties, mass, size, spin, charges and curents. But Nature is much more devious, and does not allow easy insight into its workings. One of the tools that has been successfully used to gain insight into the structure of hadrons is the measurement of electromagnetic form factors as a function of momentum transfer.",

Following the Fermilab measurements, Hyer 5 reported predictions for timelike form factors within the pQCD formalism including Sudakov suppression. Hyer's predictions, showed large sensitivity to the assumed distribution amplitude, but did not address the question of the experimental ratio R \u2248 2. Iachello and Wan 6 gave made predictions based on a picture of the bare meson surrounded by a vector meson cloud. As shown in Fig. 1  In order to explain the ratio R \u2248 2 Kroll and collaborators 7 proposed the diquark-quark model of the nucleon. While this model has at least two extra parameters, it explains both spacelike and timelike G p M (|Q 2 |), and R \u2248 2 very nicely. The three predictions mentioned above are shown in Fig. 1 (right), where the more recent results for G p M (|Q 2 |) from the e + e \u2212 annihilation measurments by Cornell 8 at |Q 2 | = 13.5 GeV 2 , by BES 9 at ten values of |Q 2 | = 4 \u2212 9.4 GeV 2 , and by BaBar 10 using ISR from \u03a5(4S) at |Q 2 | = 3.6 \u2212 20.3 GeV 2 are also shown.

It was noted by Milana et al. 13 that for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , A ggg and A \u03b3gg are negligably small, so that B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ).

None of the theoretical calculations, which exist only for pions, come even close to the experimental results. In absence of precsion experimental results this could be tolerated. Now there is no excuse. The theorists must now go back to work on new QCD-based models for form factors which are among the most important measures of hadron structure. It is interesting to note that no help is expected in this endeavour from Lattice practitioners who work in Euclidean time. For the experimentalists, the challenge is to extend the precision measurements to as large momentum transfers as possible, and to other mesons and baryons. BES III is ideally placed to meet this challenge.",
