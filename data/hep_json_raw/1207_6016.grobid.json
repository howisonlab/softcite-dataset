            "text": "The spectrum of the known cs states is at present described as two S-wave states (D + s , D * + s ) with spin-parity assignment J P = 0 \u2212 , 1 \u2212 and four P-wave states (D * s0 (2317) + , D s1 (2460) + , D s1 (2536) + , D * s2 (2573) + ) with J P = 0 + , 1 + , 1 + , 2 + [1], of which the latter two have also been observed in semileptonic B-decays in LHCb [2]. This picture is still controversial since the D * s0 (2317) + and D s1 (2460) + states, discovered in 2003 [3][4][5][6], were predicted to have much higher masses [7][8][9][10][11]. Between 2006 and 2009, three new D sJ mesons were observed at the B factories in DK and D * K decay modes 1 and in three-body b-hadron decays: the D * s1 (2700) + [12][13][14], the D * sJ (2860) + [12,14] and the D sJ (3040) + [14] excited states. From the angular analyses in refs. [13,14], J P = 1 \u2212 is favoured for the D * s1 (2700) + state, a possible J P = 3 \u2212 assignment is discussed for the D * sJ (2860) + , and an unnatural parity is suggested for the D sJ (3040) + state since it was found to decay only to the D * K final state.",

In the latest analysis by the BaBar collaboration [14], the observation of the D * sJ (2860) + decaying to the D * K final state rules out the J P = 0 + assignment, and the measured branching fraction ratio B(D * sJ (2860) + \u2192 D * K)/B(D * sJ (2860) + \u2192 DK) = 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 is in conflict with theoretical predictions for different spin assignments [16][17][18][19].

            "text": "The LHCb detector [22] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift-tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum resolution \u2206p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter 2 resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ) with respect to the beam direction. Charged hadrons are identified using two ringimaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and pre-shower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a muon system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction. Monte Carlo simulated event samples are used to calculate the effects of the detector on the mass resolution. The pp collisions are generated using Pythia 6.4 [23] with a specific LHCb configuration [24].

This requirement ensures that the meson candidates are produced in the primary pp interaction, and reduces the contribution from particles originating from b-hadron decays. The D + and K 0 S , and similarly D 0 and K + candidates, are fitted to a common vertex requiring \u03c7 2 /ndf < 8, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom. The purity of the charmed meson candidates is enhanced by requiring the decay products to be identified by the ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, using the difference in the log-likelihood between the kaon and pion hypotheses \u2206 ln L K\u03c0 .

The average difference between the generated and fitted values for the D * s1 (2700) + and D * sJ (2860) + masses and widths is taken as the systematic uncertainty. We repeat the reference fit changing the lower bound of the fit range by \u00b110 MeV/c 2 and the upper bound by \u221250 MeV/c 2 . This has the largest effect on the width of the D * s1 (2700) + state since the broad width is sensitive to modifications in the amount of background near the threshold and in the long high-mass tail. Finally we evaluate a systematic uncertainty given by the effect of fixing some of the background parameters in the reference fit. We perform a set of fits accounting for all possible up and down variations (independently and simultaneously) of these parameters. The variations are of 10% for D + K 0 S background parameters and of 5% in the case of the D 0 K + decay mode. According to a fit \u03c7 2 study, alternative fits with larger variations of the fixed parameters do not describe the data correctly and therefore not used to compute systematic uncertainties. We adopt as systematic uncertainty the root-mean-square variation of all the fits for the given parameter. As expected, this effect contributes mainly to the widths of the resonances since these parameters correlate strongly with the background shape. The total background model systematic uncertainty is the quadratic combination of the four effects discussed.",
