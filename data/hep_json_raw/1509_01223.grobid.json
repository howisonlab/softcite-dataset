Thanks to the unmatched radio-purity of the scintillator, and to the well understood detector response at low energy, a new limit on the stability of the electron for decay into a neutrino and a single mono-energetic photon was obtained. This new bound, \u03c4 \u2265 6.6\u00d710 28 yr at 90 % C.L., is two orders of magnitude better than the previous limit.",

Despite the present undisputed va-lidity of this law, experimental tests of charge conservation remain a way to search for physics beyond the Standard Model, and deserve to be investigated with the highest possible sensitivity. An experimental search for the hypothetical charge non-conserving decay of the electron, which is the lightest known charged particle, into a neutrino and a photon is reported in this paper. No presently viable theory predicts such a decay, and a large charge violation is excluded by the absence of macroscopic effects in matter. The electron decay is, however, discussed in the literature, e.g. [1][2][3][4][5][6] and references therein.",

This earlier measurement used PXE scintillator [17], and set a lower limit for the lifetime of this electron decay mode of 4.6 \u00d7 10 26 yr [18]. The work reported here uses a mixture of PC and PPO scintillating solution in the Borexino detector instead. A sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude is obtained thanks to a larger fiducial mass, higher statistics, lower background, and significantly improved data analysis. The latter is the result of a deeper understanding of the detector energy response, obtained by extensive calibration campaigns [19] and encoded in a tuned Geant4 simulation.",

This requires very precise fitting models to keep the systematic uncertainties at or below the statistical fluctuations of approximately 0.14%. A consequence of 14 C decays is a non-negligible occurrence of pile-up events, when two or more independent decays (mostly 14 C) occur close enough in time not to be separated. Two events can be distinguished with >50% efficiency when they are separated by more than 230 ns. The energy spectrum of pile-up events in the region of interest above the 14 C end-point is similar to the electron recoil spectrum induced by pp solar neutrinos. The pile-up spectrum obtained for the measurement of pp neutrinos [15], shown in magenta in Fig.1, is included as a separate component in the spectral fit used in this analysis and labeled \"synthetic\" pile-up. The synthetic pile-up spectrum is constructed by overlapping triggered events with PMT hits recorded in the tail of the acquisition gate of such events, well after the triggered scintillation pulse has decayed away. These late PMT hits represent a data-driven, threshold-less and random sample of activity (data + noise) in the detector. Added to triggered events they boost the pile-up contribution by a known amount, allowing the pile-up spectrum to be extracted.",

In the previous 7 Be solar neutrino analysis [11] this problem was solved by using a generalised \u0393function [23] to fit the mono-energetic 210 Po peak. However, while the quality of the fit to the 210 Po peak is insensitive to the residual deviations in the tails, this is not the case for the 14 C spectrum as all the events in the fraction of the 14 C spectrum above the 14 C end-point originate from spectral smearing so that the statistics in the tails are much higher.

This function has two free parameters \u00b5 and s, which can be evaluated using an expected mean and variance. The agreement of this approximation with the detector response function was tested with the Borexino MC model. It was found at low energies that the function (5) reproduces the scintillation line shape much better than a generalised \u0393-function (GGF) up to statistics of 10 8 events per bin, while at energies just above the 14 C tail both distributions give comparable results. Therefore the SPD approximation was adopted, and the quality of the fit was estimated using a \u03c7 2 criterion. As an example, with 10 7 mono-energetic events for n=50 (approximately 140 keV) we found \u03c7 2 /n.d.f.=88.0/61 for the GGF compared to \u03c7 2 /n.d.f.=59.3/61 for the SPD. In this example the events were uniformly distributed in the detector before the FV is selected. As proven by MC calculations, the SPD works well in the region of interest despite the additional smearing due to the aforementioned factors. This is a result of the folding of the relatively narrow non-statistical distributions by the much wider base function. The MC shows that such an absorption results in the smearing of the total distribution without changing its shape.",

Since the underlying 14 C \u03b2-spectrum is falling exponentially, a shift of the peak position to lower energy decreases the sensitivity of the search and vice versa. In the present analysis the kB parameter is fixed at kB = 0.0109 cm \u2022 MeV \u22121 , determined from calibration data with mono-energetic \u03b3 sources. In order to study the related systematics in a model independent way, the position of the \u03b3-peak within the bounds was obtained by calibration (1%) instead of varying the kB value. It should be noted that no degradation of the fit quality for a wide range of kB values was observed, due to the absence of known \u03b3-sources in the region of interest and, therefore, in the fit model. The final result is that kB error adds less than 2% to the total systematic error.",

The probability profiles were renormalised to physical regions, excluding non-physical values in case of a negative number of candidates where the region below zero was cut and the p.d.f. was renormalised to unity. The final probability profile was obtained as the weighted sum of the separate p.d.f.s, with the weights being the probability of occurrence of the corresponding value of the parameter. The normal distribution was used for both the error on the FV and for the relative shift of the 256 keV \u03b3 with respect to the electrons scale. The addition of the total systematic error degrades the purely statistical result by about 8%.",
