Inclusive and differential cross-sections are measured for events containing a Z boson decaying into electrons or muons and produced in association with at least one or at least two b-jets with transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and rapidity |y| < 2.5. Predictions from several Monte Carlo generators based on leading-order (LO) or next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix elements interfaced with a parton-shower simulation and testing different flavour schemes for the choice of initial-state partons are compared with measured cross-sections. The 5-flavour number scheme predictions at NLO accuracy agree better with data than 4-flavour number scheme ones. The 4-flavour number scheme predictions underestimate data in events with at least one b-jet.",

In the 5FNS, b-quark density is allowed in the initial state via a b-quark PDF, with the b-quark typically being massless. Therefore, in the 5FNS the Z + b-jets crosssection is sensitive to the b-quark PDF and can be used to constrain it. The ambiguity among the schemes is an intrinsic property of the calculation and is expected to reduce with the inclusion of higher order perturbative corrections [3].",

            "text": "The data used in this measurement were recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The candidate events were selected by either a single-electron or single-muon trigger that imposed a minimum transverse energy (transverse momentum) threshold for the electron (muon) channel and quality and isolation requirements, which depended on the LHC running conditions. The threshold in 2015 was 24 (20) GeV for the electrons (muons), satisfying loose isolation requirements. Due to the higher instantaneous luminosity in 2016, the threshold was increased to 26 GeV for both the electrons and the muons, and a more restrictive isolation requirement was imposed on both leptons along with more restrictive identification requirements for electrons. Triggers with higher thresholds but with no isolation requirement or with loosened identification criteria were also used to increase the efficiency. Crossings of proton bunches occurred every 25 ns, the collisions achieved a peak instantaneous luminosity of 1.37 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , and the mean number of pp interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) was \u00b5 = 24. After applying criteria to ensure good ATLAS detector operation, the total integrated luminosity amounts to 35.6 fb \u22121 . The uncertainty in the combined 2015-2016 integrated luminosity is 2.1% [23], obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [24] for the primary luminosity measurements.",

Matrix elements were calculated for up to five partons, and merged using the MLM prescription [40] with a matching scale of 15 GeV. Alpgen uses the 4FNS with massive b-and c-quarks in the matrix element and in the parton shower of Pythia. The matrix elements for the production of Z + bb and Z + cc events are explicitly included and a heavy-flavour overlap procedure is used to remove the double counting, between the matrix element and the parton shower, of heavy quarks from gluon splitting. The properties of b-and c-hadron decays were simulated with EvtGen v1.2.0 [41], as was done in all generated samples where the parton shower was simulated with Pythia. Pho-tos++ v3.52 [42,43] was used to simulate QED final-state radiation (FSR). The Alpgen samples are used in the analysis to estimate systematic uncertainties in the unfolding procedure and in backgrounds containing a genuine Z boson. In section 9 these samples are referred to as Alpgen + Py6 4FNS (LO). Samples of Z(\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ), W (\u2192 \u03bd), and W (\u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) events were simulated with Sherpa, using the same set-up adopted for the signal samples. The Z-boson and W -boson samples are normalised to the inclusive next-to-next-toleading-order (NNLO) cross-section predictions provided by the FEWZ 3.1 program [44][45][46][47] with the CT14 PDF set. The K-factor applied to the Z samples to match the NNLO prediction is 0.975 for Sherpa and 1.196 for Alpgen.",

The h damp parameter, which regulates the high-p T emissions against which the tt system recoils, is set to 1.5 m top [52]. The events were interfaced with Pythia v8.230 [53] using the A14 tune [54]. The tt sample is normalised to the theory prediction at NNLO in QCD including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) softgluon terms [55][56][57][58][59][60][61]. Four additional tt samples were simulated to evaluate the un-JHEP07(2020)044 certainty in this process, as described in [52]. One sample was produced with Mad-Graph5 aMC@NLO [62] and the same parton-shower model of the nominal tt sample in order to estimate the uncertainty due to the modelling of the hard scattering process. A second Powheg-Box sample showered with Herwig 7.13 [63,64] was generated to evaluate the uncertainty due to the modelling of the parton shower and hadronization processes. A third sample was produced to simulate higher energy radiation with the factorisation and renormalisation scales changed by a factor of 0.5 while simultaneously increasing the h damp value to 3.0 m top and using the upper variation of the initial state radiation (ISR) from the A14 tune. The last sample simulates the lower energy radiation. It was generated with the renormalisation and factorisation scales varied by a factor of 2.0 while keeping the h damp value at 1.5 m top and using the ISR downward variation in the parton shower. The last two samples are also used to estimate the impact of FSR with parton-shower weights that vary the renormalisation scale for QCD emission in the FSR by factors of 0.5 and 2.0.",

The first sample, referred to as Sherpa Zbb 4FNS (NLO), includes Z + bb events generated in the 4FNS at NLO with massive b-quarks. It is interesting to compare this sample, which contains two b-quarks in the matrix elements, with the unfolded data even in the case of distributions with at least one b-jet, to understand if there are regions of the phase space that can be described with such a configuration. The second sample, referred to as Sherpa Fusing 4FNS+5FNS (NLO), contains the matrix elements at NLO for up to two partons, and matrix elements at LO for up to three partons. It includes both Z + bb events generated in the 4FNS at NLO with massive b-quarks, and Z+jets events generated in the 5FNS at NLO. They are combined according to the procedure described in ref. [81]. The combination is achieved by means of a dedicated heavy-flavour overlap removal procedure, the fusing technique, that acts as an additional step after the multijet merging algorithms. This procedure combines the advantages of inclusive 5FNS calculations with the higher precision of 4FNS calculations in regions of phase space where the b-quark mass sets a relevant scale. The two Sherpa samples use the NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF set with \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 and the corresponding number of active quark flavours. Masses of c-and b-quarks are taken into account in the parton shower in all Sherpa samples.",

The multijet background estimate in the pre-tag region is then extrapolated to the two signal regions using normalisation factors equal to the fraction of events in the multijet control region that satisfy the 1-tag and 2-tag requirements. Contributions from non-multijet processes are subtracted before estimating this fraction. Systematic uncertainties are assessed by varying the m range and the binning of the fit, excluding the Z-boson peak from the fit, performing the fit in the tagged regions in place of the pre-tag ones, and by allowing the other processes to be varied independently in the fit.

This is evaluated for each observable JHEP07(2020)044 by reweighting the generator-level distribution in the Sherpa samples to provide a better description of the data at detector level. The modified Sherpa samples are then used to emulate data and are unfolded with the nominal simulated sample. An additional source accounts for the possible mismodelling of an observable that is not one of the unfolded observables (i.e. a hidden variable). This uncertainty is evaluated by reweighting, in the Sherpa samples, the generator-level distribution of the leading lepton's p T , which is one of the observables showing the largest mismodelling, to provide a better description of the data at detector level. The modified Sherpa samples are used to unfold the data. The effect of the hidden variable's mismodelling is negligible for all considered variables and all bins. A third uncertainty source accounts for the different hadronisation and parton-shower models used for the signal simulation. This uncertainty is evaluated by unfolding the Alpgen signal samples, which emulate the background-subtracted data, with the Sherpa signal samples. The generator-level distributions from the Alpgen samples are first reweighted to agree with Sherpa in order to remove effects related to shape differences. The difference between the generator-level distribution and the unfolded Alpgen reweighted distribution is taken as the uncertainty. For the inclusive cross-section, the modelling uncertainty is estimated by replacing the unfolding factor computed with Sherpa with the one computed with Alpgen. The dependence on the size of the simulated sample is derived using pseudoexperiments, and the spread of the results is taken as an uncertainty.

The differential cross-sections as a function of the Z-boson rapidity and of the leading b-jet rapidity for events with at least one b-jet are shown in figure 9. All MC predictions provide a satisfactory description of the shape of the data. Some modulation relative to data is observed in the leading b-jet |y| distribution, in some cases beyond the experimental uncertainty. Figure 10 (right) shows the differential cross-section as a function of \u2206y Zb . Sherpa 5FNS (NLO) and Sherpa Fusing 4FNS+5FNS (NLO) describe the data quite well, while all other predictions exhibit a slightly smaller rapidity separation than data, even if within the uncertainty of the data. Use of a different PDF set as in Alpgen predictions leads to a change in the distribution, but the differences are small compared with the experimental uncertainties. The distribution of \u2206\u03c6 Zb is sensitive to the presence of additional radiation in the event. In fixed order calculations of the Z + 1b process, the LO matrix element provides contributions only for \u2206\u03c6 Zb = \u03c0, while the NLO matrix element is the first order which populates the region of \u2206\u03c6 Zb < \u03c0. In MC simulations the region below \u03c0 is populated via parton shower and via merging of parton shower with multi-parton matrix elements. Therefore the region of small azimuthal separation between the Z boson and the leading b-jet is the most sensitive to additional QCD radiation and soft corrections. It is also sensitive to the presence of boosted particles decaying into a Z boson and b-quarks. The differential cross-section as a function of \u2206\u03c6 Zb for events with at least one b-jet is shown in figure 10 (left). The Sherpa 5FNS (NLO) generator provides the best agreement with data. Sherpa Fusing 4FNS+5FNS (NLO) is still consistent with data within the experimental uncertainty in most of the bins, but a small difference between the two simulations is observed for small values.

The differential cross-sections as a function of \u2206\u03c6 bb and of \u2206y bb are shown in figure 12. Most of the predictions provide satisfactory descriptions of the data within the large experimental uncertainties. Disagreement between data and MGaMC + Py8 Zbb 4FNS (NLO) is observed at low values of \u2206\u03c6 bb . Mismodelling of \u2206y bb is observed for Alpgen. This observable has some sensitivity to PDFs, but that is below the experimental uncertainties. The \u2206R bb observable is sensitive to the various production mechanisms of the Zbb JHEP07(2020)044 final state. The region at low \u2206R bb is dominated by the production of two b-jets from gluon splitting. Probing this region requires two b-jets in the final state, so it is not sensitive to very small angles of the splitting. The interplay of the modelling of \u2206\u03c6 bb and \u2206y bb in Alpgen + Py6 4 FNS (LO) influences the prediction of the \u2206R bb distribution shown in figure 13 (left). All Sherpa predictions describe the shape of this observable quite well, featuring a substantial improvement at low \u2206R bb relative to the LO version reported by ATLAS using data at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Overall, this is consistent with the results presented in the ATLAS measurement of gluon-splitting properties at \u221a s = 13 TeV [11]. MGaMC + Py8 Zbb 4FNS (NLO) presents a large mismodelling at low \u2206R bb , which is the part of the phase space dominated by gluon splitting. The invariant mass of the two leading b-jets is an important observable in the measurement of associated ZH production with Higgs boson decays into bb, and in searches for physics beyond the SM in the same final state. The differential cross-section as a function of m bb for events with at least two b-jets is shown in figure 13 (right). All Sherpa JHEP07(2020)044 predictions provide a quite good model of the shape of this observable's distribution up to about 300 GeV, while the other predictions show various discrepancies in this region. This is particularly evident for MGaMC + Py8 Zbb 4FNS (NLO), and it is consistent with the mismodelling observed at low \u2206R bb , the region dominated by gluon splitting. In the high mass range all predictions underestimate the data, resulting in a sizeable mismodelling. Hence the use of these predictions for the background estimate in searches for physics beyond the SM in this final state could be problematic.",

Predictions of Zbb at NLO accuracy agree with data only in the two-b-jets case, and underestimate the data in the case of events with at least one b-jet. Overall, Sherpa 5FNS (NLO), a 5FNS generator with matrix elements at NLO for up to two partons and matrix elements at LO for up to four partons, describes the various differential distributions within the experimental uncertainties. A significant discrepancy, common to all generators, is found for large values of m bb .
