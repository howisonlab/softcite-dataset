The measurements were made for boson virtualities Q 2 > 125 GeV 2 with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 82 pb \u22121 and the jets were identified in the Breit frame. The performance and suitability of the jet algorithms for their use in hadron-like reactions were investigated by comparing the measurements to those performed with the k T algorithm. Nextto-leading-order QCD calculations give a good description of the measurements. Measurements of the ratios of cross sections using different jet algorithms are also presented; the measured ratios are well described by calculations including up to O(\u03b1 3 s ) terms. Values of \u03b1 s (M Z ) were extracted from the data; the results are compatible with and have similar precision to the value extracted from the k T analysis.",

These studies demonstrated that this jet algorithm results in the smallest uncertainties in the reconstruction of jets in ep collisions. The k T algorithm is well suited for ep collisions and yields infrared-and collinear-safe cross sections at any order of pQCD. However, it might not be best suited to reconstruct jets in hadronhadron collisions, such as those at the LHC. In order to optimise the reconstruction of jet observables in such environments, new algorithms were recently developed, like the anti-k T [21], a recombination-type jet algorithm, and the \"Seedless Infrared-Safe\" cone (SIScone) [22] algorithms. The measurements of jet cross sections in NC DIS using these algorithms provide additional tests of QCD and also a test of their performance with data in a well understood hadron-induced reaction.",

The analysis is based on the same data sample which was used in recent publications [4,5] to make crosssection measurements with the k T jet algorithm.

Furthermore, measurements of the ratios of inclusive-jet cross sections using different jet algorithms are presented and compared to pQCD calculations including up to O(\u03b1 3 s ) terms.

Such tests rely on a trustworthy reconstruction of the topology of the final-state partons. This is best done by using jet algorithms with analogous implementation in experiment and theory. On the experimental side, the results of the application of a jet algorithm should not depend significantly on the presence of soft particles or particles which undergo strong decays. On the theoretical side, they should be infrared and collinear safe, so that order-by-order pQCD calculations can be performed. A close correspondence between the jets and the final-state partons, so that hadronisation corrections are small, and suppression of beam-remnant jet contributions, when necessary, are also required.",

Cluster algorithms, such as JADE [26] or k T , are based on successive recombinations of particles. They are usually applied in e + e \u2212 experiments, where the initial state is governed by QED and the final-state hadrons arise uniquely from the short-distance interaction so that all hadrons observed should be associated with the hard process and thus clustered. Cone algorithms, such as the iterative cone algorithm [27], are based on a maximisation of the energy density within a cone of fixed size and are usually applied in hadron collisions, where the initial state consists of coloured partons. The initial parton carries only a fraction of the momentum of the parent hadron, and the spectator partons lead to the presence of remnant jets and the underlying event, which leads to the production of soft hadrons not correlated with the hard interaction. Thus, not all final-state particles would be associated to jets.",

In the ratios, the statistical correlations among the event samples as well as those among the jets in the same event were taken into account in the estimation of the statistical uncertainties. These ratios show that the cross sections with the three jet algorithms are similar: the ratios as functions of Q 2 differ from unity by less than 3.2%; as functions of E jet T,B , they differ by less than 3.6% except at high E jet T,B , where the difference is 10%. The pQCD predictions including up to O(\u03b1 3 s ) terms for the ratios of cross sections are also shown in Figs. 3c and 3d. In the estimation of the total theoretical uncertainty of the predicted ratio, all the theoretical contributions were assumed to be correlated except that due to terms beyond O(\u03b1 3 s ) and that from the modelling of the QCD cascade. The measured ratios are well described by the calculations including up to O(\u03b1 3 s ) terms within the small experimental and theoretical uncertainties, which are dominated by the uncertainty on the modelling of the QCD cascade. Figure 4 shows the contributions to the theoretical uncertainty of the inclusive-jet cross sections from terms beyond NLO, from the uncertainty in the PDFs, from that on the value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) and from that on the modelling of the QCD cascade, separately for the anti-k T and SIScone algorithms. The uncertainty coming from the terms beyond NLO is dominant at low E jet T,B and low Q 2 in all cases and somewhat higher for the predictions based on SIScone than those for the anti-k T and k T [5] algorithms. At high E jet T,B , the PDF uncertainty is dominant in the case of the anti-k T algorithm and of the same order as that arising from terms beyond NLO for the SIScone algorithm. At high Q 2 , the uncertainty due to terms beyond NLO is of the same order for both algorithms and remains dominant. The uncertainty on the modelling of the QCD cascade is somewhat higher for the SIScone algorithm than for anti-k T , but significantly smaller than that from terms beyond NLO. The total theoretical uncertainty for the predictions using \u00b5 R = Q is slightly larger than that using \u00b5 R = E jet T,B . The inclusive-jet cross sections for different regions of Q 2 as a function of E jet T,B are presented in Fig. 5 and Tables 3 and 4 for both algorithms. The measured cross sections exhibit a steep fall-off within the E jet T,B range considered. As Q 2 increases, the E jet T,B dependence of the cross section becomes less steep. The measurements have a similar shape and normalisation for both jet algorithms and are similar to the results obtained with the k T algorithm [4]. The NLO QCD predictions are compared to the measurements in Fig. 5. The data are well described by the predictions. Figure 6 shows the ratios of the measured differential cross sections to the NLO QCD calculations. The uncertainty of the NLO QCD calculations is also shown: the uncertainties from the anti-k T predictions are of a similar size as those encountered for the k T algorithm [4], and those for SIScone are somewhat larger at low E jet T,B and low Q 2 . In summary, it is concluded that the data for the k T , anti-k T and SIScone jet algorithms are well described by the NLO QCD calculations with similar experimental and theoretical precision. Furthermore, the measured ratios are well described by the predictions including up to O(\u03b1 3 s ) terms, demonstrating the ability of the pQCD calculations with up to four partons in the final state to account adequately for the differences between the jet algorithms.",

The overall normalisation uncertainty from the luminosity determination was also considered. The largest contribution to the experimental uncertainty comes from the jet energy scale and amounts to \u00b11.9% on \u03b1 s (M Z ) for both algorithms (\u00b12% for k T [5]). The theoretical uncertainties were evaluated as described in Section 7. The largest contribution was the theoretical uncertainty arising from terms beyond NLO, which was estimated by using the method proposed by Jones et al. [57], and amounted to \u00b11.5% for both algorithms 6 (\u00b11.5% for k T [5]). The uncertainty due to the proton PDFs was \u00b10.7 (\u00b10.8)% for the anti-k T (SIScone) algorithm (\u00b10.7% for k T [5]). The uncertainty arising from the hadronisation effects amounted to \u00b10.9 (\u00b11.2)% for the anti-k T (SIScone) algorithm (\u00b10.8% for k T [5]). Thus, the performance of the three jet algorithms is very similar.",
