It is the heaviest meson that decays through weak interactions, with either the c orb quark decaying or through their weak annihilation [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Although the B + c meson was discovered in 1998 by the CDF collaboration [8,9], relatively few decay channels were observed [10,11] prior to LHCb measurements [12][13][14][15][16].",

The main uncertainty arises from the imperfect knowledge of the shape of the signal and background components used to model the B + c mass distributions. It is estimated using an alternative model to describe the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + mass distributions consisting of a Crystal Ball function [48] for the signal and a linear function for the background. The changes in the yields relative to the default fits are used to determine a 5.0 % uncertainty on the number of signal candidates in both channels, and is dominated by the large background level in signal decay.",
