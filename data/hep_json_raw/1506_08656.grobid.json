The production of correlated jet pairs was quantified using the rate, R R , of \"neighbouring\" jets that accompany \"test\" jets within a given range of angular distance, R, in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle plane. The jets were measured in the ATLAS calorimeter and were reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameters d = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. R R was measured in different Pb+Pb collision centrality bins, characterized by the total transverse energy measured in the forward calorimeters. A centrality dependence of R R is observed for all three jet radii with R R found to be lower in central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The ratios formed by the R R values in different centrality bins and the values in the 40-80% centrality bin are presented.",

            "text": "Experimental studies of jet production in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC can directly reveal the properties of the quark-gluon plasma created in the collisions. One predicted consequence of quark-gluon plasma formation is \"jet quenching\" that refers to the modification of parton showers initiated by hard-scattering processes which take place in the quark-gluon plasma [1]. Measurements of jet pairs at the LHC provided the first direct evidence of jet quenching [2,3]. In those measurements, the enhancement of transverse momentum imbalance of dijets in central Pb+Pb collisions was observed. Measurements at the LHC of inclusive jet suppression [4,5] and the variation of the suppression with jet azimuthal angle with respect to the elliptic flow plane [6] have shown that the transverse energy of jets is significantly degraded and that the energy loss depends on the path length of the parton shower in the plasma. These dijet and single-jet measurements provide complementary information about the jet quenching process. The single jet measurements are sensitive to the average partonic energy-loss while the dijet measurements probe differences in the quenching between the two parton showers traversing the medium. Those differences can arise from the unequal path lengths of the showers in the medium or from fluctuations in the energy loss process itself. E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch.",

Neighbouring jet pairs include jets originating from the same hard interaction, but also jets from different hard interactions. The latter are not of interest in this analysis, and are subtracted statistically. The remaining neighbouring jet pairs result primarily from hard radiation by the parton that occurs early in the process of the shower formation. Generally, two neighbouring jets originating from the same hard scattering should have more similar path lengths in the medium compared to the two jets in the previous dijet measurement. Therefore measuring neighbouring jets could probe differences in their quenching that do not result primarily from difference in path length. More generally, measurements of the correlated production of jets in the same parton shower may provide more detailed insight into the modification of the parton shower in the quark-gluon plasma beyond the subsequent quenching of the resulting jets.",

The inner detector is composed of silicon pixel detectors in the innermost layers, followed by silicon microstrip detectors and a straw-tube tracker, all immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by a solenoid. The calorimeter system consists of a high-granularity liquid argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 3.2, a steel/scintillator sampling hadronic calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 1.7, a LAr hadronic calorimeter covering 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The hadronic calorimeter has three sampling layers longitudinal in shower depth and has a \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 granularity of 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 for |\u03b7| < 2.5 and 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 for 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. 2 The EM calorimeters are segmented into three shower-depth compartments with an additional pre-sampler layer. The forward regions are instrumented with copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr forward calorimeters (FCal) covering 3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, optimized for electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements, respectively. Two minimum-bias trigger scintillators (MBTS) counters are located on each side at 3.56 m along the beamline from the centre of the ATLAS detector. The MBTS detect charged particles in the range 2.1 < |\u03b7| < 3.9. Each MBTS counter is divided into 16 sections, each of which provides measurements of both the pulse heights and arrival times of energy deposits.

The anti-k t algorithm was first run in four-vector recombination mode, on \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 logical towers. The energies in the towers were obtained by summing energies of calorimeter cells, calibrated at a scale set for electron showers, within the tower boundaries. Then, an iterative procedure was used to estimate a calorimeter layer-and \u03b7-dependent underlying event (UE) energy density, while excluding actual jets from that estimate. The UE energy was subtracted from each calorimeter cell within the towers included in the reconstructed jet. The subtraction accounted for a cos 2\u03c6 modulation in the UE energy density due to collective flow [11] of the medium using a measurement of the amplitude and phase of that modulation in the calorimeter. The jet energies and momenta were calculated via a sum of all cells contained within the jets, treating each cell as a massless four-vector, using E T values after the UE subtraction. A correction was applied to the reconstructed jet transverse energies to account for jets not excluded or only partially excluded from the UE estimate. The magnitude of the correction was typically a few percent but can be as large as 10% for jets whose energies are fully included in the UE estimate. Then, a final \u03b7and jet E T -dependent hadronic energy scale calibration factor was applied [4].",

These biases were removed by applying a multiplicative correction factor to background distributions prior to the subtraction. This multiplicative factor was derived from the reconstruction efficiency of two neighbouring jets evaluated as a function of their angular separation in the annulus.

The impact of uncertainties on the jet energy scale, jet energy resolution and jet angular resolution was assessed by constructing new bin-by-bin correction factors with a systematically varied relationship between the reconstructed and truth jet kinematics. The resulting uncertainties on R R and \u03c1 R R were evaluated from their changed values obtained with modified jet energy scale, jet energy resolution and jet angular resolution dependencies. The systematic uncertainty due to the jet energy scale is composed of two parts: an absolute, centrality-independent compo-nent, and a centrality-dependent component. The uncertainty on R R from the jet energy scale uncertainty is evaluated by shifting all reconstructed jet transverse energies by \u00b11 standard deviation of the jet energy scale uncertainty. The absolute component is determined from the in situ studies of the calorimeter response; systematic variations of the jet response in the MC simulation [16]; and from studies of the relative energy scale difference between the jet reconstruction procedure in heavy-ion collisions, and the procedure used for inclusive jet measurements in 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV pp collisions [17]. The magnitude of the uncertainty on the R R from the absolute jet energy scale uncertainty varies from 2% to 15% as a function of E T and radius of the jet. The centralitydependent component of jet energy scale uncertainty [5] was estimated using the PYQUEN MC generator [18].

The systematic uncertainty on the trigger is applicable only for  reconstructed jet \u03b7 and \u03c6 is smeared to reflect a up to \u223c15% centrality and E T dependent uncertainty on the angular resolution. The uncertainty on the jet angular resolution was estimated by comparing the angular distance between track jets and the closest calorimetric jet in the data and in the MC simulation. The magnitude of uncertainty on R R from the jet angular resolution is smaller than 2%. The systematic uncertainty on the jet trigger efficiency covers a possible bias caused by selecting test jets in the region where the jet trigger is not fully efficient. This is the case for the d = 0.4 jets with E test T < 90 GeV reconstructed in the 0-10% and 10-20% centrality bins. For that E T region, the systematic uncertainty was determined as the difference between the trigger efficiencies for inclusive jets and jets that were required to have a neighbouring jet. This trigger efficiency difference is less than 5% and is independent of the E nbr T . To avoid statistical fluctuations in the values of systematic uncertainties, the weak E nbr T dependence of the uncertainties is smoothed by a second-order polynomial. Systematic uncertainties on R R for d = 0.4 jets are summarized in Table 1 for the 0-10% and 40-80% centrality bins. The table shows the maximum values of uncertainties for R R and for \u03c1 R R . The total systematic uncertainties for jets with the other two jet radii are smaller than those shown in the table.

Such a decrease in suppression with increasing E nbr T may in fact be expected. The jet quenching is generally expected to depend on the initial parton energy, but if the splitting happens such that the two partons have similar energy, their quenching would likely be comparable due to similar in-medium path-length travelled by the two partons forming neighbouring jets.

After subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds from different hard-scattering processes, such jet pairs result from the production of multiple jets in the same hardscattering process. As such, it is complementary to previous studies of single-jet suppression and dijet asymmetry. By probing the relative quenching of a pair of correlated jets in different collision centralities, this measurement opens up the possibility to study the role of fluctuations in the jet quenching process. This measurement represents a first, exploratory study of how the quarkgluon plasma influences the production and/or later evolution of the neighbouring jets from the same parton shower in heavy-ion collisions.",

The measurements were performed using jets reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm for jet radii d = 0.2, d = 0.3, and d = 0.4. The production of pairs of correlated jets was quantified using the rate of neighbouring jets that accompany a test jet, R R , evaluated both as a function of test-jet E T and neighbouring-jet E T . A significant dependence of R R on collision centrality is observed in both cases, suggesting a suppression of neighbouring jets which increases with increasing centrality of the collision. The centrality dependence of the suppression was further quantified using the central-to-peripheral ratio of R R distributions, \u03c1 R R . The trends seen in \u03c1 R R evaluated as a function of neighbouring-jet E T indicate a decrease in suppression with increasing neighbouring-jet E T which is, however, of limited significance due to the limited size of the available data sample. The \u03c1 R R evaluated as a function of test-jet E T exhibits a suppression reaching values of 0.5-0.7 in 0-10% central collisions and does not show any strong dependence on E T . This behaviour of the neighbouring jet production can be used to constrain the theoretical models aiming to describe fluctuations in the jet energy loss.",
