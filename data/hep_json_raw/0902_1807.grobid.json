The new, model-independent method of combining the measured cross sections takes full account of correlated systematics in a coherent way, leading to significantly reduced uncertainties in the combined measurement across the (x, Q 2 ) plane. The combined cross section data have been used as the sole input for a new next-to-leading order QCD fit to extract the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The PDFs extracted have greatly reduced experimental uncertainties, compared to separate QCD analyses on data from H1 and ZEUS. Model uncertainties, including those arising from the parameterisation dependence, have also been carefully considered. The resulting HERA PDFs have impressive precision.",

The combination method [1] uses an iterative \u03c7 2 minimisation, which carefully takes into account the correlations within the data that result from different sources of uncertainty. The key assumption is that the measurements from H1 and ZEUS represent a common truth. Thus, forcing them to agree results in a strong constraint which cross-calibrates the measurements, resulting in significantly reduced overall uncertainties. The combined HERA data have subsequently been used as the sole input to a next-to-leading (NLO) QCD fit to determine the proton PDFs. This analysis is also discussed in the present contribution.",

The errors which re-sult from the combination process (centre-of-mass energy correction, additive versus multiplicative error treatment, correlations in the background subtraction and on hadronic energy calibration) were introduced as additional point-to-point correlated systematic sources of uncertainty on the average cross section. Figure 1 shows the complete set of combined e + p NC data, spanning the entire x and Q 2 range. The scaling violations are clearly visible at both low and high x. The data are compared to two previously published QCD fits performed by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations on their own data. As expected, the fits provide an excellent description of the HERA combined data. Figure 2 shows a close up, with a linear y scale, of three selected x bins, as a function of Q 2 . The combined data are compared to the individual measurements from H1 and ZEUS (shifted for clarity). At low Q 2 , where the data are limited by systematic uncertainties, the improvement in the total uncertainty is visible.

Fractional uncertainty bands are shown beneath each plot, with the experimental and model uncertainties being shown separately. The variation of the strange fraction, f s , dominates the model uncertainty on the sea, while variations of Q 2 0 and Q 2 min dominate those on the gluon and valence quarks. Comparison of the results for Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 and Q 2 = 10000 GeV 2 shows that, as Q 2 increases, the PDF uncertainties become impressively small. The summary plots shown in Fig. 5 illustrate that the total uncertainty of the PDFs obtained from the HERA combined data set is much reduced compared to the those of the PDFs extracted from separate analyses of the H1 and ZEUS data sets. The dramatic improvement is a result of the data combination. Figure 6 compares the HERAPDF 0.1 PDFs to those of the CTEQ6.1 [19] and MRST01 [20] global fits 4 . The results indicate that the precision of the HER-APDF0.1 PDFs for the low x sea and gluon is impressive.",
