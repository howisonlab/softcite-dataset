The quantity of interest to us here is the matrix V , called the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1,2], describing how the mass states are mixed in the weak interaction. The standard model does not predict V ; it must be evaluated experimentally. Otherwise, some physics beyond the standard model is necessary to predict V . However, it is not an arbitrary 3 \u00d7 3 complex matrix. In the standard model with 3 generations, it relates two bases, and must be unitrary. Nine real parameters are required to describe an arbitrary 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix. Not all of these parameters are of physical significance, five of them can be absorbed as arbitrary phases in the definition of the quark fields. This leaves four real physical parameters required to completely specify the CKM matrix in the standard model. As only three parameters are sufficient to specify a real orthogonal matrix (i.e., a rotation matrix), the matrix is in general complex. This yields a standard model mechanism for CP violation.",

If any deviation from unitarity is detected, that is evidence for new physics, such as the presence of additional generations. Alternatively, if two measurements, via different processes, of the same element in the standard model yield different results, that is also evidence for new physics. An important class of such searches for new physics is the possibility of new physics at a high energy scale contributing to some processes via new virtual particle exchange, perhaps in semileptonic decays or in \"penguin diagrams\". For example, this could show up in CP asymmetry measurements. Thus, the measurement of V has two thrusts: First, the four parameters are fundamental in the standard model, and must be determined by measurement. Second, measurements of the CKM matrix elements provide a means to search for physics beyond the standard model, or to constrain such theories.",

Radiative corrections are not negligible considering available experimental precision, and there is a large literature on this subject.

The present situation on the lattice calculation of f \u03c0 is reviewed in [19], where a precision of 1.3% is quoted. Thus, while the pion lifetime, \u03c4 \u03c0 = (2.6033 \u00b1 0.0005)10 \u22128 s [3], is precisely known, it measures the combination f 2 \u03c0 |V ud | 2 , and the extraction of |V ud | is hampered by the inability to precisely calculate f \u03c0 .

Including the Particle Data Group scaling factor procedure [3] the uncertainties enlarge with a scale factor of S = 2.2 to (44) and (10), respectively. The |V us | matrix element is also measured in hyperon decays and in tau decays to strangeness (e.g., see Blucher and Marciano in [3] and references therein). The precision and theoretical understanding of these measurements is not competitive with the K 2 and K 3 measurements at this time. In particular, there has been a long-standing discrepancy between |V us | determined from inclusive \u03c4 \u2192 X s \u03bd \u03c4 decays compared with the kaon results. An evaluation in [37], based on sum rule and flavor breaking theoretical work described in [38], yields |V us |(\u03c4 \u2192 X s \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 0.2176 (21), which is 3.3 standard deviations smaller than the K 2 and K 3 average. This value would also imply a 3.6\u03c3 deviation from three generation unitarity when combined with the values for |V ud | 2 and |V ub | 2 in this review. Improvements in the theoretical framework have recently been suggested [39], and a new evaulation of the \u03c4 data yields |V us |(\u03c4 \u2192 X s \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 0.2228 (23) exp (5) thy . This value (which uses some unpublished preliminary data from BaBar on \u03c4 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd [40] that also helps to improve the agreement) is consistent with the kaon determination. The experimental uncertainty dominates, and there is room for the \u03c4 determination of |V us | to improve, e.g., with Belle-II.",

In Table 2 the 818 pb \u22121 dataset from CLEO-c includes the 281 pb \u22121 dataset, and there is some correlation between the tagged and untagged analyses in both statistical and systematic errors. The correlations, including as well those between the charged and neutral D channels, have been derived by CLEO-c on the 281 pb \u22121 dataset [58]. We use the correlation information (including the assumption that all of the 818 pb \u22121 dataset has the same correlation in the systematic errors with the untagged analysis) to obtain an average of the data in Table 2: |V cd |f DK + (0) = 0.7208 (33). The p value for the \u03c7 2 statistic is 0.004. The correlation between the two BESIII results is small, and is neglected.

This and other corrections are potentially important now that the measurements have become precise. However, this determination of |V cs | is limited by the uncertainty in f DK + (0), hence neglect of these corrections is presently safe enough. The smallness of the p value is of some concern. It is possible that we are misestimating the correlations in our treatment of the CLEO data. However, it may also be an indication that the neglect of the different electromagnetic corrections between D + and D 0 is no longer justified. The incorporation of such corrections should be performed as part of the analysis. However, they naively could be as large as O(%) [59]. To investigate the possible effect, \"correcting\" the D 0 numbers by a factor of 0.99 improves the p value to 2%, while changing the average to 0.7194(33); a factor of 0.98 improves it to 5%, while changing the average to 0.7181 (33). As already noted the uncertainty for |V cs | remains dominated by the uncertainty in f DK + (0), so this remains a secondary issue for our discussion. Nevertheless, we suggest that future evaluations of f DK + (0)|V cs | include such corrections in the analysis over the Dalitz plot. To extract |V cs |, the form factor at zero recoil, f DK + (0), is required, and lattice calculations are available. The FLAG evaluation [4] is f DK + (0) = 0.747 \u00b1 0.019. (40) Due to the FLAG quality and publication requirements, this is just the HPQCD evaluation from Ref. [60]. This yields |V cs | = 0.965 (25). The leptonic and semileptonic results are consistent (p(\u03c7 2 ) = 0.24), averaging them yields: (30),",

An evaluation [69] of B \u00b5 for the nominal kinematic regime (visible energy >\u223c 30 GeV) is combined in the 2014 RPP [3] with a measurement from CHORUS (nuclear emulsion) [70] obtaining B \u00b5 = 0.087 (5), and thence |V cd | = 0.230 (11). There is a further result from CHORUS based on events produced in the lead-scintillating fiber calorimeter [71], which has not been included in this average. However, the review in [69] notes the inconsistency in combining leading order (LO) and next-toleading order (NLO) determinations, and quotes separate results. The LO results from CDHS, CCFR, and CHARM II are averaged obtaining |V cd | LO = 0.232 (10), while the NLO result from CCFR yields |V cd | NLO = 0.246 (16).

This is reminiscient of the z-expansion employed for |V cs | (Section 3.3). Expansions about the zero recoil point are used. In the \"CLN\" approach [76] for G(w), an expansion depending on two parameters, G(1) and \"slope\" \u03c1 2 , provides a good approximation. For F (w), two additional parameters, form factor ratios denoted as R 1 (1) and R 2 (1), are needed. These parameters are determined in fits to the data. It may be remarked that the precision in |V cb | has improved to the point that the approximate expansion in [76] may no longer be adequate [84], and use of [81,82,83] preferred. A recent result from Belle [85] obtains \u03b7 EW |V cb | = 40.12(1.34) \u00d7 10 \u22123 using [76] and \u03b7 EW |V cb | = 41.10(1.14) \u00d7 10 \u22123 using [81,82,83] (truncating after z 3 in the expansion).

With slight differences, the Belle result is \u03b7 EW |V cb | = 0.0401 (13), corresponding, with our above value for \u03b7 EW , to |V cb | = 0.0399 (13).

Indeed, experimental results, from BaBar [108], Belle [109,110], and LHCb [111] show some deviation from the standard model.

Both BaBar [116,120] and Belle [119] report measurements in B \u2192 \u03c1 \u03bd and B \u2192 \u03c9 \u03bd. However, more theoretical work is needed to bring these evaluations of |V ub | to the same level as for the \u03c0 \u03bd channel. It has been suggested [121] that the model dependence in B \u2192 \u03c1 \u03bd may be avoided by a model-independent analysis of the \u03c0\u03c0 \u03bd final state, using dispersion theory for the \u03c0\u03c0 form factors. We do not include these measurements in our average. We also note a recent analysis [122] using the branching fractions for the baryonic decay modes B \u2212 \u2192 pp\u03c0 \u2212 andB 0 \u2192 ppD 0 to extract the ratio |V ub /V cb | = 0.088 +0.022 \u22120.016 \u00b1 0.010, where the first error is theoretical and the second is experimental. The decay B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd provides for a measurement of the product |V ub |f B , where f B is the B meson decay constant, according to the appropriately relabeled Eq. 22. The branching fraction for this decay has been measured by BaBar [123,124] and Belle [125,126] and earlier references cited in these. Both experiments provide experiment averages of their hadronic and semileptonic B-tag results. The \"tag\" B refers to the other B in the event, not decaying to \u03c4 \u03bd. Signatures of the tag B are used to reduce background. This may either be through a full or partial reconstruction of the tag B in a hadronic decay mode, or by detecting a semileptonic decay with an identified e or \u00b5. We average the experiments to obtain B(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 1.06(20)\u00d710 \u22124 , with a \u03c7 2 probability for consistency between the experiments of 10%. This translates to |V ub | 2 f 2 B = 60(11) \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV 2 , using Eq. 22 (relabeled), but neglecting the radiative correction term.",

In principle, this can be dealt with by selecting leptons above the endpoint for b \u2192 c transitions. However, this leads to theoretical difficulties with the operator product expansion, and the determination of |V ub | in inclusive semileptonic decays is a story in tradeoffs between the theoretical difficulties near the endpoint and experimental backgrounds far from the endpoint. Several different theoretical calculations of the inclusive partial decay rate in QCD have been proposed, most labeled by authors' initials: ADFR [128,129,130], BLL [131], BLNP [132,133,134], DGE (\"dressed-gluon exponentiation\") [135], and GGOU [136]. Reviews of the experimental and theoretical issues may be found in [9], Kowalewski and Mannel in [3], and [7]. The HFAG compilation [6,7] considers data from BaBar [137,138,117], Belle [139,140,141,142], and CLEO [143]. BaBar [117] and Belle [142] have published results on their entire datasets with a large portion of the phase space included; these results provide for the smallest theoretical uncertainties. With one exception, all of the measurements have been compiled by HFAG under the four schemes, ADFR, BLNP, DGE, and GGOU. We present the 2014 updated averages for |V ub | under these schemes in the middle column of Table 5.",

The value for |V tb | is extracted by comparing with the theoretical cross section (for |V tb | = 1):",

A measurement, with large uncertainty, of the s-channel cross section at 8 TeV has been reported however [154]. The LHC results for the t-channel and W t associated production are shown in Table 6. We exclude the unpublished results from our average. Averaging the ATLAS and CMS 7 GeV cross sections is complicated by the presence of correlations, as is the combination of the results for |V tb | at different energies and for different channels. Since the cross sections for different processes and different energies cannot be usefully averaged, we work with |V tb | 2 . This introduces an additional correlation through the theoretical cross section. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have begun to consider correlations in averaging the results of the two experiments [155]. The correlation coefficient at 8 TeV for the t channel is estimated to be \u03c1 = 0.38. We will assume this holds also at 7 TeV. We'll further assume this correlation for the W t channel between the two experiments; the uncertainties are here much larger, so an error in this assumption will not have much effect on our final average. We note that the correlated uncertainty from the top quark mass is perhaps being treated inconsistently in our average, but this has a small effect on the result.",

With this information, we deduce a correlation in the experimental uncertainties in |V tb | 2 of about 40% between the 7 and 8 TeV t-channel results. We will assume the same correlation for the W t production; the uncertainties are here much larger, so an error made will not have much effect on our final average.

If V is not unitary, e.g., if it is a submatrix of a higher dimension unitary matrix, then there may be additional phases. It is thus a test of the standard model whether one complex phase is sufficient to describe all CP violating phenomena in the quark sector. Our discussion of the magnitudes of the CKM elements has avoided assumptions about the 3 \u00d7 3 unitarity of the matrix. In principle, it would be appropriate to take the corresponding approach and report the measurements of the relative phases of each of the matrix elements. However, the available information remains incomplete, and it is also not so convenient to express measured quantities in this form. Instead, it is convenient and conventional to couch much of the discussion in terms of the 3 \u00d7 3 unitary parameterization in Eqs. 8 and 14. Deviations from 3 \u00d7 3 unitarity may then show up as internal inconsistencies. Theoretical reviews of the material in this section may be found in, for example, [170,183,184,185].",

The weak interaction provides for \u2206B = 2 transitions as shown already in the box diagrams in Fig. 4. The dispersive part, M 12 , is computed from the |\u2206B| = 2 Hamiltonian. However, there is no absorptive contribution from this operator, and determining \u0393 12 involves a second order \u2206B = 1 calculation [203]. The prediction is that |\u0393 12 | |M 12 | (|\u0393 12 /M 12 | \u223c O(0.005) for both B d and B s , e.g., [204]). Referring to Eq. 92 we thus expect that |q/p| \u2248 1. In this limit, the mass eigenstates are also CP eigenstates, and there is no CP violation in mixing in the B 0 system, in contrast with CP violation in mixing being an important contribution to CP violation in the neutral kaon system (Eqs. 68,69). Experimental measurements of |q/p| \u2248 1 in the B d system bear this out. Reference [9] (see also [205]) gives a B-factory average of |q/p| \u2212 1 = 0.3(2.8) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , from measurements of CP asymmetries in both semileptonic and hadronic B decays. LHCb [206] obtains a consistent precise result from the semileptonic asymmetry, |q/p| \u2212 1 = \u22120.1(9)(1.5) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Using semileptonic decays with D s instead of D, LHCb [207] obtains a corresponding result for the B s system: |q/p| s \u2212 1 = \u22120.6(5.0)(3.6) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . It should be remarked that a measurement by D0 [208], including both B and B s contributions, obtained a result for the dilepton asymmetry differing from the standard model by 3.6 standard deviations.",

Second, since \u0393 12 and M 12 are, to lowest order, proportional to \u03bb 4 for the B s system and to \u03bb 6 for the B d system, we expect both the mixing frequency (as in Section 3.8) and the width difference to be of order 1/\u03bb 2 larger in the B s system.

In method (i), however, t = 0 is determined by the vertex of the tagging B decay. This decay could happen before or after the decay of the \"signal\" B. Thus, the signal decay time t could equally probably be positive or negative. In quantum mechanics, the wave function may be propagated forward or backward in time, so both signs of t have equal utility. It has the consequence, however, that if we imagine doing an experiment where we don't measure the time, then the coefficient of the sin \u2206mt term in Eq. 100 is inaccessible. We must measure the time, or at least its sign, to measure this coefficient. In any event, the most precise measurements of the coefficients of cos \u2206mt and sin \u2206mt are obtained using time information.",

The b \u2192 ccs process, Fig. 5, with the final state, f , a CP eigenstate admits a clean theoretical treatment, as well as being practical experimentally. A B 0 can decay to a CP eigenstate of charmonium and a K 0 S or a K 0 L CP eigenstate providing an overall final eigenstate of CP . The decay can happen in tree-level B 0 \u2192 f decays and via the mixing B 0 \u2192B 0 \u2192 f , providing two interfering amplitudes. This can be done for both initial B 0 andB 0 states and the results compared. For an explicit, and important, example, consider the measurement of CP violation in B \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S . The final state is here a CP eigenstate, with \u03b7 J/\u03c8K S = \u22121, neglecting the small CP violation in mixing in the K 0 system.

An important question is whether other diagrams exist for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S and related decays, in particular standard model penguin processes, such as Fig. 5b (though for the present purposes the term is broadened beyond particular diagrams). Such processes could pollute the sin 2\u03b2 measurement with additional phases. While such contributions are expected to be small (an early estimate [222] implies a penguin amplitude less than 1% of the tree amplitude for B \u2192 J/\u03c8K S ), the measurement precision is steadily improving, and this is a subject of ongoing investigation. A traditional approach to checking possible penguin pollution has been to look at SU (3)-related decays in which the penguin diagrams are not so strongly Cabibbo suppressed, such as B s \u2192 J/\u03c8K S , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 , and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8(K + , \u03c0 + ), as discussed, e.g., in [223,224,225,226,227]. The results of reference [227] favor larger values of \u03b2 (and the inclusive value for |V ub |), although remaining consistent at the 1-2\u03c3 level. Another approach is to avoid SU (3) symmetry arguments and perform standard model calculations, for example [228,229]. The recent calculation in [229] conservatively evaluates a maximum penguin effect of \u00b10.34 \u2022 on \u03b2 in the J/\u03c8K S mode, with somewhat larger potential effects in other modes. An alternative strategy for measuring penguin effects has been proposed [230] using a generalization of the method used by BaBar to demonstrate T violation [231].",

Instead, \u03b3 is accessible in interference between various pairs of tree-level diagrams. This does not imply an easy measurement, unfortunately, and \u03b3 remains the most poorly measured of the three unitarity triangle angles, in spite of many possible channels that have been proposed. There are three general approaches to the measurement of \u03b3, each with its own trade-offs. The basic idea is to use the interference between b \u2192 c\u016bs and b \u2192cus processes leading to the same final state f [265,266,267]. For example, consider the decays B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192D 0 K \u2212 where the D 0 and D 0 are observed in a common final state. Thus, we have two interfering amplitudes.

Experimental measurements have been performed by BaBar [293] using partial reconstruction of B \u2192 D * \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decays [294], with full reconstruction of B \u2192 D ( * )\u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 and B \u2192 D \u2213 \u03c1 \u00b1 decays and similarly from Belle [295] (partial reconstruction), [296] (full and partial reconstruction).

The difference between the approximate calculation and the true value is a theoretical error. We should remark that distinctions are usually made between theoretical uncertainties that have a statistical basis, such as sampling statistics in lattice computations, and systematic uncertainties, such as neglect of higher orders.

In this construction, say for a 1 \u2212 \u03b1 = 68% confidence interval, we consider the \u03c7 2 test at the \u03b1 significance level. The critical value \u03c7 2 crit for such a test is give by solving for it in Prob(\u03c7 2 \u2265 \u03c7 2 crit |H 0 ) = \u03b1, where the null hypothesis is the model in which the parameter resides (e.g., the standard model).

The SCAN method intervals tend to be larger than the CKMfitter intervals. This is probably due to a fluctuation towards consistency with the standard model, the p value is 0.76, hence the inverted test acceptance region intervals will tend to be large. Table 9 provides a summary of what we consider to be the present status of measurements of the CKM quantities as reviewed herein.

With the exclusive measurements, the data is consistent with the standard model 3 \u00d7 3 unitarity (even given the questionable treatment of theoretical uncertainties). On the other hand, the inclusive measurements result in a low p value for consistency, less than 2%. However, as discussed above, the treatment of the theoretical uncertainties is an issue in the interpretation of this. If the theoretical uncertainties are to be treated as ranges of allowed values, as in the CKMfitter and SCAN method approaches, somewhat larger p values can be achieved. Even so, the inclusive determination of |V ub | 2 and |V cb | 2 is disfavored. Because 2% (or a few percent, allowing for the theoretical errors) is not extremely unlikely, we cannot make a strong statement. We have already remarked in Section 3.5 that explaining the discrepancy in terms of new physics is difficult. Thus, unless new physics is affecting other measurements in a somewhat perverse way, we conclude that the presently somewhat favored scenario is that there is a problem with the inclusive determinations of |V ub | 2 and |V cb | 2 . The CP -violation phase of Eq. 6 is approximately 70 \u2022 , i.e., not far below the maximal CP -violating 90 \u2022 . However, another way to look at the amount of CP violation is the Jarlskog invariant. In the parameterization of Eq. 6, striking out the second row and column and using Eq. 9 we evaluate J = c 12 s 12 c 2 13 s 13 c 23 s 23 sin \u03b4.",

The normalized residuals are summarized in Table 12 for the fits using the exclusive measurements of |V ub | 2 and |V cb | 2 . There are no obvious difficulties seen in these residuals. For the most part, adding the phase measurements doesn't move the residuals for the magnitudes by very much. The experimental and theoretical effort to understand the CKM matrix has been vast, reflecting its fundamental status in the standard model and as a potential window into physics beyond. The precision of the measurements and theoretical input continues to advance. Here, we have taken a snapshot of the experimental information measuring the CKM matrix. There are some issues, such as the disagreement between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V ub | 2 and |V cb | 2 . However, the general picture of V as a 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix remains a remarkable achievement. Table 12: Normalized residuals of measurements related to the CKM matrix.
