The cross section is measured for Q 2 up to 30 GeV 2 , where Q 2 is the negative of the invariant mass squared of the tagged photon, in the kinematic range 0.5 GeV < W < 2.1 GeV and | cos \u03b8 * | < 1.0 for the total energy and pion scattering angle, respectively, in the \u03b3 * \u03b3 center-of-mass system. The results are based on a data sample of 759 fb \u22121 collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. The transition form factor of the f0(980) and that of the f2(1270) with the helicity-0, -1, and -2 components separately are measured for the first time and are compared with theoretical calculations.",

            "text": "Single-tag two-photon production of a C-even hadronic system (M), \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 M, is an important reaction to investigate the nature of strong interactions in the low energy region, where perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) cannot be applied. It also provides valuable information on the Q 2 dependence of the transition form factor (TFF), where Q 2 is the negative of the invariant mass squared of the tagged photon. This reaction can be studied through the process of e + e \u2212 \u2192 e \u00b1 (e \u2213 )M, where (e \u2213 ) indicates an undetected electron or positron, and results of the measurement can be directly compared to QCD-based theoretical predictions. Diehl, Gousset and Pire considered this process at large Q 2 and small W (< 1 GeV) in terms of constituent-hard scattering and generalized distribution amplitudes and predicted a sizable cross section at LEP and B factories [1]; it is indeed the case at a B factory as reported here. Based on this framework, Braun and Kivel pointed out that the measurement of the TFF of the f 2 (1270) will be useful to cleanly determine a gluon admixture in tensor mesons at large enough Q 2 [2]. In addition, a data-driven dispersive approach was suggested recently [3], allowing a more precise estimate of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (g \u2212 2).",

The predicted Q 2 dependence of TFFs for mesons with J P C = 0 ++ and 2 ++ is summarized in Table I, where the \u03b3 * \u03b3 center-of-mass (c.m.) energy W is replaced by the resonance mass M and \u03bb represents the total helicity of the two incident photons. Note that the helicity-1 (\u03bb = 1) state is allowed when a photon is off the mass shell. According to Table I, TFFs for the helicity-0 and -1 components of a tensor meson grow with Q 2 , a prediction which is amenable to investigation.  [4].

In one sum rule, the integrand has contributions from pseudoscalar mesons and tensor mesons. In the other, axial-vector mesons and tensor mesons contribute to its integrand. The first (second) sum rule gives the helicity-2 TFF of the f 2 (1270) in terms of TFF information of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 (f 1 (1285) and f 1 (1420)).

The z axis of the detector and the solenoid is along the positron beam direction, with the positron beam pointing in the \u2212z direction. The electron-beam direction at the collision point is 22 mrad from the z axis. The CDC measures the longitudinal and transverse momentum components, i.e., along the z axis and in the r\u03d5 plane perpendicular to the beam, respectively. Track trajectory coordinates near the collision point are provided by a silicon vertex detector. Photon detection and energy measurements are performed with a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) by clustering of the energy deposits in the crystals of the electromagnetic shower from an energetic photon, where a possible connection of a charged track to the cluster is examined by extrapolating the track trajectory. Electron identification (ID) is based on E/p, the ratio of the calorimeter energy to the track momentum.",

In this configuration, the correction factor 1 + \u03b4 to the tree-level cross section is close to unity [23]. Most of the events with large r k , typically r k > 0.1, are rejected by the selection criterion that uses E ratio (the definition and criterion being described in Sec. IV A) by requiring energy-momentum conservation between the initial-and final-state particle systems without radiation. This effect is accounted for as a loss of efficiency for events with r k \u2264 r max k . We generate events with a virtuality of the taggedside photon Q 2 1 distributed with a constant form factor over its continuous range Q 2 > 3.0 GeV 2 . The Q 2 value of each event is modified by ISR. We use the momentum of the ISR photon to determine the true Q 2 value in signal-MC events and to study the Q 2 dependence of the detection efficiency. We correct the experimental Q 2 dependence for the ISR effect using factors obtained from the signal MC (see Sec. VI D).

A fake \u03c0 0 is wrongly reconstructed from the beam background or electronic noise. If such a background \u03c0 0 had large reconstructed energy, the event would have been rejected by the p t -balance selection criterion. Therefore, these fake pions remain in the signal event sample only if the noise has small reconstructed energy. In addition, such noise photons populate the lowest energy region just above the energy thresholds for a photon or a neutral pion for the selection. Consequently, the c.m. scattering angle in the two-photon system tends to be reconstructed in the forward regions because of the unbalanced laboratory energies between the two pions and the Lorentz boost of the two-pion system along the beam axis, just as expected in the single-\u03c0 0 production case. However, as seen in Fig. 10(a), no visible enhancement is seen even in the most forward region | cos \u03b8 * | > 0.9, where the number of the signal events is small according to the small signal acceptance (Fig. 10(b)) in the angular distribution for the entire experimental signal candidates.

The majority of such background events populate the small E ratio region, e.g., less than 0.7. This feature is distinct from the aforementioned background processes that can populate the region near E ratio = 1. These backgrounds also do not peak near |\u03a3p * t | = 0. From Fig. 4, we expect that the low-E ratio component could leak into the signal region. We estimate the relative ratio of the non-exclusive backgrounds to the signal yield by counting the number of events in the subregion of the signal region (0.85 < E ratio < 0.925 \u2229 0.1 GeV/c < |\u03a3p * t | < 0.2 GeV/c) where the background component would be relatively large. We assume that the backgrounds are distributed as a linear function in 0 < |\u03a3p * t | < 0.2 GeV/c and in 0.85 < E ratio < 1, vanishing at |\u03a3p * t | = 0 and E ratio = 1, respectively, factorized for the two directions. The fraction of the backgrounds falling in the above subregion is calculated to be 9/16 of that in the entire signal region, according to the distribution.

We find that the \u03d5 * dependence of the differential cross section, and thus the correction-factor value, change drastically between above and below | cos \u03b8 * | = 0.6 and that the value for each of | cos \u03b8 * | < 0.6 and | cos \u03b8 * | > 0.6 is almost constant for the cells with the same (W , Q 2 ). Thus, we take a weighted average of the correction factor for the three (two) bins of | cos \u03b8 * | < 0.6 (| cos \u03b8 * | > 0.6), in order to reduce the uncertainty of the correction. The obtained efficiency correction factor \u03b5/\u03b5 \u2032 , as well as the fit results for a and b, are plotted in Fig. 21.

Thus, in addition to the r 1 fit, we perform fits assuming either D 0 = 0 with D 1 = 0 (denoted as the D 0 fit) or D 1 = 0 with D 0 = 0 (denoted as the D 1 fit). In each category, we put either B D2 = 0 or B D2 = 0. In the D 1 fit, the evaluation of \u01eb 0 is necessary. It turns out that it has little dependence on W and cos \u03b8 * and we use the values listed in Table V for Q 2 bins from 3.5 to 25.0 GeV 2 . We also use the average Q 2 value given in Table IV in each Q 2 bin in the fitting. The r 1 fit with B D2 = 0 (also with B D2 = 0) gives a unique solution as summarized in Table X. In the D 0 fit, two solutions each are obtained for both B D2 = 0 and B D2 = 0 as also summarized in Table X. In the D 1 fit with B D2 = 0, no solutions are obtained, i.e., all solutions have one or more powers beyond the limit. Also, in the D 1 fit with B D2 = 0, two solutions were found with \u03c7 2 P,min /ndf = 719.7/504, which is much worse compared to that of the D 0 fit.",

The normalization uncertainty n in each bin of | cos \u03b8 * |, W , and Q 2 varies between 0.104 and 0.253; the systematic uncertainty from this source is estimated by multiplying the cross section by the factor 1 \u00b1 n. The systematic uncertainties from distortion are estimated in each bin by multiplying the cross section: in W by the factor 1 \u00b1 0.10(W \u2212 1.1 GeV) (\u00b14% distortion in the full range) and in | cos \u03b8 * | by the fac- GeV. The parameterization of the background B i is changed to W/(1.1 \u00b1 0.2) GeV or to Q 2 /(1.0 \u00b1 0.5) GeV 2 . We also set B 1 = 0 to study its effect. The properties of the f 0 (980) and f 2 (1270) are changed using the world-average values [34]. Also r R in the f 2 (1270) parameterization is varied by its error. We have also taken into account the uncertainty of r 1 (Q 2 av ) obtained in the \u03d5 * -dependent analysis, which is evaluated by setting the distortion of \u00b14% in \u03d5 * . The estimated systematic uncertainty of r 1 (Q 2 av ) is much smaller than the statistical uncertainties obtained in the fit. Thus, we set r 1 (Q The obtained Q 2 dependence of TFF for the f 2 (1270) for the r 1 nominal fit is shown in Fig. 34 for the helicity-2 component. Also shown are the predicted Q 2 dependence by Ref. [4] and those from Ref. [5] (Eqs. (1) and (2)). The theoretical prediction of Ref. [4] and of Eq. (2) in Ref. [5] agree well with data. Figure 35 (36) shows the helicity-0 (helicity-1) TFF obtained for the f 2 (1270) together with the prediction [4]. Note that the helicity-1 TFF is calculated from r 1 (Q 2 )F f 2 (Q 2 ), where r 1 (Q 2 ) is given by Eq. (43). The measured value calculated from r 0 at Q 2 = 0, r 0 (0) = (3.56 +0.22 \u22120.27 +12.81 \u22122.74 )% [28], is also plotted in Fig. 35, while Ref. [4] predicts zero at Q 2 = 0 (Table I). The first and second errors of r 0 (0) are statistical and systematic, respectively. The prediction is a factor of 1.5 \u2212 2 larger than the measured values. Figure 37 shows the obtained Q 2 dependence of the TFF of the f 0 (980) for the r 1 nominal fit. Here, the theoretical prediction for a scalar TFF in Ref.

In a 3 \u2022 cone around the track, we collect all photons in the range 0.1 GeV< E \u03b3 < p e c/3, where p e is the measured absolute momentum of the electron track. The absolute momentum of the electron is replaced by p e + \u03a3E \u03b3 . The cosine of the polar angle for the electron (\u03b8 e ) must be within the range \u22120.6235 < cos \u03b8 e < 0.9481, which is the sensitive region for the HiE and Clst4 triggers.We search for a \u03c0 0 candidate reconstructed from a photon pair with each photon having an energy above 0.1 GeV and a polar angle in the range \u22120.6235 < cos \u03b8 \u03b3 < 0.9481. We constrain the polar angle of the photons from at least one \u03c0 0 in the sensitive region of the ECL triggers by the latter condition, in order to reduce the systematic uncertainty of the trigger efficiency. The two-photon invariant mass is required to satisfy the criterion 0.115 GeV/c 2 < M \u03b3\u03b3 < 0.150 GeV/c 2 . This \u03c0 0 candidate is referred to as \"\u03c01\".In parallel, we search for \u03c0 0 candidates with the \u03c0 0 -mass-constrained fit among all pairwise combinations of photons in the entire ECL region. We select only combinations of photon pairs whose goodness of fit satisfies \u03c7 2 < 16. If \u03c01 is also selected by the mass-constrained fit, we replace the four-momentum of \u03c01 by that of the result of the fit.We require that only one more pion be found among the \u03c0 0 candidates from the mass-constrained fit which does not share any photons with \u03c01. We refer to the second \u03c0 0 as \"\u03c02\".If there are two or more possible assignments of \u03c01 and \u03c02, we choose the one with the highest-energy photon to construct \u03c01. If there are still two or more combinations that share the highest-energy photon in \u03c01, we choose the one in which the other photon in \u03c01 has the higher energy.Figure 3shows the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant-mass distribution when constructing \u03c01 with a looser criterion of the two-photon invariant mass. The experimental data are compared with the distribution from the signal-MC sample using fits described below. The signal-MC distribution is fitted by the sum of a Crystal Ball function[25] and a linear function (signal component). Then, the experimental distribution is fitted by the sum of the signal component with the determined shape parameters and an additional linear function (background component), where the normalization and horizontal position for the signal component are allowed to float (resulting in a shift of the peak position by \u22120.8 MeV/c 2 ). The sole purpose of this fit is to compare the figures, which indicates a reasonable agreement and provides an estimate of the background contamination.",
