In addition, a study of these decays provides insight into strong interactions at low-energy scales. The hypothesis that \u03b7 and \u03b7 mesons contain gluonic and intrinsic cc components has long been used to explain experimental results, including the recent observations of large branching fractions for some decay processes of J/\u03c8 and B mesons into pseudoscalar mesons [1,2].",

These decays proceed via formation of a \u03b7 ( ) state from dd (for B 0 mesons) and ss (for B 0 s mesons) quark pairs (see figure 1). The physical \u03b7 ( ) states are described in terms of isospin singlet states |\u03b7 q = 1 \u221a 2 |uu + |dd and |\u03b7 s = |ss , the glueball state |gg , and two mixing angles \u03d5 P and \u03d5 G [5][6][7], The contribution of the |gg state to the physical \u03b7 state is expected to be highly suppressed [8][9][10][11][12], and is therefore omitted from eq. (1.1a). The mixing angles can be related to the B 0 (s) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7 ( ) decay rates [3], where",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [38]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of a scintillating-pad detector (SPD), preshower detectors (PS), an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [39]. This analysis uses events collected by triggers that select the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair from the \u03c8 decay with high efficiency. At the hardware stage a muon with p T > 1.5 GeV/c or a pair of muons is required to trigger the event. For dimuon candidates, the product of the p T of muon candidates is required to satisfy \u221a p T1 p T2 > 1.3 GeV/c and \u221a p T1 p T2 > 1.6 GeV/c for data collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. At the subsequent software trigger stage, two muons are selected with an invariant mass in excess of 2.97 GeV/c 2 and consistent with originating from a common vertex. The common vertex is required to be significantly displaced (3\u03c3) from the pp collision vertices.",

The B 0 (s) \u2192 \u03c8\u03b7 signal yields are estimated by unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fits, using the model described in section 4. Studies of the simulation indicate the presence of an additional background due to feeddown from the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c8K * 0 , followed by the K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay. The charged kaon is misidentified as a pion and combined with another charged pion and a random photon to form an \u03b7 candidate. This background contribution is modelled in the fit using a probability density function obtained from simulation. The fit results are summarised in table 3. For both final states, the positions of the signal peaks are consistent with the known B 0 s mass [51] and the mass resolutions agrees with those of the simulation. The statistical significances of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03b7 and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7 signals are determined by a simplified simulation study, as described in section 4.

The resulting relative difference is less than 0.2% and is therefore neglected. The trigger is highly efficient in selecting B 0 (s) meson decays with two muons in the final state. For this analysis the dimuon pair is required to be compatible with triggering the event. The trigger efficiency for events with \u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 produced in beauty hadron decays is studied in data. A systematic uncertainty of 1.1% is assigned based on the comparison of the ratio of trigger efficiencies for samples of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K + decays in data and simulation [61]. The final systematic uncertainty originates from the dependence of the geometric acceptance on the beam crossing angle and the position of the luminosity region. The observed channel-dependent 0.8%-1.5% differences are taken as systematic uncertainties. The effect of the exclusion of photons that potentially originate from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidates is studied by comparing the efficiencies between data and simulation. The difference is found to be negligible. The total uncertainties in table 5 are obtained by adding the individual independent uncertainties in quadrature.",
