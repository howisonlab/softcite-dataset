            "text": "The top quark, discovered by the CDF and D0 experiments in 1995 [1,2], is the heaviest of all elementary particles in the standard model (SM), with a mass of 173.2 \u00b1 0.9 GeV [3]. The production of top quarkantiquark pairs (tt) at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider is dominated by the quark-antiquark (qq) annihilation process. The measurement of tt differential production cross sections provides a direct test of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions. Moreover, a precise modeling of QCD processes is vital in many searches for contributions from new phenomena, where differential top quark cross sections can be used to set constraints on new sources of physics. A detailed understanding of top quark production is also needed for measurements or searches where new particles decay to a tt pair, where other particles are produced in association with a tt pair, or where tt production is among the dominant backgrounds. An example of the importance of accurate modeling of QCD is given by the deviation observed in the charge asymmetry measurement in pp \u2192 tt production from SM predictions [4][5][6][7].

Differential cross sections, most notably the one as a function of the invariant mass of the tt pair d\u03c3/dm(tt), provide stringent constraints on axigluon models [10]. Differential tt production cross sections have been previously measured both at the Tevatron [10,11] and the LHC [12,13]. The earlier measurements of differential tt production at the Tevatron as a function of the transverse momentum of the t andt quark (p top T ) [11], and as a function of m(tt) [10], showed good agreement with perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading (NLO), as well as next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [14]. Compared to the previous D0 result [11], the current measurement employs a factor of ten more data allowing for higher precision tests of pQCD.",

A silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) [32,33] and central fiber tracker surround the interaction region for pseudorapidities 2 |\u03b7| < 3 and |\u03b7| < 2.5, respectively. These elements of the central tracking system are located within a superconducting solenoidal magnet generating a 1.9 T field, providing measurements for reconstructing event vertices and trajectories of charged particles. The SMT allows for a precision of 40 \u00b5m or better for the reconstructed primary pp interaction vertex (PV) in the plane transverse to the beam direction. The impact parameter of typical charged particle trajectories relative to the PV is determined with a precision between 20 and 50 \u00b5m depending on the number of SMT hits and particle momenta. The impact parameter and its measurement uncertainty are key components of lifetimebased identification of jets containing b quarks [34]. Particle energies are measured using a liquid argon sampling calorimeter that is segmented into a central calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 1.1, and two end calorimeters extending the coverage to |\u03b7| = 4.2. Outside of the calorimetry, trajectories of muons are measured using three layers of tracking detectors and scintillation trigger counters, and an iron toroidal magnet generating a 1.8 T field between the first two layers. Plastic scintillator arrays are located in front of the end-calorimeter cryostats to measure the luminosity [35].",

The measurement of E T is based on calorimetry. In addition, leptons are required to originate from the PV by demanding |\u2206z(\u2113, PV)| < 1 cm. A distance \u2206R = \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c6 2 between a lepton and a jet of \u2206R(\u2113, closest jet) > 0.5 is required to ensure that leptons are isolated [36,37]. For the \u00b5+jets sample upper limits on the transverse mass of the reconstructed W boson of M W T < 250 GeV and E T < 250 GeV are applied to remove events in data with misreconstructed muon p T . To further remove such events, we employ an additional requirement on the significance of the track curvature S c , which is defined as the ratio of the curvature, \u03ba, and the expected uncertainty on \u03ba measured for the track associated with the muon. We employ two selection requirements with different slopes in the azimuthal (\u2206\u03c6) vs. S c plane: Figure 1(a) shows these requirements indicated by the solid lines in the |S c | versus \u2206\u03c6(\u00b5, E T ) plane for tt events and (b) for W +jets background events. The cut on S c removes low momentum muons misreconstructed at high momenta whilst keeping 97% of the leptons stemming from tt decays. A minimum separation in azimuth of \u2206\u03c6(\u2113, E T ) > 0.5 is imposed between the direction of the lepton and the direction of the missing momentum, to reduce multijet background caused by the misidentification of a jet as a lepton and the consequent impact on the accompanying E T . Further reduction of the multijet background is achieved by requiring an additional minimum separation in azimuth between the isolated lepton and E T :",

Instrumental background is due to multijet processes where a jet is misidentified as an electron in the e+jets channel, or with a muon originating from the semileptonic decay of a heavy hadron appears to be isolated in the \u00b5+jets channel. Data-driven [39,40] and MC simulation methods are employed to model the instrumental background. The irreducible background processes are estimated using MC simulations described in Sec. II. Most of this background arises from W +jets production, and to constrain it we use the \u2113 + 2 jets and \u2113 + 3 jets data (dominated by W +jets production) in addition to the \u2113+ \u2265 4 jets sample (dominated by tt production). We determine the sample composition from a simultaneous fit for the tt cross section and the heavy-flavor contribution originating from W +jets. The fit is made to the MVD b identification output distribution; Fig. 2 shows the distribution after applying the fit results for the \u2113 + 2 jets, \u2113 + 3 jets and \u2113+ \u2265 4 jets data sample in the (a) e+jets and (b) \u00b5+jets decay channel. The simultaneous fit yields a W +jets heavy-flavor scale factor s WHF fit = 0.89 \u00b1 0.08 to be applied to the W bb + jets and W cc + jets contributions in addition to the factors discussed in Sec. II. Similar procedures were used in previous measurements by D0 [40]. The simultaneous fit to the \u2113 + 2 jets, \u2113 + 3 jets and \u2113+ \u2265 4 jets samples yields a tt cross section of \u03c3 tt fit = 8.00 \u00b1 0.40 (stat.) pb. We verified that there is no need for an additional scale factor to accommodate the Z/\u03b3 * +jets heavy-flavor contributions s ZHF fit by using a modified version of the simultaneous fit taking into account s ZHF fit instead of s WHF fit . The \u03c3 tt fit serves as an initial value of the tt cross section in the tt differential cross section measurement using inclusive four-jet data.",

            "text": "Measurements involving top quarks benefit from the very short lifetime of the t quark, since it decays before it can hadronize. Effects of hadronization and QCD corrections are thus reduced. Moreover, at Tevatron energies the transverse momentum of tt pairs is almost always smaller than m(tt) and production is central, so that almost the entire phase space of tt production is within the detector acceptance. Corrections to measured quantities as well as their uncertainties are therefore small, leading to well measured top-quark cross sections. The differential cross-sections are defined for partonlevel top quarks including off-shell effects and are corrected for detector and QCD effects using a regularized matrix unfolding procedure [41,42]. This procedure reduces the influence of model dependencies in the cross section determination and introduces correlations among the bins used in the measurement. These correlations are minimized by regularization. Unfolding event migrations relies on a migration matrix (A), which describes the relation between the generated distribution of a vari-able ( x gen ) and its reconstructed distribution ( y rec ) as A x gen = y rec . Each matrix element A ij is the probability for an event originating from bin j of x gen to be measured in bin i of y rec . The migration matrix is based on the simulation of the D0 detector. The reconstruction-level bins used in the migration matrix are twice as narrow as the generator level bins, in order to provide detailed information on the bin-to-bin migrations, and improve the accuracy of the unfolding [43]. The generated distribution x gen can be estimated using A \u2020 , the pseudoinverse [44] of the matrix A: x gen = A \u2020 y rec . As with ordinary matrix inversion, this results in large contributions that lack statistical significance. Such contributions can be minimized by imposing regularization, which leads to an effective cutoff of the insignificant terms. We employ regularized unfolding as implemented in the tunfold package [45]. The regularization is based on the derivative of the distribution and is done in twice as many bins as are used in the final results. An insufficient regularization admits fluctuations into the unfolded result, whereas excessive regularization overly biases the measurement towards the MC generated distribution. The value of the regularization strength is determined using the so-called L-curve approach [45] that balances the consistency of the unfolded data x with the initial data y against the scatter of x. The scatter of x can be caused by fluctuations in cases in which an insufficient regularization is chosen. A \u03c7 2 statistic measures the tension between x, the data and the scatter of x. Within the earlier mentioned bounds, a systematic uncertainty is derived for this procedure as discussed in Sect. IX E. The statistical uncertainties of the differential measurements are computed analytically with tunfold and verified using an ensemble of simulated pseudo-datasets. The covariance matrix is calculated by propagating the uncertainties of the reconstructed distribution y rec through the unfolding process.",

As described in Sec. V, the heavy-flavor scale factor in W +jets and the assumed tt cross section are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the MVD distribution in the \u2113 + 2 jets, \u2113 + 3 jets and \u2113+ \u2265 4 jets samples. From the fit we derive a systematic uncertainty of 8% on the normalization of the W cc + jets and W bb+jets processes, and 5% on the normalization of the tt processes. The uncertainty on the single top quark cross sections is 12.6%, taken from varying the scale by factors of 2 and 0.5. An uncertainty of 7% on the diboson cross sections is assigned to the NLO predictions based on scale variation and PDF uncertainties. The uncertainties on the data-driven method of estimating multijet (MJ) background and its kinematic dependencies, mostly due to the uncertainties on the selection rates of true and false lepton candidates, are 75% in the \u00b5+jets and 32% in the e+jets sample. These uncertainties are estimated by varying the contribution of W cc + jets, W bb + jets, Zcc + jets and Zbb + jets by \u00b120%, the tt contribution by \u00b110%, comparing the fake and true signal rates in different variables (quoting the largest difference as additional parametrization uncertainty). In addition, to estimate the contribution of the fake rate uncertainty, a different E T cut of < 15 GeV (standard cut for the fake rate estimation is < 10 GeV) [49] is applied. An overall 6.1% uncertainty on the luminosity [35] is assigned to the measured cross sections and is fully correlated across all bins of the differential cross section.",

For p top T and |y top | distributions we present the average t andt cross sections. The differential cross sections are listed in Table VII to IX in Appendix A. Note that the correlated normalization uncertainty on the differential data points is about \u00b16.6%, dominated by the uncertainty on the measurement of the integrated luminosity. For quantitative comparison to SM predictions, the covariance matrices (Tables X-XII) for the results are presented in Appendix A. No bin centering correction is applied to the measurements, and the cross sections are displayed at the center of each bin. Contributions beyond the highest bin boundary are included in the last bin of the m(tt), |y top |, and p top T distributions. As shown in Fig. 6, there are no contributions to the differential cross section for m(tt) below 240 GeV. Figure 9(a) shows the cross section for the unfolded data as a function of m(tt) and (b) shows the ratio of the cross section and several predictions to the approximate NNLO distribution [24]. Within the systematic uncertainties the mc@nlo and approximate NNLO describe the data, while the alpgen prediction is low in absolute normalization as shown in Fig. 9(b). The distribution for |y top | is shown in Fig. 10. The ratio in Fig.  10(b) indicates that the distribution predicted by QCD at approximate NNLO is in marginal agreement with the data for |y top |. The predictions by mc@nlo describe the data better.

The solution with the best \u03c7 2 for assigning the reconstructed objects to the parton-level quantities serves as the input to the unfolding (see Sec. VII). This solution corresponds to the correct assign-ment of the jets to the quarks from the tt decay in MC events in 80% of the cases. The observed and expected distributions in \u03c7 2 are compared inFig. 5. The modeling of signal and background processes is verified through a comparison of the data to the number of expected tt signal events and the sum of all background contributions. The expected tt contribution is derived employing mc@nlo simulated events normalized to the measured inclusive cross section of 8.0 pb. Figures 6-8 show the reconstructed m(tt), |y top |, and p top T distributions before unfolding. The |y top | and p top T distributions include both W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd and W \u2192 qq \u2032 decay modes (two entries per event). The resolutions in the two decay modes are similar, hence they are combined. The distributions in (a) of Figs. 6-8 show the data compared to the tt signal and background processes, while (b) shows the background-subtracted data. The data and its description by the sum of signal and background processes agree within uncertainties.",
