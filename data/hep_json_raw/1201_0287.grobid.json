CP violation is labelled \"direct\" if there are different decay widths for a particle and the antiparticle and \"indirect\" if it occurs as a result of \"mixing\" or oscillation of one neutral meson system to another. Hadronic decays of charm and beauty hadrons are powerful probes of flavor dynamics, and CDF has accumulated large samples of these decays. This talk will focus on three areas: (1) charmless decays of B 0 , B 0 s , and \u039b b to two charged hadrons, (2) B \u2212 decays to D 0 h \u2212 and D 0 h \u2212 (and charge conjugates) followed by D \u2192 K\u03c0 (h = K or \u03c0) , and (3) D * -tagged decays of D 0 and D 0 to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 final states.",

We exploit the long B lifetime, vertex-pointing, hard fragmentation, and high B-mass to select two-body B-decay candidates. The impact parameter of the B is required to be less than 140 \u00b5m and the transverse path length of the candidate is required to be greater than 200 \u00b5m. This gives an overall acceptance of about 2% for b-hadrons with p T > 4 GeV/c and pseudo-rapidity (\u22121 < \u03b7 < +1). The trigger selection must be confirmed more accurately offline, and cuts on additional variables such as isolation and 3-D vertex quality are imposed. The present analysis uses data from 6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. Despite good mass resolution (\u02dc22 MeV/c 2 ) individual decay modes overlap when plotted as M \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 in a single peak of width\u02dc35 MeV/c 2 . We exploit the correlation between momenta and invariant mass and particle ID information from the drift chamber (dE/dx) to determine signal composition using an extended maximum likelihood fit. Monte Carlo events are used to model the different signals. The maximum likelihood fit results are shown in Fig. 1(a) and yield 10,200",
