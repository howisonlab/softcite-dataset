This technique could significantly improve the reconstruction of the neutrino energy spectra. Since it allows a separation between hydrogen and the accompanying nuclei, this technique also enables us to measure nuclear effects in neutrino interactions directly.",

            "text": "The ability to measure the energy spectrum of a neutrino [1] beam has many physics implications [2,3]. The accuracy of the measurement depends on the spectral shape, the energy reconstruction and the understanding of the cross sections of the processes by which the neutrino interactions are detected. The conventional measurement of the energy spectra of neutrino beams is via charged-current quasi-elastic scattering (CCQE) on nucleons: \u03bd + n \u2192 l \u2212 + p and\u03bd + p \u2192 l + + n, where \u03bd/\u03bd, n, p and l \u2213 stand for neutrino/anti-neutrino, neutron, proton and the corresponding charged leptons, respectively. The neutrino energy can be calculated using the lepton momentum, assuming a static nucleon in the initial state [3,4]. With a nuclear target, the accuracy is limited by the binding energy and the Fermi motion (FM) of the nucleon, both subject to large fluctuations, and by other initial-state uncertainties. When the momentum of the final-state nucleon is measured, the neutrino energy can be reconstructed by summing all the finalstate particle momenta. However, the kinematics of the final-state nucleon are altered by final-state interactions (FSIs) as the nucleon re-interacts with the cold nuclear medium before leaving the target nucleus. FSIs can be so strong that the nucleus is excited or even breaks up, emitting low momentum particles such as nucleons, photons and pions, which are stopped near the vertex and not detected in tracking detectors, leading to greater bias in the reconstructed energy. Therefore a third approach (not restricted to CCQE) is to sum the lepton energy and the visible energy of the hadronic system [2,5,6], which is limited by a reduced influence from nucleon initialstate uncertainties and by the systematics in measuring the energy of neutral particles. Among those initialstate uncertainties, multi-nucleon correlations [7][8][9][10][11][12] are under intense study. Such nuclear modifications make the calculation of the CCQE cross section difficult. Furthermore, in non-CCQE interactions such as resonance production, the final-state pions can re-scatter, exchange charge, or be absorbed in the nuclear medium [13]. Such background events are often mis-identified as CCQE due to the identical final-state particles and therefore intro-duce an ambiguity in the cross section definition. More details about neutrino-nucleus interactions can be found in Refs. [14,15] and references therein.",

This is independent of the neutrino energy and the resonance kinematics. The \u03b4p TT for a nuclear target has the following properties: (1) It is distributed symmetrically around zero because the initial proton motion and the decay kinematics of the resonance are uncorrelated to z TT (except for uncommon cases such as polarized spatially-asymmetric nuclear targets, or if the detection acceptance varies for different final-state particles).",

The randomness of FM further smears out \u03b4p TT . 3The resonance and the decay products experience FSI. Such modification of the kinematics further adds to the broadening of the \u03b4p TT distribution. The difference between the \u03b4p TT shapes for hydrogen and nuclear targets is dramatic (see Fig. 2). As can be seen in the figure, the shapes of the nuclear distributions predicted by NuWro [17] vary only slightly among nuclei heavier than deuteron. Therefore for a multi-nuclear target with hydrogen, assuming perfect detector response, one expects a hydrogen signal at \u03b4p TT = 0 on top of a symmetric nuclear background that is about 200 MeV/c wide. At the reconstruction level, the shape of the hydrogen peak, which is still symmetric, is solely determined by the detector response. The nuclear background contamination under the hydrogen peak depends on the background shape and the resonance production cross section ratio between the nucleus and hydrogen, which equals roughly the atomic number of the nucleus modulo nuclear effects. Improving the detector resolution [18] will lead to a strong signal enhancement and eventually an event-by-event selection of hydrogen interactions. Once the hydrogen interactions are selected, the neutrino energy can be reconstructed by summing the final-state energy [19]. The energy reconstruction quality is solely determined by detector response and not limited by nuclear effects.",

If the signal width is at the sub-hundred MeV level, the fit may not be sensitive to the detail of the complicated nuclear tails. The cross section of the resonance production on hydrogen, which is independent of nuclear effects, can be obtained from the signal part. The yield ratio between the hydrogen signal and the remaining contribution from the other target nuclei is a precise measurement of the associated nuclear effects with cancellation of detection acceptance and efficiencies for both targets. Such measurement of the resonance production on hydrogen and nuclei should largely improve the understanding of the production mechanism and its modification by the nuclear medium.",

            "text": "More challenging background processes are those with intrinsic zero \u03b4p TT . One type of such background is the exclusive processes which have identical final states as the signal, such as higher mass resonances and non-resonant production [25]. Those processes do not affect the neutrino energy reconstruction, but make it difficult to define the interaction cross section which is needed to determine the beam energy spectrum. To distinguish among underlying processes, the detailed interaction kinematics could be used, such as the invariant mass of the hadronic system W and the squared four-momentum exchange to the proton t. This is feasible thanks to the essential features -being exclusive and nuclear effect-independent -that make the neutrino energy reconstruction precise. Because the cross sections have different dependence on W and t, efficient separation should be possible. Since the relevant final state kinematics do not depend on the identity of the intermediate state, alternatively one could extend the definition of the production channel to include all contributions that have exclusive p\u03c0 + final states and calculate the corresponding cross section [26,27]. Another type of background is the \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) contamination in the\u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) CC interaction. Such \"wrong sign\" background occurs more often in an anti-neutrino beam created in a proton accelerator. Because of the similar particle identification (PID) signals for the muon and pion, the \u00b5 \u2212 +\u03c0 + +p final states from the \u03bd \u00b5 background might be misidentified in the event selection as \u03c0 \u2212 +\u00b5 + +p from \u03bd \u00b5 , and vice versa. For a large enough detection volume, the properties of stopped pions can be used to enhance the pion identification. In addition to measuring trajectory \"kinks\" [28] and the Michel electrons [29], negative pions that are stopped and absorbed by nuclei give rise to soft nuclear emission which can be measured by calorimetry [30]. The lepton, \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 signatures are different and serve as an important tool not only for l/\u03c0 separation, but also for rejecting \"wrong sign\" contamination. In addition, variables like W , which is calculated from the true p\u00b5 system due to wrong PID, can provide background rejection power due to the unphysical kinematic combination [31]. In this work, MC simulation of the T2K ND280 detector [32] is used to demonstrate the measurement of CC resonance production in neutrino-hydrogen interactions, \u03bd \u00b5 + H \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 + \u2206 ++ . Neutrino interactions in ND280 are simulated using the Neut event generator [33]. The event reconstruction uses the first fine-grained detector (FGD [34]) as a plastic scintillator (polystyrene) interaction target and the neighboring gaseous time projection chamber (TPC [35]) downstream to measure the momenta and specific energy loss (dE/dx) of the final-state particles. There are about 300 true \u2206 ++ events on hydrogen in the neutrino energy range 0.5 < E \u03bd\u00b5 < 5 GeV in the reconstructed sample.",

The uncertainty in an example E \u03bd\u00b5 bin is shown in Fig. 5. Like \u03b4p TT , it is determined by pure detector resolution due to the free and static proton target and can be described by a Cauchy function. As a comparison, the neutrino energy in the same range is reconstructed with all final-state kinematics from CCQE interactions on carbon assuming static neutron targets. This simple reconstruction suffers from nuclear effects in addition to the detector resolution and is biased by about \u22122% with a large spread. In addition, the neutrino energy distribution reconstructed only with the muon kinematics [4,36] shows worse performance. The comparison between both CCQE methods indicates that, for the relatively weak FSI predicted in the current model, an independent measurement of the proton kinematics help improve the E \u03bd\u00b5 resolution even in the presence of FSI. The simulated E \u03bd\u00b5 detector response (the Cauchy mean and width) is further shown as a function of the true energy in Fig. 6. The energy scale is seen to be constant with a bias of about - 1%, and the resolution slowly increases from about 3% to 10% in the 0.5 -5 GeV region. The worsening of resolution at high energy is general for a tracker measurement, in contrast to calorimetry [2,5,6].",

Due to the absence of nuclear effects, for hydrogen the resolution is determined by the detector response, which can be described in the simulation by a Cauchyfunction 1/N \u2022 dN/d\u03b4p TT = 1/\u03c0 \u2022 \u03c3/[\u03c3 2 + (\u03b4p TT \u2212 m) 2 ]with the event count N , mean m and width \u03c3. The resolution is shown to be significantly smaller than the nuclear broadening in the carbon target nuclei. The nuclear rejection factor defined as the efficiency ratio between hydrogen and carbon is about 3.7 (2.3) in the 1 (3) \u03c3 interval. The reconstruction performance of \u03b4p TT as a function of the neutrino energy is shown inFig. 4. It indicates a better hydrogen selection at lower energy.From the MC true hydrogen-resonance events in the reconstructed sample, the neutrino energy E \u03bd\u00b5 is calculated directly using the kinematics of all final-state particles. The uncertainty in an example E \u03bd\u00b5 bin is shown inFig. 5. Like \u03b4p TT , it is determined by pure detector resolution due to the free and static proton target and can be described by a Cauchy function. As a comparison, the neutrino energy in the same range is reconstructed with all final-state kinematics from CCQE interactions on carbon assuming static neutron targets. This simple reconstruction suffers from nuclear effects in addition to the detector resolution and is biased by about \u22122% with a large spread. In addition, the neutrino energy distribution reconstructed only with the muon kinematics[4,36] shows worse performance. The comparison between both CCQE methods indicates that, for the relatively weak FSI predicted in the current model, an independent measurement of the proton kinematics help improve the E \u03bd\u00b5 resolution even in the presence of FSI. The simulated E \u03bd\u00b5 detector response (the Cauchy mean and width) is further shown as a function of the true energy inFig. 6. The energy scale is seen to be constant with a bias of about -",
