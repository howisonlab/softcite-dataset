            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5] is a widely considered extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics, as it can provide solutions to several open questions in the SM, in particular those related to the hierarchy problem [6][7][8] and the nature of dark matter. SUSY predicts superpartners of SM particles whose spins differ by one-half unit with respect to their SM partners. In R-parity conserving models [9], SUSY particles are pair-produced and their decay chains end in the stable, lightest SUSY particle (LSP), which in many models corresponds to the lightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ). A stable LSP would escape undetected, yielding a characteristic signature of a large magnitude of missing transverse momentum (p miss T ) in collisions at the CERN LHC. As a stable, neutral and weakly interacting particle, the neutralino matches the properties required of a dark matter candidate [10].",

Another interpretation for the absence of a SUSY signal is that the SUSY particles are in a part of the parameter space that is not easily accessible. One such scenario, where previously mentioned searches would not be sensitive, is where the mass spectrum is compressed, i.e. the mass splitting between the produced SUSY particles and the LSP is small. When the mass splittings between SUSY particles are small, the visible energy in the event, and also potentially the p miss T , is relatively low, which motivates searches in events with low-momentum objects.",

            "text": "Compressed mass spectra arise in several SUSY models, including natural SUSY, i.e. SUSY models that solve the hierarchy problem with little fine tuning. It has been pointed out in several studies, for example in Refs. [6][7][8][11][12][13][14][15], that naturalness imposes constraints on the masses of higgsinos, top squarks, and gluinos. Natural SUSY is generally considered to require at least one coloured SUSY particle of mass below approximately one TeV. Further, it is often assumed that this particle is the top squark ( t). More recently, however, the hypothesis of natural SUSY requiring a light top squark has been disputed as arising from oversimplified assumptions [16][17][18]. Irrespective of the top squark, higgsinos remain a complementary window to natural SUSY as they are generally expected to be light. As pointed out in Refs. [19][20][21][22], light higgsinos are likely to have a compressed mass spectrum, potentially leading to signatures with soft leptons and moderate p miss T . Thus far, the most sensitive searches in this model have been carried out by experiments at LEP [23,24] and ATLAS [25]. The LEP experiments excluded \u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses up to 103.5 GeV for a mass splitting between the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 1 of at least 3 GeV. The search described in this letter is designed for neutralinos and charginos, which are collectively referred to as \"electroweakinos\", in a model where these electroweakinos form a compressed mass spectrum [19,21,22,26]. Two models are considered where the electroweakinos are either pure wino/bino-like or where the lightest electroweakinos are of mostly higgsino nature. The search has discovery potential also when a light top squark and the LSP are nearly degenerate in mass and the top squark decays to four fermions. A more detailed discussion of such models can be found in Ref. [27]. The near-degeneracy in mass of the top squark and the LSP is typical of the so-called \"co-annihilation region\", in which the LSP is the sole source of dark matter [28].",

At least one jet is required in the final state; in the case of the signal, this jet must arise from ISR, which provides the final-state particles with a boost in the transverse plane, and thereby the potential for moderate or large p miss T in the event.

While the model described above uses pure wino cross sections with the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1  In addition to the electroweakino models, we interpret the results in a phenomenological minimal supersymmetric model (pMSSM) [51], in which the higgsino (\u03bc), bino (M 1 ), and wino (M 2 ) mass parameters are varied. There is only a small dependency on tan \u03b2, which is set to 10. All other mass parameters are assumed to be decoupled. To reduce the parameter space to a twodimensional grid, M 2 is set to 2M 1 . This convention is inspired by electroweakino mass unification at the grand unified theory scale. Since the focus is on electroweak production only, the gluino mass parameter M 3 is assumed to be decoupled. All trilinear couplings are discarded. In this model, the higgsino mass parameter \u03bc is varied between 100 and 200 GeV, while M 1 varies between 300 GeV and 1 TeV. Events for this \"higgsino pMSSM\" are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo [52]. The NLO cross sections are computed using Prospino 2 [53].

The quantity M(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) [22] is computed as follows: since the \u03c4 leptons from the decay of a Z boson have large p T compared to their mass, the direction of the outgoing lepton is approximately the same as that of the \u03c4 lepton (i.e. R( , \u03c4 ) \u2248 0). The magnitudes of the lepton momentum vectors are then rescaled so that the lepton pair balances the hadronic recoil.

The invariant mass of the two \u03c4 leptons, M(\u03c4 \u03c4 ), is estimated by the invariant mass of the two scaled leptons. In some events, the estimate of the magnitude of the \u03c4 momentum results in a negative value when the flight direction is opposite to the direction of the lepton.

In particular, for the electroweakino benchmark, the modelling of the ISR with MadGraph5_amc@nlo affects the total transverse momentum p ISR T of the system of SUSY particles, which can be improved by reweighting p ISR T in the simulated signal events. This reweighting is based on p T studies of events containing a Z boson [75], in which the factors range between 1.18 at p ISR T of 125 GeV, and 0.78 for p ISR T > 600 GeV. The deviation from 1.0 is taken as the systematic uncertainty of the reweighting procedure. For the t benchmark to improve the modelling of the multiplicity of additional jets from ISR, the events are reweighted based on the N ISR jets , using the same corrections used for the top background as described earlier in this section. The typical uncertainties on the final results from the ISR modelling are found to be in the range 2-7%.",

To remain fully efficient after offline reconstruction, an upper bound of 50 GeV on M( ) and a lower requirement on the dilepton transverse momentum p T ( ) > 3 GeV are imposed. \u2022 H T > 100 GeV: this requirement suppresses backgrounds with low hadronic activity in the event. For the selected events, a set of SRs are defined, based on the dilepton invariant mass and p miss T . For events with leptons of same flavour and opposite charge, four SRs are defined in M( ) ranges of 4-9, 10.5-20, 20-30, and 30-50 GeV. These SRs are intended for searches for \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 Z * \u03c7 0 1 events, where M( ) is related to the mass difference between the two electroweakinos. For events with leptons of different flavour and opposite charge, three SRs are defined in the leading lepton p T ranges of 5-12, 12-20, and 20-30 GeV. The definition of the bins of the SRs can be found in Table 2. To exploit the potential of the dimuon plus p miss T trigger, events are separated according to the value of p miss T : in total three ranges are used for the signal regions, namely p miss T \u2208 125-200, 200-300, and >300 GeV for the t search, and p miss T \u2208 125-200, 200-250, and >250 GeV for the electroweakino search. Since the low-p miss T region contains events accessible only via the dimuon + p miss T trigger, only \u03bc\u03bc pairs are considered. The muons need to be of opposite charge. Conversely, in the high-p miss T regions, both electron and muon flavours are considered. The electroweakino SRs are populated by ee and \u03bc\u03bc pairs, where the leptons are oppositely",
