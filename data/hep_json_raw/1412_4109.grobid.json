The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 , were collected with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2012. The five studies differ in the leptonic signature from the W boson decays, and correspond to all-hadronic, single-lepton, opposite-sign dilepton, same-sign dilepton, and \u22653 lepton final states. The results of the five studies are combined to yield 95% confidence level limits for the gluino and bottom-squark masses in the context of gluino and bottom-squark pair production, respectively. In the limit when the lightest supersymmetric particle is light, gluino and bottom squark masses are excluded below 1280 and 570 GeV, respectively.",

The discovery of a Higgs boson by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] Collaborations at the CERN LHC represents the latest major milestone in the validation of the SM. Despite its success, the SM is known to be incomplete because, for example, it does not offer an explanation for dark matter and it contains ad-hoc features, such as the fine-tuning [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] required to stabilize the Higgs boson mass at the electroweak scale. Many extensions to the SM have been proposed. In particular, supersymmetry (SUSY) may provide a candidate for dark matter in R-parity conserving models [10] as well as a natural solution to the fine-tuning problem [3][4][5][6][7][8][9].",

Direct or cascade production of third-generation squarks can lead to final states with several W bosons and bottom quarks, and considerable imbalance p miss T in transverse momentum. The missing momentum arises from neutrinos in events where one or more W bosons decay leptonically, but also, for the R-parity conserving models considered here, because the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), taken to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 , is weakly interacting and stable, escaping without detection. The studies presented here focus on SUSY simplified model scenarios [27,28] with four W bosons. Each of the W bosons can decay either into a quarkantiquark pair or into a charged lepton and its neutrino. Depending on the decay modes of the W bosons, the final states contain 0-4 leptons. This makes combining the final states with different lepton multiplicities beneficial. The dilepton signature is split according to the relative electric charges of the leptons, providing five mutually exclusive analyses for the combination: fully hadronic, single-lepton, opposite-sign dilepton, same-sign dilepton, and \u22653 leptons (multilepton). The results are based on proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2012, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 . The first simplified model we consider describes gluino pair production, followed by the decay of each gluino to a top quarkantiquark pair (tt) and the LSP. For cases where the top squark mass is larger than the gluino mass, the decay will proceed http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2015.04.002 0370-2693/\u00a9 2015 CERN for the benefit of the CMS Collaboration.

Alternatively, when the top squark mass is smaller than the gluino mass and phase space allows, the decay will proceed through an onshell top squark (T5tttt model, Fig. 1 middle). Each top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W boson, leading to final states with four W bosons, four bottom-quark jets (b jets), and considerable p miss",

The production of single top quarks in association with an additional quark and a Z boson is simulated with the mc@nlo 2.0.0 [42,43] generator. The PYTHIA 6.4.24 [44] generator is used to simulate the generic multijet QCD and diboson (WW, ZZ, and WZ) processes, as well as to describe the parton shower and hadronization for the MadGraph samples.

The fast simulation is validated through comparison of its predictions with those of the full simulation, and efficiency corrections based on data are applied [47].

To prevent overlap between the same-sign dilepton and multilepton analyses, an explicit veto on additional leptons with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 is added for the same-sign dilepton analysis, as in the search for t 2 production described in Ref. [ There are three main sources of SM background in this analysis: non-prompt leptons, rare SM processes, and electrons with wrong charge assignments. The main sources of non-prompt leptons are leptons from bottom-and charm-quark decays, misidentified hadrons, muons from light-meson decays in flight, and electrons from unidentified photon conversions. The background from non-prompt leptons is evaluated from data control regions. Diboson, ttW, and ttZ production are the most important rare SM background sources. Their contributions are estimated from MC simulation. Opposite-sign dileptons can also contribute to the background when the charge of an electron is misidentified because of bremsstrahlung emitted in the tracker material. This contribution is estimated using a technique based on Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 data. No significant deviations are observed from the SM expectations.",

After applying the selection criteria summarized in Table 1, the remaining SM background is primarily composed of events with tt, Drell-Yan, and W + jets production.",

They are evaluated separately for the different signal models, search regions, and for each hypothesis for the SUSY particle masses. The systematic uncertainties in the signal modeling are taken to be 100% correlated among the mass hypotheses. As an example, a summary of systematic uncertainties for the T1tttt model is given in Table 3. The total systematic uncertainty varies between 7 and 35% depending on the decay modes considered, the search regions, and the mass points. An important source of systematic uncertainty for the analyses that require multiple leptons arises from the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies, which are evaluated using Z \u2192 + \u2212 events. The uncertainty in the energy scale of jets gives rise to a 1-15% systematic uncertainty that increases with more stringent kinematic requirements. For compressed spectra, the modeling of initial-state radiation (ISR) [18] is an important source of uncertainty. The PDF4LHC recommendations [51,52] are used to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the parton distribution functions (PDFs). For most of the analyses the background evaluation methods differ, and so the systematic uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated. The overlap between most control regions is studied and found to be negligible. The only exception occurs for the same-sign dilepton and multilepton analyses, which use the same methods to predict the background from non-prompt leptons and rare SM processes. For this case, the systematic uncertainties are taken to be fully correlated.",

The signature contains four top quarks and has significant jet activity ( Fig. 1 left). The fully hadronic and single-lepton analyses are therefore expected to be especially sensitive, because of their larger signal efficiencies. Fig. 5 (left) shows the 95% CL upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction in the (m \u03c7 0 1 , m g ) plane. The exclusion curves are evaluated by comparing the cross section upper limits with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) plus next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL) theoretical production cross sections [54][55][56][57][58]. The thick red dashed line indicates the 95% CL expected limit, which is defined as the median of the upper limit distribution obtained using pseudo-experiments and a likelihood model.

The contribution from the fully hadronic analysis remains important even for relatively small top squark masses m t \u2248 200 GeV because of the high H T search regions: signal events in this case contain smaller E miss T but larger H T . However, for m t < 150 GeV, the fully hadronic analysis loses sensitivity. The single-lepton analysis provides the most stringent individual results, but loses sensitivity as m t decreases.

The results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 of pp collisions, collected with the CMS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV in 2012. Because of their large branching fractions, the single-lepton and fully hadronic analyses have the largest sensitivity for most of the range of the supersymmetric mass spectra, whereas the analyses with higher lepton multiplicities have higher sensitivity for models with more compressed mass spectra. The complementarity of the searches is exploited to provide comprehensive coverage across a wide region of parameter space. The combined searches yield 95% confidence level exclusions of up to 1280 and 570 GeV for the gluino and bottom-squark masses in the context of gluino and bottom-squark pair production, respectively. The increase in sensitivity that arises from the combination of the five analyses corresponds to an increase of about 50 GeV in the SUSY mass reach compared to the individual analyses.",

For m GeV, the combination is seen to extend the gluino mass exclusion by about 35 GeV compared to the single-lepton analysis, which provides the most stringent corresponding individual result. Large values of m \u03c7 0 1 lead to more compressed mass spectra, softer decay products, and therefore smaller E miss T . As a result, the fully hadronic and single-lepton analyses become less sensitive, since they require high-p T jets and large E miss T . The dilepton and multilepton analyses depend less on the p T spectrum of the final-state particles, and their sensitivity decreases less for smaller mass splittings. Thus the analyses requiring two or more leptons contribute most to the overall sensitivity when the difference m g \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 becomes small. For m g \u2248 1000 GeV, the exclusion limit on m \u03c7 0 1 is extended by about 60 GeV because of the addition of the multilepton channels.",
