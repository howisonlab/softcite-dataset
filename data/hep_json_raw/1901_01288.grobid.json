This search targets a region of parameter space where the kinematics of top squark pair production and top quark pair production are very similar, because of the mass difference between the top squark and the neutralino being close to the top quark mass. The search is performed with 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS detector in 2016, using events containing one electron-muon pair with opposite charge. The search is based on a precise estimate of the top quark pair background, and the use of the M T2 variable, which combines the transverse mass of each lepton and the missing transverse momentum. No excess of events is found over the standard model predictions. Exclusion limits are placed at 95% confidence level on the production of top squarks up to masses of 208 GeV for models with a mass difference between the top squark and the lightest neutralino close to that of the top quark.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics accurately describes the vast majority of the observed particle physics phenomena. However, there are several open problems that cannot be explained by the SM, such as the hierarchy problem, the need for fine tuning to explain the large difference between the electroweak and the Planck scale [1,2], and the lack of a candidate particle that explains the nature of dark matter in cosmological and astrophysical observations [3,4]. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] is a well-motivated extension of the SM that provides a technically natural [14,15] solution to both of these problems, through the introduction of an additional symmetry between bosons and fermions. In SUSY models, large quantum loop corrections to the masses of the Higgs bosons, mainly produced by the top quark, are mostly cancelled by the one produced by its SUSY partner, the top squark ( t 1 ), if their masses are close in value. Similar cancellations occur for other particles, resulting in a natural solution to the hierarchy problem. Furthermore, SUSY introduces a new quantum number, R-parity [16], that distinguishes between SUSY and SM particles. If R-parity is conserved [16], top squarks are produced in pairs and the lightest SUSY particle is stable, which if neutral ( \u03c7 matter. The lighter SUSY particles may have masses close to those of the SM particles, and therefore could be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions within the energy reach of the CERN LHC. In certain scenarios the lightest top squarks are expected to have a mass (m t 1 ) close to the top quark mass (m t ), leading to a natural solution to the hierarchy problem [14,15,17]. This paper presents a search for the production of a pair of scalar top partners and neutralinos that are degenerate or nearly degenerate in mass with the top quark (m t 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 m t ), using events produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. A data sample collected during 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 is used.",

Since events with M T2 = 0 GeV do not provide any discrimination between signal and tt background, only events with M T2 > 0 GeV are used for hypothesis testing. Figure 2 shows the M T2 distributions for signal and background for different mass hypotheses for the stop squark and neutralino. The M T2 distributions of the simulated signal models are characterized by a slightly different shape for M T2 values smaller than 80 GeV and a large difference for M T2 > 80 GeV, because of the presence of the endpoint in the M T2 distribution for tt events.

The accurate knowledge of the tt production process has been previously demonstrated in several cross section measurements by the CMS Collaboration [31]. Moreover, its differential cross section as a function of different variables has been measured [72] and MC parameters have been tuned using an independent data sample [39]. The MC tuning does not produce a significant modification of the M T2 shape. The main parameters affecting the tt modelling and their associated uncertainties are discussed in section 7. The tW background gives the second-largest contribution, approximately 4%, and is also modelled using MC simulation. The number of events with nonprompt leptons, including the contribution of events with jets misidentified as leptons or with leptons coming from the decay of a bottom quark mistakenly identified as coming from the hard process, is estimated from an observed control region in which the electron and muon are required to have the same sign of the electric charge (referred to as same-sign), while all other requirements for the event selection are the same as for the signal region. This background is estimated using the observed events in the control region after subtraction of the contribution from the backgrounds that produce prompt leptons. This contribution is estimated from MC simulation and comes mainly from ttW and ttZ events or dileptonic tt with a mismeasurement of the electron charge. The events in this control region are weighted by the expected ratio of oppositesign to same-sign events with nonprompt leptons after the full event selection, which is estimated in MC simulation to be 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 (syst).",

For the nonprompt lepton background, a normalization uncertainty of 30% is applied, taking into account the effect of the limited number of MC events used in the estimation of the same-sign to opposite-sign transfer factor applied, and the normalization of the prompt-process subtraction in the control region. Furthermore, a 15% uncertainty in the signal normalization is assigned, according to the uncertainties in the predicted cross section of signal models in the top squark mass range of the analysis [55]. The effect on the acceptance of the uncertainties in the factorization and renormalization scales is taken into account by varying \u00b5 F and \u00b5 R by factors of 2 and 1/2 both [79]. This uncertainty is propagated to the signal yields, resulting in an uncertainty in each M T2 bins of the order of 0.5-1.0%.",

For the difference in masses of \u2206m( t 1 , \u03c7 0 1 ) = 167.5 and 182.5 GeV, the sensitivity of the analysis is mostly driven by the differences between the signal and tt distributions for high M T2 values (M T2 80 GeV).
