No evidence of events beyond the background expectation is found. Upper limits on the non-resonant pp \u2192 HH production cross section of 10 pb and on the resonant production cross section as a function of the HH invariant mass are obtained. Resonant production limits are set for scalar and spin-2 graviton hypotheses in the mass range 500 to 3000 GeV.",

In this mechanism, an SU(2) doublet scalar field is subject to a potential energy term whose shape allows the doublet field to acquire a vacuum expectation value that breaks the SU(2) symmetry and produces the Higgs boson and its potential energy term. This potential is the last piece of the SM Lagrangian which is yet to be directly tested.",

            "text": "This paper reports results of a search for Higgs boson pair production where one Higgs boson decays via H \u2192 bb, and the other decays via H \u2192 W W * . The H \u2192 W W * branching fraction is the second largest after H \u2192 bb, so the bbW W * final state can be sensitive to HH production if the signal can be well separated from the dominant tt background. The W W * system decays into \u03bdqq, where is either an electron or a muon, and the small contamination from leptonic \u03c4 decays is not explicitly vetoed in the analysis. Two complementary techniques are used to reconstruct the Higgs boson candidate that decays into two b quarks. Both techniques use the anti-k t jet algorithm [26] but JHEP04(2019)092 with different radius parameters. The first technique employs jets with radius parameter R = 0.4 and it is used when each b quark from the H \u2192 bb decay can be reconstructed as a distinct b jet. The second technique is used when this is not possible, due to the large boost of the b-quark pair. In this case the Higgs boson candidate is identified as a single anti-k t jet with radius parameter R = 1.0. The analysis using the first technique is referred to as the \"resolved\" analysis and that using the second technique is referred to as the \"boosted\" analysis. In both analyses, the jets from the hadronically decaying W boson are reconstructed as anti-k t jets with radius parameter R = 0.4. The resonant HH search is performed using both the resolved and the boosted analysis methods. The resolved analysis is performed between 500 and 3000 GeV, while the boosted analysis between 800 and 3000 GeV. The resolved analysis is divided into three selections, one targeting low mass values, a second designed for high mass values and a specific analysis for the 500 GeV mass value. Because the three resolved, and the boosted analyses do not select orthogonal samples, they are not combined statistically. However, results from all these different techniques are presented to illustrate their sensitivity reach. For the non-resonant search a dedicated selection of the resolved analysis is used.",

Therefore, the spin-0 states were treated as narrow heavy neutral Higgs bosons, while the spin-2 states were modelled as Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravitons [28,29]. The parameters used in the RS graviton simulation were: c = k/M Pl equal to 1.0 or 2.0, where k is the curvature of the warped extra dimension and M Pl = 2.4 \u00d7 10 18 GeV is the effective four-dimensional Planck scale. The graviton signal samples were generated at leading order (LO) with Madgraph5 aMC@NLO [30] using the NNPDF2.3 [31] LO parton distribution function (PDF) set, and Pythia 8.186 [32] to model the parton showers and hadronisation process with a set of tuned underlyingevent parameters called the A14 tune [33].

The simulation produced the Higgs boson pair through gluon-gluon fusion using an effective field theory approach to take into account the finite value of the top-quark mass m t [36]. Events were first generated with an effective Lagrangian in the infinite top-quark mass approximation, and then reweighted with form factors that take into account the finite mass of the top quark. The non-resonant signal samples were simulated with Madgraph5 aMC@NLO + Herwig++ using the CT10 PDF set; and the same approach for the inclusion of finite m t effects was used [37]. In addition, scale factors dependent on the HH invariant mass m HH at generator level were applied to match the MC m HH distribution with an NLO calculation that computes exact finite m t contributions [38]. All signal samples were generated with 100% of Higgs boson pairs decaying into bbW W * , and the samples were then normalised assuming B(H \u2192 W W * ) = 0.22 and B(H \u2192 bb) = 0.57 [7].",

The jet mass (m J ) resolution is improved at high momentum using tracking in addition to calorimeter information [62]. This leads to a smaller mass resolution and better estimate of the median mass value than obtained using only calorimeter energy clusters. The energy and mass scales of the trimmed jets are then calibrated using p T -and \u03b7-dependent calibration factors derived from simulation [63]. Large-R jets are required to have p T > 250 GeV, m J > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. The identification of large-R jets consistent with boosted Higgs boson decays uses jets built from tracks reconstructed from the ATLAS Inner Detector (referred to as track-jets) to identify the b jets within the large-R jets. The track-jets are built with the anti-k t algorithm with R = 0.2 [64]. They are required to have p T > 10 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5, and are matched to the large-R jets with a ghost-association algorithm [65]. The small radius parameter of the track-jets enables two nearby b hadrons to be identified when their \u2206R separation is less than 0.4, which is beneficial when reconstructing high-p T Higgs boson candidates. The b-tagging requirements of the boosted analyses use working points that lead to an efficiency of 77% for b jets with p T > 20 GeV when evaluated in a sample of simulated tt events. At this efficiency, for jets with a p T distribution similar to that originating from jets in tt events, the charm-quark component is suppressed by a factor of 12 (7.1) for the R = 0.4 jets (track-jets), while the light-quark component is suppressed by a factor of 380 for the jets with R = 0.4 and 120 for the track-jets.",

Among all four-momenta of the final-state particles, only the component of the neutrino momentum along the beam axis, referred to as longitudinal momentum (p z ) in the following, is unknown while its transverse momentum is assumed to be the E miss T . The longitudinal momentum of the neutrino is computed by solving a quadratic equation in p z , employing the four-momenta of the lepton and the hadronic W boson, the E miss T , and the m H = 125 GeV constraint on the W W * system. No W -boson mass constraint is applied to either the hadronic or the leptonic W boson decay, allowing either W boson to be off-shell. Whenever two real solutions are obtained, the \u03bd candidate with the smallest \u2206R relative to the lepton direction is retained. Studies performed by matching the \u03bd candidate with the MC generator-level neutrino show that this procedure finds the correct solution for the neutrino p z in 60% (75%) of cases for a resonant signal of mass 700 (3000) GeV. If two complex solutions are found, only the real part of the solutions is retained. longitudinal momentum computed, the di-Higgs invariant mass can be fully reconstructed and employed to discriminate against backgrounds. Kinematic selections are used to suppress the tt background relative to the signal. The tt events are typically characterised by two b jets and two W bosons such that the \u2206R separation between the b jets is large, and similarly the \u2206R separation between the W bosons is also large. In contrast, in particular when the invariant mass of the heavy resonance is large, the signal is characterised by two b jets and two W bosons which are closer in \u2206R in signal events with respect to the tt background events. Moreover, for the signal the two b jets have an invariant mass equal to m H , while this is not the case for the tt background, where a much broader distribution is expected.

No evidence of an excess of events over the background expectation is found.

            "text": "figure 1(b), are the leading-order Feynman diagrams for Higgs boson pair production. The SM cross section for pp \u2192 HH is extremely small, e.g. 33.4 fb at 13 TeV[7].Physics beyond the SM can manifest in the increased production with respect to the SM predictions of the non-resonant HH final state or in the resonant production of particles that decay into a pair of SM Higgs bosons. The analysis presented here is potentially sensitive to cases where the decaying particle is a scalar, as in the MSSM[8] and 2HDM models[9], or a spin-2 graviton, as in Randall-Sundrum models[10]. The signals under study are non-resonant HH production with event kinematics predicted by the SM and resonant HH production with event kinematics consistent with the decays of heavy spin-0 or spin-2 resonances.Previous searches for pp \u2192 HH production were performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in Run 1 of the LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Decay modes with 4b[11,12], bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212[13,14], \u03b3\u03b3bb[15,16] and \u03b3\u03b3W W *[13] in the final state were studied. Furthermore, ATLAS also published a combination of all of the explored channels[13].Results at \u221a s = 13 TeV were published by the ATLAS Collaboration in the 4b[17], bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212[18,19], bb\u03b3\u03b3 [20] and W W \u03b3\u03b3[21] decay mode and by CMS in the 4b[22] , bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212[23], bb\u03b3\u03b3[24] and in the bbW W * channel using the dileptonic W W * decay mode[25]. Given the low expected yield for SM HH non-resonant production, it is of great importance to understand the sensitivity for the observation of the Higgs boson pair production in all possible decay channels, including bbW W * , which will improve projections for future high-luminosity and high-energy colliders.This paper reports results of a search for Higgs boson pair production where one Higgs boson decays via H \u2192 bb, and the other decays via H \u2192 W W * . The H \u2192 W W * branching fraction is the second largest after H \u2192 bb, so the bbW W * final state can be sensitive to HH production if the signal can be well separated from the dominant tt background. The W W * system decays into \u03bdqq, where is either an electron or a muon, and the small contamination from leptonic \u03c4 decays is not explicitly vetoed in the analysis.Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of resonant production of the Higgs boson pair with the subsequent decays H \u2192 W W * and H \u2192 bb.Two complementary techniques are used to reconstruct the Higgs boson candidate that decays into two b quarks. Both techniques use the anti-k t jet algorithm[26] but",
