Hot and dense de-confined matter, the QGP state, is formed by colliding heavy ions at ultra-relativistic energies [1]. The study of the QGP in the laboratory will allow us to gain a more profound understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. Extending the study of QCD to dynamical, complex systems will let us learn how macroscopic properties of matter emerge from the fundamental microscopic laws of particle physics. The determinations of fundamental properties of this state of matter, such as the critical temperature, the degrees of freedom, and in general the transport coefficients is the objective of heavy-ion physics.",

A large variety of observables are available to the experimentalist to infer the medium properties and to understand the dynamic evolution of the heavy ion collisions. On one hand, soft probes, which have transverse momentum compatible with the temperature of the system, allow us to explore the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the QGP and measure the relevant associated parameters. On the other hand, hard probes (high p T or high mass), that involve scales incompatible with the thermal medium, are exploited as \"external\" probes of the QGP to understand its interactions depending on the color charge, mass and flavor of the probe. In order to establish the (thermo)dynamics properties of the QGP itself, detailed and comprehensive measurements employing different probes have been performed at RHIC and at LHC and a wealth of information has been collected already [2][3][4][5]. There is a good qualitative understanding of the hard probe interactions with the medium, but the complete quantitative understanding of the heavy-ion collision dynamics is still missing.",

These high p T hadrons originate from hard scattered partons produced in the initial stage of the collisions and lose energy while traversing the medium. The partonic shower generated by the hard scattering process following its fragmentation is measured as a collimated jet of hadrons. Due to the jet quenching, both the jet energy and its composition can be modified by the medium. Comparing the jet fragmentation and structure measured in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions will reveal experimentally these modifications. Studying the jet fragmentation pattern and jet structure as a function of parton color charge and quark mass can provide discriminative and crucial information on the parton-shower and energy loss mechanism that in turn will enable to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the partonmedium interactions. It is well established that the parton energy loss is a consequence of the modification of the hard-scattering processes in the final state of the heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC [2][3][4][5], which is accompanied by an enhancement of low p T hadrons, suggesting a softening of jet fragmentations.",

A new approach based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged jets recoiling from a high-p T charged hadron trigger, called \"h-jet\" coincidence, is deployed, where the scaling of the nuclear overlap function T AA is not needed. This approach enables the collinear-safe measurement in heavy-ion collisions of reconstructed jets with low infrared cutoff over a wide range of jet energy and R.

The presence of a \"trigger\" particle, having p T greater than some selected value, serves as part of the selection criteria to analyze the event for a hard scattering. By varying the transverse momentum for trigger (p T,trig ) particles one can probe different momentum scales to study the interplay of soft and hard processes. Dihadron angular correlations represent a powerful complementary tool to study jet modifications on a statistical basis in an energy region where jets cannot be reconstructed. Such studies involve measuring the distributions of the relative azimuthal angle \u03b4\u03c6 and pseudo-rapidity \u03b4\u03b7 between particle pairs consisting of a trigger particle in a certain transverse momentum p T,trig interval and an associated particle in a p T,assoc interval. In these correlations, jet production manifests itself as a peak centered around \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 and \u03b4\u03b7 = 0 (near-side peak) and a structure elongated in \u03b4\u03b7 at \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 (the away side or recoil region).

The extracted shape parameters \u03c3 \u03b4\u03c6 and \u03c3 \u03b4\u03b7 are presented in Fig. 6. The peak width increases towards central events, which is most pronounced in the lowest p T bin. In the higher p T bins no significant width increase can be observed. In the \u03b4\u03b7 direction (right panel) a much larger broadening is found towards central collisions [12].

It can provide information on the possible flavour dependence of jet quenching in the medium. Direct photons are produced during the early stage of the collision, through leading-order pQCD processes such as quark-gluon Compton scattering (qg \u2192 q\u03b3) and quark-antiquark pair annihilation (qq \u2192 g\u03b3 ).

Comparing \u03b3 dir -and \u03c0 0 -triggered yields offers further opportunities to explore the geometric biases and their interplay with parton energy loss.
