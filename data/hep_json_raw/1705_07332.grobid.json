The particles are assumed to be pair-produced in the decay of a 125 GeV/c 2 Standard-Model-like Higgs boson. The experimental signature is a single long-lived particle, identified by a displaced vertex with two associated jets. No excess above background is observed and limits are set on the production cross-section as a function of the mass and lifetime of the long-lived particle.

In this paper we report on a search for such long-lived particles, which are assumed to be pair-produced in the decay of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, and subsequently decay into a quark-antiquark pair. Such a signature is present in models with a hiddensector non-Abelian gauge group, where the Standard Model Higgs boson acts as a portal [1][2][3][4][5]. The new scalar particle represents the lightest state in the hidden sector and is called a hidden-valley pion (\u03c0 v ) throughout this paper. Experimental constraints on the properties of the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV/c 2 observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [6,7] still allow for branching fractions of non-SM decay modes of up to 30% [8].",

In simulated events with \u03c0 v pairs originating from a Higgs boson decay it e-mail: pieter.david@cern.ch is found that in most cases no more than one of the two \u03c0 v decays occurs inside the LHCb acceptance. Consequently, the experimental signature is a single \u03c0 v particle. The candidate is identified by its decay to two hadronic jets originating from a displaced vertex, with a transverse distance to the proton-proton collision axis (R xy ) of at least 0.4 mm. The vertex is required to have at least five tracks reconstructed in the LHCb vertex detector. The analysis is sensitive to \u03c0 v particles with a mass between 25 and 50 GeV/c 2 and a lifetime between 2 and 500 ps. The lifetime range is limited due to the presence of large prompt backgrounds at short decay times and the acceptance of the vertex detector for long decay times. The lower boundary on the mass range arises from the requirement to identify two hadronic jets while the upper boundary is driven by the geometric acceptance of the detector.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detec-tor located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+(29 GeV/c)/ p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the collision axis. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.

Only decays that produce a sufficient number of tracks in the VELO for a vertex to be reconstructed are considered. Due to the geometry of the vertex detector, this restricts the sample to decay points up to about 200 mm from the nominal interaction point along the beam direction, and up to about 30 mm in the transverse direction, thereby limiting the decay time acceptance. The selection strategy is the same as used in the analysis of Ref. [9]. Reconstructed tracks are used to find the decay vertex, and jets are built out of reconstructed particles compatible with originating from that vertex. Constraints on the signal yield are determined from a fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution. The main source of background is displaced vertices from heavy-flavour decays or interactions of particles with detector material. To take into account the strong dependence of the background level on the separation from the beam axis, different selection criteria are used in different bins of R xy , and the final fit is performed in bins of this variable.",

The L0 requires a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. In order to reduce the processing time of the subsequent trigger stages, events with a large hit multiplicity in the SPD are discarded. The software stage is divided into two parts, which for this analysis differ between the 2011 and 2012 data. In the 2011 sample, the first software stage (HLT1) requires a single highp T track with a large impact parameter. The HLT1 selection for the 2012 sample was complemented with a two-track vertex signature with looser track quality criteria, in order to improve the efficiency at large displacements. At the second stage of the software trigger (HLT2), events are required to pass either a dedicated inclusive displaced-vertex selection or a standard topological B decay selection, which requires a two-, three-or four-track vertex with a significant displacement from all PVs [30]. The inclusive displaced-vertex selection uses an algorithm similar to that used for the LHCb primary vertex reconstruction [31]. A combination of requirements on the minimum number of tracks in the vertex (at least four), the distance R xy of the vertex to the beam axis (at least 0.4 mm), the invariant mass of the particles associated with the vertex (at least 2 GeV/c 2 ) and the scalar sum p T of the tracks that form the vertex (at least 3 GeV/c), is used to define a set of trigger selections with sufficiently low rate.",

For events selected only by the topological B trigger, a modified version of the algorithm is run on the output of the offline reconstruction with the following criteria: vertices with 0.4 < R xy < 1 mm must have at least eight tracks and the invariant mass of the system must exceed 10 GeV/c 2 , vertices with 1 < R xy < 5 mm must have at least six tracks, and those with R xy > 5 mm must have at least five tracks.

A requirement on m/m corr is preferred over one on the angle \u03b8 itself, since its efficiency depends less strongly on the boost and the mass of the candidate [35]. The second criterion is that the kinematic separation of the jets should satisfy R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 2.2, where \u03b7 and \u03c6 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle differences between the two jets, respectively. This reduces the tail in the dijet invariant mass distribution by suppressing the remaining back-to-back dijet background. The overall efficiency to reconstruct and select displaced \u03c0 v decays in the simulated samples is summarized in Table  1 for the 2011 and 2012 data taking conditions. A large part of the inefficiency is due to the detector acceptance, which is about 13% (8%) and 6.5% (5.5%) for \u03c0 v particles with a lifetime of 10 ps (100 ps) and masses of 25 and 50 GeV/c 2 , respectively. Other important contributions are due to the selection on the displacement from the beamline, requirements on the minimum number of tracks forming the vertex, the material interaction veto, the reduction in VELO tracking efficiency at large displacements, and the jet selection [36]. The efficiency for long-lived particles decaying to s-and cquark pairs is higher than for decays to b-quark pairs due to the larger number of tracks originating directly from the \u03c0 v decay vertex.",

The jet angles with respect to the beam direction are smeared independently in the horizontal and vertical planes by about one third of the resolution, which is the largest value compatible with the comparison of data and simulation in Z + jet events. The systematic uncertainty related to the L0 trigger selection consists of two parts, due to differences in the L0 calorimeter trigger response between data and simulation, and due to the difference between data and simulation in the distribution of the SPD hit multiplicity N SPD . The first is evaluated by studying the L0 calorimeter trigger response on jets reconstructed in Z + jet events, where the trigger decision is made based on the Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay products, and is independent of the jet.

The particles are assumed to be pair-produced in the decay of a 125 GeV/c 2 Standard-Model-like Higgs boson and to decay into two jets. Besides decays to bb, which are the best motivated in the context of hidden-valley models [1,2], also decays to cc and ss quark pairs are considered. No evidence for so far unknown long-lived particles is observed and limits are set as a function of mass and lifetime. These measurements complement other constraints on this production model at the LHC [13,15]   ",
