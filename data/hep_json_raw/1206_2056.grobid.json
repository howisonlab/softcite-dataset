            "text": "In this paper we present results from a K 0 s K 0 s femtoscopy study by the ALICE experiment [1,2] in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV from the CERN LHC. Identical boson femtoscopy, especially identical charged \u03c0\u03c0 femtoscopy, has been used extensively over the years to study experimentally the spacetime geometry of the collision region in high-energy particle and heavy-ion collisions [3]. Recently, the ALICE collaboration has carried out a charged \u03c0\u03c0 femtoscopic study for pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. This study shows a transverse momentum dependence of the source radius developing with increasing particle multiplicity similar to the one observed in heavy-ion collisions [4]. The main motivations to carry out the present K 0 s K 0 s femtoscopic study to complement this \u03c0\u03c0 study are 1) to extend the transverse pair momentum range of the charged \u03c0\u03c0 studies which typically cuts off at about 0.8 GeV/c due to reaching the limit of particle identification, whereas K 0 s 's can easily be identified to 2 GeV/c and beyond, 2) since K 0 s is uncharged, K 0 s K 0 s pairs close in phase space are not suppressed by a final-state Coulomb repulsion as is the case of charged \u03c0\u03c0 pairs, 3) K 0 s K 0 s pairs close in phase space are additionally enhanced by the strong final-state interaction due to the a 0 /f 0 resonance giving a more pronounced signal, and 4) one can, in principle, obtain complementary information about the collision interaction region by using different types of mesons. The physics advantage of items 1) and 4) is to study transverse mass scaling, of the source size which is considered a signature of collective behaviour in heavy-ion collisions [3]. If m T scaling is present, the source sizes from different species should fall on the same curve vs. m T . Thus, comparing results from \u03c0\u03c0 and K 0 s K 0 s , particularly at very different m T , would be a good test of this scaling. Item 3) can be used as an advantage since the final-state interaction of K 0 s K 0 s via the a 0 /f 0 resonance can be calculated with a reasonable degree of precision. Previous K 0 s K 0 s studies have been carried out in LEP e + e \u2212 collisions [5,6,7], HERA ep collisions [8], and RHIC Au-Au collisions [9]. Due to statistics limitations, a single set of femtoscopic source parameters, i.e. radius, R, and correlation strength, \u03bb , was extracted in each of these studies. The present study is the first femtoscopic K 0 s K 0 s study to be carried out a) in pp collisions and b) in more than one multiplicity and transverse pair momentum, k T , range, where k T = | p T 1 + p T 2 | /2 and p T 1 and p T 2 are the two transverse momenta of the K 0 s K 0 s pair.",

The tracks used in this analysis were reconstructed using the information from both the TPC and the ITS; such tracks were also used to reconstruct the primary vertex of the collision.

The minimum-bias trigger required a signal in either of the two VZERO counters or one of the two inner layers of the SPD.

The correlation function was formed from the ratio of \"real\" K 0 s K 0 s pairs from the same event to \"background\" K 0 s K 0 s pairs constructed by event mixing of ten adjacent events. Bins in Q inv were taken to be 20 MeV/c which is greater than the average resolution of Q inv resulting from the experimental momentum resolution. Also, the enhancement region in Q inv of the MeV/c 2 ). This is the first observation of the decay of this meson into the K 0 s K 0 s channel in pp collisions. In order to disentangle the non-flat baseline from the low-Q inv femtoscopic enhancement, the Monte Carlo event generator PYTHIA [12,13] was used to model the baseline. PYTHIA contains neither quantum statistics nor the K 0 s K 0 s \u2192 a 0 /f 0 channel, but does contain other kinematic effects which could lead to baseline correlations such as mini-jets and momentum and energy conservation effects [4]. PYTHIA events were reconstructed and run through the same analysis method as used for the corresponding experimental data runs to simulate the same conditions as the experimental data analysis. The PYTHIA version of the invariant mass distributions shown for experiment in Figure 1 yielded similar S/(S + B) values. As a test, the K 0 s K 0 s background obtained from event mixing using PYTHIA events was compared with that from experiment. Since the background pairs do not have femtoscopic effects, these should ideally be in close agreement. A sample plot of the experimental to PYTHIA ratio of the background vs. Q inv is shown in Figure 3 for the range N ch 1-11, k T < 0.85 GeV/c. The average of the ratio is normalized to unity. It is found that PYTHIA agrees with the experimental backgrounds within 10%. The Monte Carlo event generator PHOJET [14,15] was also studied for use in modeling the baseline, but it was found to not agree as well with experiment as PYTHIA, and thus was not used. K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions in Q inv were formed from the data in four ranges: two event multiplicity (1-11, > 11) ranges times two k T (< 0.85, > 0.85 GeV/c) ranges. Event multiplicity was defined as the number of charged particles falling into the pseudorapidty range |\u03b7| < 0.8 and transverse momentum range 0.12 < p T < 10 GeV/c. The two event multiplicity ranges used, 1-11 and > 11, correspond to mean charged particle densities, dN ch /d\u03b7 , of 2.8 and 11.1, respectively, with uncertainties of \u223c 10%. PYTHIA events were used to estimate dN ch /d\u03b7 from the mean charged-particle multiplicity in each range as was done for Table I of Reference [4], which presents ALICE \u03c0\u03c0 results for pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, event multiplicity having been determined in the same way there as in the present work. This is convenient since the K 0 s K 0 s source parameters from the present work are compared with those from the \u03c0\u03c0 measurement below. About 3\u00d7 10 8 minimum bias events were analyzed yielding about 6\u00d7 10 6 K 0 s K 0 s pairs. A similar number of PYTHIA minimum bias events used for the baseline determination were also analyzed. This was found to give sufficient statistics for the PYTHIA correlation functions such that the impact of these statistical uncertainties on the measurement of the source parameters was small compared with the systematic uncertainties present in the measurement. The femtoscopic variables R and \u03bb were extracted in each range by fitting the experimental correlation function divided by the PYTHIA correlation function with the Lednicky parametrization [9] based on the model by R. Lednicky and V.L. Lyuboshitz [16]. This model takes into account both quantum statistics and strong final-state interactions from the a 0 /f 0 resonance which occur between the K 0 s K 0 s pair. The K 0 s spacial distribution is assumed to be Gaussian with a width R in the parametrization and so its influence on the correlation function is from both the quantum statistics and the strong final-state interaction. This is the same parametrization as was used by the RHIC STAR collaboration to extract R and \u03bb from their K 0 s K 0 s study of Au-Au collisions [9]. The correlation function is",

            "text": "K 0 s K 0 s correlations in ALICE ALICE Collaboration f (k * ) is the s-wave K 0 K 0 scattering amplitude whose main contributions are the s-wave isoscalar and isovector f 0 and a 0 resonances [9], R is the radius parameter and \u03bb is the correlation strength parameter (in the ideal case of pure quantum statistics \u03bb = 1). \u03b1 is the fraction of K 0 s K 0 s pairs that come from the K 0 K 0 system which is set to 0.5 assuming symmetry in K 0 and K 0 production [9]. As seen in Eq. (2), the first term is the usual Gaussian from quantum statistics and the second term describes the final-state resonance scattering and both are sensitive to the radius parameter, R, giving enhanced sensitivity to this parameter. The scattering amplitude, f (k * ), depends on the resonance masses and decay couplings which have been extracted in various experiments [9]. The uncertainties in these are found to have only a small effect on the extraction of R and \u03bb in the present study. An overall normalization parameter multiplying Eq. (1) is also fit to the experimental correlation function. Figure 4 shows the experimental and PYTHIA K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions for each of the four multiplicityk T ranges used. Whereas the experimental correlation functions show an enhancement for Q inv < 0.3 GeV/c 2 , the PYTHIA correlation functions do not show a similar enhancement. This is what would be expected if the experimental correlation functions contain femtoscopic correlations since PYTHIA does not contain these. PYTHIA is seen to describe the experimental baseline rather well in the region Q inv > 0.4 GeV/c 2 where it is expected that effects of femtoscopic correlations are insignificant. Figure 5 shows the experimental correlation functions divided by the PYTHIA correlation functions from Figure 4 along with the fits with the Lednicky parametrization from Eqs. (1)- (3). The fits are seen to qualitatively describe the correlation functions within the error bars, which are statistical. Table 1 present the results of this study for \u03bb and R parameters extracted by fitting the Lednicky parametrization to K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions as shown in Figure 5. The source parameters are plotted versus m T = k T 2 + m 2 K to observe whether m T scaling is present (as discussed earlier) and statistical + systematic error bars are shown. The statistical uncertainties include both the experimental and the PYTHIA statistical uncertainties used to form the correlation functions, as shown in Figure 4. The largest contributions to the systematic uncertainties are 1) the non-statistical uncertainty in using PYTHIA to determine the baseline and 2) the effect of varying the Q inv fit range by \u00b110%. These were found to be on the order of or greater than the size of the statistical uncertainties, as can be seen in Table 1. The method used to estimate the systematic uncertainty of using PYTHIA was to set the PYTHIA K 0 s K 0 s background distribution equal to the experimental background distribution in the ratio of correlation functions, e.g. forcing the ratio plotted in Figure 3 to be exactly unity for all Q inv . The ratio of correlation functions then becomes the ratio of the experimental to PYTHIA real pair distributions, which is then fit with the Lednicky parametrization to extract the source parameters. Parameters extracted from these correlation functions were then averaged with those from Figure 5 and are given in Figures 6 and  7 and Table 1. This method is similar to that used in estimating systematic uncertainties in other K 0 s K 0 s measurements [6,8].",

Case 2) corresponds to the usual Gaussian parametrization for R and \u03bb . The results of these fits are shown in Table 2. Including the FSI term in the fit is seen to significantly reduce both R and \u03bb , i.e. R by \u223c 30% and \u03bb by \u223c 50%. The FSI is thus seen to enhance the correlation function for Q inv \u2192 0 making \u03bb appear larger and making the enhancement region narrower resulting in an apparent larger R. A reduction in R and \u03bb when including the FSI term was also observed, but to a lesser extent, in the STAR Au-Au K 0 s K 0 s study [9]. A larger effect of the a 0 /f 0 resonance on the correlation function in pp collisions compared with Au-Au collisions is expected since the two kaons are produced in closer proximity to each other in pp collisions, enhancing the probability for final-state interactions.",

In \u03c0\u03c0 studies the \u03bb smaller than 1 has been shown at least in part to be due to the presence of long-lived meson resonances which distort the shape of the source so that the Gaussian assumption, which the fitting functions are based on, is less valid [17]. This same explanation is possible for the   present \u03bb parameters extracted from the K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions. For example, the \u03c6 and K * mesons with full widths of \u0393 \u223c 4 and \u0393 \u223c 50 MeV/c 2 , respectively, could act as long-lived resonances compared with the extracted source scale of R \u223c 1 fm, the larger scales being unresolved in the first few Q inv bins but still depressing the overall correlation function.",

Also shown for comparison are R parameters extracted in the same event multiplicity ranges from a \u03c0\u03c0 femtoscopic study by ALICE [4] in 7 TeV pp collisions. Looking at the m T dependence first, the K 0 s K 0 s results alone suggest a tendency for R to decrease with increasing m T for both multiplicity ranges. The \u03c0\u03c0 measurements also show this decreasing trend for the high multiplicity range, but show the opposite trend for the low multiplicity range, R increasing slightly for increasing m T . Taken with the \u03c0\u03c0 results the K 0 s K 0 s results for R extend the covered range of m T to \u223c 1.3 GeV/c, which is more than twice the range as for \u03c0\u03c0. The lower m T points for K 0 s K 0 s which are in close proximity in m T to the highest m T points for \u03c0\u03c0 are seen to overlap within errors, showing m T scaling. The m T dependence of R combining both particle species is seen to be weak or nonexistent within the error bars. Looking at the multiplicity dependence, a tendency for R to increase overall for increasing event multiplicity is seen for both \u03c0\u03c0 and K 0 s K 0 s measurements as is observed in \u03c0\u03c0 heavy-ion collision studies [18]. The multiplicity-m T dependence of the pion femtoscopic radii in heavy-ion collisions is interpreted as a signature for collective hydrodynamic matter behaviour [3]. The corresponding measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV show similar behaviour [4]. However, important differences with heavyion collisions remain, for example the low-multiplicity m T dependence of R in pp for pions seems to increase with increasing m T rather than decreasing as with heavy-ion collisions, as already mentioned earlier. The interpretation of these pp results for pions is still not clear, although model calculations exist that attempt to explain them via a collective phase created in high-multiplicity pp collisions [19,20,21]. If such a collective phase is hydrodynamic-like, the m T dependence of the radii should extend to heavier particles such as the K 0 s as well, as shown in Ref. [21]. The measurements presented in this paper provide a crucial cross-check of the collectivity hypothesis. The interpretation is, however, complicated by the fact that in such small systems particles coming from the decay of strong resonances play a significant role [22]; simple chemical model calculations show that this influence should be relatively smaller for kaons than for pions. So far, no model calculations are known in the literature for any KK correlations in pp collisions for m T \u2265 0.7 GeV/c 2 , but the results measured in the present study should act as a motivation for such calculations.",

The femtoscopic kaon source parameters R and \u03bb have been extracted. The fit includes quantum statistics and final-state interactions of the a 0 /f 0 resonance. K 0 s K 0 s correlations show an increase in R for increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease in R for increasing m T as seen in \u03c0\u03c0 correlations in the pp system and in heavy-ion collisions. The universality of the m T dependence of the extracted radii, i.e. m T scaling, is also observed within uncertainties for the K 0 s K 0 s and \u03c0\u03c0 radii. ",
