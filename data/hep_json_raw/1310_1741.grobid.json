Using a data sample of 772 \u00c2 10 6 B \" B pairs collected at the \u00c7\u00f04S\u00de resonance with the Belle detector, we measure the ratio of branching fractions of the above suppressed decay to the favored decay B \u00c0 !

            "text": "Several hadronic weak decays related by the combined charge-conjugation and parity (CP) transformations exhibit different behavior. Such violation of CP symmetry is described by the Standard Model of particle physics via an irreducible complex phase in the 3 \u00c2 3 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix [1], which has elements V qq 0 , with q \u00bc u, c, t and q 0 \u00bc d, s, b. The unitarity triangle (UT) is used to represent the amount of CP violation parametrized by the CKM matrix. The UT angle 3 \u00bc arg \u00f0\u00c0V ud V \u00c3 ub =V cd V \u00c3 cb \u00de is less precisely measured compared to the other two angles 1 \u00f0 \u00de and 2 \u00f0 \u00de. The particular importance of improving the determination of 3 lies in the fact that it is the only CP -violating parameter that describes the UT that can be measured solely in tree-level processes. As a result, such measurements provide a benchmark to search for new physics contributions in loop-dominated processes that would otherwise constrain the UT. Various methods to determine 3 in the tree decay B \u00c0 ! DK \u00c0 , where D is a D 0 or \" D 0 decaying to a common final state [2], have been proposed [3][4][5]. In this paper, we focus on the Atwood-Dunietz-Soni (ADS) method [4] using the decay B \u00c0 ! DK \u00c0 followed by D ! K \u00fe \u00c0 0 . Several ADS measurements have been made using D ! K \u00fe \u00c0 [6][7][8][9][10]. However, given a significantly larger branching fraction for \" D 0 ! K \u00fe \u00c0 0 [\u00f013:9 AE 0:5\u00de%] than \" D 0 ! K \u00fe \u00c0 [\u00f03:89 AE 0:05\u00de%] [11], the former mode is potentially more sensitive to 3 despite a reduced acceptance owing to the presence of a 0 meson in the final state. Herein, we search for B \u00c0 ! \u00bdK \u00fe \u00c0 0 D K \u00c0 events for the first time in Belle, where the favored B \u00c0 ! D 0 K \u00c0 decay followed by the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) D 0 ! K \u00fe \u00c0 0 decay interferes with the suppressed B \u00c0 ! \" D 0 K \u00c0 decay followed by the Cabibbo-favored (CF) \" D 0 ! K \u00fe \u00c0 0 decay. The interference between the two amplitudes can lead to a large direct CP asymmetry between the suppressed decays. We use B \u00c0 ! D \u00c0 as a control channel because of the kinematic similarity to B \u00c0 ! DK \u00c0 and its much larger branching fraction.",

The neural network utilizes the following nine input variables: 1) the likelihood ratio of the Fisher discriminant formed from 17 modified Fox-Wolfram moments [20]; 2) the absolute value of the cosine of the angle in the CM frame between the thrust axis of the B decay and that of the remaining particles in the event; 3) the vertex separation between the B candidate and the remaining charged tracks along the beam direction; 4) the cosine of the angle between the direction of the K candidate from the D decay and the direction opposite the flight of the B candidate measured in the D rest frame; 5) the absolute value of the B flavor tagging dilution factor [21]; 6) the cosine of the angle between the B flight direction and the beam axis in the CM frame; 7) the cosine of the angle between the D and \u00c7\u00f04S\u00de directions in the rest frame of the B; 8) the product of the charge of the B candidate and the sum of the charges of all kaons not used for the reconstruction of the B candidate; and 9) the difference between the sum of the charges of particles in the D hemisphere and the sum of charges in the opposite hemisphere, excluding the particles used in the B meson reconstruction.",
