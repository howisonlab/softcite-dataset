ALICE is the LHC experiment dedicated to the study of nucleus-nucleus collisions and can study charmonia at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4) via the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channel and at mid rapidity (|y| < 0.9) via the e + e \u2212 decay channel. In both cases charmonia are measured down to zero transverse momentum. The inclusive J/\u03c8 production as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 and 7 TeV are presented. For pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the inclusive J/\u03c8 production as a function of the charged particle multiplicity, the inclusive J/\u03c8 polarization at forward rapidity and the J/\u03c8 prompt to non-prompt fraction are discussed.",

            "text": "Charmonia suppression via color-screening of the heavy-quark potential was originally proposed as a probe of the QCD matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in 1986 [1]. J/\u03c8 production was extensively studied at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Indeed, J/\u03c8 suppression in most central heavy-ion collisions was observed over a large energy range (\u2248 20 to 200 GeV/c). The LHC has opened a new energy regime for the study of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions. In a Pb-Pb collision at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, an average of one J/\u03c8 particle is expected to be produced in every central Pb-Pb collision, together with about 100 cc pairs. Several models [2,3,4,5] have included, already at RHIC energy, a J/\u03c8 regeneration component from deconfined charm quarks in the medium which counteracts the J/\u03c8 suppression in a QGP. At LHC, this regeneration component may become important, even dominant. The in-medium modification of the J/\u03c8 production can be quantified with the nuclear modification factor R AA , defined as the J/\u03c8 yield measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions divided by the yield measured in pp collisions and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions occurring in the nucleus-nucleus collision. To interpret the R AA , one must keep in mind the following points. First, prompt J/\u03c8 production in hadronic interactions consists of the sum of direct J/\u03c8 (\u2248 65%) and excited cc states such as \u03c7 c and \u03c8(2S) (\u2248 35%). Since the \u03c7 c and \u03c8(2S) have lower dissociation temperatures than the J/\u03c8, a J/\u03c8 R AA measurement around 0.65 is compatible within errors with the suppression of excited states only. In addition to these prompt J/\u03c8 one should also take into account that a nonprompt component from beauty hadron decays is present at LHC energy. The R AA includes cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, dominated by nuclear absorption and (anti-) shadowing. These CNM effects can be responsible for J/\u03c8 suppression independently from the creation of a deconfined medium. To quantify CNM effects, proton-nucleus collisions are needed. At SPS energy, the observed J/\u03c8 suppression would be compatible with the dissociation of excited states, once the CNM effects are taken into account. At RHIC, a J/\u03c8 R AA of \u2248 0.25 in most central Au-Au collisions was measured by the PHENIX experiment [6] with a strong centrality dependence. After estimating the correction due to the CNM effects, the suppression of direct J/\u03c8 is at least \u2248 40% or more. At the LHC, J/\u03c8 are abundantly produced and detailed studies of its production are possible in both elementary and heavy-ion collisions, such as azimuthal asymmetry, polarization, R AA dependence on rapidity and on transverse momentum, etc. Such studies may give us some answers about the balance between suppression and recombination mechanisms of J/\u03c8.",

When heavy-ions collide at finite impact parameter (non-central collisions), the geometrical overlap region and therefore the initial matter distribution is anisotropic and is converted into a momentum anisotropy of the produced particles. The possible onset of J/\u03c8 production via recombination mechanisms should be, according to models, accompanied with a non-zero or possibly large v 2 value [7] at low p T . Indeed, if charm quarks reach some level of thermalization in the medium, they may acquire an elliptic flow that can be further transferred to the J/\u03c8 assuming the J/\u03c8 is formed via recombination.",

The ITS consists of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors; at a radius 3.9 and 7.6 cm, the first two layers are equipped with silicon pixels (SPD), then two layers of silicon drifts at radius 15 and 23.9 cm and finally, two layers of silicon strips at radius 38 and 43 cm. Its main tasks are the primary and secondary vertex reconstruction; the resolution on the primary vertex ranges from 100 \u00b5m (pp collisions) to 10 \u00b5m (central Pb-Pb collisions). The SPD has triggering capabilities and can provide a signal at level 0. The large cylindrical TPC has full azimuthal coverage and extends from z = -2.50 m to z = 2.50 m 1 . The TPC radial coverage ranges from r = 85 cm to r = 247 cm. This large drift detector is the main track reconstruction device at central rapidity since it can provide up to 159 space points per track. Particle identification (PID) is achieved via the measurement of the specific energy loss (dE/dx) of particles in the detector gas (Ne/CO 2 /N 2 ). The excellent dE/dx resolution of \u2248 5% allows to identify electrons by using inclusion cut around the Bethe-Bloch fit for electrons and exclusion cuts for protons and pions. ALICE has further capabilities to improve electron identification and triggering thanks to the Time-Of-Flight (TOF), the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCAL) detectors. However, these detectors have not been used in the analysis presented here.",

It is defined as the logical OR of the three following conditions: (i) a signal in two readout chips in the outer layer of the SPD, (ii) a signal in VZERO-A, (iii) a signal in VZERO-C. This MB trigger requires the coincidence of the crossing of two proton bunches at the experiment interaction point (IP). ALICE MB trigger selects about 86% of the proton-proton inelastic cross section. Specific cross sections were measured during van der Meer scan in pp collisions at 7 and 2.76 TeV and allowed to determine the absolute normalization of the inclusive J/\u03c8 cross section. The muon minimum bias trigger (\u00b5-MB) requires, in addition to the MB conditions given above, a signal in the MTR system. The MTR can reconstruct a trigger track, determine its p T and select different thresholds (p T \u2248 0.5, 1 and 4 GeV/c). The \u00b5-MB trigger helps to take advantage of the full luminosity delivered by the LHC in the muon spectrometer. The MB trigger used in Pb-Pb collisions collected in 2010 requires the logical AND of the conditions (i),(ii) and (iii) given above. The centrality of the collision is determined from the amplitude of the VZERO signal fitted with a geometrical-Glauber model [9]. In 2011, the MB conditions were reduced to the AND of conditions (ii) and (iii) but additional requirements were added to select rare events. In particular, event multiplicity and dimuon triggers were added and ZDC were used for rejecting electromagnetic Pb-Pb interactions and satellite Pb-Pb collisions.

Since the center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collisions is identical to the one of the Pb-Pb collisions, this analysis provides an essential reference data to measure the J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor. The integrated luminosity for the analysis is L int \u2248 20 (1) nb \u22121 in the dimuon (dielectron) channel. The integrated cross sections are \u03c3 J/\u03c8 (|y| < 0.9) = 6.71 \u00b1 1.24(stat.) \u00b1 1.22(syst.) +1.01 \u22121.41 (syst.pol.) \u00b5b and \u03c3 J/\u03c8 (2.5 < y < 4.) = 3.34 \u00b1 0.13(stat.) \u00b1 0.28(syst.) +0.53 \u22121.07 (syst.pol.) \u00b5b. Note that the uncertainties quoted here on the pp measurement are one of the main source of uncertainty of the nuclear modification factor discussed in the next section. The differential cross sections d 2 \u03c3/dp T dy have been extracted down to p T = 0 at both rapidities. These results are compared to a theoretical model, NRQCD calculation that includes Color Singlet and Color Octet terms at NLO, which describes reasonably well the measurement at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and also the one at \u221a s = 7 TeV [12]. In the previous results, one could remark that the J/\u03c8 cross section has a large uncertainty related to the unknown polarization. ALICE has studied J/\u03c8 polarization in pp collisions \u221a s = 7 TeV in the dimuon channel. Measurements of the polar and azimuthal angle distributions of the decay muons allowed us to extract the J/\u03c8 polarization for 2 < p T < 8 GeV/c and 2.5 < y < 4. The parameters describing the J/\u03c8 polarizations are consistent with zero in the kinematic range under study [13]. This measurement is, at the present date, the only J/\u03c8 polarization measurement at the LHC. It is crucial in the near future to extend the polarization measurement down to zero p T and to high p T in order to provide more stringent tests to theoretical calculations. In addition, since the pp cross section enters the nuclear modification factor calculation, the polarization, if different from zero, may have a strong impact at low transverse momentum. Such a measurement needs a large statistic and strengthens the requirement to collect a large amount of data at the same center of mass energy as the Pb-Pb collisions.",

            "text": "An interesting feature of the J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV arises from its dependence on the charged particle multiplicity. The dN ch /d\u03b7 is calculated from the number of tracks reconstructed in |\u03b7| < 1 using pairs of hits (tracklets) in the SPD. These measurements were performed at both rapidities in the dimuon and dielectron channels. Expressed in terms of the relative J/\u03c8 yield dN J/\u03c8 /d\u03b7 dN J/\u03c8 /d\u03b7 as a function of the relative charged multiplicity dN ch /d\u03b7 dN ch /d\u03b7 , a linear increase is clearly seen at both rapidities. For dN ch /d\u03b7/ dN ch /d\u03b7 = 4 (\u2248 24/6), the relative J/\u03c8 yield is enhanced by a factor of about 5 at forward rapidity and about 8 at mid rapidity. This trend is not reproduced by PYTHIA 6.4.25 in the Perugia 2011 tune which exhibits an opposite tendency, i.e. a decrease of the J/\u03c8 multiplicity with respect to the event multiplicity [14]. One could infer that the J/\u03c8 production is strongly connected with the underlying hadronic activity. Whether this hadronic activity comes from multiple parton interactions remains an open question. Further investigations are needed to better understand this measurement that challenges our understanding of the J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions. In particular, the event multiplicity dependence should be completed by the p T dependence and extended to the open charm cross section (e.g. D mesons).",

            "text": "All the results presented up to now refer to inclusive J/\u03c8 production which sums three distinct contributions: the prompt J/\u03c8 produced directly in the pp collisions, the prompt J/\u03c8 produced indirectly via the decay of heavier charmonia states and the non-prompt J/\u03c8 produced in the decay of beauty hadrons. At central rapidity (|y| < 0.9), the measurement of the non-prompt J/\u03c8 was achieved in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV for 1.3 < p T < 10 GeV/c. This measurement is only accessible in ALICE since the other experiments cannot detect J/\u03c8 at mid rapidity below a p T of 6.5 GeV/c where most of the cross section lies. The integrated luminosity for the analysis is L int = 5.6nb \u22121 . This measurement relies on the discrimination of J/\u03c8 produced detached from the primary vertex of the pp collisions thanks to the good spatial resolution of the ITS. By fitting simultaneously the invariant mass spectra and the pseudoproper decay length of the reconstructed J/\u03c8, one can can measure the relative abundances of prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8, and the background. The fraction of J/\u03c8 from beauty hadrons ( f B ) in the measured kinematic range is about 15% with a strong p T dependence. Then, f B is combined with the the inclusive J/\u03c8 cross section measured in [11] to extract the prompt J/\u03c8 cross section \u03c3 prompt J/\u03c8 (|y| < 0.9, p T > 1.3 GeV/c) = 7.2 \u00b1 0.7(stat.) \u00b1 1.0(syst.) +1.3 \u22121.2 (syst.pol.) \u00b5b. Comparisons with models lead to a good description of the prompt J/\u03c8 dependence with p T and of the total beauty cross section [15].",

            "text": "Inclusive J/\u03c8 production was studied in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at mid and forward rapidity in the dielectron and dimuon decay channels using respectively an integrated luminosity L int \u2248 2.1 and L int \u2248 70 \u00b5b \u22121 . A crucial feature of the ALICE detector is to measure, in both channels, the J/\u03c8 production down to p T = 0 GeV/c. The large data sample analyzed in the dimuon channel allowed us to perform differential analysis of the nuclear modification factor (R AA ) as function of centrality, p T , and y. In the dielectron channel, only the centrality dependence in 3 centrality classes (0-10%, 10-40% and 40-80%) could be achieved. One should note that the acceptance times efficiency factor in the dielectron (dimuon) channel is quite high \u2248 8% (14%) and weakly depends on the collision centrality with a maximum relative loss of 12% (8%) from peripheral to most central collisions. Details on both analysis are given in [16]. On the left side of Fig. 1, the inclusive J/\u03c8 R AA is shown as a function of the number of nucleons participating in the collision [9] at mid and forward rapidity. At forward rapidity, a clear suppression is seen for N part > 70 with almost no centrality dependence. These results show a good agreement with the ones published in [17] based on L int \u2248 2.9 \u00b5b \u22121 collected in 2010. At mid rapidity, a similar pattern could be possible but the coarser centrality classes and larger uncertainties prevent to draw any firm conclusion. The centrality integrated J/\u03c8 R AA at forward and mid rapidity are R 0%\u221290% AA = 0.497 \u00b1 0.006(stat.) \u00b1 0.078(syst.) and R 0%\u221280% AA = 0.66 \u00b1 0.10(stat.) \u00b1 0.24(syst.). In both cases, the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the pp reference. On the right side of Fig. 1, the centrality dependence of J/\u03c8 R AA at high-p T is compared between ALICE and CMS [18]. A larger suppression, R AA \u2248 0.25\u22120.30, is measured in the most central collisions with a clear centrality dependence. One could see here an indication that the J/\u03c8 R AA is p T dependent at forward rapidity and possibly at mid rapidity; selecting high-p T J/\u03c8 drives down the R AA . The p T dependence of the J/\u03c8 R AA is confirmed and can be better observed in Fig. 2 (left side). The inclusive J/\u03c8 R AA is shown as a function of p T for the 0%-90% most central Pb-Pb collisions and exhibits a decrease from 0.6 to 0.35 approximately. At high-p T a rather direct comparison with CMS results [18] is possible; the only difference is that the CMS measurement covers a more central rapidity range (1.6 < |y| < 2.4). A reasonable agreement between the two measurements is found for high-p T J/\u03c8 R AA . For p T smaller than 4 GeV/c, the difference with PHENIX measurement [19] is striking. The PHENIX result concern the 0%-20% most central Au-Au collisions whereas the ALICE result is for a much wider centrality range (0%-90%). However, the bulk of the J/\u03c8 production (\u2248 60%) occurring in 0%-20% most central collisions, the comparison remains meaningful. In addition, work is ongoing to extract the R AA versus p T in smaller centrality classes.",

At forward rapidity, the J/\u03c8 R AA decreases by \u2248 40% from y = 2.5 to y = 4. The measurement at mid rapidity, because of its large uncertainties, does not allow to draw a clear conclusion but hints towards a rather flat behavior between y = 2.5 and y = 0. On the same figure, an estimate of the J/\u03c8 R AA due only to shadowing effects is given for two models. Indeed at LHC energies, modification of the gluon distribution function is dominated by shadowing effects [20]. The first model is a Next to Leading Order calculation within the Color Evaporation Model [21] with the EPS09 nuclear PDF (nPDF). The second model is a Leading Order calculation within the CS Model [22] with the nDSg nPDF. In the first model, the upper and lower limits correspond to the uncertainty of the EPS09 nPDF, and in the second model the band covers the uncertainty in the factorization scale of the for nDSg PDF. One could not exclude that shadowing effects are responsible for a large part of the J/\u03c8 suppression observed in R AA from y = 0 to y \u2248 3, this would imply that the expected color screening J/\u03c8 suppression observed at lower energy (RHIC) or higher p T (CMS) is either small or compensated by recombination mechanisms. In the rapidity range from 3 to 4, our results show that the suppression goes beyond the shadowing-only prediction given by models with our current knowledge of nPDF.",

The Statistical Hadronization Model [2,24] assumes deconfinement and a thermal equilibration of the bulk of the cc pairs. Then, charmonium production occurs only at phase boundary by statistical hadronization of charm quarks. The prediction is given for two values of d\u03c3 cc /dy since no measurements are available at this rapidity for Pb-Pb collisions. The two transport model results [25,26] presented in the same figure differ mostly in the rate equation controlling the J/\u03c8 dissociation and regeneration. Both are shown as a band that connects the results obtained with (lower limit) and without (higher limit) shadowing and can be interpreted as the uncertainty of the prediction. The model from Zhao & al. implements a simple shadowing estimate leading to a 30% suppression in most central Pb-Pb collisions. The charm cross-section d\u03c3 cc /dy at y = 3.25 is \u2248 0.5 mb and the J/\u03c8 from beauty hadrons is estimated at 10% and no quenching is assumed. The model from Liu & al. takes the shadowing from EKS98 and uses a smaller charm cross-section d\u03c3 cc /dy \u2248 0.38 mb. The J/\u03c8 from beauty hadrons is estimated at 10% and b quenching is fixed at R AA (b)= 0.4 for all the p T range. In both transport models, the amount of regenerated J/\u03c8 in the most central collisions contributes to about 50% of the production yield, the rest being from initial production. We can see on the left side of Fig. 3 that all three models reproduce correctly the centrality dependence of the forward J/\u03c8 R AA for N part > 70. A similar observation can be made for the mid rapidity results [16]. The p T dependence of the forward J/\u03c8 R AA is also successfully reproduced by the transport models, as shown on Fig. 3 right side. In addition, both models predict that a large fraction of J/\u03c8 from regeneration have a p T below \u2248 3.5 GeV/c.",

A non-null J/\u03c8 v 2 seems to be present at intermediate p T and would tend to vanish at low and high p T . Uncertainties are still too large to draw definitive conclusions, nevertheless we have a non-zero v 2 signal for J/\u03c8 with p T between 2 to 4 GeV/c with 2.2 \u03c3 significance. At lower energy, the J/\u03c8 elliptic flow was measured by STAR and appear to be consistent with zero at p T < 10 GeV/c in 20%-60% centrality range, whereas charged hadrons and \u03c6 exhibit a rather strong flow in this same kinematic domain [28]. Model prediction (private communication) for ALICE was provided by the authors of [26] and is shown on Fig. 4. The full line assumes a thermalization of the beauty quarks in the medium, for which there is no evidence so far, and should be considered as an upper limit. The dashed line, a more realistic prediction in which beauty quarks are not thermalized, shows indeed a non-zero J/\u03c8 v 2 , which matches qualitatively our data. It is important to add that this model reproduces successfully the ALICE J/\u03c8 R AA measurement.",

In pp collisions, the p T , y and multiplicity dependence of J/\u03c8 production, J/\u03c8 polarization and non-prompt J/\u03c8 have been studied. Results have shown good agreement or complementarity with other LHC results. All these measurements provide stringent constraints to model predictions. In Pb-Pb collisions, the J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor was studied as a function of centrality, p T and y. The J/\u03c8 R AA dependence on the number of participant nucleons is flat and centrality integrated values are large at mid and forward rapidity (\u2248 0.7 \u2212 0.5). This result is clearly different from the ones seen at lower energies (e.g. RHIC and SPS). The rapidity dependence of the J/\u03c8 R AA shows that suppression at large rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4 ) is beyond the one that could be expected from shadowing only predictions. The J/\u03c8 R AA is large at low p T and then decreases with increasing p T . The trends observed in the data as a function of centrality and p T can be reproduced by models based on deconfinement followed by charm recombination. In these models, J/\u03c8 from recombination mostly occur at low p T and account for half of the produced J/\u03c8 in the most central collisions.",

We have now accumulated hints that the J/\u03c8 production in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energy may be governed, for an important part, by charm quarks recombination processes. In order to confirm this observation, the shadowing must be measured and constrained since it remains unknown at LHC energies and this will be addressed by a pPb run scheduled at the beginning of 2013. One should add here that the uncertainties in J/\u03c8 R AA results depend directly on the pp reference data; thus it is crucial to collect a large amount of pp collisions at the same collision energy that of Pb-Pb sample, in order to have precise measurements of J/\u03c8 and charm differential cross section and J/\u03c8 polarization.
