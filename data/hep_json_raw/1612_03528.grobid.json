The presentations were organized as follows: heavy flavor production (Monday); heavy flavor decays (Tuesday); neutrino physics (Wednesday); mixing and CP violation (Thursday); spectroscopy (Thursday); and future experiments and facilities (Friday). Interspersed throughout the week were talks on searches for NP and theory talks. Experimental results were presented from ATLAS, ALICE, Belle, BaBar, BESIII, CDF, CMS, LHCb, PHENIX, and STAR. In this summary I discuss only a few highlights from among all these talks. For further details the reader is referred to the original presentations and these Proceedings.",

            "text": "The STAR experiment (Zhang) presented measurements [1] of the correlation function C(k * ) \u2261 A(k * )/B(k * ), where the variable k * is half the relative momentum between two particles produced in a collision, A(k * ) is the distribution for a pair of particles in the same event, and B(k * ) is the distribution for two particles produced in different events. If there is a net attractive interaction between the particles, C(k * ) increases as k * decreases; if there is a net repulsive interaction, C(k * ) decreases as k * decreases; and if there is negligible interaction, C(k * ) is independent of k * and equals unity. The STAR data corresponds to Au-Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV and is shown in Fig. 1(left). A strong attractive correlation is observed for both p-p andp-p distributions. Taking their ratio shows an equal attractive force over most of the k * range. However, at the lowest k * values the p-p attractive force appears to be stronger. More data is needed to confirm this effect. To measure a quantitative difference between p-p andp-p interactions and in this manner test CP T , STAR fits the p-p andp-p spectra for C(k * ) using the Lednicky and Lyuboshitz model [2]. The fit yields two parameters: the effective range of the interaction d 0 , and the scattering length f 0 . The latter indicates whether the interaction corresponds to an attractive bound state (f 0 < 0), an attractive but unbound state (f 0 > d 0 ), or is repulsive (0 < f 0 < d 0 ). The fit result is plotted in Fig. 1(right), which shows that d 0 and also f 0 are the same for p-p andp-p interactions, within errors. In both cases the range d 0 is approximately 2.5 fm, and f 0 corresponds to an attractive unbound state.",

All cross sections are measured as a function of p T and rapidity y and correspond to pp collisions at \u221a s = 7, 8 TeV. From measurements of D 0 , D ( * )+ , and D + s production, LHCb obtains a cc total production cross section of (2940 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 180 \u00b1 160) \u00b5b, where the first error is statistical, the second is systematic, and the last error is due to the c \u2192 D fragmentation model. From measurements of non-prompt J/\u03c8 production, i.e., events in which the J/\u03c8 candidate forms a secondary (rather than primary) vertex, LHCb calculates a bb total production cross section of (515 \u00b1 2.0 \u00b1 53.0) \u00b5b. This value is plotted in Fig. 2 along with measurements of \u03c3 bb presented by PHENIX (Haseler). The latter results are from three independent analyses: one using same-sign \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 pairs; one using opposite-sign e + e \u2212 pairs; and one using electron-hadron correlations.

A higher precision test of lepton universality was presented by LHCb (Hamilton), which measured the ratio of branching fractions R K \u2261 B(B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )/B(B \u2192 Ke + e \u2212 ). Within the Standard Model (SM), this ratio is within 0.1% of unity [8]. The measurement is challenging for LHCb due to the electrons. Photons reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter that lie close to the candidate electron's trajectory are added to the electron's four-momentum to improve the resolution; as a consequence, the signal shape for the Ke + e \u2212 mass distribution must be treated separately for one, two, or three \"recovered\" photons. In addition, the background shape depends on whether the event was electron-triggered, kaon-triggered, or passed some other trigger criterion; thus the different trigger streams are fitted separately. The result is R K = 0.745 +0.090 \u22120.074 \u00b1 0.036 for q 2 < (6 GeV) 2 , which is 2.6\u03c3 below unity.

The \u03b7 is reconstructed in both \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 modes, where \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The resulting M (\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) invariant mass distribution shows a clear peak near M \u2248 1835 MeV/c 2 , as expected, but it also shows a sharp drop at the pp threshold, which was unexpected. The observed lineshape including this drop is subsequently modeled in two ways: with a broad X(1835) state and a narrow X(1920) state (the latter being just above pp threshold); and with a broad X(1835) state and a narrow X(1870) state (the latter being just below pp threshold). Both parameterizations give satisfactory fits, which are shown in Fig. 9. Figure 9. BESIII sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decays. Left: fit result with a broad X(1835) state and a narrow X(1920) state. Right: fit result with a broad X(1835) state and a narrow X(1870) state. Both fits are satisfactory.",
