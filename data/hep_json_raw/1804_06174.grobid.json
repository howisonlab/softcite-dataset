Three benchmark signals are studied: a spin-2 graviton decaying into a Higgs boson pair, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and Standard Model non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Two analyses are carried out, each implementing a particular technique for the event reconstruction that targets Higgs bosons reconstructed as pairs of jets or single boosted jets. The resonance mass range covered is 260-3000 GeV. The analyses are statistically combined and upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs boson pairs times branching ratio to bbbb are set in each model. No significant excess is observed; the largest deviation of data over prediction is found at a mass of 280 GeV, corresponding to 2.3 standard deviations globally. The observed 95% confidence level upper limit on the non-resonant production is 13 times the Standard Model prediction.",

Two analyses, which are complementary in their acceptance, are presented, each employing a unique technique to reconstruct the Higgs bosons. The resolved analysis is used for HH systems in which the Higgs bosons have Lorentz boosts low enough that four b-jets can be reconstructed. The boosted analysis is used for those HH systems in which the Higgs bosons have higher Lorentz boosts, which prevents the Higgs boson decay products from being resolved in the detector as separate b-jets. Instead, each Higgs boson candidate consists of a single large-radius jet, and the presence of b-quarks is inferred using smaller-radius jets built from charged-particle tracks.",

The results are obtained using the resolved analysis for a resonance mass between 260 and 1400 GeV, and the boosted analysis for masses between 800 GeV and 3000 GeV. The main background is multijet production, which is estimated from data; the sub-leading background is tt, which is estimated using both data and simulations. The two analyses employ orthogonal selections, and a statistical combination is performed in the mass range where they overlap. The final discriminants are the four-jet and dijet mass distributions in the resolved and boosted analyses, respectively.

The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and straw-tube transition-radiation tracking detectors. An additional pixel detector layer [21], inserted at a mean radius of 3.3 cm, improves the identification of b-jets [22]. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements. A steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and includes three large superconducting air-core toroids. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m for most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and triggering chambers. A dedicated trigger system is used to select events [23]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses the calorimeter and muon detectors to reduce the accepted event rate to 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz on average.",

During 2016 data-taking, a fraction of the data was affected by an inefficiency in the online vertex reconstruction, which reduced the efficiency of the algorithms used to identify b-jets; those events were not retained for further analysis. This reduces the integrated luminosity of the 2016 dataset for the resolved analysis to 24.3 fb \u22121 . In the boosted analysis, events were selected from the 2015 dataset using a trigger that required a single anti-k t jet [26] with radius parameter R = 1.0 and with p T > 360 GeV. In 2016, a similar trigger was used but with a higher threshold of p T > 420 GeV. The efficiency of these triggers is 100% for simulated signals passing the jet requirements described in section 6, so the 2015 and 2016 datasets were combined into one dataset.",

For large-R jets, b-tagging is performed on anti-k t R = 0.2 track-jets [60] matched to the large-R jets using ghost association [61].

The observed and expected 95% CL upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio for the (a) narrow-width scalar, (b) bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 1 and (c) bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 2. An additional (red) curve shows the predicted cross section as a function of resonance mass for each of the graviton models. The drop in the predicted cross sections for masses below m (G KK ) = 350 GeV is due to a sharp decrease in the (G KK \u2192 HH) branching ratio.",
