The search is also sensitive to contributions from other production channels, such as W H \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb. In the absence of signal, we set limits at the 95% C.L. on the cross section for H production \u03c3(pp \u2192 H +X) in these final states. For a mass of MH = 160 GeV, the limit is a factor of 3.9 larger than the cross section in the standard model, and consistent with an a-priori expected sensitivity of 5.0.",

            "text": "The Higgs mechanism [1][2][3][4] accommodates the observed breaking of electroweak (EW) symmetry in the standard model (SM). In addition to generating masses for the EW W and Z bosons, as well as for fermions, the theory predicts a scalar Higgs boson (H) with welldetermined couplings, but unknown mass (M H ). Confirmation of the existence and properties of the H boson would be a key step in elucidating the origins of EW symmetry breaking. For a Higgs  tual when M H < 2M W . Previous searches [5][6][7] for this process were based on events with two charged leptons (\u2113) and large missing transverse energy ( E T ) from the decay H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192l\u03bd\u2113 \u2032\u03bd\u2032 (\u2113 = e, \u00b5). This Letter presents the first search for production of Higgs bosons with subsequent decay to W W having only one charged lepton in the final state. The data correspond to 5.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The largest SM contributions to the inclusive cross section for producing H bosons in pp collisions are from mechanisms involving the fusion of two gluons or two weak vector bosons into an H boson, and associated production of H and a weak vector boson (V = W or Z). In the following we will not distinguish between particles and antiparticles. The most striking signatures from H \u2192 V V decays are the all-leptonic 4\u2113 and 2\u21132\u03bd final states, but these account for only \u2248 5% of all decays. Final states containing a single charged lepton have larger backgrounds, but their branching fractions are a factor of \u2248 6 larger than for the all-leptonic modes.",

Our analysis is most sensitive to final-state topologies with a single charged lepton, two or more jets, and E T arising from H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u2113\u03bdq \u2032 q decays. For M H < \u223c 140 GeV, significant sensitivity is gained from the W H \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb channel, where we do not attempt to identify the b quark flavor. Smaller contributions from H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 \u2113/ \u2113qq, where / \u2113 represents an unidentified lepton, and H \u2192 W W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bdq \u2032 q with \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113\u03bd\u03bd, are also included. For M H \u2265 160 GeV, by assuming that the observed E T is due to the neutrino from the decay of a W boson, it is possible to reconstruct the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino (p \u03bd z ) up to a twofold ambiguity, and thereby extract M H from the W W decay [9]. We choose the solution with smallest |Re(p \u03bd z )| to calculate M H , resulting in the correct choice for \u2248 70% of signal events. The primary backgrounds are from V +jets, top quark and diboson production, and multijet (MJ) events containing a lepton or lepton-like signature, with E T generally arising from the mismeasurement of jet energies.",

Charged particle tracks are reconstructed using silicon microstrip (SMT) detectors and a scintillating fiber tracker, within a 2 T solenoid. Three uranium/liquid-argon calorimeters measure particle energies that are reconstructed into hadronic jets using an iterative midpoint cone algorithm with a cone radius of 0.5 [11]. Electrons and muons are identified through association of charged particle tracks with clusters in the electromagnetic sections of the calorimeters or with hits in the muon detector, respectively. We obtain the E T from a vector sum of transverse components of calorimeter energy depositions and correct it for identified muons. Jet energies are calibrated using transverse momentum balance in photon+jet events [12], and the correction is propagated to the E T . The data are recorded using triggers designed to select single electrons or muons and combinations of an electron and jets. After imposing data quality requirements, the total integrated luminosity is 5.4 fb \u22121 [13], where the first 1.1 fb \u22121 , Run IIa, precedes an upgrade to the SMT and trigger systems. The remaining 4.3 fb \u22121 is denoted as Run IIb. The four data sets: e or \u00b5 for the two run epochs, are analyzed separately and combined in the final result.",

These arise from a variety of sources, and their impact is assessed by changing each input discriminant to the RF by \u00b11 standard deviation. The most significant uncertainties affecting the normalizations are from calibration of jet energies (0.7-6)%, jet resolution (0.5-3)%, jet reconstruction efficiency (0.5-4)%, lepton identification and modeling of the trigger (4%), estimation of multijet background (6.5-26)%, and integrated luminosity (6.1%). Theoretical uncertainties on cross sections for backgrounds are taken from Ref. [20,23]. The uncertainties on cross sections for signal are taken from Ref. [24]. Because the overall cross section for V +jets production is constrained by data, the uncertainty on its normalization is anticorrelated with MJ background. The impact of theoretical uncertainties on distributions of the final discriminants are assessed by varying a common renormalization and factorization scale, by comparing alpgen interfaced with herwig [36] to alpgen interfaced with pythia for V +jets samples, and by varying the PDF parameters using the prescription of Ref.
