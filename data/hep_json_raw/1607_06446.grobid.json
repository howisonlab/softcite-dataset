By comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results one can verify and tune the parameters of theoretical models in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

The selection is then applied to the PIDcorrected simulated sample to estimate the efficiency. Systematic uncertainties originate from the determination of the signal yields, efficiencies, selection procedure and branching fractions. Since the final state is common for all considered decays, most of the systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratios. Imperfect knowledge of the invariant mass distributions for the signal and background causes systematic uncertainties in the signal yield determination, the mass difference and width measurements. The contribution from the fit model is studied by using alternative shapes for the B + component, for the [cc] states and for the background. For the B + signal shape, a Gaussian PDF with powerlaw tails on both sides and the sum of two Gaussian PDFs with power-law tails are used as alternatives to the Apollonios PDF. The combinatorial background component in the pp K + invariant mass is parameterised using a linear PDF. The effect of removing the peaking background due to misidentified B + \u2192 pp\u03c0 + decays is investigated by checking the variation of the ratio of the branching fractions by including or neglecting this component in the fit. Incorrect modelling of the partially reconstructed background can also introduce a systematic uncertainty. This is estimated by removing the ppK + invariant mass fit range below 5.20 GeV in order to exclude its contribution. In the fit to the pp spectrum, for the J /\u03c8 signal, the Apollonios PDF is used as an alternative to the sum of two Gaussian PDFs. The range of the pp invariant mass spectrum is also varied. The systematic uncertainty due to the variation of the fit range gives a negligible contribution to the Systematic uncertainties in units of 10 \u22124 on the \u03b7 c (2S), X(3872) and \u03c8 (3770) branching fraction measurements relative to that of the J /\u03c8 .

The largest variation in the ratio of the branching fractions due to the fit model is assigned as the corresponding systematic uncertainty. Possible biases related to the signal selection criteria are investigated by varying the BDT requirement and by checking the effect on the branching fraction ratio and on the efficiency ratio, after accounting for statistical fluctuations. The maximum variation in the ratio of the yields or the maximum variation in the mass difference and width measurements are considered as an estimate of the corresponding source of systematic uncertainty. In addition, variations in the procedure used to determine the PID efficiency and the uncertainty due to the finite size of the simulated samples, lead to an uncertainty on the efficiency ratio in the branching fractions evaluation. The total systematic uncertainties on the relative branching fraction measurements, determined by adding the individual contributions in quadrature, are listed in Table 2.",

In order to have accurate mass measurements, a calibration is applied to the momenta of the final-state particles.Large samples of B + \u2192 J /\u03c8 K + decays with J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 are used to calibrate the momentum scale of the spectrometer[27].Possible reflections due to B + \u2192 p\u00af \u2192 ppK + decays are inves-tigated using simulations, which show that no narrow structures are induced in the pp spectrum. Six charmonium resonances are included in the nominal fit to the pp invariant mass spectrum:\u03b7 c (1S), J /\u03c8 , \u03c7 c0 , \u03c7c1 , \u03b7 c (2S) and \u03c8(2S). Alternative fits including the \u03c8(3770) or the X(3872) resonances are performed in order to estimate upper limits on their branching fractions. The J /\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) peaks are parameterised with a double Gaussian PDF. The \u03b7 c (1S), \u03b7 c (2S), \u03c7 c0 and \u03c8(3770) shapes are modelled with a relativistic Breit-Wigner PDF convolved with a Gaussian PDF. The X(3872) and the \u03c7 c1 are described with a Gaussian PDF since their natural width is much smaller than mass resolution. Due to the B + mass constraint in the vertex fit, the pp mass resolution is effectively constant in the entire pp spectrum. The mass resolution parameter, common to all the charmonium states, is found to be \u03c3 pp = (4.3 \u00b1 0.4) MeV, in good agreement with the simulations. The masses of the \u03c7 c0 , \u03c7 c1 , X(3872), \u03c8(3770) and X(3915) states are fixed to the known values [8]. The J /\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) peak positions (M J /\u03c8 and M \u03c8(2S) ), the mass differences (M J /\u03c8 \u2212 M \u03b7 c (1S) and M \u03c8(2S) \u2212 M \u03b7 c (2S) ), and the natural width of the \u03b7 c (1S) state ( \u03b7 c (1S) ) are free parameters and are obtained from the fit to the data. A Gaussian constraint to the average value for the natural width of the \u03b7 c (2S) is applied [8]. The pp non-resonant component is assumed to have no relative orbital angular momentum, J = 0. The fit includes a possible interference effect between the \u03b7 c (1S) state and the J = 0 non-resonant component. The amplitude is given by |A| 2 = |A non-res + f e i\u03b4 A \u03b7 c (1S) | 2 , where A non-res is the amplitude of the non-resonant component, A \u03b7 c (1S) is the amplitude of the \u03b7 c (1S) state, \u03b4 is the phase difference and f a normalisation factor. The shape of the non-resonant component in the pp mass spectrum follows a phase-space distribution [8]. The fit result is shown in Fig. 2. A zoom of the fit result in the range 3.55-4.00 GeV is shown by the inset in Fig. 2. Using Wilks' theorem [28], the statistical significance for the \u03b7 c (2S) signal is computed from the change in the best fit likelihood when omitting the signal under scrutiny, 2 ln(L S+B /L B ), where L S+B and L B are the likelihoods from the nominal fit and from the fit without the \u03b7 c (2S) signal component, respectively. The statistical significance for the \u03b7 c (2S) signal is found to be 6.4 standard deviations. No evidence for the \u03c8(3770) and X(3872)",
