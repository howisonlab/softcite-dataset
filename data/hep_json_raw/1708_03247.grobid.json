To cover a range of mass differences between the top squarkt and lighter supersymmetric particles, four possible decay modes of the top squark are targeted with dedicated selections: the decayt \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 into a b-quark and the lightest chargino with\u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 W\u03c7 0 1 , the decayt \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 into an on-shell top quark and the lightest neutralino, the three-body decayt \u2192 bW\u03c7 0 1 and the four-body decayt \u2192 b \u03bd\u03c7 0 1 . No significant excess of events is observed above the Standard Model background for any selection, and limits on top squarks are set as a function of thet and\u03c7 0 1 masses. The results exclude at 95% confidence levelt masses up to about 720 GeV, extending the exclusion region of supersymmetric parameter space covered by previous searches.",

Nevertheless, it is believed to be only a low-energy realisation of a more general theory. In its current form, it fails to explain several observations, such as the nature of dark matter, the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the stabilisation of the Higgs boson mass against radiative corrections from the Planck scale. These shortcomings could be remedied by the existence of new particles at the TeV scale, which motivates extensive searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",

The search utilises 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV. The top squark is assumed to decay into either the lightest chargino or the lightest neutralino. Depending on the mass difference between the top squark and the lighter SUSY particles, different decay modes are relevant. The decayst \u2192 t\u03c7 , where f and f are two fermions from the W * decay, is assumed to occur. In this search, f and f are a lepton and its associated neutrino. For each of these decay modes, shown by the diagrams in Fig. 1, a dedicated event selection is performed to optimise the search significance, as detailed in Table 1. The results of the searches are interpreted in simplified models [11][12][13] as a function of the top squark and lightest neutralino masses. Additionally, results are also interpreted in one phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) [14][15][16][17]  decay, top squark masses up to about 700 GeV have been excluded for a nearly massless lightest neutralino. For the same assumptions about the lightest neutralino mass, if th\u1ebd t \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay is dominant, top squark masses up to about 500 GeV have been excluded.",

Only events taken in stable beam conditions, and for which all relevant detector systems were operational, are considered in this analysis. The integrated luminosity of the resulting data set is 36.1 fb \u22121 , with an uncertainty of \u00b1 3.2%. This uncertainty is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [35], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Rapidity is defined as y = 0.5 ln E + p z / E \u2212 p z where E denotes the energy and p z is the component of the momentum along the beam direction.   Candidate events are required to have a reconstructed vertex with at least two associated tracks with transverse momentum p T > 400 MeV. The vertex with the highest scalar sum of the squared transverse momenta of the associated tracks is considered the primary vertex of the event.",

Only jet candidates with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8 are considered. Jets are calibrated as described in Refs. [41,42], and the expected average energy contribution from pile-up clusters is subtracted according to the jet area [43]. Additional selections are applied to jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 in order to reject jets produced in pile-up collisions [44]. The \"medium\" working point is used for the pile-up rejection, which has an efficiency of about 92% for jets produced by the hard scatter. Jets resulting from the hadronisation of b-quarks are identified using a multivariate b-tagging algorithm (MV2c10), which is based on quantities such as impact parameters of associated tracks and reconstructed secondary vertices [45,46]. This algorithm is used at a working point that provides 77% b-tagging efficiency in simulated tt events, and a rejection factor of 134 for light-quark flavours and glu-ons and 6 for charm jets. The jets satisfying the b-tagging requirements are referred to as b-jets.",

Cross-sections calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms were used for top quark production processes. For production of top quark pairs in association with vector or Higgs bosons, cross-sections calculated at nextto-leading order (NLO) were used, and the event generator cross-sections calculated by Sherpa (at NLO for most of the processes) are used when normalising the multi-boson backgrounds. In all MC samples, except those produced by Sherpa, the EvtGen v1.2.0 program [60] was used to model the properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. Additional MC samples are used when estimating systematic uncertainties, as detailed in Sect. 7. SUSY signal samples were generated from leading-order (LO) matrix elements with up to two extra partons, using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [61] event generator. The two-body signals used Pythia 8.186 [62] for the modelling of the SUSY decay chain, parton showering, hadronisation and the description of the underlying event. The three-body  [74] NNLO + NNLL [75][76][77][78][79][80]  and four-body signals were decayed with Pythia8 + Mad-Spin [86] instead. Parton luminosities were provided by the NNPDF23LO PDF set. Jet-parton matching was realised following the CKKW-L prescription [87], with a matching scale set to one quarter of the pair-produced superpartner mass. In all cases, the mass of the top quark was fixed at 172.5 GeV. Signal cross-sections were calculated to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-toleading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO + NLL) [67,88,89]. The nominal cross-sections and their uncertainties were taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorisation and renormalisation scales, as described in Ref. [68]. All two-, three-and four-body samples were generated assuming a 100% branching ratio into the respective final states.",

The MC samples were reweighted to the pileup distribution observed in the data. The MC samples were processed through an ATLAS detector simulation [97] based on Geant4 [98] or, in the case of ttt and the SUSY signal samples, a fast simulation using a parameterisation of the calorimeter response and Geant4 for the other parts of the detector [99]. All MC samples are reconstructed in the same manner as the data. Corrections derived from data control samples are applied to simulated events to account for differences between data and simulation in reconstruction efficiencies, momentum scale and resolution of leptons and in the efficiency and false positive rate for identifying jets resulting from the hadronisation of b-quarks.",

It is estimated from data with a method similar to that described in Refs. [101,102]. Two types of lepton identification criteria are defined for this evaluation: \"tight\" and \"loose\", corresponding to signal and baseline leptons described in Sect. 3. The method makes use of the number of observed events containing loose-loose, loose-tight, tight-loose and tighttight lepton pairs in a given SR. The probability for prompt leptons satisfying the loose selection criteria to also pass the tight selection is measured using a Z \u2192 ( = e, \u03bc) sample.

In CR 2-body tt Z and CR 2-body V Z , events with three charged leptons including one same-flavour opposite-charge pair with |m \u2212m Z | < 20 GeV are selected. In order to mimic the kinematics of the tt + Z events with invisible Z decays, a corrected E miss T variable, E miss T,corr , is defined by vectorially adding the momentum of the sameflavour opposite-charge lepton pair to the p miss T vector. In order to test the reliability of the background prediction, the results of the simultaneous fit are cross-checked in VRs which are disjoint from both the corresponding control and signal regions. Overlapping regions, e.g. CR 2-body tt and CR 2-body tt,3 j , are only included in independent background fits, so that no correlation is introduced. The expected signal contamination in the CRs is generally below 5%. The highest signal contamination in the VRs, of about 18%, is expected in VR 2-body tt,3 j for a top squark mass of 400 GeV and a lightest neutralino mass of 175 GeV.",
