The invariant mass distribution of the leading photon and jet is examined to look for the resonant production of new particles or the presence of new high-mass states beyond the Standard Model. No significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed and cross-section limits for generic Gaussian-shaped resonances are extracted. Excited quarks hypothesized in quark compositeness models and high-mass states predicted in quantum black hole models with extra dimensions are also examined in the analysis. The observed data exclude, at 95% confidence level, the mass range below 5.3 TeV for excited quarks and 7.1 TeV (4.4 TeV) for quantum black holes in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (Randall-Sundrum) model with six (one) extra dimensions.",

Prompt photons in association with jets are copiously produced at the LHC, mainly through quark-gluon scattering (qg \u2192 q\u03b3 ). The \u03b3 + jet(s) final state provides a sensitive probe for a class of phenomena beyond the Standard Model (SM) that could manifest themselves in the high invariant mass (m \u03b3 j ) region of the \u03b3 + jet system. The search is performed by looking for localized excesses of events in the m \u03b3 j distribution with respect to the e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch SM prediction. Two classes of benchmark signal models are considered.",

            "text": "The first class of benchmark models is based on a generic Gaussian-shaped mass distribution with different values of its mean and standard deviation. This provides a generic interpretation for the presence of signals with different Gaussian widths, ranging from a resonance with a width similar to the reconstructed m \u03b3 j resolution of \u223c 2% to wide resonances with a width up to 15%. The second class of benchmark models is based on signals beyond the SM that are implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and appear as broad peaks in the m \u03b3 j spectrum. This paper considers two scenarios for physics beyond the SM: quarks as composite particles and extra spatial dimensions. In the first case, if quarks are composed of more fundamental constituents bound together by some unknown interaction, new effects should appear depending on the value of the compositeness scale . In particular, if is sufficiently smaller than the centre-of-mass energy, excited quark (q * ) states may be produced in high-energy pp collisions at the LHC [1][2][3]. The q * production at the LHC could result in a resonant peak at the mass of the q * (m q * ) in the m \u03b3 j distribution if the q * can decay into a photon and a quark (qg \u2192 q * \u2192 q\u03b3 ). In the present search, only the SM gauge interactions are considered for q * production. In the second scenario, the existence of extra spatial dimensions (EDs) is assumed to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem [4][5][6]. Certain types of ED models predict the fundamental Planck scale M * in the 4 + n dimensions (n being the number of extra spatial dimensions) to be at the TeV scale, and thus accessible in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC. In such a TeV-scale M * scenario of the extra dimensions, quantum black holes (QBHs) may be produced at the LHC as a continuum above the threshold mass (M th ) and then decay into a small number of final-state particles including photon-quark/gluon pairs before they are able to thermalize [7][8][9][10]. In this case a broad resonancelike structure could be observed just above M th on top of the SM m \u03b3 j distribution. The M th value for QBH production is taken to be equal to M * while the maximum allowed QBH mass is set to either 3M * or the LHC pp centre-ofmass energy of 13 TeV, whichever is smaller. The upper bound on the mass ensures that the QBH production is far from the \"thermal\" regime, where the classical description of the black hole and its decay into high-multiplicity final states should be used. In this paper, the extra-dimensions model proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulous and Dvali (ADD) [11] with n = 6 flat EDs and the one by Randall and Sundrum (RS1) [12] with n = 1 warped ED are considered.",

In the ATLAS searches, limits for generic Gaussian-shaped resonances were obtained at 7, 8 and 13 TeV while a limit for QBHs in the ADD model (n = 6) was first obtained at 8 TeV. The ATLAS search at 13 TeV with data taken in 2015 was further extended to constrain QBHs in the RS1 model (n = 1). No significant excess of events was observed in any of these searches, and the lower mass limits of 4.4 TeV for the q * and 6.2 (3.8) TeV for QBHs in the ADD (RS1) model were set, currently representing the most stringent limits for the decay into a photon and a jet.

Most relevant for this analysis are the inner detector (ID) and the calorimeter system composed of electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters. The ID consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip tracker and a transition radiation tracker, all immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field, and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The electromagnetic calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter with accordion geometry. The calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two endcap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5 it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.8, an additional thin LAr presampler layer is used to correct for fluctuations in the energy losses in the material upstream of the calorimeters. The hadronic calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter composed of steel/scintillator tiles in the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7), while copper/LAr modules are used in the endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. The forward regions (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) are instrumented with copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimized for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. Surrounding the calorimeters is a muon spectrometer that includes three air-core superconducting toroidal magnets and multiple types of tracking chambers, providing precision tracking for muons within |\u03b7| < 2.7 and trigger capability within |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

The data are required to satisfy a number of quality criteria ensuring that the relevant detectors were operational while the data were recorded. Monte Carlo samples of simulated events are used to study the background modelling for the dominant \u03b3 + jet processes, to optimize the selection criteria and to evaluate the acceptance and selection efficiencies for the signals considered in the search. Events from SM processes containing a photon with associated jets were simulated using the Sherpa 2.1.1 [24] event generator, requiring a photon transverse energy E \u03b3 T above 70 GeV at the generator level. The matrix elements were calculated with up to four final state partons at leading order (LO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and merged with the parton shower [25] using the ME+PS@LO prescription [26]. The CT10 [27] parton distribution function (PDF) set was used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. A second sample of SM \u03b3 + jet events was generated using the LO Pythia 8.186 [28] event generator with the LO NNPDF 2.3 PDFs [29] and the A14 tuning of the underlying-event parameters [30]. The Pythia simulation includes leading-order \u03b3 + jet events from both the direct processes (the hard subprocesses qg \u2192 q\u03b3 and qq \u2192 g\u03b3 ) and bremsstrahlung photons in QCD dijet events. To estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with the background modelling, a large sample of events was generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) Jetphox v1.3.1_2 [31] program. Events were generated at parton level for both the direct and fragmentation photon contributions using the NLO photon fragmentation functions [32] and the NLO NNPDF 2.3 PDFs, and setting the renormalization, factorization and fragmentation scales to the photon E \u03b3 T . Jets of partons are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [33,34] with a radius parameter of R = 0.4. The generated photon is required to be isolated by ensuring that the total transverse energy of partons inside a cone of size R = 0.4 around the photon is smaller than 7.07 GeV + 0.03 \u00d7 E \u03b3 T , equivalent 2 to the photon selection for the data described in Sect. 4.",

A photon candidate is classified depending on whether the EM cluster is associated with a conversion track candidate reconstructed in the ID. If no ID track is matched, the candidate is considered as an unconverted photon. If the EM cluster is matched to either a conversion vertex formed from two tracks constrained to originate from a massless particle or a single track with its first hit after the innermost layer of the pixel detector, the candidate is considered to be a converted photon. Both the converted and unconverted photon candidates are used in the analysis. The energy of each photon candidate is corrected using MC simulation and data as described in Ref. [42]. The EM energy clusters are calibrated separately for converted and unconverted photons, based on their properties including the longitudinal shower development. The energy scale and resolution of the photon candidates after the MC-based calibration are further adjusted based on a correction derived using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events from data and MC simulation. Photon candidates are required to have E \u03b3 T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37 and satisfy the \"tight\" identification criteria defined in Ref. [41]. Photons are identified based on the profile of the energy deposits in the first two layers of the EM calorimeter and the energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter. To further reduce the contamination from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 or other neutral hadrons decaying into photons, the photon candidates are required to be isolated from other energy deposits in an event. The calorimeter isolation variable E T, iso is defined as the sum of the E T of all positiveenergy topological clusters [43] reconstructed within a cone of R = 0.4 around the photon direction excluding the energy deposits in an area of size \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.125 \u00d7 0.175 centred on the photon cluster.

Selected events are required to contain at least one primary vertex with two or more tracks with p T > 400 MeV. Photon candidates are required to sat-isfy the \"tight\" identification and isolation conditions discussed above. The kinematic requirements for the highest-E T photon in the events are tightened to E \u03b3 T > 150 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37. The E \u03b3 T requirement is used to select events with nearly full trigger efficiency [50] while the \u03b7 \u03b3 requirement is imposed to enhance the signal-to-background ratio. Moreover, an event is rejected if there is any jet with p jet T > 30 GeV within R < 0.8 around the photon. The presence of additional tight and isolated photons with E \u03b3 T > 150 GeV in events is negligible for both signal and background events, and therefore allowed.

            "text": "The parton-level Jetphox calculations do not account for effects from hadronization, the underlying event and the detector resolution. Therefore, the nominal Jetphox prediction is corrected by calculating the ratio of reconstructed jet p T to parton p T in the Sherpa \u03b3 + jet sample and applying the parameterized ratio to the Jetphox parton p T . In addition, an m \u03b3 j -dependent correction is applied to the Jetphox prediction to account for the contribution from multijet events where one of the jets is misidentified as a photon (fake photon events). This correction is estimated from data as the inverse of the purity, defined as the fraction of real \u03b3 + jet events in the selected sample. The purity is measured in bins of m \u03b3 j by exploiting the difference between the shapes of the E \u03b3 T, iso distributions of real photons and jets faking photons; the latter typically have a large E \u03b3 T, iso value due to nearby particles produced in the jet fragmentation. The purity is estimated by performing a two-component template fit to the E \u03b3 T, iso distribution in bins of m \u03b3 j . The templates of real-and fake-photon isolation distributions are obtained from MC (Sherpa) simulation and from data control samples, respectively. The E \u03b3 T, iso variable for real photons from Sherpa simulation is corrected to account for the observed mis-modelling in the description of isolation profiles between data and MC events in a separate control sample. The template for fake photons is derived in a data sample where the photon candidate fails to satisfy the tight identification criteria but fulfils a looser set of identification criteria. Details about the correction to the real-photon template and the derivation of the fake-photon template are given in Ref. [56]. To reduce the bias in the E \u03b3 T, iso shape due to different kinematics, both the real-and fake-photon templates are obtained by applying the same set of kinematic requirements used in the main analysis. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the E \u03b3 T, iso distribution of events within the range 1.0 < m \u03b3 j < 1.1 TeV, superimposed on the best-fit result. This procedure is repeated in every bin of the m \u03b3 j distribution and the resulting estimate of the purity is shown as a function of m \u03b3 j in Fig. 3. The uncertainty in the measured purity includes both the statistical and systematic uncertainties. The latter are estimated by recomputing the purity using different data control samples for the fake-photon template or alternative templates for real photons obtained from Pythia simulation or removing the data-to-MC corrections applied to E \u03b3 T, iso in the Sherpa sample and by symmetrizing the variations. The variation from different data control samples for the fake-photon template has the largest effect on the  T for the photon candidates in events with 1.0 < m \u03b3 j < 1.1 TeV, and the comparison with the result of the template fit. Real-and fake-photon components determined by the fit are shown by the green dashed and red dot-dashed histograms, respectively, and the sum of the two components is shown as the solid blue histogram. The blue band shows the systematic uncertainties in the real-plus fake-photon template. The last bin of the distribution includes overflow events. The vertical dashed line corresponds to the isolation requirement used in the analysis. The photon purity determined from the fit for the selected sample in the 1.0 < m \u03b3 j < 1.1 TeV mass range is 93% purity (4% at 1.0 < m \u03b3 j < 1.1 TeV). The measured purity is approximately constant at 93% over the m \u03b3 j range above 500 GeV, indicating that the fake-photon contribution does not depend significantly on m \u03b3 j . Figure 3 shows the m \u03b3 j distribution in data compared to the corrected Jetphox \u03b3 + jet prediction normalized to data in the m \u03b3 j > 500 GeV region.",

In order to account for the assumption that the corrected Jetphox prediction itself is a good representation of the data, the fit is repeated on modified samples obtained by changing the nominal shape to account for several effects: firstly, the nominal distribution is corrected to follow the envelope of the changes induced by \u00b1 1\u03c3 variations of the NNPDF 2.3 PDF uncertainty, the variations between the nominal NNPDF 2.3 and CT10 or MSTW2008 PDFs, the variation of the value of Stat. uncertainty the strong coupling constant by \u00b1 0.002 around the nominal value of 0.118 and the variation of the renormalization, factorization and fragmentation scales between half and twice the photon transverse momentum; secondly the corrections for the hadronization, underlying event and detector effects are removed; and finally the corrections for the photon purity are changed within their estimated uncertainty. The largest absolute fitted signal from all variations of the nominal background sample discussed above is taken to be the spurious signal. The spurious signal is evaluated at a number of hypothetical masses over a large search range. It is required to be less than 40% of the background's statistical uncertainty, as Table 3 Spurious-signal cross-sections (\u03c3 spur ), and the ratio of the spurious-signal cross-sections to their uncertainties (\u03b4\u03c3 spur ) and to the signal cross-sections (\u03c3 model ) for the three benchmark models.

Given the fit range determined by the spurious signal test, the search is performed for the q * (RS1 and ADD QBH) signal within the m \u03b3 j range above 1.5 (2.0 and 3.0) TeV, to account for the width of the expected signal.

The invariant mass distribution of the \u03b3 + jet system above 1.1 TeV is used in the search for localized excesses of events. No significant deviation is found. Limits are set on the visible cross-section for generic Gaussian-shaped resonances and on the production cross-section times branching ratio for signals predicted in models of excited quarks or quantum black holes. The data exclude, at 95% CL, the mass range below 5.3 TeV for the excited quarks and 7.1 (4.4) TeV for the quantum black holes with six (one) extra dimensions in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (Randall-Sundrum) model.
