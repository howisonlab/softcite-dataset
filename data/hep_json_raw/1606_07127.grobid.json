Distributions in kinematic variables based upon \u00b5 \u00b1 -track reconstructions are analyzed and compared for the two samples. The differential cross sections for muon production angle, muon momentum, and four-momentum transfer Q 2 , are reported, and cross sections versus neutrino energy are obtained. Comparisons with predictions of current neutrino event generators are used to clarify the role of the \u2206(1232) and higher-mass baryon resonances in CC pion production and to show the importance of pion final-state interactions. For the \u03bd\u00b5-CC(\u03c0 + ) (\u03bd\u00b5-CC(\u03c0 0 )) sample, the absolute data rate is observed to lie below (above) the predictions of some of the event generators by amounts that are typically 1-to-2 \u03c3. However the generators are able to reproduce the shapes of the differential cross sections for all kinematic variables of either data set.",

            "text": "Interactions of few-GeV neutrinos and antineutrinos with nuclei are of keen interest to present and future neutrino oscillation experiments, such as T2K, NOvA, DUNE, and HyperKamiokande [1][2][3][4]. In this energy region, charged-current single-pion production (CC(\u03c0)) competes with quasielastic scattering in terms of the total charged-current (CC) event rate observed in the near and far detectors of the neutrino oscillation experiments. In \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 CC scattering on nuclei, the nuclear medium enables directly-produced CC(\u03c0) states to morph into other final-state pion channels and into quasielastic-like scattering topologies as well. These cross-channel migrations involve energy transfer from the produced state to the struck nucleus, rendering the total final-state energy difficult to detect. In this way distortions are introduced into the reconstruction of neutrino energy E \u03bd , four-momentum transfer squared Q 2 , and hadronic invariant mass W . Obtaining precise knowledge of the observed CC(\u03c0) rates and relating them to the various ways that directly-produced states can feed into the final states actually observed, is crucial for continued progress in neutrino oscillation measurements.",

Through event selection, the charged pion sample of process (1) is dominated by \u03c0 + production. The data in Ref. [5] was presented in two different ways -a single-pion sample with W < 1.4 GeV and an n-pion sample with W < 1.8 GeV where n signifies one or more charged pions. The sample selection for the latter sample (same as the data presented here) is for a semi-inclusive process; X may include, in addition to the recoil nucleon, neutral pions, and other particles (nucleons and photons) released by nuclear de-excitation and final-state interactions (FSI). The neutral pion sample of reaction (2) is more nearly exclusive [6]. The sample is restricted to events having one and only one \u03c0 0 , with no visible charged tracks other than the \u00b5 + emerging from the primary vertex. The recoil system X is limited to the recoil nucleon plus de-excitation neutrons and photons. There is no limitation on the value of W .",

Here, W is calculated from the true muon kinematics and true E \u03bd . Consequently the charged pion sample is nearly identical to the n-pion sample in Ref. [5] and the neutral pion sample is slightly smaller than in Ref. [6]. The restriction on final-state hadronic mass serves to enhance the contribution of \u2206(1232) and N * resonance produc-tion relative to that from CC DIS processes. Moreover the hadronic mass selection, together with the requirement that a Michel electron be observed on a non-muon track from the primary vertex, isolates a subsample of process (1) that is more nearly a \u03c0 + production sample, as will be elaborated below.",

The resulting measurements are complementary to the pion kinematical distributions previously presented [5,6].

It consists of planes of polystyrene scintillator strips oriented perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the detector. The horizontal axis is inclined 3.3 \u2022 relative to the beam axis. There are three scintillator-plane orientations, at 0 \u2022 and \u00b160 \u2022 relative to the detector vertical axis, that provide X, U, and V \"views\" of interactions in the scintillator medium. The module planes alternate between UX and VX pairs, enabling 3-D reconstruction of vertices, charged tracks, and electromagnetic showers of neutrino events. Separation of multiple interactions within a single 10 \u00b5s beam spill is made possible by the 3.0 ns timing resolution of the readout electronics.",

The FSI are especially important for pions because of the very large pion-nucleon cross sections in the \u2206(1232) resonance region. In GE-NIE, an effective model for the FSI simulation is used in lieu of a full intranuclear cascade treatment. That is, pions can have at most one interaction on their way out of the nucleus [27]. This approximation works well for light nuclei such as carbon, the dominant target nucleus reported in this work. It is assumed that the pions produced inside the nucleus have the same pion-nucleus cross sections as beam pions, and so scattering data from beam-pion measurements [28,29] are used to model the interaction. The total interaction probability is determined by the pion-carbon total cross section. An interaction of a pion within the nucleus proceeds by one of four processes, namely pion absorption, inelastic scattering, elastic scattering, and charge exchange with probabilities according to the corresponding data. Kinematic distributions in the final state are set by algorithms that are fit to the corresponding pion-nucleus data.",

The present analysis benefits from updated flux calculations [21]. In addition, a flux constraint provided by the MINERvA \u03bd + e \u2212 scattering measurement [20] has been applied. The constraint derived from measurement of muon-neutrino elastic scattering on electrons yielded a fractional change of between 1-2% in absolute rate for the range 1.5 GeV < E \u03bd < 10 GeV. Larger changes arose from revision of the absolute fluxes downward by 11-12% upon constraining them to hadron production data and incorporating improved determinations of the beamline geometry [21]. Together, these changes resulted in an upward shift of absolute event rate for the neutrino (antineutrino) exposure of 13% (12%) averaged over the analyzed E \u03bd range. In each event sample, changes to energy dependence introduced by the updated fluxes are small; the changes are almost entirely in absolute magnitude for all results except for the neutrino energy cross section.",

Uncertainty from systematic sources slightly exceeds the statistical error for this sample. No single source dominates the systematic error. The largest contribution arises from the detector energy response, which is expected because the hadronic energy is measured by the energy deposited in scintillator layers. The uncertainty in the neutrino flux is smaller than was the case for Refs. [5,6], but it is still the second-largest source of uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with neutrino cross sections is somewhat smaller than the flux uncertainty. Figure 5b shows the cross-section uncertainties for muon momenta of the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample. For this sample, the the statistical uncertainty of the limited data set (dashed histogram) is larger than either the flux or cross-section uncertainties. The normalization of the background fit contributes 8% to the systematic uncertainty. Significant uncertainty arises from the misidentification of neutrons as photons. This source of error was evaluated by changing the neutron inelastic cross section within an error range based upon compiled measurements. A large fraction of the secondary \u03c0 0 in the background is estimated to arise from \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 charge exchange (CEX), for which the cross sections are poorly known. The effect of this uncertainty on our measurement is evaluated by changing the CEX cross section within its uncertainty of \u00b150% [28,35,36], and then re-measuring the cross sections. The uncertainty in the electromagnetic energy scale contributes 2.2% to the error budget, estimated from the fitted mean uncertainty of the data m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution.",

Muon production angle Figure 6 shows the differential cross sections as a function of polar angle, \u03b8 \u00b5 , with respect to the neutrino beam, for the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample (Fig. 6a) and for th\u0113 \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample (Fig. 6b). For both samples, the \u03b8 \u00b5 distribution peaks around 8 \u2022 and then decreases gradually. Beyond 25 \u2022 the acceptance into the MINOS near detector is small, and so no cross sections are given for that region. The superimposed solid-line (dashed-line) histogram shows the GENIE prediction that includes (omits) the intranuclear FSI treatment. The ratio of the predictions with/without FSI is observed to be roughly constant over the observed angular range. Fig. 6a,b shows that pion FSI play a significant role in the GENIE predictions. In the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample (upper plot), \u2206(1232) production in the charge state \u2206 ++ dominates the final state, and pion intranuclear absorption plus pion charge exchange deplete the number of final-state pions that exit the nucleus. This depletion cannot be compensated by charge-exchange feed-in from \u2206 + channels which are produced at lower rates (due to their smaller isospin amplitudes). Thus, for reactions (1), the GENIE prediction with FSI included is always smaller than the GENIE prediction without FSI. For reactions (2) of the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample however, the situation is reversed. The latter reactions also lose pions to intranuclear absorption and charge exchange. However, the feed-in of charge-exchanged \u03c0 0 originating from production of \u2206 \u2212 states is always larger than the losses. Production of the latter states benefits from having a relatively large isospin amplitude. The net result is that for reactions (2) the GENIE prediction is elevated by the inclusion of FSI processes (Fig. 6b).",

            "text": "Differences in absolute rate between the data and GE-NIE predictions are evident in Fig. 6a. The GENIE prediction with FSI (solid-line curve) is too high by 20% to 30% for the neutrino-induced sample of Fig. 6a. On the other hand, Fig. 6b shows the GENIE prediction with FSI to be in good agreement with the distribution for the antineutrino sample. The uncertainties associated with the absolute \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 fluxes are 8.5% and 8.0% respectively, so the data/MC normalization differences are of order 2.4 \u03c3 and 0.3 \u03c3. In Fig. 6 and in subsequent figures, predictions of the NEUT and NuWro neutrino event generators are displayed with FSI effects included, providing comparisons with GENIE as well as additional predictions for the data. For baryon-resonance production, NEUT (like GE-NIE) uses the Rein-Sehgal model [23] but without inclusion of baryon-resonance interference, whereas NuWro includes only \u2206(1232) production as formulated by the Adler model [38,39]. NEUT also incorporates nonresonant pion production from Rein-Sehgal, whereas NuWro (like GENIE) uses the Bodek-Yang model [26] above the resonance region and extrapolates it to lower W so as to converge with the predictions of Rein-Seghal. For their FSI treatments, both NEUT and NuWro use the Salcedo-Oset model [40] in a cascade formalism that includes nuclear medium corrections. The NEUT and NuWro predictions are compared to data for which the background estimates have been launched from predictions of the GENIE event generator. The GENIE predictions however are constrained by data in the sidebands; moreover the full systematics uncertainties arising from GENIE as well as other sources are taken into account in the predicted backgrounds. Consequently any biasing of measurements towards GENIE predictions will fall within the systematics error envelope indicated for the data points. Figure 6 shows that all three event generators achieve good agreement for the shape of d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 for both of the CC pion production samples. NEUT, like GENIE, predicts an absolute rate for the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample that is distinctly higher than for the data, while the NuWro prediction for the same sample is in excellent agreement with respect to distribution shape and normalization. For th\u0113 \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample of Fig. 6b, however, the situation is opposite: GENIE and NEUT achieve good agreement in normalization as well as shape, while the NuWro prediction falls well below the data. Normalization differences between data and predictions of event generators can be driven by cross-section uncertainties for \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 -induced pion production in scattering on free nucleons, as well as by flux uncertainties. The data constraining these processes are sparse, and in the case of \u03bd \u00b5 +p \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 +\u03c0 + +p, the two bubble chamber measurements using 0.5 to \u223c 3 GeV neutrinos reported cross sections that differed by \u223c 30% in absolute normalization [41,42]. (A recent reanalysis obtains consistency between these two data sets [43] , however the generator predictions shown here have not been tuned to the results of this reanalysis.) For the channel\u03bd \u00b5 +p \u2192 \u00b5 + +\u03c0 0 +n there is only one cross-section data point, obtained with antineutrino scattering on a heavy-liquid (freon CF 3 Br) bubble chamber fill [44].",

The distributions peak between 2.0 and 2.5 GeV and fall off rapidly as p \u00b5 increases from 3.0 to beyond 6.0 GeV. The same trends as observed in d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 are apparent here in d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 . The relatively large uncertainty for the lowest-momentum bin in Fig. 7a is an artifact of the muon acceptance in MINOS. Because muons with p \u00b5 < 1 GeV have low efficiency, the data selection requires E \u03bd > 1.5 GeV. Therefore, the first bin only receives event counts as the result of the unfolding procedure. Figure 7 compares the observed d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 distributions to predictions of the three event generators. Similar to the situation with d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 in Fig. 6, the three generators achieve good agreement with respect to the shape of d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 for both samples, but with variance in the predictions for absolute rates.",

The GE-NIE prediction, for example, consists of quasielastic scattering, baryon resonance production, non-resonant pion production, DIS, and coherent pion production. For the pion production samples of this work, the topology selections and W restriction ensure that the contributions from quasielastic and DIS scattering are negligible. The samples are predicted to be dominated by single-pion final states arising from production and decay of the \u2206(1232) and higher mass resonances, together with pion-nucleon non-resonant production.

Thus coherent CC(\u03c0) scattering is confined to the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample; production of single \u03c0 0 mesons cannot occur via CC coherent \u03bd/\u03bd scattering. Figure 8a shows coherent CC(\u03c0) scattering to be the only component process having a pronounced dependence on muon angle. The three dominant processes are spread fairly uniformly over the angular range, although the production of \u2206(1232) is predicted to gain prominence at very forward \u03b8 \u00b5 values. On the other hand, Fig. 9a indicates that all of the component processes, including coherent CC(\u03c0 + ) scattering, distribute broadly with respect to muon momentum.",

            "text": "Muon Momentum (GeV/c)  Fig. 7 for the \u03bd\u00b5 (a) and\u03bd\u00b5 (b) pion production samples, showing the decomposition of the GENIE predictions into component reaction processes. The component processes are seen to distribute fairly uniformly with respect to muon momentum. Figure 10 shows the cross sections as functions of neutrino (antineutrino) energy for the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample (upper) and for the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample (lower plot). Wor-thy of note is the difference in the ordinate ranges for the two plots. For the highest E \u03bd bin measured in each sample ( E \u03bd = 9.0 GeV), the cross section for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) is more than twice as large as the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) cross section. Also clearly discernible is the difference in the cross section rise-with-E \u03bd for the two samples. The cross section for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample (Fig. 10a) reaches its plateau at E \u03bd \u2265 3.0 GeV. However, the cross section for\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) (Fig. 10b), exhibits a gradual rise throughout the measured region 1.5 \u2264 E \u03bd \u2264 10.0 GeV. The relative trends are a manifestation of the underlying vector minus axial-vector (V \u2212 A) structure of the hadronic currents of these semileptonic weak interactions. Within the structure functions of antineutrino CC scattering, the V \u2212 A interference terms have opposite sign compared to corresponding terms in the structure functions of neutrino CC scattering. The V \u2212 A terms interfere destructively in the hadronic currents of \u03bd \u00b5 -CC scattering, whereas the interference is constructive in \u03bd \u00b5 -CC interactions. The interferences contribute significantly to the cross sections in the sub-GeV to few GeV range of E \u03bd and they account for the different trends in evolution with E \u03bd observed in Fig. 10a,b  [23]. Figure 10 compares the measured cross sections to the predictions of GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro. The predictions for all of these generators exceed the measured \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) cross section, with GENIE and NEUT exhibiting a much larger disagreement (Fig. 10a). For th\u0113 \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) cross section (Fig. 10b), there is less variation among the generator predictions and much better agreement with the data.  Figures 11a,b show the component reaction processes that are included in the GENIE predictions for cross sections of the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) samples, respectively. Notably absent are dramatic changes in the mixture of components with increasing E \u03bd . Although the \u2206(1232) resonance is expected to dominate at low E \u03bd in all models, its relative contribution would be expected to decrease at higher E \u03bd where more energy is available to excite the struck nucleon. The W cut at 1.8 GeV however mitigates such an effect. The pion non-resonant processes feature prominently in the GENIE predictions for both cross sections. The separation into resonant and non-resonant processes is model dependent and could be different in other models.",

Note the large difference in the ordinate scales for the two distributions in corresponding Q 2 bins. For the generator predictions displayed in Fig. 12, NEUT and GENIE use a relativistic global Fermi gas model for nucleon momentum, while NuWro uses a local Fermi gas model. The three calculations have very similar shapes for Q 2 > 0.2 GeV/c 2 . At the lowest Q 2 , it is possible that nucleon-nucleon correlations and Pauli blocking may contribute. These effects have been studied theoretically and experimentally in quasielastic neutrino scattering [46,47]. Other effects can modify the cross section in Q 2 bins below 0.20 GeV 2 . Recall that coherent scattering can contribute to \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) but not to\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ). By its nature, coherent scattering involves a very small fourmomentum transfer to the target nucleus and so its contribution is confined to very low Q 2 . Different models are commonly used; while NEUT and GENIE use different implementations of the Rein-Sehgal [31] model, NuWro uses the Berger-Sehgal [48] model. NEUT predicts a distinctly larger rate for coherent reaction (9) than does GENIE. Consequently the NEUT prediction (Fig. 12a) peaks near Q 2 0.0 GeV 2 , while GENIE and NuWro do not predict such an effect. In fact, GENIE and NuWro predict a mild turnover in d\u03c3/dQ 2 as Q 2 approaches zero GeV, in agreement with the turnover exhibited by the data. MINERvA has published total cross section data for coherent pion production [30] using the same initial data samples as the analyses presented here. The NEUT prediction for the total coherent cross section is much larger than those data, while the GENIE prediction roughly agrees with the measured cross section in both shape and absolute rate. Figure 13 shows the GENIE predictions for the sample compositions compared to the d\u03c3/dQ 2 data points. The three main reaction categories are predicted to distribute broadly over the range 0.0 \u2264 Q 2 \u2264 2.0 GeV 2 . The coherent scattering contribution to the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample is predicted to be mostly confined to Q 2 < 0.4 GeV 2 . At high Q 2 , the non-resonant processes in GENIE have a larger contribution to the data than the baryon resonance processes. In Figs. 13a,b the GENIE predictions exhibit the same trends as observed in Figs. 8, 9, and 11, namely good agreement with the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) data and an absolute normalization that is high relative to the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) data.

Stacked histograms (top to bottom) show contributions from \u03c0 \u2212 (for the charged pion sample), multiple-pion production with absorption, charge exchange (for the \u03c0 0 sample), inelastic scattering, elastic scattering, and no interaction. The full simulation, shown area-normalized to the data, reproduces the shape of data d\u03c3/dQ 2 without ascribing Q 2 -dependence to pion FSI. Figure 14 shows a decomposition of the GENIE predictions according to pion FSI processes. Here, the simulation has been area-normalized to the data to better examine whether shape effects are present that could be related to FSI. The information displayed is complementary to that shown in Fig. 13. While Fig. 13 gives the GE-NIE subdivision by the primary process, Fig. 14 shows the subdivision by what happens after the primary process. For the pion kinematic variables [5,6], the FSI processes are important in determining the shape of the distributions. However, for variables that are largely determined by form-factor dependence and the nuclear model (such as Q 2 ), pion FSI processes are expected to have a relatively mild affect. Referring to Fig. 12, the GENIEbased predictions that omit or include FSI (dotted versus solid curves), indicate that FSI processes reduce the differential cross section for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and elevate the differential cross section for\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ). The same trends are predicted by GENIE of the muon kinematic distributions of Figs. 6 and 7, and for the cross sections as functions of neutrino energy in Fig. 10.",

This could be due to longrange nucleon-nucleon correlations, usually treated via the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [46,47], or to Pauli blocking. Pauli blocking should be applied for nonresonant pion production. Pion production through an intermediate \u2206(1232) resonance should be subject to Pauli blocking, as \u2206(1232) decay deposits a nucleon into the residual nucleus. The net effect is suppression of reactions at very low Q 2 , similar to the suppression observed with neutrino quasielastic scattering. The Pauli blocking effect has been calculated for \u00b5 \u00b1 \u2206(1232) channels produced in carbon-like nuclei in Ref. [49]; the suppression is confined to Q 2 < 0.2 GeV 2 and to W < 1.4 GeV. The generator models shown here do not include any of these effects for pion production.",

Events with total hadronic mass W < 1.8 GeV are selected to emphasize the baryon resonance region. Together with the previous publications based on the same data sample [5,6], these measurements provide a broad picture of pion production for neutrino energies 1.5 -10 GeV wherein charged-current scattering from single nucleons is convolved with nuclear structure and pion FSI effects.

GENIE and NEUT predictions give much better agreement for th\u0113 \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) comparisons. On the other hand, the NuWro generator obtains agreement with the distributions for the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample, but predicts event rates that are generally low by up to 1.5 \u03c3 relative to the data for\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ). The differences in generator predictions arise from differences in the cross section for pion production on free nucleons [45], and from the treatment of FSI, which has significant uncertainties. In contrast to the assorted discrepancies for absolute rates, all three generators obtain respectable shape agreement with the full suite of differential cross sections.",

A correct description of these data requires accurate models for this multifaceted problem. Separate understanding of the three aspects (pion production from the bound nucleon, nuclear structure, and pion FSI) are important for interpreting events recorded by the neutrino oscillation experiments at long baselines. Fortunately, the complete data set allows for some separation of processes. The measurements illuminate shortfalls in current generators with respect to absolute rate predictions for coherent, resonant, and non-resonant CC production of pions. These results can guide the development of improved neutrino-interaction models that are important to the international effort to obtain precision measurements of neutrino oscillations using \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 beams.",

This Appendix presents distributions describing pion production kinematics for the two analysis samples. These figures represent updates to similar plots presented in the previous papers [5,6], reflecting the improvements in the neutrino and antineutrino flux estimates noted in Sec. II A.  16. Differential cross sections for the pion production angle with respect to the beam direction, d\u03c3/d\u03b8\u03c0, for the \u03bd\u00b5-CC(\u03c0 + ) (a) and\u03bd\u00b5-CC(\u03c0 0 ) (b) samples. As in Fig. 15, the data is compared to GENIE predictions without and with pion FSI effects included; marked improvement with the data is observed when pion FSI is taken into account (solid-line distributions). Figure 15 shows the flux-averaged pion kinetic energy for the charged pions of the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample (Fig. 15a), and for the \u03c0 0 of the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample (Fig. 15b). The kinetic energy ranges of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 are different because the maximum \u03c0 + energy is closely related to the detector depth. Figure 16 shows the polarangle distributions for the produced \u03c0 \u00b1 and for the \u03c0 0 of these samples. The data points depict the same signal obtained with the same procedures reported in the main text, including the restriction on the invariant hadronic mass, W < 1.8 GeV. For the\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample, the updated \u03c0 0 distributions are shown for the same energy range, 1.5 GeV < E \u03bd < 10 GeV, as is used for the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) sample. The quantity plotted for charged pions in Figs. 15a and 16a is same as in Ref. [5]. Events with one or more \u03c0 + or \u03c0 \u2212 are included. Although not a true cross section, it arises from the cross section definition, Eq. 7, when each event can produce one or more pions. Each charged pion contributes one entry to a histogram and the cross section is calculated as in Sec. IV B. Figures 15 and 16 show comparisons with GENIE, NEUT, and NuWro predictions; for both samples it is clearly seen that, for GENIE, the pion FSI treatment causes the simulation to move closer to the data. The main change in these updated results compared to the earlier ones is reduction of the large disagreement in ab-solute normalizations of the differential cross sections between data and GENIE-based predictions. This reduction comes about because the calculated data normalizations are now higher by 13% and 12% for the \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 event samples respectively as the result of revisions made to the flux estimates of the exposures as described in Sec. IV B. (Note that all pion distributions shown here are obtained using the W < 1.8 GeV selection; this cut was not applied in the \u03c0 0 distributions of Ref. [6].) Figures 15 and 16 show that the GENIE predictions are now closer to the data but still appear to be high, with the overall normalization difference exceeding 1\u03c3 in the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) data set.",
