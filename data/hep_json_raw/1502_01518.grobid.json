The search uses 20.3 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV data collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are required to have at least one jet with p T > 120 GeV and no leptons. Nine signal regions are considered with increasing missing transverse momentum requirements between E miss T > 150 GeV and E miss T > 700 GeV. Good agreement is observed between the number of events in data and Standard Model expectations. The results are translated into exclusion limits on models with either large extra spatial dimensions, pair production of weakly interacting dark matter candidates, or production of very light gravitinos in a gauge-mediated supersymmetric model. In addition, limits on the production of an invisibly decaying Higgs-like boson leading to similar topologies in the final state are presented.",

Since none of the known SM particles are adequate DM candidates, the existence of a new particle is often hypothesized. Weakly interacting massive particles are one such class of particle candidates that can be searched for at the LHC [24]. They are expected to couple to SM particles through a generic weak interaction, which could be the weak interaction of the SM or a new type of interaction. Such a new particle would result in the correct relic density values for non-relativistic matter in the early universe [25], as measured by the PLANCK [26] and WMAP [27] satellites, if its mass is between a few GeV and a TeV and if it has electroweak-scale interaction cross sections. Many new particle physics models such as SUSY [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] also predict WIMPs.",

The representative set of operators for these six categories are C1, C5, D1, D5, D9, and D11, while D8 falls into the same category as D5 but is listed explicitly in Table 1 because it is often used to convert LHC results into limits on DM pair production. In the operator definitions in Table 1, M * is the suppression scale of the interaction, after integrating out the heavy mediator particles. The use of a contact interaction to produce WIMP pairs via heavy mediators is considered conservative because it rarely overestimates cross sections when applied to a specific scenario for physics beyond the SM. Cases where this approach is indeed optimistic are studied in Refs. [40,[42][43][44][45][46]. Despite the caveats related to the validity of the EFT approach (see Appendix A), this formalism is used here, as it provides a framework for comparing LHC results to existing direct or indirect DM searches. Within this framework, interactions of SM and DM particles are described by only two parameters, the suppression scale M and the DM particle mass m \u03c7 . Besides the EFT operators, the pair production of WIMPs is also investigated within a so-called simplified model, where a pair of WIMPs couples to a pair of quarks explicitly via a new mediator particle, a new vector boson Z (see Fig. 1b).",

            "text": "In gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking (GMSB) scenarios [47][48][49][50][51][52], the gravitinoG (spin-3/2 superpartner of the graviton) is often the lightest supersymmetric particle and a potential candidate for DM. Its mass is related to the SUSYbreaking scale \u221a F and M Pl via mG \u221d F/M Pl [53]. At hadron colliders, in low-scale SUSY-breaking scenarios with very light gravitinos, the cross section for associated production of gravitino-squark ( pp \u2192Gq + X ) and gravitino-gluino ( pp \u2192Gg + X ) processes are relatively large [54], since the cross section depends on mG as \u03c3 \u223c 1/m 2G . The decay of the gluino or squark into a gravitino and a gluon (g \u2192Gg) or a gravitino and a quark (q \u2192Gq), respectively, dominates [54]. The final state is characterized by the presence of a pair of gravitinos that escape detection and an energetic jet, leading to a monojet-like topology. Previous studies at colliders [16,55] considered the production of gravitinos in association with a photon or a jet and assumed extremely heavy squarks and gluinos. Within this approximation, a lower limit for the gravitino mass of mG > 1.37 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV was established.",

It also opens up the question of whether a Higgs-like scalar field plays an important role in describing the interaction between dark and ordinary matter in the universe. In particular, a sizeable branching ratio to invisible particles could be interpreted in terms of the production of DM. Results from LEP [58] excluded an invisibly decaying Higgs boson, produced in association with a Z boson, for a boson mass (m H ) below 114.4 GeV. The strongest direct bounds from the LHC experiments on the branching ratio for the Higgs invisible decay mode [59,60] set upper limits of 58 %-65 % at 95 % confidence level (CL), based on the final state in which the Higgs boson is produced either in association with a Z boson or via vector-boson fusion processes. In this analysis, the monojet-like final state is used to search for the production of an invisibly decaying boson with SM Higgs-like properties and a mass in the range between 115 GeV and 300 GeV.",

The estimation of background contributions and the study of systematic uncertainties are discussed in Sects. 6 and 7.

The mass of the charm quark is most relevant for the cross sections of the operator D1 (see Table 1) and it is set to 1.42 GeV. The generated events are interfaced to PYTHIA-6.426 [84] for parton showering and hadronization. The MLM prescription [85] is used for matching the matrix-element calculations of MADGRAPH5 to the parton shower evolution of PYTHIA-6. The samples are subsequently reweighted to the MSTW2008LO [67] PDF set using LHAPDF [86]. The MADGRAPH5 default choice for the renormalization and factorization scales is used. The scales are set to the geometric average of m 2 + p 2 T for the two WIMPs, where m is the mass of the particles. Events with WIMP masses between 10 GeV and 1300 GeV are simulated for six different effective operators (C1, C5, D1, D5, D9, D11). The WIMPs are taken to be either Dirac fermions (D operators) or scalars (C operators), and the pairproduction cross section is calculated at LO. To study the transition between the effective field theory and a physi-cal renormalizable model for Dirac fermion WIMPs coupling to Standard Model particles via a new mediator particle Z , a simplified model is generated in MADGRAPH5. For each WIMP mass point, mediator particle masses M med between 50 GeV and 30 TeV are considered, each for two values of the mediator particle width ( = M med /3 and M med /8\u03c0 ).",

Masses for the boson in the range between 115 GeV and 300 GeV are considered. This Higgs boson is assumed to be produced as predicted in the Standard Model but unlike the SM Higgs it may decay into invisible particles at a significant rate. The signal is modelled using POWHEG-r2262 [88][89][90], which calculates separately the gg \u2192 H and V V \u2192 H production mechanisms with NLO pQCD matrix elements. The description of the Higgs boson p T spectrum in the gg \u2192 H process follows the calculation in Ref. [91], which includes NLO + NNLL corrections. The effects of finite quark masses are also taken into account [92]. For gg \u2192 H and V V \u2192 H processes, POWHEG is interfaced to PYTHIA-8.165 for showering and hadronization. For Z H and W H processes, POWHEG interfaced to HERWIG++ [93] is used and the Z /W bosons are forced to decay to a pair of quarks. The invisible decay of the Higgs-like boson is simulated by forcing the boson to decay to two Z bosons, which are then forced to decay to neutrinos. Signal samples are generated with renormalization and factorization scales set to (m H ) 2 + ( p H T ) 2 . The Higgs boson production cross sections, as well as their uncertainties, are taken from Refs. [94,95]. For the gg \u2192 H process, crosssection calculations at NNLO+NNLL accuracy [96][97][98][99] in pQCD are used and NLO electroweak corrections [100,101] are included. The cross sections for V V \u2192 H processes are calculated with full NLO pQCD and electroweak corrections [102][103][104]. The cross sections for the associated production (W H and Z H) are calculated at NNLO [105] in pQCD, and include NLO electroweak corrections [106].",

The multijet background is determined from data, using a jet smearing method as described in Ref. [120], which relies on the assumption that the E miss T of multijet events is dominated by fluctuations in the detector response to jets measured in the data.

The rate of the fake jets due to cosmic muons surviving the selection criteria, as measured in dedicated cosmic datasets, is found negligible with respect to the rate of data in the monojetlike signal regions. The major source of the non-collision backgrounds is thus beam-halo muons. Since jets due to collisions are expected to be in time with the bunch crossing,  an assumption is made that all events containing a leading jet within the out-of-time window are due to beam-induced backgrounds.

The simplest interaction structures are assumed in all cases. The form of the function f connecting M med and M depends then on the operator (see Appendix A). For a given operator, one possible validity criterion is that the momentum transferred in the hard interaction, Q tr , is below the mediator particle mass: Q tr < M med . According to this criterion, events are omitted where the interaction energy scale exceeds the mediator particle mass. This depends on the values adopted for the couplings. Two values (one and the maximum possible value for the interaction to remain perturbative) are used. After reducing the signal cross section to the fraction of remaining events, the mass suppression scale M can be rederived yielding potentially two additional expected truncated limit lines in Fig. 10. The truncated limits fulfil the respective validity criteria wherever the lines are drawn in the figure. For D9 for example, the maximum couplings criterion is fulfilled for all WIMP masses, the coupling equal to one criterion is fulfilled for WIMP masses up to 200 GeV. For C5 on the other hand, the validity criterion for a coupling value of one is violated over almost the whole WIMP mass range, and a truncated limit line is only drawn up to a WIMP mass of 10 GeV. Figure 10 also includes thermal relic lines (taken from Ref. [41]) that correspond to a coupling, set by M * , of WIMPs to quarks or gluons such that WIMPs have the correct relic abundance as measured by the WMAP satellite, in the absence of any interaction other than the one considered.

With this approach, the coupling of pairs of Dirac fermion WIMPs to quarks via a vector mediator particle (such as a Z boson, corresponding to the operator D5) of a given mass and width (M med and , respectively) is probed. Given the cross-section limit and using simulations at fixed values of M med and , the product of the coupling constants of the Z boson to quarks and WIMPs, \u221a g q g \u03c7 , can be constrained. This constraint corresponds to one value in the M -M med plane as shown in Fig. 11a, since the mass suppression scale can be calculated exactly in this model, M = M med / \u221a g q g \u03c7 . The figure demonstrates how, for a given mediator particle mass and two values of the width , the real value of the mass suppression scale would compare to the M value derived assuming a contact interaction (shown as dashed lines in the figure). This contact interaction regime is reached for M med values larger than 5 TeV in the figure. In the intermediate range (700 GeV < M med < 5 TeV), the mediator would be produced resonantly and the actual M value is higher than in the contact interaction regime. In this case the contact interaction limits would be pessimistic: they would underestimate the actual values. Finally, the small mediator mass regime below 700 GeV has very small M limits because the WIMP would be heavier than the mediator, and WIMP pair production via this mediator would thus be kinematically suppressed. In this region, the contact interaction limits would be optimistic and overestimate the actual M values.",

As already discussed, a SUSY simplified model is used in which the gluino and squark decays lead to a gravitino and a gluon or a quark, respectively, producing a monojet-like signature in the final state. Squark and gluino masses up to 2.6 TeV are considered. The acceptance and efficiency A \u00d7 for the SUSY signal depends on the mass of the squark or gluino in the final state and also on the relation between squark and gluino masses. As an example, in the case of squarks and gluinos degenerate in mass (mg = mq ), the signal A \u00d7 for the SR7 (SR9) selection criteria is in the range 25 %-45 % (10 %-35 %) for squark and gluino masses of about 1-2 TeV. The systematic uncertainties in the SUSY signal yields are determined as in the case of the ADD and WIMP models. The    Results from gamma-ray telescopes [126,127] are also shown, along with the thermal relic density annihilation rate [26,27] uncertainties related to the jet and E miss T scales and resolutions introduce uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between 2 % and 16 % for different selections and squark and gluino masses. The uncertainties in the proton beam energy introduce uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between 2 % and 6 % with increasing squark and gluino masses. The uncertainties related to the modelling of initialand final-state gluon radiation translate into a 10 % to 15 % uncertainty in the signal yields, depending on the selection and the squark and gluino masses. The uncertainties due to PDF result in uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between 5 % and 60 % for squark and gluino masses increas-ing from 50 GeV and 2.6 TeV. Finally, the variations of the renormalization and factorization scales introduce a 15 % to 35 % uncertainty in the signal yields with increasing squark and gluino masses. Figure 13 presents, for the SR7 and SR9 selections and in the case of degenerate squarks and gluinos, \u03c3 \u00d7 A \u00d7 as a function of the squark/gluino mass for different gravitino masses. For comparison, the model-independent 95 % CL limits are shown. For each SUSY point considered in the gravitino-squark/gluino mass plane, observed and expected 95 % CL limits are computed using the same procedure as in the case of the ADD and WIMPs models. This is done sepa-  The shaded bands around the expected limit indicate the expected \u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 ranges of limits in the absence of a signal. The region above the red dotted line defines the validity of the narrow-width approximation (NWA) for which the decay width is smaller than 25 % of the squark/gluino mass rately for the different selections, and the one with the most stringent expected limit is adopted as the nominal result. In the region with squark/gluino masses below 800 GeV, SR7 provides the best sensitivity while SR9 provides the most stringent expected limits for heavier squark/gluino masses. Figure 14 presents the final results. Gravitino masses below 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV, 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV, and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV are excluded at 95 % CL for squark/gluino masses of 500 GeV, 1 TeV, and 1.5 TeV, respectively. The observed limits decrease by about 9 %-13 % after considering the \u22121\u03c3 uncertainty from PDF and scale variations in the theoretical predictions.",

In this case, other decay channels for the gluino and squarks should be considered, leading to a different final state.

            "text": "The results are translated into 95 % CL limits on the production cross section times the branching ratio for a Higgs boson decaying into invisible particles as a function of the boson mass. The SR3 selection provides the best sensitivity to the signal and it is used for the final results. The A \u00d7 of the selection criteria depends on the production mechanism and the boson mass considered. In the case of the gg \u2192 H process, the A \u00d7 varies between 0.1 % and 0.7 % with increasing boson mass from 115 GeV to 300 GeV. It varies between 1 % and 2 % for the V V \u2192 H production process, and varies between 1 % and 12 % in the V H case. The gg \u2192 H process dominates the signal yield and constitutes more than 52 % and 67 % of the boson signal for a boson mass of 125 GeV and 300 GeV, respectively.   The uncertainties related to the jet and E miss T scales and resolutions introduce uncertainties in the signal yields for the SR3 signal region which vary between 10 % and 6 % for the gg \u2192 H and V V \u2192 H processes as the boson mass increases. Similarly, in the case of V H production processes, these uncertainties vary between 8 % and 4 % with increasing mass. The variations of the renormalization and factorization scales introduce a 8 % to 6 %, 0.2 % to 0.8 %, and 1 % to 3 % uncertainty in the boson signal yields for gg \u2192 H , V V \u2192 H , and V H processes, respectively, as the mass increases. The uncertainties due to PDF result in uncertainties in the signal yields which vary between 7 % and 8 %, 2 % and 4 %, and 2 % and 4 % for gg \u2192 H , V V \u2192 H , and V H processes, respectively. The uncertainty in the parton shower modelling results in a 7 % uncertainty in the signal yields for the different channels.  Data 2012 SM uncertainty )+jets  Data 2012 SM uncertainty )+jets In summary, results are reported from a search for new phenomena in events with an energetic jet and large missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV at the LHC, based on ATLAS data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The measurements are in agreement with the SM expectations. The results are translated into model-independent 90 % and 95 % confidencelevel upper limits on \u03c3 \u00d7 A \u00d7 in the range 599-2.9 fb and 726-3.4 fb, respectively, depending on the selection criteria considered. The results are presented in terms of limits on the fundamental Planck scale, M D , versus the number of extra spatial dimensions in the ADD LED model, upper limits on the spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions to the WIMP-nucleon elastic cross section as a function of the WIMP mass, and upper limits on the production of very light gravitinos in gauge-mediated supersymmetry. In addition, the results are interpreted in terms of the production of an invisibly decaying Higgs boson for which the analysis shows a limited sensitivity. The effective field theories (EFTs) used here are based on the assumption that a new mediator particle couples Standard Model particles to pairs of DM particles and that the mediator particle mass is considerably larger than the energy scale of the interaction. In such a case the mediator cannot be produced directly in LHC collisions and can be integrated out with an EFT formalism. This heavy-mediator assumption is indeed justifiable in direct detection WIMP scattering experiments due to the very low momentum exchange typically of order keV in the scattering interactions. This assumption is not always correct at the LHC, where the momentum transfer reaches the TeV scale [43][44][45][46].",
