The measurement of W-boson-pair production is an important test of the electroweak gauge sector of the standard model (SM) of particle physics [1,2]. Extending the measurement to include the properties of jets produced in association with the boson pair is an interesting test of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that has not been performed before in events with multiple heavy gauge bosons. This process is a significant background for Higgs-boson studies in the W \u00fe W \u2212 \u00f0WW\u00de decay mode at particle colliders, where the use of jet vetoes and jet counting is an essential element of the analysis technique [3][4][5][6]. Furthermore, a final state consisting of two massive gauge bosons and two jets is typical of vector-boson scattering, a process sensitive to many non-SM contributions to the electroweak-symmetry-breaking sector [7]. With the first evidence of vector-boson scattering at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [8,9], it is essential to verify and tune the simulation tools used to describe electroweak processes produced in association with jets.",

The differential measurements of jet multiplicity and jet energy are unfolded to hadronic-jet level to account for the detector response to jets of hadrons and compared directly to predictions from two Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The simulations considered are the ALPGEN generator [10], which calculates the lowest perturbative order of the strong interaction that produces a W \u00fe W \u2212 pair of vector bosons and a fixed number of partons in the final state (typically referred to as fixed-order MC), and the MC@NLO next-to-leading order (NLO) generator [11] both interfaced to parton-shower generators. Fixed-order and NLO simulation are widely used methods for modeling electroweak processes with multiple jets. The measurement of differential cross sections as a function of the number of associated jets is particularly suited to the Tevatron because the large rate of top-quark-pair production at the LHC makes this analysis much more difficult. The production of W-boson pairs was first observed by the CDF experiment using Tevatron Run I data [12]. This process has since been measured by the CDF [13], D0 [14], ATLAS [15], and CMS [16,17] experiments.",

The cross section measurement uses an artificial neural network (NN) method to distinguish signal and background events. The jet multiplicity classifications are zero, one, and two or more jets and separate NNs are used for each multiplicity class. Events with a single jet are further classified according to the energy of the jet transverse to the beam line into bins of 15-25 GeV, 25-45 GeV, and more than 45 GeV.

            "text": "We use a NN method to further discriminate signal from background. Separate NNs are trained using the NEUROBAYES [30] program with simulated signal and background events for events with zero, one, and two or more jets. Inputs to the NNs are selected to exploit features of the signal and background processes. The inputs include the total energy of the event, which tends to be modest in WW events compared to tt events; the p T of the second highest p T lepton, which tends to be low in events where a jet or photon is misidentified as a lepton; missing E T that is not aligned with a lepton or jet, suggesting that it is the result of neutrino production; and, in events with two or more jets, the vector sum of the p T of the leading two jets, which tends to be greater if the jets are tt decay products. For events without jets, we use a likelihood ratio of the signal probability density over the sum of signal and background probability densities as an input to the NN [3]. The probability densities are calculated on an event-byevent basis for the signal and each background hypothesis using the observed kinematic properties of the events in leading-order (LO) matrix-element calculations [25]. The sum of final NN outputs for all event classes is shown in Fig. 1. Systematic uncertainties affecting both the normalization and shape of the signal and background NN distributions are assessed for the following sources. Uncertainties on acceptance originating from lepton-selection and triggerefficiency measurements contribute a 4.3% uncertainty on all event yields. Acceptance uncertainties due to potential contributions from higher-order effects are evaluated as follows. For the WW contribution, the ALPGEN sample is reweighted by the p T of the WW system according to samples generated with different choices of PDF, renormalization, and factorization scales. The PDF uncertainty is evaluated with the CTEQ61 PDF error set, and ranges from 1.2% to 1.8%, increasing as a function of jet multiplicity and jet energy. The scale uncertainty is evaluated by doubling or halving the renormalization and factorization scales simultaneously and ranges from 0.5% to 24%, increasing as a function of jet multiplicity and decreasing as a function of jet energy. The scale uncertainties are anticorrelated between adjacent bins of jet energy and jet multiplicity. Between the zero-jet and one-jet bins the anticorrelation is specifically between the bin with no jets and one jet but having the lowest E T . The effect of the scale uncertainty on the shape of the WW NN distributions is also evaluated. For tt contribution an uncertainty of 2.7% is assigned due to QCD effects [31]. For WZ and ZZ backgrounds, which are simulated at LO, a 10% uncertainty is assigned, arising from the difference in the observed acceptance of WW events generated at LO and NLO with PYTHIA and MC@NLO, respectively. Because modeling of higher-order amplitudes can affect the extrapolation of the normalization to the predicted W\u03b3 event yield, this uncertainty is also applied to the W\u03b3 background. A 6.8% uncertainty is also assigned to the W\u03b3 background due to the photon-conversion modeling. An uncertainty of 19% to 26%, increasing as both a function of jet multiplicity and jet energy, is assigned to the DY background to account for mismodeling of E T based on the differences in acceptance observed when varying the E T template in the study of low E T;rel DY events described above. Uncertainty on jet modeling for simulated backgrounds varies from 1.0% to 29%, and is anticorrelated between jet multiplicity and jet energy and generally increases as a function of jet multiplicity. For WW and DY processes, the effect on the shape of the distribution is also evaluated. For the W \u00fe jets background, systematic uncertainties of 20% to 30%, depending on lepton types, are determined by calculating the misidentification probabilities at different jet-energy thresholds. Theoretical uncertainties of 6.0% are assigned to WZ and ZZ cross sections [25] and 4.3% to the tt cross section [24]. The measured luminosity, which is used to normalize the yield of all signal and background processes modeled using simulations, has an uncertainty of 5.9% [32]. Tables including the systematic uncertainties used in each jet classification and all correlations and anticorrelations are given in Ref. [3]. The sum of uncertainties from statistical and systematic sources is included for each signal and background for each jet multiplicity in Table I. The uncertainties on the background predictions are those after the fit described below.",

Systematic uncertainties that affect the shape of the distribution are treated as correlated with the appropriate rate uncertainties.

The likelihood function is maximized with respect to the systematic parameters S c and cross section normalizations \u03b1 WW simultaneously in all regions.

The result is unfolded to the hadronic-jet level based on the results of a study of the bin-to-bin migration of events due to jet reconstruction, jet-energy scale, and jet-resolution effects as determined in simulated events. The final result is iteratively corrected to account for differences in acceptance between the reconstructed and true distributions using a Bayesian [33,34] technique. Migrations between jet-multiplicity and jet-energy bins are typically of order 10% or less. An independent training sample of simulated events is used to test the unfolding process. The correct differential cross sections are reproduced stably with a minimal number of iterations. The unfolded results are compared to ALPGEN, using the CTEQ5L PDFs and interfaced to PYTHIA for parton showering with the MLM matching algorithm [35], and MC@NLO, using the CTEQ5M PDFs and interfaced to HERWIG [36,37] for parton showering. The measured and predicted differential cross sections are shown in Table II and Fig. 2. The differential cross section measurements are consistent with both simulation predictions. The largest deviation occurs in the two-jet sample being less that two standard deviations.
