No excesses over the Standard Model predictions are observed. Bayesian lower limits at the 95% credibility level are placed on the mass of a Z 0 boson, the mass of a supersymmetric \u03c4-sneutrino, and on the threshold mass for quantum black-hole production. For the Z 0 and sneutrino models, upper cross-section limits are converted to upper limits on couplings, which are compared with similar limits from low-energy experiments and which are more stringent for the e\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4 modes.",

            "text": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) is forbidden in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics but is allowed in many extensions of the SM. Many such models predict new particles with LFV decays, such as Z 0 bosons [1], scalar neutrinos in R-parity-violating (RPV) [2,3] supersymmetry (SUSY) and quantum black holes (QBH) in lowscale gravity [4]. Processes with flavor-violating dilepton decays are expected to produce pairs of prompt, differentflavor leptons, a final state with a clear experimental signature and a low background from SM processes. The Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 ll process is an irreducible background for same-flavor lepton searches but in different-flavor searches is limited to the production and decay of a \u03c4\u03c4 pair. This paper describes a search for new phenomena in final states with two leptons of different flavor using 36.1 fb \u22121 of data from proton-proton (pp) collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A common extension of the SM is the addition of an extra U\u00f01\u00de gauge symmetry resulting in a massive neutral vector boson known as a Z 0 boson [1]. The search presented in this paper assumes a Z 0 boson with the same quark couplings and chiral structure as the SM Z boson but only leptonic decays that violate lepton flavor conservation are allowed. The parameter Q ij , where i; j \u00bc 1\u20263 represent the three lepton generations, gives the strength of the LFV couplings relative to the SM ll couplings. The ATLAS Collaboration placed lower limits of 3.3, 2.9, and 2.7 TeV on the mass of a Z 0 boson decaying into e\u03bc, e\u03c4, and \u03bc\u03c4 pairs, respectively, using 3.2 fb \u22121 of the 13 TeV data [5], while the CMS Collaboration has placed limits up to 4.4 TeV on a Z 0 boson decaying into an e\u03bc final state using 35.9 fb \u22121 [6]. Following the same methodology as in Ref. [5], this paper assumes only one LFV coupling is different from zero at any time for the purpose of setting limits on the cross section times branching of each final state considered. Polarization of \u03c4-leptons is not included in the model, but its impact on the \u03c4-lepton acceptance is found to be negligible, and it does not impact the sensitivity to a possible signal.",

A \u03c4-sneutrino (\u03bd \u03c4 ) may be produced in pp collisions by dd annihilation and subsequently decay into e\u03bc, e\u03c4, or \u03bc\u03c4. Although only\u03bd \u03c4 is considered in this paper, results apply to any sneutrino flavor. For the theoretical prediction of the cross section times branching ratio, the\u03bd \u03c4 coupling to first-generation quarks (\u03bb 0 311 ) is assumed to be 0.11 for all channels. As in the Z 0 model, each lepton-flavorviolating final state is considered separately. It is assumed that \u03bb 312 \u00bc \u03bb 321 \u00bc 0.07 for the e\u03bc final state, \u03bb 313 \u00bc \u03bb 331 \u00bc 0.07 for the e\u03c4 final state, and \u03bb 323 \u00bc \u03bb 332 \u00bc 0.07 for the \u03bc\u03c4 final state. These values are chosen such that the signal width is narrow, and allow for comparisons with previous ATLAS and CMS searches [5,7,8].

            "text": "Various models introduce extra spatial dimensions to reduce the value of the Planck mass and resolve the hierarchy problem. The search described in this paper presents interpretations based on the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model [9], assuming n \u00bc 6, where n is the number of extra dimensions, and on the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [10] with one extra dimension. Due to the increased strength of gravity at short distances in these models, pp collisions at the LHC could produce states exceeding the threshold mass (m th ) and form black holes. For the models considered, m th is assumed to be equivalent to the extra-dimensional Planck scale. For masses beyond 3-5 m th , it is expected that thermal black holes would be produced [11,12], characterized by highmultiplicity final states. The search presented in this paper focuses on the mass region below 3-5 m th , known as the quantum gravity regime [13][14][15], where production of nonthermal (or quantum) black holes is expected and these black holes could decay into two-particle final states, producing the topology investigated in this paper. Nonthermal quantum black holes would have a continuum mass distribution from m th up to the beginning of the thermal regime. For the models considered in this paper, the thermal regime is assumed to start at 3m th . The decay of quantum black holes would be governed by a yet unknown theory of quantum gravity. The two main assumptions of the extra-dimensions models considered [4] in this paper are (a) gravity couples with equal strength to all SM particle degrees of freedom and (b) gravity conserves local symmetries (color and electric charge) but can violate global symmetries such as lepton-flavor and baryon-number conservation. Following these assumptions, the branching ratio to each final state is calculated. QBHs decaying into different-flavor, opposite-charge lepton pairs are created via qq or gg annihilation. The branching ratio to ll 0 is 0.87% (0.34%) for a qq (gg) initial state [4]. These models were used in previous ATLAS and CMS searches for quantum black holes in dijet [16][17][18], lepton \u00fe jet [19], photon \u00fe jet [20], e\u03bc [6], and same-flavor dilepton [21] final states.",

Each of the subdetectors is divided into two components, barrel and end cap, to provide coverage close to 4\u03c0 in solid angle. In addition, two magnet systems allow charge and momentum measurements: an axial magnetic field of 2.0 T provided by a solenoid surrounding the ID and a toroidal magnetic field for the MS.

Hadronic calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within j\u03b7j < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic end cap calorimeters. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimized for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. Surrounding the calorimeter system, the MS is the subdetector furthest from the interaction point.

A likelihood discriminant suppresses contributions from hadronic jets, photon conversions, Dalitz decays, and semileptonic heavy-flavor hadron. The likelihood discriminant utilizes lateral and longitudinal calorimeter shower shapes plus tracking and cluster-track matching quantities. The discriminant criterion is a function of the p T and j\u03b7j of the electron candidate. Two operating points are used in this analysis, as defined in Ref. [57]: medium and tight. The tight working point (85% efficient at p T \u00bc 65 GeV determined with Z \u2192 ee events) is required for electron candidates. Electron candidates must have p T > 65 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.47, excluding the region 1.37 < j\u03b7j < 1.52, where the energy reconstruction performance is degraded due to the presence of extra inactive material. Further requirements are made on the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters of the track, which is the distance between the z-position of the point of closest approach of the track in the ID to the beam line and the z-coordinate of the primary vertex relative to the primary vertex of the event (d 0 and \u0394z 0 ). The requirements are the following: jd 0 =\u03c3 d 0 j < 5 and j\u0394z 0 sin \u03b8j < 0.5 mm. Candidates are required to satisfy relative track-based (as defined above for muon candidates) and calorimeter-based isolation requirements with an efficiency of 99% to suppress background from nonprompt electrons originating from heavy-flavor semileptonic decays, charged hadrons, and photon conversions from \u03c0 0 decays. The sum of the calorimeter transverse energy deposits (excluding the electron itself) in an isolation cone of size \u0394R \u00bc 0.2 divided by the electron p T is the discriminant used in the calorimeter-based isolation criterion. For the reducible background estimation, electron candidates passing the medium working point (95% efficient at p T \u00bc 65 GeV determined with Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 ee events) are referred to as \"loose electrons.\"",

It is estimated using simulated events with each jet weighted by its probability to pass the \u03c4-lepton identification as measured in data. This not only ensures the correct fake rate but also improves the statistical precision of the estimate, since events failing the \u03c4-lepton identification requirements are not discarded. The \u03c4 had-vis fake rate is measured in a W \u2192 e=\u03bc \u00fe jets control region as a function of the p T , \u03b7, and number of tracks of the \u03c4 had-vis candidates. The W \u00fe jetsenriched control region uses the same selection as the signal region, but reverses the back-to-back criterion to \u0394\u03d5\u00f0l; l 0 \u00de < 2.7, and uses \u03c4-leptons fulfilling all requirements except identification, although a minimum requirement on the BDT discriminant is retained. Only events with exactly one electron or muon fulfilling all selection criteria, as well as m T > 80 GeV to enrich the W \u00fe jets contribution, are used. Events where the invariant mass of the e or \u03bc and the \u03c4 had-vis candidate is between 80 and 110 GeV are vetoed to reduce contamination from Z boson decays. Contributions from non-W \u00fe jets processes are subtracted using simulation. The \u03c4 had-vis candidates present in the remaining events are dominated by jets. The contribution of events with nonprompt electrons is estimated from simulation and found to be less than 1%. The \u03c4 had-vis fake rate is defined as the fraction of \u03c4 had-vis candidates in the sample that also pass the \u03c4 had-vis identification. This rate is used to weight simulated W \u00fe jets events. The resulting distribution obtained for the W \u00fe jets is validated in the W \u00fe jets-enriched control region, where good agreement is found between data and the expected SM background processes. The uncertainties in the \u03c4 had-vis fake rate are evaluated from (1) the modeling of the loose \u03c4 had-vis identification requirement in simulation, (2) the statistical uncertainty of the data-driven estimation of the \u03c4-lepton fake rate, and (3) the differences in \u03c4-lepton fake rate between signal and control regions. These errors are detailed in the following paragraphs. The \u03c4 had-vis fake rate is reevaluated when removing the m T > 80 GeV requirement to check the contamination from non-W \u00fe jets processes. The effect on the fake rate and the final estimation of the W \u00fe jets background is about 2%.",

The contribution from PDF uncertainties is estimated using different PDF sets and eigenvector variations within a particular PDF set for the top-quark, diboson, and W \u00fe jets backgrounds. The CT10 PDF uncertainty due to eigenvector variations is evaluated through the use of LHAPDF [70] following the prescriptions of Ref. [71]. The uncertainty related to the choice of PDF is evaluated by comparing the results with those from the central value of other PDF sets: MMHT2014 [72], NNPDF3.0 [73], and CT14 [31]. PDF-related uncertainties in the signal shape are not considered. The uncertainties of the m ll 0 modeling in tt events are obtained using separate simulated samples generated with the renormalization scale and h damp parameter varied by factors of 2 and 1=2, and are referred to as\"Top scale\" in Table II. These uncertainties for W \u00fe jets are not considered as they are found to be small, given that this background is mainly composed of real lepton (\u03b5 or \u03bc) and fake \u03c4 pairs. For the diboson background prediction, the PDF systematic is the leading uncertainty. Experimental systematic uncertainties common to signal and background processes are assumed to be correlated. The systematic uncertainties of the estimated SM background and signal yields are summarized in Tables II and III. For signal processes, only experimental systematic uncertainties are considered. The simulated samples contribute a 3% statistical uncertainty to the overall signal acceptance times efficiency.",

Figures 4-6 show the observed and expected 95% C.L. upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio of the Z 0 , RPV SUSY\u03bd \u03c4 and QBH models for each of the final states considered. The extracted limits are not as strong for signal masses above about 2.5 TeV due to a decrease in acceptance at very high p T and, specifically to the LFV Z 0 model, low-mass signal production due to PDF suppression. The results are summarized in Table VIII. The acceptance times efficiency of the ADD and RS QBH models agree within 1%, and the same prediction is used for the limit extraction.",

For the Z 0 model the cross 311 j for a few values of m\u03bd from the cross section times branching ratio limits in this paper (solid, dot-dashed, and dotted lines) and from low-energy experiments (short-dashed, medium-dashed, and long-dashed lines). For the e\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4 channels, the low energy limits for the 2 and 3 TeV mass points are outside the frame, beyond the upper-right corner. section times branching ratio is proportional to Q 2 ll 0 , and the same quark couplings as the SM Z boson are used. The limits on Q ll 0 are shown in Fig. 7 as a function of m Z 0 for the three channels. The most stringent coupling limits from low-energy experiments are from \u03bc-to-e conversion and \u03bc \u2192 eee for the e\u03bc channel, from \u03c4 \u2192 eee and \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bc for the e\u03c4 channel, and from \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bc\u03bc for the \u03bc\u03c4 channel. The current experimental limits on these processes are converted to coupling limits using the formulae of Ref. [80] and are shown in Fig. 7. For the e\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4 channels, the observed limit is restricted up to the Z 0 mass point of 4 TeV. This because for the higher mass points, the limit on Q ll 0 becomes sufficiently large that the total width of the Z 0 would be significantly larger than the experimental resolution and violate our assumptions on that. For the e\u03bc channel, the coupling limits in this paper do not compete with those from low-energy experiments, but for the e\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4 channels, the coupling limits in this paper are more stringent, though they require additional assumptions on the quark couplings.",

The Standard Model predictions are consistent with the data. From the e\u03bc, e\u03c4, and \u03bc\u03c4 final states, Bayesian lower limits at 95% credibility level are set on the mass of a Z 0 vector boson with leptonflavor-violating couplings at 4.5, 3.7, and 3.5 TeV, respectively; on the mass of a supersymmetric \u03c4-sneutrino with R-parity-violating couplings at 3.4, 2.9, and 2.6 TeV; and on the threshold mass for quantum black-hole production in the context of the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (Randall-Sundrum) model at 5.6 (3.4), 4.9 (2.9), and 4.5 (2.6) TeV. The quantum black hole limits extracted are below those extracted in dijet searches, since the branching ratio to dijet is expected to be much larger than to dilepton. Coupling limits for the lepton-flavor-violating Z 0 boson and \u03bd models are more stringent than those from low-energy experiments for the e\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03c4 modes.",
