After the discovery of the W and Z bosons at the SppS hadron collider at CERN, the concurrent operation of hadron and e + e \u2212 colliders has provided a large set of precision data and new observations. Two e + e \u2212 colliders, the SLAC Linear Collider (SLC) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), operated throughout the 1990's and enabled the study of the properties of the Z boson in great detail. Operation at LEP up to 209 GeV, the highest collision energy ever achieved in electronpositron collisions, provided detailed information on the properties of W bosons and the strongest lower bounds on the mass of the Higgs boson and of several supersymmetric particles. The collision of point-like, elementary particles at a well-defined and tunable energy offers advantages for precision measurements, as those conducted at LEP and SLC, over proton colliders. On the other hand experiments at hadron machines, such as the Tevatron pp collider at Fermilab, have enjoyed higher constituent energies. The CDF and D0 experiments eventually observed the direct production of top quarks, whose mass had been predicted on the basis of precision data obtained at LEP and SLC.",

This seminal paper envisaged collisions at 3-4 GeV with a luminosity competitive with that of the SPEAR ring at SLAC, i.e. 3 \u00d7 10 30 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . A possible scheme to obtain e \u2212 e \u2212 and e + e \u2212 collisions at energies of hundreds of GeV is the title of a paper 2 by Ugo Amaldi published a decade later in 1976, which sketches the linear collider concept with a design close to that now developed for the ILC.

            "text": "After a decade marked by important progress in the R&D of the basic components and the setup of advanced test facilities, designs of four different concepts emerged: TESLA, based on superconducting RF cavities, the NLC/JLC-X, based on high frequency (11.4 GHz) room-temperature copper cavities, JLC-C, based on lower frequency (5.7 GHz) conventional cavities and CLIC, a multi-TeV collider based on a different beam acceleration technique, the two-beam scheme with transfer structures operating at 30 GHz. Accelerator R&D had reached the maturity to assess the technical feasibility of a linear collider project and take an informed choice of the most advantageous RF technology. The designs were considered by the International Linear Collider Technical Review Committee (ILC-TRC), originally formed in 1994 and re-convened by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) in 2001 under the chairmanship of Greg A. Loew. The ILC-TRC assessed their status using common criteria, identified outstanding items needing R&D effort and suggested areas of collaboration. The TRC report was released in February 2003 6 and the committee found that there were no insurmountable show-stoppers to build TESLA, NLC/JLC-X or JLC-C in the next few years and CLIC in a more distant future, given enough resources. Nonetheless, significant R&D remained to be done. At this stage, it became clear that, to make further progress, the international effort towards a linear collider should be focused on a single design. ICFA gave mandate to an International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP), chaired by Barry Barish, to make a definite recommendation for a RF technology that would be the basis of a global project. In August 2004 the ITRP made the recommendation in favour of superconducting RF cavities. 7 The technology choice, which was promptly accepted by all laboratories and groups involved in the R&D process, is regarded as a major step towards the realization of the linear collider project. Soon after it, a truly world-wide, centrally managed design effort, the Global Design Effort (GDE), 8 a team of more than 60 persons, started, with the aim to produce an ILC Reference Design Report by beginning of 2007 and an ILC Technical Design Report by end of 2008. The GDE responsibility now covers the detailed design concept, performance assessments, reliable international costing, industrialization plan, siting analysis, as well as detector concepts and scope. A further important step has been achieved with release of the Reference Design Report in February 2007. 9 This report includes a preliminary value estimate of the cost for the ILC in its present design and at the present level of engineering and industrialisation. The value estimate is structured in three parts: 1.78 Billion ILC Value Units for site-related costs, such as those of tunneling in a specific region, 4.87 Billion ILC Value Units for the value of the high technology and conventional components and 13,000 person-years for the required supporting manpower. For this estimate the conversion factor is 1 ILC Value Unit = 1 US Dollar = 0.83 Euro = 117 Yen. This estimate, which is comparable to the LHC cost, when the pre-existing facilities, such as the LEP tunnel, are included, provides guidance for optimisation of both the design and the R&D to be done during the engineering phase, due to start in Fall 2007.",

At the 2001 APS workshop The Future of Physics held in Snowmass, CO, a consensus emerged for the ILC as the right project for the next large scale facility in particle physics. This consensus resonated and expanded in a number of statements by highly influential scientific advisory panels world-wide. The ILC role in the future of scientific research was recognised by the OECD Consultative Group on High Energy Physics, 10 while the DOE Office of Science ranked the ILC as its top mid-term project. More recently the EPP 2010 panel of the US National Academy of Sciences, in a report titled Elementary Particle Physics in the 21 st Century has endorsed the ILC as the next major experimental facility to be built and its role in elucidating the physics at the high energy frontier, independently from the LHC findings. 11 Nowadays, the ILC is broadly regarded as the highest priority for a future large facility in particle physics, needed to extend and complement the LHC discoveries with the accuracy which is crucial to understand the nature of New Physics, test fundamental properties at the high energy scale and establish their relation to other fields in physical sciences, such as Cosmology. A matching program of physics studies and detector R&D efforts has been in place for the past decade and it is now developing new, accurate and cost effective detector designs from proof of concepts towards that stage of engineering readiness, needed for being adopted in the ILC experiments.",

It is here where we most need physics guidance to define the next thresholds at, and beyond, the electro-weak scale. The only threshold which, at present, is well defined numerically is that of top-quark pair production at \u221a s \u2243 350 GeV. Beyond it, there is a strong prejudice, supported by precision electro-weak and other data, that the Higgs boson should be light and new physics thresholds may exist between the electro-weak scale and approximately 1 TeV. If indeed the SM Higgs boson exists and the electro-weak data is not affected by new physics, its mass M H is expected to be below 200 GeV as discussed in section 1.4.1. Taking into account that the Higgs main production process is in association with a Z 0 boson, the maximum of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 H 0 Z 0 cross section varies from \u221a s = 240 GeV to 350 GeV for 120 GeV < M H < 200 GeV. On the other hand, we know that the current SM needs to be extended by some New Physics. Models of electroweak symmetry breaking contain new particles in the energy domain below 1 TeV. More specifically, if Supersymmetry exists and it is responsible for the dark matter observed in the Universe, we expect that a significant fraction of the supersymmetric spectrum would be accessible at \u221a s = 0.5-1.0 TeV. In particular, the ILC should be able to study in detail those particles determining the dark matter relic density in the Universe by operating at energies not exceeding 1 TeV, as discussed in section 1.4.2. Another useful perspective on the ILC energy is an analysis of the mass scale sensitivity for new physics vs. the \u221a s energy for lepton and hadron colliders in view of their synergy. The study of electro-weak processes at the highest available energy offers a window on mass scales well beyond its kinematic reach. A comparison of the mass-scale sensitivity for various new physics scenarios as a function of the centre-of-mass energy for e + e \u2212 and pp collisions is given in section 1.4.3. These and similar considerations, emerged in the course of the world-wide studies on physics at the ILC, motivate the choice of \u221a s = 0.5 TeV as the reference energy parameter, but requiring the ILC to be able to operate, with substantial luminosity, at 0.3 TeV as well and to be upgradable up to approximately 1 TeV.",

            "text": "It is useful to consider these energies in an historical perspective. In 1954 Enrico Fermi gave a talk at the American Physical Society, of which he was chair, titled What can we learn with high energy accelerators ?. In that talk Fermi considered a proton accelerator with a radius equal to that of Earth and 2 T bending magnets, thus reaching a beam energy of 5 \u00d7 10 15 eV. 12 Stanley Livingstone, who had built with Ernest O. Lawrence the first circular accelerator at Berkeley in 1930, had formulated an empirical linear scaling law for the available centre-of-mass energy vs. the construction year and cost. Using Livingstone curve, Fermi predicted that such an accelerator could be built in 1994 at a cost of 170 billion $. We have learned that, not only such accelerator could not be built, but accelerator physics has irrevocably fallen off the Livingstone curve, even in its revised version, which includes data up to the 1980's. As horizons expanded, each step has involved more and more technical challenges and has required more resources. The future promises to be along this same path. This underlines the need of coherent and responsible long term planning while sustaining a rich R&D program in both accelerator and detector techniques.",

Since the energy transferred per turn by the RF cavities to the beam is constant, G \u00d7 2R \u00d7 F , where G is the cavity gradient and F the tunnel fill factor, for each value of the accelerator ring radius R there exists a maximum energy E max beyond which the energy loss exceeds the energy transferred. In practice, before this value of E max is reached, the real energy limit is set by the power dumped by the beam as synchrotron radiation. To make a quantitative example, in the case of the LEP ring, with a radius R =4.3 km, a beam of energy E beam =250 GeV, would lose 80 GeV/turn. Gunther Voss is thought to be the author of a plot comparing the guessed cost of a storage ring and a linear collider as a function of the e + e \u2212 centre-of-mass energy. A \u221a s=500 GeV storage ring, which would have costed an estimated 14 billions CHF in 1970's is aptly labelled as the Crazytron. 13 LEP filled the last window of opportunity for a storage ring at the high energy frontier. Beyond LEP-2 energies the design must be a linear collider, where no bending is applied to the accelerated particles. Still the accelerator length is limited by a number of constraints which include costs, alignment and siting. Therefore, technology still defines the maximum reachable energy at the ILC. The ILC design is based on superconducting (s.c. ) radio-frequency (RF) cavities. While s.c. cavities had been considered already in the 1960's, it was Ugo Amaldi to first propose a fully s.c. linear collider in 1975. 2 By the early 1990's, s.c. cavities equipped already one accelerator, TRISTAN at KEK in Japan, while two further projects were in progress, CEBAF at Cornell and the LEP-2 upgrade at CERN. LEP-2 employed a total of 288 s.c. RF cavities, providing an average gradient of 7.2 MV/m. It was the visionary effort of Bjorn Wijk to promote, from 1990, the TESLA collaboration, with the aim to develop s.c. RF cavities pushing the gradient higher by a factor of five and the production costs down by a factor of four, thus reducing the cost per MV by a factor of twenty. Such reduction in cost was absolutely necessary to make a high energy collider, based on s.c. cavities, feasible. Within less than a decade 1.3 GHz, pure niobium cavities achieved gradients in excess to 35 MV/m. This opened the way to their application to a e + e \u2212 linear collider, able to reach centre-of-mass energies of the order of 1 TeV, as presented in detail in the TESLA proposal published in 2001 14 and recommended for the ILC by the ITRP in 2004. 7 Today, the ILC baseline design aims at matching technical feasibility to cost optimisation. One of the major goals of the current effort in the ILC design is to understand enough about its costs to provide a reliable indication of the scale of funding required to carry out the ILC project. Preparing a reliable cost estimate for a project to be carried out as a truly world-wide effort at the stage of a conceptual design that still lacks much of the detailed engineering designs as well as agreements for responsibility and cost sharing between the partners and a precise industrialisation plan is a great challenge. Still having good cost information as soon as possible, to initiate negotiations with the funding agencies is of great importance. An interesting example of the details entering in this process is the optimisation of the cost vs. cavity gradient for a 0.5 TeV collider. The site length scales inversely with the gradient G while the cost of the cryogenics scales as G 2 /Q 0 resulting in a minimum cost for a gradient of 40 MW/m, corresponding to a tunnel length of 40 km, and a fractional cost increase of 10 % for gradients of 25 MV/m or 57 MV/m. The chosen gradient of 35 MV/m, which is matched by the average performance of the most recent prototypes after electro-polishing, gives a total tunnel length of 44 km with a cost increment from the minimum of just 1 %.",

The generation of beams of small transverse size, their preservation during acceleration and their focusing to spots of nanometer size at the interaction region presents powerful challenges which the ILC design must solve. A small beam size also induces beam-beam interactions. On one hand the beam self-focusing, due to the electrostatic attraction of particles of opposite charges enhances the luminosity. But beam-beam interactions also result in an increase of beamstrahlung with a larger energy spread of the colliding particles, a degraded luminosity spectrum and higher backgrounds.

The SM addresses this question by the Higgs mechanism. 27 The first direct manifestation of the Higgs mechanism through the Higgs sector will be the existence of at least one Higgs boson. The observation of a new spin-0 particle would represent a first sign that the Higgs mechanism of mass generation is indeed realised in Nature. This has motivated a large experimental effort, from LEP-2 to the Tevatron and, soon, the LHC, actively backed-up by new and more accurate theoretical predictions. After a Higgs discovery, which we anticipate will be possible at the LHC, full validation of the Higgs mechanism can only be established by an accurate study of the Higgs boson production and decay properties. It is here where the ILC potential in precision physics will be crucial for the validation of the Higgs mechanism, through a detailed study of the Higgs profile. 31 The details of this study depend on the Higgs boson mass, M H . In the SM, M H = \u221a 2\u03bbv where the Higgs field expectation value v is determined as ( At the ILC the Higgs boson can be observed in the Higgs-strahlung production process e + e \u2212 \u2192 HZ with Z \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 , independent of its decay mode, by the distinctive peak in the di-lepton recoil mass distribution.

Outlining the Higgs boson profile, through the determination of its mass, width, quantum numbers, couplings to gauge bosons and fermions and the reconstruction of the Higgs potential, stands as a most challenging, yet compelling, physics program. The ILC, with its large data sets at different centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation conditions, the high resolution detectors providing unprecedented accuracy on the reconstruction of the event properties and the use of advanced analysis techniques, developed from those successfully adopted at LEP and SLC, promises to promote Higgs physics into the domain of precision measurements. Since the Higgs mass M H is not predicted by theory, it is of great interest to measure it precisely. Once this mass, and thus \u03bb, is fixed, the profile of the Higgs particle is uniquely determined in the SM. In most scenarios we expect the LHC to determine the Higgs mass with a good accuracy. At the ILC, this measurement can be refined by exploiting the kinematical characteristics of the Higgs-strahlung production process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z * \u2192 H 0 Z 0 where the Z 0 can be reconstructed in both its leptonic and hadronic decay modes. The \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 recoil mass for leptonic Z 0 decays yields an accuracy of 110 MeV for 500 fb \u22121 of data, without any requirement on the nature of the Higgs decays. Further improvement can be obtained by explicitly selecting H \u2192 bb (W W ) for M H \u2264(>) 140 GeV. Here a kinematical 5-C fit, imposing energy and momentum conservation and the mass of a jet pair to correspond to M Z , achieves an accuracy of 40 to 90 MeV for 120< M H < 180 GeV. 32 The total decay width of the Higgs boson is predicted to be too narrow to be resolved experimentally for Higgs boson masses below the ZZ threshold. On the contrary, above \u2243 200 GeV, the total width can be measured directly from the reconstructed width of the recoil mass peak, as discussed below. For the lower mass range, indirect methods must be applied. In general, the total width is given by \u0393 tot = \u0393 X /BR(H \u2192 X). Whenever \u0393 X can be determined independently of the corresponding branching fraction, a measurement of \u0393 tot can be carried out. The most convenient choice is the extraction of \u0393 H from the measurements of the W W fusion cross section and the H \u2192 W W * decay branching fraction . A relative precision of 6% to 13% on the width of the Higgs boson can be obtained at the ILC with this technique, for masses between 120 GeV and 160 GeV. The spin, parity and charge-conjugation quantum numbers J P C of Higgs bosons can be determined at the ILC in a model-independent way. Already the observation of either \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H production or H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay sets J = 1 and C = +.

This requires to precisely test the relation g HXX \u221d m X between the Yukawa couplings, g HXX , and the corresponding particle masses, m X . In fact, the SM Higgs couplings to fermion pairs g Hf f = m f /v are fully determined by the fermion mass m f . The corresponding decay partial widths only depend on these couplings and on the Higgs boson mass, QCD corrections do not represent a significant source of uncertainty. 35 Therefore, their accurate determination will represent a comprehensive test of the Higgs mechanism of mass generation. 36 Further, observing deviations of the measured values from the SM predictions will probe the structure of the Higgs sector and may reveal a non-minimal implementation of the Higgs model or the effect of new physics inducing a shift of the Higgs couplings. [37][38][39] The accuracy of these measurements relies on the performances of jet flavour tagging and thus mostly on the Vertex Tracker, making this analysis an important benchmark for optimising the detector design. It is important to ensure that the ILC sensitivity extends over a wide range of Higgs boson masses and that a significant accuracy is achieved for most particle species. Here, the ILC adds the precision which establishes the key elements of the Higgs mechanism. It is important to point out that these tests are becoming more stringent now that the B-factories have greatly improved the determination of the b-and c-quark masses. When one of these studies was first presented in 1999, 40 the b quark mass was known to \u00b10.11 GeV and the charm mass to \u00b10.13 GeV, with the expectation that e + e \u2212 B-factory and LHC data could reduce these uncertainties by a factor of two by the time the ILC data would be analysed. Today, the analysis of a fraction of the BaBar data 41 has already brought these uncertainties down to 0.07 GeV for m b and, more importantly, 0.09 GeV for m c , using the spectral moments technique in semi-leptonic B decays, which had been pioneered on CLEO 42 and DELPHI data. 43 Extrapolating to the anticipated total statistics to be collected at PEP-II and KEKB, we can now confidently expect that the b quark mass should be known to better than \u00b10.05 GeV and the charm mass to better than \u00b10.06 GeV. This translates into less than \u00b10.4 % and \u00b16.5 % relative uncertainty in computing the Higgs SM couplings to b and c quarks, respectively, and motivates enhanced experimental precision in the determination of these couplings at the ILC. Detailed simulation shows that these accuracy can be matched by the ILC. 44,47 While much of the emphasis on the ILC capabilities in the study of the Higgs profile is for a light Higgs scenario, preferred by the current electroweak data and richer in decay modes, the ILC has also the potential of precisely mapping out the Higgs boson properties for heavier masses. If the Higgs boson turns out to weigh of order 200 GeV, the 95% C.L. upper limit indicated by electro-weak fits, or even heavier, the analysis of the recoil mass in e + e \u2212 \u2192 HZ at \u221a s = 0.5 TeV allows to precisely determine M H , \u0393 H and the Higgs-strahlung cross section. Even for M H = 240 GeV, the mass can be determined to a 10 \u22123 accuracy and, more importantly, the total width measured about 10% accuracy. Decays of Higgs bosons produced in e + e \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd\u03bd give access to the Higgs couplings. The importance of the W W -  fusion process e + e \u2212 \u2192 H 0 \u03bd\u03bd to probe rare Higgs decays at higher energies, emerged in the physics study for a multi-TeV linear collider. 45   46,47 W W and ZZ couplings can be determined with relative accuracies of 3 % and 5 % respectively, while the coupling to bb pairs, a rare decay with a branching fraction of just 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at such large masses, can be determined to 4 % to 14 % for 180 GeV < M H < 220 GeV. This measurement is of great importance, since it would offer the only opportunity to learn about the fermion couplings of such an heavy Higgs boson, and it is unique to a linear collider.",

            "text": "By determining g HHH , the above relation can be tested. The ILC has access to the triple Higgs coupling through the double Higgs production processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 HHZ and e + e \u2212 \u2192 HH\u03bd\u03bd. 48 Deviations from the SM relation for the strength of the Higgs self-coupling arise in models with an extended Higgs sector. 49 The extraction of g HHH is made difficult by their tiny cross sections and by the dilution effect, due to diagrams leading to the same double Higgs final states, but not sensitive to the triple Higgs vertex. This makes the determination of g HHH a genuine experimental tour de force. Other modes, such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 HHbb, have also been recently proposed 50 but signal yields are too small to provide any precise data. Operating at \u221a s = 0.5 TeV the ILC can measure the HHZ production cross section to about 15% accuracy, if the Higgs boson mass is 120 GeV, corresponding to a fractional accuracy on g HHH of 23%. 51 Improvements can be obtained first by introducing observables sensitive to the presence of the triple Higgs vertex and then by performing the analysis at higher energies where the HH\u03bd\u03bd channel contributes. 52 In the HHZ process events from diagrams containing the HHH vertex exhibit a lower invariant mass of the HH system compared to double-Higgstrahlung events. When the M HH spectrum is fitted, a relative statistical accuracy of \u00b10.20 can be obtained with 1 ab \u22121 at \u221a s = 0.5 TeV. The availability of beam polarization increases the HHZ cross section by a factor of two and that for HH\u03bd\u03bd by a factor of four, thus offering a further possible significant improvement to the final accuracy. The ILC and, possibly, a multi-TeV e + e \u2212 collider represent a unique opportunity for carrying out this fundamental measurement. In fact, preliminary studies show that, the analysis of double Higgs production at the LHC is only possible after a luminosity upgrade and, even then, beyond the observation of double Higgs production, it would provide only a very limited information on the triple-Higgs coupling . at \u221a s \u2264 1 TeV the ILC might appear to be limited in reach, somewhere within the energy domain being probed by the Tevatron and that to be accessed by LHC. And yet its potential for fully understanding the new physics, which the LHC might have manifested, and for probing the high energy frontier beyond the boundaries explored in hadron collisions is of paramount importance. There are several examples of how the ILC will be essential for understanding new physics. They address scenarios where signals of physics beyond the SM, as observed at the LHC, may be insufficient to decide on the nature of the new phenomena. One such example, which has been studied in some details, is the case of Supersymmetry and Universal Extra Dimensions (UED), two very different models of new physics leading to the very same experimental signature: fermion pairs plus missing energy. Here, the limited analytical power of the LHC may leave us undecided, 56,57 while a single spin measurement performed at the ILC precisely identifies the nature of the observed particles. 58 But the ILC capability to fully understand the implications of new physics, through fundamental measurements performed with high accuracy, is manifested also in scenarios where the LHC could observe a significant fraction of the new particle spectrum. An especially compelling example, which can be studied quan-titatively, is offered by Supersymmetry in relation to Dark Matter (DM). Dark Matter has been established as a major component of the Universe. We know from several independent observations, including the cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernovas (SNs) and galaxy clusters, that DM is responsible for approximately 20 % of the energy density of the universe. Yet, none of the SM particles can be responsible for it and the observation of DM is likely the first direct signal of new physics beyond the SM. Several particles and objects have been nominated as candidates for DM. They span a wide range of masses, from 10 \u22125 eV, in the case of axions, to 10 \u22125 solar masses, for primordial black holes. Cosmology tells us that a significant fraction of the Universe mass consists of DM, but does not provide clues on its nature. Particle physics tells us that New Physics must exist at, or just beyond, the EW scale and new symmetries may result in new, stable particles. Establishing the inter-relations between physics at the microscopic scale and phenomena at cosmological scale will represent a major theme for physics in the next decades. The ILC will be able to play a key role in elucidating these inter-relations. Out of these many possibilities, there is a class of models which is especially attractive since its existence is independently motivated and DM, at about the observed density, arises naturally. These are extensions of the SM, which include an extra symmetry protecting the lightest particle in the new sector from decaying into ordinary SM states. The lightest particle becomes stable and can be chosen to be neutral. Such a particle is called a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and arises in Supersymmetry with conserved R-parity (SUSY) but also in Extra Dimensions with KK-parity (UED). 66 Current cosmological data, mostly through the WMAP satellite measurements of the CMB, determine the DM density in the Universe with a 6 % relative accuracy. 59 By the next decade, the PLANCK satellite will push this uncertainty to \u2243 1 %, or below. 60 Additional astrophysical data manifest a possible evidence of DM annihilation. The EGRET data show excess of \u03b3 emission in the inner galaxy, which has been interpreted as due to DM 61 and the WMAP data itself may show a signal of synchrotron emission in the Galactic center. 62 These data, if confirmed, may be used to further constrain the DM properties. Ground-based DM searches are also approaching the stage where their sensitivity is at the level predicted by Supersymmetry for some combinations of parameters. 63 The next decades promise to be a time when accelerator experiments will provide new breakthroughs and highly accurate data to gain new insights, not only on fundamental questions in particle physics, but also in cosmology, when studied alongside the observations from satellites and other experiments. The questions on the nature and the origin of DM offer a prime example of the synergies of new experiments at hadron and lepton colliders, at satellites and ground-based DM experiments.",

            "text": "A particle with mass M = O(100 GeV) and weak cross section would naturally give the measured DM density. It is quite suggestive that new physics, responsible for the breaking of electro-weak symmetry, also introduce a WIMP of about that mass. In fact, in essentially every model of electroweak symmetry breaking, it is possible to add a discrete symmetry that makes the lightest new particle stable. Often, this discrete symmetry is required for other reasons. For example, in Supersymmetry, the conserved R parity is needed to eliminate rapid proton decay. In other cases, such as models with TeV-scale extra dimensions, the discrete symmetry is a natural consequence of the underlying geometry. Data on DM density already set rather stringent constraints on the parameters of Supersymmetry, if the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 is indeed responsible for saturating the amount of DM observed in the Universe. It is useful to discuss the different scenarios, where neutralino DM density is compatible with the WMAP result, in terms of parameter choices in the context of the constrained MSSM (cMSSM), to understand how the measurements that the ILC provides can establish the relation between new physics and DM. The cMSSM reduces the number of free parameters to just five: the common scalar mass, m 0 , the common gaugino mass, m 1/2 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields, tan \u03b2, the sign of the Higgsino mass parameter, \u00b5, and the common trilinear coupling, A 0 . It is a remarkable feature of this model that, as these parameters, defined at the unification scale, are evolved down to lower energies, the electroweak symmetry is broken spontaneously and masses for the W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons generated automatically. As this model is simple and defined by a small number of parameters, it is well suited for phenomenological studies. The cosmologically interesting regions in the m 0 -m 1/2 parameter plane are shown in Figure 1.10. As we move away from the bulk region, at small values of m 0 and m 1/2 , which is already severely constrained by LEP-2 data, the masses of supersymmetric particles increase and so does the dark matter density. It is therefore necessary to have an annihilation process, which could efficiently remove neutralinos in the early universe, to restore the DM density to the value measured by WMAP. Different processes define three main regions: i) the focus point region, where the \u03c7 0 1 contains an admixture of the supersymmetric partner of a neutral Higgs boson and annihilates to W + W \u2212 and Z 0 Z 0 , ii) the co-annihilation region, where the lightest slepton has a mass very close to M \u03c7 0 1 , iii) the A annihilation funnel, where M (\u03c7 0 1 ) is approximately half that of the heavy A 0 Higgs boson, providing efficient s-channel annihilation, \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 A. In each of these regions, researchers at the ILC will be confronted with several different measurements and significantly different event signatures. It is interesting to observe that the DM constraint, reduces the dimensionality of the cMSSM plane, by one unit, since the allowed regions are tiny lines in the m 0 -m 1/2 plane, evolve with tan \u03b2 and depend only very weakly on A 0 . 65 Representative benchmark points have been defined and their parameters are summarised in Table 1  ogy is common to the more general supersymmetric solutions and we shall soon discuss the extension of results derived in this constrained model to the general MSSM. There are several features which are common to all these regions. First, the relic density depends on the mass of the lightest neutralino and of few additional particles, close in mass to it. The heavier part of the SUSY spectrum decouples from the value of \u2126 \u03c7 h 2 . This is of particular importance for the ILC. Running at \u221a s \u2264 1 TeV, the ILC will not be able to study supersymmetric particles exceeding \u2243450-490 GeV, in particular scalar quarks and heavy Higgs bosons in some regions of the parameter phase space. But, independently of the LHC results, the ILC will either observe and measure these particles if they may be relevant to determine the relic DM density, or it will set bounds that ensure their decoupling. A second important observation is that \u2126 \u03c7 h 2 typically depends on SUSY parameters which can be fixed by accurate measurements of particle masses, particle mass splittings, decay branching fractions and production cross sections. In some instances the availability of polarised beams is advantageous. The LHC can often make precise measurements of some particles, but it is difficult for the LHC experiments to assemble the complete set of parameters needed to reconstruct annihilation cross section. It is also typical of supersymmetry spectra to contain light particles that may be very difficult to observe in the hadron collider environment. The ILC, in contrast, provides just the right setting to obtain both types of measurements. Again, it is not necessary for the ILC to match the energy of the LHC, only that it provides enough energy to see the lightest charged particles of the new sector.",

While the assumptions of the cMSSM are quite helpful for defining a set of benchmark points, the cMSSM is not representative of the generic MSSM, since it implies several mass relations, and its assumptions have no strong physics justification. Therefore, in studying the accuracy on \u2126 \u03c7 h 2 , the full set of MSSM parameters must be scanned in an uncorrelated way and the mass spectrum evaluated for each parameter set. A detailed study has recently been performed. 74 I summarise here some of the findings, Table 1.5 gives results for the neutralino relic density estimates in MSSM for the LHC, the ILC at 0.5 TeV and the ILC at 1 TeV. The LCC1 point is in the bulk region and the model contains light sleptons, with masses just above that of the lightest neutralino. The most important annihilation reactions are those with t-channel slepton exchange. At the LHC, many of the SUSY spectrum parameters can be determined from kinematic constraints. At the ILC masses can be determined both by the two-body decay kinematics of the pair-produced SUSY particles and by dedicated threshold scans.

However, in more general scenarios, the information available from both collider will be more limited. This is the case at the LCC2 point, located in the focus point region, where masses of scalar quarks, sleptons and heavy Higgs bosons are very large, typically beyond the ILC but also the LHC reach, while gauginos masses are of the order of few hundreds GeV, thus within the kinematical domain of the ILC. In this specific scenario, the LHC will observe the SUSY processg \u2192 qq\u03c7 and the subsequent neutralino and chargino decays. Still the neutralino relic density can only be constrained within \u00b140% and the hypothesis \u2126 \u03c7 h 2 = 0, namely that the neutralino does not contribute to the observed dark matter density in the universe, cannot be ruled out, based only on LHC data. At a 0.5 TeV collider, the main SUSY reactions are e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7 + 1 \u03c7 \u2212 1 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7 0 2 \u03c7 0 3 . Operation at 1 TeV gives access also to e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7 e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7 0 3 \u03c7 0 4 . Not only the gaugino mass splittings but also the polarised neutralino and chargino production cross section can be accurately determined at the ILC. 68 These measurements fix the gaugino-Higgsino mixing angles, which play a major role in determining the neutralino relic density. The decoupling of the heavier, inaccessible part of the SUSY spectrum, can be insured with the data at the highest energy. The combined ILC data at 0.5 TeV and 1 TeV provide an estimate of the neutralino relic density to \u00b18 % accuracy, which matches the current WMAP precision. The characteristics featured by the LCC2 point persist, while the SUSY masses increase, provided the gaugino-Higgsino mixing angle remains large enough. This DM-motivated region extends to SUSY masses which eventually exceed the LHC reach, highlighting an intriguing region of parameters where the ILC can still observe sizable production of supersymmetric particle, compatible with dark matter data, while the LHC may report no signals of New Physics. 82 Instead, the last two points considered, LCC3 and LCC4, are representative of those regions where the neutralino relic density is determined by accidental relationships between particle masses. Other such regions may also be motivated by baryogenesis constraints. 83 The determination of the neutralino relic density, in such scenarios, depends crucially on the precision of spectroscopic measurements, due to the large sensitivity on masses and couplings. The conclusions of the current studies are that the LHC data do not provide quantitative constraints. On the contrary, the ILC can obtain interesting precision, especially when high energy data is available. The LCC3 point is in the so-called\u03c4 co-annihilation region. Here, the , so this scenario tightly constrain the m\u03c4 \u2212 m \u03c7 mass difference. Here, the precise mass determinations characteristic of LCC1 will not be available: at 0.5 TeV, the ILC will observe a single final state, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 + E missing , from the two accessible SUSY processes, 69 e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c4 1\u03c41 , \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c7 0 1 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 2 , \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 1 \u03c4 \u03c4 . The signal topology consists of two \u03c4 -jets and missing energy. Background processes, such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZZ can be suppressed using cuts on event shape variables. The mass splitting can be determined by a study of the distribution of the invariant mass of the system made by the two \u03c4 -jets and the missing energy vector, M j1j2Emissing . In this variable, the remaining SM background is confined to low values and the shape and upper endpoint of the\u03c4 1\u03c41 contri-bution depends on the stau-neutralino mass difference, \u2206M = M\u03c4 1 \u2212 M \u03c7 0 1 . Templates functions can be generated for different values of \u2206M and the mass difference is extracted by a \u03c7 2 fit of these templates to the \"data\". As the \u2206M value decreases, the energy available to the \u03c4 leptons decreases. Since \u03c4 decays involve neutrinos, additional energy is lost from detection. When the \u03c4 \u03c4 system becomes soft, the four fermion background process ee \u2192 ee\u03c4 \u03c4 , the so-called \u03b3\u03b3 background which has cross sections at the nb level, makes its detection increasingly difficult. What makes possible to reject these \u03b3\u03b3 events is the presence of the two energetic primary electrons at small angle w.r.t. the beamline. 79 This is a significant challenge for low angle calorimetry, since the electron has to be detected in an hostile environment populated by a large number of other electrons, of lower energy, arising from pairs created during the bunch collision. 80,81 A detailed study, 69 performed for a statistics of 500 fb \u22121 , shows that values of \u2206M as small as 5 GeV can be measured at the ILC, provided the primary electrons can be vetoed down to 17 mrad. In the specific case of the LCC3 point, where the mass splitting, \u2206M , is 10.8 GeV, an accuracy of 1 GeV can be achieved. Heavier gauginos, as well as the A 0 boson, become accessible operating the ILC at 1 TeV. These data constrain both the mixing angles and tan \u03b2. As a result the neutralino relic density can be estimated with an 18 % accuracy. Finally, the LCC4 point, chosen in the A funnel, has the DM density controlled by the \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 A process. This point is rather instructive in terms of the discovery-driven evolution of a possible experimental program at the ILC. The ILC can obtain the neutralino and\u03c4 masses at 0.5 TeV, following the same technique as for LCC3. We would also expect LHC experiments to have observed the A 0 boson, but it is unlikely M A could be determined accurately in pp collisions, since the available observation mode is the decay in \u03c4 lepton pairs. At this stage, it would be apparent that the mass relation between the neutralino mass, accurately measured by the ILC at 0.5 TeV, and the A boson mass, from the LHC data, is compatible with M A \u2243 2M \u03c7 , as required for the s-channel annihilation process to be effective. Three more measurements have to be performed at the ILC: the A 0 mass, M A , and width \u0393 A and the \u00b5 parameter, which is accessible through the mass splitting between heavier neutralinos, \u03c7 0 3 , \u03c7 0 4 and the lighter \u03c7 0 1 , \u03c7 0 2 . All these measurements are available by operating the ILC at 1 TeV. M A and \u0393 A can be determined by studying the A 0 production in association with a H 0 boson, in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 A 0 H 0 \u2192 bbbb. This process results in spectacular events with four b jets, emitted almost symmetrically, due to low energy carried by the heavy Higgs bosons (see Figure 1.13a). The cross section, for the parameters of LCC4 corresponding to M A = 419 GeV, is just 0.9 fb highlighting the need of large luminosity at the highest energy. Jet flavour tagging and event shape analysis significantly reduces the major multi-jet backgrounds, such as W W , ZZ and tt. The SM bbbb electro-weak background has a cross section of \u223c3 fb, but since it includes Z 0 or h 0 as intermediate states it can be efficiently removed by event shape and mass cuts. After event selection, the A 0 mass and width must be reconstructed from the measured di-jet invariant masses. This is achieved by pairing jets in the way that minimises the resulting di-jet mass difference, since the masses of the A and H bosons are expected to be degenerate within a few GeV, and the di-jet masses are computed by imposing constraints on energy and momentum conservation to improve the achievable resolution and gain sensitivity to the boson natural width (see Figure 1.13b). The result is a determination of the A mass to 0.2 % and of its width to \u224315 % if a sample of 2 ab \u22121 of data can be collected. The full set of ILC data provides a neutralino relic density evaluation with 19 % relative accuracy. The full details of how these numbers were obtained can be found in Ref. 74 .",

The interplay of satellite, ground-based and collider experiments in cosmology and particle physics will be unique and it will lead us to learn more about the structure of our Galaxy and of the Universe as well as of the underlying fundamental laws of the elementary particles.

The mixing angle is already strongly constrained, by precision electroweak data, and can be of the order of few mrad at most, while direct searches at Tevatron for a new Z \u2032 boson set a lower limit on its mass around 800 GeV, which may reach 1 TeV by the time the LHC will start searching for such a state. The search for an extended gauge sector offers an interesting framework for studying the ILC sensitivity to scales beyond those directly accessible. It also raises the issue of the discrimination between different models, once a signal would be detected. The main classes of models with additional Z \u2032 bosons include E 6 inspired models and leftright models (LR). In the E 6 models, the Z \u2032 fermion couplings depend on the angle, \u03b8 6 , defining the embedding of the extra U (1) in the E 6 group. At the ILC, the indirect sensitivity to the mass of the new boson, M Z \u2032 , can be parametrised in terms of the available integrated luminosity, L, and centre-of-mass energy, \u221a s. A scaling law for large values of M Z \u2032 can be obtained by considering the effect of the Z \u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 interference in the two fermion production cross section \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 ff ) (\u03c3 ff in the following).

Another possible technique uses the charge of secondary particles to determine the vertex charge and thus the quark charge. The application of this technique to the ILC has been studied in some details in relation to the optimisation of the Vertex Tracker. 91 At ILC energies, the e + e \u2212 \u2192 ff cross sections are significantly reduced, compared to those at LEP and SLC: at 1 TeV the cross section \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb) is only 100 fb, so high luminosity is essential and new experimental issues emerge. At 1 TeV, the ILC beamstrahlung parameter doubles compared to 0.5 TeV, beam-beam effects becoming important, and the primary e + e \u2212 collision is accompanied by \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 hadrons interactions. 92 Being mostly confined in the forward regions, this background may reduce the polar angle acceptance for quark flavour tagging and dilute the jet charge separation using jet charge techniques. The statistical accuracy for the determination of \u03c3 ff , A ff F B and A ff LR has been studied, for \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and bb, taking the ILC parameters at \u221a s = 1 TeV. The additional particles from the \u03b3\u03b3 background cause a broadening of the Q jet distribution and thus a dilution of the quark charge separation. Detailed full simulation and reconstruction is needed to fully understand these effects. Despite these backgrounds, the anticipated experimental accuracy in the determination of the electro-weak observables in two-fermion processes at 1 TeV is of the order of a few percent, confirming the ILC role as the precision machine. Several scenarios of new physics have been investigated. 93,94 The analysis of the cross section and asymmetries at 1 TeV would reveal the existence of an additional Z \u2032 boson up to \u2243 6-15 TeV, depending on its couplings. As a comparison the LHC direct sensitivity extends up to approximately 4-5 TeV. The ILC indirect sensitivity also extends to different models on new physics, such as 5-dimensional exten- sion of the SM with fermions on the boundary for a compactification where scales up to about 30 TeV can be explored. Finally, fermion compositeness or the exchange of very heavy new particles can be described in terms of effective four-fermion contact interactions. 96 The interaction depends on a scale \u039b = M X /g, where M X is the mass of the new particle and g the coupling. Limits to this scale \u039b can be set up to \u2243 100 TeV, which shows that the ILC sensitivity to new phenomena can exceed its centre-of-mass energy by a significant factor. In order to maximise this indirect sensitivity to new physics, the precision of the SM predictions should match the experimental accuracy. Now, at TeV energies, well above the electroweak scale,the ILC will face the effects of large non-perturbative corrections. Large logarithms \u221d \u03b1 n log 2n (M 2 /s) arise from the exchange of collinear, soft gauge bosons and are known as Sudakov logarithms. 95 At 1 TeV the logarithmically enhanced W corrections to \u03c3 bb , of the form \u03b1 log 2 (M 2 W /s) and \u03b1 log(M 2 W /s) amount to 19% and -4% respectively. The effect of these large logarithmic corrections has been studied in some details. 17,97 It will be essential to promote a program of studies to reduce these theoretical uncertainties, to fully exploit the ILC potential in these studies.",

Not only the centre-of-mass energy can be changed over approximately an order of magnitude, but the beam particle and their polarization state can be varied to suit the need of the physics processes under study. At the same time, the ILC program is most diversified and data taken at the same centre-of-mass energy may be used for very different analyses, such as precise top mass determination, Higgs boson studies and reconstruction of SUSY decays. This has raised concerns whether the claimed ILC accuracies can be all achieved with a finite amount of data. A dedicated study was performed in 2001, under the guidance of Paul Grannis, taking two physics scenarios with Supersymmetry realised at relatively low mass, one being the LCC1 benchmark point, rich in pair-produced particles and requiring detailed threshold scans. 98 The study assumes a realistic profile for the delivered luminosity, which increases from 10 fb \u22121 in the first year to 200 fb \u22121 in the fifth year and 250 fb \u22121 afterward, for a total integrated equivalent luminosity L = 1 ab \u22121 . The proposed run plan starts at the assumed maximum energy of 0.5 TeV for a first determination of the sparticle masses through the end-point study and then scans the relevant thresholds, including tt in short runs with tuned polarization states. A summary is given in Table 1.6. This plan devotes approximately two third of the total luminosity at, or near, the maximum energy, so the program will be sensitive to unexpected new phenomena at high energy, while providing accurate measurements of masses through dedicated scans.",

This effort is motivated by the need to design and construct detectors which match the ILC promise to provide extremely accurate measurements over a broad range of collision energies and event topologies. It is important to stress that, despite more than a decade of detector R&D for the LHC experiments, much still needs to be done to obtain sensors matching the ILC requirements. While the focus of the LHC-motivated R&D has been on sensor radiation hardness and high trigger rate, the ILC, with its more benign background conditions and lower interaction cross sections, admits sensors of new technology which, in turn, have better granularity, smaller thickness and much improved resolution. Sensor R&D and detector design are being carried out world-wide and are starting deploying prototype detector modules on test beamlines.",

The emphasis on accurate reconstruction of the particle flow in hadronic events and thus of the energy of partons is common to all designs. The main tracker technology drives the detector designs presently being studied. Four detector concepts have emerged, named GLD, LDC, SiD and 4 th Concept. 99 A large volume, 3D continuous tracking volume in a Time Projection Chamber is the centerpiece of the GLD, the LDC and the so-called 4 th Concept designs. The TPC is followed by an highly segmented electro-magnetic calorimeter for which these three concepts are contemplating different technologies A discrete tracker made of layers of high precision Silicon microstrip detectors, and a larger solenoidal field, which allows to reduce the radius, and thus the size, of the calorimeter is being studied in the context of the SiD design. Dedicated detector design studies are being carried out internationally 100,101 to optimise, through physics benchmarks, 102 the integrated detector concepts.

In addition, vertex charge measurements put emphasis on precise extrapolation of particle tracks down to very low momenta. Tagging of events with multiple b jets, such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 H 0 A 0 \u2192 bbbb, discussed in section 1.4.2, underscores the need of high tagging efficiency, \u01eb b , since the overall efficiency scales as \u01eb N b , where N is the number of jets to be tagged. This is best achieved by analysing the secondary vertex structures in hadronic jets. A B meson, from a Higgs boson produced at 0.5 TeV, has an average energy of x B \u221a s/4 \u2243 100 GeV, where x B \u2243 0.7 represents the average b fragmentation function, or a \u03b3 value of \u2243 70.

At the ILC, particle tracks in highly collimated jets contribute a local track density on the innermost layer of 0.2-1.0 hits mm \u22122 at 0.5 TeV, to reach 0.4-1.5 hits mm \u22122 at 1.0 TeV.

An optimal material in terms of Moliere radius is Tungsten, with R M = 9 mm. In four-jet events at \u221a s=0.8 TeV, there are on average 28 GeV per di-jet carried by photons, which are deposited within 2.5 cm from a charged particle at the e.m. calorimeter radius. With pixel cells of order of 1 \u00d7 1 cm 2 to ensure sufficient transverse segmentation and 30 to 40 layers in depth, the e.m. calorimeter would consists of up to 30 M channels and 3000 m 2 of active Si. Due to the large amount of channels and the wish to use an absorber with the smallest possible Moliere radius, the e.m. calorimeter is the main cost-driver of the ILC detector and its optimisation in terms of performance and cost requires a significant R&D effort. A Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter (SiW) was first proposed in the framework of the TESLA study 114,117 and it is currently being pursued by large R&D collaborations in both Europe and the US. Alternative technologies are also being studied by the GLD and the 4 th Concept. This R&D program involves design, prototyping and tests with high energy particle beams and it is being carried out world-wide, [118][119][120] supported by efforts on detailed simulation and reconstruction.",

Its physics program will address many of the fundamental questions of today's physics from the origin of mass, to the nature of Dark Matter. After more than two decades of intense R&D carried out world-wide, the e + e \u2212 linear collider, with centre-of-mass energies up to 1 TeV, has become technically feasible and a costed reference design is now available. Detectors matching the precision requirements of its anticipated physics program are being developed in an intense R&D effort carried out world-wide. Now, theoretical predictions matching the anticipated experimental accuracies are crucially needed, as well as further clues on what physics scenarios could be unveiled by signals that the LHC may soon be observing. These will contribute to further define the physics landscape for the ILC. A TeV-scale electron-positron linear collider is an essential component of the research program that will provide in the next decades new insights into the structure of space, time, matter and energy. Thanks to the efforts of many groups from laboratories and universities around the world, the technology for achieving this goal is now in hand, and the prospects for the ILC success are extraordinarily bright.",
