Measurements were made for exchanged photon virtualities, Q 2 , in the range 10 to 350 GeV 2 . The photons were measured in the transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 4 < E \u03b3 T < 15 GeV and \u22120.7 < \u03b7 \u03b3 < 0.9, and the jets were measured in the transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 2.5 < E jet T < 35 GeV and \u22121.5 < \u03b7 jet < 1.8. Differential cross sections are presented as functions of these quantities. Perturbative QCD predictions give a reasonable description of the shape of the measured cross sections over most of the kinematic range, but the absolute normalisation is typically in disagreement by 20-30%.",

            "text": "Events in which an isolated high-energy photon is observed provide a direct probe of the underlying partonic process in highenergy collisions involving hadrons, since the emission of such photons is unaffected by parton hadronisation. Processes of this kind have been studied in a number of fixed-target and hadroncollider experiments [1]. In ep collisions at HERA, the ZEUS and H1 collaborations have previously reported the production of isolated photons in photoproduction [2][3][4][5][6], in which the exchanged photon is quasi-real, and also in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) [7][8][9], where the virtuality Q 2 of the exchanged virtual photon is greater than 1 GeV 2 . The analysis presented here follows a recent ZEUS inclusive measurement [9] of isolated photons in DIS. Fig. 1 shows the lowest-order tree-level diagrams for highenergy photon production in DIS. Photons radiated by an incoming or outgoing quark are called \"prompt\"; an additional class of photons comprises those radiated from the incoming or outgoing lepton. In this Letter, the inclusive photon measurements in DIS by ZEUS are extended to include the requirement of a hadronic jet. By increasing the ratio of the prompt photon contribution relative to the lepton-radiated contributions, this measurement provides an improved test of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in a kinematic region with two hard scales, which are given by Q and by p jet T , the transverse momentum of the jet or, equivalently, the momentum transfer in the QCD scatter. In particular, the fraction of prompt processes is increased, and a class of jetless non-pQCD processes is excluded in which a soft photon radiated within the proton undergoes a hard scatter off the incoming electron [10]. Compared to a previous ZEUS publication on this topic [7], the kinematic reach extends to lower values of Q 2 and to higher values of the photon transverse energy, E \u03b3 T , and the statistical precision is much improved owing to the availability of nearly three times the integrated luminosity.",

One of these contributions comes from the radiation of a photon from the quark line (called QQ photons; Fig. 1(a), (b)) and a second from the radiation from the lepton line (called LL photons; Fig. 1(c), (d)). In addition to QQ and LL photons, an interference term between photon emission from the lepton and quark lines, called LQ photons by GKS, is present. For the kinematic region considered here, where the outgoing photon is well separated from both outgoing electron and quark, the interference term gives only a 3% effect on the cross section. This effect is further reduced to \u2248 1% when e + p and e \u2212 p data are combined, as the LQ term changes sign when e \u2212 is replaced by e + . The QQ contribution includes photon emission at wide angles from the quark as well as the leading q \u2192 q\u03b3 fragmentation term.",

The uncertainty due to the choice of proton parton distributions is typically much less than 5%. The k T factorisation method used by BLZ [14] takes into account the photon radiation from the lepton as well as the quarks. Unintegrated proton parton densities are used. This procedure gives a quarkradiated contribution that is enhanced relative to the leading-order collinear approximations.
