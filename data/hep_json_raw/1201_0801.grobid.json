In hard local coincidence (HLC) mode, in which both the primary DOM and the nearest or next nearest neighbor DOM report a hit within a \u00b11000 ns time window, full waveform digitization is acquired. If a DOM is in soft local coincidence (SLC) mode without neighboring hits, a reduced waveform data is acquired consisting of the three digitization bins from the first 16 samples: the highest bin and its two neighboring bins. Therefore, hits in this paper mean DOM readouts in HLC plus SLC modes unless specified. Software is used to remove spatially and temporally isolated SLC hits due to noise.

A DeepCore on-line filter is run on the SMT3 triggered event sample at the South Pole. The pass rate is 17.5 Hz. The filtered data are sent north for subsequent processing. The filter algorithm [1] starts by calculating the center of gravity (COG) of all HLC hits in the fiducial volume to get an interaction vertex and time estimate. Then, the filter disregards any events consistent with a cosmic ray muon entering the detector volume by examining the speed between an individual HLC hit in the veto volume and the COG. A factor of 10 reduction in data compared to the triggered events are reached by this algorithm while keeping 99% atmospheric neutrinos that interact in the fiducial volume.

The left plot shows the event rate as a function of the number of hit DOMs. The sum of all Monte Carlo samples is consistent with 281 days of data rate. The cascades are expected to contribute 59% and the tracks are expected to contribute 41%. No atmospheric muon background events are left in 28 hours of simulated data.

In the near future, data analyses using a similar technique as that presented here, focusing on neutrino oscillations, WIMP searches, and neutrino surveys for the southern sky, are expected.",
