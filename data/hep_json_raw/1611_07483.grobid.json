Several Monte Carlo simulation samples in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV were analyzed, and different nondiffractive and diffractive contributions were clarified through differential cross sections of forward neutral particles. Diffraction selection criteria in the VF-triggered-event samples were determined by using the central track information. The corresponding selection applicable in real experiments has \u2248100% purity and 30-70% efficiency. Consequently, the central information enables classification of the forward productions into diffraction and nondiffraction categories; in particular, most of the surviving events from the selection belong to low-mass diffraction events at log 10 (\u03be x ) < \u22125.5. Therefore, the combined method can uniquely access the low-mass diffraction regime experimentally.",

Most of the hard processes can be treated within a theoretical framework based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) owing to the large momentum transfer. However, perturbative QCD is inadequate for describing soft processes such as diffractive dissociation. Instead, the phenomenology of soft hadronic processes based on Gribov-Regge theory [1,2] has been employed to describe these processes at high energies. Therefore, it is extremely important to constrain the phenomenological parameters based on measurement data to obtain a correct a e-mail: zhouqidong@isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp understanding of the various diffractive processes and their accurate contribution to the total inelastic cross section.",

For studies of minimum-bias measurements, this detector can provide information on charged tracks with a p T threshold as low as 100 MeV. The LHCf detectors were installed in the target neutral absorber (TAN) located \u00b1140 m from IP1. The detectors were designed to measure forward neutral particles (e.g., neutrons, photons, and \u03c0 0 s) over a pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| > 8.4. The photon and hadron energy thresholds are 200 and 500 GeV, respectively. The ATLAS-LHCf common data acquisition experiment is dedicated to measuring and classifying diffractive dissociation. Since ATLAS and LHCf have totally different detector acceptances, this common experiment not only enhances the trigger efficiency for inelastic processes but also addresses some specific processes with each other's tagging information.",

The total inelastic cross sections in p-p collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV implemented in each model were 78.984, 80.167, 78.420, and 79.865 mb, corresponding to EPOS-LHC, QGSJET-II-04, PYTHIA8212DL, and SIBYLL2.3, respectively.",

            "text": "The LHCf collaboration has published several forward neutral particle spectra at different collision energies, but no hadronic interaction model can describe the LHCf results perfectly [29][30][31][32]. To address the origin of the differences between the experimental data and the model predictions, separating the VF-triggered events to diffractive and nondiffractive contributions is important. In this analysis, all the events from each simulation are classified into nondiffractive and diffractive collisions by using MC flags, where the SD, DD, and CD events are together treated as diffraction. It is noted that the SIBYLL2.3 model does not implement CD processes. The simulated VF photon and neutron spectra are shown in the top four panels of Figs. 3 and 4 for two fiducial areas, |\u03b7| > 10.94 (left) and 8.81 < \u03b7 < 8.99 (right), respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 5 shows the \u03c0 0 p z spectra at the fiducial p T phase spaces of 0 < p T < 0.2 GeV (left) and 1.2 < P T < 1.4 GeV (right), respectively. The spectra of total, nondiffractive, and diffractive components of four MC samples are compared with each other. In the bottom three panels of Figs. 3, 4, and 5, the ratios of the spectra divided by the EPOS-LHC results are plotted separately for total, nondiffractive, and diffractive components. Clearly, the nondiffraction and diffraction implemented in each model are very different. Especially, PYTHIA8212DL predicts the largest diffractive contribution at high photon energies at |\u03b7| > 10.94 and in the \u03c0 0 p z spectrum at 0 < p T < 0.2 GeV. There is no large difference between models of the neutron total spectra at |\u03b7| > 10.94. In contrast, comparing the individual contribution of nondiffractive and diffractive components, one sees that the neutron spectra of EPOS-LHC and PYTHIA8212DL are dominated by diffraction, but those of QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL2.3 are dominated by nondiffraction at high energies. As shown in Fig. 5, SIBYLL2.3 predicts a larger contribution for all components at 1.2 < p T < 1.4 GeV. It is also found that the larger the value of p T is, the larger is the contribution from all components predicted by SIBYLL2.3. Additionally, in Figs. 4 and 5, neutron and \u03c0 0 spectra of EPOS-LHC and QGSJET-II-04 exhibit a bump or kink structure at \u223c3 TeV. In the EPOS-LHC model, this structure is due to the simple approach used for the pion-exchange process, whereas in QGSJET-II-04 it is due to the selected kinematics, the contribution to which is mainly from low-mass diffraction.",

However, improved experimental techniques have helped in reaching lower p T thresholds and larger rapidity ranges. The results from measurements of rapidity gaps over limited pseudorapidity ranges have been reported by ATLAS [6], CMS [8], and ALICE [9] Collaborations.

It is clear that the efficiency rises as the N track threshold increases. SD selection efficiency, for instance, increases from about 70 to 80% as N track = 0 changes to N track \u2264 5. The efficiency and purity of the central-veto selection for the four criteria are summarized in Table 1. High selection purity (99.5%) is achieved when the criterion is N track = 0 while it decreases only by 5% when N track \u2264 5 is applied. To aid our discussion using a simple analysis, we adopt the following criterion for the central veto (diffraction selection): There are no charged particles (N track = 0) in the kinematic range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 100 MeV.",

A comparison of the VF neutron and \u03c0 0 spectra in the VF regions is shown in Figs. 7 and 9, respectively. They indicate that the spectra corresponding to events surviving central-veto selection keep almost the same shapes as the VF true diffractive spectra. Moreover, the number of misidentified diffractive-like events is very small, as shown by the red histograms. Comparisons of the differential cross sections of surviving events from central-veto selection are shown in the bottom plots of Figs. 8 and 10. The differences among models are expected to be constrained directly by using experimental data. The efficiency and purity of central-veto selection as function of energy were calculated with Eqs. (2) and 3, as shown in Figs. 8 and 10. It is clear that selection purity stays constantly high (at \u2248100%), independent of particle type, energy, and MC simulation model, whereas selection efficiency has a tendency to increase with increasing energy. In contrast to selection purity, selection efficiency exhibits differences among MC simulation models. In particular, the bump structure in EPOS-LHC and QGSJET-II-04 mentioned above still remains on the efficiency spectra. In such a case, comparing measured data with the MC samples as shown in Figs. 7 and 9 can not only constrain the diffraction cross sections in the VF region but also help in identifying the inherent problems in the model.",

To evaluate the performance of VF detectors for the detection of low-mass diffraction, the LHCf detector is considered as representative. The acceptances of the LHCf detector for the forward neutral particles predicted by MC interaction models are shown in Fig. 11. In the region of log 10 (\u03be x ) > \u22125.5, the SD detection efficiency of the LHCf detector is only a few percent. The detection efficiency, however, increases below \u2248 log 10 (\u03be x ) = \u22126 and reaches a maximum of \u223c40% at log 10 (\u03be x ) = \u22128. In contrast, central detectors exhibit a totally opposite tendency of detection efficiency. For instance, the ATLAS detector According to QGSJET-II-04 simulation predictions, most of the events survived from the central-veto selection are from the low-mass diffraction as shown in Fig. 12. In particular, all the low-mass diffractive events at log 10 (\u03be x ) < \u22125.5 detected by VF detector survived from the centralveto selection, whereas all the high-mass diffractive events at log 10 (\u03be x ) > \u22124 were excluded. In the other word, the filled histogram in Figs. 7 and 9 are mostly derived from the lowmass diffractive processes at log 10 (\u03be x ) < \u22125.5. Therefore, the common experiment using VF and central detectors can provide a chance to verify the results of low-mass diffraction reported by TOTEM [10] and impose a constraint on the treatment of low-mass diffraction implemented in MC simulation models through VF neutral particle spectra.

Such a selection has \u2248100% purity, independent of particle type, energy, and interaction model whereas selection efficiency increases from \u223c30 to 70% with increasing energy.
