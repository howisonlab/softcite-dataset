At zeroth order the lifetimes of all weakly decaying b hadrons are equal, with corrections appearing at order 1/m 2 b . Ratios of b-hadron lifetimes can be theoretically predicted with higher accuracy than absolute lifetimes since many terms in the HQE cancel. The latest theoretical predictions and world-average values for the b-hadron lifetimes and lifetime ratios are reported in table 1.

A deviation in the value of \u2206\u0393 d from the SM prediction has recently been proposed [19] as a potential explanation for the anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry measured by the D0 collaboration [20]. In this paper, \u2206\u0393 d /\u0393 d is measured from the effective lifetimes of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * (892) 0 and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S decays, as proposed in ref. [21]. The main challenge in the measurements reported is understanding and controlling the detector acceptance, reconstruction and selection efficiencies that depend upon the b-hadron decay time. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the LHCb detector -2 -",

The combined tracking system provides a momentum, p, measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for charged particles with high transverse momentum, p T . Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [34]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [35]. The right-handed coordinate system adopted has the z-axis along the beam line and the y-axis along the vertical.

All final-state particles are required to have a pseudorapidity in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5. In addition, the z-position of the PV (z PV ) is required to be within 100 mm of the nominal interaction point, where the standard deviation of the z PV distribution is approximately 47 mm.

The decay time of the b-hadron candidate in its rest frame is derived from the relation t = m l/q, where m is its invariant mass and the decay length, l, and the momentum, q, are measured in the experimental frame. In this paper, t is computed using a kinematic decay-tree fit (DTF) [44] involving all final-state tracks from the b-hadron candidate with a constraint on the position of the associated PV. Unlike in the trigger, the position of each PV is calculated using all available charged particles in the event after the removal of the b-hadron candidate final-state tracks. This is necessary to prevent the final-state tracks from biasing the PV position towards the b-hadron decay vertex and helps to reduce the tails of the decay-time resolution function. This prescription does not bias the measured lifetime using simulated events. The \u03c7 2 of the fit, \u03c7 2 DTF , is useful to discriminate between signal and background. In cases where there are multiple b-hadron candidates per event, the candidate with the smallest \u03c7 2 DTF is chosen.

A parameterisation of this efficiency, \u03b5 trigger (t), is obtained for each b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X decay mode by exploiting a corresponding sample of b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X candidates that are selected without any displacement requirement. For each channel, the control sample corresponds to approximately 40% of -10 - the total number of signal candidates. A maximum likelihood fit to the unbinned invariant mass distribution m(J/\u03c8 X) is performed to determine the fraction of signal decays that survive the decay-time biasing trigger requirements as a function of decay time. The same technique is used to determine the decay time efficiency of the triggered candidates caused by the offline selection, \u03b5 selection|trigger (t), which is introduced by the requirement on the detachment of the J/\u03c8 mesons in the sample used to reconstruct the b-hadron decays. The combined selection efficiency, \u03b5 selection (t), is given by the product of \u03b5 trigger (t) and \u03b5 selection|trigger (t). Figure 4 shows \u03b5 selection (t) obtained for the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + channel as a function of decay time. The efficiencies obtained for the other H b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X channels are qualitatively similar. Studies using simulated events show that the efficiency drop below 0.5 ps is caused by the J/\u03c8 displacement requirement. The dip near 1.5 ps appears because the PV reconstruction in the software trigger is such that some final-state tracks of short-lived b-hadron decays may be used to reconstruct an additional fake PV close to the true b-hadron decay vertex. As a result the reconstructed J/\u03c8 meson does not satisfy the displacement requirement, leading to a decrease in efficiency.",

The signal decay time PDF, S t , is obtained by multiplying the exponential function by the combined t-dependent trigger and selection efficiency described in section 4.2. From inspection of events in the sidebands of the b-hadron signal peak, the background decay time PDF, B t , is well modelled by a sum of three exponential functions with different decay constants that are free in the fit. These components originate from a combination of prompt candidates, where all tracks originate from the same PV, and long-lived candidates where tracks from the associated PV are combined with other tracks of long-lived particles. For each channel the exponential functions are convolved with a Gaussian resolution function with width \u03c3 and mean \u2206, an offset of the order of a few femtoseconds that is fixed in the fit. Using a sample of prompt J/\u03c8 background events, the decay time resolution for H b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X channels reconstructed using long tracks has been measured to be approximately 45 fs [47].

The two-dimensional PDF is determined from simulation, while the yield is found to be 6% from the sidebands of the B 0 s sample. This leads to the effective lifetime changing by 0.4 fs, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.

The background distribution is determined by calculating the decay time for each B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decay with respect to a randomly chosen PV from the previous selected event. In studies of simulated events the fraction of this background is less than 0.1%.

To check if the angular acceptance introduced by the detector geometry and event selection can affect the measured lifetime, the events are weighted by the inverse of the angular efficiency determined in ref. [47]. Repeating the fit with the weighted dataset leads to a shift of the lifetime of \u22121.0 fs, the same as is observed in simulation. The final result is corrected by this shift, which is also assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The B 0 s effective lifetime could also be biased due to a small CP -odd S-wave component from B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decays that is ignored in the fit. For the m(K + K \u2212 ) mass range used here (section 3), ref. [51] indicates that the S-wave contribution is 1.1%. The effect of ignoring such a component is evaluated by repeating the fit on simulated experiments with an additional 1% CP -odd component. A change in the lifetime of \u22121.2 fs is observed, which is used to correct the final lifetime and is also taken as a systematic uncertainty. Finally, as described in section 3, only events with a decay time larger than 0.3 ps are considered in the nominal fit. This offset leads to a different relative contribution of the heavy and light mass eigenstates such that the lifetime extracted from the exponential fit does not correspond to the effective lifetime defined in eq. (1.2). A correction of \u22120.3 fs is applied to account for this effect.",

This change in width is larger than the estimated uncertainty on the resolution and leads to a negligible change in the fit results. Consequently, no systematic uncertainty is assigned. Furthermore, to test the sensitivity of the lifetimes to potential mismodelling of the long tails in the resolution, the resolution model is changed from a single Gaussian function to a sum of two or three Gaussian functions with parameters fixed from simulation. Repeating the fit with the new resolution model causes no significant change to the lifetimes and no systematic uncertainty is assigned. The lifetimes are insensitive to the offset, \u2206, in the resolution model. Several consistency checks are performed to study the stability of the lifetimes, by comparing the results obtained using different subsets of the data in terms of magnet polarity, data taking period, b-hadron and track kinematic variables, number of PVs in the event and track multiplicity.

The B 0 s candidates are reconstructed by combining the J/\u03c8 candidate with the K + K \u2212 pair, requiring the invariant mass, m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ), to be in the range [5200, 5550] MeV/c 2 .
