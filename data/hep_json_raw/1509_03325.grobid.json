            "text": "In 1964 Gell-Mann and Zweig [3,4] proposed the quark model to explain the experimental observations in accelerator and cosmic ray experiments of many new strongly interacting particles called hadrons. Originally it was enough to introduce only three quarks u (up), d (down), and s (strange) to correctly describe the charges and spins of observed hadrons. In this model, all the quarks are fermions with spin 1/2 and should have fractional electric charges of 2/3 (in units of the electron charge) for the u-quark and \u22121/3 for the d-and s-quarks. The proton and the neutron are formed from the quark combinations uud and ddu respectively. The masses of the quarks are a few MeV for u-and d-quarks and \u223c100 MeV for the s-quark, based on measured masses of the proton, neutron, \u03c0 and K-mesons, and subsequently on deep inelastic scattering measurements. In 1974 a new meson called J/\u03c8 was observed [5,6] which was quickly interpreted as a bound state of a new quark, c (charm), and its antiparticle, with electric charges \u00b12/3. The charm quark had been predicted theoretically to explain the decay properties of charged and neutral K-mesons through the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [7]. By that time four electrically and weakly interacting particles (electron, electron neutrino, muon, and muon neutrino) were also known, and an interesting symmetric picture appeared containing four quarks, combined into two generations (u, d) and (c, s), and four leptons similarly arrayed in the corresponding (\u03bd e , e) and (\u03bd \u00b5 , \u00b5) generations. In the mid-1970s this symmetry was broken when the \u03c4 lepton was discovered [8] and a new quark, b (bottom), with a mass of about 5 GeV and electric charge \u22121/3 was added to the quark family. The b-quark was inferred from the discovery of the \u03a5 meson at Fermilab [9] at about 10 GeV which was seen to be a bound state of b and b quarks. Subsequent measurements at Cornell, DESY and SLAC confirmed this interpretation. If one assumed that the new lepton and quark belong to a third fermion generation, then to recover the quark-lepton symmetry one needed one more quark and one more neutrino to exist. The new 'top' quark was discovered in 1995, and in 2000 the tau neutrino was observed in \u03c4 -lepton decays in the Fermilab DONUT experiment.",

It is the heaviest known elementary particle, with a mass slightly less than the mass of the gold nucleus and thus does not conform to the original quark conjecture as a simple constituent of hadrons. However, up to now we have no indication of any internal top quark structure; it behaves in all processes as a point-like particle. Two empirical facts distinguish the top from other quarks: its much larger mass and its very small mixing to quarks of the first and second generations. The natural question arises: Why is the top quark so special? Why is it alone in having a mass of approximately the electroweak symmetry breaking scale? In the SM there is no answer to this question.",

            "text": "In another respect the top quark is a unique object. The quark mixing in the SM is encoded in matrix elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [11,12]. The matrix element V tb is close to unity while the elements V ts and V td are significantly smaller than one. These two experimental facts, large mass and small mixing, lead to the conclusion that in the SM the top quark decays to a W boson and b quark with a probability close to 100%. The width of the top is computed in the SM to be about 1.5 GeV [13,14], much smaller than its mass. On the other hand, the top width is significantly larger than the typical QCD scale \u039b \u2248 200 MeV. As a result, the top lifetime (\u03c4 t \u2248 5 \u00d7 10 \u221225 s) is much smaller than the typical time for formation of QCD bound state hadrons (\u03c4 QCD \u2248 1/\u039b QCD \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 \u221224 s). Therefore, the top quark decays long before it can hadronize and hence hadrons containing a top quark are not expected to exist [15]. In this respect the physics of the top quark is much simpler than, for example, the physics of B-hadrons, in which bound states of the b-quark with other quarks and anti-quarks form a rich spectroscopy. However, since the top quark decays before hadronization its properties are not hidden by hadronization effects, and therefore it provides a very clean source for fundamental information. In particular, the SM predicts very specific spin correlation properties. Due to the (V \u2212 A) structure of the charged currents in the SM, the top and anti-top spins in production are strongly correlated and represent a unique experimental probe in the quark sector through the directions of their decay products.",

The quarks hadronize in the detector as collimated sprays of hadrons called jets. If both W 's decay to leptons and neutrinos ( channel), the final state has two leptons, two (b) jets and missing transverse energy (/ E T ) carried by the two neutrinos.

            "text": "Using the ratios of the already observed quark masses, some physicists suggested that the top quark might be about three times as heavy as the b quark, and thus expected that the top would appear as a heavy new meson containing a tt pair, at a mass around 30 GeV. The electron-positron colliders then under construction raced to capture the prize. By 1984 the PETRA e + e \u2212 collider at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Germany reached a center of mass energy of 46.8 GeV and excluded the existence of the top quark with a mass about half of the total center of mass energy or 23.3 GeV [22,23,24]. The e + e \u2212 collider TRISTAN with energy of 61.4 GeV was built at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan in 1986 with the main goal of discovering the top quark. By 1990 experiments at TRISTAN excluded the top quark with mass less than 30.2 GeV [25]. Later, the two e + e \u2212 Z boson factories SLC at SLAC and LEP at CERN started operation, and by about 1990 set a lower limit on m t at   [26,27,28,29]. In the early 1980s, the SppS collider came into operation at CERN with counter-rotating beams of protons and antiprotons colliding with an energy of 540 GeV (later upgraded to 630 GeV). The protons and antiprotons brought their constituent quarks and antiquarks into collision with typical energies of 50 to 100 GeV. Besides the important discoveries of the W and Z bosons, the carriers of the unified electroweak force, the CERN experiments demonstrated another aspect of quarks. Though quarks had continued to elude direct detection, they can be violently scattered in high energy collisions. The high energy quarks emerging from the collision region are subject to the strong interaction, creating additional quark-antiquark pairs from the available collision energy. The quarks and antiquarks so created combine into ordinary hadrons that are seen in the detectors. These hadrons tend to cluster along the direction of the original quark, and are thus recorded as a \"jet\" of rather collinear particles. Such quark jets, previously sensed at SLAC and DESY, were clearly observed at CERN and became a key ingredient in the next round of the top quark searches.",

            "text": "With the advent of the SppS, and in 1988 the more powerful 1800 GeV Tevatron collider at Fermilab, the search for the top quark turned to even higher masses. At the large masses now accessible, the tt bound state was unlikely to form (as the top quark would decay faster than the time needed for binding the quarks into a bound state) so isolated top quarks were expected. For m t < m W , the W boson decay into a top quark and a b quark would predominate. A good channel for the search is W + \u2192 tb \u2192 e + \u03bd e bb and the charge-conjugate process. The main background is QCD production of W bosons and jets. In 1984 the UA1 experiment at the SppS reported evidence for an excess of events with an isolated lepton and two jets, characteristic of a 40 GeV top quark [30]. UA1 observed 6 events (3 with electrons and 3 with muons) with an expected background of less than 1 event. In retrospect, background from bb production was underestimated and the top quark \"observation\" was later ruled out [31,32]. By 1992 the CDF experiment at Fermilab had extended the limit to m t > 91 GeV [33], thus eliminating the possibility for the W \u2192 tb. In 1992, the D0 experiment joined CDF as a long Tevatron run began, culminating with the discovery of the top quark as described in Section 3. Table 1 summarizes the steadily increasing lower limits on m t through 1980s and early 1990s.",

For this run CDF added a new silicon microstrip vertex detector close to the beams that permitted the identification of jets containing a b-hadron that travelled a short distance (a few mm) from the production point, providing a powerful tool for recognition of b-quark jets and suppression of background processes from W +jets and QCD multijet production. Although both collaborations were still setting lower limits on m t , the limits were not much improved as the data samples increased. In the winter of 1992 -1993, both collaborations recorded striking events that conformed to the profile expected for top quark pair events. Both events were in the e\u00b5 dilepton channel which has low background. The CDF event had one of the two jets tagged by its silicon mi-crostrip detector (as well as by a soft muon).

Both collaborations updated their selection criteria to optimize the sensitivity for a top quark with mass in the 150 -200 GeV region. Although there were no interactions between the collaborations on their progress, each knew that the other collaboration was getting close and each began a frenetic push to complete the analyses. An agreement was put in place that when either collaboration presented a paper draft to the Fermilab Director, a one week period would start during which the other collaboration could finalize a paper, and if so, a simultaneous submission for publication would occur. CDF delivered its paper in mid-February and one week later, on February 24, 1995 both collaborations submitted their discovery papers to Physical Review Letters.

CDF relied heavily on its b-tagging capability, and claimed a one in a million probability for the expected backgrounds to produce the observed yield of 6 dilepton events, 21 events with a b quark jet tagged by the vertex detector (with 27 jets tagged) and 22 +jets events tagged by a muon within the jet (with 23 jets tagged), with an estimated background component of 1.3 dilepton events and 6.7 and 15.4 tagged jets for the two categories of single lepton events. D0 used stricter selection cuts based on the topological variables H T , defined as the sum of the scalar E T of the objects in the event, and the aplanarity, which measured the tendency for the momenta of the objects to lie in a plane, to suppress backgrounds. D0 found 3 dilepton events, 8 +jets events with the topological cuts and 6 events with a b jet tagged with a soft muon, with estimated backgrounds of 0.65, 1.9 and 1.2 events respectively for the three categories, with an estimated probability for background to fluctuate to the observed yields of two in a million. For the +jets events a measure of the top mass could be reconstructed from the four-momenta of the observed objects and a fit for the neutrino momentum using the W mass as a constraint. This fitted mass was then compared with a family of Monte Carlo templates with varied input masses to obtain the most likely top quark mass. Figure 2 shows the fitted mass distributions from the discovery papers. CDF obtained a mass of m t = 176 \u00b1 13 GeV and D0 found m t = 199 \u00b1 30 GeV. Using the observed yields and accounting for experimental efficiencies and acceptances, the cross section for tt pair production could be obtained. CDF found \u03c3(tt) = 6.8 +3.6 \u22122.4 pb and D0 obtained \u03c3(tt) = 6.4 \u00b1 2.2 pb. The results were consistent with each other, and with the modern measurements of the mass and cross section. D0 also presented the two-dimensional plot of the mass of two jets (from hadronic W decay) versus the three jet mass (the hadronic top decay) that supported the hypothesis for the decay t \u2192 W b. Both collaborations saw an excess which was a little less than a 5\u03c3 deviation from a background-only hypothesis, but the joint result had more than 5\u03c3 significance and originated the modern standard of requiring 5\u03c3 for a discovery.",

In 2009, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) came into operation using pp collisions, first at 7 TeV, increasing to 8 TeV in 2012 and then to 13 TeV in 2015.

At the Tevatron pp collider, the qq processes account for about 85% of the cross section whereas at the LHC pp, the gg process is dominant (> 80%). Recently the full next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of the inclusive cross sections have been provided [38] with estimated uncertainties of 2.2% (Tevatron) or 3% (LHC) due to higher order contributions. Some differential cross sections at NNLO have also been calculated [39]. Precise measurements of inclusive and differential cross sections can thus give sensitive tests of the SM. Since the top quark decays prior to hadronization, information on the spin correlations and polarizations can also be obtained.",

For the gg process that is dominant at the LHC, the gluons have mainly the same helicities at low m tt and mainly opposite helicities at high m tt .

In the case of the production by the gg process, the distribution as a function of the azimuthal angle difference between decay leptons in dilepton events also carries information on the spin correlation. D0's measurement of the spin correlation in the beam basis is A = 0.85 \u00b1 0.29 using both the lepton + jet and dilepton channels [71].

A D0 determination of the polarization in the beam basis, P= 11.3 \u00b1 9.3%, was made in conjunction with the forward-backward asymmetry measurement in the dilepton channel [61]. Polarization measurements were recently performed by D0 in the + jets channel in the beam (helicity) basis with the, results P= 7.0 \u00b1 5.5%(\u221210.2 \u00b1 6.0%), as well as the parity conserving polarization normal to the scattering plane of P= 4.0 \u00b1 3.4% [77].

A third process in which a top quark is produced in association with W boson has negligible cross section at the Tevatron but becomes important at the LHC as discussed below. The dominant t-channel process proceeds through the exchange of a space-like virtual W boson between a light (u, d, c, s) quark and a b quark.

Somewhat surprisingly, the total electroweak single top quark cross section is about half that for strong interaction tt pair production value of 7.16 pb [38]. The main reason is that the effective mass of the final state products in single top production is about half that for pair production, so that the much more abundant lower momentum quarks and gluons in the interacting proton and antiproton are required. However the smaller number of jets and leptons in single top production compared with tt production makes single top quark detection difficult due to the more copious backgrounds. Thus about 50 times more luminosity and 14 more years were required to discover electroweak single top quark production after the top quark discovery in pair production via the strong force.",

The large W +jets background, with its higher cross section but similar final event topology ( Fig. 7), posed the major challenge. After an initial \"cut based\" events selection on the kinematic parameters of the events, the signal fraction in the analysis sample was only \u22485%, well below the uncertainty on the background prediction. The only option for firmly establishing the existence of the single top quark events was the use of multivariate analysis methods [84,85] which combine tens of event parameters into a single discriminant that provides good separation of signal and background. This discriminant uses not just the difference in signal and background distributions in each parameter but also the correlations among them. The multivariate classifiers were trained on large Monte Carlo samples of signal and background events. Discriminant distributions are shown in Fig. 8 for the CDF and D0 discovery analyses in which single top quark events concentrate at the large values of the discriminant. The discovery of single top quark production not only firmly established that electroweak single top production conforms to the SM prediction, but also verified for the first time that the power of the multivariate analyses could be used for particle physics discoveries. Many subsequent discoveries in particle physics, including that of the Higgs boson, relied heavily on the multivariate methods developed at the Tevatron for the single top quark production observation. These searches also spawned the development of new theoretical tools such as the single top quark event generators [86].",

An interesting feature of the LHC is that about twice as many top as anti-top quarks are produced due to the proton proton initial state (for the Tevatron these numbers are the same). All measured single top quark cross sections and ratios of the top to anti-top cross sections at 7 TeV and 8 TeV LHC energies are in agreement with the SM predictions. The s-channel cross section at the LHC (3.2 pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV [90]) has a relatively small increase over the Tevatron as this process requires quark-anti-quark annihilation (   which only sea quarks at the LHC provide. As backgrounds for the s-channel process increase rapidly with energy, this channel has not yet been observed at the LHC. In addition to the s-channel and t-channel production single top quarks can be produced in association with a W boson, called tW -channel, as shown in the Fig. 11. The cross section for this process at 8 TeV is 22 pb [91]. While this cross section is substantial, top quark pair production creates substantial background. The CMS experiment, using 12 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV collisions and multivariate analysis methods, was able to observe tW associated production with 6.1\u03c3 significance, completing the observation of all leading order processes of single top quark production [92].",

As shown in Fig. 13(a) a simultaneous fit to m t and the jet energy scale factor k JES was made using the W boson mass constraint. The result was m t = 174.98 \u00b1 0.41 (stat) \u00b1 0.63 (syst) GeV. The first world combination of m t measurements was performed in 2014 using BLUE [111,112] and taking into account the correlations between the colliders, experiments, and analysis channels for all sources of systematic uncertainty considered [10]. The combined value is m t = 173.34\u00b10.27 (stat)\u00b10.71 (syst) GeV, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 0.44%. Many of the recent measurements shown in Table 2 were not included in Ref. [10], and substantial improvement is expected for the next world combination.",

A stringent limit on particle-antiparticle mass inequality was obtained for the K 0 \u2212K 0 system: (m K 0 \u2212 mK0)/m K 0 < 0.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 at 90% CL [107], but the SM extensions allow different quark flavors to have different CP T -violating couplings.

Generically, anomalies in a field theory correspond to the situation where some symmetry is present at the level of a classical Lagrangian but is violated at the quantum loop level. Indeed, after a quantization of the SM one finds that the left-and right-handed fermion currents, conserved in accord with Noether theorem at the classical level, are not conserved for individual leptons or quarks at quantum level due to the triangle loop contributions shown in Fig. 17. If an anomaly does not vanish, the theory loses its gauge invariance and therefore cannot be acceptable. (However, in the case of anomaly free fundamental theories such as QED one may consider some currents, for example pseudoscalar fermion pair currents, that respect some global symmetry at the classical level in addition to the local gauge symmetries of the fundamental theory. Anomalies for such currents do not lead to problems. Moreover, this type of anomaly may have very important physics consequences, as in the case of \u03c0 0 decay to two photons.) In the SM there are simultaneous contributions from left and right chiral fermions which contribute to the anomaly with opposite signs.

In the SM, as for any quantum field theory, all the masses and coupling constants get quantum corrections and become so-called running masses and running coupling constants. In particular, the Higgs boson self-interaction quartic coupling \u03bb gets loop corrections coming from the top, Higgs and electroweak gauge boson loops. As a result of the renormalization group evolution, \u03bb becomes a function of the energy scale (renormalization scale \u00b5). The analyses of the running coupling are performed at NNLO accuracy [172], [173], [174]. Because of the running of the Higgs self-coupling, the behavior of the Higgs potential may be changed drastically at high energy scales. Since the effective Higgs potential is proportional to \u03bb(\u00b5) at large \u00b5 or equivalently at large value of the Higgs field, different situations may occur. The quartic coupling \u03bb(\u00b5) may be positive all the way up to the Planck scale leading to an absolutely stable theory. On the other hand, \u03bb(\u00b5) may become negative at large \u00b5, leading to a potential that falls with \u00b5 leading to instability of the theory.

The boundary between stable and meta-stable cases corresponds to a situation where the first and second minima of the potential are equal. The minimum can always be chosen to be zero by a constant shift of the potential. This is equivalent to the condition \u03bb(\u00b5 0 ) = 0 (11) at some scale called the critical point \u00b5 0 = M crit . Because the largest loop corrections in the evolution of \u03bb(\u00b5) are proportional to various powers of the top Yukawa coupling y t , the accuracy of the top quark mass measurement is of special importance. Results of the NNLO analysis are shown in Fig.19  [174]. As one can see, given the uncertainties, the second minimum and critical point could be achieved at the Planck scale. However, a top quark mass of about 171.3 GeV is needed for this to occur. If the top quark mass is heavier, the quartic coupling crosses zero at lower \u00b5. In particular, the value of the top quark mass close to the current measured value m t = 173.1 \u00b1 0.6 GeV leads to the scale \u00b5 \u223c 10 10 GeV for which the quartic coupling becomes negative. Keeping in mind the relation between the Higgs mass and the quartic coupling M 2 h = 2\u03bbv 2 , a bound is obtained for the Higgs mass, assuming the critical point to be the Planck scale [174] ",

Clearly, a better precision of the top quark mass is needed as may be achieved at the LHC, but certainly at a future e + e \u2212 collider. As the precision of the top quark mass measurement becomes substantially smaller than 1 GeV, it will become imperative that the measured mass has a well defined theoretical meaning (see Section 6).

The problem is that the correction depends very strongly (quadratically) on the scale \u039b which may be related to contributions from \"new physics\". If \u039b is very large, (e.g. the Planck scale or even 10 10 GeV), the Higgs  100 GeV is very unnatural. Such a dependence is a specific property of the scalar Higgs boson. Quadratic scale dependences for other SM particles are protected by a symmetry -gauge symmetry for the gauge bosons and chiral symmetry for fermions, but there is no such SM symmetry protecting Higgs quadratic dependence. If one requires the correction to the Higgs mass to be less than the Higgs mass itself, \u03b4M h < M h , one finds the upper limit on the scale \u039b to be slightly less than 1 TeV (the \"little hierarchy\" problem). No new physics particles at this mass scale have been found yet. But since the main contribution to the Higgs mass correction comes from the top loop, one might expect the existence of some rather light top-quark partners, such as stop quarks in supersymmetric models, giving additional loop contributions which may cancel the top loop quadratic behavior on \u039b [180,181,182,183].",

Indeed, in theories like QED or QCD the top quark loop contributions are much smaller than those from light quarks. However, this is not true for the electroweak part of the SM. In previous sections we have seen that due to the large top Yukawa coupling, top loops are very important. For example, the main Higgs boson production channel at the Tevatron or LHC, gluon-gluon fusion, proceeds mainly through a top quark triangle diagram. Also, in the SM the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons W \u00b1 and Z appear due to the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the longitudinal component of the massive vector boson fields come from would-be Goldstone bosons. In the unitary gauge the Goldstone bosons are \"eaten\" by the longitudinal modes. Loop corrections to the electroweak observables are computed in covariant gauges where the interaction vertices of the Goldstone bosons with quarks are involved. These vertices contain terms proportional to the fermion masses, and therefore the loops containing the top quark give the largest contribu-tions. As an example, the loop correction to the W boson mass shown in Fig. 22 due to top quarks depends quadratically on the top mass, while the Higgs boson loop correction depends logarithmically on the Higgs mass. Analysis of these mass corrections provided important limits on the Higgs mass [184] prior to the Higgs discovery by confronting the measured m t and M W with the calculations including these loop corrections, as shown in Fig.23. These limits pointed to the region where the Higgs was subsequently discovered at the LHC [185,186].  The plot in the M W -m t plane from the global fit of precision electroweak measurements by the SM loop level predictions [17] is shown in Fig. 24 ",

In this Section, we review the latest experimental results using the top quark as a window to BSM physics.",

A significant deviation of y t from y SM t \u2248 1 would be a clear indication of BSM phenomena. With the recent addition of the Higgs boson to the family of known particles, it is therefore imperative to measure y t directly, which can be accomplished using the associated production of a Higgs boson and a tt pair, where the Higgs boson is identified through the H \u2192 bb, H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, H \u2192 W W or H \u2192 ZZ decay modes. The first search for ttH(bb) production at a hadron collider was carried out in 2009 by D0 using 2.1 fb \u22121 of data [187]. The best observed (expected) limit at the Tevatron for ttH(bb) is \u00b5 < 17.6 (12.4) in units of the SM expected cross section at 95% CL assuming M H = 125 GeV, obtained by CDF using 9.4 fb \u22121 of data [188]. The best limits at the LHC come from ATLAS and CMS collaborations, both in the ttH(bb) mode. The ATLAS analysis applies a neural network discriminant and a ME method to 20.3 fb \u22121 of data in the +jets and dilepton channels, and obtains an observed (expected) upper limit of \u00b5 < 3.4 (2.2) at 95% CL [189]. Similarly, the CMS analysis obtains an observed (expected) limit of \u00b5 < 4.2 (3.3) at 95% CL by applying a ME method to 19.5 fb \u22121 of data in the + jets and dilepton channels [190]. The results correspond to a fitted \u00b5 = 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 for ATLAS and 1.2 \u00b1 1.6 for CMS, consistent with the SM y t value.",

The simplest extension, the 2 Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) [191], postulates two complex SU(2) L doublet scalar fields rather than one in the SM. This results in eight degrees of freedom, three of which give masses to the SM W and Z bosons, while five manifest themselves as physical particles: two neutral scalars h and H, one pseudoscalar A, and two charged scalars H \u00b1 . Typically, h is assumed to correspond to the discovered Higgs boson. An important parameter of 2HDM models is the ratio tan \u03b2 of the vacuum expectation values of the two SU(2) L doublets. Large tan \u03b2 results in enhanced couplings to third generation fermions of the SM. The couplings of H \u00b1 bosons to SM particles are dominated by the H + tb (and charge conjugate) vertex due to the large top quark mass. Hence, searches for H \u00b1 bosons concentrate on the H + \u2192 tb process if M H \u00b1 > m t , and on t \u2192",

VLQs are defined as quarks with left-and right-handed components transforming identically under SU(2) L . Models with weak isospin singlets, doublets, and triplets have been proposed, where in the doublet case VLQs can occur as up-type quarks (T ) or down-type quarks (B). VLQs predominantly decay to third generation quarks and produce signatures either involving top quarks or resembling them. Typical discrimination variables are H T , defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets and possibly leptons, and the mass of the T , m T , determined through a kinematic fit.",

However, if the W couples only to right-handed particles and if hypothetical right-handed neutrinos are more massive than the W , W \u2192 tb becomes the preferred search channel. Searches have also been performed for a leptophobic W boson with left-handed couplings. Typically, search strategies concentrate on single top-like tb production through the s-channel, and use the invariant mass distribution of the tb system as a discriminant. The first W search with arbitrary couplings was performed by D0 using 2.3 fb \u22121 of data [238], and M W < 800 GeV with purely left-or right-handed couplings were excluded. CDF excluded M W < 900 GeV with purely right-handed couplings using 9.5 fb \u22121 of data as shown in Fig. 26(a), and provides the world's most stringent limits on W with M W < 600 GeV to date [239]. Similar search strategies were applied by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to 20.3 fb \u22121 and 19.5 fb \u22121 of data, resulting in observed (expected) exclusion limits of M W < 1.   [239] at 95% CL are compared to theory predictions for a right-handed W boson with SM-like coupling strengths. The exclusion limits by D0 [238], ATLAS [240], and CMS [241] are also shown.

In 2012, the search for Z resonances using 5.3 fb \u22121 of data [243] by D0 sparked some interest with an excess of 2\u03c3 at m tt \u2248 1 TeV, as shown in Fig. 26(b), resulting in a much weaker observed limit of m Z > 835 GeV compared to an expectation of 920 GeV for narrow resonances. This excess was not confirmed by CDF, which excluded narrow Z bosons up to an observed (expected) limit of m Z > 915 (940) GeV using 9.5 fb \u22121 of data. The sensitivity of such searches dramatically decreases beyond m Z > 1 TeV because the three jets from the t \u2192 W + (q q)b decay can overlap in (\u03b7, \u03c6) and are not resolved as separate objects. This experimental challenge can be addressed by applying jet substructure techniques [244] to identify sub-jets resulting from the t \u2192 W + (q q)b decay products within wide jets. ATLAS performed a search for Z resonances using 20.3 fb \u22121 of data, and obtained observed (expected) exclusion limits of m Z > 1.8 (2) TeV for narrow and of 2.1 (2.2) TeV for wide resonances in Randall-Sundrum scenarios [245]. The search by CMS using 19.7 fb \u22121 of data found observed (expected) exclusion limits of m Z > 2.4 (2.4) TeV for narrow resonances as shown in Fig. 27, and of 2.8 (2.7) TeV for wide resonances in Randall-Sundrum models [246].

The large mass also makes the top quark lifetime very much shorter than the time required to pull new quark-antiquark states out of the vacuum and make hadrons so, uniquely, the top quark can be studied in its bare, un-hadronized form. Despite the top quark's similarities to the other fermions in its basic quantum properties, it stands out as the exotic bird of paradise in the quark family portrait.

Thus we have the prospect of finding new particles such as heavy Z bosons or vector quarks whose decays contain top quarks, or particles such as charged Higgs bosons that could appear in the top decays. In supersymmetric models, the need for cancellation of the large loop contributions arising from the large top quark mass suggests that the companion top squarks should have a lower mass than other sparticle masses, thus making them prime candidates for a first sighting of supersymmetry. Despite the failure so far to find new physics in the production or decays of top quarks, the searches remain highly motivated and will continue to be a dominant theme in the ongoing LHC program.",
