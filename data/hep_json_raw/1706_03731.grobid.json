            "text": "A search for strongly produced supersymmetric particles using signatures involving multiple energetic jets and either two isolated same-sign leptons (e or \u00b5), or at least three isolated leptons, is presented. The analysis relies on the identification of b-jets and high missing transverse momentum to achieve good sensitivity. A data sample of protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , is used for the search. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in several simplified supersymmetric models featuring R-parity conservation or R-parity violation, extending the exclusion limits from previous searches. In models considering gluino pair production, gluino masses are excluded up to 1.87 TeV at 95% confidence level. When bottom squarks are pair-produced and decay to a chargino and a top quark, models with bottom squark masses below 700 GeV and light neutralinos are excluded at 95% confidence level. In addition, model-independent limits are set on a possible contribution of new phenomena to the signal region yields.",

            "text": "This article presents a search for SUSY in final states with two leptons (electrons or muons) of the same electric charge, referred to as same-sign (SS) leptons, or three leptons (3L), jets and in some cases also missing transverse momentum, whose magnitude is referred to as E miss T . Only prompt decays of SUSY particles are considered. It is an extension of an earlier search performed by the ATLAS experiment [22] with \u221a s = 13 TeV data [23], and uses the data collected in proton-proton (pp) collisions during 2015 and 2016. Similar searches for SUSY in this topology were also performed by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV [24][25][26]. While the same-sign or three-lepton signatures are present in many scenarios of physics beyond the SM (BSM), SM processes leading to such final states have very small cross-sections. Compared to other BSM searches, analyses based on these signatures therefore allow the use of looser kinematic requirements (for example, on E miss T or on the momentum of jets and leptons), preserving sensitivity to scenarios with small mass differences between the produced gluinos/squarks and the LSP, or in which R-parity is not conserved. This sensitivity to a wide range of BSM physics processes is illustrated by the interpretation of the results in the context of twelve different SUSY simplified models [27][28][29] that may lead to same-sign or three-lepton signatures. For RPC models, the first four scenarios studied focus on gluino pair production with decays into on-shell (figure 1a) or off-shell (figure 1b) top quarks, as well as on-shell light quarks. The latter are accompanied by a cascade decay involving a\u03c7 1 . The latter, addressed here by looking at a final state with three same-sign leptons, is a model that could explain the slight excess seen in same-sign lepton signatures during Run 1 [30]. Finally, a full SUSY model with low fine-tuning, the nonuniversal Higgs model with two extra parameters (NUHM2) [31,32], is also considered. When the soft-SUSY-breaking electroweakino mass, m 1/2 , is in the range 300-800 GeV, the model mainly involves gluino pair production with gluinos decaying predominantly to tt\u03c7 0 1 and tb\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , giving rise to final states with two same-sign leptons and E miss T . In the case of non-zero RPV couplings in the baryonic sector (\u03bb ijk ), as proposed in scenarios with minimal flavour violation [33][34][35], gluinos and squarks may decay directly to top quarks, leading to final states with same-sign leptons [36,37] and b-quarks (figures 1g and 1h). Although these figures illustrate decay modes mediated by non-zero \u03bb 313 (resp.  Figure 1. RPC SUSY processes featuring gluino ((a), (b), (c), (d)) or third-generation squark ((e), (f)) pair production studied in this analysis. RPV SUSY models considered are gluino pair production ((g), (h), (i), (j)) and t-channel production of down squark-rights ((k), (l)) which decay via baryon-or lepton-number violating couplings \u03bb and \u03bb respectively. In the diagrams, q \u2261 u, d, c, s and \u2261 e, \u00b5, \u03c4 . In figure 1d,\u02dc \u2261\u1ebd,\u03bc,\u03c4 and\u03bd \u2261\u03bd e ,\u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u03c4 . In figure 1f, the W * labels indicate largely off-shell W bosons -the mass difference between\u03c7 \u03bb 321 ) couplings, the exclusion limits set for these scenarios also hold for non-zero \u03bb 323 (resp. \u03bb 311 or \u03bb 322 ), as these couplings lead to experimentally indistinguishable final states. Alternatively a gluino decaying to a neutralino LSP that further decays to SM particles via a non-zero RPV coupling in the leptonic sector, \u03bb , or in the baryonic sector \u03bb , is also possible (figures 1i and 1j). Lower E miss T is expected in these scenarios, as there is no stable LSP, and the E miss T originates from neutrinos produced in the\u03c7 0 1 and top quark decays. Pair production of same-sign down squark-rights 3 (figures 1k and 1l) is also considered. In all of these scenarios, antisquarks decay into the charge-conjugate final states of those indicated for the corresponding squarks, and gluinos decay with equal probabilities into the given final state or its charge conjugate.",

The ID provides precision tracking of charged particles with pseudorapidities |\u03b7| < 2.5 and is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. It consists of silicon pixel and silicon micro-strip detectors inside a transition radiation tracker. One significant upgrade for the \u221a s = 13 TeV running period is the presence of the insertable B-Layer [38], an additional pixel layer close to the interaction point, which provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking and vertexing performance. In the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5, high-granularity lead/liquidargon electromagnetic sampling calorimeters are used. A steel/scintillator tile calorimeter measures hadron energies for |\u03b7| < 1.7. The endcap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with liquid-argon calorimeters for both the electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. The MS consists of three large superconducting toroids with eight coils each and a system of trigger and precision-tracking chambers, which provide triggering and tracking capabilities in the ranges |\u03b7| < 2.4 and |\u03b7| < 2.7, respectively. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [39]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware. This is followed by the software-based high-level trigger, which can run algorithms similar to those used in the offline reconstruction software, reducing the event rate to about 1 kHz.",

The mean number of pp interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) in the data set is 24. After the application of beam, detector and data-quality requirements, the integrated luminosity considered corresponds to 36.1 fb \u22121 . The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is 3.2%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [40], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to model the SUSY signals and to estimate the irreducible SM background with two same-sign and/or three \"prompt\" leptons. Prompt leptons are produced directly in the hard-scattering process, or in the subsequent decays of W , Z and H bosons or prompt \u03c4 leptons. The reducible background, mainly arising from tt production, is estimated from the data as described in section 5.1. The MC samples were processed through a detailed ATLAS detector simulation [41] based on Geant4 [42] or a fast simulation using a parameterization of the calorimeter response and Geant4 for the ID and MS [43]. To simulate the effects of additional pp collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings, inelastic interactions were generated using the soft of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Rapidity is defined as y = 0.5 ln [(E + pz)/(E \u2212 pz)] where E denotes the energy and pz is the component of the momentum along the beam direction. The transverse momentum pT, the transverse energy ET and the missing transverse momentum E miss T are defined in the x-y plane. strong-interaction processes of Pythia 8.186 [44] with a set of tuned parameters referred to as the A2 tune [45] and the MSTW2008LO parton distribution function (PDF) set [46]. These MC events were overlaid onto the simulated hard-scatter event and reweighted to match the pile-up conditions observed in the data. Table 1 presents, for all samples, the event generator, parton shower, cross-section normalization, PDF set and the set of tuned parameters for the modelling of the parton shower, hadronization and underlying event. In all MC samples, except those produced by the Sherpa event generator, the EvtGen v1.2.0 program [47] was used to model the properties of bottom and charm hadron decays.",

All SUSY particles not included in the decay of the pair-produced squarks and gluinos are effectively decoupled. These simplified models assume one production process and one decay channel with a 100% branching fraction. Apart from figure 1j, where events were generated with Herwig++ [51], all simplified models were generated from leading-order (LO) matrix elements with up to two extra partons in the matrix element (only up to one for theg \u2192 qq( /\u03bd\u03bd)\u03c7 0 1 model) using MG5 aMC@NLO 2.2.3 [48] interfaced to Pythia 8 with the A14 tune [50] for the modelling of the parton shower, hadronization and underlying event. Jet-parton matching was realized following the CKKW-L prescription [65], with a matching scale set to one quarter of the pair-produced superpartner mass. All signal models were generated with prompt decays of the SUSY particles. Signal cross-sections were calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft-gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [52][53][54][55][56], except for the RPV models of figures 1k and 1l and the NUHM2 model where NLO cross-sections were used [52,66]. The nominal cross-sections and the uncertainties were taken from envelopes of cross-section pre-JHEP09(2017)084 dictions using different PDF sets and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in refs. [21,57]. Typical pair-production cross-sections are: 4.7 \u00b1 1.2 fb for gluinos with a mass of 1.7 TeV, 28 \u00b1 4 fb for bottom squarks with a mass of 800 GeV, and 15.0 \u00b1 2.0 fb for down squark-rights with a mass of 800 GeV and a gluino mass of 2.0 TeV.",

In regions with large amounts of material in the tracker, an electron (positron) is more likely to emit a hard bremsstrahlung photon; if the photon subsequently converts to an asymmetric electron-positron pair, and the positron (electron) has high momentum and is reconstructed, the lepton charge can be misidentified (later referred to as \"charge-flip\"). To reduce the impact of charge misidentification, signal electrons must satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.0. Furthermore, signal electrons that are likely to be reconstructed with an incorrect charge assignment are rejected using the electron cluster and track properties including the impact parameter, the curvature significance, the cluster width, and the quality of the matching between the cluster and its associated track, in terms of both energy and position. These variables, as well as the electron p T and \u03b7, are combined into a single classifier using a boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm. A selection requirement on the BDT output is chosen to achieve a rejection factor of 7-8 for electrons with a wrong charge assignment while selecting correctly measured electrons with an efficiency of 97%. Correction factors to account for differences in the selection efficiency between data and MC simulation are applied to the selected electrons in MC simulation. These correction factors are determined using Z \u2192 ee events [80].",

Two types of lepton identification criteria are defined: \"tight\", corresponding to the signal lepton criteria described in section 4, and \"loose\", corresponding to candidate leptons after object overlap removal and the charge-flip BDT selection described also in section 4. The matrix method relates the number of events containing prompt or FNP leptons to the number of observed events with tight or loosenot-tight leptons using the probability for loose prompt or FNP leptons to satisfy the tight criteria. The probability for loose prompt leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria (\u03b5) is obtained using a Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 data sample and is modelled as a function of the lepton p T and \u03b7. The efficiencies for electrons (muons) rise from 60% (80%) at low p T to almost 100% at p T above 50 GeV -apart from endcap electrons, for which they reach only 95%. The probability for loose FNP leptons to satisfy the tight selection criteria (FNP lepton rate, f ) is determined from data in SS control regions enriched in non-prompt leptons mostly originating from heavy-flavour hadron decays in single-lepton tt events. These regions JHEP09(2017)084 contain events with at least one b-jet, one well-isolated muon (referred to as the \"tag\"), and an additional loose electron or muon which is used for the measurement.

With this approach, the combined estimate is always dominated by systematic uncertainties, which is not always the case when only the matrix method is used due to small number of events in the control regions. To check the validity and robustness of the FNP lepton estimate, the distributions of several discriminating variables in data are compared with the predicted background after various requirements on the number of jets and b-jets. Examples of such distributions are shown in figure 2, and illustrate that the data are described by the prediction within uncertainties. The apparent disagreement for m eff above 1 TeV in figure 2d is covered by the large theory uncertainty for the diboson background, which is not shown but amounts to about 30% for m eff above 1 TeV.",

The uncertainties in the prompt-lepton efficiency \u03b5 are much smaller. The uncertainties in the FNP lepton background estimated with the matrix method in each VR and SR are then evaluated by propagating the f and \u03b5 uncertainties. In the MC template method, the systematic uncertainty is obtained by changing the generator from Powheg-Box to Sherpa and propagating uncertainties from the control region fit to the global normalization scale factors applied to the MC samples. The uncertainties in these scale factors are in the range 75-80%, depending on the SRs. When combining the results of the MC template method and the matrix method to obtain the final estimate, systematic uncertainties are propagated assuming conservatively a full correlation between the two methods. The uncertainty in the electron charge-flip probability mainly originates from the number of events in the regions used in the charge-flip probability measurement and the uncertainty related to the background subtraction from the Z boson's mass peak. The relative error in the charge-flip rate is below 20% (30%) for signal (candidate) electrons with p T above 20 GeV.",

Additional uncertainties are assigned to some of these backgrounds to account for the theoretical modelling of the kinematic distributions in the MC simulation. For ttW and ttZ, the predictions from the MG5 aMC@NLO and Sherpa generators are compared, and the renormalization and factorization scales used to generate these samples are varied independently within a factor of two, leading to a 15-35% uncertainty in the expected SR yields for these processes.

            "text": "For the RPC models, the limits set are compared with the existing limits set by other ATLAS SUSY searches [23,96]. For the models shown in figure 4, the mass limits on gluinos and bottom squarks are up to 400 GeV higher than the previous limits, reflecting the improvements in the signal region definitions as well as the increase in integrated luminosity. Gluinos with masses up to 1.75 TeV are excluded in scenarios with a light \u03c7 0 1 in figure 4a. This limit is extended to 1.87 TeV when\u03c7 0 2 and slepton masses are inbetween the gluino and the\u03c7 0 1 masses (figure 4c). More generally, gluino masses below 1.57 TeV and bottom squarks with masses below 700 GeV are excluded in models with a massless LSP. The \"compressed\" regions, where SUSY particle masses are close to each other, are also better covered and LSP masses up to 1200 and 250 GeV are excluded in the gluino and bottom squark pair-production models, respectively. Of particular interest is the observed exclusion of models producing gluino pairs with an off-shell top quark in the decay (figure 1b), see figure 4a. In this case, models are excluded for mass differences between the gluino and neutralino of 205 GeV (only 35 GeV larger than the minimum mass difference for decays into two on-shell W bosons and two b-quarks) for a gluino mass below 0.9 TeV. The Rpc3LSS1b SR allows the exclusion of top squarks with masses below 700 GeV when the top squark decays to a top quark and a cascade of electroweakinos    masses in the context of RPV SUSY scenarios with simplified mass spectra featuringgg ord RdR pair production with exclusive decay modes. The signal regions used to obtain the limits are specified in the subtitle of each scenario. All limits are computed at 95% CL. The dotted lines around the observed limit illustrate the change in the observed limit as the nominal signal cross-section is scaled up and down by the theoretical uncertainty. The contours of the band around the expected limit are the \u00b11\u03c3 results, including all uncertainties except theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross-section (\u00b12\u03c3 is also considered in figures 5e and 5f). In figures 5a-5d, the diagonal line indicates the kinematic limit for the decays in each specified scenario. For figures 5e and 5f, theoretical production cross-sections are shown for two different gluino masses in red (1.4 TeV) and blue (2.0 TeV).  Figure 6.

The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . With no significant excess over the Standard Model prediction observed, results are interpreted in the framework of simplified models featuring gluino and squark production in R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating scenarios. Lower limits on particle masses are derived at 95% confidence level. In thegg simplified RPC models considered, gluinos with masses up to 1.87 TeV are excluded in scenarios with a light \u03c7 0 1 . RPC models with bottom squark masses below 700 GeV are also excluded in ab 1b * 1 simplified model withb 1 \u2192 tW \u2212\u03c7 0 1 and a light\u03c7 0 1 . In RPV scenarios, masses of down squark-rights are probed up to md R \u2248 500 GeV. All models with gluino masses below 1.3 TeV are excluded, greatly extending the previous exclusion limits obtained within this search. Model-independent limits on the cross-section of a possible signal contribution to the signal regions are set. Open Access.
