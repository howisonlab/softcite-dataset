This measurement is performed with 3.2 nb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV from 2010 and 0.1 nb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 8 TeV from 2012. A number of aspects of the calorimeter response to isolated hadrons are explored. After accounting for energy deposited by neutral particles, there is a 5% discrepancy in the modelling, using various sets of Geant4 hadronic physics models, of the calorimeter response to isolated charged hadrons in the central calorimeter region. The description of the response to anti-protons at low momenta is found to be improved with respect to previous analyses. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are also examined separately, and the detector simulation is found to describe the response in the hadronic calorimeter well. The jet energy scale uncertainty and correlations in scale between jets of different momenta and pseudorapidity are derived based on these studies. The uncertainty is 2-5% for jets with transverse momenta above 2 TeV, where this method provides the jet energy scale uncertainty for ATLAS.",

It is one of the few low-level measurements that can verify specific aspects of the modelling of the jet response. It also allows a component-wise derivation of the jet energy scale uncertainty and the extension of the uncertainty to high jet transverse momentum ( p T > 1.8 TeV in 2012) where there are too few jets in the data for standard in situ calibration techniques (e.g. dijet or multi-jet balance techniques) to be applied [2]. The response to isolated charged hadrons was measured in ATLAS using data collected in 2009 and 2010 [3] and has been used to evaluate part of the standard ATLAS jet energy scale uncertainty since 2010 [2,4]. The response to charged hadrons also has been used for the calibration of the detector response to hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons [5].",

Between 2010 and 2012, the centre-of-mass energy was increased from 7 to 8 TeV, and the calorimeter conditions changed as the calorimeters were repaired and recalibrated. In particular for comparisons sensitive to these changes, both 7 and 8 TeV data are presented. Generally, the conclusions are consistent between the two years. The detector simulation includes significant improvements in the detector description [6,7] and makes use of new models of hadronic physics in Geant4 [8]. Several variations of the inclusive response measurement are used to validate key aspects of the modelling of energy reconstruction in the calorimeter. As in Ref. [3], the decays of identified particles are used to identify the type of particle entering the calorimeter (e.g. \u03c0 \u00b1 , proton, or antiproton), in order to further validate the details of the hadronic physics models.",

Many particles are not sufficiently energetic to reach the calorimeter, and some particles interact before reaching the calorimeter and do not deposit a significant amount of energy. The fraction of particles not depositing energy in the calorimeter is the first important test of the geometry (i.e. description of the detector material distribution) and simulation of hadrons, discussed in Sect. 4.1. The energy deposited in the calorimeter is then grouped into topological clusters. The procedure by which the clusters are constructed should not bias the energy measured in the calorimeter; this is explored in Sect. 4.4.1. These topological clusters can be calibrated to the hadronic scale, and the way in which the calibration affects the calorimeter energy measurement is discussed in Sect. 4.4.2. The construction of topological clusters involves an energy threshold, which differs between different data-taking periods at the LHC. The effect of changing these thresholds on the measured response is explained in Sect. 4",

Some jets may be composed of more positively or more negatively charged particles, resulting in differences in response. The separate modelling of positively and negatively charged particles is discussed in Sect. 4.4.3. Because hadrons may interact early or late in the calorimeter, jets may not be regularly distributed longitudinally. The description of the separate calorimeter layers is discussed further in Sects. 4.4.5 and 4.4.6. A number of different hadron species can contribute to jets. Their charged components are primarily charged pions, charged kaons, and (anti-)protons. The responses of these individual species of hadrons are discussed further in Sect. 5. These results primarily build confidence in the extrapolation from simple isolated-hadron configurations to complex jet configurations.",

The jet energy scale uncertainty, derived in this manner, is applicable only to the particular set of jets used in the derivation. Just as in the case of the other in situ uncertainty estimations, additional uncertainties that depend on the details of the jet selection must be considered. One of these is an uncertainty due to the modelling of additional protonproton collisions (pile-up) simultaneous with the collision of interest. Historically, although searches for new physics and measurements of the Standard Model are almost always performed in events with pile-up, isolated hadron response studies have always been performed in events with low or no pile-up. In Sect. 4.4.4, the calorimeter response to isolated charged hadrons in events with pile-up is discussed. These studies are sufficiently promising that future studies of the calorimeter response to isolated charged hadrons might be performed in larger data sets, including events with pile-up.",

The ID consists of silicon pixel and strip (SCT) tracking detectors covering |\u03b7| < 2.5 and a straw-tube tracker (TRT) covering |\u03b7| < 2.0, all immersed in an axial 2 T magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. A typical central track includes three measurements (hits) in the pixel detector, eight hits in the SCT, and 35 hits in the TRT. Below |\u03b7| = 0.6, a particle passes through approximately 0.5 radiation lengths (0.2 interaction lengths) of material before reaching the calorimeter. Between |\u03b7| = 0.6 and |\u03b7| = 1.8, the amount of material in the ID rises from 1.5 radiation lengths (0.4 interaction lengths) to a maximum of almost 2.5 radiation lengths (0.7 interaction lengths). The sampling calorimeter is hermetic out to |\u03b7| = 4.9 and is generally divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.4), endcap (1.4 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward (3.2 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 4.9) regions. The highly-segmented electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter uses liquid argon (LAr) with lead or copper absorber material and includes three longitudinal sampling layers in addition to a presampler for |\u03b7| < 1.8. The hadronic calorimeter uses scintillator tiles with steel absorber in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.7) and LAr with copper (tungsten) absorber in the endcap (forward) region.",

[3], but they were subsequently reanalysed with improved understanding of the detector (e.g. improved knowledge of the detector material and alignment). Both of these samples were collected during periods in which the fraction of events with pile-up was negligible.

To study issues related to pile-up, an additional data sample from 2012 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 551 nb \u22121 , which has approximately 15 proton-proton collisions per event on average and collisions every 50 ns. This data sample includes some effects from both in-time pileup, collisions simultaneous to the collision of interest, and out-of-time pile-up, collisions in bunch crossings before or after the collision of interest.

These two sets of hadronic physics models also differ in the models applied to anti-hyperons and anti-baryons, which in particular leads to an expected difference in the modelling of the calorimeter response to anti-protons.",

This algorithm suppresses noise by forming energy clusters around seeds with at least four times larger (in absolute value) signal than the average noise, which includes both the electronic noise and the pile-up contributions. The threshold is defined by the width of the energy distribution in a cell in an MC simulation sample containing a fixed amount of pile-up (e.g. \u03bc = 30). All neighbouring cells with at least twice larger signal than the average noise are added to the clusters, and a final layer of cells at the boundary of the cluster is added without any noise threshold requirement. This final layer improved the energy resolution in single-particle studies with the ATLAS calorimeter test beam [29]. After this procedure, clusters may be split if there are several local maxima of energy found within them. Because the cell energy requirements are on the magnitude of the signal, negative energy clusters are possible. The topological clusters are not calibrated beyond a correction for the sampling fraction of an electron shower in the calorimeter; no correction is applied for non-compensation or energy loss outside of the sampling portion of the calorimeter.

            "text": "The construction of the E/ p variable is illustrated in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows several examples of the E/ p distributions for data and MC simulations with both sets of hadronic physics models. The distributions are normalised to have unit area. Examples are given for two track momentum bins in the central region of the calorimeter, for data with low \u03bc and a higher |\u03b7| region, and for data in the central region of the calorimeter with higher \u03bc . In these distributions, no requirement is made on the number of TRT hits associated to the track. The mean of the distribution is significantly less than one because of the loss of some energy outside of the clusters included in the definition of E and the noncompensating response of the calorimeter. The large fraction of tracks with E/ p = 0 corresponds to tracks without an associated topological cluster in the calorimeter. This can happen if either a particle interacts hadronically before reaching the calorimeter or no single energy deposit is large enough to seed a topological cluster [3]. The negative tail of these distributions is caused by noise in the calorimeter, which for data taking conditions with low \u03bc consists mostly of electronics noise, while the long positive tail is caused by the background of neutral particles, since these particles add to the measured E but not to p. In events with significant amounts of pile-up, such as those shown in Fig. 2d, the positive tail from in-time pile-up can be quite large, and the negative tail is enhanced by several orders of magnitude due to the impact of out-of-time pile-up. At low |\u03b7|, the MC simulation underestimates the negative E tail from noise; however, this tail is only a very small fraction of the distribution. In the same |\u03b7| region but at higher momenta, the amount of energy from neutral-particle backgrounds is overestimated by the MC simulation, as can be seen from the high E/ p region in Fig. 2b. The fraction of the distribution with E \u2264 0 can be further examined to understand features of the geometry, hadronic interaction models, and noise modelling. No requirement is placed on the number of TRT hits associated to the track for these distributions in order to include particles that may have undergone a hadronic interaction earlier in the ID. This fraction for inclusive charged particles is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of track momentum and |\u03b7| separately for tracks of positive and negative charges. The bin edges in |\u03b7| in these distributions follow geometric features of the calorimeters. The 2010 and 2012 data are shown separately and display similar features. This fraction is directly displayed as a function of the number of traversed interaction lengths of material as described by the geometry of the simulation in Fig. 4 for tracks with 1.2 < p/ GeV < 1.8. The fraction of the distribution with E \u2264 0 increases with |\u03b7| and interaction lengths, as the detector material increases, and decreases with momentum. Differences between the two charge distributions are clearly visible, particularly at low momenta. These differences are closely related to the population of particle  Detector noise, which is largely symmetric, drives the portion of the response distribution with E < 0. This region is dominated by particles that did not have any significant energy deposited in the calorimeter. Thus, the tail can be used to further examine the modelling of calorimeter noise   Figure 5 shows the ratio of the number of tracks with associated E < 0 to those with no associated clusters of energy as a function of track momentum -this is an approximation of the relative rate at which particles with low momenta, or which have scattered before reaching the calorimeter, coincide with a sufficiently large amount of noise that a negative-energy topological cluster is formed. In general, additional detector material in the simulation should manifest itself as a higher E = 0 rate in the simulation than in the data, but this effect is cancelled in the ratio. The ratio shows a disagreement at the 10% level in the central region of the calorimeter, but the data and MC simulation are consistent in a more forward region 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 1.1. Further forward |\u03b7| bins indicate 10%-level disagreements.",

Such late showering hadrons are selected by requiring that they leave less than 1.1 GeV in the EM calorimeter inside a cone of size R = 0.1 around their track. They are further required to have energy deposited in the same cone in the hadronic calorimeter that is at least 40% and less than 90% of the track momentum. The energy deposited by close-by neutral particles is then measured in the EM calorimeter in the region 0.1 < R < 0.2 around the MIP particle's track. A geometric factor of 4/3 is applied to estimate the energy deposits from the neutral-particle background in the whole R = 0.2 cone. The mean of this background distribution over many events in a given track momentum and pseudorapidity bin, E/ p BG , estimates the energy deposited by photons and neutral hadrons in the EM calorimeter. This selection is illustrated in Fig. 1. Using a similar method with the individual layers of the hadronic calorimeter, the energy deposited by the background particles in the hadronic calorimeter was found to be negligible. As described in Ref. [3], an alternative method that used information about the shape of the hadronic shower was used to estimate the neutral-particle background.

These differences are attributed to the phenomenological models used to describe non-perturbative QCD processes in Pythia8, as well as the difficulty of correctly modelling the calorimeter response to low-momentum neutral particles. They do not strongly indicate a deficiency in the detector description, which would typically be isolated in a narrow region of |\u03b7| away from the well-understood central ID region. The broad discrepancy as a function of |\u03b7| shown in Fig. 7d is consistent with a deficiency in the modelling of coherent neutral particle radiation in Pythia8, as the background is consistently and significantly higher in the MC simulation than in the data. Provided the neutral-particle background is correctly accounted for separately in data and MC simulation, however, any imperfection in the modelling of neutral particles can be removed from the comparison of calorimeter response.

Another part may be due to poor modelling of secondary particles from hadronic interactions that occur before the calorimeter, as suggested in Sect. 3. Tracks that do not have a large number of hits in the TRT are likely to result from particles that have undergone hadronic interactions while propagating through the ID. The large scattering angles of secondary charged particles, as well as the rate of secondary neutral particles, both contribute to the original track not being extended to the face of the calorimeter. Thus, examining tracks with a small number of hits in the TRT provides information about particles that likely underwent hadronic interactions. A comparison of the E/ p COR for tracks that do not have a large number of hits in the TRT with those that do is shown in Fig. 8. The E/ p COR for tracks without a large number of TRT hits is  very poorly modeled by the simulation, showing 25%-level discrepancies at low momenta, suggesting problems with the description of secondary particles from these relatively lowenergy nuclear interactions. For tracks with a large number of TRT hits, there remains a 5-10% discrepancy. This dis-crepancy, which is smaller for 2012 data than in the case of 2010 data, is explored in subsequent sections of the paper. For the remainder of the paper, more than 20 hits are required in the TRT, in order to suppress tracks from particles that undergo nuclear interactions before the calorimeter. , where the background is well modeled for the same momenta but the material in front of the calorimeter is substantially larger, the MC simulation describes the data to within the uncertainties.

In order to provide a subtraction of the appropriate background contribution, the background is also calculated using cells instead of clusters.

These distributions agree within the statistical uncertainties for central |\u03b7|, demonstrating an excellent modelling of the effect of topological clustering on the calorimeter response distri-bution.

The local cluster weighting (LCW) technique [2] applies a calibration to the topological cluster energy according to the position and properties of the energy depositions in the topological cluster (e.g. depth in the calorimeter and energy density) in order to account for these effects. Figure 11 shows a comparison of the LCWcalibrated E/ p COR in data and simulation, both including and omitting tracks with E = 0. When calculating E/ p COR with the LCW calibration, the same calibration method is applied to the clusters used to determine the background. The response is significantly higher than that of Fig. 9a due to the calibration, since the calibration raises the average  Fig. 11 Comparison of the E/ p COR calculated using LCWcalibrated topological clusters as a function of track momentum, corrected for the neutral-particle background, for tracks with |\u03b7| < 0.6, and a zero or more associated topological clusters or b one or more associated topological clusters.

The bottom portion of each panel shows the ratio of MC simulation to data, separately for the two sets of hadronic physics models, and separately for 2010 and 2012 data. The error bars represent statistical uncertainties suggesting a discrepancy in the description of hadronic interactions before the sampling portion of the calorimeter. The calibrated response to single particles, which is not unity with either of these selections, is a result of imperfections in the calibration procedure. Nonetheless, the momentum dependence of the response is almost completely removed by the LCW calibration when considering tracks with at least one associated topological cluster. As the discrepancies between MC simulation and data are most critical for the studies presented here and the LCW calibration does not affect these discrepancies significantly, in the remainder of this paper the EM-scale response is used for almost all comparisons.

At low momenta the models are identical, and at high momenta they are tuned to the same thin-target data. For negatively charged tracks, some difference between QGSP_BERT and FTFP_BERT is observed. This difference is primarily due to the difference in the modelling of the response to anti-protons, as is suggested by Fig. 13, which compares the E/ p distributions for negatively charged and positively charged tracks in a low-momentum bin. The two sets of hadronic physics models show identical distributions for positively charged tracks and show a clear discrepancy for negatively charged tracks with E \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 p.

The charged-particle background from pile-up can still be removed using the track isolation requirement. Moreover, fluctuations of the neutral-particle background significantly worsen the energy resolution for low-momentum particles. Nonetheless, as the background subtraction technique in this paper depends only on the average background distributions, the (pile-up and background-corrected) E/ p COR can still be measured in events with pile-up, in this case also binned in \u03bc and the number of reconstructed vertices. To ensure a fair comparison, all data and MC simulation samples used in these comparisons are reconstructed with consistent calorimeter thresholds corresponding to \u03bc = 30.",

There is a clear dependence in both the raw and background distributions. The difference is almost completely removed, however, in the E/ p COR distribution. After the background subtraction, the values are also in good agreement with those calculated in the low-\u03bc dataset. In each case, similar trends are present in both data and MC simulation. In the MC simulation with pile-up, the events are weighted such that the \u03bc distribution matches that of the data, in order to ensure that out-of-time pile-up contributions are well modeled.

Energy deposits up to 100 ns after, and up to 800 ns before the collision of interest may affect the energy measured in a calorimeter cell. Thus, an equally important test is the stability of the response to isolated charged hadrons against the average number of protonproton collisions per bunch crossing, \u03bc .

Again, there is a dependence in both the raw and background distributions, while the E/ p COR distribution shows that the pile-up is well compensated for by the background subtraction scheme.

During most of the data-taking period in 2012, however, a different calorimeter noise threshold setting was applied when defining topological clusters. This higher threshold serves to suppress pile-up, while lowering the clustering efficiency for true energy deposits. A comparison of the raised threshold used for most of 2012 (corresponding to \u03bc = 30) to the threshold used during the low-\u03bc data-taking period (corresponding to \u03bc = 0) in the same dataset is shown in Fig. 19. When including a higher threshold, as expected, a higher fraction of tracks are not associated with a topological cluster because a more significant energy deposit is required to seed a cluster. This manifests as a significant drop in the average response at low momentum. At high momentum ( p > 6 GeV), however, and when considering only tracks that match to at least one topological cluster, agreement between the two threshold settings is typically within 10%. As most pile-up consists of low-momentum particles, this is an indication that the higher threshold setting is successful at rejecting pile-up, while keeping and not altering the  When excluding tracks that do not match any cluster, at low momentum the higher minimum cluster energy increases the average response, because the majority of tracks match only one cluster. At moderate momenta (2 < p/ GeV < 7), most tracks match more than one cluster, and a low-energy cluster is cut away by the higher threshold, resulting in a reduction in E/ p COR .

These distributions are normalised, so that their shapes can be compared without regard to the yield differences that are discussed in Sect. 5.2. As in the inclusive hadron response studies, a small fraction of the identified tracks have negative values of E/ p. The energy in this distribution has a long positive tail due to the neutral background. The population of identified anti-protons with E/ p > 1 is much more prominent because of the annihila-tion of the anti-proton, which leads to a significantly greater calorimeter response to anti-protons than to pions or protons. The response distribution is well reproduced by the MC simulation to within the statistical precision.",

The fraction is large at low available energy, and the level of agreement between data and MC simulation reflects the modelling of the material in front of the calorimeter. This fraction compared between particle species is shown in Fig. 25, in data and simulation with the FTFP_BERT set of hadronic physics models. The QGSP_BERT set of hadronic physics models provides a similar description of the data. This fraction is underestimated by the MC simulation by approximately 10% at low E a , with larger discrepencies for protons and anti-protons, although the available statistics in data and MC simulation are limited. This suggests that the source of the discrepancy in the fraction of tracks with E \u2264 0 is not from the hadronic-interaction model for one particle species, but is caused by an effect present for all particle species.",

            "text": "In order to reduce the effect of the neutral background, the average responses, E/ p , are measured as differences between pairs of particle species. The averages are just the arithmetic means of the E/ p distributions. The difference between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 is shown in Fig. 26, for two bins of pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.6 and 0.6 < |\u03b7| < 1.1). The response to \u03c0 + is greater on average than the response to \u03c0 \u2212 at low energy, which agrees with Ref. [32], where the difference is attributed to a charge-exchange effect (i.e. the production of additional neutral pions in showers initiated by \u03c0 + ). The simulation models the data well, with some trend to underestimate the difference, although there are large statistical uncertainties at high available energy. Figure 27 shows the difference between the response to protons and \u03c0 + for two pseudorapidity bins. The response to protons is lower than the response to pions on average because a larger fraction of the initial energy is converted into an electromagnetic shower for pions [33,34]. This is evident in the E/ p difference, where the response to pions is about 10% greater on average. The data and MC simulation are fairly consistent, though there are large statistical uncertainties because of the low number of identified protons. Figure 28 shows the difference between the response to anti-protons and \u03c0 \u2212 for two pseudorapidity bins. The response to anti-protons is expected to be significantly larger than the response to pions at low available energy, because of the annihilation of the anti-proton in the calorimeter. While the difference in response at low E a is small for the  QGSP_BERT set of hadronic physics models, because of a different model used to estimate anti-baryon nuclear interactions in the FTFP_BERT set of hadronic physics mod-els [14], the response to anti-protons is about 20% greater.

In Fig. 33, the particle spectrum provided by Pythia8 is convolved with the calorimeter response to isolated charged hadrons measured in the data, extrapolated to higher energy where necessary. As these measurements are at the EM scale, photons are assumed to have a calorimeter response of 1 in this study. Based on MC simulation, protons and neutrons at high energy (above 20 GeV, cf. Fig. 30) are assumed to have the same response. All hadrons at high energy are given a response of 0.78, in agreement with the combined test beam results at high particle energy [38]. The jet energy response is then formed as the ratio of the jet energy after this convolution to the energy prior to convolution. For this study, jets are labeled as light-quark-initiated (quark) or gluon-initiated (gluon) according to the highestenergy parton matched to the jet, following Ref. [2]. The difference in response between light-quark and gluon jets is 7% at low jet p T , falling to 1% at high p T . This is consistent with the difference derived from the simulated calorimeter response to jets in Ref. [2]. Differences with jets containing a b-hadron (b-jets) are also visible in this figure: these jets appear more like gluons at low p T and more like light quarks at high p T . For simplicity, this study is restricted to jets with central |\u03b7|, but as the differences in jet properties persist at higher |\u03b7|, the differences in response discussed here also persist. For the jet response and uncertainty, the important quantity is the fraction of jet energy carried by particles in several momentum ranges. This determines what the most important measurements are, through the convolution of particle-level response and uncertainties into jet-level response and uncertainties. The fractions for several jet p T bins are shown in Fig. 34. The p T bin ranges correspond to the region covered by only the E/ p COR studies in this paper ( p T < 20 GeV), the region covered by both these measurements and the combined test beam (20 < p T / GeV < 30), the region covered by only the combined test beam (30 < p T / GeV < 350), and the region that is uncovered by these measurements ( p T > 350 GeV). Some structures are visible in this figure, in The fractional contribution to the total jet energy of particles in a certain range of momenta, for particles inside anti-k t , R = 0.4 jets with a 90 < p T / GeV < 100, b 400 < p T / GeV < 500, and c 1800 < p T / GeV < 2300 particular in the 20 < p/ GeV < 30 bin of particle momentum. The first structure corresponds to jets with exactly one such particle, the second structure to jets with two, and so on. The narrow momentum range of that particular bin leads to a clearer structure than in the other cases. The average fraction as a function of jet p T is shown in Fig. 35. As expected, the EM fraction of the jet is roughly constant as a function of the jet p T , and the contribution from high-momentum particles increases with jet p T . Within the MC simulation, it is possible to isolate the contribution to the energy deposited in the calorimeter from each individual particle in the jet. Figure 36 shows the spectrum of this energy deposited in the calorimeter within a jet, separated by the species of particle that caused the energy deposition. In this figure, the entire energy from the shower of a positively charged pion is all considered part of the \u03c0 + category, even if the energy was deposited by an electron that was created in the calorimeter, for example. The result is qualitatively sim-ilar to the spectrum from the generator-level particles in the jet (cf. Fig. 32), but this is a more accurate reflection of the particles that contribute to the jet's response. Thus, it is this spectrum that is convoluted with the uncertainties described below in order to derive a jet energy scale uncertainty.",

The uncertainty derived in this manner is applicable to data taken with a calorimeter threshold setting of \u03bc = 30, but without any pile-up. Based on these effects, the jet energy scale uncertainty is extracted. Each term is treated as an independent Gaussiandistributed uncertainty, and pseudo-data are used to determine both the full uncertainty and the size of the uncertainty correlations between jets with different p T and |\u03b7|. The final jet energy scale uncertainty is shown in Fig. 37, with a detailed breakdown of the largest components of the jet energy scale uncertainty. The dominant components of the uncertainty, by far, are the uncertainty from the in situ E/ p COR measurement (for p T < 600 GeV) and the uncertainty from particles that are outside the range probed by the test beam (for p T > 600 GeV). In the central region of the detector (|\u03b7| < 0.6) and for jets of moderate p T , the uncertainty derived in this manner is about twice as large as the uncertainty derived with in situ methods [2], though it is comparable to the uncertainty derived with MC simulationbased methods [4]. 4 However, this is the only estimate of the , and thus provides a critical component for many physics analyses. It also serves as a complementary study of the in situ jet response and uncertainty that strengthens the understanding of the modelling of the measurement of hadronic showers by the MC simulation. The pseudo-data are also used to explore the correlations in uncertainty of jets at different p T in the central region. The correlation is defined between the average reconstructed jet p T in a given bin of p T and |\u03b7| and is shown in Fig. 38. Jets at similar momenta are correlated, though the differences in average properties lessens these correlations. At high p T and high |\u03b7|, because the jets are dominated by the \"Hadrons, p > 350 GeV\" term, the correlation becomes stronger. These correlations are calculated using the average jet response in an MC simulation sample made using the QGSP_BERT set of hadronic physics models. The properties of the jets in this sample, for example the energy deposited in a given layer of the calorimeter, is dependent on the sample. Therefore, the strength of these correlations may be different in a different MC simulation sample, or indeed in the data.",

This measurement is compared to the Footnote 4 continued analysis-dependent, for example uncertainties on the fragmentation of jets, that are not included here. These uncertainties are derived separately and applied on top of the other uncertainties. The uncertainty derived in this paper is most comparable to the \"in situ\" terms of the jet energy scale uncertainty from Ref.

After background subtraction, some discrepancy is observed in the response to charged hadrons in the central calorimeter at the level of 5%.
