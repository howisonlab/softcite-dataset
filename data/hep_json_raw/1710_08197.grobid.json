This system allows for a broad range of studies of fundamental discrete symmetries including tests which are only feasible with entangled neutral mesons. This work reports on the Lorentz non-invariance and CPT violation searches with the \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Moreover, status and results of quantum coherence tests with the same process are discussed. Finally, the status of ongoing direct tests of T and CPT in neutral kaon transitions is presented. For each of the reported studies, perspectives are discussed for the KLOE-2 experiment, which is presently taking data.",

            "text": "Systems of flavoured neutral mesons have long proven to constitute an excellent ground for studies of the fundamental discrete symmetries of Nature as conservation of the latter can be easily translated to constraints on the properties of such systems. Among them, neutral kaons are of special importance as the value of the mass difference between K 0 andK 0 state enables the use of quantum-entangled pairs of neutral K mesons to observe a range of quantum intereference phenomena. Such interferometric measurements may also be used to design tests of discrete symmetries and quantum mechanics as has been shown by the KLOE experiment, which to date is the sole experimental setup where K 0K0 pairs are available in a quantum entangled state, provided by the DA\u03a6NE \u03c6-factory. Presently, the physics programme is continued by the KLOE-2 detector. This work reports on the recent tests of both discrete symmetries and quantum coherence performed by KLOE and the perspectives for KLOE-2 results.",

The detection setup common for KLOE and KLOE-2 consists of a cylindrical drift chamber (DC) [1] and a sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) surrounding it with a coverage of 98% of 4\u03c0 [2]. The DC uses a light gas mixture to minimize kaon regeneration and its size with an outer radius of 2 m is driven by the need to detect a large part (40%) of decays of the K L mesons, whose mean path in KLOE is about 3.4 m. The calorimeter provides good timing resolution which is used to reconstruct the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2192 6\u03b3 decays based on the \u03b3 interaction points in the EMC [3]. Additionally, the KLOE-2 uses a novel Inner Tracker device based on 4 layers of Cylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier detector aiming at improving tracking and vertexing resolution close to the interaction point [4].",

To account for direction dependence, the events were divided into two angular subsamples based on the projection of the momentum of the more energetic of two kaons on the \u03c6 direction in the laboratory reference frame. Consequently, daily movement of the laboratory was expressed in the frame of fixed stars and the data sample was further split into 4 intervals of sidereal time. For each of the eight obtained subsamples of K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events, the double decay rate (Eq. 2) was fit simultaneously in order to extract the \u2206a \u00b5 SME parameters of the kaon sector. The results, presented in Table 1, reach the expected sensitivity at the level of 10 \u221218 GeV [8], which is several orders of magnitude more precise than results obtained with other neutral meson systems [9]. Moreover, further improvement is expected with the KLOE-2 detector due to its goal integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 as well as the enhanced tracking capabilities. Expected KLOE-2 statistical uncertainty is shown in Table 1. ",

Moreover, a novel test of time reversal and CPT symmetries is in progress using the data collected by the KLOE-2 detector, which is presently in operation. KLOE-2 will bring not only larger statistics of at least 5 fb \u22121 but also improved event reconstruction due to new detector components such as the Inner Tracker. These factors are expected to improve sensitivity of all the reported tests.",
