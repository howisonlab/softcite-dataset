            "text": "Hard exclusive electro-and muoproduction of mesons on nucleons has played an important role in studies of strong interactions and recently gained renewed interest as it allows access to generalised parton distributions (GPDs) [1][2][3][4][5]. The GPDs provide a novel and comprehensive description of the partonic structure of the nucleon and contain a wealth of new information. In particular, they embody both nucleon electromagnetic form factors and parton distribution functions. Furthermore, GPDs provide a description of the nucleon as an extended object, referred to as 3-dimensional nucleon tomography [6][7][8], which correlates longitudinal momenta and transverse spatial degrees of freedom of partons. The evaluation of GPDs may for the first time provide insight into angular momenta of quarks, another fundamental property of the nucleon [2,3]. The mapping of nucleon GPDs, which very recently became one of the key objectives of hadron physics, requires a comprehensive program of measuring various hard exclusive processes in a broad kinematic range, in particular deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Hard exclusive meson production provides independent and complementary information.",

In this case the amplitude for hard exclusive meson leptoproduction can be factorised into a hard-scattering part and soft parts, the latter depending on the structure of the nucleon described by GPDs and on the structure of the meson described by its distribution amplitude (DA). No similar proof of factorisation exists for transverse virtual photons.

The GPDs are functions of t, x and \u03be, where t is the squared four-momentum transfer to the nucleon, x the average and \u03be half the difference of the longitudinal momenta carried by the struck parton in the initial and final states. In addition, there is a scale dependence of GPDs which is not explicitly shown here. Depending on the quark content and the quantum numbers of the meson, there exists sensitivity to various types of GPDs and different quark flavours. In particular, production of vector mesons is sensitive only to GPDs H f and E f .

However, the GPDs E f are of special interest, as they are related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks. They describe transitions with nucleon helicity flip, in which orbital angular momentum must be involved due to total angular momentum conservation. It was pointed out that the spin dependent cross sections for DVCS on transversely polarised protons [13,14] and for exclusive vector meson production by longitudinal photons on transversely polarised nucleons [15] are sensitive to the 'elusive' nucleon helicity-flip GPDs E f .

A mixture of liquid 3 He and 4 He, used to refrigerate the target, and a small admixture of other nuclei are also present in the target. It consists of either three (NH 3 ) or two ( 6 LiD) separate cells with polarisable material, placed one after another along the beam. The spin directions in neighbouring cells are opposite. Both target configurations allow for a simultaneous measurement of azimuthal asymmetries for the two target spin directions to compensate flux-dependent systematic uncertainties. In order to reduce systematic effects of the acceptance, the spin directions are reversed periodically about every week with polarisation measurements before and after reversal. The three-cell configuration results in a more balanced acceptance for cells with opposite polarisation, which leads to a further reduction of systematic effects.

The high-M X tail of diffractive dissociation events can be seen in Fig. 6 next to the exclusive peak as a small enhancement over the SIDIS background. Diffractive dissociation background is examined using a MC event generator called HEPGEN [26]. This generator is dedicated to studies of hard exclusive single photon or meson production processes in the COMPASS kinematic domain. In addition, it allows also to generate single photon or meson production accompanied by diffractive dissociation of the nucleon. Using both exclusive and nucleon-dissociative \u03c1 0 events generated by HEPGEN, which are reconstructed and selected as the real data, the contribution from low-mass diffractive dissociation of the nucleon is found to be \u2248 14 % of the incoherent exclusive \u03c1 0 signal. No attempt is made to remove this type of background, motivated by HERA results on \u03c1 0 production where for unpolarised protons the angular distributions of proton-dissociative events were found consistent with those of exclusive events [27][28][29].

The modification of the \u03c1 0 relativistic Breit-Wigner shape in the presence of nonresonant \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events, which is observed for the distribution, is taken into account by applying either the S\u00f6ding [30] or the Ross-Stodolsky [31] approach.

[32]. The ratios of this cross section per nucleon for a given nucleus to the cross section on the proton or deuteron are parameterised [33] over a wide Q 2 -range, using measurements on various nuclear targets. No dependence of nuclear effects on y or \u03bd is assumed, motivated by NMC results on exclusive \u03c1 0 production [34] in a kinematic range similar to that of COMPASS. The Q 2 dependence of the dilution factor for incoherent exclusive \u03c1 0 production is shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen, the values of the dilution factor f for the NH 3 target vary from 0.27 at Q 2 = 1 (GeV/c) 2 to 0.18 at Q 2 = 10 (GeV/c) 2 , and correspondingly from 0.45 to 0.42 for the 6 LiD target 1 . Radiative corrections are neglected in the present analysis, in particular in the calculation of f . They are expected to be small, mainly because of the exclusivity cuts (see Sec. 4) that largely suppress the otherwise dominant external photon radiation [35].

At present none of the existing generators satisfactorily describes the SIDIS background. The bin-by-bin comparison of the background non-corrected results for each target indicates good agreement between both estimators. However, for each of the three binnings used, in x Bj , Q 2 and p 2 T , the mean asymmetry values for the deuteron from the binned method is observed to be slightly smaller than that from the unbinned method, by several percent of the statistical uncertainty. Additionally, systematic differences of similar size are seen in the deuteron data between the mean values of the asymmetries evaluated in the three binnings. Both these effects result in a systematic uncertainty of \u2248 0.10 \u03c3 stat . As systematic uncertainties (a)-(f) are evaluated using data, here and in the following a systematic uncertainty is expressed in terms of \u03c3 stat , which is the statistical error of the background corrected asymmetry measured in a given kinematic bin. For the proton data one observes good agreement between different estimators also at the level of mean asymmetries. The distribution of differences between mean asymmetries obtained from two estimators is centred at zero and its RMS value is used to estimate a systematic uncertainty of \u2248 0.12 \u03c3 stat .

In order to increase the statistical significance, the false asymmetries are studied in an extended range, \u221210 GeV< E miss < 20 GeV. The resulting false asymmetries are found to be consistent with zero within statistical uncertainties. They are used to estimate upper bounds for the corresponding systematic uncertainty, namely 0.15 \u03c3 stat (0.49 \u03c3 stat ) for the proton (deuteron) data.",

The rescaled spectra are subtracted from the corresponding \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 S distributions for the data and the asymmetries are extracted from the resulting background-corrected distributions as described in Sec. 6.

Despite the different shapes of E miss distributions in the two cases, differences between background-corrected asymmetries are very small as expected, because a bad parameterisation of the background does not introduce a background asymmetry. Additionally, for the 2007 set-up a second large Monte Carlo background sample was generated using PYTHIA with default values of parameters [40]. The background shapes obtained with weighted LEPTO and weighted PYTHIA are similar but in general the latter results in about 10 % less background. In most of the kinematic bins the asymmetries are the same. The systematic uncertainty due to the Monte Carlo description of the SIDIS background is negligible for the proton data and is estimated to be about 0.04 \u03c3 stat for the deuteron data. T agrees within about 0.30 \u03c3 stat ; half of this difference is taken into account as systematic uncertainty due to background subtraction. For the deuteron data, the three mean asymmetry values are in reasonable agreement. The small differences observed are similar as in the case of the background non-corrected asymmetries and hence not introduced by background subtraction.",
