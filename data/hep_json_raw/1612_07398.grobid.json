Here K * K denotes both K * \u00b1 K \u2213 and its isospin-conjugated process K * 0 K 0 + c.c., and K * denotes the resonances K * (892), K * 2 (1430) and K * 3 (1780). The observations indicate a strong violation of the helicity selection rule in \u03c7c2 decays into vector and pseudoscalar meson pairs. The measured branching fractions of \u03c7c2 \u2192 K * (892)K are more than 10 times larger than the upper limit of \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , which is so far the first direct observation of a significant U -spin symmetry breaking effect in charmonium decays.",

In the charmonium energy region, although there are observations that pQCD plays a dominant role, there are also many hints that non-perturbative mechanisms can become important [3][4][5][6]. Exclusive decays of the P -wave charmonium state \u03c7 c2 \u2192 V P , where V and P denote light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively, are ideal for testing the HSR and pinning down the mechanisms that may violate the leading pQCD approximation.",

It was shown in Ref.

However, the U -spin symmetry breaking due to the relatively large mass difference between u/d and s quarks would lead to significant contributions from the intermediate charmed-strange D s -meson loops in the decay of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K. Therefore, a precise measurement of these decays is of great value for our understanding of the physics in the interplay between the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes, and the comparison between these two decays can provide a direct investigation into the role of the intermediate meson loops as a dominant mechanism for violating the HSR.",

The resonances K * (892) and K * 2 (1430) in the K\u03c0 system as well as the a 2 (1320) in the KK system, which have a significance larger than 8\u03c3 in both decay modes, are included in the baseline solution. For insignificant excited K * states, such as K * (1410), K * (1680), and K * 3 (1780), their contributions are tested by inclusion of their different combinations to the baseline solution. We find that the contribution from K * 3 (1780) is quite stable (the difference is less than 10%), so it is included in the baseline solution. But it becomes unstable for the other two resonances (the difference is larger than 100%). Hence, K * (1410) and K * (1680) are excluded in the baseline solution, but they are considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. The coupling constants for the charge-conjugate modes are treated to be the same. Figures 2 and 3(a)-(c) show the invariant mass distribution and the projection of the PWA for the decays \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , respectively. The signal yields for the individual processes with a given intermediate state and the corresponding statistical uncertainties are calculated according to the fit results. The resultant branching fractions for the decays \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * K and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 a 2 (1320)\u03c0 are summarized in Table I. The branching fractions for the processes including charged K * intermediate states are consistent between the two decay modes, and are combined by considering the correlation of uncertainties between the two modes [18]. The K * isospin-conjugate modes are consistent with each other within 2\u03c3, as expected by isospin symmetry. Note that the helicity amplitude ratios |F 2,0 | 2 /|F 1,0 | 2 , estimated with the fitted g LS (see Table II), suggest the dominance of F 1,0 in the transition amplitudes. The amplitude F 1,0 contributes to the leading HSR violation effects and scales as (\u039b QCD /m c ) 6 due to its asymptotic behavior [2,7], where \u039b QCD \u223c 0.2 GeV/c 2 and the charm quark mass m c \u223c 1.5 GeV/c 2 . In comparison with the HSR conserved channel \u03c7 c2 \u2192 V V , which scales as (\u039b QCD /m c ) 4 , the ratio of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430)K to V V is expected to be suppressed by a factor of (\u039b QCD /m c ) 2 \u223c 0.02, However, the measured branching fraction of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430)K appears to be the same or- Mode",

            "text": "In summary, the HSR suppressed processes of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430)K, \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 are studied with the \u03c8(3686) data collected by BE-SIII for the first time. The branching fractions of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892) \u00b1 K \u2213 , \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892) 0 K 0 + c.c., \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430) \u00b1 K \u2213 and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430) 0 K 0 + c.c. are measured to be (1.5\u00b10.1\u00b10.2)\u00d710 \u22124 , (1.3\u00b10.2\u00b10.2)\u00d710 \u22124 , (15.5\u00b10.6\u00b11.2)\u00d710 \u22124 and (13.0\u00b11.0\u00b11.5)\u00d710 \u22124 respectively. As estimated above, the branching fraction for the amplitude F 1,0 dominant process is excepted to be suppressed by a factor of 0.02 to those of the HSR conserving decay \u03c7 c2 \u2192 V V [17,19]. However, there are rather sizeable for our measurement. The large branching fractions of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * 2 (1430)K and \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K are a direct indication of the significant HSR violation effects. These branching fractions of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K are at least one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit of the branching fraction of \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 (1.1\u00d710 \u22125 ). It is worth noting that this phenomenon is anticipated by the HSR violation mechanism proposed in Ref. [7]. Namely, the HSR violation in \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K occurs via the intermediate meson loops due to the large U -spin symmetry breaking, while that in \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is due to isospin symmetry breaking. Due to the large mass difference between s and u/d quarks, the U -spin symmetry is broken more severely in comparison with isospin symmetry. This results in the larger decay branching for \u03c7 c2 \u2192 K * (892)K than that for \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03c1(770) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 . The results are crucial for further quantifying the HSR violation mechanisms [7] and also provide deeper insights into the underlying strong interaction dynamics in the charmonium energy region.",
