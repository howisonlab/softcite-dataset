The large charm production cross section at HERA makes it possible to also investigate the excited charm-meson states. In a previous ZEUS analysis [1], with an integrated luminosity of 126 pb \u22121 , the orbitally excited states D 1 (2420) 0 with J P = 1 + and D * 2 (2460) 0 with J P = 2 + were studied in the decay modes 61 D 1 (2420) 0 \u2192 D * (2010) + \u03c0 \u2212 and D * 2 (2460) 0 \u2192 D * (2010) + \u03c0 \u2212 , D + \u03c0 \u2212 . The width of the D 0 1 was found to be significantly above the 2008 world-average value [2]. A study of the helicity angular distribution of the D 1 (2420) 0 gave results that were consistent with some S-wave admixture in the decay D 0 1 \u2192 D * + \u03c0 \u2212 , contrary to Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) predictions [3,4] and to previous experimental results [5] which had yielded a pure D-wave decay in this channel.",

For both the neutral and charged excited charm mesons the study also includes a measurement of fragmentation fractions and ratios of the D * 2 branching fractions. The analysis was performed using data taken from 2003 to 2007, when HERA collided electrons or positrons at 27.5 GeV with protons at 920 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 373 pb \u22121 . The upgraded ZEUS detector included a microvertex detector, allowing the measurement of the decay vertex of charm mesons. In particular, the signal-to-background ratio was significantly improved for the D + meson, which has the highest lifetime among the charm hadrons.",

The mass distribution was fitted to a sum of a modified Gaussian function, a broad modified Gaussian representing the reflection produced by D 0 mesons with the wrong (opposite) kaon and pion mass assignment and a polynomial background. For the reflection, the shape parameters of the broad modified Gaussian were obtained from a study of the MC signal sample and the normalisation (integral) was set equal to that of the other modified Gaussian. The fit yielded 63 a D 0 signal of 145740 \u00b1 2944 events and a D 0 mass of 1864.1 \u00b1 0.1 MeV which is 0.8 MeV lower than the PDG average value[16]. This deviation does not affect any of the results of the excited charm mesons. Only D 0 candidates with 1.845 < M(K\u03c0\u03c0) < 1.885 GeV were used for the excited charm mesons analysis.",

Signals of D 1 (2420) 0 and D * 2 (2460) 0 were seen in the D * + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode and a clear D * 2 (2460) 0 signal was seen in the D + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode. The measured D 0 1 and D * 0 2 masses and widths are in good agreement with the latest PDG values. The measured D 0 1 helicity parameter allows for some S-wave mixing in its decay to D * + \u03c0 \u2212 . The result is also consistent with a pure D-wave hypothesis. The helicity of D * 0 2 , when set free in the fit, is consistent with the HQET prediction, h = \u22121. 2 , D * is a positively charged (neutral) D * , \u03c0 is a negatively (positively) charged pion and D is a positively charged (neutral) D (charge conjugation is implied). In this system D 1,2 and \u03c0 in the initial decay and D and \u03c0 0 in the subsequent decay are produced with back-to-back momenta. The momenta of particles in this system are:",
