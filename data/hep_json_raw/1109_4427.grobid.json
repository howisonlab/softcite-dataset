No evidence of such a resonance is observed, and upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio of the resonant state as a function of Higgs boson mass. The limits are interpreted in the context of the standard model and one fermiophobic benchmark model where the data exclude fermiophobic Higgs bosons with masses below 114 GeV/c 2 at a 95% Bayesian credibility level.",

Sorin, 4  In the standard model (SM) of particle physics, the electromagnetic and weak forces are unified into a single theory known as electroweak theory. However, the measured cross sections for electromagnetic and weak interactions differ by several orders of magnitude due to massive W and Z bosons that mediate the weak interactions. These bosons gain mass via electroweak symmetry breaking by way of the Higgs mechanism [1], and the electroweak theory predicts the existence of a boson, known as the Higgs boson, that provides a direct test of the theory.",

Even so, a search using the diphoton final state is appealing due to its better mass resolution and reconstruction efficiency relative to dominant decay modes involving b quarks. The H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel provides its greatest sensitivity for Higgs boson masses between 110 and 140 GeV/c 2 , contributing in a region most useful to combined Tevatron Higgs boson searches [3] and overlapping with a region preferred by electroweak constraints [4].

The locations of the vertex and EM energy cluster are used to derive the photon's momentum.

We use a flat prior in \u03c3 \u00d7 B(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) and integrate over the priors for the systematic uncertainties.

The observed 95% C.L. on \u03c3 \u00d7 B(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) are calculated from the data. The limit results are displayed in Table II and graphically in Fig. 2.
