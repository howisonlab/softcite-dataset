            "text": "The mass of the top quark is measured using a sample of tt events collected by the CMS detector using proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. Events are selected with one isolated muon or electron and at least four jets from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . For each event the mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a tt hypothesis. Using the ideogram method, the top quark mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in qq decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to a leadingorder parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be 172.25 \u00b1 0.08 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.62 (syst) GeV. The dependence of this result on the kinematic properties of the event is studied and compared to predictions of different models of tt production, and no indications of a bias in the measurements are observed.",

Top quark loops provide the dominant contribution to radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass, and accurate measurements of both the top quark mass (m t ) and the Higgs boson mass allow consistency tests of the SM [1]. In addition, the decision whether the SM vacuum is stable or meta-stable needs a precise measurement of m t as the Higgs boson quartic coupling at the Planck scale depends heavily on m t [2].",

At this higher center-ofmass energy, new data and simulated samples are available for this analysis. The method closely follows the strategy of the most precise CMS Run 1 measurement [6]. While the selected final state, the kinematic reconstruction, and mass extraction technique have not changed, the new simulations describe the data better and allow a more refined estimation of the modeling uncertainties. In contrast to the Run 1 analysis, the renormalization and factorization scales in the matrixelement (ME) calculation and the scales in the initial-and final-state parton showers (PS) are now varied separately for the evaluation of systematic effects. In addition, we evaluate the impact of different models of color reconnection that were not available for the Run 1 measurements.",

Hence, the minimal final state consists of a muon or electron, at least four jets, and one undetected neutrino. This includes events where a muon or electron from a \u03c4 lepton decay passes the selection criteria. The analysis employs a kinematic fit of the decay products to a tt hypothesis and twodimensional likelihood functions for each event to estimate simultaneously the top quark mass and a scale factor (JSF) to be applied to the momenta of all jets. The invariant mass of the two jets associated with the W \u2192 qq decay serves as an observable in the likelihood functions to estimate the JSF directly, exploiting the precise knowledge of the W boson mass from previous measurements [3]. The analysis is performed on the data sample collected in 2016 and includes studies of the dependence of the measured mass value on the kinematic properties of the events.",

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) [19]. All jets are corrected by jet energy correc-tions (JECs) based on simulations. Residual JECs which are derived from the energy balance in \u03b3 /Z boson + jet, dijet, and multijet events [20] are applied to the jets in data. The JECs are also propagated to improve the measurement of p miss T . The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex.

Finally, diboson (WW, WZ, and ZZ) and multijet events from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes are generated with pythia 8 for ME generation, PS simulation, and hadronization. These background samples use the pythia 8 tune CUETP8M1. The parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 NLO derived with the strong coupling strength \u03b1 S = 0.118 [35] and its corresponding LO version are used as the default parametrization of the PDFs in all simulations, respectively. The samples are normalized to the theoretical predictions described in Refs. [27,[36][37][38][39]. All events are further processed by a full simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4 [40]. The simulation includes effects of pileup with the same multiplicity distribution as in data. The response and the resolution of simulated jets is corrected to match the data [20].",

Therefore, the difference in jet energy response between pythia 6 and herwig++ is determined for each jet flavor [20]. In order to evaluate possible differences between the measured JSF (from light quarks with gluon contamination) and the b jet energy scale, the flavor uncertainties for jets from light quarks, gluons, and bottom quarks are evaluated separately and added linearly. b jet modeling: This term has three components: The fragmentation into b hadrons is varied in simulation within the uncertainties of the Bowler-Lund fragmentation function tuned to ALEPH [58] and DELPHI [59] data. In addition, the difference between the Bowler-Lund [60] and the Peter-son [61] fragmentation functions is included in the uncertainty. Lastly, the uncertainty from the semileptonic b hadron branching fraction is obtained by varying it by \u2212 0.45% and + 0.77%, which is the range of the measurements from B 0 /B + decays and their uncertainties [3].",

The inclusion of the JSF as a nuisance parameter in the fit and its constraint by the m reco W observable reduces not only the uncertainties stemming from the JECs, but also the modeling uncertainties.

The other remaining systematic uncertainties are also dominated by effects that cannot be fully compensated through the simultaneous deter- Table 3 List of systematic uncertainties for the fits to the combined data set using the procedures described in Sect. 5.

For the hybrid analysis, a hybrid weight of w hyb = 0.3 is found optimal based on the total uncertainty in the 2D result of the JSF and the jet energy scale uncertainty in the JECs. Due to the larger jet energy uncertainties at the beginning of the 13 TeV data taking, w hyb is lower than in the Run 1 analysis [6] where the prior JSF knowledge contributes 50% of the information. With an expected statistical uncertainty \u03b4JSF 2D stat = 0.08% on the JSF for the 2D analysis, the width of the prior is \u03c3 prior = 0.12%. The hybrid analysis leads to further reduced uncertainties in the FSR PS scale and in ERDs compared to the 2D analysis. This stems from the opposite signs of the observed shifts in m t for the 1D and 2D analyses, i.e., the JSF from the 2D analysis overcompensates the effects on m fit t .",

The measured unconstrained JSF is compatible with the one obtained from jets recoiling against photons and Z bosons within its uncertainties. The hybrid fit measurement of m t = 172.25 \u00b1 0.08 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.62 (syst) GeV offers the lowest overall uncertainty and, therefore, is chosen as the main result of this study. This is the first published result of the top quark mass measured with Run 2 data and the new NLO generator setups. Because of the larger integrated luminosity and the higher tt cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV, the statistical uncertainty is halved compared to the Run 1 result of m t = 172.35 \u00b1 0.16 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.48 (syst) GeV [6]. This measurement is consistent with the Run 1 result within the uncertainties. The previous measurement was calibrated with tt events generated at LO with MadGraph 5.1.5.11 [71] matched to pythia 6.426 PS [56] with the Z2 * tune [72] using the MLM prescription. No shift in the measured top quark mass from the new simulation at NLO with powheg v2 and pythia 8 and the new experimental setup is observed. The systematic uncertainties are larger than for the Run 1 result due to a more advanced treatment of the modeling uncertainties. This is mainly caused by the evaluation of a broader set of color-reconnection models that were not available in Run 1, yielding a more extensive treatment of the associated uncertainty. Without the uncertainty due to these models of 0.31 GeV, the systematic uncertainties in m t would be reduced from 0.62 to 0.54 GeV and would be much closer to the Run 1 result. Tighter constraints on the existing colorreconnection models and the settings in the NLO simulations can occur in the near future and reduce the systematic uncertainties due to these specific models. The new treatment of the modeling uncertainties will require special care when combining this measurement with the Run 1 result.",
