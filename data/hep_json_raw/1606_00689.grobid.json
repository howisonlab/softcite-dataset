This paper presents a measurement of the complete set of angular coefficients A 0\u22127 describing these distributions in the Z-boson Collins-Soper frame. The data analysed correspond to 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. The measurements are compared to the most precise fixed-order calculations currently available (O(\u03b1 2 s )) and with theoretical predictions embedded in Monte Carlo generators. The measurements are precise enough to probe QCD corrections beyond the formal accuracy of these calculations and to provide discrimination between different parton-shower models. A significant deviation from the O(\u03b1 2 s ) predictions is observed for A 0 \u2212 A 2 . Evidence is found for non-zero A 5,6,7 , consistent with expectations.",

In the Z-boson rest frame, a plane spanned by the directions of the incoming protons can be defined, e.g. using the Collins-Soper (CS) reference frame [1]. The lepton polar and azimuthal angular variables, denoted by cos \u03b8 and \u03c6 in the following formalism, are defined in this reference frame. The spin correlations are described by a set of nine helicity density matrix elements, which can be calculated within the context of the parton model using perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The theoretical formalism is elaborated in refs. [2][3][4][5].",

Therefore, all hadronic dynamics from the production mechanism are described implicitly within the structure of the A i coefficients, and are factorised from the decay kinematics in the Z-boson rest frame. This allows the measurement JHEP08(2016)159 precision to be essentially insensitive to all uncertainties in QCD, quantum electrodynamics (QED), and electroweak (EW) effects related to Z-boson production and decay. In particular, EW corrections that couple the initial-state quarks to the final-state leptons have a negligible impact (below 0.05%) at the Z-boson pole. This has been shown for the LEP precision measurements [6,7], when calculating the interference between initial-state and final-state QED radiation.",

The Lam-Tung relation [8][9][10], which predicts that A 0 \u2212A 2 = 0 due to the spin-1 of the gluon in the qg \u2192 Zq and qq \u2192 Zg diagrams, is expected to hold up to O(\u03b1 s ), but can be violated at higher orders. The coefficients A 5,6,7 are expected to become non-zero, while remaining small, only at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD (O(\u03b1 2 s )), because they arise from gluon loops that are included in the calculations [11,12].

The measurement is performed in the Z-boson invariant mass window of 80-100 GeV, as a function of p Z T , and also in three bins of y Z . These results are based on 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment [24] at the LHC. With the measurement techniques developed for this analysis, the complete set of coefficients is extracted with fine granularity over 23 bins of p Z T up to 600 GeV. The measurements, performed in the CS reference frame [1], are first presented as a function of p Z T , integrating over y Z . Further measurements divided into three bins of y Z are also presented: 0 < |y Z | < 1, 1 < |y Z | < 2, and 2 < |y Z | < 3.5. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channels where both leptons fall within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4 (hereafter referred to as the central-central or ee CC and \u00b5\u00b5 CC channels) are used for the y Z -integrated measurement and the first two y Z bins. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 channel where one of the electrons instead falls in the region |\u03b7| > 2.5 (referred to hereafter as the central-forward or ee CF channel) is used to extend the measurement to the high-y Z region encompassed by the third y Z bin. In this case, however, because of the fewer events available for the measurement itself and to evaluate the backgrounds (see section 4), the measurement is only performed for p Z T up to 100 GeV using projections of cos \u03b8 and \u03c6, making A 1 and A 6 inaccessible in the 2 < |y Z | < 3.5 bin.",

The A 0 and A 2 coefficients increase as a function of p Z T and the deviations from lowest-order expectations are quite large, even at modest values of p Z T = 20-50 GeV. The A 1 and A 3 coefficients are relatively small even at large p Z T , with a maximum value of 0.08. In the limit where p Z T = 0, all coefficients except A 4 are expected to vanish at NLO. The NNLO corrections are typically small for all coefficients except A 2 , for which the largest correction has a value of \u22120.08, in agreement with the original theoretical studies [2]. The theoretical predictions for A 5,6,7 are not shown because these coefficients are expected to be very small at all values of p Z T : they are zero at NLO and the NNLO contribution is large enough to be observable, namely of the order of 0.005 for values of p Z T in the range 20-200 GeV. The statistical uncertainties of the calculations, as well as the factorisation and renormalisation scale and PDF uncertainties, were all considered as sources of theoretical uncertainties. The statistical uncertainties of the NLO and NNLO predictions in absolute units are typically 0.0003 and 0.003, respectively. The larger statistical uncertainties of the NNLO predictions are due to the longer computational time required than for the NLO predictions. The scale uncertainties were estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales simultaneously up and down by a factor of two. As stated in ref. [2], the theoretical uncertainties due to the choice of these scales are very small for the angular coefficients because they are ratios of cross-sections.

The statistical uncertainties of the NNLO predictions are dominant and an order of magnitude larger than those of the NLO predictions.",

The inner tracker provides precision tracking of charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. This region is matched to a high-granularity EM sampling calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 3.2 and a coarser granularity calorimeter up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. A hadronic calorimeter system covers the entire pseudorapidity range up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer provides triggering and tracking capabilities in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 and |\u03b7| < 2.7, respectively. A first-level trigger is implemented in hardware, followed by two software-based trigger levels that together reduce the accepted event rate to 400 Hz on average. For this paper, a central lepton is one found in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4 (excluding, for electrons, the electromagnetic calorimeter barrel/end-cap transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52), while a forward electron is one found in the region 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9 (excluding the transition region 3.16 < |\u03b7| < 3.35 between the electromagnetic end-cap and forward calorimeters).",

The other background source arises from events in which at least one of the lepton candidates is not a prompt isolated lepton but rather a lepton from heavy-flavour hadron decay (beauty or charm) or a fake lepton in the case of electron candidates (these may arise from charged hadrons or from photon conversions within a hadronic jet).

For the central-central channels, the background determination is carried out in the full two-dimensional space of (cos \u03b8 CS , \u03c6 CS ) and in each bin of p T . In the case of the central-forward channel, the multijet background, which is by far the dominant one, is estimated separately for each projection in cos \u03b8 CS and \u03c6 CS because of the limited amount of data. This is the main reason why the angular coefficients in the central-forward channel are extracted only in projections, as described in section 1.   above. The total background in the central-central events is below 0.5% and its uncertainty is dominated by the large uncertainty in the multijet background of approximately 50%. The uncertainty in the top+electroweak background is taken conservatively to be 20%. In the case of the central-forward electron pairs, the top+electroweak background is so small compared to the much larger multijet background that it is neglected for simplicity in the fit procedure described in section 5. Table 3 summarises the observed yields of events in data for each channel, integrated over all values of p T , together with the expected background yields with their total uncertainties from multijet events and from top+electroweak sources. More details of the treatment of the background uncertainties are discussed in section 6. There are also signal events that are considered as background to the measurement because they are present in the data only due to the finite resolution of the measurements, which leads to migrations in mass and rapidity. These are denoted \"Non-fiducial Z\" events and can be divided into four categories: the dominant fraction consists of events that have m Z at the generator level outside the chosen m mass window but pass event selection, while another contribution arises from events that do not belong to the y Z bin considered for the measurement at generator level. The latter contribution is sizeable only in the ee CF channel. Other negligible sources of this type of background arise from events for which the central electron has the wrong assigned charge in the ee CF channel or both central electrons have the wrong assigned charge in the ee CC channel, or for which p Z T at the generator level is larger than 600 GeV. These backgrounds are all included as a small component of the signal MC sample in figure 4. Their contributions amount to one percent or less for the ee CC and \u00b5\u00b5 CC channels, increasing to almost 8% for the ee CF channel because of the much larger migrations in energy measurements in the case of forward electrons. For the 2 < |y Z | < 3.5 bin in the ee CF channel, the y Z migration contributes 2% to the non-fiducial Z background. The fractional contribution of all backgrounds to the total sample is shown explicitly for each channel as a function of p T in figure 5 together with the respective contributions of the multijet and top+electroweak backgrounds. The sum of all these backgrounds is also shown and templates of their angular distributions are used in the fit to extract the angular coefficients, as described in section 5.  Figure 5. Fractional background contributions as a function of p T , for the ee CC (top), \u00b5\u00b5 CC (middle) and ee CF (bottom) channels. The distributions are shown separately for the relevant background contributions to each channel together with the summed total background fraction. The label \"Non-fiducial Z\" refers to signal events which are generated outside the phase space used to extract the angular coefficients (see text).",

Effectively, all information about the Z-boson polarisation is removed from the MC sample, so that further weighting the events by any of the P i terms yields the shape of the polynomial itself, and if selection requirements are applied, this yields the shape of the selection efficiency. The selection requirements, corrections, and event weights mentioned in section 4 are then applied. Nine separate template histograms for each p Z T and y Z bin j at generator level are finally obtained after weighting by each of the P i terms. The templates t ij are thus three-dimensional distributions in the measured cos \u03b8 CS , \u03c6 CS , and p T variables, and are constructed for each p Z T and y Z bin. Eight bins in cos \u03b8 CS and \u03c6 CS are used, while the binning for the reconstructed p T is the same as for the 23 bins defined in eq. (2.3). By construction, the sum of all signal templates normalised by their reference coefficients and unpolarised cross-sections agrees exactly with the three-dimensional reconstructed distribution expected for signal MC events. Examples of templates projected onto each of the dimensions cos \u03b8 CS and \u03c6 CS for the y Z -integrated ee CC channel in three illustrative p Z T ranges, along with their corresponding polynomial shapes, are shown in figure 7.

Lepton calibration (electron energy scale and resolution as well as muon momentum scale and resolution) [52,53] and their associated uncertainties are derived from data-driven methods and applied to the simulation. Whereas the charge misidentification rate for muons is negligible, the probability for the electron charge to be misidentified can be significant for central electrons at high |\u03b7|, due to bremsstrahlung in the inner detector and the subsequent conversion of the photon. This uncertainty is a potential issue in particular for the ee CF channel, where the measured charge of the central electron sets the charge of the forward electron (where no charge determination is possible). Measurements of the per-electron charge misidentification rate using same-charge electron pairs have been done in data and compared to that in simulation; the systematic uncertainty coming from this correction has a negligible impact on the measurement.",

First, the shape of the p T spectrum in simulation is reweighted with a polynomial function so that it approximately reproduces the reconstructed spectrum in data. The impact of this procedure is expected to be small, since the signal is normalised to the data in fine bins of p Z T . Second, the p T shape within each p T bin is reweighted to that of the data.

Overall, the predictions and the data agree for all three y Z bins. These coefficients are the only ones that display any significant y Z dependence and it is interesting to note that, for high values of p Z T , the A 1 and A 3 coefficients increase as y Z increases. As explained in section 1 and detailed in appendix A, at low values of p Z T , the measured value of the A 4 coefficient can be directly related to the Weinberg angle sin 2 \u03b8 W [62]. The strong dependence of the value of the A 4 coefficient on |y Z | is, however, mostly a consequence of the approximation made for the interacting quark direction in the CS reference frame on an event-by-event basis. The impact of this approximation decreases at higher values of |y Z |, and, as a result, the measured and expected values of the A 4 coefficient increase, as can be seen in figures 16-18. The effect of the parton-shower modelling and matching scheme on the reference angular coefficients is explored in figure 19, which shows a comparison of the measurements of A 0 , A 1 , A 2 , and A 0 \u2212 A 2 with DYNNLO at NLO and NNLO, PowhegBox (without parton shower), and with the same process in PowhegBox with the parton shower simulated with Pythia 8 (PowhegBox + Pythia 8) and Herwig (PowhegBox + Herwig). The predictions from DYNNLO at NLO and PowhegBox without parton shower, which are formally at the same level of accuracy, agree for A 1 and A 2 . For the A 2 coefficient, which is the most sensitive one to higher-order corrections, adding the parton-shower simulation to the PowhegBox Z-boson production process brings the predictions closer to DYNNLO at NNLO. This is consistent with the assumption that the parton-shower model emulates higher-order effects, although the discrepancy between the measurements and the parton-shower models is larger than that with DYNNLO at NNLO. The A 0 coefficient has an unexpected offset of \u22120.025 at low values of p Z T in the PowhegBox implementation. This effect is also reflected in the predictions for A 0 \u2212 A 2 and has been corrected in the more recent version of PowhegBox (v2.1) used in this paper for the Z + jet predictions with Powheg + MiNLO [14][15][16][17]. The predictions from DYNNLO at NLO and NNLO agree well with the data measurements for the A 0 coefficient, but overestimate the rise of the A 2 coefficient at higher values of p Z T , as discussed above. Finally, it is interesting to note that, whereas the agreement between Pythia 8 and Herwig is good for most of the coefficients, the A 1 coefficient displays significant differences between the two predictions over most of the p Z T range. Although this might be ascribed to differences between the parton-shower model and matching schemes at intermediate values of p Z T , it is somewhat surprising to observe large differences for the highest values of p Z T .",

The effect of simulating Sherpa 2.1 events (up to two jets at NLO and up to five jets at LO for higher jet multiplicities) is explicitly shown. None of the configurations correctly predict the behaviour of A 0 or A 2 . The Sherpa 2.1 version follows the data more closely than the Sherpa 1.4 version. In addition, in all versions except Sherpa 2.1 with two jets, significant higher-order polynomial behaviour was found to be present.

As can be seen, the regularisation uncertainty increases with increasing regularisation strength, while the corresponding statistical uncertainty decreases, as expected. In the limit that the regularisation strength goes to zero, the statistical uncertainty approaches the unregularised one. Along with the decrease in statistical uncertainty comes an increase in correlation among the measured coefficients of neighbouring p Z T bins. The regularisation bias uncertainty appears to plateau between \u03b3 = 10 and \u03b3 = 100, which corresponds to the limit that the spectrum is fixed to a sixth-order polynomial, as described  Figure 26.
