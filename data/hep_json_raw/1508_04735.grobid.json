Events with two electrons (muons) and two or more jets in the final state are used to search for first (second)-generation leptoquarks. The results from two previously published ATLAS analyses are interpreted in terms of third-generation leptoquarks decaying to b\u03bd \u03c4b\u03bd\u03c4 and t\u03bd \u03c4t\u03bd\u03c4 final states. No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in any channel and scalar leptoquarks are excluded at 95 % CL with masses up to m LQ1 < 1050 GeV for first-generation leptoquarks, m LQ2 < 1000 GeV for second-generation leptoquarks, m LQ3 < 625 GeV for third-generation leptoquarks in the b\u03bd \u03c4b\u03bd\u03c4 channel, and 200 < m LQ3 < 640 GeV in the t\u03bd \u03c4t\u03bd\u03c4 channel.",

They can be either scalar or vector bosons and are expected to decay directly to lepton-quark pairs (where the lepton can be either charged or neutral).",

The production cross-section and couplings of vector LQs are enhanced relative to the contribution of scalar LQs, although the acceptance is expected to be similar in both cases.

In addition, limits are placed on pair-produced third-generation scalar LQs (LQ3) by reinterpreting ATLAS searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) in two different channels [18,19]. LQ production and decay mechanisms can be similar to those of stop quarks (t) and sbottom quarks (b).

The coupling \u03bb LQ\u2192 q which determines the LQ lifetime and width [23] is set to \u221a 0.01 \u00d7 4\u03c0\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the finestructure constant. This value gives the LQ a full width of less than 100 MeV, which is much smaller than the detector resolution. For LQ masses in the ranges considered here (200 GeV \u2264 m LQ \u2264 1300 GeV, in steps of 50 GeV), the value of the coupling used is such that the LQs can be considered to decay promptly. The production cross-section of pairproduced LQs is assumed to be independent of the coupling strength. The signal process is normalised to the expected next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross-sections for scalar LQ pair-production [24]. The signal production cross-section is 23.5 fb for a LQ mass of 600 GeV, and 0.40 fb for a 1 TeV LQ and is the same for each generation.",

The identification efficiency is on average 85 % [50]. Electron candidates must have transverse energy E T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47. Electron candidates associated with clusters in the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52) are excluded. All electrons are required to be reconstructed with cluster-based or combined cluster-and track-based algorithms and to satisfy calorimeter quality criteria. Requirements are made on the transverse (|d 0 |) and longitudinal (|z 0 |) impact parameters of the electron relative to the primary vertex and must satisfy |d 0 | < 1 mm and |z 0 | < 5 mm. In addition, electrons are required to be isolated by imposing requirements on the E R<0.2 T measured in the calorimeter within a cone of size R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.2 around the electron cluster excluding the electron cluster energy, and corrected to account for leakage (i.e. energy deposited by the electron outside of the cluster) and the average number of proton-proton interactions per bunch-crossing. The isolation requirements are optimised for highp T electrons following the strategy in Ref. [48]. The leading electron is required to have E R<0.2 T < 0.007 \u00d7 E T + 5 GeV, and the sub-leading electron is required to have E R<0.2 T < 0.022 \u00d7 E T +6 GeV. Muon tracks are reconstructed independently in the ID and the MS. Tracks are required to have a minimum number of hits in each system, and must be compatible in terms of geometrical and momentum matching. In particular, in order to prevent mis-measurements at high p T , muons are required to have hits in all three MS stations, as described in Ref. [48]. In order to increase the muon identification efficiency, when one muon in the event satisfies the three-stations requirement, the criteria for the second muon in the event are relaxed to require hits in only two MS stations. Information from both the ID and MS is used in a combined fit to refine the measure-ment of the momentum of each muon [51]. Muon candidates are required to have p T > 40 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, |d 0 | < 0.2 mm and |z 0 | < 1.0 mm. Muons must also pass a relative-isolation requirement",

These control regions define a pure sample of Z /\u03b3 * +jets events. The tt control region is defined in both channels by applying the preselection requirements, but demanding exactly one muon and one electron (both with p T above 40 GeV) in the offline selection instead of two same-flavour leptons. In the case of the tt control region for the eejj channel, the trigger requirement is modified by requiring a single isolated electron with p T above 24 GeV, which is fully efficient relative to the offline selection for electrons with p T above 30 GeV. In both cases, the same selection criteria are applied to data and MC events. Normalisation factors are applied to the MC predictions for the Z /\u03b3 * +jets and tt background processes. They are obtained by performing a combined maximum likelihood fit to the observed yields in the control regions and signal region under consideration. Systematic uncertainties on the predicted MC yields related to the uncertainty on the crosssections are taken into account by the fit through the use of dedicated nuisance parameters. The fit procedure is performed using the HistFitter package [57], which is a tool based on the RooStats framework [58].
