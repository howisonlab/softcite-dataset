The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb \u22121 , which was recorded in 2011 at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No evidence for a resonance is found and limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio to tt for narrow and wide resonances. For narrow Z bosons, the observed 95 % Bayesian credibility level limits range from 9.3 pb to 0.95 pb for masses in the range of m Z = 500 GeV to m Z = 1300 GeV. The corresponding excluded mass region for a leptophobic topcolour Z boson (Kaluza-Klein gluon excitation in the Randall-Sundrum model) is m Z < 880 GeV (m g KK < 1130 GeV).",

Since particle masses are central to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry, final states that involve the heaviest of the particles presumed to be elementary, the top quark, offer particular promise in searches for new physics. This Article describes searches for new heavy particles decaying to top quark pairs (tt) using the ATLAS detector [1] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Multiple final state topologies containing at least one lepton (electron or muon) are considered, in which the lepton is expected to originate from the decay of one of the W bosons produced in the top quark decays. In events with one lepton-the lepton plus jets ( + jets) channel-the reconstructed tt mass spectrum is used to search for a signal. In events with two leptons-the dilepton channel-the effective mass is used. Both variables are defined in Sect. 8. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch",

            "text": "The benchmark model used to quantify the experimental sensitivity to narrow resonances is a topcolour Z boson [2] arising in models of strong electroweak symmetry breaking through top quark condensation [3]. The specific model used is the leptophobic scenario, model IV in Ref. [2] with f 1 = 1 and f 2 = 0 and a width of 1.2 % of the Z boson mass. The model used for wide resonances is a Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluon g KK , which appears in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models in which particles are located in a warped dimension [4][5][6][7]. The left-handed (g L ) and right-handed (g R ) couplings to quarks take the conventional RS values [5]: g L = g R = \u22120.2g s for light quarks including charm, where g s = \u221a 4\u03c0\u03b1 s ; g L = 1.0g s , g R = \u22120.2g s for bottom quarks; and g L = 1.0g s , g R = 4.0g s for the top quark. In this case, the resonance width is 15.3 % of its mass, larger than the detector resolution.",

The Inner Detector (ID) covers pseudorapidities 1 of |\u03b7| < 2.5 and consists of layers of silicon pixel and strip detectors and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker. It is embedded in the bore of a 2 T superconducting solenoidal magnet to allow precise measurement of charged particle momenta. This system is surrounded by a hermetic calorimeter system consisting of finely segmented sampling calorimeters using lead/liquid-argon for the detection of electromagnetic (EM) showers up to |\u03b7| < 3.2, and copper or tungsten/liquid-argon for hadronic showers for 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. In the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7), an iron/scintillator hadronic calorimeter is used. Outside the calorimeters, the muon spectrometer incorporates multiple layers of trigger and tracking chambers within an air-core toroidal magnetic field, enabling an independent, precise measurement of muon track momenta.",

The leading jet must have p T > 60 GeV, and at least one of the jets must be tagged as a b-jet. The requirement on the number of jets is relaxed when one jet has m j > 60 GeV since for top quarks with significant boost the decay products are collimated, and multiple quarks from top quark or W boson decay can be reconstructed as a single, massive jet.

For the limit setting, the + jets channel uses variable-size binning, with bins ranging in size from 40 GeV to 500 GeV bins for narrow resonances, and 80 GeV to 500 GeV for Kaluza-Klein gluons. These values are close to the mass resolution while limiting bin-by-bin statistical fluctuations. Mass values below 500 GeV, i.e. the tt threshold region, are not considered.  The posterior probability density is calculated using Bayes' theorem, with a flat positive prior in the signal crosssection which is found to be a good approximation of the reference prior [64]. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated using nuisance parameters that smear the parameters of the Poisson probability in each bin. For each systematic uncertainty a Gaussian prior controls the probability for a given deviation of the parameter from the nominal value. The 95 % credibility level (CL) upper limit on the signal cross-section times branching ratio is identified with the 95 % point of the posterior probability. The expected limits are determined by using the background expectation instead of the data in the limit computation, and the one and two standard-deviation bands around these limits are determined from the distribution of limits in pseudo-experiments. Systematic uncertainties degrade the expected crosssection limits by a factor ranging from 3.0 at low mass to 1.5 at high mass. Of the 32 systematic uncertainties considered, none contribute individually more than 15 % of the degradation.",
