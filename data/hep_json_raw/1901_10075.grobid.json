The integrated luminosities of the 13 TeV and 8 TeV datasets are 3.2 fb \u22121 and 20.2 fb \u22121 , respectively. The ratio is measured as a function of the photon transverse energy in different regions of the photon pseudorapidity. The predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations are compared with the measured ratio. The experimental systematic uncertainties as well as the uncertainties affecting the predictions are evaluated taking into account the correlations between the two centre-of-mass energies, resulting in a reduction of up to a factor of 2.5 (5) in the experimental (theoretical) systematic uncertainties. The predictions based on several parameterisations of the proton parton distribution functions agree with the data within the reduced experimental and theoretical uncertainties. In addition, this ratio to that of the fiducial cross sections for Z boson production at 13 and 8 TeV using the decay channels Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is made and compared with the theoretical predictions. In this double ratio, a further reduction of the experimental uncertainty is obtained because the uncertainties arising from the luminosity measurement cancel out. The predictions describe the measurements of the double ratio within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties.",

These measurements can also be used to tune Monte Carlo (MC) models to improve our understanding of prompt-photon production and aid those analyses for which events containing photons are an important background.",

            "text": "Measurements of prompt-photon production at a hadron collider necessitate an isolation requirement to reduce the large contribution of photons from hadron decays and the fragmentation component in which the emitted photon is close to a jet. The production of isolated photons in pp collisions has been measured previously by the ATLAS [5][6][7][8][9] and CMS [10,11] collaborations at centre-of-mass energies ( \u221a s) of 7, 8 and 13 TeV. Comparisons of measurements of prompt-photon production and pQCD predictions are usually limited by the theoretical uncertainties associated with the missing higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion. The measurements of inclusive isolated-photon cross sections performed by ATLAS at 13 TeV [9] and 8 TeV [8] were compared with the predictions of pQCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) [12,13]. At both centre-of-mass energies, the uncertainties affecting the predictions are dominated by terms beyond NLO and are larger than those of experimental nature, preventing a more precise test of the theory. An avenue to reach a more stringent test is the inclusion of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections in the calculations [14]. Another avenue is to make measurements of the ratio of cross sections for inclusive isolated-photon production at 13 and 8 TeV (R \u03b3 13/8 ) and compare them with the predictions [15,16]. The impact of the experimental systematic uncertainties and theoretical uncertainties on the ratio of the cross sections is reduced, allowing a more precise comparison between data and theory. This is achieved by accounting for inter-\u221a s correlations in the experimental systematic uncertainties affecting the measurements and in the uncertainties of the theory predictions.",

This paper presents measurements of the ratio of cross sections for isolated-photon production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The phase-space region is given by the overlap of the ATLAS measurements at \u221a s = 13 and 8 TeV, defined by the photon transverse energy 2 (E \u03b3 T ) in the range E \u03b3 T > 125 GeV and the photon pseudorapidity (\u03b7 \u03b3 ) in the region |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, excluding JHEP04(2019)093 the region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.56. The photon is isolated by requiring that the transverse energy inside a cone of size \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane around the photon direction, E iso T , is smaller than E iso T,cut \u2261 4.2 \u2022 10 \u22123 \u2022 E \u03b3 T + 4.8 GeV [8,9]. Non-isolated prompt photons are not considered as signal. The measurements of the ratios are based on the ATLAS measurements at 13 TeV [9] and 8 TeV [8] and a detailed study of the correlations of the experimental systematic uncertainties between the two centre-of-mass energies is presented here. The measurement of the ratios is presented as a function of E \u03b3 T in different regions of \u03b7 \u03b3 , namely |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 0.6, 0.6 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37, 1.56 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.81 and 1.81 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37. Next-to-leading-order pQCD predictions for the ratio are compared with the measurements. In addition, measurements of D \u03b3/Z 13/8 are presented using the ATLAS results for R Z 13/8 [17]; the measurements are compared with available theory predictions. The paper is organised as follows: the ATLAS detector is described in section 2. The analysis strategy is summarised in section 3. Fixed-order QCD predictions and their uncertainties are discussed in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the description of the experimental uncertainties. The results are reported in section 6. A summary is given in section 7.",

The inner detector is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid and includes silicon detectors, which provide precision tracking in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, and a transition-radiation tracker providing additional tracking and electron identification information for |\u03b7| < 2.0.

Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, EM calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) EM calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters; for |\u03b7| < 2.5 the LAr calorimeters are divided into three layers in depth.

Candidates without a matching track or reconstructed conversion vertex in the inner detector are classified as unconverted photons, while those with a matching reconstructed conversion vertex or a matching track consistent with originating from a photon conversion are classified as converted photons [22]. The photon identification is based primarily on shower shapes in the calorimeter [22]. It uses information from the hadronic calorimeter, the lateral shower shape in the second layer of the EM calorimeter and the shower shapes in the finely segmented first EM calorimeter layer to ensure the compatibility of the measured shower profile with that originating from a single photon impacting the calorimeter. The photon energy measurement is made using calorimeter and, when available, tracking information. An energy calibration [23] is applied to the candidates to account for upstream energy loss and both lateral and longitudinal leakage. Events with at least one photon candidate with calibrated E \u03b3 T > 125 GeV and |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37 excluding the region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.56 are selected. The isolation transverse energy E iso T is corrected for leakage of the photon energy into the isolation cone and the estimated contributions from the underlying event (UE) and additional inelastic pp interactions (pile-up). The latter two corrections are computed simultaneously on an event-by-event basis using the jet-area method [24,25]. After these corrections, isolated photons are selected by requiring E iso T to be lower than E iso T,cut . A small background contribution still remains after imposing the photon identification and isolation requirements and is subtracted using a data-driven method based on background control regions [8,9]. The selected samples of events are used to unfold the distribution in E \u03b3 T for each |\u03b7 \u03b3 | region to a phase-space region close to that used for event selection.",

These uncertainties are much larger than those of experimental nature and limit how precisely the predictions can be tested. The study of the theoretical uncertainties in the ratio is described in section 4. As is the case for the experimental systematic uncertainties, it is imperative that for each source of theoretical uncertainty the degree of correlation between the two centre-of-mass energies is taken into account.

Assuming no correlation provides a conservative estimate and full correlation is used only when justified. The estimation of the systematic uncertainties in the ratio has to take into account the changes in the data-taking conditions as well as changes in the detector conditions.

From figure 3 it is concluded that the relative uncertainty in R \u03b3 13/8 due to the photon energy scale is no longer the dominant uncertainty, except for E \u03b3 T > 300 GeV in the regions 0.6 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.37 and 1.56 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.81.",
