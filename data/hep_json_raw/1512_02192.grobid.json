Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final states are corrected for detector effects and combined. Compared to previous measurements in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, these new measurements benefit from a larger data sample and improved control of systematic uncertainties. Measurements are performed in bins of lepton-pair mass above, around and below the Z -boson mass peak. The data are compared to predictions from perturbative and resummed QCD calculations. For values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 < 1 the predictions from the Monte Carlo generator ResBos are generally consistent with the data within the theoretical uncertainties. However, at larger values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 this is not the case. Monte Carlo generators based on the parton-shower approach are unable to describe the data over the full range of p T while the fixed-order prediction of Dynnlo falls below the data at high values of p T . ResBos and the parton-shower Monte Carlo generators provide a much better description of the evolution of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 and p T distributions as a function of lepton-pair mass and rapidity than the basic shape of the data.",

The vector bosons may have non-zero momentum transverse to the beam direction p (W,Z ) T due to the emission of quarks and gluons from the initial-state partons as well as to the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial-state partons in the proton. Phenomenologically, the spectrum at low p (W,Z ) T can be described using soft-gluon resummation [1] together with a non-perturbative contribution from the parton intrinsic transverse momentum. At high p (W,Z ) T the spectrum may be described by fixed-order perturbative QCD predictions [2][3][4]. Parton-shower models [5,6] may be used to compensate for missing higher-order corrections in the fixed-order QCD predictions.",

The correct modelling of p (W,Z ) T is also important in many physics analyses at the LHC for which the production of W and/or Z bosons constitutes a background. Moreover, it is a crucial ingredient for a precise measurement of the W -boson mass, at both the LHC and the Tevatron. Measurements of the dependence of p (W,Z ) T on the boson rapidity 1 are sensitive to the gluon distribution function of the proton [7]. Highprecision measurements at large values of p (W,Z ) T could be sensitive to electroweak (EW) corrections [8].",

Measurements of p T for lepton-pair masses, m , around the Z -boson mass peak have been made by the CDF Collaboration [9] and the D0 Collaboration [10][11][12] at the Tevatron, and the ATLAS Collaboration [13,14], the CMS Collaboration [15,16] and the LHCb Collaboration [17][18][19] at the LHC.

It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS) incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The ID is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A high-granularity silicon pixel detector typically provides three measurements per track, and is followed by a silicon microstrip tracker, which usually provides four three-dimensional measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The transition radiation tracker also provides electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 30 in total) above a higher energy-deposit threshold corresponding to transition radiation.",

Three different 'particle-level' definitions are employed, which differ in their treatment of final-state photon radiation (FSR). The Born and bare levels are defined from the lepton kinematics before and after FSR, respectively. The dressed level is defined by combining the bare four-momentum of each lepton with that of photons radiated within a cone defined by R = 0.1 (See footnote 1) around the lepton. The muon-pair data are corrected to the bare, dressed, and Born levels. The electron-pair data are corrected to the dressed and Born levels. The two lepton-pair channels are combined at the Born level. The bare and dressed particle-level definitions reduce the dependence on the MC FSR model used to correct the data, which results (particularly for events with m below the Z -boson mass peak) in a lower systematic uncertainty. Corrections to a common particle-level definition (Born level) for the combination of the two channels allow comparisons to calculations that do not account for the effects of FSR, albeit at the cost of an increased systematic uncertainty on the corrected data.",

Initial-state QCD corrections to Z -boson production are simulated at approximately nextto-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy using approximate NNLO (i.e. O(\u03b1 2 s )) Wilson coefficient functions [49]. 2 The contributions from \u03b3 * and from Z /\u03b3 * interference are simulated at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy (i.e. O(\u03b1 s )). ResBos uses a resummed treatment of soft-gluon emissions at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy. It uses the GNW parameterisation [49,50] of non-perturbative effects at small p T , as optimised using the D0 \u03c6 * \u03b7 measurements in Ref. [21]. The CT14 NNLO PDF sets [51] are used and the corresponding 90 % confidencelevel PDF uncertainties are evaluated and rescaled to 68 % confidence level. The choices 3 of central values and range of systematic uncertainty variations for QCD scales and the non-perturbative parameter a Z are made following Ref. [49]. 2 We thank Dr M. Guzzi (University of Manchester, UK) for many useful discussions and for helping us to produce the predictions from ResBos to which we compare our measurements. 3 Following Ref. [49] the central value of the non-perturbative parameter a Z = 1.1 GeV 2 is chosen in ResBos. The central values of the QCD scale parameters of the CSS formalism used in ResBos are chosen to be C 1 = C 3 = 2b 0 and C 2 = C 4 = 1/2, where b 0 = e \u2212\u03b3E , where \u03b3 E \u2248 0.577 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. In assigning uncertainties to the predictions of ResBos the value of a Z is varied over the range 1.05 < a Z < 1.19 GeV 2 . The QCD scale uncertainties for the ResBos predictions are evaluated by varying independently the scale parameters C 1 , C 2 and C 3 up and down by a factor of two relative to the central values given above. The relationship C 2 = C 4 is maintained throughout. The overall QCD scale uncertainty is taken as the quadrature sum of the changes in the predicted distribution resulting from the variations in C 1 , C 2 and C 3 . PDF uncertainties are evaluated using the CT14 NNLO PDF error sets.",

The motivation for using a slightly different trigger selection for measurements of the p T observable is to obtain a higher efficiency for electron pairs with R < 0.35, which is relevant to maintain a high acceptance for m < 46 GeV. Electron candidates are reconstructed from clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter matched to ID tracks [55]. They are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, but excluding the transition regions between the barrel and the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52. The electron candidates must satisfy a set of 'medium' selection criteria [55] that have been reoptimised for the larger number of proton-proton collisions per beam crossing observed in the 2012 data. Events are required to contain exactly two electron candidates. Except for the m region 4 The NLO electroweak virtual corrections are provided as fractional difference of calculations performed at the order O(\u03b1 3 \u03b1 s ) compared to O(\u03b1 2 \u03b1 s ). This fractional difference is then applied directly to the O(\u03b1 2 \u03b1 2 s ) QCD calculation from Dynnlo following the prescription of Ref. [67]. The nominal renormalisation (\u03bc R ) and factorisation (\u03bc F ) scales are implemented to take dynamically the value of m 2 + p 2 T . For the evaluation of scale uncertainties the scales \u03bc R and \u03bc F are varied simultaneously by a factor of two up and down.",

Also considered are uncertainties due to mis-modelling of the pile-up distribution and of the distribution of the longitudinal position of the primary vertex, which are estimated by varying the associated MC scaling factor and are treated as correlated between channels. The pile-up uncertainty is a small, but non-negligible contribution to the total systematic uncertainty in most kinematic regions and the vertex uncertainty is generally even smaller.

For p T the uncertainty is quoted as the difference in the results obtained when unfolding the data with Sherpa, as compared to Powheg+Pythia, which is used for the central values. This source results in a significant contribution to the systematic uncertainty in both \u03c6 * \u03b7 and p T for the m region around the Z -boson mass peak.

Here a T [68] is one of the two orthogonal components of p T , which explains the factor of \u221a 2 in scaling from \u03c6 * \u03b7 to p T .

As described above, \u03c6 * \u03b7 provides particularly precise measurements in the region sensitive to the effects of soft-gluon resummation and non-perturbative effects and therefore is the observable used to test the predictions from ResBos.

For values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 < 2 for the m region around the Zboson mass peak the predictions from ResBos are generally consistent with the (much more precise) data within the assigned theoretical uncertainties. However, at larger values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 this is not the case. For the region of m above the Zboson mass peak the predictions from ResBos are consistent with the data within uncertainties for all values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 . For the region of m from 46 to 66 GeV the predictions from Res-Bos lie below the data for \u03c6 * \u03b7 > 0.4. In this context it may be noted that a known deficiency of the ResBos prediction is the lack of NNLO QCD corrections for the contributions from \u03b3 * and from Z /\u03b3 * interference. Similar deviations from the data in the mass region below the Z peak were observed in the D0 measurement in Ref. [23].",

[23], the ratio of (1/\u03c3 ) d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 in different kinematic regions enables a more precise comparison of the predictions with data. For example, the question of whether or not the non-perturbative contribution to p T varies with parton momentum fraction, x, or four-momentum transfer, Q 2 , may be investigated by examining how the shape of (1/\u03c3 ) d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 evolves with |y | and m at low \u03c6 * \u03b7 . Figure 11 shows the ratio of the distribution of (1/\u03c3 ) d\u03c3/ d\u03c6 * \u03b7 in each region of |y | to the distribution in the central region (|y | < 0.4), for events in the m region around the Z -boson mass peak. The distributions are shown for data (with associated statistical and total uncertainties) as well as for ResBos. It can be seen that the uncertainties on the Res-Bos predictions, arising from varying (See footnote 2) the QCD scales, the non-perturbative parameter a Z , and PDFs, are of a comparable size to the uncertainties on the corrected data. The predictions from ResBos are consistent with the data within the assigned uncertainties. Figure 12 shows equivalent comparisons for the m regions from 46 GeV to 66 GeV and from 116 GeV to 150 GeV. It can be seen that the predictions from ResBos are again consistent with the data within the assigned uncertainties. Therefore it can be concluded that ResBos describes the evolution with |y | of the shape of the (1/\u03c3 ) d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 measurements well, and rather better than it describes the basic shape of the data (Figs. 9, 10). Figure 13 shows the ratio of (1/\u03c3 ) d\u03c3/d\u03c6 * \u03b7 in the m region from 116 GeV to 150 GeV to that in the m region from 46 GeV to 66 GeV, for the three divisions of |y |. The ratio is shown for data (with associated statistical and total uncertainties) as well as for ResBos. It can again be seen that the uncertainties on the ResBos predictions, The dark-blue band represents the total uncertainty (statistical and systematic), except for the uncertainty of 2.8 % on the integrated luminosity, which is fully correlated between channels and among all m bins. The \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom is given. The lower plot shows the pull, defined as the difference between the electron-pair and muonpair values divided by the uncertainty on that difference. The fiducial regions to which these cross sections correspond are specified in Table 1. Note that p T is required to be greater than 45 GeV for m < 46 GeV arising from varying (See footnote 2) the QCD scales, the non-perturbative parameter a Z , and PDFs, and shown as a yellow band, are of a comparable size to the uncertainties on the corrected data. For values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 < 0.5 the predictions from ResBos are consistent with the data within the assigned theoretical uncertainties showing that Res-Bos is able to describe the evolution of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution with m . However, at larger values of \u03c6 * \u03b7 this is not the case.",

However, outside this range, and in the regions with very low m , the agreement worsens. For values of p T < 50 GeV for the m region around the Z -boson mass peak the best description is provided by Powheg+Pythia (AZNLO), which was tuned to exactly this kinematic region in the 7 TeV data [14]. However, at high values of p T around the Z -boson mass peak and in other m regions this MC tune does not describe the data well and also does not outperform the Powheg+Pythia AU2 tune.
