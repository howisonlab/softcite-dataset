The results of experimental searches in a variety of final states are interpreted in terms of a set of spin-1 and spin-0 single-mediator dark matter simplified models and a second set of models involving an extended Higgs sector plus an additional vector or pseudo-scalar mediator. The searches considered in this paper constrain spin-1 leptophobic and leptophilic mediators, spin-0 colour-neutral and colour-charged mediators and vector or pseudo-scalar mediators embedded in extended Higgs sector models. In this case, also \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collision data are used for the interpretation of the results. The results are also interpreted for the first time in terms of light scalar particles that could contribute to the accelerating expansion of the universe (dark energy).",

            "text": "The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by a variety of astrophysical measurements, ranging from the rotational speed of stars in galaxies, over precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background [1,2], to gravitational lensing measurements [3][4][5]. However, the nature and properties of the DM remain largely unknown. Searches for particle DM are performed using different complementary approaches: the measurement of elastic scattering of DM by nuclei and electrons in a detector [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14], the detection of Standard Model (SM) particles produced in the annihilations or decays of DM in the universe [15][16][17][18][19], the production of DM particles at colliders [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38], and the study of the effect of DM interactions on astrophysical systems [39,40]. Another major unknown in the physics of our universe, beside the nature of DM, is the origin of its accelerating expansion [41,42]. In the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, this implies the existence of a repulsive force, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate [43]. Assuming general relativity, one of the simplest explanation for this repulsive force is a new type of matter which mimics a constant energy density, thus dubbed dark energy (DE). The effect of DE on cosmological scales is studied by measuring the redshift-distance relation using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, the matter power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background, as well as gravitational lensing [44]. On microscopic scales, DE is probed by laboratory experiments searching for additional gravitational forces that would lead to deviations from the 1/r 2 law [45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53]. Multi-messenger astronomical observations also provide important information for understanding the nature of DE [54][55][56].",

WIMPs can account for the relic density of non-relativistic matter in the early universe [58] measured in data from the Planck [2] and WMAP [1] experiments. For benchmarking purposes it is assumed that WIMPs are Dirac fermions in all models evaluated in this paper. Theories such as R-parity-conserving supersymmetry [59][60][61][62] can also provide such WIMP DM candidates. These models are examined using a wide range of experimental signatures [63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73] in searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. These searches are not included in this paper.",

            "text": "For most of the models in this paper, WIMPs are potentially pair-produced in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [74]. These particles, denoted by the symbol \u03c7 throughout this paper, are stable over cosmological scales and do not interact with the detector. To identify events with DM, additional particle(s), X = jet, \u03b3, W, Z, h, (t)t, (b)b, need to be produced in association with DM in a pp collision, in order to tag the event and detect the recoiling WIMPs as missing transverse momentum (with magnitude E miss T ). If the DM candidates can be produced at the LHC via an s-channel exchange of a new particle, then this mediator could also decay back into SM final states: resonance searches can therefore also be used to constrain DM models. The interplay of resonance and X + E miss T searches depends on the specific model choice and is further outlined in this paper. In the models under study, some of which are new with respect to previous ATLAS publications, one or more new particles mediate the interaction of DM with the SM particles. The first category considers simplified models mediated by a vector, axial-vector, scalar or pseudo-scalar mediator. In the case of simplified vector and scalar mediators, different types of interactions are explored (baryon-charged, neutral-flavour-changing and coloured interactions). The second category considers less simplified models involving an extended Higgs sector plus an additional mediator, either a vector or a pseudo-scalar particle. The assumptions and choices of the models closely follow the work of the DM Forum/LHC DM Working Group [75][76][77][78]. Analyses focusing on signatures compatible with (unstable) longlived particles decaying in the detector volume are also not considered in this paper [79].",

The studies presented in this paper use public ATLAS results. Since no significant excess over the expected SM background was found in any of these analyses, the results are used to constrain the available phase space for DM models. Furthermore, DE models are also constrained using these analyses.",

            "text": "One vector or axial-vector simplified model (V/AV) [75] consists of a simple extension of the SM with an additional U(1) gauge symmetry under which the DM particles are charged. The new mediator (Z ) is either a vector (Z V ) or an axial-vector (Z A ) boson. The model has five parameters [75]: the masses of the mediator and the DM particle (m Z V/A and m \u03c7 , respectively), the flavour-universal coupling of the Z boson to all flavour quarks, g q ; the coupling to all lepton flavours, g ; and the coupling to DM, g \u03c7 . Representative diagrams for this model are shown in figure 1. The Z mediator can decay into a pair of quarks, a pair of leptons, or a pair of DM particles. In the latter case, an additional visible object has to be produced in association with the mediator as initial-state radiation (ISR), as shown in figure 1a. The visible object can either be a jet, a photon or a W or Z boson. In order to highlight the complementarity of dedicated searches based on different final states [77], two coupling scenarios, a leptophobic and a leptophilic Z mediator, respectively, are considered for the interpretation of these models (see section 6.1.1).  Table 1.

It also assumes that the charge of the U(1) symmetry coincides with the baryon number and it is spontaneously broken by a baryonic Higgs scalar. The DM candidate in this model is a stable baryonic state and it is neutral under the SM gauge symmetry. While the model can provide an ISR signature through s-channel Z B -mediator production subsequently decaying into a pair of DM candidates as for the V/AV models described in the previous section (figure 1a), it can also exhibit a distinctive h + E miss T signature [106], as shown in figure 2a. The model has five parameters [106], whose values are chosen to enhance the cross-section for h + E miss T final states relative to traditional ISR signatures. The mixing angle between the baryonic and the SM Higgs bosons, \u03b8, is fixed to sin \u03b8 = 0.3 in order to comply with the current Higgs boson coupling measurements. The coupling of the mediator Z B with the quarks, g q , and the DM, g \u03c7 , are set to 1/3 and 1, respectively. The coupling of the mediator with the Higgs boson, g Z B , is set to the ratio of the mediator mass to the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the baryonic Higgs boson: m Z B /v B . The mediator is naturally leptophobic, thus evading the current constraints coming from the dilepton resonance searches. Different mediator and DM masses are investigated.",

A spin-1 colour-neutral mediator Z VFC enables a flavourchanging interaction of the DM with ordinary matter, for instance between the top quark and the up quark. For simplicity, the mediator is allowed to couple only to the right-handed component of the top-quark field [109]. This model predicts flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes which are suppressed in the SM. A representative diagram of the on-shell production of the new mediator Z VFC is shown in figure 2b. The mediator can either decay invisibly, leading to a final state involving a single top quark and large missing transverse momentum, or decay visibly, producing a distinctive final state containing two top quarks with the same electric charge (tt/tt). A similar topology arises from the t-channel exchange of the Z VFC mediator, as depicted in figures 2c and 2d.",

In the context of the analyses described in this paper, the mass of the DM candidate m \u03c7 has negligible impact on the kinematics, provided that m Z VFC > 2m \u03c7 , and it is fixed to 1 GeV. This reduces the number of dimensions of the parameter space to three.

The latter is composed of a flavour-universal term, g q , which is a free parameter of the model and multiplies the SM-Yukawa coupling for each of the fermions [113]. This particular form of interaction, common to all models with spin-0 mediators evaluated in this paper, is typically referred to as the minimal flavour violation (MFV) ansatz and by construction, it relaxes the severe restrictions on the coupling of new spin-0 colour-neutral particles to the SM fermions imposed by flavour measurements [136][137][138]. Furthermore, it implies that these mediators are sizeably produced through loopinduced gluon fusion or in association with heavy-flavour quarks (see figure 3). According to whether the mediator decays into a pair of DM or SM particles, different final states are sensitive to these models. Due to the Yukawa-like structure of the couplings, visible final states with two or four top quarks are particularly important signatures. Final states involving a single top quark and E miss T may also play an important role in constraining these models [139][140][141][142][143][144]. Despite the absence of a dedicated parameter that regulates the relative importance of up-type and down-type quark couplings (otherwise present in UV completions of these models as in section 2.3.2), it is also important to study final states involving bottom quarks separately, since these become a relevant signature if the up-type couplings are suppressed.",

These models have a strong connection with the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [145,146] with a neutralino DM and firstand second-generation squarks with universal masses. They share with it the same crosssections and phenomenology when the mediator is pair-produced via strong interaction.

This embeds the simplified models in a UV-complete and renormalisable framework and allows the investigation of a broad phenomenology predicted by these types of models. In both models, the 2HDM sector has a CP-conserving potential and a softly broken Z 2 symmetry [157], and the alignment limit is assumed, so that the lightest CP-even state, h, of the Higgs sector can be identified with the SM Higgs boson.

The Z V boson, which can mix with the Z boson, couples only to right-handed quarks and only to the Higgs doublet that couples to the up-type fermions. The CP-odd scalar mass eigenstate, A, from the extended Higgs sector couples to DM particles and complies with electroweak precision measurement constraints. The phenomenology of this model is extended with respect to the simplified case due to the presence of a new decay mode Z V \u2192 hA, as shown in figure 5, with the A boson decaying into a pair of DM particles with a large branching ratio (when kinematically possible), as long as the decay into a pair of top quarks is kinematically forbidden [32]. Additional signatures involving decays of the Z V boson into SM particles or the H and H \u00b1 bosons are possible in the model. However, the model parameters are chosen in order to be consistent with the constraints from searches for heavy-boson resonances on this model [160], and therefore these signatures are not considered further in the context of this interpretation. The model has six parameters [160]: tan \u03b2, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, is set to unity; m \u03c7 , the DM mass, is set to 100 GeV; and g Z , the coupling of the new Z V U(1) gauge symmetry, is set to 0.8. The masses m h and m H = m H \u00b1 of the two CP-even and charged Higgs bosons are set to 125 GeV, and 300 GeV, respectively, while m A , the mass of the CP-odd Higgs partner and m Z V are free parameters and varied in the interpretation.",

The coupling y \u03c7 = 1 is chosen, having a negligible effect on the kinematics in the final states of interest. The alignment and decoupling limit (cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0) is assumed, thus h is the SM Higgs boson and v = 246 GeV. The quartic coupling \u03bb 3 = 3 is chosen to ensure the stability of the Higgs potential for our choice of the masses of the heavy Higgs bosons which are themselves fixed to the same value (m A = m H \u00b1 = m H ) to simplify the phenomenology and evade the constraints from electroweak precision measurements [152]. The other quartic couplings are also set to 3 in order to maximise the trilinear couplings between the CP-odd and the CP-even neutral states. This model is characterised by a rich phenomenology. The production of the lightest pseudo-scalar is dominated by loop-induced gluon fusion, followed by associated production with heavy-flavour quarks or associated production with a Higgs or Z boson (figures 6a-6c). Furthermore, according to the Higgs sector's mass hierarchy, Higgs and Z bosons can be produced in the resonant decay of the heavier bosons into the lightest pseudo-scalar (see for example figures 6d-6f). The pseudo-scalar mediator can subsequently decay into either a pair of DM particles or a pair of SM particles (mostly top quarks if kinematically allowed), giving rise to very diverse signatures. The four-top-quark signature [161] is particularly interesting in this model if the neutral Higgs partner masses are kept above the tt decay threshold, since, when kinematically allowed, all heavy neutral bosons can contribute to this final state, as depicted in the diagram of figure 6c. Four benchmark scenarios [78] that are consistent with bounds from electroweak precision, flavour and Higgs observables are chosen to investigate the sensitivity to this model as a function of relevant parameters: m a , m A , tan \u03b2, sin \u03b8 and m \u03c7 .",

The model contains two classes of effective operators: operators which are invariant under shift-symmetry \u03c6 DE \u2192 \u03c6 DE + constant, where \u03c6 DE denotes the DE scalar field, and operators which break this symmetry. Shiftsymmetric operators contain derivative interactions of \u03c6 DE with the SM particles, while operators that break the shift-symmetry contain direct interactions of \u03c6 DE with the SM.

Reclustered large-R jets are reconstructed from small-R jets using a radius parameter of either R = 0.8 or R = 1.2. Multivariate algorithms are used to identify small-R jets with p T > 20 GeV containing b-hadrons (b-jets) [182,183]. This is referred to as b-tagging. For large-R jets, b-tagging is applied to their associated track-jets, which are constructed from tracks reconstructed in the inner detector using the anti-k t jet algorithm with R = 0.2. The missing transverse momentum p miss T (with magnitude E miss T ) is calculated from the negative vector sum of transverse momenta (p T ) of electrons, muons and jet candidates and an additional soft term [184] which includes activity in the tracking system originating from the primary vertex but not associated with any reconstructed particle.

The analysis selects events with E miss T > 250 GeV, at least one jet with p T > 250 GeV, and at most three additional jets with p T > 30 GeV. Events are required to pass a lepton veto. To reduce the contribution from multi-jet background where large E miss T can originate from jet energy under-measurement, a minimum separation in the azimuthal angle between each selected jet and the E miss T direction is also required: \u2206\u03c6(jet, p miss T ) > 0.4. The W +jets, Z+jets, and top-quark-related backgrounds are constrained using MC event samples normalised to data in selected control regions containing leptons. In the case of W +jets and Z+jets events, MC predictions are reweighted to account for higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections as a function of the vector-boson p T [185]. The normalisation factors for these backgrounds are extracted simultaneously using a binned likelihood fit of the E miss T distributions in all control and signal regions that includes systematic uncertainties. The remaining SM backgrounds from diboson processes are determined using MC simulated samples, while the multi-jet background contribution is extracted from data. plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 . The rapidity is defined at y = 1/2 ln[(E + pz)/(E \u2212 pz)], where E is the energy and pz is the component of its momentum along the z-axis. The rapidity difference between two jets is defined as y * = (y1 \u2212 y2)/2. analysis requires E miss T > 150 GeV and two jets with p T > 35 GeV. Three orthogonal signal regions are defined by varying the threshold imposed on the leading jet p T and the invariant mass of the two jets. Additional requirements on the angular separation of the two jets are applied to enhance the sensitivity to VBF production. In particular, the two leading jets are required to be well separated in pseudorapidity. Lepton and bjet vetoes are applied to reduce contamination from W +jets and top-quark backgrounds, respectively. Dedicated control regions with one and two leptons in the final state are used to constrain the contributions from dominant Z/W +jets backgrounds, through a simultaneous fit together with the signal region. The multi-jet background is estimated using a data-driven technique. Searches for Zh tt + E miss",

The tt +E miss T analysis [25, 27, 28] is split into three channels according to the decays of the W bosons from the top-quark decays: 0-lepton, where both W bosons decay hadronically, 1-lepton, where one of the two W bosons decays leptonically and 2-leptons where both W bosons decay leptonically. The analyses targeting the 0-lepton channel exploit two sets of signal topologies: spin-0 DM models [25], used for the DM interpretations presented in this paper, and top-squark decays into a top quark and a neutralino [28], used for the DE interpretation in this paper. Both analyses are characterised by a set of signal regions which select events with at least four energetic jets, at least two of which are b-tagged, and relatively high E miss T . Requirements on the invariant mass of reclustered large-R jets are imposed to identify events where a W boson or a top quark are boosted. The dominant backgrounds (Z+jets, top-quark processes and tt + Z) are constrained in dedicated control regions. The three signal regions used for the DE interpretation are statistically combined, while the two signal regions in the DM analysis are not.

For the dijet analysis described before, the high p T threshold imposed on the leading jet is limited by the trigger selection driven by the bandwidth available for single-jet triggers, thus it only targets m jj > 1.5 TeV. The limitation from the high-level trigger selection is overcome by recording only high-level trigger jet information, rather than the full detector readout, to a dedicated data stream, reducing the storage needs per event. This strategy allows to record all events passing the single-jet level-one (L1) trigger (with lower threshold than in the high-level trigger) with minimal bandwidth increase. The dataset collected corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 29. Resolved dijet + ISR. Another alternative strategy to search for low-mass dijet resonances is to select events with a pair of jets recoiling against a photon or an additional jet from ISR. The resolved dijet + ISR analyses [195] select events with a high-p T ISR object (\u03b3 or jet), used to trigger the event, and a relatively low mass dijet resonance. Dijet+\u03b3 events contain at least one photon with p \u03b3 > 150 GeV and at least two jets with p T > 25 GeV. The two leading jets must satisfy |y * | < 0.8, which allows to probe of dijet invariant masses between 170 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The three-jet selection requires at least one jet with p T > 430 GeV as well as two additional jets with p T > 25 GeV. The leading jet is chosen as the ISR candidate, and the second-and third-highest-p T jets are required to satisfy |y * | < 0.6. This selection probes a mass range between about 300 GeV and 600 GeV.

In the h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T analysis the systematics uncertainties are not significantly constrained by the fit. This is mainly due to the use of a single signal region and no control regions. In the case of h(bb) + E miss T the systematics uncertainties are constrained due to the use of dedicated control regions. It is observed, however, that the results from the combination and the individual h(bb)+E miss T results are very similar. While the h(bb) + E miss T channel dominates the sensitivity, searches in different decay channels are of interest in probing different kinematic regions defined by different analyses strategies.",

The gap in sensitivity of dijet searches around mediator masses of about 1.7 TeV is due to statistical fluctuation in the dijet spectrum. This benchmark highlights the complementarity among dijet, dilepton, and E miss T +X final states. In this case, dibjet and tt resonance searches are not included in the final result.

The first scenario, presented in figure 15, directly identifies the constraints on the main parameters of the model.

In all cases, a DM mass of 1 GeV is assumed, but the results are valid for all DM mass choices for which the mediator's decay into a pair of DM particles is kinematically allowed (m \u03c6/a > 2m \u03c7 ). Pseudo-scalar mediator models can also be constrained by jet+E miss T final states, where the mediator is produced through loop-induced gluon fusion. Although the limits obtained by this signature are not competitive with the tt +E miss T final state, except in the mass range above 300 GeV, they provide a complementary constraint, which would become particularly important in case of a discovery. For the scalar model, the jet+E miss T final-states cross-section is instead too small to be probed. Ditop resonance searches in final states with two or four tops can also constrain this parameter space for m \u03c6/a > 2m t . However, tt production through a spin-0 resonance presents a strong interference pattern with SM top pair production [208], which needs to be treated with care. On the other hand, four-top final states are characterised by relatively low event yields with the currently available integrated luminosity. For these reasons the study of these final states is not considered here. Finally, bb +E miss T final states are also used to set constraints on these simplified models, resulting in upper limits on the signal strength between 200 and 300 for mediator masses below 100 GeV. These results quantify the sensitivity to these models if up-type couplings are suppressed.  Figure 17.

As visible in the results presented in figure 19a, the exclusion sensitivity is vastly dominated by the h(bb) + E miss T and Z( ) + E miss T analyses in the first scenario. These analyses are mostly sensitive to the production diagrams of figures 6d and 6e and their sensitivity depends on both pseudo-scalar mediator masses. In the context of 2HDM models, it is customary to investigate the sensitivity in terms of the tan \u03b2 parameter. This is achieved in the second scenario presented in figure 19b. Although the exclusion reach is dominated also in this case by the h(bb) + E miss T and Z( ) + E miss T analyses, two additional signatures contribute at tan \u03b2 \u223c 0.5: the tt +E miss T and the tttt analyses. The sensitivity of the former analysis is driven by the production cross-section of the a mediator in association with a top-quark pair and it decreases when the decay of the light pseudo-scalar into a top-quark pair is kinematically allowed and competes with a \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the latter analysis is fairly independent of m a due to the contribution to the total four-top production cross-section from the heavy bosons H/A \u2192 tt, both of which have masses fixed to 600 GeV in this scenario. In the case of the h(bb) + E miss T analysis, the exclusion was not investigated below tan \u03b2 = 0.5. Given the non-trivial dependency of the width on tan \u03b2 in this channel, it is not possible to extrapolate beyond the area explored.",

            "text": "Figures 20a and 20b present the exclusion limits dependence on the mixing angle, sin \u03b8, for a low-mass and high-mass a hypothesis, as evaluated in the third scenario. The limits are expressed in terms of the ratio of the excluded cross-section to the nominal cross-section of the model. For scenario 3a (figure 20a), the lowest cross-section values are excluded by the Z( ) + E miss T and h(bb) + E miss T analyses. The sensitivity of both Z + E miss T analyses monotonically improves as a function of sin \u03b8, as the cross-section of the non-resonant and resonant production diagrams, in figures 6d and 6e respectively, increases with sin \u03b8. Conversely, the same production diagrams for the h + E miss T signatures have very different dependence on the mixing angle [152] in the two m a regimes explored here. The contribution of each diagram is also affected by the different h(bb)+E miss T and h(\u03b3\u03b3)+E miss T analysis selections. For this scenario, both analyses have maximum of sensitivity around sin \u03b8 \u223c 0.5. The three heavy-flavour signatures, bb +E miss T , tt +E miss T and tttt, are presented for different tan \u03b2 assumptions. A value of tan \u03b2 = 50 is studied for bb +E miss T , with the aim of probing the parameter space where the coupling of the a mediator to down-type quarks is enhanced. However, the tt +E miss   Figure 21. Observed exclusion limits for the 2HDM+a model as a function of m \u03c7 , following the parameter choices of scenario 4. The limits are calculated at 95% CL and are expressed in terms of the ratio of the excluded cross-section to the nominal cross-section of the model. The relic density for each m \u03c7 assumption is superimposed in the plot (long-dashed line) and described by the right vertical axis. For DM mass values where the relic density line is below \u2126h 2 = 0.12, the model depletes the relic density to below the thermal value. The two valleys at m \u03c7 = 125 GeV and m \u03c7 = 300 GeV determine the two a-funnel and A-funnel regions [78,209,210] where the predicted relic density is depleted by the resonant enhancement of the processes \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 A/a \u2192 SM. small mixing angles. Scenario 3b, presented in figure 20b, sets the mass of the light pseudoscalar so that the a \u2192 tt decay is kinematically allowed, which introduces an additional sin \u03b8 dependence to the X + E miss T analyses interpreted in this scenario. For this reason, the highest sensitivity for each analysis is found to be broadly around (or slightly below) the maximal mixing condition (\u03b8 = \u03c0/4), except for the tttt and h + E miss T signatures. The tttt signature shows a constant sensitivity as a function of sin \u03b8 (with an increase for very high values) due to the mass assumptions of this scenario (m a = 350 GeV and m A/H = 1 TeV) which cause the tttt production cross-section to be completely dominated by the tt + a(tt) process. The h + E miss T signatures have a complex dependence on the mixing angle. This is due to the different contributions of resonant and non-resonant processes to the final selection in the two analyses. In this case it is possible to observe that the h(bb) + E miss T analysis presents a maximum in sensitivity around the maximal mixing condition. The h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T analysis instead shows a local sensitivity minimum around sin \u03b8 \u223c 0.55. Finally, figure 21 presents the reach of the various experimental searches in a cosmological perspective, following the prescription of the fourth benchmark scenario. In this case, the observed exclusion limits in terms of the ratio of the excluded cross-section to the nominal cross-section of the model are investigated as a function of the DM mass, which is the parameter with the strongest impact on the relic density predicted by the 2HDM+a model. model as a function of the DM mass. The two valleys at m \u03c7 = 125 GeV and m \u03c7 = 300 GeV determine the two a-funnel and A-funnel regions [78,209,210] where the predicted relic density is depleted by the resonant enhancement of the processes \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 A/a \u2192 SM. The plateau around and above m \u03c7 \u223c 200 GeV is determined by the increase in annihilation cross-section of the DM particles close to threshold for \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 ha \u2192 SM and \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 tt. For DM masses around m a /2 or m \u03c7 > 170 GeV the model predicts a relic density which is equal to or below the thermal value, \u2126h 2 = 0.12. As the DM mass increases further, annihilation via single s-channel diagrams is more and more suppressed and the observed DM relic density can again be reproduced. At low values of m a this happens around m \u03c7 \u223c 10 TeV and is outside the range in figure 21. For all X + E miss T signatures considered, the sensitivity is independent of the DM mass as long as the lightest pseudo-scalar mediator, whose mass is fixed at 250 GeV in this scenario, is allowed to decay into a \u03c7\u03c7 pair. The Z( ) + E miss T analysis excludes this parameter space. For higher DM masses, the sensitivity of all analyses quickly decreases and no exclusion is observed. For m \u03c7 > m a /2 all parameter choices that fulfil or deplete the relic density value are still unconstrained.",

The limits are obtained from the search channel (fully hadronic, semileptonic or fully leptonic top pair decays) that provides the smallest expected CL s value.

            "text": "Collider searches. These searches aim to discover DM particles and to measure the DM production cross-section through collisions of high-energy particles. The most stringent results to date on WIMPs are provided by the ATLAS [20-30], CMS [31,32,34,35,229] and LHCb [230,231] experiments at the LHC. Sub-GeV DM candidates are also constrained by the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab [232]. The interpretation of these results closely depends on the underlying mechanisms that couple DM to SM particles. In the simplified model framework considered in this paper this underlying mechanism is assumed to be the production of new mediator(s) state(s) which subsequently decay into DM. The present understanding of the DM puzzle is encompassed in the summary and comparison of the experimental results of these three approaches. Likewise, the discovery of DM as an elementary particle will require determination of its interaction cross-section with SM particles via each of these methods. It is convenient and customary to compare these different approaches in terms of spin-dependent (spin-independent) \u03c7-nucleon scattering cross-sections as a function of the DM mass. In this paper, the ATLAS exclusion limits are converted into bounds on the \u03c7-nucleon scattering cross-sections for the following models:",

            "text": "The spin-dependent WIMP-neutron (WIMP-proton) scattering cross-section in the context of the leptophobic Z A mediator model is shown in the upper (lower) panel of figure 24. The difference between the WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron cross-sections is negligible. The ATLAS exclusion curves are therefore identical in the two panels. The collider searches for this specific leptophobic axial-vector model complement the reach of the direct searches and extend beyond it, being particularly sensitive in the low-DM-mass parameter space, where the LUX and PICO experiments have less sensitivity due to the very low-energy recoils that such low-mass dark matter particles would induce. As in the case of the interpretation of the results in terms of mediator and DM masses (section 6.1.1), if the values chosen for the couplings are reduced, the relative interplay between direct and collider searches changes. This is exemplified by the change of lepton and quark couplings in the leptophilic Z A mediator model shown in figure 25, where the reach of resonant dijet final states is greatly reduced in favour of dilepton searches (differently for the two scenarios) and limited to mediator masses above 200 GeV. The sensitivity of the E miss T + X searches is the same for the two models in figures 24 and 25b. This is a coincidental result of two opposite effects [76]: the fact that the scattering cross-section limit is inversely proportional to the mediator mass reach (raised to the fourth power), which is higher in the leptophobic mediator model (figure 12a), and the fact that the \u03c3 SD limit is proportional to g 2 q , which is lower in the leptophilic mediator model. The spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section results for leptophobic, leptophilic, or baryon-charged vector mediator Z and scalar colour-neutral mediator \u03c6 are compared with the most stringent direct detection limits to date from the LUX, CRESST-II, XENON1T, SuperCDMS and PandaX experiments in figure 26. One contour for each model is presented in the figure and it includes the combination, based on the best expected limit for each parameter point, of every analysis considered for each model and presented in section 6. The excluded regions are indicated by shaded areas inside the contour. As before, when the contour does not close inside the plotted area, the exclusion of smaller scattering cross-sections does not imply that larger scattering cross-sections (beyond the vertical axis range) are also excluded. The collider searches in this case complement the reach of the direct searches for m \u03c7 5 GeV. By comparing the exclusion reach of the ATLAS searches for each of the four models considered in figure 26, it is possible to gauge the importance of the production mechanism assumptions for the collider limits, which represent a complementary and not exclusive approach to DM searches with respect to direct and indirect searches.  Figure 24. A comparison of the inferred limits with the constraints from direct detection experiments on (a) the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron or (b) WIMP-proton scattering cross-section in the context of the Z -like simplified model with axial-vector couplings. The results from this analysis, excluding the region to the left of the contour, are compared with limits from direct detection experiments. LHC limits are shown at 95% CL and direct detection limits at 90% CL. The comparison is valid solely in the context of this model, assuming a mediator width fixed by the dark matter mass and coupling values g q = 0.1, g = 0.1, and g \u03c7 = 1. LHC searches and direct detection experiments exclude the shaded areas. Exclusions of smaller scattering cross-sections do not imply that larger scattering cross-sections are also excluded. The resonance and E miss T +X exclusion region represents the union of exclusions from all analyses of that type.    Figure 25.

Constraints using a VBF+E miss T analysis are also available using \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collision data[188,189]. However, the 8 TeV combination gives more stringent limits, thus it is used here.\u03b3 + E miss T Events in the \u03b3 + E miss T analysis[21] are required to pass the lepton veto and to have a photon with E T > 150 GeV. Events with more than one jet (p T > 30 GeV) or with a jet fulfilling \u2206\u03c6(jet, p miss T ) < 0.4 are rejected. Three exclusive signal regions with E miss T ranges between 150 GeV, 225 GeV, 300 GeV and above are defined. The W \u03b3, Z\u03b3, and \u03b3+jets backgrounds are normalised in control regions using a simultaneous likelihood fit of all E miss T regions, but with independent normalisation factors for each region. The backgrounds due to photons from the misidentification of electrons or jets in processes such as W/Z+jets, diboson, and multi-jet events are estimated using data-driven techniques.Z( ) + E miss T The event selection criteria in this analysis [24] require large E miss T and a pair of high-p T leptons. Two opposite-sign, same-flavour leptons satisfying p T > 30 GeV and p T > 20 GeV are required. The lepton pair is required to have an invariant mass between 76 GeV and 106 GeV to be consistent with originating from a Z boson. Events with an additional lepton with p T > 7 GeV or a b-jet with p T > 20 GeV are vetoed. To target events consistent with a boosted Z boson produced in the direction opposite to p miss T , additional requirements are imposed on the azimuthal angle between the dilepton system and p miss T and on the angular distance between leptons. A single inclusive E miss T signal region is defined with E miss T > 90 GeV for each of the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels. The dominant background in this analysis, ZZ production, is estimated from MC simulation. The W Z background is normalised to data in a three-lepton control region. The contributions from Z+jets and non-resonant-backgrounds are estimated using data-driven techniques. A statistical combination of the two decay channels is used for the final results. (qq )/Z(qq) + E miss T This analysis [20] selects events with E miss T > 150 GeV and a hadronically decaying W or Z boson candidate. The vector-boson candidate is defined with one large-R jet with p T > 250 GeV in a boosted topology (E miss T > 250 GeV) or with two small-R jets with p T > 20 GeV in a resolved topology. In both cases, a lepton veto is applied. Additional requirements are applied to the invariant mass of the boson candidate. Several signal regions are defined according to the b-jet multiplicity. Similarly, several control regions are defined according to lepton and b-jet multiplicity. The normalisations of the tt and W/Z+jets background processes are constrained using a simultaneous fit of all control and signal regions of the E miss T distribution. The subdominant contribution from diboson and single-top-quark production is obtained from simulation. Multi-jet contributions are estimated with a data-driven technique. h(bb) + E miss T The h(bb) + E miss T analysis [23] is defined by the requirement of E miss T > 150 GeV, a lepton veto, and the presence of a Higgs boson candidate decaying to two b-jets with suitable invariant mass. Events with mis-measured E miss T are rejected by imposing constraints on \u2206\u03c6(jet, p miss T ), between the missing momentum direction and the direction of any selected jet in the event. Two sets of signal regions are defined targeting moderatemomentum (resolved) and high-momentum (boosted) Higgs boson candidates. In each case, the regions are further split according to whether there are one or two b-jets. The resolved regime, defined in three exclusive E miss T regions between 150 GeV and 500 GeV, selects a Higgs boson candidate reconstructed from the two leading b-tagged small-R jets (or from a b-tagged and a non-b-tagged small-R jet) with p T > 20 GeV. In the boosted regime, defined by E miss T > 500 GeV, the leading large-R jet with p T > 200 GeV is the Higgs boson candidate. The b-jet multiplicity is defined by the number of b-tagged track-jets associated with the large-R jet. Backgrounds involving the production of W/Z bosons in association with heavy-flavour quarks or top-quark pairs are normalised in dedicated control regions distinct from the signal regions by requiring one or two leptons. A simultaneous binned likelihood fit to the invariant mass of the Higgs boson candidate is performed in all signal and control regions. The multi-jet background is obtained with a data-driven technique. Other subdominant backgrounds are estimated from simulation. h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T The h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T events in this analysis [22] are selected by requiring at least two photons with p T > 25 GeV. The two leading photons are chosen to reconstruct the Higgs candidate, which is required to satisfy 105 GeV < m \u03b3\u03b3 < 160 GeV. The leading (sub-leading) photon is also required to have E \u03b3 T /m \u03b3\u03b3 > 0.35 (0.25). Events with leptons are vetoed. Events with p T (\u03b3\u03b3) > 90 GeV and E miss T / E T > 7 GeV 1/2 in ref. [22] are used for the interpretation of DM models, where E T is the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of all reconstructed objects in the event. The backgrounds are extracted by fitting an analytic function to the diphoton invariant mass distribution. In the case of the non-resonant background, the normalisation and shape are obtained by fitting the invariant mass distribution in data to an exponential function. The SM Higgs boson background shape is modelled with a double-sided Crystal Ball function and fitted to the MC simulation. The t+E miss T analysis [30] searches for events with one top quark and relatively large E miss T . Two signal regions are defined depending on the decay channel of the top quark. The leptonic channel selects events with a positively charged lepton with p T > 30 GeV, E miss T > 50 GeV, and transverse mass of the lepton and the E miss T , m W T , larger than 260 GeV. One b-jet with p T > 30 GeV is additionally required. The hadronic channel is optimised to select events with a top quark produced with a large boost. Events are selected with E miss T > 200 GeV and one large-R jet with p T > 250 GeV with one b-tagged track-jet associated with it. Events failing the lepton veto are rejected. Dedicated control regions are defined to constrain the tt and W/Z+jets backgrounds from data. The multi-jet background is estimated from data, whereas other remaining backgrounds are taken from simulation. All signal and control regions for the two decay channels are fitted simultaneously to extract the background normalisation. In the case of the hadronic channel, the transverse mass of the large-R jet and the E miss T are the discriminating variables, while for the leptonic channel, the E miss T distribution is used to discriminate signal from background. b(b) + E miss T . The b + E miss T analysis [25] selects events with two energetic jets (p T > 160 GeV), at least one of which is b-tagged, E miss T > 650 GeV, and additional total hadronic energy restricted to be less than 100 GeV. This last requirement rejects top-quark background. The dominant background for this analysis, Z+jets events, is constrained from data in a dedicated control region, which is fitted together with the signal region. The bb +E miss T analysis [25] instead exploits a selection with at least two b-jets and a considerably lower E miss T requirement, E miss T > 180 GeV. The azimuthal separations between the b-jets and p miss Tare exploited to enhance the separation between the signal and the irreducible background in this channel (Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+bb), which is constrained from data in a dedicated control region. The results are extracted by fitting an observable that relies on the pseudorapidity difference between the two b-jets: cos \u03b8 * bb = |tanh (\u2206\u03b7 bb /2)|.",

The analyses presented are based on up to 37 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions data at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The h(inv) analysis considers up to 4.7 fb \u22121 at centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb \u22121 at centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. The results from the searches presented are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions, thus results are translated into exclusion limits on mediator-based dark matter and dark energy models. Results on simplified models with the exchange of a vector or axial-vector mediator in the s-channel with Dirac fermions as dark matter candidates are compared across different visible and invisible final states. In particular, additional interpretations for these models are presented for Z( ) + E miss T , W/Z(qq ) + E miss T and all resonance searches except for boosted dijet + ISR. Masses of leptophobic (leptophilic) vector and axial-vector mediators between 200 GeV and 2.5 TeV (3.5 TeV), for coupling values g q = 0.25 and g \u03c7 = 1, and m \u03c7 = 1 TeV, are excluded at 95% CL. Results from h(bb) + E miss T and h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T final states are compared in this paper in the context of a baryon-charged interaction; masses of the Z B boson are excluded up to 1.9 TeV for m \u03c7 = 1 GeV and coupling values of g \u03c7 = 1 and g q = 1/3. Strong limits on a flavour-changing mediator model are set thank to two complementary search approaches targeting visible and invisible decays of the mediator, Z VFC . Masses up to 1.85 TeV for coupling values of g q = 0.35 and g \u03c7 = 1.0 are excluded for invisible decays, while g q coupling values between 0.14 and 0.35 for mediator masses between 1 TeV and 3 TeV are excluded for visible decays. Exclusion limits for simplified model of dark matter production including a colourneutral scalar (pseudo-scalar) mediator are compared for tt +E miss T , bb +E miss T and jet+E miss T final states. Mediator masses below 45 GeV (in the range 15-25 GeV) are excluded for dark matter particles with m \u03c7 = 1 GeV and g \u03c7 = 1. Masses for colour-charged JHEP05(2019)142mediators, coupling to first-and second-generation left-handed quarks, are excluded up to 1.7 TeV, for m \u03c7 = 50 GeV for g \u03c7 = 1. Colour-charged mediators that couple to righthanded b-quarks (t-quarks) are excluded for masses up to 1.4 TeV (3.4 TeV) for low dark matter masses.A first interpretation of an extended two-Higgs-doublet model with an additional pseudo-scalar, a, which couples the dark matter particles to the Standard Model is used to study the broad phenomenology with diverse final-state signatures predicted by this type of model.Masses of the pseudo-scalar mediator, a, are excluded up to 350 GeV for m A = m H = m H \u00b1 = 1 TeV, sin \u03b8 = 0.35 and tan \u03b2 = 1.0. The Z( ) + E miss T and h(bb) + E miss T searches are the most sensitive analyses in this high mediator-mass region. Previously published limits on a two-Higgs-doublet model with an additional vector mediator are improved upon by the statistical combination of the two decay channels studied: h(bb) + E miss T and h(\u03b3\u03b3) + E miss T . Mediator masses between 400 GeV and 2.5 TeV are excluded for dark matter masses of 100 GeV.",
