This search uses 20.3 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Signatures based on high jet multiplicities without requirements on the missing transverse momentum are used to search for R-parity-violating supersymmetric gluino pair production with subsequent decays to quarks. The analysis is performed using a requirement on the number of jets, in combination with separate requirements on the number of b-tagged jets, as well as a topological observable formed from the scalar sum of the mass values of large-radius jets in the event. Results are interpreted in the context of all possible branching ratios of direct gluino decays to various quark flavors. No significant deviation is observed from the expected Standard Model backgrounds estimated using jet counting as well as data-driven templates of the total-jet-mass spectra. Gluino pair decays to ten or more quarks via intermediate neutralinos are excluded for a gluino with mass m~g < 1 TeV for a neutralino mass m~\u03c70",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model (SM) which fundamentally relates fermions and bosons. It is an alluring theoretical possibility given its potential to solve the naturalness problem [10][11][12][13][14][15] and to provide a dark-matter candidate [16,17]. Partially as a result of the latter possibility, most searches for SUSY focus on scenarios such as a minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) in which R-parity is conserved (RPC) [18][19][20][21]. In these models, SUSY particles must be produced in pairs and must decay to a stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). With strong constraints now placed on standard RPC SUSY scenarios by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), it is important to expand the scope of the SUSY search program and explore models where R-parity may be violated and the LSP may decay to SM particles, particularly as these variations can alleviate to some degree the fine-tuning many SUSY models currently exhibit [22].",

The reduced sensitivity of standard SUSY searches to RPV scenarios is due primarily to the high missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) requirements used in the event selection common to many of those searches. This choice is motivated by the assumed presence of two weakly interacting and therefore undetected LSPs. Consequently, the primary challenge in searches for RPV SUSY final states is to identify suitable substitutes for the canonical large E miss T signature of RPC SUSY used to distinguish signals from background processes. Common signatures used for RPV searches include resonant lepton pair production [23][24][25], exotic decays of long-lived particles, and displaced vertices [26][27][28][29].",

Cases in which pairproduced massive new particles decay directly to a total of six quarks, as well as cascade decays with at least ten quarks, are considered. Three-body decays of the type shown in Fig. 1 are given by effective RPV vertices allowed by the baryon-number-violating \u03bb 00 couplings as described in Sec. II with off-shell squark propagators. This analysis is an extension of the search conducted at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV for the pair production of massive gluinos, each decaying directly into three quarks [30]. The diagrams shown in Fig. 1 represent the benchmark processes used in the optimization and design of the search presented in this paper. The extension to considering cascade decays of massive particles creates the potential for significantly higher hadronic final-state multiplicities and motivates a shift in technique with respect to previous searches. Therefore, the analysis is extended to look for events characterized by much higher reconstructed jet multiplicities as well as with event topologies representative of these complex final states. Two complementary search strategies are thus adopted: a jet-counting analysis that searches for an excess of \u22656-jet or \u22657-jet events, and a data-driven template-based analysis that uses a topological observable called the total jet mass of large-radius (large-R) jets. The former exploits the predictable scaling of the number of n-jet events (n \u00bc 6; 7) as a function of the transverse momentum (p T ) requirement placed on the n th leading jet in p T for background processes. This analysis is sensitive to the models presented here because this scaling relation differs significantly between the signal and the background. The latter analysis uses templates of the eventlevel observable formed by the scalar sum of the four leading large-R jet masses in the event, which is significantly larger for the signal than for the SM backgrounds.",

The jet-counting analysis is presented in Sec. VI, while the total-jet-mass analysis using more advanced observables is presented in Sec. VII. The combined results of this search and the final sensitivity to the benchmark processes are then described in Sec. VIII. The results using the total-jet-mass analysis are presented first, in Sec.

The L i , Q i represent the lepton and quark SU\u00f02\u00de L doublet superfields, whereas H 2 is the Higgs superfield.

In general, the particle content of the RPV MSSM is identical to that of the RPC MSSM but with the additional interactions given by W R p . Generically, the addition of W R p into the overall SUSY superpotential allows for the possibility of rapid proton decay. The simultaneous presence of lepton-numberviolating (e.g. \u03bb 0 \u2260 0) and baryon-number-violating operators (\u03bb 00 \u2260 0) leads to proton decay rates larger than allowed by the experimental limit on the proton lifetime unless, for example [33],",

In the case of nonzero \u03bb and \u03bb 0 , the typical signature involves leptons in the final state.

Those limits are driven by double nucleon decay [35] (for \u03bb 00 112 ), neutron oscillations [36] (for \u03bb 00 113 ), and Z boson branching ratios [37]. Hadron collider searches are hindered in the search for an all-hadronic decay of new particles by the fact that the SM background from multijet production is very high. Nonetheless, searches have been carried out by several collider experiments. The CDF Collaboration [38] excluded gluino masses up to 240 GeV for light-flavor models. The CMS Collaboration [39] excludes such gluinos up to a mass of 650 GeV and additionally sets limits on some heavy-flavor UDD models. The ATLAS Collaboration [30] has also previously set limits in a search for anomalous six-quark production, excluding gluino masses up to 666 GeV for light-flavor models. The search presented here uniquely probes the flavor structure of the UDD couplings and employs new techniques both in analysis and theoretical interpretation.",

VIII, the analysis maintains approximately equal sensitivity to all flavor modes. All samples are produced assuming that the gluino and neutralino widths are narrow and that their decays are prompt.

This method first clusters together topologically connected calorimeter cells and classifies these clusters as either electromagnetic or hadronic. The classification uses a local cluster weighting calibration scheme based on cell-energy density and longitudinal depth within the calorimeter [60]. Based on this classification, energy corrections derived from single-pion MC simulations are applied. Dedicated corrections are derived for the effects of noncompensation, signal losses due to noise-suppression threshold effects, and energy lost in noninstrumented regions. An additional jet energy calibration is derived from MC simulation as a correction relating the calorimeter response to the true jet energy. In order to determine these corrections, the identical jet definition used in the reconstruction is applied to particles with lifetimes greater than 10 ps output by MC generators, excluding muons and neutrinos. Finally, the standard jets are further calibrated with additional correction factors derived in situ from a combination of \u03b3 \u00fe jet, Z \u00fe jet, and dijet balance methods [60].",

Since the simulation is not guaranteed to predict this scaling perfectly, crosschecks in the data and a data-driven determination of systematic uncertainties are performed as described in Sec. VI C. It is assumed here that the simulation used for this extrapolation given by PYTHIA 6.426 predicts the relative rate of events with one additional order in the strong coupling constant in a consistent way across jetmultiplicity regions. This assumption comes from the behavior of the parton shower model used by PYTHIA to obtain configurations with more than two partons and is shown to be consistent with data in the measurement of multijet cross sections [66]. Other models were studied and are discussed in Sec. VI C. Small corrections from other backgrounds (tt, single top, and W=Z \u00fe jet events) are applied based on estimates from the simulation.

This template is randomly sampled 2500 times for a single jet p T and \u03b7, and a precise predicted distribution of possible masses for the given jet is formed. 4 For an event with multiple jets, the jet mass templates are applied to each jet and the resulting predicted mass distributions are combined to predict the total jet mass M \u03a3 J for that ensemble of jets. Jet mass templates are applied to jets in events in orthogonal regions, typically with at least four large-R jets-the control (4jCR), validation (4jVR), and signal regions (4jSR)-but also in the 3jCR to test the method. Samples used in this way are referred to as the kinematic samples. The only information used is the jet p T and \u03b7, which are provided as inputs to the templates. The result is referred to as a dressed sample, which provides a SM prediction of the individual jet mass distributions for the jets in the kinematic sample. A SM prediction for the total jet mass can then be formed by combining the individual dressed jet mass distributions. The normalization of the M \u03a3 J prediction-the dressed sample-is preserved such that the total expected yield is equal to the number of events in the kinematic sample. The procedure can be summarized as [69] (1) Define a control region to obtain the training sample from which jet mass templates are to be constructed; (2) Derive a jet mass template binned in jet \u03b7 and p T using a smoothed Gaussian kernel technique; (3) Define a kinematic sample as either another control region or the signal region; (4) Convolve the jet mass template with the kinematic sample using only the jet p T and \u03b7; (5) Obtain a sample of dressed events which provides the data-driven background estimate of M \u03a3 J . The key assumption in this approach is that the jet kinematics factorize and are independent of the other jets in the event. Deviations from this approximation may occur due to effects that are not included in the derivation of the jet mass templates. In particular, the composition of quarks and gluons can vary across different samples [73], and quark and gluon jets have been observed to have different radial energy distributions [74]. Other experimental affects, arising from close-by or overlapping jets, can also have an effect. For this reason, extensive tests are performed in the 4jCR and 4jVR, as defined in Sec. VII B, to estimate the size of the correction factors needed to account for any sample dependence, and to assess systematic uncertainties. The entire procedure is tested first in SHERPA multijet MC simulation, which shows minimal differences between the template prediction and observed mass spectrum.",

Since the sensitivity to increased BR\u00f0c\u00de comes from b-tagging configurations that are designed to efficiently select b-jets, the effect on the signal acceptance is dominated by BR\u00f0b\u00de. For this reason, the focus of this discussion is on the BR\u00f0b\u00de degree of freedom. However, several results with various values of BR\u00f0c\u00de are presented below. VI. Requirements as optimized for the ten-quark model under a variety of mass hypotheses when all \u03bb 00 couplings are nonzero and equal and b-tagging requirements are considered as part of the optimization procedure. The optimized signal region selection requirements are shown along with the resulting background and signal expectations and the number of observed data events. The nominal signal acceptance (including efficiency) is also shown for each result. Quoted errors represent both the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The results of performing the limit-setting procedure on the data in the signal regions are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 for various flavor branching ratio hypotheses as a function of gluino mass for the six-quark model. These results show both the expected and observed cross-section limits in comparison to the predicted cross section from the theory. Under the assumption that all RPV decays are to lightflavor quarks \u00f0BR\u00f0b\u00de \u00bc BR\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc BR\u00f0c\u00de \u00bc 0%\u00de, gluino masses of m~g < 853 GeV (expected) and mg < 917 GeV (observed) are excluded at the 95% CL. Alternatively for the scenario where BR\u00f0b\u00de \u00bc 100% while the other heavyflavor branching ratios are zero, exclusions of m~g < 921 GeV (expected) and mg < 929 GeV (observed) are found. Similarly, for the case where BR\u00f0b\u00de \u00bc BR\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 100%, exclusions of mg < 938 GeV (expected) and mg < 874 GeV (observed) are found. More generally, excluded masses as a function of the branching ratios of the decays are presented in Figs. 14 and 15 where each bin shows the maximum gluino mass that is excluded for the given decay mode.",

Two strategies are used for both background estimation and signal discrimination. An inclusive data-driven analysis using the total jet mass with a template method for background estimation is performed as well as a jetcounting analysis that includes exclusive heavy-flavor signal regions and provides limits on different branching ratios for the benchmark SUSY RPV UDD decays. For the ten-quark model, results from both analyses are presented with comparable conclusions. When the jetcounting analysis includes sensitivity to heavy flavor given by b-tagging requirements, mass exclusions are further increased. Exclusion limits at the 95% CL are set extending up to m~g \u00bc 917 GeV in the case of pair-produced gluino decays to six light quarks and up to mg \u00bc 1 TeV in the case of cascade decays to ten quarks for moderate mg \u2212 m~\u03c70 1 mass splittings.
