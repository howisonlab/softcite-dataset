The inclusion of the LHCb observables improves the precision of the D \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 coherence factor significantly, but lowers the central value with respect to that returned by the CLEO-c fit. In this region the 1\u03c3 bound on \u03b4 K 3\u03c0 D is weaker, although the results for this parameter become significantly more Gaussian in behaviour. The reduction in the uncertainty on r K 3\u03c0 D is largely driven by the correlation with the mixing parameters x and y, which are constrained through external measurements in the fit.",
