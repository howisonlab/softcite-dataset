We find clear \u03a5(10860) and \u03a5(11020) peaks with little or no continuum contribution. We study the resonant substructure of the \u03a5(11020) \u2192 h b (nP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transitions and find evidence that they proceed entirely via the intermediate isovector states Z b (10610) and Z b (10650). The relative fraction of these states is loosely constrained by the current data: the hypothesis that only Z b (10610) is produced is excluded at the level of 3.3 standard deviations, while the hypothesis that only Z b (10650) is produced is not excluded at a significant level.",

In such states, the quarks are moving relatively slowly, and therefore a non-relativistic approximation based on the interaction potential accurately describes the basic properties of the system [1]. The first state that did not fit potential model expectations was observed in 2003 by Belle [2]; since then, nearly twenty such states have been reported [3]. All these states correspond to high excitations and have masses above the DD or BB thresholds.",

The partial widths of the corresponding transitions are much higher than expected for conventional quarkonia [8]. Surprisingly, the peaks observed in the cross sections depend on the final states. In other words, each such charmonium-like state decays to only one channel with charmonium. To explain this \"selectivity\", a hadrocharmonium notion is introduced [9]: a bound state of a charmonium and a light hadron. Such a system decays predominantly into its constituents.",

The observed decay patterns of \u03a5(10860) and \u03a5(11020) agree with the expectations for a mixture of the B  [12]. The striking difference between charmonium-like and bottomonium-like states, that we describe above, is not yet understood. Further scans in the bottomonium region are therefore of high importance. In this Letter, we report the first energy scan of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (nP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (n = 1, 2) cross sections.

The fit function is the sum of the h b (nP ) signal and combinatorial-and peaking-background components. The shapes of the h b (nP ) signals are determined by convolving the probability density of the initial state radiation (ISR) process with the experimental resolution, described by a Gaussian. We use the ISR probability, calculated up to the second order [21], and take into account the energy dependence of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 h b (nP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross sections using an iterative procedure. The resolution is determined using the exclusively reconstructed decays \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 to be (6.84 \u00b1 0.13) MeV/c 2 for the h b (1P ) and (6.15\u00b10.22) MeV/c 2 for the h b (2P ). The resolution is dominated by c.m. energy smearing. The h b (nP ) masses are fixed at the previous Belle measurement [18]. We normalize the signal density functions in such a way that the measured h b (nP ) yields include the ISR correction, 1 + \u03b4 ISR , and can be used directly to measure the Born cross sections. The combinatorial background is described by a fourth-order Chebyshev polynomial in both fit intervals. The order is chosen by maximizing the confidence level of the fit.",

The corresponding M miss (\u03c0\u03c0) spectra are fitted using the same procedure as described above (see Figs. 2 and 3). The h b (nP ) signal density functions are determined by averaging over the data samples that are combined; we use weights proportional to the integrated luminosity and the cross section at each energy. We note that the h b (1P ) and h b (2P ) peaks are shifted by about 2.5 MeV/c 2 , and the width of the h b (2P ) peak is narrower by 1.2\u03c3 compared to the fit. The shift could be due to a miscalibration of the c. m. energy, and is accounted for in the systematic uncertainty. The narrow width is likely a statistical fluctuation. The confidence levels of the fits are 50% and 52%, respectively. From Wilks' theorem [25], we find that the significances of the h b (1P ) and h b (2P ) signals are 3.5\u03c3 and 5.3\u03c3, respectively, including systematic uncertainty, determined by varying the polynomial order. Thus, we find the first evidence for the \u03a5(6S) \u2192 h b (1P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transition and observe for the first time the \u03a5(6S) \u2192 h b (2P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transition. We release the requirement of an intermediate Z b and fit the M miss (\u03c0\u03c0) spectra in bins of M miss (\u03c0) to measure the h b (nP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 yields as functions of M miss (\u03c0). The distribution of the phase-space-generated signal events in the M miss (\u03c0 + ) vs. M miss (\u03c0 \u2212 ) plane has the shape of a narrow slanted band; each structure at high values of M miss (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) produces a \"reflection\" at small values of M miss (\u03c0 \u2213 ). We combine the M miss (\u03c0\u03c0) spectra for the corresponding M miss (\u03c0 + ) and M miss (\u03c0 \u2212 ) bins and consider the upper half of the available M miss (\u03c0) range. Thereby, we consider all signal events and avoid double counting. The yields, corrected for the reconstruction efficiencies, are shown in Fig. 4. The data are not distributed uniformly in phase space; they populate the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) mass region. We fit the data to a shape where the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) parameters are fixed to the \u03a5(5S) \u2192 Z b \u03c0 \u2192 h b (1P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 result and the non-resonant contribution is set to zero [14]. Such a model describes the data well: the confidence levels of the fits are 65% and 77% for the h b (1P ) and h b (2P ), respectively. The phase space hypothesis is excluded relative to this model at the 3.6\u03c3 and 4.5\u03c3 levels in the h b (1P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and h b (2P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channels, respectively. The single Z b (10610) hypothesis is excluded at the 3.3\u03c3 level in the h b (1P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, while the single Z b (10650) hypothesis cannot be excluded at a significant level. In the h b (2P )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, the Z b (10610) \u00b1 and Z b (10650) \u00b1 signals overlap with the Z b (10650) \u2213 and Z b (10610) \u2213 reflections, respectively, which obscures the determination of the relative yields. The exclusion levels are determined using pseudo-experiments from the \u03c7 2 differences of the two hypotheses being compared, and include systematic uncertainty.",

We study their resonant substructures and find evidence that they proceed entirely via the intermediate isovector states Z b (10610) and Z b (10650). Their relative fraction is loosely constrained by the current data: the hypothesis that only Z b (10610) is produced is excluded at the 3.3\u03c3 level, while the hypothesis that only Z b (10650) is produced is not excluded at a significant level.",
