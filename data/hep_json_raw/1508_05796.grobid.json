Data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2012 from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , are analysed. Top-quark pair-production events with one top quark decaying through the t \u2192 q Z (q = u, c) channel and the other through the dominant Standard Model mode t \u2192 bW are considered as signal. Only the decays of the Z boson to charged leptons and leptonic W boson decays are used. No evidence for a signal is found and an observed (expected) upper limit on the t \u2192 q Z branching ratio of 7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (8 \u00d7 10 \u22124",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known, with a mass m t = 173.21 \u00b1 0.51(stat.) \u00b1 0.71(syst.) GeV [1]. Its lifetime is so short that, within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, it decays (almost exclusively to bW ) before hadronisation occurs. These properties make it a particle well suited to test the predictions of the SM. In the SM, due to the GIM mechanism [2], flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays such as t \u2192 q Z are forbidden at tree level. They are allowed at one-loop level, but with a suppression factor of several orders of magnitude with respect to the dominant decay mode [3]. However, several SM extensions predict higher branching ratios (BRs) for the top-quark FCNC decays. Examples of such extensions are the quark-singlet model (QS) [4], the two-Higgs-doublet model with (FC 2HDM) or without (2HDM) flavour conservation [5], the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) [6], supersymmetry with R-parity violation ( / R SUSY) [7] or e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch models with warped extra dimensions (RS) [8]. For a review see Ref. [9]. The maximum values for the t \u2192 q Z BRs predicted by these models and by the SM are summarised in Table 1. Experimental limits on the FCNC t \u2192 q Z BR were established by experiments at the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) [10][11][12][13][14], HERA [15], Tevatron [16,17] and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [18,19]. The most stringent limit, BR(t \u2192 q Z) < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , is the one from the CMS Collaboration [19] using 25 fb \u22121 of data collected at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV. Previous ATLAS results obtained at \u221a s = 7 TeV are also reported [18]. Limits on other FCNC top-quark decay BRs (t \u2192 q X, X = \u03b3, g, H ) are reported in Refs. [10][11][12][13][14][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28].",

Only the decays of the Z boson to charged leptons and leptonic W boson decays are considered. The finalstate topology is thus characterised by the presence of three isolated charged leptons, at least two jets, and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. The paper is organised as follows. A brief description of the ATLAS detector is given in Sect. 2. The collected data samples and the simulations of signal and SM background processes are described in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the object definitions, while the event analysis and kinematic reconstruction are explained in Sect. 5. Background evaluation and sources of systematic uncertainty are described in Sects. 6 and 7. Results are presented in Sect. 8 and conclusions are drawn in Sect. 9.",

It is composed of an inner tracking system close to the interaction point and immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field produced by a thin superconducting solenoid, a lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter, an iron/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter, copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeter and a muon spectrometer with three superconducting magnets, each one with eight toroid coils. The forward region is covered by additional LAr calorimeters with copper and tungsten absorbers. The combination of all these systems provides charged-particle momentum measurements, together with efficient and precise lepton and photon identification in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. Energy deposits over the full coverage of the calorimeters, |\u03b7| < 4.9 are used to reconstruct jets and missing transverse momentum (with magnitude E miss T ). A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events. The Level-1 trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to a design value of at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels which together reduce the event rate to less than 1 kHz. A detailed description of the ATLAS detector is provided in Ref. [29].",

It was checked that the coupling choice does not affect the kinematics of the event. No impact in the kinematics is seen by comparing the bW u Z and bW cZ processes and the latter is used as reference. Only decays of the W and Z bosons involving charged leptons are generated at the matrixelement level by PROTOS (Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and W \u2192 e\u03bd, \u03bc\u03bd, \u03c4 \u03bd).

Events with non-prompt leptons or in which at least one jet is misidentified as an isolated charged lepton (labelled as \"fake leptons\" throughout this paper) can also fulfil the event selection requirements. These events, typically Z + jets, Z + \u03b3 , tt and single-top, are estimated from a data-driven method using a parameterisation of the true-and fake-lepton efficiencies. Samples of simulated events of these backgrounds with fake leptons are used to cross-check the data-driven estimation. The Z +jets simulations include Z production in association with heavy-flavour quarks. Table 2 summarises the information about the generators, parton shower and parton distribution functions used to simulate the different event samples considered in the analysis. Diboson events (W Z and Z Z, where Z means Z /\u03b3 * ) produced using SHERPA contain up to three additional partons and are selected to have leptons with p T > 5 GeV and m > 0.1 GeV for the Z /\u03b3 * . The additional W Z and Z Z samples are used for comparison. The W Z ALPGEN samples are simulated with up to five additional partons from the matrix element. The Z Z HERWIG [51] samples are selected to have one lepton with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8. The simulations of tt Z, tt W (W ), t Z and tribosons include events with up to two extra partons in the final state. The simulated samples used to cross-check the data-driven estimation of background with fake leptons are also listed in Table 2.",

Two of the leptons are required to have the same flavour, opposite charge and a reconstructed mass within 15 GeV of the Z boson mass (m Z ) [1].

The expected limit is computed by replacing X d with the median of the statistical test for the background hypothesis (X b ). The limits on the number of signal events are converted into upper limits on the t \u2192 q Z branching fraction using the NNLO + NNLL calculation, and uncertainty, for the tt cross section, and constraining BR(t \u2192 bW ) = 1\u2212BR(t \u2192 q Z).  Table 9 shows the observed limit on BR(t \u2192 q Z) together with the expected limit and corresponding \u00b11\u03c3 bounds. These values are calculated using the reference tt \u2192 bW cZ sample, since it gives a more conservative result than the tt \u2192 bW u Z sample. The smaller b-tagged jet multiplicity of the tt \u2192 bW u Z signal sample leads to an improvement of 4 % in the limit. Figure 4 compares the 95 % CL observed limit found in this analysis with the results from other FCNC searches performed by the H1, ZEUS, LEP (combined results of the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL collaborations), CDF, D\u00d8 and CMS collaborations.
