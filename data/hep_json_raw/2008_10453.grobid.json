Multifractal moments, G q , as the function of pseudorapidity bin size for different order of the moments, q, have been calculated. The power-law behaviour has been observed in the considered data sets. The variations of multifractal dimension, D q , and the multifractal spectral function, ( ) q f \u03b1 , with order of the moments, q, have been studied thoroughly. D q is found to decrease with increasing order of moments, q, indicating thereby a self-similar behaviour in the multiparticle production for the considered collisions. We have also found a concave downward curve of multifractal spectral function with maximum at q = 0.",

The concept of self-similarity is closely related to the fractal theory which is a natural consequence of the cascading mechanism prevailing in the multiparticle production process. The power law behaviour, scaled factorial moments, indeed implies the existence of some kind of fractal pattern [2] in the dynamics of particles produced in their final state of reaction.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the cascading mechanism [3] of multiparticle production in the framework of the multifractal technique, a formalism has been de-veloped by R.C. Hwa [4]  [5] for a systematic study of the fractal properties and it also provides an effective means of defining non-uniform rapidity distribution of produced particles in nuclear collisions. The aim of this technique is to verify the authenticity of basic scaling properties, which occur in multifractal theories, when applied to particle production for the dynamical mechanism responsible for the hadronisation process in nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions [6] [7] [8]. The explanation of cascading as self-similar process in analogy with geometrical objects such as fractals has been allowed by scaling law [9]. Some workers [10]  [11] have proposed entropy based tools which are commonly used to describe the dynamics of complex systems. In the last few decades, it has been observed that Tsallis entropy and multifractal technique are found to be useful to characterize on large scale scaling behaviour. Furthermore, the Shannon, Reyni and Tsallis entropies [12] related formalisms are used as multifractal measures. However, the concept of divergence is being employed to quantify the departure between two distributions. It is one of the most used divergences related to the Tsallis entropy.",

Further, the variation of mass exponent, q \u03c4 , with the order of the moment, q, shows a power law behavior. As far as multifractality is concerned, a decreasing trend in the variation of multifractal dimension, q D , with q is observed. This indicates the presence of multifractality in the particle production process for the considered nuclear reactions. The observed behavior of multifractal spectral function ( ) q f \u03b1 in pseudorapidity space manifests self similarity in the mechanism of multiparticle production",

In the present paper, an attempt is made to investigate various interesting features of multifractality in 16 O-AgBr collisions at 60A and 200A GeV. The Hwa's proposal which is based on the general theory of multifractals [16] [17] allows us to estimate mass exponent, \u03c4 q , generalized dimension, D q and multifractal spectral function( ) q f \u03b1 for different order of the moments. These parameters serve as the measure of the multifractal structure in the considered data sets.",
