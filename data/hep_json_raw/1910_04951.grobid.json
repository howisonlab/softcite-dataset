Here we demonstrate the potential of this low-energy neutrino experiment as a probe for physics Beyond the Standard Model, by using the recently published results to constrain two simplified extensions of the Standard Model with light mediators. We compare the new limits with those obtained for the same models using neutrinos from the Spallation Neutron Source. Our new constraints represent the best limits for these simplified models among the experiments searching for CE\u03bdNS for a light vector mediator with mass M Z < 10 MeV, and for a light scalar mediator with mass M \u03c6 < 30 MeV. These results constitute the first use of the CONNIE data as a probe for physics Beyond the Standard Model.",

            "text": "Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE\u03bdNS) is a Standard Model (SM) process predicted more than 40 years ago [1] through which a neutrino interacts coherently with all nucleons present in an atomic nucleus, resulting in an enhancement of the scattering cross section. The enhancement is approximately proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus. However, despite its large cross section, this process took a long time to be observed due to the difficulty of measuring the low-energy nuclear recoils produced by the neutrino-nucleus scattering events. Recently, CE\u03bdNS was detected by the COHERENT collaboration [2] thanks to the development of novel detectors and the unique neutrino beam facility of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",

The CON-NIE engineering run, carried out in 2014-2015, is discussed in [22]. The detector installed in 2016 has an active mass of 73.2 g (12 CCDs) and is located 30 m from the core of the Angra 2 nuclear reactor, which has a thermal power of 3.95 GW. The CONNIE detector is sensitive to recoil energies down to 1 keV. A search for neutrino events is performed by comparing data with the reactor on (2.1 kg-day) and the reactor off (1.6 kg-day), the results show no excess in the reactor-on data [23].

This approach shows the potential of experiments searching for CE\u03bdNS with low-energy reactor neutrinos to probe new physics in a way that is complementary to spallation neutrino experiments. The models we consider contain an additional light mediator: 1) a neutral vector boson Z , with mass M Z , and 2) a scalar mediator \u03c6, with mass M \u03c6 . These simplified models represent a straightforward way to parametrize the reach for new physics in the low-energy neutrino sector, as discussed in ref. [24]. Testing such extensions of the SM is interesting since there are no constraints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments when the mediator mass is below the GeV scale [12]. From the theoretical side, these models have attracted considerable attention because, among other things, they connect to new ideas associated with sub-GeV dark matter in the range of MeV to GeV [12,25].",

This allows us to set the limit R N SI < R SM \u00d7 41 for 0.075 keV < E M < 0.275 keV (or recoil energies 0.784 keV < E R < 1.834 keV). This limit is presented in ref. [23] as a model independent limit for a counting experiment in the lowest energy bin for the data in CONNIE. Here, we study this limit in the context of light mediators, as discussed in section 2. The upper limits resulting from higher energies are weaker because the SM prediction drops fast as the energy increases. For the next energy bin, 0.275 keV < E M < 0.475 keV, the limit is R N SI < R SM \u00d7 84. For this reason we perform the search for the two extensions of the SM described in section 2, using only the lowest-energy bin of the limits published by the CONNIE Collaboration in ref. [23].

Our analysis produces the best limits among the experiments searching for CE\u03bdNS in the low-mass regime, M Z < 10 MeV in the case of a vector and M \u03c6 < 30 MeV in the case of a scalar, extending beyond the region excluded by the COHERENT results shown in refs.

This is related to the fact that CONNIE is looking at a flux of lower-energy antineutrinos. Higher-energy nuclear recoils produced by neutrinos from the SNS give access to the structure function in eq. (23), which allows to explore nuclear physics, and have the unique advantage of timing discussed in ref. [12]. However, the results coming from neutrinos from nuclear reactors have the advantage of being practically free of the uncertainties coming from the not well known nuclear structure, as the form factor in eq. (2.3) can be approximated to unity. Moreover, because of their lower energy thresholds, reactor experiments provide a more powerful probe into new physics at low energies, such as the signatures expected for the simplified light mediators models. This makes evident the complementarity of two different techniques to explore new physics with neutrinos from reactor (CONNIE) and from the Spallation Neutron Source (COHERENT).",

More powerful limits are expected when spectral information of the CONNIE data is included in the analysis. Additionally, the CONNIE collaboration has recently modified the operation of the detector, performing hardware binning on the CCDs (adding charge of several pixels before readout) and reducing the effect of readout noise for the low-energy events. This operating mode improves the efficiency of the detector at low energies. Updated results using data taken with this mode are expected soon.",
