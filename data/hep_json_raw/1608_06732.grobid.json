By constraining the ratio of decay rates of D + s to \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 and to \u00b5 + \u03bd\u00b5 to the Standard Model prediction, the branching fractions are determined to be B(D + s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u00b5) = (0.495 \u00b1 0.067 \u00b1 0.026)% and B(D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 ) = (4.83 \u00b1 0.65 \u00b1 0.26)%. Using these branching fractions, we obtain a value for the decay constant f D + s of (241.0 \u00b1 16.3 \u00b1 6.5) MeV, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic.",

            "text": "where m D + s is the D + s mass, m is the lepton mass, G F is the Fermi coupling constant, |V cs | is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix [2] element which takes the value equal to |V ud | of 0.97425 (22)  [3], and f D + s is the decay constant that is related to the wave-function overlap of the quark and anti-quark. The D + s meson leptonic decay is a process in which a spin-0 meson decays to a left-handed neutrino or a right-handed antineutrino. According to angular momentum conservation, the lepton + ( \u2212 ) must be left-handed (right-handed). As a consequence, the leptonic decay of D + s meson is helicity-suppressed, which follows from the m 2 dependence of the decay width. Taking the phase-space factor (1\u2212m 2 /m 2 D + s ) 2 into account, the leptonic branching fractions are in the ratio e + \u03bd e : \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 : \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 : 1 : 10. The decays to \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 can be measured experimentally, while e + \u03bd e is beyond the sensitivity of the BESIII experiment. Recently, the CLEO [4], BABAR [5], and Belle [6] Collaborations have published updated measurements of the branching fractions of D + s leptonic decays and the decay constant f D + s , resulting in the new world average f D + s = (257.5 \u00b1 4.6) MeV [7]. Theoretical predictions of f D + s [8][9][10][11][12][13] are lower than this value. The most precise predictions are from Lattice QCD, the combined (2 + 1)and (2 + 1 + 1)-flavor result is (249.0 \u00b1 1.2) MeV. There is an approximately 2 standard-deviation difference between the experimental average and the lattice QCD calculations. Several models of physics beyond the SM, such as the two-Higgs-doublet model [14] and the R-parityviolating model [15], may help to understand this difference. It is important to further investigate this difference both theoretically and experimentally.",

We determine the single-tag yields by fitting the M BC distributions. In the fits, we use the MC-determined signal shapes convolved with a Gaussian function with free mean and resolution to model the signal and an ARGUS [27] function for the background. We accept the events satisfying 1.962 < M BC < 1.982 GeV/c 2 for further analysis. This range contains about 95% of the signal events. In events containing a selected tag candidate, we search for the D + s leptonic decays to \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 (\u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 +\u03bd \u03c4 ) by using the other final-state particles that are not used to reconstruct the D \u2212 s tag. We require that there is exactly one good charged track in the signal side, and that the charge of the track is opposite to the D \u2212 s tag. The track satisfies the selection criteria (without PID requirements) for charged tracks given in Sec. III. We also require the energy of the most energetic neutral cluster in the EMC not associated with the tag D \u2212 s to be less than 300 MeV to eliminate background events that contain photon(s). If there are multiple D + s candidates in an event, we only keep the one with the D \u2212 s tag with the smallest |\u2206E| for further analysis.

After all selection criteria are imposed, a total of 104 events survive, which is equivalent to 7.0 \u00b1 0.7 events for the 482 pb \u22121 of data. For the analysis, we fix the shape and size of this background in the MM 2 fits.

The uncertainty due to the single-tag yield is estimated by varying the fit range and background shape. The uncertainty due to the efficiency of finding a muon or charged pion is taken to be 1% per track [30]. The uncertainty from the efficiency of the extra shower requirement is studied with the hadronic control samples \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), \u03c8(2S) \u2192 3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and \u03c8(2S) \u2192 K + K \u2212 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). We fully reconstruct these three samples and measure the efficiencies for the extra shower requirement for data and MC, respectively. The efficiency difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties related to the MM 2 fits include the MM 2 resolution, MM 2 fit range, background estimation and signal fractions in subsamples. The uncertainty from the MM 2 resolution is estimated by changing the resolution of the convolved Gaussian function in signal shape; the uncertainty from the MM 2 fit range is estimated by shifting the range by \u00b110 (MeV/c 2 ) 2 ; the uncertainty due to the background is estimated by varying the number of background events by \u00b11\u03c3, assuming that the number of background events follow a Poisson distribution, for the real-D s background, and varying the sideband range and background shape for the non-D s background; the uncertainty from the relative signal fractions in the sub-samples is estimated by varying the fractions by \u00b11 statistical error. The systematic error associated with Dobrescu and Kronfeld's calculation [28] of the contribution of the \u03b3\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decay mode could be 1% of the lowest-order mechanism for photon momenta below 300 MeV. We take 100% of this correction value, which is 1%, as the systematic error. In addition to these, we have considered uncertainties arising from B(\u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 +\u03bd \u03c4 ) [7] and MC statistics of the detection efficiencies.  ",

The measured decay constant f D + s is consistent with the average of the Lattice QCD calculations [8][9][10][11][12][13].
