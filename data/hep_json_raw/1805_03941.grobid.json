By contrast, no CP violation has been observed in the baryon sector to date. However, sizeable CP -violating asymmetries of up to 20% are expected in certain b-baryon decays [1], will either confirm the CKM mechanism in baryon decays, or will bring insights into new sources of CP violation. Recently the first evidence for CP violation in \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays has been reported by the LHCb collaboration, with a statistical significance corresponding to 3.3 standard deviations [2].",

The magnetic field is reversed periodically in order to cancel detection asymmetries. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at 5 GeV/c to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information JHEP08(2018)039 from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors.

The \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, which is the final state of interest with the largest yield, is used to train the classifier, since its kinematics and topology are very similar to those of \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 K + K \u2212 and \u039e 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The signal training sample is obtained by subtracting the background using the sPlot technique and a fit to the invariant mass distribution [27]. The candidates from the sideband, 5.85 < m(pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) < 6.40 GeV/c 2 , are selected as the background training sample. The discriminating variables included in the BDT are the proton transverse and longitudinal momenta p T and p z ; the impact parameter of the K and \u03c0 candidate tracks with respect to the X 0 b primary vertex; the \u03c7 2 of the X 0 b decay vertex fit; the angle between the X 0 b momentum and its flight direction; the X 0 b \u03c7 2 IP ; the asymmetry between the transverse momentum of the X 0 b and that of the charged tracks contained in a region defined as \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c6 2 < 1.0, where \u2206\u03b7 (\u2206\u03c6) is the difference of pseudorapidity (azimuthal angle) between the candidate and the charged tracks. The most important discriminating variables are the proton transverse and longitudinal momentum, and the angle between the X 0 b momentum and its flight direction. No correlation is found between the discriminating variables or between the BDT output and the reconstructed b-baryon candidate mass. The signal and background training samples are divided into three statistically independent subsamples with equal number of candidates, on which k-fold cross-validation is applied [28]. The BDT selection criteria are optimised by maximising S/ \u221a S + B, where S (B) is the expected signal (background) yield. The expected yield is estimated using S = S S 0 (B = B B 0 ), where the signal (background) efficiency S ( B ) of each BDT selection requirement is evaluated using \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (data sideband) control samples; the reference signal (background) yield, S 0 (B 0 ), is obtained from a fit to the reconstructed invariant mass in the range [5.5 \u2212 5.7] GeV/c 2 before applying the BDT selection.",

An average systematic uncertainty, discussed in section 5, is assumed for all bins. The statistical uncertainties are considered uncorrelated among the bins, while systematic uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated. The results are consistent with the CP -symmetry hypothesis with a p-value of 0.93 (0.55), based on \u03c7 2 /ndf= 7.2/14 (10.8/12) for scheme A (B) and a p-value of 0.95 (0.99), based on \u03c7 2 /ndf= 2.1/7 (2.2/10) for scheme C (D).

The main source of systematic uncertainty is due to the experimental reconstruction and analysis technique, which could introduce potential biases in the measured asymmetries. This is tested by measuring the asymmetry a T -odd CP (\u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 ) for the Cabibbo-favoured \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode, where negligible CP violation is expected. The measured asymmetry is consistent with zero with a statistical uncertainty of 0.31%, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty for a T -odd CP for the integrated measurement over the full phase space. The systematic uncertainty on a T -odd P is identical to that on a T -odd CP , as follows from eq. (1.3). To assess the systematic uncertainty for the measurements in regions of the phase space, the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c (\u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 \u2212 control sample is split in ten bins of the angle \u03a6 between the decay planes of pK \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The resulting distribution of a T -odd CP is fitted with various models, all of which give results consistent with no asymmetry with a statistical precision of 0.6%. This statistical precision is assigned as a systematic uncertainty in each bin of the different binning schemes A, B, C and D.",
