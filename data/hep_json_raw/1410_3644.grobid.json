Studying baryonic B decays can also allow a better understanding of the mechanism of these decays and, more generally, of the baryon production process.",

Changing the signal description for m B and m ES from a sum of two Gaussian functions with fixed shape parameters to a single Gaussian function of which the parameters are determined in the maximum likelihood fit leads to an uncertainty of 3.1%.
