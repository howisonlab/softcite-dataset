            "text": "Since the discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] with a mass of 125 GeV [4,5], the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have actively searched for additional neutral and charged Higgs bosons. Most theories beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics enrich the SM Higgs sector; a simple extension is the assumption of the existence of two Higgs doublets [6][7][8][9]. Such models are collectively labeled as two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), and are further classified into four categories according to the couplings of the doublets to fermions. In Type-I models, only one doublet couples to fermions, while in Type-II models one doublet couples to the up-type quarks and the other to the down-type quarks and the charged leptons. In lepton-specific models one doublet couples only to the leptonic sector and the other couples to quarks, while in flipped models the first doublet couples specifically to the down-type quarks and the second one to the up-type quarks and charged leptons.",

Supersymmetric (SUSY) models have a Higgs sector based on 2HDMs [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Among the SUSY models, a popular one is the minimal supersymmetric extension to the SM (MSSM) [16,17], whose Higgs sector is described by a Type-II 2HDM. In the MSSM, the production and decay of these particles are described at tree level by two free parameters, which can be chosen as the mass of the charged Higgs boson (m H \u00b1 ) and  Figure 1.

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The final state contains two W bosons, one from the decay chain of the heavy charged Higgs boson and the other from the decay of the associated top quark. One or both of the W bosons can decay into leptons, producing single-lepton and dilepton final states, respectively. The leptonic decays of tau leptons from the W boson decay are considered as well. The single-lepton final state is characterized by the presence of one isolated lepton (e, \u00b5) that is used to trigger the event, while the dilepton final state contains events with two isolated opposite-sign leptons (e + e \u2212 , e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). This leads to the suppression of several backgrounds. The signal process (tbH + +tH + ) has furthermore a large b jet multiplicity; an additional classification of the events is therefore achieved based on the number of jets identified as originating from b quarks.",

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [47]. The first level, composed by specialized hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors, while the second level consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a JHEP01(2020)096 definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [48].",

The energy of photons is obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object squared transverse momentum (p 2 T ) is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex [81]. The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [82,83] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum ( p miss T ), taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. Electrons are identified using an MVA-based identification algorithm [84]. Working points are defined [85] by setting thresholds for the classifier values to mitigate efficiency losses for high-p T electrons observed particularly in high-mass signal events; such working points are labeled Tight (\u224888% efficiency for tt events) and Loose (\u224895% efficiency for tt events). They result in an efficiency in selecting high-mass signal events of \u224890%, ap-JHEP01(2020)096 proximately flat across the electron high-p T range. Muon identification uses the algorithm described in ref. [86] and two working points, referred to as Medium and Loose, with efficiencies of about 97 and 100%, respectively. Thresholds in p T and \u03b7 for electrons and muons depend on whether they are used for selecting or vetoing events and are detailed in section 5.",

Jets are reconstructed from the PF particles clustered by the anti-k T algorithm [82,83] with a clustering radius of 0.4. To mitigate the effect of pileup interactions, charged hadrons that do not arise from the primary vertex are excluded from the clustering. Furthermore, jets originating from pileup interactions are removed by means of an MVA identification algorithm [89]. The jet momentum is then corrected in simulated events to account for multiple effects, including the extra energy clustered in jets arising from pileup. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and in simulation, and appropriate corrections are applied [90]. Jets are selected if they satisfy p T > 40 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Loose identification criteria are applied to the jets, in order to distinguish them from well-identified stable particles.

In the single-lepton category, only events with exactly one lepton are accepted, whereas the presence of any additional lepton passing the loose identification requirements with p T > 10 GeV vetoes the event. Moreover, the presence of a \u03c4 h candidate with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3 vetoes the event. In the dilepton category, we accept events with exactly two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons); the second lepton is required to have p T > 10 GeV and pass looser identification criteria than the leading lepton. To reduce the Z/\u03b3 * background, we reject events with two leptons of the same flavor and opposite charge with an invariant mass m less than 12 or between 76 and 106 GeV.",
