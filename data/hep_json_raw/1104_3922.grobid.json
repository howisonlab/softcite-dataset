            "text": "The disappearance of muon neutrinos as they propagate from their production source is well established by experimental evidence accumulated over the last several decades [1][2][3][4][5]. Although the deficit of \u03bd \u00b5 charged-current (CC) interactions is generally interpreted as due to oscillations between the weak flavor states of active neutrinos, with \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 transitions representing the dominant channel [4][5][6], more exotic scenarios where active neutrinos oscillate into an unseen sterile neutrino flavor, \u03bd s , are not excluded. The possible existence of one or more light sterile neutrinos, in addition to the three active flavors, has been widely discussed [7] and could contribute to the understanding of the neutrino mass spectrum [8] or explain apparent differences in behavior between neutrino and antineutrino oscillations [9]. Interest in sterile neutrinos has been renewed with the latest observations from antineutrino running in the MiniBooNE experiment, which may be explained by mixing models incorporating one or more sterile neutrinos [10]. Furthermore, recent results from the WMAP experiment might suggest the existence of a fourth neutrino generation with mass less than 0.58 eV [11].",

            "text": "MINOS can probe active to sterile neutrino mixing driven by the atmospheric mass-squared splitting by measuring the rate of neutral-current (NC) events at two locations, over a baseline of 735 km. Because NC crosssections are identical among the three active flavors, NC event rates are unaffected by standard neutrino mixing. However, oscillations into a sterile non-interacting neutrino flavor would result in an energy-dependent depletion of NC events at the far site. This letter reports results from a search for sterile neutrino mixing, using a data sample twice as large as that used in previous publications [12]. The data are compared to models where these neutrino oscillations are driven either by the atmospheric mass scale \u2206m 2 32 alone or along with a masssquared splitting \u2206m 2 43 having magnitude O(1 eV 2 ). MINOS measures neutrinos from the NuMI beam [13] using two detectors: the 980 t (27 t fiducial) Near Detector (ND), located 1.04 km downstream of the beam target at Fermilab; and the 5.4 kt (4.0 kt fiducial) Far Detector (FD), placed 735 km downstream of the target in the Soudan Underground Laboratory, in Minnesota [14]. The detectors are planar steel/scintillator tracking calorimeters. Each plane is composed of 2.54 cm thick steel and 1 cm thick plastic scintillator arranged in 4.1 cm wide strips. The energy resolution function for neutrino-induced hadronic showers is approximately 56%/ \u221a E [15]. The data were collected in an exposure of 7.07 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target taken exclusively with a beam configuration for which the peak neutrino event energy is 3.3 GeV. The NuMI beam includes a 1.3% (\u03bd e +\u03bd e ) contamination primarily from the decay of muons originating in kaon and pion decays.",

The total activity recorded during a spill is separated into activity slices using timing and spatial criteria [4]. Ideally, each activity slice would correspond to one neutrino interaction, but some failure modes result in one activity slice containing information from different interactions, for which separate events may then be reconstructed. Simulations show that these failure modes increase the number of interactions selected as NC with reconstructed energy (E reco ) lower than 1 GeV by 37% in the ND. This background is reduced to 11% by removing a reconstructed event if it contains less than half of the total energy deposited in the activity slice, or if the event has fewer than three contiguous planes with at least two photoelectrons read out in each plane [16].",

Events that fail both NC criteria are selected as CC if they pass the classification procedures used by the MINOS muon neutrino CC disappearance analysis [5]; otherwise they are removed from the analysis.

Therefore, the depletion of the total NC event rate is less than 3.2% (11.2%) at 90% C.L., where the value in parentheses is obtained assuming \u03bd e appearance.  The data are compared with two models of neutrino oscillations that allow admixture with one sterile neutrino. In the first model, identified as m 4 = m 1 , the first and fourth mass eigenstates are treated as degenerate and the oscillatory behavior is assumed to be driven only by the atmospheric mass scale. The second model, referred to as m 4 \u226b m 3 , assumes a large difference between the fourth and third mass eigenstates, introducing an additional mass scale \u2206m 2 43 with magnitude O(1 eV 2 ), so that no oscillation-induced change of the neutrino event rate is measurable at the ND site, but rapid oscillations are predicted at the FD location. The latter model is also sensitive to portions of the region of interest studied in the MiniBooNE antineutrino data [22]. Detailed descriptions of these models are provided in Refs. [12] and [23].",

For both sterile oscillation models, the limit set on the disappearance fraction is f s < 0.22 (0.40) at the 90% C.L. This limit represents a 57% improvement on the previous limit set by MINOS if \u03bd e appearance is neglected [12], achieved from increased statistics and the reduction of systematic uncertainties in this analysis.  The dominant systematic uncertainties were reevaluated, in some cases with more sensitive methodologies, leading to reductions from the previous analysis. Visual scanning techniques were used to asses the recon-struction algorithms allowing a reduction of the uncertainty due to the relative normalization between the two detectors from 4% to 2.2% [18]. The absolute scale of the hadronic energy contributes a maximum of 10% to the uncertainty for E reco \u2264 0.5 GeV to a minimum of 6.5% when E reco > 10 GeV. This new treatment combines a constant 5.6% uncertainty in the detector response to single hadrons with an energy-dependent uncertainty due to hadronization model and intranuclear effects [25]. The uncertainty on the relative energy scale between detectors, computed from inter-detector calibration studies, is 2.1%. The uncertainty due to ND-specific selections, determined by varying each selection criterion to assess its effects in the ND energy spectrum, is 10% for E reco \u2264 1 GeV, between 4.8% and 2.1% for 0.5 GeV < E reco \u2264 2.5 GeV, and negligible for higher energies [16]. The uncertainties stemming from FD-specific selections, evaluated in the same manner as the ND-specific ones, are calculated to be 5% for E reco \u2264 0.5 GeV, and between 2.5% and 1% for 0.5 GeV < E reco \u2264 120 GeV. The uncertainty in the size of the \u03bd \u00b5 -CC background, computed using ND data acquired in different beam configurations [12,18], remains 15%.",
