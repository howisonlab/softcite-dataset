It is performed using the Inner Tracking System (ITS) in stand-alone mode, both for track reconstruction and particle identification, allowing one to detect low momentum particles with p t below 200 MeV/c. A second method using the tracks reconstructed by both the ITS and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has also been developed. The obtained results will be compared with the ones obtained from the TPC and from the Time Of Flight detector and used to extract the mean p t value.",

            "text": "The calculation of the identified charged hadron spectra in the ITS is based on the measurement of the particle energy loss in 4 (SSD and SDD) out of 6 Silicon layers. The ITS sub-systems have been aligned and commissioned using the cosmic data taken by the ALICE experiment in 2008, for more details see [3,4,5]. To achieve a precise charge calibration, the distribution of charge per unit path length has been measured and fine tuned for each module of the SDD and the SSD. In figures 1 and 2 it is possible to see that the peaks of the charge distributions are centered at the same value with a tolerance less than 5%. Two independent analyses have been performed using two different ITS track samples: the stand-alone ones, reconstructed using only information from the ITS (6 silicon layers) and the global ones, that use all the ALICE tracking detectors. In any case, only tracks with 3 or 4 points localized in the SDD and SSD are used in the analysis. The charge deposit measured in each layer is normalised to the energy loss per 300 \u00b5m (thickness of the ITS layers) of Silicon using the track local angles as reconstructed by the tracking algorithm. In the case of SDD clusters, a linear correction for the dependence of the reconstructed raw charge as a function on drift time due to the combined effect of charge diffusion and zero suppression is also applied [6]. For each track, dE/dx is calculated using a truncated mean: the average of the lowest two points in case 4 points are measured, or a weighted sum of the lowest (weight 1) and the second lowest point (weight 1/2) in case 3 points are measured. Figure 3 shows the energy loss signal so obtained in the ITS as function of the momentum for stand-alone tracks, compared to the parametrised response for pions, kaons and protons. This parametrisation in based on the Bethe-Bloch formula from [7], with an additional correction for the low momentum part. For each track fulfilling the track quality requirements, the rapidity is calculated using three different mass hypotheses: pion, kaon and proton. Tracks with |y| < 0.5 are selected. For each hypothesis in p t bins, a histogram is filled with the difference between the logarithm of the measured energy loss signal in the ITS and expected value calculated using the variable",

            "text": "This procedure gives a series of three histograms for each charged particle in all p t bins. Figure 4 shows an example of these distributions for the kaon mass hypothesis.  The area below the peak centered at zero is the raw yield of particles from the mass hypothesis in given p t bin. The raw yield is determined by fitting the histograms with functions show in the figure 4: a sum of three Gaussians for the ITS stand-alone analysis and a sum of a Gaussian with an exponential tail and the tail of the peak at lower dE/dx for the TPC+ITS analysis. The raw yield is then corrected for the contamination from secondary particles and the overall efficiency. This has been calculated by using a Monte-Carlo simulation of the collisions and the detector in the same configuration of the data taking period. Figure 5 shows the overall efficiencies for the ITS stand-alone analysis for positive pions, kaons and protons. They take into account the geometric acceptance, the tracking efficiency, the dead channels and the K decays. After the correction, performed separately for each analysis, the yields have been normalized to the number of the inelastic collisions. The first important result is the coherence between the four independent analyses: ITS stand-alone, ITS+TPC, TPC and TOF. In figure 6 the matching of the points for the three positive species is observable. It is thus possible to cover the whole transverse momentum range from 90 MeV/c to 2.5 GeV/c. The spectra have been combined weighting for the uncorrelated systematic errors and fitted using the L\u00e9vy function [8]:",
