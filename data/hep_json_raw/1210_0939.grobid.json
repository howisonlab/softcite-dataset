We adopt a convention in which \u03b4 corresponds to a strong phase, which vanishes in the SU(3) limit [11]. The magnitude r of the amplitude ratio is approximately 0.06. In this article, we update an analysis [12] that first directly determined cos \u03b4 using correlated production of D 0 andD 0 mesons in e + e \u2212 collisions produced at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring and collected with the CLEO-c detector.

As a result, the D 0D0 decay rates differ from incoherent decay rates because of interference effects. These differences depend on y (to first order) and on strong phases of the decay amplitudes [11,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. As in our previous analysis, we implement the double-tagging method with a \u03c7 2 fit described in Ref. [23], where, in addition to extracting the number of D 0D0 pairs produced (N ) and the branching fractions (B) of the reconstructed D 0 final states, we simultaneously determine y, x 2 , r 2 , cos \u03b4, and sin \u03b4, all without needing to know the integrated luminosity or D 0D0 production cross section. The main improvements in the current analysis are: use of the full CLEO-c \u03c8(3770) dataset (which is three times larger than the previous dataset), reconstruction of additional CP eigenstates, reconstruction of semimuonic D 0 decays, addition of modes that provide sensitivity to sin \u03b4, and direct measurement of the amplitude ratio r.",

The current analysis also uses D \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, and the above CP asymmetries would bias our determinations of cos \u03b4 and sin \u03b4 from these modes by O(10 \u22122 ). By itself, this bias is much smaller than our experimental uncertainties, but its effect is further diluted by our use of additional CP eigenstates in the analysis. CP violation in mixing and in the interference between mixing and decay would bias our measured value of y. However, we are insensitive to these sources of CP violation at the levels currently allowed by experimental constraints [27].",

We also reconstruct K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K + \u00b5 \u2212\u03bd \u00b5 without using the CLEO muon chambers because they are insensitive to muons in the momentum range of interest (p \u00b5 < 1 GeV/c).

We fit the U distributions to signal and background probability distribution functions (PDFs) derived from simulated events and from sidebands in M and \u2206E for the hadronic tag. For DCS modes, because of the low background, we simply count the number of events in the signal region |U | < 0.352 GeV, and we estimate a relative background contribution of O(10 \u22123 ) from simulated events.

We tested the analysis technique using a simulated sample of quantum-correlated D 0D0 decays with an effective integrated luminosity of 10 times our data sample. In Tables XVII and XVIII, we show the results of two fits: one with no external inputs (Standard Fit) and one including the measurements in Table XIV (Extended Fit). The fits are performed using both statistical and systematic uncertainties on the input measurements. We evaluate statistical uncertainties on the fit parameters by performing a second set of fits using only statistical uncertainties on the inputs. Then, we compute the systematic uncertainty on a given fit parameter by taking the quadrature difference between its total uncertainty and its statistical uncertainty. When a fit parameter is directly constrained by an external measurement, we quote only one uncertainty. Asymmetric uncertainties are determined from the likelihood scans discussed below. Table XIX gives the correlation coefficients for y, r 2 , cos \u03b4, sin \u03b4, and x 2 . The full correlation matrices can be found on EPAPS [43].",

Accounting for correlated uncertainties, the results for cos \u03b4 in the Standard and Extended Fits differ by 2.5\u03c3. This difference is caused primarily by the upward fluctuations in y and r 2 in the Standard Fit, which are both negatively correlated with cos \u03b4. The above factor of three improvement in y and r cos \u03b4 can be attributed in equal parts to the increased size of the dataset and to the additional final states in the current analysis. In particular, the new K 0 L modes (including {Ke\u03bd e , K 0 L \u03c0 0 }) reduce the statistical uncertainties on y and r cos \u03b4 in the Standard Fit by roughly 10%, and the K\u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 modes reduce them by 20-30%. The K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 measurements from Ref. [29] have a similar effect on y and r cos \u03b4 as the new K 0 L modes, but they also provide all the information on sin \u03b4 in the Standard Fit. The Extended Fit demonstrates that when our cos \u03b4 and sin \u03b4 measurements are used to combine y and y from other experiments, the overall uncertainty on y is reduced by approximately 10% compared to the global average of all measurements in Table XIV (except y CP from Ref. [5]) found in Ref. [40]: y = 0.79 \u00b1 0.13. Note that this global average includes the results from Ref. [12]. Figure 9 shows the one-dimensional posterior PDFs for cos \u03b4, sin \u03b4, \u03b4, and y in the Standard Fit, including statistical and systematic uncertainties. These curves are obtained by   \u2022 . The effect of these measurements on the world averages of mixing parameters is to improve the uncertainty on y by approximately 10%.",
