State of the art theoretical predictions are given by the fixed-order plus next-to-leading logarithm (FONLL) approach [1][2][3]. In these calculations, the dominant uncertainties arise from the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scales, and the assumed b-quark mass [4]. The primary products of bb hadronisation are B + , B 0 , B 0 s and their charge-conjugate states (throughout the paper referred to as B mesons) formed by oneb quark bound to one of the three light quarks (u, d and s). Accurate measurements of the cross-sections probe the validity of the production models. At the LHC, bb production has been studied in inclusive b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X decays [5,6] and semileptonic [7,8] decays. Other measurements, using fully reconstructed B mesons, have also been performed by the LHCb and CMS collaborations [9][10][11][12].",

The total systematic uncertainty is obtained from the sum in quadrature of all contributions. Uncertainties on the signal yields arise from imperfect knowledge of the signal shape, non-resonant background and finite size of the bins. The uncertainty from the signal shape is estimated by comparing the fitted and generated signal yields in simulation. The non-resonant background ratios determined in this analysis are compared with those from measurements with angular fits [28] and the differences are assigned as systematic uncertainties. By varying the p T or y binning, the uncertainty for changing the binning in p T is found to be small while that for y is non-negligible in the low y bin. An uncertainty is assigned due to the procedure of removal of duplicate candidates in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 events. For the other modes this effect is found to be negligible. The uncertainties from the background shape, misidentified B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + background and mass fit range are small.",

The tracking uncertainty includes two components: the first is from the data-simulation difference correction; the second is due to the uncertainty on the hadronic interaction length of the detector used in the simulation. Possible systematic biases in the determination of the hadron identification efficiency are estimated using simulated events and comparing the true efficiency with that obtained by applying the same procedure as for the data. The muon identification uncertainty is estimated by comparing the efficiency in simulation with that measured, on data, using a tag and probe method. The systematic uncertainties due to the uncertainties on the angular distributions of B 0 and B 0 s decays [15,32] are taken into account by simulating the effect of varying the central values of the polarization amplitudes by \u00b11 sigma. In the first p T bin of the B 0 sample, the agreement of the p T distributions between data and simulation is not as good as in the other bins. The discrepancy is assigned as an additional uncertainty for that bin. The vertex fit quality cut uncertainty is estimated from the data to simulation comparison.
