The search uses a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector in 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 , representing essentially the full LHC Run 2 data sample. The analysis is performed in a four-dimensional search region defined in terms of the number of jets, the number of tagged bottom quark jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and the magnitude of the vector sum of jet transverse momenta. No significant excess in the event yield is observed relative to the expected background contributions from standard model processes. Limits on the pair production of gluinos and squarks are obtained in the framework of simplified models for supersymmetric particle production and decay processes. Assuming the lightest supersymmetric particle to be a neutralino, lower limits on the gluino mass as large as 2000 to 2310 GeV are obtained at 95% confidence level, while lower limits on the squark mass as large as 1190 to 1630 GeV are obtained, depending on the production scenario.",

The jets are classified according to whether their properties are consistent with a jet initiated by the production of a bottom quark (b jet), a key experimental signature in many models of new-particle production. The large missing transverse momentum is typically associated with the production of a stable, weakly interacting particle that is not detected by the apparatus. In this analysis, this quantity is inferred from the total momentum of the observed jets in the transverse plane, which should sum to approximately zero if there are no unobserved particles. Signatures of this type have been studied extensively by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. This signature arises frequently in theoretical models based on supersymmetry (SUSY) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] as well as in a broad range of other theories [19][20][21][22][23][24] extending the SM. The analysis uses a sample of pp collision events at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector in 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 . This represents essentially the complete CMS Run 2 data sample and is about four times larger than the 2016 data sample alone, which was used in the previous analysis based on this methodology [8].",

            "text": "The motivation for searches for new physics in the final state with jets and large missing transverse momentum arises from several considerations. Astrophysical observations provide compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, known empirically to be the dominant component of matter in the universe. A weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is one class of candidates for dark matter. However, the SM does not contain such a particle. Within the SM, the Higgs boson presents special theoretical challenges. Assuming that the Higgs boson is a fundamental particle, its spin-0 nature implies that the physical mass of the Higgs boson, as a quantity in the SM, is unstable against corrections from quantum-loop processes. In the absence of extreme fine tuning [25][26][27][28] that would precisely cancel these effects, the Higgs boson mass is generically driven to the cutoff scale of validity of the theory, which could be as high as the Planck scale of quantum gravity. The instability of the Higgs boson mass, and with it, that of the entire electroweak scale (including the W and Z boson masses), is known as the gauge hierarchy problem. This problem has been a major challenge confronting theoretical particle physics for several decades. The discovery by ATLAS and CMS of a Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV has strongly highlighted this puzzle. The concept of \"naturalness,\" [26][27][28], which refers to the degree of fine tuning of parameters, has been discussed extensively as an important, yet difficult to quantify, consideration in assessing theoretical scenarios.",

Supersymmetry relates each SM bosonic field degree of freedom to a corresponding fermionic superpartner field, and vice versa. Each spin J = 1/2 particle in the SM (the quarks and leptons) therefore has a spin J = 0 superpartner, so the SUSY spectrum contains a large number of scalar quarks (squarks, q) and scalar leptons (sleptons, l). The SUSY partners of the SM gauge bosons (J = 1) are referred to as gauginos (J = 1/2). For example, the superpartner of the gluon is a gluino ( g ). The minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [16][17][18] contains five Higgs bosons (J = 0) plus the usual four electroweak gauge bosons (J = 1) of the SM. In the MSSM, the partners of the Higgs and gauge bosons map onto a set of four J = 1/2 higgsinos and four electroweak gauginos. Because",

Single top quark events produced through the s channel, diboson events such as those originating from WW, ZZ, or ZH production (with H a Higgs boson), and rare events such as those from ttW, ttZ, and WWZ production, are generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 at next-to-leading order (NLO) [57], except that WW events in which both W bosons decay leptonically are generated using the powheg v2.0 [58][59][60][61][62] program at NLO. This same powheg generator is used to describe single top quark events produced through the t and tW channels. The detector response is modeled with the Geant4 [63] suite of programs. Normalization of the simulated background samples is performed using the most accurate cross section calculations available [55,61,62,[64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72], which generally correspond to NLO or next-to-NLO (NNLO) precision.",

Simulated samples generated at LO (NLO) with the CUETP8M1 tune use the nnpdf2.3lo (nnpdf2.3nlo) [90] parton distribution function (PDF), while those using the CP2 or CP5 tune use the nnpdf3.1lo (nnpdf3.1nnlo) [91] PDF.

The number of all remaining jets in the event is denoted N ISR jet . A correction factor is applied to simulated tt and signal events so that the N ISR jet distribution agrees with that in data. The correction is found to be unnecessary for tt samples that are generated with the CP5 tune, so it is not applied to those samples.

These photons are referred to as \"nonprompt.\" The contamination of the CR from nonprompt photons, and thus the purity of signal photons in the sample, is evaluated using a binned maximum likelihood fit to the distribution of the photon candidate's charged hadron isolation variable. The fit is based on templates for nonprompt and signal photons. For signal photons, the template is taken from simulation, using the nominal photon selection criteria. For nonprompt photons, three different versions of the template are made: i) from simulation using the nominal criteria; ii) from simulation in a high\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 sideband (defined by inverting the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 selection criterion), where nonprompt photon production is expected to dominate; and iii) from data in this same high-\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 sideband. The arithmetic mean of the three nonprompt templates is used in the fit, with the variation in the results obtained using the three templates individually defining a systematic uncertainty. The purity is determined as a function of H miss T and typically exceeds 90%. In the generation of simulated \u03b3+jets events, photons that are approximately collinear with a parton (\u2206R < 0.4) are removed to improve the fraction of events with well-isolated photons and thus the statistical precision of the sample. A correction denoted F dir is evaluated to account for a bias from this requirement, using simulated events with a looser restriction on the angular separation between the generator-level photons and partons. The corrections are typically less than 10%. A systematic uncertainty in the correction given by 0.30(1 \u2212 F dir ) is determined by evaluating the level of agreement between simulation and data in the distribution of the angular separation between a photon and the nearest jet, and the effect of changing the definition of collinear photons in the simulation.",

We use data to model this background, exploiting knowledge of the jet energy resolution. Briefly, the method employs a set of CR events collected using triggers requiring H T to exceed various thresholds between 200 and 1050 GeV, with no condition on H miss T . Corresponding prescale factors ranging from around 10 000 to 1 are applied, where a prescale factor reduces the recorded event rate relative to the raw trigger rate in order to maintain a manageable data flow. The jet momenta in each CR event are adjusted so that the event has well-balanced jet p T , consistent with the kinematics of a generator-level (i.e., ideally measured) QCD event. This step is called rebalancing. The rebalancing step removes the intrinsic p miss T from the event, thus effectively eliminating the contributions of events like W+jets and Z+jets events that can have genuine p miss T [31]. The jet momenta are then smeared according to the known detector jet p T resolution in order to determine the probability that a given event will populate a given search bin. This latter step is the smear stage. The so-called rebalance and smear (R&S) method was introduced in refs. [31,32] and was further developed in ref. [4].",

To evaluate the uncertainty associated with the renormalization (\u00b5 R ) and factorization (\u00b5 F ) scales, each scale is varied independently by a factor of 2.0 and 0.5 [92][93][94]. The uncertainties associated with \u00b5 R , \u00b5 F , and ISR, integrated over all search bins, typically lie below 0.1%. Nonetheless, they can be as large as the maximum values noted in table 2 if \u2206m \u2248 0, where \u2206m is the difference between the gluino or squark mass and the sum of the masses of the particles into which the gluino or squark decays.

The variations correspond to different signal models and choices for the SUSY particle masses. Results reported as 0.0 correspond to values less than 0.05%. events in these models rarely contain an isolated lepton. Thus, the associated uncertainty is negligible ( 0.1%). The systematic uncertainty in the determination of the integrated luminosity varies between 2.3 and 2.5% [96][97][98], depending on the year of data collection. Systematic uncertainties in the signal predictions associated with the b jet tagging and misidentification efficiencies are also evaluated. These uncertainties do not affect the signal yield but can potentially alter the shape of signal distributions. The systematic uncertainties associated with \u00b5 R , \u00b5 F , ISR, jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, the trigger, statistical precision in the event samples, and H miss T modeling can also affect the shapes of the signal distributions. We account for these potential changes in shape, i.e., migration of events among search bins, in the limit setting procedure described in section 9. Figure 10 presents the observed numbers of events in the 174 search bins. The data are shown in comparison to the stacked pre-fit predictions for the SM backgrounds, where \"pre-fit\" refers to the predictions determined as described in section 7, before constraints from the fitting procedure have been applied. Numerical values are given in appendix A. The uncertainties in the background predictions are mainly from systematic uncertainties in the transfer factors, statistical uncertainties in control sample yields, and systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the search variables. Appendix A lists the overall statistical and systematic uncertainties for the individual background components and for their sum. In addition to the finely segmented search bins of figure 10, we determine the results for 12 aggregate search bins, each representing a potentially interesting signal topology.

Limits are set under the asymptotic approximation [99], with q \u00b5 approximated with an Asimov data set and used in conjunction with the CL s criterion described in refs. [100,101]. We evaluate 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the signal cross sections. The approximate NNLO+NNLL cross section is used to determine corresponding exclusion curves. Before computing these limits, the signal yields are corrected to account for the predicted signal contamination in the CRs from the signal model under consideration. Beyond the observed exclusion limits, we derive expected exclusion limits by evaluating the test statistic using the predicted numbers of background events with their expected Poisson fluctuations.   , gluinos with masses as large as 2180, 2310, 2000, and 2030 GeV, respectively, are excluded. These results significantly extend those of our previous study [8], for which the corresponding limits are 1960, 1950, 1825, and 1800 GeV. Figure 14 shows the corresponding results for the T2tt, T2bb, and T2qq models. Squarks with masses up to 1190, 1220, and 1630 GeV, respectively, are excluded, compared to 960, 990, and 1390 GeV in our previous study [8]. Note that for the T2tt model we do not present cross section upper limits at small values of m are essentially indistinguishable from SM tt events in this region, resulting in large signal contamination of the CRs and rendering the signal event acceptance difficult to model. In addition to the main T2qq model, with four mass-degenerate squark flavors (up, down, strange, and charm), each arising from two different quark spin states, figure 14 (lower) shows the results should only one of these eight states (\"Single q\") be accessible at the LHC. In this case, the upper limit on the squark mass is reduced to 1130 GeV.",

The event yields are measured in 174 nonoverlapping search bins defined in a four-dimensional space of missing transverse momentum (H miss T ), the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta (H T ), the number of jets, and the number of tagged bottom quark jets. The events are required to satisfy H miss T > 300 GeV, H T > 300 GeV, and to have at least two jets with transverse momentum p T > 30 GeV.

For the squark models, each of the produced squarks decays either to a top quark and the \u03c7 0 1 (T2tt model), to a bottom quark and the \u03c7 0 1 (T2bb model), or to a light-flavored quark and the \u03c7 0 1 (T2qq model). Using the predicted cross sections with next-to-leading order plus approximate nextto-leading logarithm accuracy as a reference, gluinos with masses as large as from 2000 to 2310 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the signal model. The corresponding limits on the masses of directly produced squarks range from 1190 for top squarks to 1630 GeV for light-flavored squarks. The results presented here supersede those of ref.
