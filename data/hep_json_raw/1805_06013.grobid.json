            "text": "A search in energetic, high-multiplicity final states for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as black holes, string balls, and electroweak sphalerons, is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016. Standard model backgrounds, dominated by multijet production, are determined from control regions in data without any reliance on simulation. No evidence for excesses above the predicted background is observed. Model-independent 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross section of beyond the standard model signals in these final states are set and further interpreted in terms of limits on semiclassical black hole, string ball, and sphaleron production. In the context of models with large extra dimensions, semiclassical black holes with minimum masses as high as 10.1 TeV and string balls with masses as high as 9.5 TeV are excluded by this search. Results of the first dedicated search for electroweak sphalerons are presented. An upper limit of 0.021 is set at 95% confidence level on the fraction of all quark-quark interactions above the nominal threshold energy of 9 TeV resulting in the sphaleron transition.",

The search described in this paper targets these models of beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics by looking for final states of various inclusive multiplicities featuring energetic objects. Furthermore, since such final states can be used to test a large variety of models, we provide model-independent exclusions on hypothetical signal cross sections. Considering concrete examples of such models, we interpret the results of the search explicitly in models with microscopic semiclassical black holes (BHs) and string balls (SBs), as well as in models with electroweak (EW) sphalerons.

Indeed, the Newton constant, \u223c10 \u221238 GeV \u22122 , which governs the strength of gravity, is much smaller than the Fermi constant, \u223c10 \u22124 GeV \u22122 , which characterizes the strength of EW interactions. Consequently, the Planck scale M Pl \u223c 10 19 GeV, i.e., the energy at which gravity is expected to become strong, is 17 orders of magnitude higher than the EW scale of \u223c100 GeV. With the discovery of the Higgs boson [18][19][20] with a mass [21,22] at the EW scale, the large difference between the two scales poses what is known as the hierarchy problem [23]. This is because in the SM, the Higgs boson mass is not protected against quadratically divergent quantum corrections and -in the absence of fine tuning -is expected to be naturally at the largest energy scale of the theory: the Planck scale. A number of theoretical models have been proposed that attempt to solve the hierarchy problem, such as supersymmetry, technicolor [24], and, more recently, theoretical frameworks based on extra dimensions in space: the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model [13][14][15] and the Randall-Sundrum model [16,17]. In this paper, we look for the manifestation of the ADD model that postulates the existence of n ED \u2265 2 \"large\" (compared to the inverse of the EW energy scale) extra spatial dimensions, compactified on a sphere or a torus, in which only gravity can propagate. This framework allows one to elude the hierarchy problem by explaining the apparent weakness of gravity in the three-dimensional space via the suppression of the fundamentally strong gravitational interaction by the large volume of the extra space. As a result, the fundamental Planck scale, M D , in 3 + n ED dimensions is related to the apparent Planck scale in 3 dimensions via Gauss's law as: M Pl 2 \u223c M D n ED +2 R n ED , where R is the radius of extra dimensions. Since M D could be as low as a few TeV, i.e., relatively close to the EW scale, the hierarchy problem would be alleviated. At high-energy colliders, one of the possible manifestations of the ADD model is the formation of microscopic BHs [25,26] with a production cross section proportional to the squared Schwarzschild radius, given as:",

For example, quantum BHs [28][29][30] are expected to decay before they thermalize, resulting in low-multiplicity final states. Another model of semiclassical BH precursors is the SB model [31], which predicts the formation of a long, jagged string excitation, folded into a \"ball\". The evaporation of an SB is similar to that of a semiclassical BH, except that it takes place at a fixed Hagedorn temperature [32], which depends only on the string scale M S . The formation of an SB occurs once the mass of the object exceeds M S /g S , where g S is the string coupling. As the mass of the SB grows, eventually it will transform into a semiclassical BH, once its mass exceeds",

The baryon number will also change by 3N CS because each quark has an absolute baryon number of 1/3 and there are three colors and three generations of quarks produced. This results in two important relations, which are essential to the phenomenology of sphalerons: \u2206(B + L) = 6N CS and \u2206(B \u2212 L) = 0. The anomaly only exists if there is enough energy to overcome the potential in N CS , which is fixed by the values of the EW couplings. Assuming the state at 125 GeV to be the SM Higgs boson, the precise measurement of its mass [21,22] allowed the determination of these couplings, giving an estimate of the energy required for the sphaleron transitions of E sph \u2248 9 TeV [44,48].",

            "text": "While the E sph threshold is within the reach of the LHC, it was originally thought that the sphaleron transition probability would be significantly suppressed by a large potential barrier. However, in a recent work [48] it has been suggested that the periodic nature of the Chern-Simons potential reduces this suppression at collision energies \u221a\u015d < E sph , removing it completely for \u221a\u015d \u2265 E sph . This argument opens up the possibility of observing an EW sphaleron transition in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC via processes such as: u + u \u2192 e + \u00b5 + \u03c4 + t t b c c s d + X. Fundamentally, the N CS = +1 (\u22121) sphaleron transitions involve 12 (anti)fermions: three (anti)leptons, one from each generation, and nine (anti)quarks, corresponding to three colors and three generations, with the total electric charge and weak isospin of zero. Nevertheless, at the LHC, we consider signatures with 14, 12, or 10 particles produced, that arise from a q + q \u2192 q + q + sphaleron process, where 0, 1, or 2 of the 12 fermions corresponding to the sphaleron transition may \"cancel\" the q or q inherited from the initial state [49,50]. Since between zero and three of the produced particles are neutrinos, and also between zero and three are top quarks, which further decay, the actual multiplicity of the visible final-state particles may vary between 7 and 20 or more. Some of the final-state particles may also be gluons from either initial-or final-state radiation. While the large number of allowed combinations of the 12 (anti)fermions results in over a million unique transitions [51], many of the final states resulting from these transitions would look identical in a typical collider experiment, as no distinction is made between quarks of the first two generations, leading to only a few dozen phenomenologically unique transitions, determined by the charges and types of leptons and the third-generation quarks in the final state. These transitions would lead to characteristic collider signatures, which would have many energetic jets and charged leptons, as well as large missing transverse momentum due to undetected neutrinos.",

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or neighboring bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to correct for the remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3+jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events are used to account for any residual differences in the jet energy scales in data and simulation [57]. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at a jet p T of 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove those potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures. All jets are required to have p T > 70 GeV and be within |\u03b7| < 5. For the leading p T jet in each event, the energy fraction carried by muon candidates failing the standard identification [58] is required to be less than 80%. This requirement removes events where a low-momentum muon is misreconstructed with very high momentum and misidentified as a high-energy jet. We further require the leading jet in an event to have a charged-hadron fraction of less than 0.99 if this jet is found within |\u03b7| < 2.4 [59].",

It has been found empirically, first via simulation-based studies, and then from the analysis of data at low jet multiplicities, that the shape of the S T distribution for the dominant QCD multijet background does not depend on the multiplicity of the final state, above a certain turn-on threshold. This observation reflects the way a parton shower develops via nearly collinear emission, which conserves S T . It allows one to predict the S T spectrum of a multijet final state using low-multiplicity QCD events, e.g., dijet or trijet events. This \"S T invariance\" provides a powerful method of predicting the dominant background for BH production by taking the S T shape from low-multiplicity events, for which the signal contamination is expected to be negligible, and normalizing it to the observed spectrum at high multiplicities at the low end of the S T distribution, where signal contamination is negligible even for large multiplicities of the final-state objects. The method has been also used for other CMS searches, e.g., a search for stealth supersymmetry [68] and a search for multijet resonances [69]. For semiclassical BH signals, we explore different aspects of BH production and decay by simulating various scenarios, including nonrotating BHs (B1,C2), rotating BHs (B2,C1), rotating BHs with mass loss (B3), and rotating BHs with Yoshino-Rychkov bounds [73] JHEP11 2018  For SB signals, two sets of benchmark points are generated with charybdis 2, such that different regimes of the SB production can be explored. For a constant string coupling value g S = 0.2 the string scale M S is varied from 2 to 4 TeV, while at constant M S = 3.6 TeV, g S is varied from 0.2 to 0.4. For all SB samples, n ED = 6 is used.

As discussed in section 4, the central idea of this method is that the shape of the S T distribution for the dominant multijet background is invariant with respect to the final-state object multiplicity N . Consequently, the background shape can be extracted from low-multiplicity spectra and used to describe the background at high multiplicities. The S T value is preserved by the final-state radiation, which is the dominant source of extra jets beyond LO 2 \u2192 2 QCD processes, as long as the additional jets are above the p T threshold used in the definition of S T . At the same time, jets from initialstate radiation (ISR) change the S T value, but because their p T spectrum is steeply falling they typically contribute only a few percent to the S T value and change the multiplicity N by just one unit, for events used in the analysis. Consequently, we extract the background shape from the N = 3 S T spectrum, which already has a contribution from ISR jets, and therefore reproduces the S T shape at higher multiplicities better than the N = 2 spectrum used in earlier analyses.

Some of the functions are monotonously falling with S T by construction; however, some of them contain polynomial terms, such that they are not constrained to have a monotonic behavior. In order to determine the background shape, we fit the N = 3 S T distribution or the N = 4 S T distribution, normalized to the same total event count as the N = 3 distribution, in the range of 2.5-4.3 TeV, where any sizable contributions from BSM physics have been ruled out by earlier versions of this analysis, with all 16 functional forms.

Indeed, since there is a p T threshold on the objects whose transverse energies count toward the S T value, the minimum possible S T value depends on the number of objects in the final state, and therefore the shape invariance for an S T spectrum with N \u2265 N min is only observed above a certain S T threshold, which increases with N min . In order to determine the minimum value of S T for which this invariance holds, we find a plateau in the ratio of the S T spectrum for each inclusive multiplicity to that for N = 3 in simulated multijet events.

These limits can then be translated into limits on the M min BH in a variety of models,  or on any other signals resulting in an energetic, multi-object final state. We start with the limits for the inclusive multiplicities N \u2265 3, 4, which can be used to constrain models resulting in lower multiplicities of the final-state objects. Since part of the data entering these distributions are used to determine the background shape and its uncertainties, the limits are set only for S min T values above the background fit region, i.e., for S T > 4.5 TeV. For other multiplicities, the limits are shown for S T values above the NRs listed in table 3. These limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are shown in figures 6 and 7. When computing the limits, we use systematic uncertainties in the signal acceptance applicable to the specific models discussed in this paper, as documented in section 7. It is reasonable to expect these limits to apply to a large variety of models resulting in multi-object final states dominated by jets. The limits on the product of the cross section and acceptance approach 0.08 fb at high values of S min T .",

Consequently, the exclusion limit on the sphaleron cross section can be converted into a limit on the PEF, defined in section 5.2. Following ref.

The background, dominated by QCD multijet production, is determined solely from low-multiplicity samples in data. Comparing the distribution of the total transverse momentum S T of the finalstate objects in data with that expected from the backgrounds, we set 95% confidence level model-independent upper limits on the product of the production cross section and acceptance for such final states, as a function of the minimum S T for minimum finalstate multiplicities between 3 and 11. These limits reach 0.08 fb at high S T thresholds. By calculating the acceptance values for benchmark black hole, string ball, and sphaleron signal models, we convert these model-independent limits into lower limits on the minimum semiclassical black hole mass and string ball mass. The limits extend as high as 10.1 TeV, thus improving significantly on previous results. We have also set the first experimental upper limit on the electroweak sphaleron pre-exponential factor of 0.021 for the sphaleron transition energy of 9 TeV.",
