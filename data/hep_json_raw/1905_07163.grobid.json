The measurement is carried out in the final state with two charged leptons and two neutrinos, using data collected during 2015 and 2016 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The integrated cross-sections in the total and fiducial phase spaces are measured with an uncertainty of 7% and compared with Standard Model predictions, and differential measurements in the fiducial phase space are reported. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed, and stringent constraints are placed on anomalous couplings corresponding to neutral triple gauge-boson interactions.",

            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM), the production of gauge boson pairs has a profound connection with the non-Abelian nature of the electroweak (EW) theory and with the spontaneous breaking of the EW gauge symmetry. In addition, a broad range of new phenomena beyond the SM (BSM) are predicted to reveal themselves through diboson production. The study of diboson production probes a cornerstone of the EW theory and possible BSM physics scenarios, and it constitutes a salient component of the physics programme at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Among all the diboson processes, the production of two on-shell Z bosons has the smallest cross-section, but is nevertheless quite competitive for measurements and searches, because of its generally good signal-to-background ratio for the fully leptonic decay channels. For instance, the ZZ process is a leading channel to search for anomalous neutral triple-gauge-boson couplings (aTGCs) [1] and to study the off-shell production of the Higgs boson [2,3].  Figure 1.

The gluon fusion process (ggZZ) includes two sub-processes, one with a fermion loop and the other involving a virtual Higgs boson. Although the ggZZ process only appears at O(\u03b1 2 S ), it nevertheless has a non-negligible contribution of O(10%) to the total ZZ production rate due to the large gluon flux at the LHC. The s-channel production is forbidden at the lowest order; however, the neutral TGCs can still acquire small values of O(10 \u22124 ) in the SM, due to the correction with a fermion loop [5].

The remaining 40% W Z contribution is related to the W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decay with subsequent hadronic decays of the \u03c4 -lepton. Another important background comes from the processes that genuinely produce the \u03bd\u03bd final state but contain a lepton pair not originating directly from a Z-boson decay. This background, referred to as the non-resonant-background, includes W W , top-quark (tt and W t), and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 production. The production of a Z boson in association with jet(s) (Z + jets) also constitutes a potentially large background source. The Z + jets events with large \"fake\" E miss T arise from heavy-flavour hadron decays in the accompanying jet(s), from jet mismeasurements in certain regions of the detector, and from the measurement resolution itself, owing to the additional pp collisions in the same or neighbouring proton bunch crossings (pile-up). The ZZ \u2192 4 process yields a small contribution when one lepton pair misses detection, and it is considered as a background in this measurement. Finally, minor background contributions are expected from three-boson production (V V V with V = W or Z) and production of tt accompanied by one or two vector bosons (ttV ).",

Since no significant deviations from the SM are observed, upper limits are placed on the aTGC parameters [1], which typically manifest themselves as a signal excess growing rapidly as the partonic centre-of-mass energy ( \u221a\u015d ) increases. In this analysis, aTGCs are searched for using the p T spectrum in the fiducial region, motivated by the fact that p T is correlated with \u221a\u015d and has a good experimental resolution.",

The inner-detector system (ID) is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and usually provides four measurements per track. The pixel detector is followed by a silicon microstrip tracker which usually provides four measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction and improved momentum measurements up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The transition radiation tracker also provides electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 30 hits in total) above a high-energy threshold designed for optimal electron-pion separation.",

The interference between the W W and ZZ processes in the \u03bd\u03bd final state was found to be negligible [16] and was therefore not considered in this analysis. Both the tt and W t events were simulated at NLO in QCD with Powheg-Box v2 [38,39] and interfaced to Pythia6.428 [40], and the production cross-sections were corrected to NNLO QCD precision [41,42]. Sherpa2.2.1 with the NNLO NNPDF3.0 PDF was used to model the Z + jets process. The production cross-section for the Z + jets process was calculated with NNLO QCD precision, while the simulation has NLO QCD precision for events with zero, one and two partons, and provided a LO QCD description for events with three to five partons. The rare V V V background, consisting of W W W , W W Z, W ZZ and ZZZ processes, was modelled with Sherpa2.1.1 with NLO QCD precision. MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [43] interfaced to Pythia8.186 was used to generate the ttV background events that account for ttW , ttZ and ttW W production processes. The ttV process was calculated at LO QCD accuracy, and its production cross-section was corrected to NLO QCD precision [43]. Generated events were then processed through the ATLAS detector simulation [44] based on GEANT4 [45] to emulate the response of the detector to the final-state particles. Pile-up was simulated with Pythia8.186 using the A2 tune [46] and overlaid on simulated events to mimic the real collision environment. The distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing in the simulation was weighted to reflect that in data. Simulated events were processed with the same reconstruction algorithms as for the data. Furthermore, the lepton momentum scale and resolution, and the lepton reconstruction, identification, isolation and trigger efficiencies in the simulation were corrected to match those measured in data.",

The variable V T /S T was found to be less sensitive to jet experimental uncertainties than similar variables such as E miss T /S T . To further reduce the impact of jet energy scale uncertainties, the calculation of V T and S T uses \"hard jets\" which are required to have p T > 25 GeV for the central region (|\u03b7| < 2.4) and p T > 40 GeV for the forward region (2.4 < |\u03b7| < 4.5). The E miss T cut suppresses the Z + jets contamination by many orders of magnitude, and the residual Z + jets events, which have large fake E miss T , are further suppressed by the V T /S T requirement. As the consequence of the combined E miss T and V T /S T requirement, the Z + jets process only constitutes a small fraction of the total background after the full selection.",

The PDF uncertainty is calculated as the 68% confidence-level eigenvector uncertainty [26] of the nominal PDF used in the simulation. The uncertainty due to the QCD calculation, also referred to as the \"scale\" uncertainty, covers the variations of predictions from changing the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales. The QCD scales are varied independently by factors ranging from one half to two, which in total yields seven different scale choices including the nominal one. The UEPS uncertainty is taken as the difference in the predictions between the Herwig++ and the default showering programs. The fractional theoretical uncertainty in A ZZ for the qqZZ process is about 1.8%, while the overall uncertainties in the cross-section predictions in the total and fiducial phase spaces are about 3% and 5%, respectively. The Sherpa generator is used to cross-check the nominal predictions, and the A ZZ factors from Powheg and Sherpa are consistent with each other within the uncertainty. The C ZZ predictions from the two generators are found to be consistent within the statistical uncertainty of 1%, and in this measurement, the theoretical uncertainty in C ZZ is neglected.",

[69]. The unfolding process takes into account fiducial corrections (correcting for events outside the fiducial phase space but passing the detector-level selections), bin-to-bin migrations due to detector resolution, and detector inefficiencies. An optimal number of two iterations is used for this analysis, as a balance between the size of the statistical uncertainty in the measurement and residual biases from the method. The residual bias is in almost all bins below 1%, as estimated by comparing the results obtained using different prior distributions (constant, expected, observed) in the unfolding process. The experimental uncertainties for the measurement results are evaluated by varying the response matrices for the unfolding according to the \u00b11\u03c3 effects of each uncertainty source, and by comparing the resulting unfolded results with the nominal one. The background uncertainties are considered at the stage of the background subtraction. The statistical uncertainty of the data is estimated by repeating the unfolding procedure with 2000 - sets of pseudo-data and then taking the root mean square of the deviations of the resulting spectra from the data spectrum. The response matrices are also subject to the statistical uncertainty of the simulated samples, which is estimated using a similar approach. Figures 6 and 7 present the measured differential cross-sections for the eight observables of interest defined in section 1. The binning for each variable is chosen to minimise the bin-to-bin migrations while preserving a sufficient number of events per bin. The N jets spectrum is measured only for hard jets as defined in section 4, and the p jet1 T distribution is obtained in the fiducial phase space of events containing at least one hard jet. The predictions from Powheg+gg2vv and Sherpa are also shown in figures 6 and 7, and are found to be in agreement with the measurements within uncertainties. The electroweak production of ZZ associated with two jets is not taken into account in the predictions due to its negligible contribution. The differential measurements are largely dominated by the statistical uncertainty on the data, but the systematic uncertainties contribute significantly in certain regions of phase space. As an example, the uncertainties from the various sources for the differential measurement of the p T distribution are listed in table 9.",

The parameterisation for the qqZZ process is derived from simulation as described in section 3, while the impact of the aTGCs is neglected for the ggZZ process. Since the sensitivity to possible aTGCs lies in the high-p T region, only the bins with p T > 150 GeV are considered in the search. Figure 8 compares the measured p T spectrum in this region of phase space to the SM prediction alone and to the SM prediction augmented with aTGCs corresponding to different values of the coupling parameters described above. The highest-p T bins are required to contain a minimum of ten observed events at the detector level, which arises from the fact that the limits on aTGCs derived from the unfolded distribution rely on a Gaussian approximation for the statistical fluctuations from the data. The total uncertainty in the measured cross-section in the last bin is about 40%, while the corresponding SM prediction has an uncertainty of 15%. The sensitivity to aTGCs is thus still limited by the statistical uncertainty of the data.",

The fiducial cross-section of the combined ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels is measured to be \u03c3 fid ZZ\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd = 25.4 \u00b1 1.4 (stat) \u00b1 0.9 (syst) \u00b1 0.5 (lumi) fb, in agreement with the SM prediction of 22.4 \u00b1 1.3 fb. The integrated cross-sections in the total and fiducial phase spaces are measured with a total uncertainty of 7%, which is significantly better than the previous measurement using the 8 TeV data. The measured cross-sections are slightly larger than the SM predictions, but the difference is not significant considering the measurement and prediction uncertainties. Differential cross-sections are reported for eight different kinematic variables in the fiducial phase space, and no significant deviation from the expectations is found. The measured p T spectrum in the fiducial phase space is used to set limits on aTGCs, and the obtained 95% confidence intervals for the aTGC parameters are more stringent than those derived from the 4 channel.  have received support from BCKDF, CANARIE, CRC and Compute Canada, Canada; COST, ERC, ERDF, Horizon 2020, and Marie Sk lodowska-Curie Actions, European Union; Investissements d' Avenir Labex and Idex, ANR, France; DFG and AvH Foundation, Germany; Herakleitos, Thales and Aristeia programmes co-financed by EU-ESF and the Greek NSRF, Greece; BSF-NSF and GIF, Israel; CERCA Programme Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain; The Royal Society and Leverhulme Trust, United Kingdom.",
