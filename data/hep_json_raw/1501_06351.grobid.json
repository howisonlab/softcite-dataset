            "text": "Many exotic charmonium-like states are observed in the mass region above the DD threshold. Decays of B mesons provide a fruitful opportunity to study these states and to find new ones. For example, the state X(3872) was first observed by Belle in exclusive B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 decays [1] that was later confirmed by CDF [2], D\u00d8 [3] and BaBar [4]. It was also observed in the LHCb experiment [5,6] in pp collisions and B decays. The X(3872) mass is close to the m D 0 + mD * 0 threshold, which engendered a hypothesis that this state may be a D 0D * 0 molecule [7]. The observation of the decay X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 by BaBar [8] and Belle [9] established the charged parity of X(3872) to be positive. Angular analysis of the X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay by LHCb [6] determined all its quantum numbers: J P C = 1 ++ . If X(3872) is indeed a D 0D * 0 molecule, there can exist other \"X(3872)-like\" molecular states with different quantum numbers. Some may reveal themselves in the decays to final states containing the \u03b7 c meson. For example, a D 0D * 0 \u2212D 0 D * 0 combination (denoted hereinafter by X 1 (3872)) with quantum numbers J P C = 1 +\u2212 would have a mass around 3.872 GeV/c 2 and would decay to \u03b7 c \u03c1 and \u03b7 c \u03c9. Combinations of D 0D0 +D 0 D 0 , denoted by X(3730), and D * 0D * 0 +D * 0 D * 0 , denoted by X(4014), with quantum numbers J P C = 0 ++ would decay to \u03b7 c \u03b7 and \u03b7 c \u03c0 0 . The mass of the X(3730) state would be around 2m D 0 = 3.730 GeV/c 2 while that of the X(4014) state would be near 2m D * 0 = 4.014 GeV/c 2 .",

The Belle detector [28] (also see detector section in [29]) is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC) for charged particle tracking and specific ionization measurement (dE/dx), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an array of 8736 CsI(Tl) crystals for electromagnetic calorimetry located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux return yoke located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and identify muons. We use a GEANT3-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine its acceptance [30].",
