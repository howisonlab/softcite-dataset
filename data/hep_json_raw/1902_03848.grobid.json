            "text": "Abstract Neutrino neutral-current (NC) induced single photon production is a subleading order process for accelerator-based neutrino beam experiments including T2K. It is, however, an important process to understand because it is a background for electron (anti)neutrino appearance oscillation experiments. Here, we performed the first search of this process below 1 GeV using the finegrained detector at the T2K ND280 off-axis near detector. By reconstructing single photon kinematics from electron-positron pairs, we achieved 95% pure gamma ray sample from 5.738 10 20 protons-on-targets neutrino mode data. We do not find positive evidence of NC induced single photon production in this sample. We set the model-dependent upper limit on the cross-section for this process, at 0.114 10 38 cm 2 (90% C.L.) per nucleon, using the J-PARC off-axis neutrino beam with an average energy of E 0.6 n \u27e8 \u27e9 GeV. This is the first limit on this process below 1\uf0a0GeV which is important for current and future oscillation experiments looking for electron neutrino appearance oscillation signals.",

            "text": "Measurements of neutrino oscillation provide an emerging picture of the neutrino Standard Model (\u03bdSM). A series of high precision neutrino oscillation measurements by T2K [1][2][3][4][5] and others [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] are consistent with three massive neutrinos in the Standard Model (SM) [16]. The neutrino oscillation parameters are free parameters in the lepton mixing matrix of the \u03bdSM that are determined from measurements. Among them, the Dirac CP phase, CP d , is a key parameter to measure since it may shed light on the mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe [17]. Recently T2K reported the observation of 89 e n candidate events in e n n \uf0ae m (\u03bd e appearance), and 7 e n candidate events in e n n \uf0ae m\u00af( e n appearance) [5]. These observations show that CP conserving values, 0 CP d = and \u03c0, fall outside the 2s confidence intervals. Future experiments, Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) [18] and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [19] will use higher intensity beams and more massive detectors to make precision measurements of oscillation with 1, 000 \uf04f( )\u03bd e and e n candidate events. The \u03bd e and e n appearance channels can also be used to search for unexpected physics processes. The MiniBooNE experiment reports e e n n (\u00af) appearance oscillation candidate signals from n m (n m ) dominant beam [20].

In these experiments, single isolated electromagnetic showers are signals of e e n n (\u00af) appearance in oscillations from n m (n m ) dominant beams. Photons induced by n m (n m ) NC interactions could mimic these signal events. There are two relevant backgrounds, NC induced single \u03c0 0 production (NC1\u03c0 0 ) and NC induced single photon production (NC1\u03b3). NC1\u03c0 0 can be a significant background if one of two gamma rays fails to be detected. Recent analysis at T2K [4] shows that this background can be rejected effectively by introducing a likelihood-based reconstruction technique at the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) far detector [2]. Similarly, liquid argon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors [23] have achieved comparable photon identification from neutrino-produced s 0 p [24,25]. NC1\u03b3 is a rare process which has been identified as an important background process in e e n n (\u00af) appearance oscillation experiments. This process has significant theoretical uncertainties [26][27][28][29]. A single photon with energy of order 100 MeV from NC1\u03b3 may be mistaken for the e e n n (\u00af) appearance signal. Figure 1 shows diagrams associated with the NC1\u03b3 process. If the NC1\u03b3 process is related to a radiative decay of \u0394-resonance, a simple estimate of the cross-section based on a ratio of the branching ratios (",

            "text": "gives the crosssection of NC1\u03b3 of \u223c10 \u221241 cm 2 per nucleon around the T2K beam energy. There was some interest in studying this process in the past [30], motivated by the low energy photon excess observed in the Gargamelle experiment [31]. One interpretation of the MiniBooNE excesses is NC1\u03b3 production. Recently, a series of new calculations of NC1\u03b3 have been published. These models include contributions from previously ignored anomaly mediated photon production [32,33], a calculation based on the chiral effective field theory [34][35][36], a model including higher resonance contributions and nuclear media effect [37], and others [38][39][40]. These new calculations are consistent with the NC1\u03b3 background simulation used by MiniBooNE [41][42][43]. It has also been suggested that new physics processes could make NC1\u03b3-like final states which potentially explain MiniBooNE excesses, including heavy neutrino radiative decay models [44][45][46][47][48] and massive neutral boson decay models [49][50][51]. Some constraints on these models have been realized [52]. For Hyper-K, the NC1\u03b3 process is predicted to produce approximately 10% of the background. However, given the 100% theoretical uncertainties assigned to NC1\u03b3 in both neutrino and antineutrino modes, and the absence of measurements below 1\uf0a0GeV, this is a source of systematic uncertainty that should be better understood.",

ND280 is a tracker detector which consists of several sub-detectors, including plastic scintillator tracker with radiator \u03c0 0 -detector (P0D) [57], plastic scintillator tracker fine-grained detectors (FGDs) [58], gas TPC [59], electromagnetic calorimeters (ECal) [60], and a side muon range detector [61]. The sub-detectors, going downstream in the neutrino flux are the P0D, followed by two FGDs and three TPCs which alternate to make the tracking region of ND280. The P0D and the FGDs provide target mass and vertex measurements, and the subsequent TPCs provide tracking measurements. All sub-detectors are immersed in a 0.2 T dipole magnetic field, and track measurements in the TPCs provide charge and momentum measurements of charged particles. Figure 2 is an event display of an NC1\u03b3 candidate event. The neutrino interaction is identified in the first FGD (FGD1), and subsequent TPC2 measures electron and positron tracks. A rectangular region 174.9 cm (x) 174.9 cm (y) 54.2 cm (z) in the FGD1 is defined to be the fiducial volume of this analysis where the z-axis is the direction of the beam, the y-axis points upward, and the x-axis is chosen to complete the right-hand Cartesian coordinate. The target material is polystyrene CH 2 and the number of target nucleons is 5. 54 10 29 with 0.6% error. The detector Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is based on GEANT4 [62], and neutrino interactions are simulated by the NEUT event generator version 5.3.2 [5]. Note, the normalization of the NC1\u03b3 model used in NEUT v.5.3.2 was found to be roughly 50% lower than more recent calculations [63,64], however, it does not affect our analysis result.",

            "text": "In this article, we described the search for NC1\u03b3 process below 1\uf0a0GeV, using the T2K offaxis near detector. Although we found 39 NC1\u03b3 candidate events, these events are consistent with predicted background events and we set the first limit on the NC1\u03b3 cross-section below 1\uf0a0GeV, at 0.114 10 38 <\u00b4cm 2 (90% C.L.). An excellent tracking system allows to construct a 95% pure photon sample, however, there are two main factors which limit our analysis. First, the analysis does not use an internal constraint on NC\u03c0 0 production rate, and we rely on external data to understand NC\u03c0 0 production rate uncertainties. Ideally, we should utilize a simultaneous measurement of photons and s 0 p so that the systematics of \u03c0 0 production rate can be constrained. NC\u03c0 0 production has been measured in P0D [73], and such measurement in FGD has been developed [74]. Second, an internal constraint for external background is not available, and we rely on mainly simulation to estimate the incoming photon background. Such background could be internally measured if the detector had a large active veto region, and similarly could be suppressed if the detector had less dead material between the active veto and the fiducial volume. This may be achieved by the P0D where larger fiducial volume than FGDs can reduce external background. New active detectors developed for T2K, such as WAGASCI [75] may overcome these problems and set a better limit by utilizing better tracking with relatively larger fiducial volume. Some current neutrino experiments, such as MINERvA [76], MicroBooNE [23], SBND and ICARUS [77] have larger fiducial volumes with less inactive detector regions, and these experiments have better control for both internal and external backgrounds, and they also have the chance to make the first measurement of NC1\u03b3 process.",

The mean free path i l of photons for arbitrary material i can be written as [78] r where we use the fine structure constant a, classical electron radius r e , atomic density D atom , atomic number Z, Tsai's radiation length L rad and L rad \u00a2 with a high order correction f (Z) [79]. Using equation (A.4), one can modify the density (hence the mass) and the composition of the material to change the mean free path. The mass variations of materials, where a typical systematic uncertainty is of the order of a few %, are derived from detector design reports [57][58][59][60][61] and CC inclusive data leaving signals at the outer layers of the fiducial volume of FGD1. We apply this for photons coming from all directions, traverse different sub-detectors and materials, to find the distribution of external background variations. The shape of the weights for photons traversing a large distance of material is skewed towards high number of events. The skew reflects that a small change in the density of materials causes large errors in the number of photons converted in the fiducial volume. Note that the asymmetry of the errors was taken into account for the analysis and this is shown in the third row of table 1.",
