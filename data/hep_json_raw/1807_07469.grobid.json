The strangeness enhancement is investigated by measuring the evolution with multiplicity of single-strange and multi-strange baryon production relative to non-strange particles. A smooth increase of strange particle yields relative to the non-strange ones with event multiplicity has been observed in such systems. We report the latest results on multiplicity dependence of strange and multi-strange hadron production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV with ALICE. We also presented recent measurements of mesonic and baryonic resonances in small collision systems like pp and p-Pb at \u221a s NN = 13 and 8.16 TeV, respectively. The multiplicity dependent studies in pp and p-Pb collisions have been used to investigate how the hadronic scattering processes affect measured resonance yields and to better understand the interplay between canonical suppression and strangeness enhancement. The measurement of the \u03c6(1020) meson as a function of multiplicity provides crucial constraints in this context.",

            "text": "The enhancement of strangeness production in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions (A-A) relative to the production in proton-proton (pp) collisions has historically been proposed as one of the signatures of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation [1]. Experimentally, this was first observed in Pb-Pb collisions at SPS [2] and subsequently at RHIC [3] and LHC [4]. This enhancement in A-A collisions has also been explained as a suppression of strangeness production in reference samples like pp and p-Pb due to the lack of phase space for strange quark creation in small systems [5]. Recently, the ALICE Collaboration has observed that the yields of strange hadrons are enhanced relative to non-strange hadrons in high multiplicity pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and the strangeness enhancement in high multiplicity pp collisions reaches the values observed in p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions [6]. The strength of this enhancement increases with increasing strange quark content of the hadron. It was observed that the enhancement of strangeness production in small systems is due to the strangeness content rather than mass or a meson-baryon effect. As the net strangeness of \u03c6-meson is zero, it is interesting to study how the \u03c6-meson behaves in the strangeness enhancement picture. It has been observed that by comparing similar event multiplicity and by changing the colliding system (pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb) the relative particles abundances are not modified [7]. By comparing the results from the pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV to those at lower energies, the center-of-mass energy dependence of hadrochemistry can be isolated. It is also interesting to measure the short-lived resonance particles like K * 0 (\u03c4 \u223c 4.2 fm/c) and \u03c6 (\u03c4 \u223c 46.3 fm/c). These hadrons may decay in a phase between chemical and kinetic freeze-out. As a result, the decay daughters may re-scatter, leading to a reduction in the measurable resonance yields. Resonances may also be regenerated due to pseudo-elastic scattering of hadrons through a resonance state, which enhances their production [8]. The centrality or multiplicity dependent suppression of the K * 0 /K ratio has been observed in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions [9,10]. So, it is most important to see if such an effect can be observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions, which might be an indication for a hadronic phase with non-zero lifetime. In this work, we present the multiplicity dependence of resonance, strange and multi-strange hadron production in pp and p-Pb collisions measured with the ALICE detector at \u221a s NN = 13 and 8.16 TeV, respectively.",

The multiplicity classes are defined based on percentiles of the distribution of the summed amplitudes measured in the V0 detectors (V0A+V0C) [12]. The measurements of resonance, strange and multi-strange hadron production are performed at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5 in pp collisions and 0 < y cm < 0.5 in p-Pb collisions) as a function of the charged particle density, which is also measured at mid-rapidity for each multiplicity class.

In the invariant-mass method one needs to estimate the combinatorial background, which is evaluated by using an event-mixing technique for resonances. For strange and multistrange hadrons, a set of topological cuts is applied to eliminate the candidates which do not fit the expected decay topology. After the background subtraction the raw yields are extracted from the signal distribution to be then corrected for detector acceptance, tracking efficiency and branching ratio. The first two corrections were determined by means of Monte Carlo simulations of the ALICE detector response.  for each multiplicity event class are determined by integrating the p T spectra in the measured range and by      p-Pb collisons, which might be due to re-scattering. As re-scattering is important at low p T , we looked into the p T differential ratios K * 0 /K 0 S and \u03c6/K 0 S , which are shown in Fig. 4 for two extreme multiplicity classes, K * 0 /K 0 S in the left panel and \u03c6/K 0 S in the right panel. In the bottom panels the ratios of high to low multiplicity classes are shown. Both ratios increase at low p T and saturate for p T > 3 GeV/c. Depletion in the ratios for high multiplicity at low p T is observed. From the bottom panels it is clear that the K * 0 /K 0 S ratio is more suppressed compared to \u03c6/K 0 S for p T < 2 GeV/c. This observation is consistent with a re-scattering effect in high multiplicity pp collisions. suggests that the \u03c6 behaves like a particle with effective strangeness between 1 and 2, similar to K and \u039e. This is important, since \u03c6 is not subject to canonical suppression, whereas K and \u039e should be canonically suppressed.",
