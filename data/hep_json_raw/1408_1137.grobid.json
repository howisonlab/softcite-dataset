In extensions of the SM, new particles can significantly change the branching fractions and angular distributions of the observed final-state particles. Due to their sensitivity to effects beyond the SM, semileptonic B decays involving FCNC transitions are currently under intense study at the LHCb experiment [1][2][3][4].",

Its composition was studied by the Belle collaboration for the tree-level decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [5], where the K 1 (1270) + meson was found to have a prominent contribution. The K 1 (1270) + and the K 1 (1400) + mesons are the mass eigenstates that result from mixing of the P -wave axial vector mesons 3 P 1 (K 1A ) and 1 P 1 (K 1B ) with the mixing angle \u03b8 K 1 [6]. The value of \u03b8 K 1 is either about \u221233 \u2022 or \u221257 \u2022 [6][7][8][9][10][11] with most recent determinations favouring the former [8][9][10][11]. The decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6K + was first observed by the CLEO collaboration [12] and recently investigated in the search for the X(4140) [13][14][15][16].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp interaction vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the the component of p transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [19]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [20]. The trigger [21] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The signal component (shaded light blue) is modelled by the sum of two Gaussian functions, each with a power-law tail at low mass. The background component (shaded dark blue) is modelled by an exponential function. In the q 2 ranges 4.30 < q 2 < 8.68 GeV 2 /c 4 , 10.09 < q 2 < 12.86 GeV 2 /c 4 , and 14.18 < q 2 < 19.00 GeV 2 /c 4 , scaling factors are applied to account for the vetoes of the radiative tails of the charmonium resonances, resulting in steps in the background mass shape.
