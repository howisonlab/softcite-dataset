The aim of this work is to search for monochromatic axions with an energy of 9.4 keV emitted in the M1 transition in the 83 Kr nuclei in the Sun [1]. Axions on the Earth can be detected in the inverse reaction of resonance absorption by detecting particles (\u03b3-and X-ray photons, as well as conversion and Auger electrons) appearing at the decay of an excited nuclear level. The probability of the emission and subsequent absorption of axions depends only on the coupling constant with nucleons, which is minimally model dependent and is proportional to axionnucleon coupling constant (g AN ) 4 .",
