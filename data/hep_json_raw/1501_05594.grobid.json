From lattice QCD, it is predicted that hadronic matter under extreme conditions of high temperature and density changes its properties, in this state the fundamental degrees of freedom are given by quarks and gluons [1]. The phase transition occurs at a critical (crossover) temperature between 143-171 MeV [2,3,4,5,6,7]. The experimental access to explore and test the QCD phase diagram and to address the fundamental question of hadron confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is via ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.",

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the only experiment at the LHC designed for this purpose [9].

For the hot nuclear matter effects to be studied, analyses of pp and p-Pb data were also performed. Unexpectedly, these data revealed intriguing effects which are not well understood.

That is why ALICE is an experiment specialized in PID from hundreds of MeV/c up to tens of GeV/c. The central barrel of ALICE is placed inside a large solenoidal magnet which provides a magnetic field of 0.5 T. It is dedicated to detect hadrons, electrons, and photons produced at mid-pseudorapidity, |\u03b7| <0.8. It comprises an Inner Tracking System (ITS) of high-resolution silicon detectors, a cylindrical Time-Projection Chamber (TPC), and particle identification arrays of Transition-Radiation Detectors (TRD) and of  Time-Of-Flight (TOF) counters. Additional central subsystems, not-covering full azimuth, are a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector for High-Momentum Particle IDentification (HMPID), and two electromagnetic calorimeters: a high-resolution PHOton Spectrometer (PHOS) and a larger-acceptance ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). The muon arm detects muons emitted within 2.5 < \u03b7 < 4 and consists of a complex arrangement of absorbers, a dipole magnet, five pairs of tracking chambers, and two trigger stations. Several smaller detectors (VZERO, TZERO, FMD, ZDC, and PMD) for triggering, multiplicity measurements and centrality determination are installed in the forward region.",

To learn about the early state of the system, low p T (< 2.2 GeV/c) direct photons are used. A temperature of 304 MeV has been measured for the 0-40% Pb \u2212 Pb collisions [10]. Hence, the system at the LHC is hotter than that produced at RHIC, where an early temperature of 221 MeV was measured for the 0-20% Au-Au collisions. The system created at the LHC is also denser, the average multiplicity per number of participant is two times that measured at RHIC [11]. Also interesting is the fact that the same centrality dependence is found at RHIC and LHC.",

However, larger deviations are observed for protons and K * , for the latter, this is not a surprise since its mean lifetime is comparable to that for the fireball (\u224810 fm/c) [13].

            "text": "The particle ratios as a function of p T are shown in Fig. 3 for pp and the most central Pb\u2212Pb collisions. The proton-to-pion ratio increases from \u2248 0.38 to \u2248 0.8 going from peripheral (60-80%) to central (0-5%) Pb\u2212Pb collisions at p T \u2248 3 GeV/c, then decreases to the value measured for vacuum fragmentation (pp collisions) for p T > 10 GeV/c. The result obtained for the most central collisions is similar to that measured at RHIC [24,25]. The kaon-to-pion ratio also exhibits a bump around p T = 3 GeV/c, this effect is not predicted by quark recombination suggesting that the actual enhancement of the baryon-to-meson ratio is not anomalous and instead it is most likely driven by hydrodynamical flow. This picture is tested by comparing the shapes of the p T distributions of \u03c6-meson and protons. The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that for central Pb\u2212Pb collisions the shapes of the ratios to pions are the same. Also shown is the evolution with collision centrality of the \u03c6-meson yield normalized to that for protons as a function of p T .",

At high multiplicity the low p T parts of the spectra are better described by models which incorporate hydro [28]. Also intriguing is the fact that a similar effect has been observed in pp collisions, in that case the multiplicity was determined at mid-rapidity. The feature is also present in Pythia 8 tune 4C [30], this behavior is a consequence of the interactions among final partons coming from independent semi-hard scatterings which increases with increasing number of multi-parton interactions (MPI) [31]. One therefore cannot rule out alternative explanations, but interestingly, it illustrates that likely there is a strong coupling of this phenomenon to the underlying event also in pp collisions.",

            "text": "The evolution of the spectral shapes with multiplicity is studied using the the blast-wave analysis. Figure 6 (left) shows that a qualitatively similar behavior for T kin vs. \u03b2 T is obtained for the three systems (pp, p-Pb and Pb\u2212Pb) even in pp events simulated with Pythia 8. To study the effect on the p T spectra directly, the protonto-pion ratio was constructed, the results for p-Pb and Pb\u2212Pb collisions are presented in Fig. 6 (right) for two extreme multiplicity intervals. For p T below (above) 2 GeV/c the ratios exhibit a depletion (enhancement) going from low to high multiplicity. The highest (lowest) multiplicity intervals give ratios which reach maxima at p T \u2248 3 GeV/c amounting to \u22480.4 and \u2248 0.8 (\u2248 0.28 and \u2248 0.38) in p-Pb and Pb\u2212Pb collisions, respectively. Above 3 GeV/c, the ratios start to decrease down to \u2248 0.1 at p T \u2248 10 GeV/c, which according to [12] corresponds to the value measured for vacuum fragmentation (pp collisions). Figure 7 shows the average p T for K * 0 , protons and \u03c6mesons as a function of the system size. The measurements were performed for pp, p-Pb and Pb\u2212Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, respectively. The p T for MB pp collisions fits well with the behavior of the p-Pb results. Actually, for inclusive charged particles a similar effect is seen, namely, the average p T for pp and p-Pb data agree when the event multiplicity (|\u03b7| <0.3) is below \u223c 20, and for higher multiplicities the strongest rise of p T is observed for pp data [32]. For Pb \u2212 Pb collisions the rise of p T with the event multiplicity is weaker than for small systems. This could indicate that to reach the high multiplicity in small systems, the partonic processes need to be harder. Another interesting result is shown in Fig. 8, where the multiplicity dependence of the proton-to-\u03c6 ratio as a function of p T is shown. The p-Pb results are compared to the ratios measured in peripheral and central Pb\u2212Pb collisions. The ratio for high multiplicity p-Pb events exhibits a flattening for p T below 1.5 GeV/c, while for higher p T the ratio decreases in the same amount as those measured for low multiplicity p-Pb and the most peripheral Pb\u2212Pb collisions. The behavior of the ratio in high multiplicity p-Pb data could be interpreted as a hint of the onset of collective behavior.",

The results are reported in this paper [27]. To understand the potential role of MPI in p-Pb collisions the minijet production as a function of the event multiplicity was studied. In pp data this analysis was successfully applied. Through the measurement of the so-called number of uncorrelated seeds, which in Pythia are directly related with the number of MPIs, it was observed a deviation of this quantity with respect to the linear behavior, this was interpreted as an indication of the limitation of the number of MPIs to produce high multiplicity events [33].

In particular, a measurement of elliptic flow with identified particles shows a clear mass ordering for light and strange hadrons for p T <2.5 GeV/c. Spectra and v 2 measurements of the \u03c6 meson suggests that the mass (and not the number of constituent quarks) drives the spectral shape and the size of the elliptic flow in central collisions for p T <4 GeV/c. While there are several observables which are approximately consistent with a description of p-Pb collisions as incoherent superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions at high p T , some measurements hint to novel effects at low p T which are potentially of collective origin. These findings still need to be reconciled theoretically and promise that p-Pb collisions will continue to be a very exciting field in the future.  ",
