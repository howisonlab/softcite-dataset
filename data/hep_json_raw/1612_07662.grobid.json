Direct dark-matter searches aim at an observation of dark-matter particles interacting within detectors. The focus of several such searches is on interactions with nuclei as provided e.g. by weakly interacting massive particles. However, there is a variety of dark-matter candidates favoring interactions with electrons rather than with nuclei. One example are dark photons, i.e., long-lived vector particles with a kinetic mixing to standard-model photons. In this work we present constraints on this kinetic mixing based on data from CRESST-II Phase 2 corresponding to an exposure before cuts of 52 kg-days. These constraints improve the existing ones for dark-photon masses between 0.3 and 0.7 keV/c 2 .",

Due to the short range of electrons in matter all energy is deposited within the detectors.

The so-called phonon detector based on a scintillating CaWO 4 crystal with a mass of 306 g measures the phonons generated by particle interactions within the crystal. The additional light detector is based on a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) disc and measures the scintillation light emitted by the CaWO 4 crystal. Both detectors are surrounded by a scintillating and reflective housing to increase the light-collection efficiency. In addition, the scintillation light generated within the housing can be used for background suppression. Figure 2 depicts the data analyzed for this work after all cuts. The exposure before cuts is 52 kg-days. The events above the clearly visible electron-recoil band are called excess-light events. The origin of these events is not fully understood. However, a likely explanation are \u03b2 particles penetrating the detector housing before hitting the CaWO 4 crystal. Since the detector housing is also scintillating, such events would generate additional scintillation light resulting in a higher detected light-energy than expected for \u03b2 particles Fig. 2 The light energy E l , i.e., the scintillation light detected by the light detector, plotted against the phonon energy E p . The electron-recoil band, where dark-photon events and most of the background events are expected, is clearly visible. The most prominent features within this band originate from an accidental irradiation with a 55 Fe source (5.9 and 6.5 keV) and in intrinsic contamination with 210 Pb (46.5 keV). Above the electron-recoil band so-called excess-light events are visible (see main text for further details) [26]. Only a fraction of 0.9% of the total number of events are excess-light events. However, in the region of interest below 5 keV this fraction increases to 9.2%. Thus, excesslight events have to be taken into account as background component for this work.",

With this calibration the phonon energy is equal to the deposited energy if the ratio between light and phonon energy is close to one. This is the case for events within the electron-recoil band. However, for nuclear-recoil events less light is generated and the phonon energy carries a larger fraction of the total deposited energy. This leads to a slight overestimation of the deposited energies. In [29] a correction for this effect is introduced. Since we are mainly dealing with electron-recoil events, we decided to not apply the correction from [29] for this work and assume that the total deposited energy is equal to the phonon energy. This approach is further supported by [7] where no influence of the correction from [29] on the results could be found for the data set we are using for this work.",

For a given phonon energy the statistical fluctuations of the light energies are caused by the baseline noise of the light detector and the counting statistics of the absorbed scintillation light. In principle, the light energies should follow a Poisson distribution. However, for large deposited energies a large number of photons is generated. Thus, the Poisson distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian. For small energies where this approximation would fail, the energy resolution of the light detector is dominated by the baseline noise. This noise is also very well approximated by a Gaussian (see also [30,31]). Thus, we use a Gaussian PDF for the description of the light energies of the electron-recoil band:",

The parameters S 0 and S 1 are related to the baseline noise of the phonon and light detectors and the counting statistics of absorbed scintillation light, respectively. The parameter P 0 describes the proportionality of the scintillation light with respect to the phonon energy. Due to the calibration of the light energies, P 0 is close to 1. The parameters P 1 and P 2 describe the deviation from proportionality for low energies E p . This so-called non-proportionality effect [32][33][34] is related to the energy-dependent stopping power of electrons, i.e., d E/dx is larger for electrons with low energies leading to a decreased light output [32][33][34]. Excess-light events are not described by the already mentioned Gaussian PDF for the electron-recoil band. As already stated in Sect. 2, we assume that excess light events originate from external \u03b2s traversing the scintillating detector housing before hitting the CaWO 4 crystal. Within this model, the additional scintillation light generated within the housing is added to the normal scintillation light generated by \u03b2s hitting the CaWO 4 crystal. The statistical fluctuations of the latter follow the distribution given by Eq. (8). We use an exponentially decaying function to model the additional scintillation light which is generated when particles penetrate the housing. 3 The distribution of the sum of two random variables follows the convolution of the distributions of the two random variables (see e.g. [35]). Thus, the distribution of the light energies for excess-light events is given by:",

For our data set this parameter is \u223c20 keV. Thus, the exponential decay of the mean of the electron-recoil band is not pronounced in our fit region below 5 keV. In order to obtain meaningful prior distributions, we performed a dedicated fit of the events with energies above 5 keV. As a result of this fit we use Gaussian PDFs centered around the best-fit values and widths of \u223c10% for the prior distributions of the parameters P i . Figures 4 and 5 show the results of a Bayesian fit for a fixed position of 0.4 keV for the signal peak. Figure 4 shows the phonon energies of all events in the region used for fitting. Figure 5 shows the light energies of the events within the phonon-energy slice between 0.3 keV and 1 keV. In both panels a good agreement between the data and the fit model becomes evident. The origin of the peak between 2.5 and Footnote 3 continued an exponential leads to a simpler solution of the convolution integral, we decided to use an exponential distribution. 4 i.e., Rates of signal and background components, decay constants for the exponentials in phonon and light energy for escess-light events, and S 0 and S 1 describing the width of the light-yield distribution of electron-recoil events.   For this plot only events with light energies larger than the 99% quantile of the electron-recoil band (Eq. (8)) were taken into account. In addition, the stacked distributions of all components of the fit model are shown. The contribution by the signal is too small to be visible in this plot. The drop in the models below 2 keV is related to the decreasing signal-survival probability. Bottom panel The differences between the data and the fitted model are depicted as solid black line. In addition, the statistical uncertainties (central 90% region) of the fitted model are shown as green-shaded region 3 keV is not fully understood and, thus, we conservatively did not include this peak into the background model. This leads to the discrepancies between data and model visible in Fig. 4. However, it should be mentioned that this peak has no influence on the result of the peak search performed only for energies below 2 keV. Figure 6 depicts the distribution of the phonon energies for excess-light events. For this plot only events with light energies above the 99% quantile of the electron-recoil band (Eq.

There is a variety of theories for dark matter. In recent years, theories predicting interactions of dark-matter particles with electrons rather than nuclei became more popular. One example are dark photons, i.e., long-lived vector particles with a kinetic mixing to standard-model photons.",

However, the obtained data can also be used to search for dark-matter candidates with different interactions. In this work we present the limits for the kinetic mixing of dark photons based on data from Phase 2 of CRESST-II corresponding to an exposure of 52 kg-days. To obtain this limit we performed Bayesian fits of an empirical background model and a potential dark-photon signal to the measured data. Our new limit improves the existing constraints for dark-photon masses between 0.3 and 0.7 keV/c 2 . Due to its low energy thresholds, the recently started CRESST-III Phase 1 has the potential to further improve this limits.",
