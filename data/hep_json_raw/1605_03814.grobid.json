The data were recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment in \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation was observed in 3.2 fb \u22121 of analyzed data. Results are interpreted within simplified models that assume R-parity is conserved and the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An exclusion limit at the 95 % confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at 1.51 TeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino octet and the lightest neutralino, assuming the lightest neutralino is massless. For a simplified model involving the strong production of mass-degenerate first-and second-generation squarks, squark masses below 1.03 TeV are excluded for a massless lightest neutralino. These limits substantially extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements with the ATLAS detector.

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6] is a generalization of spacetime symmetries that predicts new bosonic partners for the fermions and new fermionic partners for the bosons of the Standard Model (SM). If R-parity is conserved [7], SUSY particles (called sparticles) are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and represents a possible dark-matter candidate. The scalar partners of the left-and right-handed quarks, the squarksq L and q R , mix to form two mass eigenstatesq 1 andq 2 ordered by increasing mass. Superpartners of the charged and neutral electroweak and Higgs bosons also mix to produce charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 ) and neutralinos (\u03c7 0 ). Squarks and the fermionic partners of the gluons, the gluinos (g), could be produced in strong-interaction processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [8] and decay via cascades ending with the stable LSP, which escapes the detector unseen, producing substantial missing transverse momentum (E miss T ). The production of gluinos and squarks is the primary target for early supersymmetry searches in proton-proton ( pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC because of the large expected cross-sections predicted for the production of supersymmetric particles which participate to the strong interaction. This document presents a search for these particles in final states containing only hadronic jets and large missing transverse momentum. Interest in this final state is motivated by the large number of R-parity-conserving models [9,10] in which squarks (including anti-squarks) and gluinos can be produced in pairs (gg,qq,qg) and can decay throughq \u2192 q\u03c7 0 1 andg \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 1 to the lightest neutralino, \u03c7 0 1 , assumed to be the LSP. Additional decay modes can include the production of charginos viaq \u2192 q\u03c7 \u00b1 (wher\u1ebd q and q are of different flavour) andg \u2192 qq\u03c7 \u00b1 . Subsequent chargino decay to W \u00b1\u03c7 0 1 can lead to still larger multiplicities of jets. The analysis presented here adopts the same analysis strategy as the previous ATLAS search designed for the analysis of the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data collected during Run 1 of the LHC, described in Refs. [11][12][13][14][15].",

The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer [27], was added between Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC, at a radius of 33 mm around a new, narrower and thinner, beam pipe. The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing an axial 2 T magnetic field and by a fine-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage in the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) of the hadronic calorimeter are made of LAr active layers with either copper or tungsten as the absorber material. The muon spectrometer with an air-core toroid magnet system surrounds the calorimeters. Three layers of high-precision tracking chambers provide coverage in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, while dedicated chambers allow triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector. The positive xaxis is defined by the direction from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, with the positive y-axis pointing upwards, while the beam direction defines the z-axis. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

Application of beam, detector and data-quality criteria resulted in a total integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is \u00b15 %. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref.

The nominal cross-section is taken from an envelope of crosssection predictions using different PDF sets and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in Ref.

Cross-sections are evaluated assuming masses of 450 TeV for the light-flavour squarks in case of gluino-or gluinos in case of squark-pair production.

This generator uses the fourflavour scheme for the NLO matrix-element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4 [49]. For this process, the decay of the top quark is simulated using MadSpin tool [53] preserving all spin correlations, while for all processes the parton shower, fragmentation, and the underlying event are generated using Pythia 6.428 [54] with the CTEQ6L1 [55] PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [56]. The top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The h damp parameter, which controls the p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, is set to the mass of the top quark. The main effect of this is to regulate the highp T emission against which the ttbar system recoils [51]. The tt events are normalized to the NNLO+NNLL [57,58].

The jets are corrected for energy from pile-up using the method suggested in Ref. [74]: a contribution equal to the product of the jet area and the median energy density of the event is subtracted from the jet energy [75]. Further corrections, referred to as the jet energy scale corrections, are derived from MC simulation and data and used to calibrate on average the energies of jets to the scale of their constituent particles [76]. Only jet candidates with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8 after all corrections are retained. An algorithm based on boosted decision trees, 'MV2c20' [77], is used to identify jets containing a b-hadron (b-jets), with an operating point corresponding to an efficiency of 77 % in simulated tt events, along with a rejection factor of 140 for gluon and light-quark jets and of 4.5 for charm jets [77,78]. Candidate b-tagged jets are required to have p T > 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Events with jets originating from detector noise and non-collision background are rejected if the jets fail to satisfy the 'LooseBad' quality criteria, or if at least one of the two leading jets with p T > 100 GeV fails to satisfy the 'TightBad' quality criteria, both described in Ref.

Uncertainties in the modelling of top quark pair production are estimated by comparing Powheg-Box to aMc@Nlo [90], and by accounting for different generator and radiation tunes. Uncertainties associated with PDF modelling of top quark pair production are found to be negligible. Uncertainties in diboson production due to PDF, renormalization, factorization and resummation scale uncertainties (estimated by increasing and decreasing the scales used in the MC generators by a factor of two) Table 5 Numbers of events observed in the signal regions used in the analysis compared with background expectations obtained from the fits described in the text. No signal contribution is considered in the CRs for the fit. Empty cells (indicated by a '-') correspond to estimates lower than 0.01. The p-values ( p 0 ) give the probabilities of the observations being consistent with the estimated backgrounds. For an observed number of events lower than expected, the p value is truncated at 0.5. Between parentheses, p-values are also given as the number of equivalent Gaussian standard deviations (Z Events / 100 GeV are accounted for by applying a uniform 50 % uncertainty in all SRs, and are the dominant source of uncertainty in SRs 2jl and 2jm. Uncertainties associated with the modelling of Z +jets production are largest in the SRs with tight selection cuts (up to 14 %). The statistical uncertainty arising from the use of MC samples is largest (8 %) in SR 6jt. The uncertainties arising from the data-driven correction procedure applied to events selected in the CR\u03b3 region, described in Sect. 7, are included in Table 4 under 'CR\u03b3 corr. factor' and reach a value of 4 % in most of the SRs. The impact of lepton reconstruction uncertainties, and of the uncertainties related to the b-tag/b-veto efficiency, on the overall background uncertainty are found to be negligible for all SRs. The total background uncertainties for all SRs, broken down into the main contributing sources, are summarized in Table 4. The number of events observed in the data and the number of SM events expected to enter each of the signal regions, determined using the background-only fit, are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 4. The pre-fit background expectations are also shown in Table 5 for comparison. The normalisation factors extracted simultaneously through the fit range for the different signal regions between 0.7 and 1.2 for W +jets, 0.4 and 0.8 for tt(+EW) + single top, and 1.0 and 1.6 for Z /\u03b3 * +jets backgrounds. Distributions of m eff (incl.) obtained before the final selections on this quantity (but after applying all other selections), for data and the different MC samples normalized with the theoretical cross-sections, i.e. before applying the normalization from the CR fit, are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Examples of typical expected SUSY signals are shown for illustration. These signals correspond to the processes to which each SR is primarily sensitive -qq production for the lower jet-multiplicity SRs andgg production for the higher jetmultiplicity SRs. In these figures, data and background distributions largely agree within uncertainties. The differences seen in the lower regions of m eff (incl.) distribution (1.2 -2.0 TeV) in Fig. 6 do not affect the background expectations in the signal regions since the backgrounds are normalized using control regions (Table 3) with the same m eff (incl.) selections. The fit to the CRs for each SR compensates for the differences related to the overall normalization of the background seen in Figs. 5 and 6, leading to the good agreements between data and post-fit expectations in the SRs observed in Table 5 and Fig. 4.",

Results are compared with the observed limits obtained from the statistical combination of the search with no lepton and the search with one isolated lepton, highp T jets and missing transverse momentum performed at ATLAS [15] using the 8 TeV data. Statistical combinations of these two searches, designed to be statistically independent in their signal and control region definitions, are performed in order to increase the exclusion reach in models in which at least two analyses obtain comparable sensitivities, and still provide the strongest exclusion  limits in the region of parameter space in which the mass of gluino is between 700 and 1100 GeV and the\u03c7 0 1 mass is above \u223c500 GeV.",

            "text": "Results are interpreted in terms of simplified models with only light-flavour squarks, or gluinos, together with a neutralino LSP, with the masses of all the other SUSY particles set beyond the reach of the LHC. For a massless lightest neutralino, gluino masses below 1.51 TeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level in a simplified model with only gluinos and the lightest neutralino. For a simplified model involving the strong production of squarks of the first and second generations, with decays to a massless lightest neutralino, squark masses below 1.03 TeV are excluded, assuming massdegenerate squarks. In simplified models with pair-produced gluinos, each decaying via an intermediate\u03c7 \u00b1 1 to two quarks, a W boson and a\u03c7 0 1 , gluino masses below 1.5 TeV are excluded for\u03c7 0 1 masses of \u223c 200 GeV. These results substantially extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous LHC searches.
