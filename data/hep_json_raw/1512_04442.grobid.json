The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected at the LHCb experiment. The complete angular information from the decay is used to determine CP -averaged observables and CP asymmetries, taking account of possible contamination from decays with the K + \u03c0 \u2212 system in an S-wave configuration. The angular observables and their correlations are reported in bins of q 2 , the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution. In addition, by fitting for q 2 -dependent decay amplitudes in the region 1.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 , the zero-crossing points of several angular observables are computed. A global fit is performed to the complete set of CP -averaged observables obtained from the maximum likelihood fit. This fit indicates differences with predictions based on the Standard Model at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. These differences could be explained by contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, or by an unexpectedly large hadronic effect that is not accounted for in the Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "The decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 proceeds via a b \u2192 s quark flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transition. In the Standard Model (SM) the decay is therefore forbidden at tree level and occurs, at lowest order, via electroweak penguin and box processes. In extensions of the SM, new particles may enter in competing processes and can significantly change the branching fraction of the decay and the angular distribution of the final-state particles. Angular observables are of particular interest, since theoretical predictions of such observables tend to be less affected by the hadronic uncertainties associated with the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 transition. Throughout this paper K * 0 is used to refer to the K * (892) 0 resonance. The LHCb collaboration previously determined a set of angular observables in the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay, 1 using data collected during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 [1]. Different subsets of these angular observables have also been measured by the BaBar, Belle, CDF and CMS collaborations [2][3][4][5][6][7] and all of these measurements are in good agreement with SM predictions. The LHCb collaboration has also used the 2011 dataset to determine an alternative set of angular observables that have reduced theoretical uncertainties [8]. In contrast to the previous analyses, these observables cannot be extracted from single angle distributions. This second LHCb analysis found a local deviation with respect to the SM prediction in one observable, P 5 , with a significance corresponding to 3.7 standard deviations. Possible interpretations of this discrepancy and the consistency of all of the measurements of b \u2192 s transitions have been widely discussed in the literature [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21].",

The data were recorded in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV during 2011 and 2012, respectively. All previous analyses of the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay have extracted only part of the information available, by fitting simplified forms of the angular distribution. This paper presents a complete set of observables for the first time, based on the full angular distribution. The simultaneous determination of these observables allows correlations between the measured quantities to be computed, enabling the use of the results in global fits to theoretical models. This is critical to understand whether SM dynamics are sufficient to explain the above discrepancy, or if extensions to the SM are necessary.",

Therefore, as in the determination of the angular moments, the statistical uncertainties of the q 2 -dependent observables and their corresponding zero-crossing points are determined using a bootstrapping technique [51]. The statistical coverage of the resulting intervals is checked using simulated events and is found to be correct for the observables S 4 , S 5 and A FB .
