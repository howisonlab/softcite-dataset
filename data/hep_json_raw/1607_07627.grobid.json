We consider final states containing a lepton and at least three jets. The polarization is measured through the distribution of lepton angles along three axes: the beam axis, the helicity axis, and the transverse axis normal to the tt production plane. This is the first measurement of top quark polarization at Tevatron using lepton+jet final states and the first measurement of the transverse polarization in tt production. The observed distributions are consistent with standard model predictions of nearly no polarization.",

The quantization axes are defined in the tt rest frame, while the decay product directions are defined after successively boosting the particles to the tt rest frame and then to the parent top quark rest frame. We measure the polarization along three quantization axes: (i) beam axi\u015d n p , given by the direction of the proton beam [2], (ii) helicity axisn h , given by the direction of the parent top or antitop quark, and (iii) transverse axisn T , given as perpendicular to the production plane defined by the proton and parent top quark directions, i.e.,n p \u00d7n t (or byn p \u00d7 \u2212n t for the antitop quark) [4,5]. The D0 Collaboration published a short study of the top quark polarization along the helicity axis in pp collisions as part of the measurement of angular asymmetries of leptons [6] but no measured value was presented. Recently, the D0 Collaboration measured the top quark polarization along the beam axis in tt final states with two leptons [7], finding it to be consistent with the SM. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations measured the top quark polarization along the helicity axis in pp collisions, and the results are consistent with no polarization [8,9]. The polarization at the Tevatron and LHC are expected to be different because of the difference in the initial states, which motivates the measurement of the polarizations in Tevatron data [10,11]. For beam and transverse axes, the top quark polarizations in pp collisions are expected to be larger than those for pp [2,4], therefore offering greater sensitivity to BSM models with non-zero polarization.",

The lepton is most sensitive to the polarization and is easily identified. We therefore examine the angular distribution of leptons. After selecting the events in the \u2113+jets final state, we perform a kinematic fit to reconstruct the lepton angles relative to the various axes. The resulting distributions are fitted with mixtures of signal templates with +1 and \u22121 polarizations to extract the observed values. The down-type quark has an analyzing power close to unity, but its identification is difficult. It is therefore not used in the measurement. However, to gain statistical precision we use reweighted Monte Carlo (MC) down-type quark distributions in forming signal event templates.",

In \u2113+jets events, one of the W bosons decays leptonically and the other into quarks that evolve into jets. The trigger selects \u2113+jets events with at least one lepton, electron (e) or a muon (\u00b5), with efficiency of 95% or 80% for tt events containing reconstructed e or \u00b5 candidates, respectively. This analysis requires the presence of one isolated e [15] or \u00b5 [16] with transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and physics pseudorapidity [14] |\u03b7| < 1.1 or |\u03b7| < 2, respectively. In addition, leptons are required to originate from within 1 cm of the primary pp interaction vertex (PV) in the coordinate along the beam axis. Accepted events must have a reconstructed PV within 60 cm of the center of the detector along the beam axis. Furthermore, we require an imbalance in transverse momentum / p T > 20 GeV, expected from the undetected neutrino. Jets are reconstructed using an iterative cone algorithm [17] with a cone parameter of R = 0.5. Jet energies are corrected to the particle level using calibrations from studies of exclusive \u03b3+jet, Z+jet, and dijet events [18]. These calibrations account for differences in detector response to jets originating from gluons, b quarks, and u, d, s, or c quarks. We require at least three jets with p T > 20 GeV within |\u03b7| < 2.5, and p T > 40 GeV for the jet of highest p T . At least one jet per event is required to be identified as originating from a b quark (b tagged) through the use of a multivariate algorithm [19]. In \u00b5+jets events, upper limits are required on the transverse mass of the reconstructed W boson [20] of M W T < 250 GeV and / p T < 250 GeV to remove events with misreconstructed muon p T . Additional selections are applied to reduce backgrounds in muon events, and to suppress contributions from multijet production. A detailed description of these requirements can be found in Ref. [21]. In addition, we require the curvature of the track associated with the lepton to be well measured to reduce lepton charge misidentification.",

Parton showering, hadronization, and modeling of the underlying event are performed with herwig [24] for mc@nlo events and with pythia 6.4 [25] for alpgen events. The detector response is simulated using geant3 [26]. To model the effects of multiple pp interactions, the MC events are overlaid with events from random pp collisions with the same luminosity distribution as data. The main background to the tt signal is W +jets events, where the W boson is produced via the electroweak interaction together with additional partons from QCD radiation. The W +jets final state can be split into four subsamples according to parton flavor: W bb + jets, W cc + jets, W c + jets, and W +light jets, where light refers to gluons, u, d, or s quarks. The W +jets background is modeled with alpgen and pythia [23,25], as is the background from Z+jets events. Other background processes include W W , W Z, and ZZ diboson productions simulated using pythia, and single top quark electroweak production simulated using comphep [27]. The multijet background, where a jet is misidentified as an isolated lepton, is estimated from the data using the matrix method [21,28]. We use six different BSM models [29] to study modified tt production: one Z \u2032 boson model and five axigluon models with different axigluon masses and couplings (m200R, m200L, m200A, m2000R, and m2000A, where L, R, and A refer to left-handed, right-handed, and axial couplings, and numbers are the particle masses in GeV). Some additional axigluon models such as m2000L are not simulated as they are excluded by other measurements of top quark properties. The BSM events are generated with LO madgraph 5 [30] interfaced to pythia for parton evolution.",

We use the SM values C = \u22120.368 (helicity axis) and C = 0.791 (beam axis), both calculated at NLO in QCD and in electroweak couplings in Ref. [2]. The spin correlation factor is not known for the transverse axis, and thus we set C = 0 and assign a systematic uncertainty by varying the choice of this factor. The Pn ,i represents the polarization state we model (here Pn ,i = \u00b11) along the chosen axisn. In the SM, assuming CP invariance, Pn ,1 = Pn ,2 and gives the relative sign factor \u03c1 a value of +1 for the helicity axis and \u22121 for the beam and transverse axes [2]. A simultaneous fit is performed for the eight samples defined according to lepton flavor (e or \u00b5), lepton charge, and number of jets (3 or \u2265 4). The observed polarization is taken as P = f + \u2212 f \u2212 , where f \u00b1 are the fraction of events with P = +1 and \u22121 returned from the fit. The fitting procedure and methodological approach are verified using pseudo-experiments for five values of polarization, and through a check of consistency with predictions, using the BSM models with non-zero generated longitudinal polarizations. The fitted polarizations and the model inputs are in good agreement, as shown in Fig. 2 for the polarizations along the beam axis, thus verifying our template methodology. The distributions in the cosine of the polar angle of leptons from tt decay for all three axes are shown in Fig. 3. A previous measurement of top quark polarization and the forward-backward t andt asymmetry in dilepton final states [7] noted a correlation between these two measurements. This correlation is caused by acceptance and resolution effects in the kinematic reconstruction of the events. We determine the dependence of the observed polarization on the forward-backward asymmetry at the parton level, A FB , using samples in which the t and t rapidity distributions are reweighted to accommodate the polarizations. We then use a correction for the difference between the nominal mc@nlo production-level A FB of (5.01 \u00b1 0.03)% and the NNLO calculation [34] of (9.5 \u00b1 0.7)%. The observed correction is \u22120.030 for the polarization along the beam axis, less than 0.002 for the polarization along the helicity axis, and is negligible for the transverse polarization. The uncertainty on the expected A FB is propagated to the measurement as part of the methodology systematic uncertainty.",

The systematic uncertainty source indicates difference in polarization when the measurement is repeated using alternative modeling, after applying uncertainties from the employed methods, or from assumptions made in the measurement. The uncertainties are added in quadrature to form groups of systematic sources and the total uncertainty.",
