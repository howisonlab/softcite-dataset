            "text": "A search for narrow vector resonances decaying into quark-antiquark pairs is presented. The analysis is based on data collected in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The hypothetical resonance is produced with sufficiently high transverse momentum that its decay products are merged into a single jet with two-prong substructure. A signal would be identified as a peak over a smoothly falling background in the distribution of the invariant mass of the jet, using novel jet substructure techniques. No evidence for such a resonance is observed within the mass range of 50-300 GeV. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section, and presented in a mass-coupling parameter space. The limits further constrain simplified models of dark matter production involving a mediator interacting between quarks and dark matter particles through a vector or axial-vector current. In the framework of these models, the results are the most sensitive to date, extending for the first time the search region to masses below 100 GeV.",

The first searches for such particles were reported by the UA1 [12] and UA2 [13,14] experiments using \u221a s = 630 GeV collisions at the CERN SppS, and were extended to larger values of resonance masses by the CDF [15][16][17][18][19] and D0 [20] experiments using \u221a s = 1.8 and 1.96 TeV collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron. At the CERN LHC, the searches in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] and CMS [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35] Collaborations have mostly focused on the production of heavy particles. For resonance masses below 1 TeV, the sensitivity is limited by high trigger thresholds and by the large expected backgrounds, notably from SM events consisting of jets produced through the strong interaction, referred to here as QCD multijet events.",

The search is performed by looking for a narrow resonance peak in the continuous jet mass distribution. The analysis exploits a new substructure variable that is decorrelated from the jet mass and p T and preserves the shape of the jet mass distribution used in the search. The jet is required to have the two-prong substructure expected from the signal. The dominant background from SM QCD multijet production is estimated from a signal-depleted control region created by inverting the substructure requirement. The signal yield is extracted by simultaneously fitting the signal and control regions, while requiring that the ratio of QCD components in each region is described by a smooth twodimensional function of jet mass and p T . The W+jets and Z+jets background components are estimated from simulation and the top quark background contribution is obtained from simulation corrected with scale factors derived from a tt-enriched control sample.",

These backgrounds are simulated at LO using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo generator with the MLM matching [42] between jets from matrix element calculations and from parton showers, while the powheg 2.0 [43] generator at nextto-leading order (NLO) precision is used to model the subdominant contribution from pair and single top quark production. All signal and background generators are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [44], with the CUETP8M1 underlying event tune [45], to simulate parton showering and hadronization effects. The generated events are further processed through a Geant4 [46] simulation of the CMS detector. The parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 [47] is used to produce all simulated samples, with the accuracy (LO or NLO) determined by the generator used. For events containing W and Z bosons, we apply higher-order QCD and electroweak (EW) p T dependent corrections to improve the modeling of the p T distribution of W and Z events, following refs.

Each particle candidate is classified as either an electron, a muon, a photon, or a charged or neutral hadron. The energy of photons is obtained directly from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zerosuppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. The missing transverse momentum vector is defined as the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all the particles identified in the event, and its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . The PF candidates are clustered into jets using the anti-k T algorithm [54,55]. Jets are clustered with distance parameters of 0.4 and 0.8, and are referred to as AK4 and AK8 jets, respectively. To mitigate the impact of particles arising from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup), weights calculated with JHEP01(2018)097 the pileup-per-particle identification algorithm [56] are applied to each PF candidate prior to jet clustering, based on the likelihood of it coming from the hard-scattering vertex. Further corrections are applied to simulated jet energies as a function of jet \u03b7 and p T to match the observed detector response [57,58].",

In addition, soft radiation remnants are removed with the jet trimming technique [59] before the mass selection, allowing the H T and jet p T trigger thresholds to be reduced, and improving the signal acceptance.

The search is performed using the distribution of the jet mass groomed with the soft-drop algorithm (m SD ), which is an extension of the modified mass drop tagger [60,61] that removes soft and wide-angle radiation produced by parton shower activity, pileup interactions, and the underlying event from the jet. Jets are groomed using the parameters z cut = 0.1 and \u03b2 = 0. Here, z cut specifies subleading the energy fraction relative to the whole jet at which jet declustering into subjet pairs is stopped. The parameter \u03b2 adds additional angular requirements on the jet declustering. For \u03b2 = 0, these requirements are neglected, and approximately the same fraction of energy is groomed away regardless of the initial jet energy [61]. The soft-drop grooming reduces the jet mass for QCD background jets when large masses arise from soft gluon radiation. In contrast, the jet mass for merged Z \u2192 qq and W/Z \u2192 qq jets comes from the kinematic distributions of the decay, and is largely unchanged by grooming. Figure 1 shows the distributions of m SD for data and simulation, after the jet kinematic selection.",

For QCD jets, the distribution of \u03c1 is approximately invariant under a change of jet p T , in the region where perturbative contributions dominate and scale as (m SD /p T ). This property does not hold in two regimes: in the low mass region below \u03c1 \u2248 \u22126, where non-perturbative effects are large and scale as (1/m SD ) instead, and in the high mass region above \u03c1 \u2248 \u22122. The departure from \u03c1 invariance in the latter case arises because the cone size of the AK8 jets is insufficient to provide complete containment at high masses. Consequently, only events in the range \u22125.5 < \u03c1 < \u22122.0 are considered. This requirement is fully efficient for the Z boson signal and roughly translates to a m SD range from 25 GeV to 185 GeV at p T = 500 GeV.  Figure 1.

            "text": "The systematic effects for the shapes and normalization of the W, Z backgrounds, and signal components are strongly correlated since they are affected by similar systematic mismeasurements. We constrain the jet mass scale, the jet mass resolution, and the N 1,DDT 2 selection efficiency using a sample of merged W boson jets in semileptonic tt events in data. In this region, events are required to have an energetic muon with p T > 100 GeV, p miss T > 80 GeV, a high-p T AK8 jet with p T > 200 GeV, and a b-tagged AK4 jet separated from the AK8 jet by \u2206R > 0.8. Using the same N 1,DDT 2 requirement described above, we define samples with events that pass and fail the selection for merged W boson jets in data and simulation, shown in figure 5. A simultaneous fit to the two samples is performed in order to extract the selection efficiency of a merged W jet in simulation and in data. We measure the data-to-simulation scale factor for the N 1,DDT 2 selection to be 0.88 \u00b1 0.10. The mass scale between data and simulation is found to be 1.10 \u00b1 0.05. The jet mass resolution data-to-simulation scale factor is measured to be 1.14 \u00b1 0.06. These scale factors determine the initial distributions of the jet mass for the W, Z boson, and signal and they are further constrained in the fit to data because of the presence of the W and Z resonances in the jet mass distribution. To account for potential deviations due to missing higher-order corrections to the simulated boson p T distributions, uncertainties are assumed in the W and Z boson yields that are p T -dependent. An additional systematic uncertainty is included to account for potential differences between the W and Z boson higher-order corrections. Finally, uncertainties associated to the jet energy resolution [57], trigger efficiency, lepton veto efficiency, and the integrated luminosity determination [67] are also applied to the W, Z boson, and Z boson signal yields. A quantitative summary of the systematic effects considered is listed in table 1.",

As a further test of fit robustness, we split the region failing the N 1,DDT 2 selection into two smaller regions mimicking the passing and failing regions in the signal extraction fit. The mimicked passing-like region corresponds to a background efficiency of 60-65% and the mimicked failing-like region corresponds to an efficiency of 65-100%.

Figure 8 shows the excluded values at 95% CL of mediator mass (m Med ) as a function of the dark matter particle mass (m DM ) for vector mediators, in simplified models that assume a leptophobic mediator that couples only to quarks and DM particles [38,73]. Limits are shown for a choice of universal quark coupling g q = 0.25 and a DM coupling g DM = 1.0. The difference in limits between axial-vector and vector mediator couplings is small and thus only constraints for the latter coupling scenario are shown. The excluded range of mediator mass (red) is between 50 and 300 GeV. The upper bound decreases to 240 GeV when m Med > 2m DM , because the branching fraction (BR) to qq decreases as the BR to DM becomes kinematically favorable. If m Med < 2m DM , the mediator cannot decay to DM particles and the dijet cross section from the mediator model becomes identical to that in the leptophobic Z model, meaning that the limits on the mediator mass in figure 8 are identical to the limits on the Z mass with a coupling g q = g q = 0.25. For axialvector mediators, the excluded values of mediator mass are expected to be identical to the excluded values in figure 8 when m DM > m Med /2 or m DM = 0, with differences only expected in the transition region m Med 2m DM . Additional limits (blue) in figure 8 come from traditional dijet searches [35].",

Residual differences between data and simulation demonstrate the need for a background estimation method based on control samples in data.",
