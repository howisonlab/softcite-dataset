A detailed study to develop a robust methodology for determining the tracking efficiency is essential for both software development and experimental data analysis. However, the tracking efficiency is not always given a good definition or straightforward determination. This paper, focusing on the methodology, presents a detailed study of tracking efficiency and its systematic uncertainty, with various influencing factors on the efficiency, as well as a number of essential validations.",

If it is represented in two dimensions, P T versus cos\u03b8, then the systematic uncertainty for other processes can be obtained by sampling this twodimensional systematic uncertainty. An example of such a two-dimensional plot is shown in Figure 4 for protons, as a function of cos\u03b8 and P T , in which the colors in each box represents the corresponding tracking efficiency or systematic uncertainty. The results of tracking efficiencies and its systematic uncertainties will be helpful for software development, especially for MDC track reconstruction. For example, one can find the tracking efficiency is less than 0.9 when P T < 0.15 GeV/c in Figure 3(a), and the systematic uncertainty is also relatively larger. Low momentum track reconstruction is difficult, since electromagnetic multiple scattering, electric field leakage, energy loss etc. become stronger, and charged tracks with transverse momenta less than 0.12 GeV/c will circle within the MDC. The BESIII software group have used a TCurlFinder method [9] to increase tracking efficiency for low-momentum tracks, and improved the MDC MC tuning model to decrease its systematic uncertainty [10]. There is still room for improvement of the low momentum track reconstruction and MC tuning, with the assistance of this study.   ",

The momentum and polar angle ranges of the single track MC is required to be similar to the exclusive MC, then a comparison of the tracking efficiency between these two MC samples are supplied.

Two run periods were chosen to compare the differences in tracking efficiency and uncertainty, one being a typical low noise level run period (RUN I), and the other a typical high noise level run period (RUN II). Figure 5 shows the tracking efficiencies with different noise levels from exclusive MC for protons and pions, respectively. The results show that high noise level run period has about 2% lower efficiency compared with the low noise level run period when P T < 0.3 GeV/c. Since the different noise levels for different periods of data have been introduced into the MC simulation, the systematic uncertainties of tracking are not subject to the noise level.",

            "text": "(iv) Comparing results with different vertex cuts: Although the qualification for vertex cuts ought to be standard, as an elementary requirement which is used in almost every analysis, |R xy | < 1.0 cm, |Z| < 10.0 cm; |R xy | < 2.0 cm, |Z| < 10.0 cm; and |R xy | < 2.0 cm, |Z| < 20.0 cm are three common cuts which can be found in different BESIII data analyses. A comparison of these three vertex cuts shows that the efficiencies at low P T are obviously influenced by the different requirements.  Figure 6 shows the tracking efficiencies with different vertex cuts from exclusive MC for protons and pions, respectively. The results show the efficiency from the tightest vertex cut is lower by about 5% compared with the loosest cut at low P T . The data sample behaves in the same way as the MC sample, so the systematic uncertainties of tracking efficiency are insensitive to the vertex cuts. (v) The influence of extra tracks: The n and N in Eq. 1 were explained to be the number of signal events in which the number of reconstructed charged tracks are greater than three and four, respectively, which allows some extra tracks in the definition. A reconstructed track with some extra fake reconstructed tracks was introduced to the tracking efficiency in this study, but the extra tracks may be avoided in most physics analyses, on account of the requirement of zero net charge. The influence of the extra tracks should be evaluated. When count the number of charged tracks in each event, only a few events have the number of charged tracks greater than four, which means the extra fake tracks are seldom reconstructed. The tracking efficiencies with or without the extra tracks were compared for both MC and data samples, and found to have consistent tracking efficiencies (the differences are less than 0.1%). Therefore, the influence of extra tracks can be neglected.",
