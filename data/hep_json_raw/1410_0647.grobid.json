The analyzed data set was recorded by the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum and exactly two b-tagged jets. A multivariate event classifier based on boosted decision trees is developed to discriminate s-channel single top-quark events from the main background contributions. The signal extraction is based on a binned maximum-likelihood fit of the output classifier distribution. The analysis leads to an upper limit on the s-channel single topquark production cross-section of 14.6 pb at the 95% confidence level. The fit gives a cross-section of \u03c3 s = 5.0 \u00b1 4.3 pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation.",

            "text": "At hadron colliders, top-quarks are produced predominantly in pairs (tt) via the strong interaction but can also be produced singly through the electroweak interaction. At leading order in perturbation theory, there are three possible single top-quark production modes: an exchange of a virtual W boson either in the t-channel or in the s-channel, or the associated production of a top-quark and a W boson. In the s-channel, the exchange of a time-like W boson produces a top-quark and a bottom-quark in the final state [1]. Independent measurements of these three modes are of great interest since different impacts on their production rates are predicted by the various proposed scenarios beyond the Standard Model [2].",

            "text": "Single top-quark production was first observed at the Tevatron in proton-antiproton collisions by the CDF and D0 Collaborations in measurements of the combined s-and t-channel production [3,4]. The observation of the s-channel process alone through the combination of the CDF [5] and D0 [6] cross-section measurements was reported recently [7]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the production cross-section of single tops in proton-proton (pp) collisions was measured both in the t-channel and in association with a W boson by the CMS [8][9][10][11] and ATLAS [12][13][14] Collaborations. Measuring the s-channel process is more difficult due to a much smaller signal-to-background ratio, this production mode being disadvantaged at the LHC due to the need for a sea antiquark in the initial state.

For the s-channel process, the total inclusive cross-section for pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV is predicted to be \u03c3 s = 5.61 \u00b1 0.22 pb. This assumes a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV and uses the MSTW2008 [18] NNLO set of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The quoted uncertainty includes the QCD scale uncertainty and the correlated PDF-\u03b1 s uncertainty. The cross-sections calculated at approximate NNLO for the dominant t-channel and W t processes are \u03c3 t = 87.8 +3.4 \u22121.9 pb [15] and \u03c3 W t = 22.4 \u00b1 1.5 pb [16],",

The transverse momentum of the neutrino is assumed to be given by the x-and y-components of the missing transverse momentum, while the unmeasured longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is extracted by imposing a W boson mass constraint on the lepton-neutrino system. The latter leads to a quadratic equation in the longitudinal momentum component of the neutrino, p \u03bd z . If there are two real solutions the ambiguity is resolved by choosing the one with the smallest |p \u03bd z |. For complex solutions due to the non-perfect resolution of the missing transverse momentum measurement, the imaginary component is eliminated by modifying E miss T in such a way that the transverse mass of the W candidate fulfills the W mass constraint, while preserving the direction of the missing transverse momentum. The kinematics of two top-quark candidates are then reconstructed by combining the four-momenta of the lepton and neutrino with each of the two b-jets (called leading and sub-leading jets according to their ranking in p T ). The top-quark candidate with an invariant mass closest to 172.5 GeV defines the best candidate.

Multijet events pass the signal selection if in addition to two reconstructed and b-tagged jets an extra jet is misidentified as an isolated lepton, or a non-prompt lepton appears to be isolated (both referred to as a fake lepton). This background is estimated from data using the matrix method [61]. In this approach, a set of equations is solved, which relates the observed sample composition in terms of selected leptons of two different categories, loose and tight, to its true composition in terms of prompt (real) and fake leptons. The tight category corresponds to the signal selection mentioned in Section 3, while the isolation requirements are removed to define the loose category, which also has a loosened identification quality in the electron case. The real and fake efficiencies are measured using dedicated samples of data enriched in real and fake isolated leptons. An uncertainty of 50% on the multijet event yield is evaluated from comparisons with alternative procedures for the efficiency extraction and alternative criteria for the selection of the real-and fake-enriched samples.",

Other jet-related uncertainty sources are the modelling of the energy resolution [64] and reconstruction efficiency [27], and the modelling of the tagging efficiencies of b-jets, c-jets and light-quark jets [28,29]. Uncertainties related to the leptons come from trigger, identification and isolation efficiencies, as well as from the energy scale and resolution [21,23]. The uncertainties from the energy scale and resolution corrections applied to leptons and jets are propagated to the computation of the missing transverse momentum. The scale and resolution uncertainties due to soft jets (p T < 20 GeV) and to contributions of calorimeter energy deposits not associated with any reconstructed objects are also considered and evaluated independently (uncertainties referred to as E miss T scale and resolution). The luminosity measurement is calibrated using dedicated beam-separation scans and the same methodology as that detailed in Ref. [20].

The likelihood function is given by the product of Poisson probability terms for the individual distribution bins (see Ref. [12]), combined with the product of Gaussian functions to constrain the background rates to their predicted values within the associated uncertainties. The rates of the tt, W + jets, and combined t-channel/W t and Z + jets/diboson backgrounds are thus fitted within their theoretical uncertainties described in Section 7; since the multijet component is obtained from the data it is not allowed to vary and is fixed to its data-driven estimate. The production cross-section is derived from the adjusted signal rate for which the logarithm of the likelihood function reaches its maximum.",

Table 2 summarizes the various contributions to the measurement uncertainty. The largest systematic uncertainties arise from the scale of the missing transverse momentum (54%) and of the jet energy (39%). These large uncertainties are due to a strongly distorted shape of the BDT distribution obtained when adding bin-per-bin the systematic variations affecting the signal and background contributions. The limited size of the data sample and the simulated samples also contribute significantly to the final uncertainty (35% and 29%, respectively). Smaller uncertainties are due to the background normalizations (12% for the data-driven multijet contribution and 7% from theory for the simulated backgrounds) and process modelling (11%, 8% and 6% for signal, W + jets and tt, respectively). Other modelling and instrumental effects play only a minor role.",
