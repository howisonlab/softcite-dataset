The last 15 years have witnessed the triumph of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism, which describes all flavour changing transitions of quarks in the Standard Model. This important milestone has been reached owing to a series of experiments, in particular to those operating at the so-called B factories, at the Tevatron, and now at the LHC. We briefly review status and perspectives of flavour physics, highlighting the results where the LHC has given the most significant contributions, notably including the recent observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay.",

The SM is able to describe with excellent accuracy all of the fundamental physics phenomena related to the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces, observed to date. Yet, it fails with some key aspects, notably including the fact that it does not provide an answer to one of the most fundamental questions: why is antimatter absent from the observed universe? Owing to the work of Andrei Sakharov in 1967 [1], the phenomenon of CP violation, i.e. the non-invariance of the laws of nature under the combined application of charge (C) and parity (P ) transformations, is known to be one of the ingredients needed to dynamically generate a baryon asymmetry starting from an initially symmetric universe. However, it is also known that the size of CP violation in the SM is too small, by several orders of magnitude, to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe [2][3][4]. As a consequence, other sources of CP violation beyond the SM (BSM), which should produce observable effects in the form of deviations from the SM predictions of certain CP -violating quantities, must exist. Rare decays that are strongly suppressed in the SM are of particular interest, since BSM amplitudes could be relatively sizable with respect to those of the SM.",

Besides the Higgs discovery, analyses from the first years of running have also firmly established the great impact of the ATLAS [7], CMS [8] and LHCb [9] experiments in the field of CP violation and rare decays of heavy-flavoured hadrons. In particular, LHCb has produced a plethora of results on a broad range of flavour observables in the c-and b-quark sectors, and ATLAS and CMS have given significant contributions to the b-quark sector, mainly using final states containing muon pairs. Also these measurements do not provide hints of BSM physics.",

As an example, one of the most notable predictions made in this context was that of the existence of a third quark generation, in a famous paper of 1973 by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa [10]. In that work, which won them the Nobel Price in Physics in 2008 \"for the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature\", Kobayashi and Maskawa extended the Cabibbo [11] (with only u, d, and s quarks) and the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani [12] (GIM, including also the c quark) mechanisms, pointing out that CP violation could be incorporated into the emerging picture of the SM if six quarks were present. This is commonly referred to as the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) mechanism. It must be emphasised that at that time only hadrons made of the three lighter quarks had been observed. An experimental revolution took place in 1974, when a new state containing the c quark was discovered almost simultaneously at Brookhaven [13] and SLAC [14]. Then, the experimental observations of the b [15] and t [16] quarks were made at FNAL in 1977 and 1995, respectively.",

Pioneering steps in the b-quark flavour sector were moved at the beginning of the 1980's by the CLEO experiment at CESR [18]. At the same time, Ikaros Bigi, Ashton Carter and Tony Sanda published papers exploring the possibility that large CP -violating effects could be present in the decay rates of B 0 mesons decaying to the J/\u03c8K 0 S CP eigenstate [19,20]. In addition, they also pointed out that such a measurement could be interpreted in terms of the CP -violating phase without relevant theoretical uncertainties due to strong interaction effects. However, there were two formidable obstacles to overcome: first, an experimental observation required an enormous amount of B 0 mesons, well beyond what was conceivable to produce and collect at the time; second, a precise measurement of the decay time was required, together with the knowledge of the flavour of the B 0 meson at production.",

Another crucial ingredient came along due to tremendous developments in the performance of e + e \u2212 storage rings. By the late 1980's, many different possible designs for new machines were being explored. A novel idea was put forward by Pier Oddone in 1987: a high-luminosity asymmetrical e + e \u2212 circular collider operating at the centre-of-mass energy of the \u03a5(4S) meson [22]. Owing to the beam-energy asymmetry, B mesons would be produced with a boost in the laboratory frame towards the direction of the most energetic beam. The consequent nonzero decay length, measured by means of state-of-the-art silicon vertex detectors, would enable precise measurements of the decay time to be achieved. Two machines based on Oddone's concept, so-called B factories, were eventually built: PEP-II at SLAC in the United States and KEKB at KEK in Japan. The associated detectors, BaBar [23] at PEP-II and Belle [24] at KEKB, were approved in 1993 and in 1994, respectively. If CESR was initially able to produce few tens of bb pairs per day, PEP-II and KEKB were capable of producing order of one million bb pairs per day.",

Despite the relatively small statistics, b hadrons produced in Z 0 decays were naturally characterised by a large boost, enabling measurements of lifetimes of all b-hadron species and of oscillation frequencies of neutral B mesons to be performed. In particular, for the first time it was possible to study samples of B 0 s -meson, b-baryon and even a handful of B + c -meson decays [30,31]. Similar pioneering measurements were also made at the Tevatron with Run I data, using hadronic collisions as a source of b quarks [32].",

            "text": "When the constructions of the BaBar and Belle detectors were being scrutinised for approval, three distinct proposals for a dedicated b-physics experiment at the LHC were put forward, so-called COBEX, GAJET, and LHB. GAJET and LHB were both based on fixed targets, the former working with a gas target placed inside the LHC beam pipe and the latter exploiting an extracted LHC beam. COBEX was instead proposed to work in proton-proton collider mode. The three groups of proponents were asked to join together and submit to the LHC Experiments Committee (LHCC) a proposal for a single collider-mode experiment, namely LHCb [9]. LHCb was then designed to exploit the potential for heavy-flavour physics at the LHC by instrumenting the forward region of proton-proton collisions, in order to take advantage of the large bb cross section in the forward (or backward) LHC beam direction. The LHCb experiment was approved in 1998, and started taking data with the start-up of LHC in 2009. The LHCb detector [9,37], shown in Fig. 1, includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a largearea silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The silicon sensors of the vertex detector come as close as 8 mm to the LHC beam. This allows for a very precise measurement of the track trajectory close to the interaction point, which is crucial to separate decays of beauty and charm hadrons, with typical flight distances of a few millimetres in the laboratory frame, from the background. The distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of 15-30 \u00b5m.",

Once particle momenta are measured, the two RICH detectors enable the identification of protons, kaons and pions to be obtained. An electromagnetic calorimeter, complemented with scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, provides energy and position of photons and electrons, and allow for their identification in conjunction with information from the tracking system. The electromagnetic calorimeter is followed by a hadronic calorimeter that also gives some information to identify hadrons. Finally, muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [38] which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies full event reconstruction.",

Three types of CP violation can occur in the quark sector: CP violation in the decay (also known as direct CP violation), CP violation in the mixing of neutral mesons, and CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay. Defining the amplitude of a B meson decaying to the final state f as A f , and that of its CP conjugateB to the CP conjugate final statef as\u0100f , direct CP violation occurs when |A f | = \u0100f . This is the only possible type of CP violation that can be observed in the decays of charged mesons and baryons, where mixing is not allowed for.

The 95% probability regions corresponding to each of the experimental measurements are indicated by filled areas of different colours. The various areas intersect in the position of the UT apex.  [42]. Each of these measurements yields a constraint on the position of the UT apex, i.e. on the values of the\u03c1 and\u03b7 parameters. Two independent groups, namely CKMfitter [51] and UTfit [45], regularly perform global CKM fits starting from the same set of experimental and theoretical inputs, but using different statistical approaches. In particular, CKMfitter performs a frequentist analysis, whereas UTfit follows a Bayesian method. Their latest results are displayed in Fig. 4. Each of the experimental constraints is represented as a 95% probability region by a filled area of different colour. The intersection of all regions identifies the position of the UT apex. The level of agreement amongst the various regions in pinpointing the UT apex is also a measure of the level of consistency of the KM mechanism with data. If (at least) one of the areas were not in agreement with the others, that would be an indication of the existence of BSM physics. At present, no striking evidence of any disagreement is found. The latest values of A, \u03bb,\u03c1 and\u03b7 obtained by the CKMfitter and UTfit groups are reported in Table 1. Besides small fluctuations, also stemming from slightly different theoretical inputs and statistical procedures, the two sets of results are in good agreement. has also been measured with a fully hadronic final state using the decay in the involved decay amplitudes and are given here for a maximum allowed breaking of 50%. This value of \u03b3 can be compared to that obtained from tree-dominated B \u2192 DK decays, where the CP -violating phase appears in the interference of the b \u2192 c and b \u2192 u topologies. The determination of \u03b3 from tree decays is considered free from contributions beyond the SM and unaffected by hadronic uncertainties. Yet, its precise measurement is important to test the consistency of the KM mechanism, also allowing for comparisons with measurements from modes dominated by penguin topologies. The most precise determination of \u03b3 from a single tree-level decay mode is achieved with the decay B + \u2192 DK + followed by D \u2192 K 0",

This measurement has triggered a lot of interest in the theoretical community, with interpretation articles being submitted very quickly to journals. See Refs. [108][109][110][111][112] for a small subset. It is not clear whether this discrepancy is an experimental fluctuation, is due to under-estimated form factor uncertainties (see Ref. [113]), or is the manifestation of a heavy Z boson, among many other suggested explanations. The contribution of cc resonances is also being questioned [114] after the LHCb observation of B + \u2192 \u03c8(4160)K + with \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [115], where the \u03c8(4160) and its interference with the non-resonant component accounts for 20% of the rate for dimuon masses above 3770 MeV/c 2 .

This fit correctly takes into account correlations between the input parameters. The CMS and LHCb experiments have very similar analysis strategies. B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates are selected as two oppositely charged tracks. A soft first selection is applied in order to reduce the background while keeping high the efficiency on the signal. After this selection, the remaining backgrounds are mainly due to random combinations of muons from semileptonic B decays (combinatorial background), semileptonic decays, such as B \u2192 h\u00b5\u03bd, B \u2192 h\u00b5\u00b5 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u00b5 \u2212\u03bd , and B 0 (s) \u2192 h + h \u2212 decays (peaking background) where hadrons are misidentified as muons. Further separation between signal and background is achieved exploiting the power of a multivariate classifier. The classification of the events is done using the dimuon invariant mass m \u00b5\u00b5 and the multivariate classifier output. The multivariate classifier is trained using kinematic and geometrical variables. The calibration of the dimuon mass m \u00b5\u00b5 is performed using the dimuon resonances and, for LHCb, also by using B 0 (s) \u2192 h + h \u2212 decays. For both analyses the B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 yield is normalised with respect to the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + yield, taking into account the hadronisation fractions of a b quark to B 0 s and B 0 mesons measured by the LHCb experiment [130][131][132].

The CMS and LHCb datasets are used together as in a single combined experiment. A simultaneous unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit is performed to the invariant mass spectrum in 20 categories of multivariate classifier output for the two experiments: 8 categories for LHCb and 12 categories for CMS. The various categories are characterised by construction by different values of signal purity. In each category the mass spectrum is described as the sum of each background source and the two signals. The parameters shared between the two experiments are the branching fractions of the two signal decays being looked for, B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), the already measured branching fraction of the common normalisation channel B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + ), and the ratio of the hadronisation fractions f s /f d .

The expected significances assuming the SM branching fractions are 7.4 \u03c3 and 0.8 \u03c3 for B 0 s and B 0 channels, respectively. Since the Wilks' theorem shows a B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal significance slightly above the 3 \u03c3 level, a more refined method based on the Feldman-Cousins construction [135] is also used for the B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode.

The ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments will be dominating heavy-flavour physics in the next decade, together with the forthcoming Belle II experiment, and even beyond with the high luminosity LHC phase. During Run I, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb have performed fundamental measurements in the field of CP violation and rare decays of B mesons. In this paper we have discussed some of these measurements, notably including that of the B 0 s -meson mixing phase from b \u2192 ccs decays, \u03d5 ccs s ; of the UT angle \u03b3 from tree-level decays; of B 0 and B 0 s semileptonic asymmetries; of angular observables in b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions; and of the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fraction, with the first observation of this decay at more than five standard deviations. No striking evidences of deviations from SM expectations have emerged from any of these measurements so far. However, they have enabled strong constraints to be set on many BSM models. The upcoming Run II, with its higher centre-of-mass energy translating into a higher bb cross-section, will witness substantial improvements in the study of B physics, and will hopefully lead to the observation of new physics phenomena not accounted for in the SM. Heavy flavour physics in the quark sector is not limited to beauty hadrons alone. The LHC is also an abundant source of charmed hadrons, which provide another interesting laboratory for BSM-physics searches. The recent experimental improvements in the measurement of mixing-related observables of D 0 mesons at LHCb have raised the interest for CP -violation measurements in this sector. Belle II and LHCb, with its upgraded detector that will be operational in the third LHC run, will probe CP violation in charm mixing with ultimate precision. The top quark is also another excellent tool for seeking BSM physics. The unprecedented samples collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments will enable relevant studies of CP violation in top-quark production and decays to be carried out.",
