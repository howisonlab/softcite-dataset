A new MC-based method of evaluating the covariance coefficients between isotopes was proposed. It was found that the covariance coefficients will varying with reactor burnup and which may change from positive to negative because of fissioning balance effect, for example, the covariance coefficient between 235 U and 239 Pu changes from 0.15 to -0.13. Using the equation between fission fraction and atomic density, the consistent of uncertainty of fission fraction and the covariance matrix were obtained. The antineutrino flux uncertainty is 0.55% which does not vary with reactor burnup, and the new value is about 8.3% smaller.",

            "text": "During the power cycle of a nuclear reactor, the composition of the fuel changes as Pu isotopes are bred and U isotopes are depleted. At the end of the power cycle, some fraction of the fuel is replaced, for example, Daya Bay reactor, one third of fuel will be replaced. The fresh fuel always stay in the reactor for three cycles in order to generate more power. Knowledge of the detailed time-depended of the content of the fuel is of interest to the reactor operator and designer for the safety consideration. To obtain this knowledge, reactor simulation code were developed such as DRAGON [2], Reactor Monte Carlo code (RMC) [3], CASMO,SCALE [4] and so on. The verification and validation of the code simulation was done by comparison of isotropic concentration with the experiment results. The fission fraction coefficients between isotopes [1] was approximately studied using 159 comparisons of fuel element samples taken from ten PWRs and BWRs, modeled by a variety of core simulation codes, because these isotopic concentration comparisons only give indirect information on the uncertainty in the number of fissions fraction. The correlation coefficients was also studied by using fission fraction of each isotopes directly [5]. However, for the next generation reactor antineutrino experiment (JUNO) which is aiming to perform high precision neutrino oscillation measurements, it is necessary to known more information about the uncertainty of fission fraction, such as, what is relation between the uncertainty of flux prediction caused by fission fraction and reacor burnup. Previous study can only give the burnup average fission fraction uncertainty, but not the information with burnup. In this study, this question was addressed by using a new MC-based method.",

There are 264 fuel rods, 24 control rods and one guide tub. The enrichment of new fuel is 4.45% for the 18-months reloaded design. An ordinary PWR pin cell with fuel enrichment of 4.45% was made and RMC code was used to simulate the atomic density and one group average cross section of each isotopes. Fig.1 shows the atomic density as a function burnup. The atomic densities of 235 U and 238 U are decreasing with the burnup increasing mainly because of fission and capture reactions. On the other hands, the atomic densities of 239 Pu and 241 Pu are increasing with the burnup increasing mainly because of transmutation from 238 U. Fig.2 shows the one group average cross sections of each isotopes as a function of burnup. The one group average cross sections of 238 U is increasing with the burnup increasing because that the fission cross sections 238 U is increasing with the energy increasing, and the neutron spectrum becoming more harder at the end of three cycles, which causes the average of the neutron increasing. The one group average cross sections of 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu are decreasing with the burnup increasing because the fission cross sections of above two isotopes decreasing with neutron energy increasing.",

Macroscopic fission cross section uncertainty analysis were studied using TSUNAMI-2D sequence in SCALE6.1. It was found that the fission cross section uncertainty of PWR is less than 0.36% [7]. However, the statical uncertainty of the one group average cross section of each isotopes is less than 0.1% when doing the simulation using RMC. Considering the conservative of the results, the value 0.36% was adopted as the standard deviation of the one group average cross section of each isotopes.

The correlation coefficients as a function of burnup were evaluated as shown in Table 1. The correlation coefficients are varying with burnup linearly. On the other hands, some correlation coefficients may change its sign, for example, the correlation coefficients of ( 238 U, 239 Pu) and ( 239 Pu, 241 Pu) changes from positive to negative. There are two reasons which would cause that results. One is decay chain, for example, the correlation coefficients of ( 238 U, 239 Pu) would be a positive because that 238 U will be transmutation to 239 Pu after absorption one neutron and then decaying two times. This effect could be called positive effect. Otherwise, the over fissioning of 239 Pu must be accompanied by an under-fissioning of the other isotopes which include 238 U, and which would be an negative effect. The results the correlation coefficient is positive or negative effect can be explained by which effect will dominate the process. For instance, at the begin of cycle, the positive effect is more important than the negative effect, the correlation coefficients of ( 238 U, 239 Pu) is positive.

            "text": "A new MC-based method of evaluating the covariance matrix between isotopes was proposed. The method has the capability of considering the uncertainty of atomic density and microscopic cross section at the same time and evaluating the covariance coefficient varying with burnup. We find that the covariance coefficient may change from positive to negative because of fissioning balance effects. This fact would cause the uncertainty of fission fraction having a little larger. Using the equation between fission fraction and atomic density, the consistent of uncertainty of fission fraction and the covariance matrix were studied. The antineutrino flux uncertainty is 0.55% which does not vary with reactor burnup, and the new value is about 8.3% smaller.",
