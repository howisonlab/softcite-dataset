The measurement of the top-quark mass m t , a fundamental parameter of the standard model (SM), has received particular attention, since m t , the mass of the W boson, M W , and the mass of the Higgs boson are related through radiative corrections that provide an internal consistency check of the SM [3]. Furthermore, m t dominantly affects the stability of the SM Higgs potential, which has cosmological implications [4][5][6].",

The analysis focuses on tt events identified in +jets final states with representing either an electron or a muon. This includes contributions from leptonic \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd \u03c4 decays. The top and antitop quark are assumed to always decay into a W boson and a b quark [10]. Thus, at leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), one of the W bosons in the W + W \u2212 bb final state decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino, while the other decays into a pair of quarks, and all four quarks (qq bb) evolve into jets. Such +jets events are characterized by an isolated electron or muon with large transverse momentum p T , a large imbalance in transverse momentum caused by the undetected neutrino, and four high-p T jets. We exploit this distinct signature in the event selection to discriminate tt events from background.",

In the present measurement, we use not only a larger data sample to improve the statistical precision, but also refine the estimation of systematic uncertainties, resulting in a reduction of the uncertainty by 50%. This improvement is achieved through an updated detector calibration, in particular through improvements to b quark JES corrections [15], and through the use of recent improvements in modeling the tt signal. In the following, we point out the most important improvements of this analysis with respect to the previous measurement. The analysis is performed \"blinded\", i.e., with no reference to the resulting m t , until the final approval of the analysis methodology.",

This is followed in Section VI by the description of the measurement of the signal fraction f in data using the ME technique, including its calibration. The measurement of m t and the calibration of the response of the ME technique in m t is discussed in Section VII. After describing the evaluation of systematic uncertainties in Section VIII, we compare our measurement with previous results in Section IX, and conclude and give the final result with statistical and systematic uncertainties in Section X.

The absolute contribution of this background to each of the e+jets and \u00b5+jets final states is estimated using the \"matrix method,\" described in Ref. [34]. This method uses the number of events with leptons originating from the hard interaction, N tt,W loose , and from MJ production, N MJ loose , both with less restrictive lepton-identification criteria, and relates them to the contributions to the sample of events that fulfil standard lepton identification criteria. This is calculated using the relation N = \u03b5 tt,W N tt,W loose + \u03b5 MJ N MJ loose , where \u03b5 tt,W and \u03b5 MJ represent the efficiency of events that pass the loosened lepton identification criteria to also pass the standard identification criteria.

The distribution is generated with a mass of the top quark of m gen t = 172.5 GeV. The mass m tt is constructed using p / T as an initial estimate for p \u03bd T of the neutrino, assuming M W = 80.4 GeV, and solving the resulting quadratic equation for p \u03bd z . When no solution exists, p \u03bd T is scaled to obtain a solution. The resulting neutrino momentum is then combined with the momenta of the four jets and the charged lepton to obtain m tt . The invariant mass, M W , of the two jets that match one of the W bosons is presented in Fig. 27 (a) and (b) in Section VII C. The reconstruction of M W in Fig. 27 is unique for events with two b-tagged jets, as the two other jets are assigned to the W boson. If only one jet is b-tagged, all possible assignments of jets to partons in the LO approximation of tt decays are tried, and the one yielding the smallest value of |m t \u2212 mt | is retained. If the b-tagged jet is matched to the top quark decaying into three jets, the two untagged jets matched to the same top quark form the W boson. If all three jets that are matched to this top quark are not b-tagged, the two lowest p T jets are matched to the W boson. A similar matching algorithm is used if there are more than two b-tagged jets. The uncertainties in the predictions include the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty that change the shape of the kinematic distributions: JES, jet energy resolution, jet identification, flavor dependence of the detector response, b tagging, lepton identification, lepton momentum scale, trigger, as well as hadronization and higher-order effects for simulated tt events. Good agreement is observed between data and simulations. We verify that the agreement improves using the values for the signal fraction f , m t , and k JES measured in this analysis, as shown in Section VII C.",

The function P sig describes the PD for tt production, while P bkg describes the PD for W + jets production. W + jets events, i.e., the sum of W + hf and W + lf categories in Table 2, represent the dominant background contribution of 14% in the e+jets and 20% in the \u00b5 +jets final states, derived with the normalization procedure described in Section IV. The next-to-dominant background contribution is from MJ events. It is accounted for in P evt through P bkg , since W + jets and MJ production have similar PDs in the selected kinematic region. The similarity of PDs for W +jets and MJ production can be understood in that the main difference between the two processes arises from the presence of the W boson in the W + jets production, while an energetic jet which is misidentified as an isolated lepton is present in MJ production. At the same time, both processes are characterized by the presence of four additional jets, which, together with the W boson for W + jets production or the jet misidentified as an isolated lepton for MJ production, set a similar momentum-transfer scale of the hard interaction process. The effect of including MJ production through P bkg is accounted for by the calibration procedure outlined in Sections VI and VII. The combined contribution from all other backgrounds amounts to about 6% in both final states (cf. Table 2), and is therefore not included in the calculation of P evt .",

For b tagged jets, w j i is equal to the per-jet tagging efficiency \u03b5 tag (\u03b1 k ; E j T , \u03b7 j ), where \u03b1 k labels the configurations where the jet is assigned to either (i) a b quark, (ii) a c quark, or (iii) a u, d, s quark or gluon.

To avoid potential bias from the kinematic selections, all the requirements described in Section IV are applied at detector level, except for having exactly four jets, at least one of which is b-tagged, and except the p T threshold for the jets, which is lowered to 15 GeV. The parameters a i and b i are extracted from MC generated tt events with m t values ranging between 150 and 190 GeV, for each data-taking epoch. We use an unbinned likelihood fit that maximizes the product of the W jet terms for all jets in all events as a function of a i and b i . Separate sets of a i and b i parameters are derived for three categories of jets: (i) from light quarks (u, d, s) and charm, (ii) from b quarks with a muon of a relatively low p T within the jet cone (soft muon tag), and (iii) for all other b quarks. This is done for four regions of \u03b7: |\u03b7| \u2264 0.4, 0.4 < |\u03b7| \u2264 0.8, 0.8 < |\u03b7| \u2264 1.6, and 1.6 < |\u03b7| \u2264 2.5 to take into account the \u03b7 dependence of the detector response. These same four regions are used to derive the correction for the flavor-dependence of the detector response to jets [15]. When deriving the TF, the matching of jets to partons is performed using a simple cone-matching algorithm, where a jet is considered uniquely matched to a parton if \u2206R(jet, closest parton) < R cone /2 = 0.25. The cone-matching parameter is chosen to maximize the matching efficiency, while minimizing the mismatching rate of quarks to jets from pile up. The probability of a detector-level jet not to be matched to a particle-level jet is 2% per jet. Figure 4 illustrates the TF for jets from category (i) as a function of E x for different values of E y for Run IIb2, which is representative of all four data-taking epochs. The TF for jets from category (ii) is shown in Fig. 5, and for category (iii) in Fig. 6. The values of the a i and b i parameters for each of the four data-taking epochs are summarized in Appendix B. To verify that the TF describes the detector response to jets, we use fully simulated tt MC events with all jet energy corrections and smearing needed to match resolutions in data. They must pass all selections summarized in Section IV, and each of the four jets needs to be uniquely matched to a quark. In  Fig. 7 we compare the distributions in the invariant mass of the dijet system that matches the two quarks from the W \u2192 qq decay, and the invariant mass of those two quarks, smeared with the jet TF. We compare the distributions in the invariant mass of the trijet system matched to one of the top quarks and the corresponding quarks smeared with the jet TF in Fig. 8. Both tests indicate that the jet TF well describe the jet resolutions. Any residual disagreements are taken into account through the calibration procedures, described in Sections VI A and VII A.",

We refine the calibration procedure relative to that of Ref.

Since the detector response, and therefore its parametrization, changes between data-taking epochs and final states, this calibration is obtained for each epoch and final state.",

Since the background contribution from MJ production is modeled using data, it is not changed for different generated  Fig. 11 for the e+jets and in Fig. 12 for the \u00b5 +jets final states, together with the offset and slope of the linear fits. The response in m t is close to the ideal case of no offset and unit slope. At m gen t = 172.5 GeV, which is close to the current world average of m t = 173.34 GeV [9], the difference between the obtained and ideal response in m t is \u2248 0.5 GeV, i.e., at the level of \u2248 0.25% -a very good performance given that a LO ME with parameterized detector response is used in the ME calculation. We verify that the ideal response of the ME technique is retained through ensemble studies using parton-level tt events generated with PYTHIA using a LO ME. In a similar fashion, we obtain a lin- ear parametrization of the response of the ME technique in k JES , as shown in Fig. 13 for the e+jets and in Fig. 14 for the \u00b5+jets final states.

To evaluate the contribution from this source, we adjust the amount of radiation by changing the ktfac parameter [64] that defines the renormalization scale in the CKKW scale-setting procedure, from its standard value of ktfac = 1 in our ALPGEN+PYTHIA simulations described in Section III, as suggested in Ref. [64]. We constrain changes in the amount of ISR/FSR by studying the cross section for Drell-Yan events (qq \u2192 Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 ) measured differentially in the \u03c6 * variable [65], which is related to the p T of the Z/\u03b3 * boson, and has sensitivity to the amount of QCD radiation. Our studies, documented in Appendix A, indicate that changes in the ktfac parameter by a factor of \u00b11.5 cover the excursion of MC simulations from data, which results in an uncertainty of \u22130.06 GeV on m t . Previously, the systematic uncertainty from modeling of ISR/FSR was evaluated using a pure LO generator, PYTHIA, and changes made in shower-evolution parameters. The new procedure is more accurate, as it uses a larger data sample for deriving the ISR/FSR dependence, and employs the same generator setup as for simulating the default tt sample.",

To evaluate the CR effect, we compare identical ALPGEN events interfaced to PYTHIA with two different tunes, Perugia 2011 and Perugia 2011NOCR. While the former tune includes an explicit CR model, the latter does not. The Perugia 2011 tune rather than Perugia 2011C is used as an alternative model because Perugia 2011 uses the same set of CTEQ5L PDFs as the reference model Perugia 2011NOCR, while Perugia 2011C uses CTEQ6L1. This choice of generator setup is advised in Ref. [68], since Perugia includes a better, more phenomenologically-motivated CR model than the ACRpro tune [70]. The new tune models the color-string survival probability depending on the distance in rapidity between the beginning and the end of the color string, whereas the previous model uses only an overall approximation.

A single constant offset is added to the parameterization across all four \u03b7 bins, such that the average correction applied to the energies of all the jets in the sample is zero to avoid double-counting of acceptance effects.

The correction F corr is largest for b-quark jets and gluon jets, and is relatively small for light quark jets, compared to the flavor-averaged JES, as shown in Fig. 34 of Ref. [15]. We are in a position to apply such a correction in a straightforward way, since the JES is corrected to particle level both for data and MC. To propagate the effect of the uncertainty on F corr to our measured m t value, we change F corr by \u00b11 SD for each data-taking epoch and final state. We apply this factor to the jets in our signal MC samples to get alternative calibrations, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of \u22130.16 GeV after symmetrization.

Thus, the preferred approach is to change the amount of ISR/FSR through rescaling of the renormalization scale in the CKKW scale-setting procedure ktfac from its default of unity, as suggested in Ref. [64]. Our studies indicate that changing the ktfac parameter by a factor of \u00b11.5 provide coverage for the excursions of the nominal MC predictions from the data. This is demonstrated in Fig. 35 for the e + e \u2212 and in Fig. 36 for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final states. Based on these studies, we evaluate the systematic uncertainty from ISR/FSR in tt events by setting the ktfac parameter to 2/3 for the up and 3/2 for the down point.                ",

Jet flavor is denoted as \"light jets\" for u, d, c, s quark jets, \"b \u00b5 jets\" for b-quark jets with a soft muon tag, and \"b jets\" for all other b-quark jets. The parameter a 3 is fixed to 0 in order to improve the convergence of the double-Gaussian fit function. The parameter values are given in units of GeV (a 1 ), 1 (b 1 ), GeV (a 2 ), 1 (b 2 ), 1 (a 3 ), GeV \u22121 (b 3 ), GeV (a 4 ), 1 (b 4 ), GeV (a 5 ), and 1 (b 5 ).",
