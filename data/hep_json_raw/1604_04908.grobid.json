The scale and geometry of the apparatus enables a search for new forces that appear at distances below 100 \u00b5m and which would have evaded previous searches due to screening mechanisms. The data are consistent with electrostatic backgrounds and place upper limits on the strength of new interactions at < 0.1 fN in the geometry tested. For the specific example of a chameleon interaction with an inverse power law potential, these results exclude matter couplings \u03b2 > 5.6 \u00d7 10 4 in the region of parameter space where the self-coupling \u039b 5 meV and the microspheres are not fully screened.",

This acceleration can be explained by the presence of 'dark energy' throughout the universe [4]. Although the nature of dark energy is unknown, one possibility is that it consists of a scalar field that couples to mass [5,6]. Astrophysical measurements of the dark energy density imply an energy scale of \u039b = 2.4 meV, corresponding to a length scale of c/\u039b \u223c 80 \u00b5m.",

In many cases, the resulting forces can be substantially larger than Newtonian gravity at short distances [6,9]. The most sensitive previous searches for violations of Newtonian gravity at or below the dark energy length scale employed macroscopic test masses or a conductive shield between the probe and test masses to minimize electromagnetic backgrounds [8,[10][11][12][13]. Although these experiments place stringent constraints on deviations from Newtonian gravity, it is possible to construct theories of dark energy involving new forces that could have avoided detection due to the geometry and scale of previous experiments [6,9,14,15]. For these screened interactions, recent searches using microscopic test masses such as atoms [16,17] or neutrons [18][19][20] often provide the strongest constraints.",

A specific example is the chameleon mechanism [21,22], in which the effective mass of the chameleon particle (corresponding to the inverse length scale of the interaction) depends on the local matter density. At cosmological distances where the matter density is low, the chameleon field would mediate a long range interaction that explains the accelerating expansion of the universe [23]. However, most laboratory experiments are carried out in regions of high matter density, where the forces arising from the chameleon interaction are suppressed. This work presents a search for screened interactions below the dark energy length scale using optically levitated \u00b5m-size dielectric spheres as test masses. Levitated microspheres in high vacuum [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] can be used to detect forces 10 \u221218 N [30, [33][34][35][36], and in many cases their small size avoids screening effects.",

The radiation pressure from the laser counters Earth's gravity and acts as an optical spring pulling the microsphere to the center of the Gaussian beam [39]. The resonant frequencies of the trap are \u223c 150 Hz for the 2 degrees-of-freedom orthogonal to the Earth's gravity and \u223c 100 Hz for the degree-of-freedom parallel to Earth's gravity. The position of the microsphere is measured by focusing secondary 650 nm Gaussian laser beams on the microsphere and imaging the pattern of scattered light onto a position-sensitive photodiode (PSPD). For small dis-placements from the center of the trap, the PSPD produces a differential current that is a linear function of the position of the microsphere.",

The \u03c7 2 statistic at the best fit point and for the background only model indicates that both provide a good fit to the data. At the best fit point, \u03c7 2 = 97.8 for 87 DOF, while for the background only model \u03c7 2 = 98.9 for 88 DOF.

One method for reducing such backgrounds is to spin the microspheres by applying an optical [45] or electrostatic torque [46]. It might be possible to anneal the microspheres in situ [47] to increase the rate at which separated charges within the microspheres recombine. Finally, commercially available microspheres made from different materials might have smaller permanent dipole moments.
