The cross-section is measured in a fiducial region where both leptons have a transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV and a pseudorapidity between 2.0 and 4.5. The quadrature sum of the azimuthal separation and the difference in pseudorapidities, denoted \u2206R, between the two leptons must be larger than 0.1. The b-jet axis is required to be separated from both leptons by a \u2206R of 0.5, and to have a transverse momentum in excess of 20 GeV and a pseudorapidity between 2.2 and 4.2. The cross-section is measured to be \u03c3 tt = 126 \u00b1 19 (stat) \u00b1 16 (syst) \u00b1 5 (lumi) fb where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the luminosity determination. The measurement is compatible with the Standard Model prediction.",

            "text": "The production of top quarks at hadron colliders represents an important test of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle and its production and decay properties are sensitive to a number of scenarios beyond the Standard Model. The unique forward acceptance of the LHCb detector allows measurements in a phase space inaccessible to general purpose detectors such as ATLAS and CMS. Top-quark production in this region receives a higher contribution from quarkantiquark (qq) annihilation than in the central region and probes higher values of Bjorken-x, where large uncertainties are present in the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs). Precise measurements of top quark production at LHCb can thus be used to constrain PDFs in this region [1]. The greater contribution from quark-initiated production also results in a larger expected charge asymmetry [2,3] in the forward region than in the central region.",

Additionally, this final state does not differentiate between single top quark and top quark pair production.

The increased energy leads to an increase of a factor of ten in the tt production cross-section within the LHCb acceptance with respect to collisions at a energy of 8 TeV [8]. The larger cross-section allows access to a number of final states inaccessible in Run 1, including the dilepton final state, where both top quarks decay to a W boson and a b quark, and the W bosons decay leptonically to a lepton and a neutrino. This paper details the first measurement of tt production in the \u00b5eb final state at LHCb, where the dilepton channel is partially reconstructed by requiring that a muon, an electron and a b-jet are present in the proton-proton (pp) collision, where the leptons are produced by the W boson decay, either directly or through the decay of a tau lepton. This final state yields a high purity with respect to other final states; the selection of two leptons reduces the background from single W -boson production and lepton mis-identification, the choice of different flavour leptons suppresses the contribution from the production of Z bosons, and the b-tagged jet reduces the contribution from light jets.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 1 The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. In this paper, the presence of a muon is used to select candidate events at both stages of JHEP08(2018)174 the trigger; the hardware stage selects muons with a transverse momentum p T > 1.76 GeV and the subsequent software trigger requires that a muon with p T > 12 GeV is present.",

Muons are identified as reconstructed tracks that are matched to hits in each of the four muon stations furthest downstream, while electrons are identified as tracks that have left large energy deposits in the preshower detector and electromagnetic calorimeter, in addition to small energy deposits in the hadronic calorimeter. The muons and electrons are required to have p T in excess of 20 GeV, a pseudorapidity in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5, and to be separated by a distance, \u2206R, of greater than 0.1 in (\u03b7,\u03c6) space, where \u03c6 refers to the azimuthal angle. The reconstructed final state particles used as inputs to the jet building are prepared using a particle flow algorithm and clustered using the anti-k T algorithm as implemented in Fastjet [25], with a distance parameter of 0.5. Requirements are placed on the candidate jet in order to reduce the background formed by particles which are either incorrectly reconstructed or produced in additional pp interactions in the same event. The jet is required to have p T above 20 GeV and a pseudorapidity between 2.2 and 4.2. Separation between the jet and each lepton is ensured by requiring that the \u2206R distance between the jet and the leptons is greater than 0.5. A dedicated tagging algorithm is used to select b-jets. The tagger proceeds by building two-body secondary vertices (SVs) using all tracks not associated to any PV in the event, and merging any vertices sharing a common track. A jet is said to be tagged if the event contains an SV with a flight direction satisfying \u2206R < 0.5 with respect to the jet axis, where the flight direction is taken to be the vector joining the SV to the primary vertex.

This cross-section is compared to the theoretical predictions obtained from aMC@NLO, POWHEG and MCFM. Three different sources of uncertainty are considered on the theoretical predictions: uncertainties due to the description of the PDFs (\u03b4 PDF ), the uncertainty due to the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales (\u03b4 scale ), and the uncertainty on the value of the strong coupling constant used in the calculation (\u03b4 \u03b1s ). The uncertainty due to the choice of the top quark mass is expected to be small and is not considered further. The total theoretical uncertainty, \u03b4 theory , is determined by combining the individual uncertainties according to the formula \u03b4 theory = \u03b4 2 PDF + \u03b4 2 \u03b1s + \u03b4 scale [30]. A comparison of the measured cross-section with the predictions is shown in figure 5. The result is shown in the case where the fiducial requirements are placed on the final state muon, electron and b-jet, and where the fiducial requirements are placed on the top quarks, where the top quarks are defined at parton level after QCD radiation. The latter fiducial region requires that both top quarks have a rapidity between 2.0 and 5.0. The measured cross-section in the top quark fiducial region is obtained by extrapolating from the measured fiducial region using predictions from aMC@NLO, which contributes an additional 1.5% uncertainty to the measurement uncertainty, evaluated using the same techniques as for the theoretical predictions described earlier. The cross-section in the top quark fiducial region is additionally compared to predictions from MCFM. The measured cross-section in both fiducial regions is seen to be in agreement with the predictions. A summary of the systematic uncertainties contributing to the measurement is given in table 2. The dominant systematic uncertainty is due to the knowledge of the jet tagging efficiency.  Figure 5.

            "text": "The cross-section for top quark pair production in the forward region at LHCb has been measured using the \u00b5eb final state, where the presence of a muon, electron and b-jet are used to identify tt candidates. The cross-section is measured in two fiducial regions: where fiducial requirements are placed on the final state objects, and where fiducial requirements are placed on the top quarks themselves. The latter fiducial cross-section is obtained by scaling the former by an extrapolation factor obtained from aMC@NLO. The measurement precision of 20% is comparable to prior measurements of top quark production at LHCb in Run 1 and to the precision of the theoretical predictions. The measurement uncertainty is dominated by the statistical precision of the data sample and the knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency. The final state presented here is selected with a high purity with respect to measurements in other final states. While a number of systematic uncertainties contributing to the measurement are uncorrelated with measurements in other final states, future reductions of the uncertainty on the b-tagging efficiency, common to all final states, will be required in order to fully exploit their complementarity. With the increase in the data-taking capabilities of the LHCb detector in future upgrades [31,32], measurements in the \u00b5eb final state will no longer be statistically limited, and have the potential to achieve the highest precision on the measurement of the tt production cross-section at LHCb.",
