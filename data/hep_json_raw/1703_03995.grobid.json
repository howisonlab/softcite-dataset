            "text": "A number of extensions of the standard model (SM) have been proposed that predict an enhanced production rate for events containing pairs of quarks and pairs of third-generation leptons. One such theoretical proposal involves the existence of particles called leptoquarks (LQs), which carry color charge, fractional electric charge, and both lepton and baryon quantum numbers. The LQs arise in many models, including grand unified theories [1], compositeness models [2,3], and superstring theories [4]. If LQs exist, they will decay into a lepton and a quark. At the CERN LHC, LQ pairs are predominantly produced via gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation. Based on the latest experimental constraints reviewed in [5], we assume that contribution of t-channel production of LQ pairs involving Yukawa coupling of a LQ, a lepton, and a quark, is small and neglected in this analysis and the main free parameter is the mass of LQ. However, the branching fraction for the decay of a LQ into a quark and a charged lepton, \u03b2, depends on the details of the model under consideration. In this analysis we focus on the decay of a pair of third-generation LQs resulting in two \u03c4 leptons and two jets originating from b quark fragmentation.",

One of the appealing features of left-right (L-R) symmetric extensions [6] of the SM is that these models predict the existence of new heavy charged (W R ) and neutral (Z R ) gauge bosons that could be produced at LHC JHEP07 (2017)121energies. Heavy neutrinos (N e , N \u00b5 , N \u03c4 ) naturally arise as the right-handed (RH) partners of the SM neutrinos in these L-R extensions through the see-saw mechanism [7].",

A search for pair production of third-generation scalar LQs is pursued by looking for events containing two \u03c4 leptons and two b quarks. We also search for the production of a W R boson from quarkantiquark annihilation. A heavy right-handed neutrino is produced from the decay of the W R boson following the decay chain W R \u2192 \u03c4 + N \u03c4 , where N \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + W * R \u2192 \u03c4 + qq. In both searches, we focus on signatures with one of the \u03c4 leptons decaying into an electron or a muon, referred to as a leptonic decay \u03c4 in the following, and the other \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically, denoted by \u03c4 h .",

The most stringent lower limit on the mass of scalar third-generation LQs to date, based on the final state with two \u03c4 leptons and two b jets and assuming \u03b2 = 1, is 740 GeV at 95% confidence level (CL), from the CMS experiment [10,11]. Previous searches for heavy neutrinos have been performed at LEP [12,13], excluding heavy neutrino masses below approximately 100 GeV. Further searches at LHC have been performed in the dielectron and dimuon channels and have excluded W R bosons with mass up to 3 TeV using data taken at 7 TeV [14] and at 8 TeV [15]. Using 2.1 fb \u22121 of data of 13 TeV pp collisions collected in 2015, the CMS experiment searched for heavy neutrinos and right-handed charged bosons using events in which both \u03c4 leptons decay hadronically. That analysis excluded W R bosons with masses below 2.35 (1.63) TeV at 95% CL, assuming the N \u03c4 mass is 0.8 (0.2) times the mass of W R boson [11]. In the present search, we use a \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector in 2016.",

The signal samples are normalized to the next-to-next-toleading order [18,19]. The W R signal samples are generated with W R boson masses ranging from 1000 to 4000 GeV in steps of 500 GeV and the cross sections are computed in ref. [20]. The MadGraph v5.1.5 generator [21] is used to model W+jets and Z+jets processes. Single top production and tt process are modelled with the powheg 2.0 [22][23][24] generator. The NNPDF 3.0 [25] Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) are used, and all simulated samples are interfaced with pythia with the CUETP8M1 tune [26] to describe parton showering and hadronization. Additional inelastic pp interactions (pileup) generated by pythia are overlaid on all simulated events, according to the luminosity profile of the analyzed data. All the generated signal and background samples are processed with the simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4 [27]. Small differences between data and simulation in trigger, in particle identification and isolation efficiencies, and in the resolution of the p T of jets and missing transverse momentum are corrected by applying scale factors to simulated events, as detailed below.",

The \u03c4 h identification efficiency [33,46] is measured in bins of \u03c4 h candidate p T in Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd events and fitted by a linear function within the range 20 to 200 GeV. The uncertainty in the \u03c4 h identification efficiency measurement is 6% for \u03c4 leptons from the decay of Z bosons. The extrapolation to higher transverse momenta is taken into account by adding an uncertainty that increases linearly with p T and has a value of 20% for a p T of 200 GeV. This uncertainty has a direct effect on the S T distribution and hence is considered as a shape uncertainty. Changes in the acceptance due to the uncertainty in the b tagging efficiency and in the mistag rate are measured to be between 3 and 5%, depending on the process. The uncertainty in the normalization of the tt background due to the PDF and scale uncertainties amounts to 5% [47,48]. A 10% uncertainty is attributed to the Z boson background estimate, while the uncertainty in both the diboson and single top background estimates amounts to 15% [49]. The uncertainty in the yield of QCD multijet and W+jet backgrounds amounts to 30%. The uncertainty in the signal acceptance due to the choice of the PDF set in the simulated sample is evaluated -6 -",

The uncertainty in the \u03c4 h ES amounts to 3% [33]. The uncertainty in the jet ES affects the p T spectrum of the jets and consequently p miss T , and is applied to signal and all backgrounds that are estimated with MC simulation [54]. The uncertainties in the electron, muon, and p miss T ES have a negligible effect on the S T distribution. The uncertainty in the top quark p T reweighting correction is derived by changing the event weight between zero and twice the nominal reweighting correction value [42,43].

            "text": "Searches have been performed for third-generation scalar leptoquarks and for heavy righthanded neutrinos in events containing one electron or muon, one hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton, and two or more jets, using pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb \u22121 . The data are found to be in good agreement with the standard model prediction in both analyses. A limit at 95% confidence level is set on the product of the leptoquark pair production cross section and \u03b2 2 , where \u03b2 denotes the branching fraction for the decay of the leptoquark into a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark. Assuming \u03b2 = 1, third-generation leptoquarks with masses below 850 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. In the heavy RH neutrino analysis, considering the decay W R \u2192 \u03c4 N R and assuming the mass of the heavy neutrino to be half the mass of the W R boson, we exclude W R boson masses below 2.9 TeV at 95% confidence level. These are the best mass limits to date for third-generation leptoquarks and heavy right-handed neutrinos with \u03c4 leptons in the final state.  Figure 3. Observed and expected limits at 95% CL on the product of cross section and branching fraction, obtained from the combination of the e\u03c4 h and \u00b5\u03c4 h channels in the heavy right-handed neutrino analysis (left) and the observed and expected limits at 95% CL on the production cross section as a function of M WR and M NR (right). The green and yellow bands represent the one and two standard deviation uncertainties in the expected limits. The dashed dark blue curve represents the theoretical prediction for the product of the W R boson production cross section and the branching fraction for decay to a \u03c4 lepton and RH neutrino, assuming the mass of the RH neutrino to be half the mass of the W R boson [20].",

A hypothetical LQ signal of mass M LQ = 900 GeV and a hypothetical heavy W R signal of mass M WR = 3 TeV are overlaid to illustrate the sensitivity. The electroweak background represents the sum of W boson, Z boson, and diboson production. The last bin of each plot contains overflow events. A binned maximum likelihood fit is performed on the S T distribution. The uncertainty bands represent the sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic uncertainties, obtained from the fit.
