In pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, azimuthal correlations in dijets separated in rapidity by up to 9.4 units were measured. The results are compared to BFKL-and DGLAP-based Monte Carlo generator and analytic predictions. In pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, cross sections for jets with p T > 21 GeV and |y| < 4.7, and for track-jets with p T > 1 GeV (minijets) are presented. The minijet results are sensitive to the bound imposed by the total inelastic cross section, and are compared to various models for taming the growth of the 2 \u2192 2 cross section at low p T .",

            "text": "Hard parton-parton interactions occurring during hadron collisions can be described in the theory of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Hadronic jets, collimated streams of particles carrying information about partons produced in the hard interaction, are particularly useful probes for studies of QCD. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading (NLO) order accuracy, using the collinear factorisation framework and Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations are well-tested tools describing inclusive jet or dijet production. Measurements of correlations of jets within the same event are sensitive to higher order pQCD radiation (or parton showers), which is taken into account in analytic calculations by the resummation procedure. The DGLAP equations account for such radiation to all orders of perturbation theory for hard parton collisions ( \u221a s \u223c p T \u039b QCD ). At high centre-of-mass energies a kinematical domain can be reached where semi-hard parton interactions ( \u221a s p T \u039b QCD ) play a substantial role. Perturbative QCD resummation in the asymptotic region, where \u221a s \u2192 \u221e, is performed by the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation.",

Measurement of the low-p T jet integrated cross-section [1] probes transition from perturbative non-perturbative QCD domain. Low-p T jet spectrum measurement [2] allows testing of fixed order pQCD calculations. Finally correlations between jets widely separated in rapidity [3,4] probes phase space region where pQCD resummation techniques are particularly important for data description. Therefore it provides testing ground for different parton shower models and analytic calculations.",

            "text": "Most of the final state hadrons produced in proton-proton interactions at LHC energies come from \"semi-hard\" interactions where exchange momenta is small (O(1 \u2212 3)GeV). At low p T the cross-section for hadron production is becoming very large and eventually total integrated cross-section \u03c3 (p T,min ) = p T,min d p 2 T d\u03c3 /p 4 T overcomes the total proton-proton inelastic cross-section. In [7] it was proposed to measure the small-p T jet cross-section integrated over the p T,min as a probe for the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD domain. Measurement [1] was performed with data recorded at collision energy of 8 TeV in common data-taking with TOTEM experiment [8] in a dedicated LHC run with very low number of overlapping collisions (\u223c 5.4% on average). T2 telescope of TOTEM detector provides tracking in 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5 region. Events were selected with trigger requiring at least 1 track with p T > 40 MeV in T2 acceptance. Analysed data corresponds to 45 \u00b5b \u22121 . Jets with p T > 1 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.9 clustered from charged hadrons reconstructed with tracking detector were selected for the analysis. Integrated jet cross-section was measured in the range 1 < p T,min < 40 (GeV). Measured cross section was normalised to total cross-section of production of jets satisfying selection criteria. Results of the measurement are presented at Fig. 1. Taming of the cross section for low p T,min is observed. Measured cross section was compared to predictions of various Monte Carlo (MC) models. It was observed that the shape of integrated cross section distribution as obtained from data is well-described by cosmic ray MC EPOS [9]. While well-known MC PYTHIA, HERWIG and other fail to describe the taming of the cross section. Analogous analysis discussed in [1] is made for leading track objects. It has similar conclusions. The measurement of inclusive production of jets [2] was performed with 5.8 pb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded in special low pileup LHC runs during the summer of 2012. The production cross section was measured in bins of transverse momentum, p T , in the rapidity range of |y| < 4.7. The total experimental uncertainty does not exceed 50%, with the leading contribution being due to the jet energy scale calibration. The results of the measurement for the very forward region of the detector are shown in Fig. 2, in addition to a combination of the described measurement with the inclusive jet production cross section measured over the full 8 TeV dataset [10] is presented. The results of the measurement were compared to the predictions of NLO pQCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects. The theoretical predictions agree with the measurements within the wide range of p T and rapidity.  ",

In case of a significant contribution of semi-hard scattering in pp collisions at a given energy a strong rise of the inclusive dijet production cross section with increasing rapidity interval, \u2206y, is expected due to increased higher order parton radiation. Earlier CMS result probing higher order radiation in Mueller-Navelet jet production is inclusive to exclusive dijet production ratio measured as a function of rapidity separation between jets [3]. DGLAP-based PYTHIA Monte Carlo predictions demonstrate good agreement with the data in that work. Another probe of higher order radiation is azimuthal decorrelation of jets within dijet pairs. Azimuthal decorrelation measured as a function of rapidity separation between jets may reveal effects beyond the DGLAP description.",

The following quantities were measured as a function of \u2206y in the work [4]: C n = cos(n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 )) , where \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6 1 \u2212 \u03c6 2 is the difference between the azimuthal angles \u03c6 1 and \u03c6 2 of the jets most forward and backward in rapidity and n = 1, 2, 3. A measurement of C 1 was first performed by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron [12]. Later it was proposed that the ratios of coefficients C 2 /C 1 and C 3 /C 2 are observables more sensitive to BFKL contributions [13]. In this report a first measurement of cosine ratios is discussed, in addition to C n . Analysis was performed with pp collisions taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV in 2010. An effective integrated luminosity of 5 pb \u22121 was available for the measurement. Average cosines of the azimuthal angle difference were measured in bins of of rapidity separation between the jets, \u2206y. Jets with p T > 35 GeV and |y| < 4.7 were considered. Measured observables corrected for detector effects are compared to predictions of various MC and to analytic next-to-leading logarithmic approximation (NLL) BFKL calculations [14]. It should be noted that improved NLL BFKL calculations, including a comparison to the CMS data, were released after the present measurement was published [15]. The leading source of experimental uncertainty in the measurement is the jet energy scale calibration, which constitutes up to 24% depending on observable and rapidity separation range. The total experimental uncertainty does not exceed 25%. The measured average cosines and cosine ratios are shown in Fig. 3. DGLAP-based MC generators (PYTHIA6, HERWIG++ and SHERPA) do not describe all observables within the experimental uncertainty. The NLL BFKL calculations describe well the cosine ratios but fail for the average cosines. It should be noted that the NLL BFKL calculations performed in [15] agree with the data for all observables. Full NLL BFKL calculation from another group of authors have become available recently [16]. Somewhat worse agreement with the CMS data is demonstrated in latter work.",

Predictions from Monte Carlo models show wide spread and the best description of the data is demonstrated by the cosmic ray MC EPOS. The experimental data on inclusive jet production in a wide range of p T and rapidity is described by the pQCD NLO predictions within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Dijet production ratios and azimuthal decorrelations probe higher order pQCD radiation, with the theory predictions demonstrating a significant spread. The MC predictions show different levels of agreement with the data for different azimuthal decorrelation observables, with the best overall agreement demonstrated by HERWIG++. NLL BFKL calculations provide a good description of the average cosine ratios.",
