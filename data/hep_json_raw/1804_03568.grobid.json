            "text": "Results of a search for gluino pair production with subsequent R-parity-violating decays to quarks are presented. This search uses 36.1 fb-1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of Vs = 13 TeV at the LHC. The analysis is performed using requirements on the number of jets and the number of jets tagged as containing a b-hadron as well as a topological observable formed by the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets in the event. No significant excess above the expected Standard Model background is observed. Limits are set on the production of gluinos in models with the R-parity-violating decays of either the gluino itself (direct decay) or the neutralino produced in the R-parity-conserving gluino decay (cascade decay). In the gluino cascade decay model, gluino masses below 1850 GeV are excluded for 1000 GeV neutralino mass. For the gluino direct decay model, the 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio varies between 0.80 fb at mg = 900 GeV and 0.011 fb at mg = 1800 GeV.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6] is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model (SM) which fundamentally relates fermions and bosons. It is an alluring theoretical possibility given its poten tial to solve the hierarchy problem [7][8][9][10]. This Letter presents a search for supersymmetric gluino pair production with subsequent R-parity-violating (RPV) [11][12][13][14][15][16] decays into quarks in events with many jets using 36.1 fb-1 of p-p collision data at y/s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, the RPV compo nent of a generic superpotential can be written as [15,17]: (1) where i, j, k = 1,2, 3 are generation indices. The generation indices are omitted in the discussions that follow if the statement being made is not specific to any generation. The first three terms in Eq. (1) are often referred to as the trilinear couplings, whereas the last term is referred to as bilinear. The Li and Q i represent the lep ton and quark SU(2)L doublet superfields, whereas H2 represents the Higgs superfield. The Ej, D j, and Uj are the charged lepton, down-type quark, and up-type quark SU(2)L singlet superfields, respectively. The couplings for each term are given by A, A', and A\", while k is a mass parameter. In the benchmark models considered in this search, the couplings of A and A' are set to zero and only the baryon-number-violating coupling A' j is non-zero. Because of the structure of Eq. (1), scenarios in which only Aj = 0 are of ten referred to as UDD scenarios. The diagrams shown in Fig. 1 represent the benchmark processes used in the optimization and design of the search presented in this Letter. In the gluino direct decay model ( Fig. 1(a)), the gluino directly decays into three quarks via the RPV UDD coupling A'', leading to six quarks at tree level in the final state of gluino pair production. In the gluino cascade decay model ( Fig. 1(b)), the gluino decays into two quarks and a neutralino, which, in turn, decays into three quarks via the RPV UDD coupling A'', resulting in ten quarks at tree level in the final state of gluino pair production. Events produced in these processes typically have a high multiplicity of reconstructed jets. In signal models considered in this search, the production of the gluino pair is assumed to be independent of the value of A''. Decay branching ratios of all possible A'' flavour combinations given by the struc ture of Eq. (1) are assumed to be equal, and decays of the gluino and neutralino are implemented as prompt decays via modifying the decay widths of gluinos and neutralinos. In this configuration, a significant portion of signal events contain at least one bottom or top quark. Other models of the RPV UDD scenario, such as the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2018.08.021 0370-2693/\u00a9 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The black lines represent Standard Model particles, the red lines represent SUSY partners, the grey shaded circles represent effective vertices that include off-shell propagators (e.g. heavy squarks coupling to a X0 neutralino and a quark), and the blue solid circles represent effective RPV vertices allowed by the baryon-number-violating A\" couplings with off-shell propagators (e.g. heavy squarks coupling to two quarks). Quark and antiquark are not distinguished in the diagrams. (For interpretation of the colours in the figure(s), the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Minimal Flavour Violation model [18,19], predict that the gluino decays preferentially into final states with third-generation quarks. These theoretical arguments motivate the introduction of b-tagging requirements into the search.",

The search strategy closely follows the one implemented in Ref. [21], which excludes a gluino with mass up to 917 GeV in the gluino direct decay model, and a gluino with mass up to 1000 GeV for a neutralino mass of 500 GeV in the gluino cas cade decay model. Two other publications [22,23] from the ATLAS Collaboration reported on the searches for signals from a differ ent gluino cascade decay model where the quarks/antiquarks from the gluino decay are top quark-anti-quark pairs and the quarks from the neutralino decays are u, d or s quarks. These searches probed events with at least one electron or muon. The most strin gent lower limit on the gluino mass, from Ref. [22], is 2100 GeV for a neutralino mass of 1000 GeV. In a recent publication [24], the CMS Collaboration set a lower limit of 1610 GeV on the gluino mass in an RPV UDD scenario where the gluino exclusively decays into a final state of a top quark, a bottom quark and a strange quark, using ^/s = 13 TeV pp collision data.",

The muon spectrometer surrounds these calorimeters, and comprises a system of precision tracking chambers and fast-response detectors for triggering, with three large toroidal magnets, each consisting of eight coils, provid ing the magnetic field for the muon detectors. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [27]. The first-level trigger is imple mented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by the software-based high-level trigger, reducing the event rate to about 1 kHz.",

            "text": "Signal samples were produced covering a wide range of gluino and neutralino masses. In the gluino direct decay model, the gluino mass (mg) was varied from 900 GeV to 1800 GeV. In the case of the cascade decays, for each gluino mass (1000 GeV to 2100 GeV), separate samples were generated with multiple neutralino masses (m~ 0) ranging from 50 GeV to 1.65 TeV. In each case, m^0 < mg. In the gluino cascade decay model, the two quarks produced from the gluino decay were restricted to be first or second generation quarks. All three generations of quarks were allowed to be in the final state of the lightest supersym metric particle decay. Signal samples were generated at leading order (LO) accuracy with up to two additional partons using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.3.3 event generator [28] interfaced with PYTHIA 8.186 [29] for the parton shower, fragmentation and un derlying event. The A14 set of tuned parameters [30] was used together with the NNPDF2.3LO parton distribution function (PDF) set [31]. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program was used to describe the prop erties of the b-and c-hadron decays in the signal samples. The signal production cross sections were calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, adding the resumma tion of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO + NLL) [32][33][34][35][36]. The nominal cross section and its uncer tainty were taken from Ref. [37]. Cross sections were evaluated assuming masses of 450 TeV for the light-flavour squarks in the case of gluino pair production. In the simulation, the total widths of gluinos and neutralinos were set to be 1 GeV, effectively making their decays prompt.",

The multijet background was stud ied with three different leading order Monte Carlo samples. The PYTHIA 8.186 event generator was used together with the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3LO parton distribution functions, while the Herwig++ 2.7.1 event generator was used together with the UEEE5 tune [38] and CTEQ6L1 PDF sets [39]. The Sherpa event genera tor [40] was also used to generate multijet events for the study of background estimation. Matrix elements were calculated with up to three partons at LO, were showered with Sherpa as well, and were merged using the ME+PS@LO prescription [41]. The CT10 PDF set [42] was used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. For the generation of fully hadronic decays of ff events, the Powheg-Boxv2 event gener ator [43] was used with the CT10 PDF set and was interfaced with PYTHIA 6.428 [44].

The four-momenta of the jets are calculated as the sum of the four-momenta of the clusters, which are assumed to be massless. For the large-R jets, the original constituents are calibrated using the local cell weight ing algorithm [53,56] prior to jet-finding and reclustered using the longitudinally-invariant kt algorithm [57] with a radius parame ter of Rsub-jet = 0.2, to form a collection of sub-jets. A sub-jet is discarded if it carries less than 5% of the large-R jet pT of the orig inal jet. The constituents in the remaining sub-jets are then used to recalculate the large-R jet four-momenta, and the jet energy and mass are further calibrated to particle level using correction factors derived from simulation [58]. The resulting \"trimmed\" [58,59] large-R jets are required to have pT > 200 GeV and |p| < 2.0. The analysis does not place any requirement on the vertex asso ciation of tracks within a jet nor on the timing of the calorimeter cells within a jet, which preserves the sensitivity of this analysis to models containing non-prompt jets. The small-R jets are corrected for pile-up contributions and are then calibrated to the particle level using simulated events followed by a correction based on in situ measurements [53,60,61].",

The jet mass template method is discussed in Ref. [66], and its first experimental im plementation is described in Ref. [21]. In this method, single-jet mass templates are extracted from signal-depleted control regions. These jet mass templates are created in bins that are defined by a number of observables, which include jet pT and |p|, and the b-matching status. They provide a probability density function that describes the relative probability for a jet with a given pT and n to have a certain mass. This method assumes that jet mass templates only depend on these observables and are the same in the control regions and signal regions. A sample where the background MjE distribution needs to be estimated, such as a validation region or a signal region, is referred to as the kinematic sample. The only in formation used is the jet pT and p, as well as its b-matching status, which are inputs to the templates. For each jet in the kinematic sample, its corresponding jet mass template is used to generate a random jet mass. An MjE distribution can be constructed from and (b) the difference in pseudorapidity between the two leading large-R jets |Ap12 | .

In addition, each signal region includes an additional MjE requirement for statistical inter pretation. Control regions are defined separately for non-matched jets and b-matched jets. For the uncertainty determination regions, the Njet and leading-jet pT (pT,1) requirements are used. This jet mass prediction procedure is similar to the one em ployed in Ref.

First, the statistical fluctuations in the jet mass templates are propagated to the back ground yield prediction in the signal region, and therefore consid ered as a systematic uncertainty of the jet mass template method, whereas the Run-1 analysis made assumptions about the form of the template shape by smoothing using a Gaussian kernel tech nique.

Studies us ing Monte Carlo multijet events have shown that scaling up and down the predicted jet mass by the jet mass response in the UDRs leads to variations in the predicted M^ distributions that cover the difference between the observed and predicted MjE distributions. Fig. 4 shows the jet mass responses in the UDRs as a function of jet pT and |n|. An under-prediction of jet mass is seen in the UDR1, varying between a few percent and 14%. In the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV, the UDR2 indicates an over-prediction, at the 4-5% level. Overall, the behaviour of the jet mass response is quite similar between different pseudorapidity regions. It was checked and found that the difference between predicted and observed jet masses in the UDRs are not due to the trigger inefficiency in the UDRs and CR, based on studies performed with Monte Carlo multijet samples and data. In these studies, additional HT require ments are introduced in the analysis so that the UDRs and CR are fully efficient with respect to the HLT_ht1000 trigger, and the differences in the UDRs remain qualitatively the same. The differ ences in the jet mass response are used as an estimate for the pTand |n|-dependent systematic uncertainty of the jet mass predic tion. Since the signs of the differences from the UDR1 and UDR2 are opposite in the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV, the larger of the differences from these UDRs is used as the uncertainty and symmetrized. The uncertainty of the jet mass prediction is uncor related between the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV (\"low-pT\") and the pT range of > 400 GeV (\"high-pT\"). For jets within the low-pT or high-pT range, the jet mass prediction uncertainties are corre lated between different pT and |n| bins.",

The uncertainty of the correction factors is propagated to a systematic uncertainty in the yields in the signal region. This uncertainty is between 1% and 5% for all signal models considered in this analysis. Due to low acceptance, the statistical uncertainty of the signal yield predicted by the Monte Carlo samples can be as large as 8% for signal models with mg < 1000 GeV. The Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty for signal models with large mg is neg ligible. Uncertainties in the signal acceptance due to the choices of QCD scales and PDF, and the modelling of initial-state radia tion (ISR) are studied. The uncertainty due to the PDF and QCD scales is found to be as large as 25% for mg = 1000 GeV, 10% for mg = 1700 GeV, and a few percent for mg = 2100 GeV. The rel atively large uncertainty at mg = 1000 GeV is partly because the signal region Mp requirement is placed at the tail of the Mp dis tribution, which is more sensitive to scale variations. Since signal events and background events have different kine matic distributions and jet flavour compositions, the presence of signal events in data can bias the predicted background yield in the signal region. The presence of signal events can lead to a pos itive contribution to the predicted background yield, which can be  determined by studying signal Monte Carlo samples, and there fore is subtracted from the background prediction for the model dependent interpretation. This potential bias is not considered for the model-independent interpretation. As the contribution is in duced by the signal events, the correction also scales with the cross section of the signal events, which is equivalent to a correc tion of the predicted signal yield. The size of the correction relative to the predicted signal can be as large as 50% for cascade decay models with mxo = 50 GeV, and decreases to a few percent for",

In the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV, the UDR2 indicates an over-prediction, at the 4-5% level. Overall, the behaviour of the jet mass response is quite similar between different pseudorapidity regions. It was checked and found that the difference between predicted and observed jet masses in the UDRs are not due to the trigger inefficiency in the UDRs and CR, based on studies performed with Monte Carlo multijet samples and data. In these studies, additional HT require ments are introduced in the analysis so that the UDRs and CR are fully efficient with respect to the HLT_ht1000 trigger, and the differences in the UDRs remain qualitatively the same. The differ ences in the jet mass response are used as an estimate for the pTand |n|-dependent systematic uncertainty of the jet mass predic tion. Since the signs of the differences from the UDR1 and UDR2 are opposite in the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV, the larger of the differences from these UDRs is used as the uncertainty and symmetrized. The uncertainty of the jet mass prediction is uncor related between the pT range of 200 GeV-400 GeV (\"low-pT\") and the pT range of > 400 GeV (\"high-pT\"). For jets within the low-pT or high-pT range, the jet mass prediction uncertainties are corre lated between different pT and |n| bins.Possible bias on the background estimate due to the presence of tt events, where the jet origin is different from that in multi jet events, is not explicitly addressed by the background estima tion strategy. However, a study using Monte Carlo multijet and ttt samples finds that the background prediction is insensitive to the presence of ttt events, because of its relatively small cross section.The jet mass template method is then applied to data in the validation and signal regions. Uncertainties in the jet mass predic tion derived from the UDRs are propagated to the predicted MjE distribution. The background estimation performance is first exam ined in the validation regions.Fig. 5shows the observed and pre dicted MjE distributions in the validation regions, where in general they are seen to agree well.
