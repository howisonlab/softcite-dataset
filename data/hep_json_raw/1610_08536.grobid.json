We report about an R&D project exploring the feasibility of direct measurements of nuclear gluon densities at x >\u223c 0.1 (gluonic EMC effect, antishadowing) using open charm production at EIC. We describe the charm production rates and angle-momentum distributions at large x and discuss methods of charm reconstruction using next-generation detector capabilities (\u03c0/K identification, vertex reconstruction). The results could be used also for other physics applications of heavy quark production at EIC (fragmentation functions, jets, heavy quark propagation in nuclei).",

            "text": "An Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is being developed as a next-generation facility for nuclear physics and has been recommended for future construction in the 2015 U.S. Department of Energy's Long-Range Plan [1]. The present EIC designs envisage electron-proton (ep) centerof-mass (CM) energies \u221a s ep \u223c 20-100 GeV, with possible extensions to higher energies, and aim to deliver luminosities \u223c 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 over the full energy range [2,3]. Acceleration of a wide variety of nuclear beams would be possible, ranging from the deuteron (A = 2) to heavy ions (A \u223c 200). In electron-nucleus (eA) scattering at the collider the CM energy per nucleon is lower compared to ep by a factor Z/A \u2248 0.7 (0.6) for light (heavy) nuclei, and the luminosity per nucleon is approximately the same as in ep. Such a facility would significantly expand the \"energy-luminosity frontier\" in electromagnetic scattering (see figure 1), particularly for nuclei, and enable qualitative advances in exploring short-range structure and Quantum Chromodynamics. The EIC physics program includes studies of the nucleon's three-dimensional partonic structure (gluon spin, quark spin flavor decomposition, transverse momentum, spatial structure, correlations), the dynamics of color fields in nuclei (quarks/gluon densities in nuclei, nuclear shadowing, physics of high gluon densities), and the conversion of color charge to hadrons (color transparency, parton propagation in medium, hadronization) [4,5]. The EIC would vastly expand the capabilities for studying heavy quark production in electromagnetic scattering as compared to present facilities. Measurements of open charm and beauty electro-and photoproduction were performed at the HERA ep collider at x B < 0.01, using various methods of charm/beauty identification; see [6,7] and references therein.   Figure 1. CM energies and luminosities of experimental facilities for electromagnetic scattering at multi-GeV energies (ep/eA/\u00b5p/\u00b5A; past, present, and future). The coverage of the EIC designs is indicated by the blue box (ep, Z/A = 1).",

The EIC luminosity is two orders-of-magnitude higher than that of HERA and would permit measurements of open charm/beauty production with much higher rates, extending the kinematic coverage to the region of large x B (\u223c 0.1) and rare processes such as high-p T jets. Heavy quark production with electromagnetic probes could for the first time be measured on nuclear targets and used to study the gluonic structure of nuclei and the propagation of heavy quarks through cold nuclear matter with full control of the initial state. Next-generation detection capabilities at the EIC -tracking, vertex detection, and especially \u03c0/K identification -would open up new channels for charm/beauty reconstruction compared to HERA and further boost the rate of identified heavy quarks for physics purposes. The study of possible EIC applications to heavy quark production therefore deserves special attention. Here we consider heavy quark production as a new method for measuring the gluon densities in nuclei.",

The nuclear modifications of gluons are largely unknown at present, and basic questions remain to be answered (see figure 2b): Is the nuclear gluon density suppressed at x > 0.3 like the valence quarks (gluonic EMC effect)? Is the nuclear gluon density enhanced at x \u223c 0.1 (gluon antishadowing)? The answers to these questions would offer insight into the change of the nucleon's gluonic structure due to nuclear binding and the QCD structure of nucleon-nucleon interactions.

The charm rates drop rapidly above x B \u223c 0.1 due to the decrease of the gluon density. The fraction of DIS events with charm production changes from \u223c 10% at x B \u223c 0.01 to \u223c 1% at x B \u223c 0.1 (exact numbers depending on Q 2 ). The charm fraction increases with Q 2 at fixed x B as expected for a gluon-dominated process. With an integrated luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 charm production numbers of \u223c 10 6 (\u223c 10 5 ) can be achieved in DIS at x B \u223c 0.01 (\u223c 0.1). Higher charm rates could be achieved by lowering the Q 2 cutoff and/or including charm photoproduction. These numbers define the starting point for charm physics analysis. The challenge in gluon measurements at x B \u223c 0.1 will be to identify charm events with an efficiency of \u223c few %, in the presence of a DIS background that is \u223c 100 times larger.  The nucleon momenta in the medium-energy EIC proton/ion beams are \u223c few 10 GeV; e.g., collisions of 10 GeV electrons on 50 GeV nucleons at s eN = 2000 GeV 2 . With this setup the charm quarks produced in DIS at x B \u223c 0.1 typically emerge with large angles in the lab frame (which approximately coincides with the virtual photon-gluon CM frame) and carry moderate momenta \u223c< 10 GeV. (The actual charm angle and momentum distributions exhibit a complex dependence on x B and Q 2 and have to be determined by kinematic transformations.) The charm quark distributions are imparted on the produced charmed hadrons and their final decay hadrons (\u03c0, K, p). A major advantage of the medium-energy EIC design is that these hadrons emerge at large angles and moderate momenta, where good particle identification (PID), tracking, and vertex detection capabilities can be provided by the central detector. In contrast, with a highenergy collider (HERA) the hadrons from large-x B charm decays would appear at forward angles and with much larger momenta, rendering their detection more difficult.",

Their feasibility for gluon measurements at x B \u223c 0.1, where the fraction of charm events is only \u223c 1% of DIS, needs to be explored further.

The charm rates appear sufficient to constrain nuclear gluons at x > 0.1, if charm reconstruction could be performed with an overall efficiency of \u223c few %. Practical methods to achieve such efficiency are being investigated. Heavy quark production at EIC could of course also be used for other physics purposes (e.g. heavy quark fragmentation functions, jets, propagation and hadronization in nuclei), which may impose less stringent requirements. Simulating such measurements would elucidate other aspects of charm production/reconstruction with EIC and provide further impulses for detector development.",
