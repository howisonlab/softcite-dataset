The uncertainties in the vertex reconstruction are the dominant sources of error. These include uncertainties in the IP profile, charged track selection based on track helix errors, helix parameter corrections, \u2206t and vertex goodness-of-fit selection, and SVD misalignment. Toy MC samples showed some small fitting bias for CP parameters due to low statistics in each sample. We take this bias as a systematic. The parameters for w and \u2206w, resolution function, physics parameters, background shape and signal fraction were varied by \u00b11\u03c3. We estimate that the CP eigenstate component of the background does not exceed 10% of the total. The effect of CP asymmetry in the background was estimated by changing the background PDF to be composed of 10% CP eigenstates with CP parameters at the physical limits. We also investigate the effect of mis-reconstructed signal events using signal MC. This is achieved by comparing the fit result of the signal MC sample with another fit on the same sample, which required that the events were reconstructed correctly. Tag-side interference comes from CP violation on the tag-side [17], and is estimated with B \u2192 D * l\u03bd. We generate MC pseudo-experiments and perform an ensemble test to obtain systematic biases [18]. The systematics are summarized in Table II. In the 3-parameter fit, the time-dependent \u2206t distribution assuming no direct CP violation, is given by  The systematics are determined in much the same way as in the 2-parameter fit. However, since BaBar claims evidence for a B 0 \u2192 D + s1 (2536)D * \u2212 contribution to the D * + D * \u2212 K 0 S final state [19], and resonant structure is more important in the 3-parameter fit, we excluded the D + s1 (2536) region, m (D * \u00b1 K 0 S ) < 2.6 GeV/c 2 , and took the difference in the results as a systematic. The systematics are summarized in Table III  In summary, we measure the branching fraction (Eq. 6) and CP parameters of B 0 \u2192 D * + D * \u2212 K 0 S with a 2-parameter fit (Eq. 15), and 3-parameter fit (Eq. 17) with 414 fb \u22121 at the Belle detector. An upper limit on the branching fraction of the intermediate two-body decay B 0 \u2192 D + s1 (2536)D * \u2212 (Eq. 8) is also obtained. In the 2-parameter fit, there is no evidence for direct CP violation and a large dilution of sin 2\u03c6 1 is implied. In the 3-parameter fit, J c /J 0 appears to be non-zero; a large value of this parameter could indicate the presence of a broad unknown D * * + s state. As in the 2-parameter fit, a large dilution of the CP asymmetry from polarization and resonant structure is implied since 2J s1 /J 0 sin 2\u03c6 1 is consistent with zero. According to [5], 2J s2 /J 0 , is expected to be positive if this unknown wide resonance exists.",
