In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) discovered a scalar boson with mass of approximately 125 GeV/c 2 and prop-erties consistent with those expected for the SM Higgs boson [2,3]. Some evidence for such a boson had also been presented by the Tevatron experiments [4]. The detailed phenomenology of the Higgs boson is, however, yet to be investigated. The possibility that the recently observed Higgs boson is part of an extended Higgs sector is attractive because it would address some relevant open questions about the SM such as the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe [5] and it is not ruled out experimentally.",

            "text": "In this Letter, we consider an alternative case in which the newly-discovered boson corresponds to the high-mass H 0 and the lower-mass h 0 is yet to be observed. This scenario is poorly constrained experimentally if tan \u03b2 is large and h 0 has suppressed couplings to fermions at leading order. The h 0 is referred to as the fermiophobic Higgs boson (h f ). Searches performed at various experiments [9][10][11] have set lower bounds of its mass, m h f , at 100-150 GeV/c 2 . These mass limits, however, were obtained assuming simplified models in which the couplings between the h f and electroweak-gauge bosons are of the same strength as those in the SM, which is not necessarily true in the 2HDM, as they may be strongly suppressed when tan \u03b2 is large [12], by a factor of approximately 10 \u22122 when tan \u03b2 = 10, for example. A low-mass h f (m h f 100 GeV/c 2 ), therefore, could have eluded the previous searches if tan \u03b2 is large. To fill this gap in exploring the Higgs sector, we focus on the process qq \u2192 W * \u2192 h f H \u00b1 , followed by the decay H \u00b1 \u2192 h f W * , where q andq are quarks and antiquarks in the colliding protons and antiprotons taking part in the hard interaction, and W * represents a virtual W boson. This process, involving H \u00b1 , has enhanced production rates for large tan \u03b2 [13]. By assuming no couplings to fermions, the branching fraction (B) of h f decays to two photons, h f \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 , is near 100% for m h f 95 GeV/c 2 [13,14]. The production of two h f particles could result in a distinctive multiphoton topology with small background rates. The couplings of the H 0 to SM particles in this scenario are similar to those of the SM Higgs boson [13] and we perform the analysis assuming that its mass, m H 0 , is 125 GeV/c 2 . The decay of H 0 \u2192h f h f , when it is kinematically allowed and when the coupling is sizable, can also lead to multiphoton final states. We conservatively neglect this contribution to the expected signal. We also assume the A 0 mass, m A 0 , to be 350 GeV/c 2 , large enough so as not to contribute to H \u00b1 decays -the specific choice of m A 0 has little effect on the final result, and we take tan \u03b2 = 10. The expected production cross section multiplied by the appropriate branching fractions ranges approximately from 100 pb to 10 fb for the explored m h f and the H \u00b1 mass (m H \u00b1 ) values, from 10 to 105 GeV/c 2 and from 30 to 300 GeV/c 2 , respectively. This analysis is based on the entire data set of proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) between February 2002 and September 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.2 fb \u22121 . We select events with multiple photon candidates by applying criteria optimized for achieving the best sensitivity. We compare the observed event yields with background expectations, which are evaluated using a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and experimental data. A challenge is to estimate the contribution from background events containing clusters of particles (jets) misidentified as photons.",

In the analysis, we select events with at least three EM-energy clusters with E T > 15 GeV. They must be located in the central detector (pseudorapidity magnitude |\u03b7| < 1.1) [16], where reliable tracking of charged particles is available [17].

            "text": "Another source of background is the production of events with jets misidentified as photons. This background includes photons produced in the fragmentation process of quarks or gluons to hadrons. For estimating this contribution, we introduce a loose photon selection which simply collects EM-energy clusters without any associated tracks. In a sample of three-photon candidates selected with the loose selection, there are eight possible combinations of E T -ordered photons and EMlike jets, \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3\u03b3j, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , where j represents an EM-like jet. The numbers of these events are unknown and we express them by a vector n * of event counts (n * \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 , n * \u03b3\u03b3j , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ). By applying the full set of criteria for the photon selection, we categorize the events in eight classes depending on whether each of the photon candidates in a given event passes (p) or fails (f ) the full photon selection (n ppp , n ppf , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ), denoted by n. The components of n * are obtained by solving eight linear equations n = En * , where E is an 8\u00d78 matrix, the elements of which are calculated from the probability for a genuine photon or jet that meets the loose selection to also meet the full photon selection. Once n * is obtained by inverting the matrix E, we estimate the misidentified-jet contribution to n ppp using E and the calculated elements of n * except n * \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 . Statistical uncertainties are propagated to n * . The photon efficiencies are measured with the pythia MC and detector simulation, with a final calibration derived by comparing unbiased electrons in Z\u2192e + e \u2212 events in the data and the MC simulation. We estimate the probability for misidentifying jets as photons as a function of E T using isolated jets in data samples collected with inclusive jet triggers. We correct for contributions of genuine photons to the set of objects passing the photon selection in the jet samples based on the differences in the expected distributions of isolation and shower shape variables [18]. Genuine photons tend to be isolated and to have good \u03c7 2 values for the comparison of the observed and expected shower shapes, while misidentified jets show broad distributions in both quantities. These differences enable us to extrapolate the amount of misidentified jets from regions of larger isolation and \u03c7 2 values to the region selected by the photon identification. The fraction of misidentified jets is then estimated to be approximately 30% using the calorimetry-based isolation. The misidentification probability varies from a few percent to 25% depending on the E T .",

We assume a uniform prior probability density for the signal rate. The theoretical cross sections at leading order are computed using pythia with an enhancement factor of 1.4 to approximate higher-order contributions. This factor is taken to be the ratio of the W boson production cross section measured by CDF [17] to the corresponding prediction by pythia. This is similar to a calculation of the ratio of the next-to-leading-order prediction to the leading-order prediction of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 for Higgs boson pair production in Drell-Yan-like processes at the LHC [23], and we note that the central values, which are expected to be similar, are within the theoretical uncertainty on the Higgs boson pair production prediction, which is much larger than the experimental uncertainty on the W boson enhancement factor. Because the h f signal production process under study begins with W boson production, we use the measured W boson production enhancement factor, but we use the uncertainty on the theoretical prediction, \u00b10.3, as an estimate of the uncertainty in extrapolating the enhancement factor from one process to the other.

Other sources of systematic uncertainties include those on the parton momentum distributions in the colliding hadrons, the initial-and finalstate radiation of a gluon, and the renormalization scale, TABLE I. Expected number of background events compared to the observed number of events after the final event selection. The first contribution to the uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. which are each found to contribute less than 3% of the total efficiency [18]. We compare the MadGraph cross section with mcfm [25] calculations that take into account different higher-order contributions and take the resulting difference of 0.83 events as a systematic uncertainty on the yield of direct triphoton events. The systematic uncertainty from the renormalization scale, that from the initial-and final-state radiation, and that from the luminosity measurement [26] range from 0.16 to 0.21 events. We estimate the total systematic uncertainty on the expected yield of events with misidentified jets to be 0.17 events, which includes the contribution from the measurement of the misidentified-jet probability and that from the possible difference of the probabilities between jets originating from quarks and gluons. The dominant uncertainty on the electroweak contribution originates from the limited size of the simulated event samples used to estimate the small probability to find an extra photonlike particle in the W (\u2192e\u03bd)\u03b3 events.

The region of parameters given by m h f between 10 and 100 GeV/c 2 and m H \u00b1 between 30 and 170 GeV/c 2 is excluded. The result does not change significantly if we repeat the analysis by assuming tan \u03b2 = 30, while the excluded region shrinks by approximately 20 GeV/c 2 for both of m h f and m H \u00b1 for tan \u03b2 = 3.",

The observed number of signal candidate events in data is consistent with the expected number of background events. We calculate the upper limit on the product of the cross section and the branching fraction at 95% Bayesian credibility for m h f values ranging from 10 to 105 GeV/c 2 and for m H \u00b1 val-ues ranging from 30 to 300 GeV/c 2 , and then translate these limits into an excluded region in the m h f vs. m H \u00b1 plane, shown in Fig. 3. The region of parameters given by m h f between 10 and 100 GeV/c 2 and m H \u00b1 between 30 and 170 GeV/c 2 is excluded for tan \u03b2 = 10. This is the first search for a fermiophobic neutral Higgs boson with mass smaller than the boson discovered at the LHC in the two-Higgs-doublet model.",
