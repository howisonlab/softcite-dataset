            "text": "A search is presented for pair production of the standard model Higgs boson using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The final state consists of two b quark-antiquark pairs. The search is conducted in the region of phase space where one pair is highly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet, and the other pair is resolved and is reconstructed using two b-tagged jets. The results are obtained by combining this analysis with another from CMS looking for events with two large jets. Limits are set on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions for narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extradimensional models having a mass in the range 750-3000 GeV. The resulting observed and expected upper limits on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross section correspond to 179 and 114 times the standard model value, respectively, at 95% confidence level. The existence of anomalous Higgs boson couplings is also investigated and limits are set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross sections for representative coupling values.",

            "text": "In the standard model (SM), Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3] pair-production can occur through several subprocesses and is sensitive to the Higgs boson self-coupling. In proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC, the SM HH production cross section is mainly due to the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess, which proceeds via an internal fermion loop dominated by the top quark, t. At a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, this cross section is 33.5 +2. 5 \u22122.8 fb [4][5][6], which is too small to be observable using the current data. However, many beyond the standard model (BSM) theories predict higher rates of Higgs boson pair production. The rate could be increased through the production of a massive BSM resonance X, which subsequently decays to a Higgs boson pair (X \u2192 HH) [7], a process that could be observable at the LHC. If the resonance mass m X is too large for X to be directly produced in pp interactions, the particle could manifest itself through off-shell effects, leading to anomalous couplings of the H boson to the SM particles, including the HH self-interaction [8]. Thus, BSM effects may modify the HH differential and integral production cross sections, making this process observable with current data.",

Here, m H = 125 GeV is the Higgs boson mass [17,18] and v = 246 GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.

A search targeting the high m X range for a KK bulk graviton or a radion decaying to HH, in the bbbb final state, was published by the CMS Collaboration [39], in which two large-area jets are used to reconstruct the highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons (\"fully-merged\" event topology). A similar search, focusing on a lower range of m X , was also performed by CMS [40], using events with four separate b quark jets.

To mitigate the effect of pileup on the AK4 jet momentum, tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded in the clustering, and an offset correction [47,48] is applied for remaining contributions from neutral particles. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of the jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in events containing either a pair of jets, or a Z boson or a photon recoiling against a jet, or several jets, are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale in data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components.

The final state kinematic distributions of the HH pairs depend upon the values of these five parameters. A statistical approach was developed to identify twelve regions of the parameter space, referred to as clusters, with distinct kinematic observables of the HH system. In particular, models in the same cluster have similar distributions of the di-Higgs boson invariant mass m HH , the transverse momentum of the di-Higgs boson system, and the modulus of the cosine of the polar angle of one Higgs boson with respect to the beam axis, while the distributions of these variables are unique when comparing models from different clusters [66]. For each cluster, a set of representative values of the five parameters is chosen, referred to as the \"shape benchmarks\". Events are simulated for each of these shape benchmarks, as well as for the SM values of these couplings, and the case where the Higgs boson self-coupling vanishes, i.e. \u03ba \u03bb = 0.

The double-b tagger exploits the presence of two hadronized JHEP01(2019)040 b quarks inside the boosted H \u2192 bb decay, and uses variables related to b hadron lifetime and mass to distinguish H jets against a background of jets of other flavours.

An H jet candidate should have a double-b tagger discriminator greater than 0.8, which corresponds to an efficiency of 30% and a misidentification rate of about 1%, as measured in a sample of multijet events. The efficiency of the double-b tagger for simulated jets is corrected to match that in the data, based on efficiency measurements using jets containing pairs of muons, thereby yielding samples enriched in jets from gluons splitting to bb pairs.

A set of signal-free control regions is defined by changing the criteria on the soft-drop mass and the double-b tagger discriminator of the selected AK8 jet from those used for the H tagging. The selection criteria applied to the AK4 jets forming the resolved H \u2192 bb are the same as those used for the signal regions. If the soft-drop mass is within 60 GeV above or below the H jet mass window of 105-135 GeV, these regions are referred to as the mass sideband regions. These sidebands are separated into regions that pass or fail the double-b tagger tagging requirement. We define the pass-fail ratio R p/f as the ratio of events for which the AK8 jet passes and fails the double-b tagger tagging requirement. The R p/f is measured in the soft-drop mass sidebands as a function of soft-drop mass. These values are fit to a quadratic function of the H jet mass to calculate the R p/f in the signal region. The antitag region, defined with the same criteria as the signal region, but with the AK8 jet failing the double-b tagger requirement, is then scaled by the R p/f value to estimate the multijets background in the signal region. This is done in bins of soft-drop mass to predict the entire background shape. The dependence of R p/f on m Jjj,red was found to be negligible, within the measurement uncertainties.

The search is conducted in the region of phase space where at least one of the Higgs bosons has a large Lorentz boost, so that the H \u2192 bb decay products are collimated to form a single jet, an H jet. The search combines events with one H jet plus two b jets with events having two H jets, thus adding sensitivity to the previous analysis [39]. The results of the search are compared with predictions for the resonant production of a narrow Kaluza-Klein bulk graviton and a narrow radion in warped extradimensional models. The search is also sensitive to several beyond standard model non-resonant HH production scenarios. Such cases may arise either when an off-shell massive resonance produced in proton-proton collisions decays to HH, or through beyond standard model effects in the Higgs boson coupling parameters.

Upper: the double-b tagger pass-fail ratio R p/f of the leading-p T AK8 jet in semiresolved events as a function of the difference between the soft-drop mass and the Higgs boson mass, m J \u2212 m H . The measured ratio in different bins of m J \u2212 m H is used in the fit (red solid line), except in the region around m J \u2212 m H = 0, which corresponds to the signal region (blue markers). The fitted function is interpolated to obtain R p/f in the signal region. Lower: the reduced mass distribution m Jjj,red in the data (black markers) with the estimated background represented as the black histogram. The tt+jets contribution from simulation is represented in green. The rest of the background is multijets, calculated by applying the R p/f to the antitag region. The uncertainty in the total background, before fitting the background model to the data, is depicted using the shaded region. The signal distributions for a bulk graviton with a mass of 800 GeV (blue) and the non-resonant benchmark 2 model (red) are also shown for assumed values of the products of the production cross sections for HH and the branching fraction to 4b, \u03c3B. For the left and right figures, the pseudorapidity intervals are 0 \u2264 |\u2206\u03b7| < 1 and 1 \u2264 |\u2206\u03b7| \u2264 2, respectively.",
