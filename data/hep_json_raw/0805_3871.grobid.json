To understand these results and the interaction of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium, experimental determination of production ratio of charm over bottom is one of the most important topics, since the behavior of bottom may differ from charm in the medium. We measured the ratio of charm over bottom and total cross section of bottom via partial reconstruction of D 0 \u2192e + K \u2212 \u03bde decay in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV. Total cross sections of charm and bottom were also measured via di-electron continuum in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV.",

            "text": "Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are good probes to study the hot and dense matter created Au+Au collisions at RHIC, since heavy quarks can only be produced in initial collisions. PHENIX experiment has measured heavy quarks via measurement of non-photonic electrons with 0.3 < p T < 9.0 GeV/c at mid-rapidity (| \u03b7 |< 0.35). A large suppression pattern and azimuthal anisotropy of non-photonic electrons have been observed in Au+Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV [1,2]. To understand these results and the interaction of heavy quarks in the medium, a ratio of the number of electrons from charm over that from bottom is one of the most important parameters. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log (FONLL) perturbative QCD calculation predicts electrons from bottom will dominate these from charm above 4 GeV/c [3]. However, there is a large uncertainty about cross section of heavy flavor at even FONLL. Thus, experimental determination of this ratio is a key issue.",

Figure 4(a) shows measured e \u2212 e + pair yield per p+p collision in PHENIX acceptance with a cocktail of known sources. The cocktail accounts for nearly the continuum in the mass region below \u223c 1 GeV/c 2 . Except for the vector meson peaks, the e \u2212 e + pair in the mass range above 1.1 GeV/c 2 is dominated by heavy quarks correlated through flavor conservation. Figure 4(b) shows the e \u2212 e + pair yield remaining after subtraction of the cocktail. The remaining components are cc, bb and Drell-Yan process. To extract signals from cc, the e \u2212 e + pair yield in the range from 1.1 to 2.5 GeV/c 2 was integrated. Integrated yield was extrapolated to zero e \u2212 e + pair mass by using PYTHIA simulation and converted cross section of charm. Contributions from bb and Drell-Yan process were estimated and subtracted. Total cross section of charm was obtained as \u03c3 cc = 544 \u00b1 39(stat) \u00b1 142(sys) \u00b1 200(model)\u00b5b, by using rapidity distribution from NLO pQCD calculation [9].
