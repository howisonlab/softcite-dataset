            "text": "PHENIX measurements are presented for the cross section and double-helicity asymmetry (ALL) in inclusive \u03c0 0 production at midrapidity from p+p collisions at \u221a s = 510 GeV from data taken in 2012 and 2013 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The next-to-leading-order perturbativequantum-chromodynamics theory calculation is in excellent agreement with the presented cross section results. The calculation utilized parton-to-pion fragmentation functions from the recent DSS14 global analysis, which prefer a smaller gluon-to-pion fragmentation function. The \u03c0 0 ALL results follow an increasingly positive asymmetry trend with pT and \u221a s with respect to the predictions and are in excellent agreement with the latest global analysis results. This analysis incorporated earlier results on \u03c0 0 and jet ALL, and suggested a positive contribution of gluon polarization to the spin of the proton \u2206G for the gluon momentum fraction range x > 0.05. The data presented here extend to a currently unexplored region, down to x \u223c 0.01, and thus provide additional constraints on the value of \u2206G. In the late 1980s, the EMC experiment [1] showed that the spins of quarks and anti-quarks might contribute only a fraction of the proton spin (about 1/3 from the recent global analyses of world spin polarized scattering data [2][3][4][5][6]). This sparked several decades of world-wide effort to understand the proton spin structure in terms of quark and gluon polarizations and their orbital angular momentum, as evidenced by experimental programs at CERN, SLAC, DESY, JLAB, and BNL.",

            "text": "A key component of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Spin program is the determination of the gluon spin contribution to the spin of the proton. High energy polarized proton collisions provide direct access to the gluon polarization \u2206G within the proton through several gluon dominated hard scattering processes, such as high p T jet and hadron production [7]. RHIC results on the double helicity asymmetry A LL in inclusive \u03c0 0 production at \u221a s = 62.4 and 200 GeV from PHENIX [8][9][10][11] and jet production at \u221a s = 200 GeV from STAR [12,13] have made a significant contribution to the \u2206G determination [2,3]. Inclusion of the recent RHIC results from \u221a s = 200 GeV data collected in 2009 [14,15] in the global next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics (pQCD) analysis provided evidence for positive gluon polarization within the proton, with the integral of \u2206G(x, Q 2 = 10 GeV 2 ) in the gluon momentum fraction x > 0.05 being 0.20 +0.06 \u22120.07 at 90% C.L. [16]. The RHIC high luminosity data at \u221a s = 510 GeV allow probing \u2206G in the overlapping x range at higher momentum transfer, and extends our understanding of \u2206G to the unexplored lower x region.",

In this analysis, \u03c0 0 s were reconstructed via \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays using a highly-segmented electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 0.35. The EMCal comprises two calorimeter types, a lead-scintillator (PbSc) sampling calorimeter and a lead-glass (PbGl) Cerenkov calorimeter, with granularity \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.011 \u00d7 0.011 and 0.008 \u00d7 0.008, respectively. Eight EMCal sectors (six PbSc and two PbGl) are located in two nearly back-to-back arms each covering \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 90 \u2022 in azimuth. The PHENIX EMCal also generates a high p T photon (HPP) trigger when the deposited energy in any set of 4 \u00d7 4 towers exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Thin multiwire proportional chambers located in front of the EMCal were used as a veto to suppress the charged hadron background in \u03c0 0 reconstruction [14]. Beam-beam counters (BBC), positioned at \u00b1144 cm from the nominal interaction point along the beam line and covering \u03b7 = \u00b1 3.0-3.9, defined the minimum-bias (MB) collision trigger and determined the location of the collision vertex. Only events with collision vertices within \u00b110 cm (\u00b130 cm) of the nominal interaction point were used in the cross section (asymmetry) analysis. The BBCs were also used to calculate the integrated luminosity of the collected data sample and relative luminosity between colliding bunches with different spin configurations. Zero-degree calorimeters (ZDC), located at \u00b118 m and covering |\u03b7| > 6, were used as another relative luminosity monitor. Equipped with a shower-maximum detector, the ZDC also provided monitoring of the transverse polarization component of colliding bunches in the PHENIX interaction region, utilizing the azimuthal asymmetry in forward neutron production in transversely polarized p+p collisions [18].",

This greatly suppressed the possibility of false asymmetries between colliding bunches with different helicity configuration, due to variation in detector performance. To remove possible systematic effects associated with particular bunch(es) in the process of filling, ramping up and storing the beams in RHIC rings, eight bunch spin patterns were used alternating every RHIC store, typically lasting eight hours. Beam polarizations were measured by RHIC polarimeters [24] three-to-four times during the store.

The point-to-point uncertainties were found to be smaller than 10% of the statistical uncertainty in all p T bins.

Figure 3 shows the \u03c0 0 A LL asymmetries at \u221a s = 510 GeV compared with the DSSV14 calculation [16] based on a global fit of the world helicity asymmetry data. Comparing the data to the DSSV14 curve we obtain \u03c7 2 /NDF=8.0/14, while comparing to the A LL = 0 hypothesis we obtain \u03c7 2 /NDF = 18.2/14; the data prefer the DSSV14 curve by a little more than 3 standard deviations. Figure 4 shows \u03c0 0 A LL data from PHENIX at both \u221a s = 200 GeV [14] and 510 GeV, along with NLO pQCD analyses from three groups [5,6,16]. All three analyses predict an increase in \u03c0 0 A LL at the same x T due to pQCD evolution, with x T = 2p T / \u221a s. Our data is consistent with such an increase. In summary, we have presented the unpolarized cross section and double helicity asymmetry for \u03c0 0 production at midrapidity for p+p collisions at \u221a s = 510 GeV. The NLO pQCD calculation is in excellent agreement with the presented cross section results. The calculation utilized the recent DSS14 set of fragmentation functions, which prefer the reduced fraction of pions produced from gluon hadronization. The \u03c0 0 A LL results follow a positive asymmetry trend with p T and \u221a s predicted by NLO pQCD and are in excellent agreement with the latest global fit results, which suggested a nonzero gluon polarization in the proton for the gluon momentum fraction range x > 0.05. These global fit results included RHIC \u03c0 0 A LL data at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV and jet A LL data at \u221a s = 200 GeV. The presented data at \u221a s = 510 GeV extend the x range probed down to x \u223c 0.01 and provide an additional constraint on \u2206G in this x range [25], which is a crucial step in the nearly two decades of world-wide efforts to understand the contribution of gluon polarization to the spin of the proton. We note the recent \u03c0 0 A LL results at \u221a s = 200 GeV and forward pseudorapidity 0.8 < \u03b7 < 2 from STAR covering the gluon x range down to x \u223c 0.01 (although with large uncertainties) [26]. Data collected by PHENIX with forward EMCal at pseudorapidity 3.1 < \u03b7 < 3.9 and \u221a s = 510 GeV will further extend the x range probed down to x \u223c 0.001.  ",
