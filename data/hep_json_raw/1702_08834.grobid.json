With only four parameters, this matrix is able to describe a large range of phenomena in the quark sector, such as CP violation and rare decays. It can thus be constrained by many different processes, which have to be measured experimentally with high accuracy and computed with good theoretical control. Recently, with the advent of the B factories and the LHCb experiment taking data, the precision has significantly improved. We review the most relevant experimental constraints and theoretical inputs and present fits to the CKM matrix for the Standard Model and for some topical model-independent studies of New Physics.",

The SM has been extensively tested, culminating with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the development of this description, quark flavour physics has played a central role in two different aspects. First, the SM embeds the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix [3,4] arising in charged weak interactions represents the single source of all observed differences between particles and antiparticles, namely CP violation in the quark sector. Second, flavour-changing currents (in particular, neutral ones) have repeatedly revealed evidence for new, heavier degrees of freedom (charm quark, weak gauge bosons, top quark) before their discovery.",

Why are the electroweak and strong interactions treated separately? Why is antimatter absent from the observed universe, even though the amount of CP violation in the SM is too small to produce the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry [5][6][7][8]? New Physics (NP) extensions of the SM are expected to address these issues by including heavier particles related to higher-energy phenomena. The related shorter-distance interactions would have immediate consequences not only in production experiments at high energies but also through deviations from the SM predictions in flavour processes (new sources of CP violation, interferences between SM and NP contributions).",

But it is also required from a more theoretical point of view: The mixing due to the CKM matrix in weak processes has a very simple and constrained structure in the SM and is generally affected significantly by NP extensions, constituting a very powerful probe of models beyond the SM. The need for an accurate determination of the CKM matrix has led to an impressive effort from the experimental community, specifically the extensive research performed at the BaBar and Belle experiments, the large data samples available at the LHC, and the advent of the high-luminosity Belle-II B factory. The theoretical community has also made remarkable progress in the understanding of strong and weak interactions of the quarks, both analytically (in particular, through the development of effective theories) and numerically (with improvements in lattice simulations of QCD). Thus, very high precision measurements of CKM parameters are both needed and currently accessible, and they are the object of this review. We discuss the theoretical grounds related to the CKM matrix in Section 2, review the main experimental constraints on its parameters in Section 3, and present examples of global analyses of the CKM matrix and the impact of NP contributions in Section 4.",

By contrast, there are no flavour-changing transitions in the neutral sector at tree level (Z 0 and photon interactions). The CKM matrix stems from the Yukawa interaction between the Higgs boson and the fermions, and it originates from the misalignment in flavour space of the up and down components of the SU (2) L quark doublets of the SM (as there is no dynamical mechanism in the SM to enforce V uL = V dL ). The V CKM,ij CKM matrix elements (hereafter, V ij ) represent the couplings between up-type quarks U i = (u, c, t) and down-type quarks D j = (d, s, b). There is some arbitrariness in the conventions used to define this matrix. In particular, the relative phases among the left-handed quark fields can be redefined, reducing the number of real parameters describing this unitary matrix from three moduli and six phases to three moduli and one phase [more generally, for N generations, one has N (N \u2212 1)/2 moduli and (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2)/2 phases]. Because CP conjugate processes correspond to interaction terms in the Lagrangian related by Hermitian conjugation, the presence of a phase, and thus the complex nature of the CKM matrix, may induce differences between rates of CP conjugate processes, leading to CP violation. This does not occur for only two generations, where V CKM is real and parametrised by a single real parameter, the Cabibbo angle.",

Constraints coming from K mesons or unflavoured particles have been obtained mostly from dedicated experiments, among which NA48 [11], KLOE [12,13], and KTeV feature prominently. Measurements of CKM parameters from D and B mesons were pioneered by ARGUS [14] at DESY, CLEO, and CLEO-c [15] at Cornell, followed by the so-called B factory experiments BaBar [16] at SLAC and Belle [17] at KEK. They operated primarily at a center-ofmass energy corresponding to the mass of the \u03a5 (4S) resonance. Significant contributions also came from the CDF and D0 experiments at FNAL [18], especially those involving B 0 s mesons, which are not accessible at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance. These experiments have been terminated, whereas Belle is being upgraded [19]. Physics with b and c hadrons is now dominated by the LHCb experiment [20] at the LHC. The general-purpose detector experiments ATLAS [21] and CMS [22] contribute in selected areas, and the BESIII experiment [23] also provides many results for charm hadrons.",

Due to the complexity of long-distance strong interactions, it is easier to select processes with a limited number of hadrons in the initial or final state, or to select observables (typically ratios) for which uncertainties due to long-distance QCD effects cancel. In the first case, (exclusive) CP -conserving processes with at most one hadron in the initial and the final state are considered. After heavy degrees of freedom (in particular, weak gauge bosons) are integrated out using the effective Hamiltonian formalism [24], the long-distance hadronic contribution can be parametrised in terms of relatively simple quantities that are accessible through theoretical tools (lattice QCD simulations, effective field theories): decay constants for leptonic decays, form factors for semileptonic decays, bag parameters (matrix elements of four-quark effective operators between a meson and its antimeson) for neutral-meson mixing. It is often useful to consider ratios of observables related by SU (3) flavour symmetry, as many experimental and theoretical uncertainties decrease in such ratios. For a few (inclusive) processes, a sum over all possible final states is performed; quark-hadron duality can then be invoked to compute the effects of the strong interaction perturbatively. For this first type of observable, for which significant hadronic uncertainties must be assessed carefully, the resulting constraints are generally set on the modulus of a given CKM matrix element, and are dominated by theoretical uncertainties.",

Because the strong interaction conserves CP , the same hadronic amplitudes are involved and may cancel in well-designed observables such as CP asymmetries, measuring CP violation in hadron decays involving neutral-meson mixing, or in the interference between these two types of processes. This second type of observable, from which most of the hadronic uncertainties are absent, often yields information about one particular angle of the UT, dominated by experimental uncertainties. Large CP asymmetries are associated with the nonsquashed UT and thus occur mainly for B meson processes (often with small branching ratios due to CKM-suppressing factors). Table 1 summarises the processes for which a good accuracy can be reached both experimentally and theoretically. These processes are used to assess the validity of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism for CP violation and to perform the metrology of the CKM parameters, assuming the validity of the SM. Note that \u2206F = 2 meson mixing corresponds to a flavour-changing neutral current, and as such, it is forbidden at tree level and is only mediated by loop processes in the SM. By contrast, \u2206F = 1 decays can be either related to tree processes (typically, leptonic and semileptonic decays) or involve loop processes (such as hadronic decays).",

The inclusive determination [60][61][62][63][64] is more challenging. The full decay rate cannot be accessed, because a cut in the lepton energy must be performed to eliminate the huge b \u2192 c \u03bd background. The OPE must be modified, introducing poorly known shape functions describing the b quark dynamics in the B meson [65][66][67][68][69][70][71]. They can be constrained partly from B \u2192 X s \u03b3 and raise questions concerning the convergence rate of the series in 1/m b [72].",

The value of this branching ratio used to be at odds with expectations from global fits [77], but recent determinations from Belle reduced the discrepancy to 1.2\u03c3. In addition, the LHCb Collaboration recently used \u039b 0 b baryon decays for the first time [78]. The decay rates of \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd are compared to determine the ratio |V ub /V cb |, using the available lattice QCD estimates of the six different form factors involved [79].

It provides access to \u03d5 d [84], the relative phase between the decay of the B 0 meson to J/\u03c8 K 0 S and that of the oscillation of B 0 to its antiparticle B 0 , followed by the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S . The measurement requires studying how the decay depends on the time between the initial production of B 0 and its decay, leaving time for evolution and potential mixing between  and B 0 mesons. In the SM, the decay is dominated by a single CKM phase, up to Cabibbosuppressed penguin contributions, whereas B 0 mixing is completely dominated by top-top box diagrams. Considering these two amplitudes, the measurement of the time dependence of this process yields sin 2\u03b2 [84][85][86]. The B factories were optimised for this measurement [87][88][89] and determined [42] sin 2\u03b2 B-fact = 0.682 \u00b1 0.019, which is the most precise constraint on the UT ( Figure 6). Recently, LHCb joined the effort, publishing its first measurement of the time-dependent CP asymmetry in the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S [90] with an uncertainty competitive with the individual measurements from the B factories. The degeneracies among the values of \u03b2 are lifted thanks to the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 mode [91,92], where the interferences between the difference partial waves are sensitive to cos 2\u03b2.",

There have been several theoretical attempts to estimate this contribution. One possibility consists of using SU (3) symmetry and assessing the size of penguin contributions from B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 , and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S decays [94,95]; unfortunately, the accuracy of any constraints from these studies is currently limited due to the experimental inputs [96][97][98][99]. By contrast, a fit to B \u2192 J/\u03c8P (where P is a light pseudoscalar meson) including SU (3) breaking corrections suggests a small contamination from penguin contributions [100]. Direct computations based on soft-collinear effective theory arguments [101] reach a similar conclusion.

It requires the time-dependent study of b \u2192 u transitions as in B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, or B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, which are affected by b \u2192 d or b \u2192 s penguin topologies, depending on the final state considered. The interference between B 0 -B 0 mixing and decay amplitudes would provide a measurement of \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 = \u03b1 (using unitarity) in the absence of penguin contributions. In practice, this penguin pollution is present and must be constrained by determining the magnitude and the relative phases of hadronic amplitudes before determining the angle \u03b1, with the help of isospin symmetry [109,110]. For B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 [111][112][113][114][115][116][117], all three possible channels are considered, and isospin symmetry can be used to relate the hadronic amplitudes, leading to triangular relations. From the measurements of branching ratios and CP asymmetries, two triangles can be reconstructed for B + , B 0 and B \u2212 , B 0 decays, respectively, with a relative angle corresponding to \u03b1, up to discrete ambiguities. For the decay B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 [118][119][120][121][122][123][124], a similar construction can be invoked for the (dominant) longitudinal polarisation; interestingly, the penguin contamination turns out to be less important than for \u03c0\u03c0 modes. The decay B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 [123][124][125][126][127] requires a more elaborate analysis: Isospin symmetry yields pentagonal relations, whereas the timedependent B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 Dalitz plot analysis provides a large set of observables, corresponding to the parametrisation of the amplitude together with an isobar model involving the \u03c1 line shape. So far, a Dalitz plot analysis has been reported only for the decay mode B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay mode [128]. The present average of these constraints yields \u03b1 meas = (88.",

This is the least precisely known angle of the UT, and its determination from tree decays is considered to be free from contributions beyond the SM and unaffected by hadronic uncertainties, contrary to the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 [132].

Due to the pattern of CKM factors (suppressing charm contributions), \u2206m is dominated by the dispersive part of top quark-dominated box diagrams. It can be studied within an effective Hamiltonian analysis by integrating out heavy (W, Z, t, H) degrees of freedom: It amounts to a local contribution that requires the input of a single bag parameter once short-distance QCD corrections (gluon exchanges) have been taken into account [24,173]. This explains why the mass difference \u2206m has long been used to constrain the CKM parameters. By contrast, \u2206\u0393, related to the imaginary part of the amplitude, involves only real intermediate states. Therefore, it is dominated by the absorptive part of the box diagram involving the charm quark, namely the decays of P 0 andP 0 into common final states. The evaluation of this nonlocal contribution requires a further 1/m b expansion, with larger uncertainties and two hadronic bag parameters, making \u2206\u0393 (and a d,s SL ) harder to control theoretically [77,161,[174][175][176][177].",

The mass difference \u2206m K thus gets not only top box contributions but also charm-top and charm-charm contributions, which are long-distance contributions that are difficult to estimate [24,173]. A way out involves considering observables related to CP violation in K 0 mixing and decays into pions. In the absence of CP violation, only the short-lived kaon, K 0 S , decays into \u03c0\u03c0, whereas the long-lived kaon, K 0 L , decays into 3\u03c0. A measurement of CP violation can be defined from the amplitude of K 0 S and K 0 L states decaying into a \u03c0\u03c0 state with total isospin I = 0:",

            "text": "This term is related to the difference between CP eigenstates and mass eigenstates, and it requires a global fit to many observables describing K \u2192 2\u03c0 decays [25]. Its real part indicates CP violation in mixing, and its imaginary part measures CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay. K can be computed accurately in terms of short-distance (Inami-Lim) functions as well as a long-distance bag parameter, which is known from lattice QCD simulations [26]. An accurate SM prediction of K also requires a resummation of short-distance QCD corrections (gluon exchanges), encoded into \u03b7 tt , \u03b7 ct , and \u03b7 cc . These coefficients have been computed up to next-to-leading order (NLO) for \u03b7 tt [193] and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for \u03b7 ct and \u03b7 cc [194,195], the latter of which is still affected by large theoretical uncertainties. The interpretation in terms of the CKM parameters involves A,\u03c1, and\u03b7 (and is thus connected with |V cb |) and corresponds to a hyperbola in the (\u03c1,\u03b7) plane. Another interesting quantity is given by K , which is defined to measure CP violation in decays by comparing the rates of K 0 L and K 0 S decay into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . This quantity has been measured precisely [25,196,197] but is difficult to predict theoretically, as it receives dominant contributions from two four-quark operators (denoted Q 6 and Q 8 in the framework of the effective Hamiltonian) that largely cancel each other. A lattice QCD evaluation of all the bag parameters needed has recently been performed [198], suggesting a discrepancy between 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 with respect to SM expectations [198][199][200][201]. This interesting but challenging issue definitely calls for estimations of the relevant bag parameters from other lattice QCD collaborations.",

Additional, rare processes that are not expected to provide further constraints on the parameters of the SM can probe some of the underlying hypotheses at the core of this theory.

Several similar measurements, notably from LHCb, are ongoing and should provide a clearer picture in the near future. The violation of lepton flavour universality has also been investigated for the flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) transition b \u2192 s + \u2212 at several experiments. LHCb [203] measured the observable R K = Br(B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )/Br(B \u2192 Ke + e \u2212 ) in the dilepton mass range from 1 to 6 GeV 2 as 0.745 +0.090 \u22120.074 \u00b1 0.036, corresponding to a 2.6\u03c3 tension with its SM value, which is predicted to be equal to one (to high accuracy). This violation has also been studied in B \u2192 K * + \u2212 transitions, with R K * 0 measured in two low-q 2 bins with deviations from the SM between 2.2 and 2.5\u03c3 [210]. Other recent experimental results have shown interesting deviations from the SM in the muon sector. The LHCb analysis [211] of the decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 reports an \u223c 3\u03c3 anomaly in two large K * recoil bins of the angular observable P 5 [212]. This report was subsequently confirmed by the Belle experiment [213] with the hint that it would arise in b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 but not in b \u2192 se + e \u2212 [214]. Finally, the LHCb results for the branching ratio of several b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays exhibit deviations at low dilepton masses [215][216][217][218].",

The problem can be described as a series of observables (e.g., branching ratios of leptonic and semileptonic decays, mass difference for neutral mesons) depending on theoretical parameters. Some of these are of interest (A, \u03bb,\u03c1,\u03b7); the others are called nuisance parameters (e.g., decay constants, form factors, quark masses). The primary goal of statistical analysis is to determine the confidence intervals for the CKM parameters (and other fundamental parameters for models beyond the SM). The accuracy of the determination of the CKM parameters thus depends on the precision of the experimental measurements and on the theoretical computations of the nuisance parameters. Currently, global analyses are limited mainly by the latter, which are obtained mostly from QCD lattice simulations that consider a discretised version of QCD on a finite grid and compute correlators through Monte Carlo integrations over gluon gauge configurations. Due to the remarkable improvement in computing power and algorithms over recent decades, these computations are now dominated mainly by systematic uncertainties (extrapolation in lattice spacing, volume and quark masses, renormalisation).",

For lack of a better choice, and even though they are not of a statistical nature by definition, systematic uncertainties are often described with the same model as statistical uncertainties, for instance, in the case of the UTfit group [224]. Alternative treatments consist of determining sets of confidence intervals for specific values of the systematic uncertainties before combining them in unified confidence intervals [the scan method [225]] or building dedicated models for likelihoods and p values treating a range of values for the systematic uncertainties on an equal footing [the Rfit model used by the CKMfitter Collaboration [80]]. This choice has an effect not only when performing the global fit itself but also when choosing inputs by averaging measurements or computations from different groups.

The global fit also provides indirect predictions (i.e., not including direct measurements of these quantities) for quantities of interest, either measured experimentally or determined from lattice QCD simulations (Table 3). A similar level of accuracy is achieved for some observables in both their direct determinations and their indirect prediction. Improving their measurement will have only a limited impact on the fit, unless the central value differs significantly from the global fit expectations (which would then require a fine understanding of all sources of uncertainties of the measurements). Other quantities are still far from being measured as accurately as their prediction from the global fit. Their measurements can help further constrain the CKM parameters, and they still leave room for unexpected deviations from the SM picture emerging from the global fit.",

Two-dimensional scenarios with left-and right-handed couplings, either vector or scalar, are favoured.

Moreover, presently there are only a very limited number of observables (two ratios of branching ratios).

With only four parameters, this matrix is able to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as CP violation and rare decays. It can thus be constrained by many different processes, which have to be measured experimentally with high accuracy and computed with good theoretical control. After the first LEP measurements, the turn of the millennium has opened the B-factory era, leading to a remarkable improvement in the number and accuracy of the constraints set on the CKM matrix, which exhibit remarkable consistency and have led to a precise determination of the CKM parameters. The status presented in Section 3 is based on experiments up to and including the lifetime of the B factories, as well as LHC Run 1. The corresponding data sets have been almost fully exploited, whereas no updated measurements using data from the ongoing Run 2 are yet available. This situation will soon change, as the first Run 2 analyses will shortly be released by LHCb, ATLAS, and CMS. A change of gear is expected after the year 2020, when both Belle-II and the phase 1 upgraded LHCb experiment will collect data at much higher luminosities. The target is a multiplication of the data sets by up to two orders of magnitude [263,264]. In the case of LHCb, this includes the increase of the bb cross section at higher energies and an improved trigger [265]. A reduction of experimental uncertainties by factors of around 10 on the angles \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03d5 s is to be expected, as no irreducible systematic uncertainties are foreseen to affect the results in the foreseeable future.

The computation using lattice QCD simulations has already reached a very mature stage for some of the quantities described in Section 4, for instance, decay constants and form factors. At the accuracy obtained, some issues become relevant, such as the estimation of electromagnetic corrections, the detailed extrapolation in heavy-quark masses, and the kinematic range available for heavy to light form factors. Hopefully, the resulting improvement in the accuracy of the theoretical computations will resolve the puzzles currently affecting the determination of |V ub | and |V cb |. More generally, the experimental accuracy obtained for the individual constraints requires one to reassess some of the theoretical hypotheses commonly used to extract these quantities and add systematics that have been neglected up to now (e.g., sources of isospin breaking arising in the determination of \u03b1, penguin pollution for \u03b2). Other improvements can be expected concerning more exploratory domains, such as the matrix elements of operators beyond the SM (which are needed to analyse flavour constraints in NP models) or quantities involving hadrons difficult to access up to now-for instance, unstable mesons decaying under the strong interaction (e.g., \u03c1, K * ) or light or heavy baryons (e.g., nucleons, hyperons, \u039b 0 b ). Progress can also be expected from other theoretical methods (e.g., effective theories, dispersive approaches).
