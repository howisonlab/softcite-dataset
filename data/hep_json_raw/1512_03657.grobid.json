Production cross-sections for prompt as well as non-prompt sources, ratios of \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 production, and the fractions of nonprompt production for J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) are measured as a function of meson transverse momentum and rapidity. The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions.",

While Fixed-Order with Next-to-Leading-Log (FONLL) calculations [1,2], made within the framework of perturbative QCD, have been quite successful in describing non-prompt production of various quarkonium states, a satisfactory understanding of the prompt production mechanisms is still to be achieved.",

Within the colour-singlet model (CSM) [33], next-tonext-to-leading-order (NNLO) contributions to the hadronic production of S-wave quarkonia were calculated without introducing any new phenomenological parameters. However, technical difficulties have so far made it impossible to perform the full NNLO calculation, or to extend those calculations to the P-wave states. So it is not entirely surprising that the predictions of the model underestimate the experimental data for inclusive production of J/\u03c8 and \u03d2 states, where the feed-down is significant, but offer a better description for \u03c8(2S) production [18,34].",

            "text": "Neither the CSM nor the NRQCD model gives a satisfactory explanation for the measurement of prompt J/\u03c8 production in association with the W [39] and Z [40] bosons: in both cases, the measured differential cross-section is larger than theoretical expectations [41][42][43][44]. It is therefore important to broaden the scope of comparisons between theory and experiment by providing a variety of experimental information about quarkonium production across a wider kinematic range. In this context, ATLAS has measured the inclusive differential cross-section of J/\u03c8 production, with 2.3 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity [18], at \u221a s = 7 TeV using the data collected in 2010, as well as the differential cross-sections of the production of \u03c7 c states (4.5 fb \u22121 ) [14], and of the \u03c8(2S) in its J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u03c0 decay mode (2.1 fb \u22121 ) [9], at \u221a s = 7 TeV with data collected in 2011. The cross-section and polarization measurements from CDF [4], CMS [6,7,45,46], LHCb [8,10,12,[47][48][49] and ALICE [5,50,51], cover a considerable variety of charmonium production characteristics in a wide kinematic range (transverse momentum p T \u2264 100 GeV and rapidities |y| < 5), thus providing a wealth of information for a new generation of theoretical models.",

The ID covers the pseudorapidity 1 range |\u03b7| = 2.5 and is enclosed by a calorimeter system containing electromagnetic and hadronic sections. The calorimeter is surrounded by a large muon spectrometer (MS) in a toroidal magnet system.

Figure 12 shows the ratios of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) FONLL predictions to data, as a function of p T and in slices of rapidity, for centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For J/\u03c8, agreement is generally good, but the theory predicts slightly harder p T spectra than observed in the data. For \u03c8(2S), the shapes of data and theory appear to be in satisfactory agreement, but the theory predicts higher yields than in the data. There is no observed dependence on rapidity in the comparisons between theory and data for non-prompt J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) production.",

This measurement was carried out using 2.1fb \u22121 (11.4fb \u22121 ) of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV (8 TeV) recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.

For each increasing rapidity slice, an additional factor of 0.1 is applied to the plotted points for visual clarity. The top (bottom) row shows the 7 TeV (8 TeV) results. The centre of each bin on the horizontal axis represents the mean of the weighted p T distribution. The horizontal error bars represent the range of p T for the bin, and the vertical error bar covers the statistical and systematic uncertainty surements of the production of charmonium states made by ATLAS. In line with previous measurements, the central values were obtained assuming isotropic \u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decays. Correction factors for these cross-sections, computed for a number of extreme spin-alignment scenarios, are between \u221235 and +100 % at the lowest transverse momenta studied, and between \u221214 and +9 % at the highest transverse momenta, depending on the specific scenario.",

For the prompt production mechanism, the predictions from the NRQCD model, which includes colour-octet contributions with various matrix elements tuned to earlier collider data, are found to be in good agreement with the observed data points. For the non-prompt production, the fixed-order next-to-leading-logarithm calculations reproduce the data reasonably well, with a slight overestimation of the differential cross-sections at the highest transverse momenta reached in this analysis.  2.00    Fig. 13 The ratio of the 8 and 7 TeV differential cross-sections are presented for prompt (top) and non-prompt (bottom) J/\u03c8 (left) and \u03c8(2S) (right) for both data (red points with error bars) and theoretical predictions (green points).

In principle, the polarization may be non-zero and may vary with p T . In order to correct these measurements when well-measured J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) polarizations are determined, a set of correction factors are provided in Tables 4,  5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 for the 7 TeV data, and in the Tables 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 for the 8 TeV data.

For each new fit model, all measured quantities are recalculated, and in each p T and |y| interval the spread of variations around the central fit model is used as its systematic uncertainty. The variations of the fit model also account for possible uncertainties due to final-state radiation. The following variations to the central model fit are evaluated: \u2022 Signal mass model. Using double Gaussian models in place of the Crystal Ball plus Gaussian model; variation of the \u03b1 and n parameters of the B model, which are originally fixed; \u2022 Signal pseudo-proper decay time model. A double exponential function is used to describe the pseudo-proper decay time distribution for the \u03c8 non-prompt signal; \u2022 Background mass models. Variations of the mass model using exponentials functions, or quadratic Chebyshev polynomials to describe the components of prompt, nonprompt and double-sided background terms; \u2022 Background pseudo-proper decay time model. A single exponential function was considered for the non-prompt component; \u2022 Pseudo-proper decay time resolution model.
