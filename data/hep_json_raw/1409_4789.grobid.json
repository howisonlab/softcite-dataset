Data used for the analysis were collected by the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . Events are selected with an electron and muon with opposite charges that both have transverse impact parameter values between 0.02 and 2 cm. The search has been designed to be sensitive to a wide range of models with nonprompt e-\u03bc final states. Limits are set on the \"displaced supersymmetry\" model, with pair production of top squarks decaying into an e-\u03bc final state via R-parity-violating interactions. The results are the most restrictive to date on this model, with the most stringent limit being obtained for a top squark lifetime corresponding to c\u03c4 \u00bc 2 cm, excluding masses below 790 GeV at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Although the standard model (SM) has been successful at describing the known elementary particles and their interactions, it is considered to be a low-energy effective theory. Numerous experiments have conducted searches aimed at discovering extensions to the SM. These searches have generally assumed short particle lifetimes resulting in prompt decay signatures. However, since many models of physics beyond the standard model (BSM) predict particles with significant lifetimes [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], there have been some dedicated analyses that attempt to identify particles whose production vertices were displaced from the interaction region [9][10][11]. Recent results from experiments at the CERN LHC that constrain conventional BSM models have considerably increased the motivation to search for long-lived BSM particles [12].",

The search described in this Letter is distinct from these analyses in that it does not make any assumptions about the event topology beyond the requirement that the event contain an isolated electron and isolated muon with large impact parameters and opposite charges. It does not require, or exclude, hadronic activity or missing transverse energy (E T ). It does not require, or exclude, that the reconstructed displaced tracks form a vertex. It does not require that the displaced tracks are collimated. In this way, the analysis has sensitivity to a wide variety of still viable BSM scenarios that produce only pairs of displaced leptons with opposite charges.",

This model introduces large sparticle lifetimes via small R-parity-violating (RPV) couplings [2]. Consequently, the resultant decay products can be measurably displaced in the transverse plane relative to the proton beams. We consider the case in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is the top squark (t), which is produced in pairs and then decays through an RPV vertex,t \u2192 bl, where l is any charged lepton. The search does have sensitivity to leptonic tau decays, although the acceptance is suppressed by the small branching fraction of taus to leptons and by the soft p T spectrum of these leptons. The production mechanism is given entirely by the QCD of massive color triplet scalars and depends only on the stop mass and not on any other supersymmetric parameters. For simplicity we assume lepton universality in the top squark decay vertex. We conduct a search for an electron and a muon produced from different top squarks in the final state, with both of the leptons having large impact parameters. We restrict the search to include only tracks with impact parameter less than 2 cm, for which the CMS triggering and reconstruction algorithms have previously been optimized.",

Events were recorded with a trigger that requires a muon with p T > 22 GeV and a cluster in the ECAL with transverse energy E T > 22 GeV. No additional isolation requirements were applied to either object. The trigger efficiency for signal events passing the full selection is \u223c95% and does not vary significantly with top squark mass or lifetime. Events selected by the trigger are required to satisfy preselection criteria requiring a well-reconstructed electron and muon [27,28]. Electron candidates are reconstructed by combining information from deposits in the ECAL matched to tracks built by the Gaussian sum filter algorithm [28,29]. Muon candidates are built by separately constructing a track from the muon path through the tracking volume and one from its path through the muon systems, and then performing a global fit between the two [27]. Jets are constructed using the implementation of the anti-k T clustering algorithm available in FASTJET [30] with a size parameter of 0.5 [31] and are required to have transverse momentum p T > 10 GeV. We require both leptons to have p T > 25 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.5, where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity, and to pass the standard isolation requirements [27,28].

Additionally, each lepton is required to have a transverse impact parameter (d 0 ) greater than 0.01 cm, where d 0 is defined as the distance of closest approach in the transverse plane of the trajectory of the lepton track to the measured position of the center of the colliding proton beams.

When an unstable particle decays to charged particles, the impact parameter values of the tracks associated with the decay products will be strongly correlated with the lifetime of the parent. In order to be sensitive to a range of BSM particle lifetimes, we conduct this search in three nonoverlapping signal regions (SRn), defined in the 2D space of electron and muon d 0 . The SR3 region requires 0.1 < d 0 < 2 cm for both the electron and the muon and is expected to have very low SM background contamination. An event is classified in signal region SR2 if it fails the criteria of SR3 but both leptons have d 0 > 0.05 cm. An event is classified in signal region SR1 if it fails the criteria of both SR3 and SR2 but both leptons have d 0 > 0.02 cm. This last signal region is expected to contain more SM background, but has higher signal efficiency for the shortest BSM particle lifetimes to which this search is sensitive. For simulated signal events, the selection efficiency is as high as 20%, for top squark lifetimes near c\u03c4 \u00bc 1 cm. This efficiency does not depend significantly on the top squark mass but is strongly dependent on top squark lifetime.",

We define four regions corresponding to the following: isolated leptons whose charges have the opposite sign (iso OS); isolated leptons whose charges have the same sign (iso SS); opposite sign leptons that are both anti-isolated (anti-iso OS); and same sign leptons that are both anti-isolated (anti-iso SS).

The small contributions in these three regions from sources other than HF are subtracted using the simulation. We then calculate the ratio of the number of HF events in the iso SS region to the number of HF events in the anti-iso SS region. We construct a HF background data set by taking events in the anti-iso OS region and normalizing them to the iso OS region using this ratio. We use the impact parameter distributions from this data set, then apply the d 0 selections described above to obtain an estimate of the HF yield in the signal regions.

We perform this as a simultaneous counting experiment in three bins of the three search regions. We use a Bayesian calculation assuming a flat prior for the signal as a function of top squark mass. Nuisance parameters arising from statistical uncertainties are modeled as gamma distributions, while all others are modeled as log-normal distributions. These cross section limits are translated into upper limits on the top squark mass, where the cross section for each mass hypothesis is calculated at next-to-leading-order and next-to-leading-logarithmic precision within a simplified model with decoupled squarks and gluinos [49][50][51].

            "text": "In summary, a search has been performed for new physics with an electron and muon with opposite charges having a signature of large impact parameter values, with no requirements made on jets or missing transverse energy. No excess is observed above background for displacements up to 2 cm. While this search is expected to have sensitivity to a wide range of theoretical models, the results are interpreted in the context of a displaced supersymmetry model [1] with a pair-produced top squark having a lifetime between c\u03c4 \u00bc 0.02 cm and c\u03c4 \u00bc 100 cm. Limits are placed at 95% C.L. on this model as a function of top squark mass and lifetime. For a lifetime hypothesis of c\u03c4 \u00bc 2 cm, top squark masses up to 790 GeV are excluded. These are the most restrictive limits obtained to date on this model. TABLE I. Numbers of expected and observed events in the three search regions (see the text for the definitions of these regions). Background and signal expectations are quoted as N exp AE 1\u03c3\u00f0stat\u00de AE 1\u03c3\u00f0syst\u00de. If the estimated background is zero in a particular search region, the estimate is instead taken from the preceding region. Since this should always overestimate the background, we denote this by a preceding \"<\" symbol. FIG. 2 (color online). Expected and observed 95% C.L. cross section exclusion contours for top squark pair production in the plane of top squark lifetime (c\u03c4) and top squark mass. These limits assume a branching fraction of 100% through the RPV vertext \u2192 bl, where the branching fraction to any lepton flavor is equal to 1=3. As indicated in the plot, the region to the left of the contours is excluded by this search.",
