Searches for these MSSM Higgs bosons are presented, based on proton-proton collisions recorded in 2011 and 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. The neutral Higgs bosons are searched through their decays into pairs of oppositely charged tau leptons. The exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are shown as a function of the m A and tan \u03b2 parameters. The search for the charged Higgs bosons is based on their production through the decays of top quarks in the tt process, t \u2192 bH + . The Higgs bosons subsequently decay predominantly into a tau lepton and a neutrino. Upper limits are set on the branching fraction B(t \u2192 bH + ), combining the final states with leptonic and hadronic tau decay modes.",

In the Standard Model (SM), this mechanism requires the existence of a scalar particle: the Higgs boson [2]. The recent discovery of a particle compatible with the Higgs boson at the LHC [3] provides evidence in support of this picture. Even if this recently discovered particle is shown to have properties entirely consistent with the SM Higgs boson, there are still a number of problems not yet addressed by the SM. For instance, quantum corrections to the mass of the Higgs boson contain quadratic divergences. This problem can be solved by introducing supersymmetry, a symmetry between fermions and bosons, by which the divergent corrections to the Higgs boson mass are cancelled.",

            "text": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [4], two Higgs doublets are necessary, coupling separately to up-type and down-type fermions. This results in five physical Higgs bosons, two of which are neutral and CP-even (h, H), one of which is neutral and CPodd (A), and two of which are charged (H \u00b1 ). At tree level their properties can be described in terms of two parameters, typically chosen to be the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson, m A , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan \u03b2. In the MSSM, the Higgs boson couplings to \u03c4 leptons and b-quarks are strongly enhanced for a large part of the parameter space. This is especially true for large values of tan \u03b2, in which case the decay of a Higgs boson to a pair of \u03c4 leptons and its production in association with b-quarks play a much more important role than in the SM. a e-mail: stan.lai@cern.ch",

This particular channel uses the transverse mass, m T , of the \u03c4 had and E miss T system as a final discriminating variable. This distribution is shown in Figure 3. The shape and normalization of the m T distribution are obtained using data-driven techniques for multijet and backgrounds with true \u03c4 had leptons in the final state. For multijet background, this is obtained using a control sample where the requirements on \u03c4 had candidate isolation and the presence of a b-tagged jet have been lifted. For backgrounds with a true \u03c4 had lepton in the final state, the embedding method is used to determine the normalization and m T shapes, as in the ATLAS search.",
