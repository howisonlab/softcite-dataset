At the time of writing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is unconfirmed, no viable candidate for dark matter particle has been observed and the hierarchy of masses of particles is unnatural within the SM. Several of the proposed solutions to these problems result in the production of heavy resonances with masses accessible at the LHC. In these proceedings an overview of several searches for such resonances performed at the ATLAS experiment [1] is presented. Final states explored range from experimentally clean dilepton and diphoton states to quite challenging to analyze tt and diboson final states. Data presented here have been collected during the 2011 LHC run.",

            "text": "Heavy resonances decaying to a lepton-anti lepton pair are predicted by several extensions to the SM. These include neutral gauge boson Z [2][3][4], techni-mesons [5][6][7] and Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the Graviton in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [8]. In this analysis [9] the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) Z [3] is used as a benchmark model. In approximately 1 fb \u22121 two subsamples triggered on the presence of an energetic electron or a muon are selected. Events with two isolated electrons or muons are kept. Fig. 1 shows the dilepton mass distribution in both decay channels where the SM backgrounds have been normalized to data in the Z mass region. The test for a presence of a resonance is accomplished using a binned likelihood where systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters. The systematic uncertainties are due to variations of parton density functions (PDFs), QCD and weak K-factors, as well as trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies. Since the SM model prediction is normalized in the region of the Z pole mass only massdependent uncertainties are considered. No significant excess is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on cross section times branching ratio (\u03c3B) are computed a e-mail: wojtek.fedorko@cern.ch using Bayesian methodology using data from the two decay channels simultaneously. Observed lower limit on the mass of SSM Z is 1.83 TeV. Lower mass limits are also set on the E 6 family of Z models [2]. Limits are also set on the spin\u22120 KK excitation of the graviton. Shown in Tab. 1 are the lower mass limits on the E 6 -motivated Z bosons and RS gravitons. The upper limit on the SSM Z \u03c3B is re-interpreted [10] in the context of a techni-meson search. An area in the m(\u03c1 T /\u03c9 T ) \u2212 m(\u03c0 T ) plane excluded by the ATLAS data is shown in Fig. 2. It is worth pointing out that the excess observed in the CDF data [11] interpreted in the context of technicolor [12] is ruled out. For a splitting in technimeson masses of 100 GeV the lower limit on m \u03c1 is found to be 470 GeV.  ",

The final sample selection requires presence of two isolated photons where the invariant mass of the diphoton system exceeds 140 GeV. The invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 3. The dominant systematic uncertainties result from PDF variations, data-based procedure of reducible background estimation, and efficiency of photon selection criteria and efficiency extrapolation to high energies.

Triggered events require the presence of an energetic photon. In the final analysis the events with at least one isolated photon and at least one jet are considered. The photon must lie in the central region and away from any jets. The distribution of invariant mass m \u03b3 j of the photon and jet is examined using a procedure similar to the one used in the dijet resonance search. No significant excess is found and 95% CL upper limits q * \u03c3B . Excited quarks with mass less than 2.46 TeV are excluded. Upper limits are also set on production of a generic Gaussian photon-jet resonance as shown in Fig. 6 [GeV] ",

The tt decay topologies are selected utilizing isolated leptons, jets and missing transverse energy criteria. In the dilepton channel no explicit requirement is made on jet b-tagging is made while in the lepton+jets channel one b-tagged jet is required. In the dilepton channel the Z boson contribution and nontt contributions are rejected using dilepton mass cuts and H T (scalar sum of transverse energies of leptons and jets) cut. In the lepton+jets channel and iterative dRmin algorithm [27] is used to reject the ISR jets contribution. In the lepton+jets channel events with 3 jets are accepted allowing the decay products of the t quarks to be partially merged or fall outside of detector acceptance. Systematic uncertainties arise from reconstruction, identification and trigger efficiencies, jet energy scale and resolution, initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR), parton shower modeling, PDFs, tt event generation using different generators, luminosity and background cross section and b-tagging efficiency (in the lepton+jets channel). The distributions of H T + E miss T (shown in Fig. 7) in the dilepton channel and reconstructed tt mass (shown in Fig. 8) are analyzed for presence of a resonant excess. No excess is seen in either of the channels and g KK \u03c3B limits are set using Bayesian methodology. in the dilepton channel g KK is excluded up to mass of 0.84 TeV and in lepton+jets channels up to 0.65 TeV.  8 Search for a heavy particle decaying to two Z bosons A search for a heavy particle decaying into a pair of Z bosons is presented in [28]. Such resonances are predicted for instance in the RS warped extra dimensions model. Events with four isolated leptons are selected. The signal region for this search are the events where leptons form two opposite-sign same flavor pairs. Each pair is required to have the dilepton mass close to the Z boson mass and the four lepton mass m ZZ greater than 300 GeV. The distribution of m ZZ is shown in Fig. 9. The dominant systematic uncertainties arise from the lepton identification and reconstruction uncertainties. No excess in the signal region is observed and the \u03c3B limits are set using the CLs methodology excluding the RS KK graviton up to mass of 575 GeV for k/M Pl =0.1. It is worth pointing out that the excess observed at 327 GeV by the CDF experiment [29] is not confirmed. ",
