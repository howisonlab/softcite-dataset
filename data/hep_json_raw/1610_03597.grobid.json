The atmospheric neutrino background rate in Super-Kamiokande IV is reduced to almost half that of phase I-III by tagging neutrons associated with neutrino interactions. The reach of the proton lifetime is further enhanced by introducing new signal criteria that select the decay of a proton in a hydrogen atom. No candidates were seen in the p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 search. Two candidates that passed all of the selection criteria for p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 have been observed, but these are consistent with the expected number of background events of 0.87. Lower limits on the proton lifetime are set at \u03c4 /B(p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 ) > 1.6 \u00d7 10 34 years and \u03c4 /B(p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 ) > 7.7 \u00d7 10 33 years at 90% confidence level.",

Such a high energy scale is out of the reach of accelerators; however, a general feature of GUTs is their prediction of the instability of protons by baryon number violating decays. The grand unification idea is successful in many aspects; these include an understanding of electric charge quantization, the co-existence of quarks and leptons and their quantum numbers, and as an explanation of the scale of the neutrino masses. Proton decay now remains as a key missing piece of evidence for grand unification [2].",

            "text": "In GUTs, nucleon decay can proceed via exchange of a massive gauge boson between two quarks. The favored gauge-mediated decay mode in many GUTs is p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 . On the other hand, the flipped SU (5) GUT model [3] predicts that the p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 mode can have a branching ratio comparable to that of the p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 mode. Water Cherenkov detectors are suitable for these decay modes because all final state particles after the proton decay are detectable since they are above the Cherenkov threshold, enabling reconstruction of the proton mass and momentum to distinguish these events from atmospheric neutrino backgrounds. The dominant inefficiency comes from Fermi momentum of protons and pion interactions inside the nucleus, which distorts the reconstructed proton mass and momentum distributions. However, the two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule are outside of the oxygen nucleus; these act as free protons which are not subject to the nuclear effects. As a result, water Cherenkov detectors can achieve high efficiency for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 searches.",

However, longer lifetimes for this decay mode (\u223c 10 35 years) are predicted by other classes of GUTs e.g., minimal SUSY SU(5) [10], flipped SU (5)  [3], SO (10)  [11], etc., which are subject to experimental tests. The experimental searches for the gauge-mediated proton decays are further motivated by the discovery of a Higgs-like boson with a mass around 125 GeV/c 2 [12,13].

            "text": "Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a large upright cylindrical water Cherenkov detector, 39 m in diameter and 41 m in height, containing 50 ktons of pure water. Details of the detector have been described in Ref. [14]. The previous publication of p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 limits [9] reported results using 220 kiloton\u2022years exposure with 90% confidence level lower limits on the proton lifetime set at 1.3\u00d710 34 and 1.1\u00d710 34 years, respectively. In the SK-I period, the photocathode coverage inside the inner detector was 40%; this was reduced to 19% during SK-II. After production and installation of replacement 50-cm photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the photocathode coverage inside the detector was recovered to the original 40% in 2006. The period between July 2006 and September 2008 is defined as SK-III. In the summer of 2008, the detector readout electronics were upgraded with improved performance, including a \"deadtime free\" data acquisition system that records all successive PMT hit information [15]. This has been the configuration of the detector since September 2008; it is called SK-IV. The new configuration of the detector contributes to improved tagging efficiency of Michel decay electrons in SK-IV. The tagging efficiency of Michel electrons is estimated to be 99% for SK-IV and 82% for the period before SK-IV by using p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 MC samples. It also enables tagging of neutrons in SK-IV. The signature of the neutron, 2.2 MeV gamma ray emission from the neutron capture on hydrogen with a mean capture time of 200 \u00b5sec, is too faint to be triggered by the data acquisition system used in SK-I through SK-III. The upgraded electronics in SK-IV adopt a trigger-less readout scheme to record every hit, including all hits by 2.2 MeV gamma rays. A software trigger is then issued after every fully-contained event to save all hits within a 500 \u00b5sec timing window for physics analyses. In this paper, we use data from April 1996 up to March 2015, corresponding to 4973 live days or 306.3 kton\u2022years in total by summing up 91.7, 49.2, 31.9, 133.5 kton\u2022years of SK-I, II, III, and IV data.",

            "text": "Neutron tagging can benefit proton decay analyses, providing an additional handle for rejecting the atmospheric neutrino interactions that are the main background to proton decays. Atmospheric neutrino interactions are often accompanied by neutrons, while the probability of a neutron being emitted by deexcitation of a nucleus after proton decay is rather small, and no neutron is produced in the decay of a free proton. Furthermore, these proton decay modes do not produce neutrons in secondary interactions in water because the final state particles in these decay modes are lepton and gammas. The neutron tagging algorithm was originally developed to identify anti-neutrino interactions, in which a neutron is often emitted; the supernova relic neutrino search [16], the cosmic-ray-muon spallation background measurement [17], and the neutrino oscillation analysis [18] have been improved by this technique. To find 2.2 MeV \u03b3 candidates, we search for hit clusters with \u2265 7 hits within a 10 ns sliding time window, after time-of-flight (TOF) subtraction using the vertex of the prompt neutrino interaction. Sixteen variables described in Ref. [18] are input to a neural network to distinguish the 2.2 MeV \u03b3 signal from background. The efficiency of neutron tagging by this method is estimated to be 20.5\u00b12.1% with a mis-tagging probability of 1.8%. The performance of the neutron tagging was confirmed by introducing a neutron source (Americium-Beryllium) into the SK tank [16].",

For hadronwater interactions at energies below 3.5 GeV, our simulation uses the Nucleon-Meson-Transport-Code (NMTC), which is based on the Bertini intra-nuclear hadronic cascade model [21]. For low energy (< 20 MeV) neutron propagation, the Monte Carlo Ionization Chamber Analysis Package (MICAP) code [22] is employed. Thermalized neutrons are then simulated until capture on hydrogen and emission of 2.2 MeV \u03b3-rays. Neutrons can also be generated via the deexcitation process and muon capture in water. These are not taken into account in our atmospheric neutrino simulation, but are instead included in our uncertainty by comparison of data and atmospheric \u03bd Monte Carlo.

NEUT also simulates the pion final state interactions (\u03c0-FSI). The NEUT \u03c0-FSI model is a microscopic cascade where the pion is propagated classically through the nuclear medium in finite steps; it is capable of simulating various nuclei. The \u03c0-FSI model has been tuned to various \u03c0 \u00b1 -nucleus experimental data including C, O, Al, Fe, and has been updated [25] since the previous paper [9]. The left panel in Figure 1 shows the \u03c0 + cross sections of the external data and MC on 12 C [26], which has the largest number of data points. After tuning, the estimated rates of neutral pion absorption and charge exchange have increased around 500 MeV/c, which affects the distribution of the number of rings and causes a 5% reduction of estimated signal efficiency. Large angle scattering in the nucleus has also increased, which modifies the reconstructed proton mass and momentum distributions, resulting in a 7% reduction in estimated selection efficiency for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 .

The region below 100 MeV/c is dominated by free protons, and the region 100 \u2264 P tot < 250 MeV/c is dominated by bound protons. A reduced systematic error for < 100 MeV/c can be achieved because the initial protons and the products of the proton decay do not suffer from any of the various nuclear interactions. In addition, background contamination from atmospheric neutrinos is concentrated in the 100 \u2264 P tot < 250 MeV/c, while the region below 100 MeV/c is nearly background free. Figure 3 shows the reconstructed proton mass vs. total momentum distribution for signal and atmospheric \u03bd MC, combining all data from SK-I through SK-IV. In the signal MC plots, the light blue dots show the free proton case and the dark blue dots show bound protons. Figure 4 shows one-dimensional distributions of reconstructed proton mass and momentum of p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 for the signal, atmospheric \u03bd MC, and data after all cuts except the cut on the plotted variable. The data and the atmospheric \u03bd MC agree in both cases. The new two-box analysis achieves better discovery reach. For example, the 3\u03c3 discovery reach in the proton lifetime for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 is 13.3% higher than the conventional single-box analysis for the current exposure, and 20.9% higher for an exposure of 1 megaton\u2022year, which may be achieved by the next generation of detectors [30].",

RESULTS Table I shows efficiency, expected number of background events, and number of observed events for each region of total momentum for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 . The signal efficiencies in SK-I and -II are decreased in comparison to the previous paper due to the updated \u03c0-FSI model. Efficiencies for p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 in SK-IV are significantly higher than the other data-taking periods because of Michel electron tagging efficiency that was achieved with the new electronics. The background rate in SK-I/II/III is consistent with the measurement in the 1 kton water Cherenkov detector using the K2K accelerator neutrino beam [31]. Background rates in SK-IV for both decay modes are almost half that of SK-I/II/III, which is a result of the contribution from neutron tagging. In the entire signal region, with 306.3 kiloton\u2022years exposure, the expected background for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 is 0.61 events (0.07 and 0.54 events in lower and higher momentum box, respectively) and no candidates were observed, while for p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 the estimated background is 0.87 events (0.05 and 0.82 events in lower and higher momentum box, respectively) and two candidates have been observed in the higher momentum box. Assuming a Poisson distribution with mean 0.87, the probability to see \u2265 2 events is 22% and is still consistent with background. The first candidate was observed at 257 kton\u2022years exposure and the second candidate was observed at 277 kton\u2022years exposure. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is carried out to examine the assumption of a constant event rate. The obtained p-value is 5.2%, which is consistent with the assumption. Table II shows a summary of the systematic errors. The dominant systematic uncertainty in the efficiency of both decay modes in the P tot <100 MeV/c region comes from uncertainty in the Fermi momentum. In the proton decay MC, the momentum distribution of the bound nucleon is simulated based on experimental data [32], which is compared with the Fermi gas model to estimate the uncertainty. Uncertainties in energy scale, uniformity of the detector, particle identification, vertex shift, opening angle, and ring counting are all taken into account as reconstruction error. Uncertainties in the 100\u2264 P tot <250 MeV/c region are generally larger because they are mostly bound protons that suffer from uncertainties associated with \u03c0-FSI, correlated decays with other nucleons [33], and Fermi motion. The leading uncertainties in the background estimate come from cross section, \u03c0-FSI, and reconstruction. An additional systematic error for neutron tagging is assigned only for SK-IV. As shown in Figure 2 and Ref. [18], neutron multiplicity in atmospheric neutrino data and MC agree well. Also, as described in Section III, the data with neutron source is compared with MC in several detector positions. The systematic error on neutron tagging is assigned to be 10% estimated by the maximum deviation between data and MC. The run time of SK is well defined and systematic uncertainty in the exposure is negligibly small (1%).",

The first candidate has a reconstructed proton mass of 903\u00b119 MeV/c 2 and 248\u00b15 MeV/c total momentum. The first candidate is categorized as a two-ring event; the e-like ring has momentum 375 MeV/c, the \u00b5-like ring has 551 MeV/c momentum, and there is a 158 degree opening angle between the two rings. For the second candidate, the ring counting algorithm originally found one \u00b5-like ring and two e-like rings. However, one of e-like rings (orange ring in Figure 5) is judged as a fake ring at the final stage of ring counting. This final stage discards rings caused by multiple coulomb scattering of charged particles, which is done by examination of a ring's angle relative to other rings and by visible energy; it is applied to both data and MC. As a result, the second candidate is judged as a two-ring event. In the final result of the reconstruction, the second candidate has a reconstructed proton mass of 832\u00b117 MeV/c 2 and a total momentum of 238\u00b15 MeV/c calculated from the remaining e-like ring with 461 MeV/c, the \u00b5-like ring with 391 MeV/c, and the 149 degree angle between the two rings. If the third ring had not been rejected, the reconstructed invariant mass from the two e-like rings would have been 104 MeV/c 2 , which could be gammas from \u03c0 0 decay. The total momentum and proton mass would increase to 289 MeV/c and 880 MeV/c 2 , respectively, which would move the event outside of the defined signal region 1 .",

For measurements i = 1 \u2212 4 (P tot < 100MeV/c, SK-I-SK-IV) and 5 \u2212 8 (100 \u2264 P tot < 250 MeV/c, SK-I-SK-IV), the conditional probability distribution for the decay rate is expressed as:",

Neutron tagging was introduced in SK-IV and it succeeds in rejecting half of the backgrounds. The signal region from SK-I to SK-IV was divided into two regions of P tot to obtain better sensitivity. We observed 0 events (0.07 and 0.54 expected background in lower and higher momentum box, respectively) for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and 2 events in the higher momentum box (0.05, and 0.82 expected background in lower and higher momentum box, respectively) for p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 . The obtained proton lifetime limits at 90% confidence level are > 1.6 \u00d7 10 34 years for p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 and > 7.7 \u00d7 10 33 years for p \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 0 .",
