The leading candidates, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), can be directly detected by looking for WIMP-nucleus scattering events in deep underground laboratories. In recent years, experiments using the so-called dual-phase xenon techniques have been continuously pushing the exclusion limits of the elastic WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section [1][2][3][4][5], into the parameter space predicted by various theoretical models [6].",

            "text": "PandaX-II reuses most of the infrastructures of PandaX-I. The most significant upgrades are the new inner vessel constructed from stainless steel with much lower radioactivity, reducing the 60 Co activity by more than an order of magnitude, and a much larger xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The cylindrical TPC, as shown in Fig. 1, contains 580 kg LXe in the sensitive volume enclosed by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflective panels with an inner diameter of 646 mm and a maximum drift length of 600 mm. The drift field is defined by a cathode mesh (200-\u00b5m wire diameter with 5-mm pitch) placed at the bottom of the TPC and gate grid (100-\u00b5m wire diameter with 5-mm pitch) 5.5 mm below the liquid level. The liquid level can be adjusted remotely via an overflow mechanism. The extraction field, which extracts electrons in liquid xenon into the gas region at the liquid-gas interface, is produced between the gate grid and the anode mesh located 5.5 mm above the liquid level with the same construction as the cathode. During the commissioning run, a voltage of \u221229 kV and \u22124.95 kV was applied to the cathode and gate, respectively, and the anode was kept at ground, resulting in a drift field of 393.5 V/cm (with spatial variation of about 0.77% in the fiducial volume) in LXe, and an extraction eld of 4.4 kV/cm in the gaseous xenon right above the liquid surface. Right outside the side PTFE panels, 58 Cu shaping rings are mounted to guarantee the uniformity of the drift field. A skin (surface layer) LXe volume with a thickness of about 40 mm is confined between the inner PTFE and a layer of outer PTFE panels. Two identical arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were placed above and below the TPC, respectively, each consisting of 55 Hamamatsu-R11410 3-inch PMTs, to detect scintillation photons in the sensitive volume. The top PMT array is placed 46 mm above the anode, and the bottom array is located 66 mm below the cathode. A screen grid (200-\u00b5m wire diameter with 5-mm pitch), set at ground, is placed 6 mm above the bottom PMT array to shield the cathode high-voltage. Two additional PMT arrays are located at same heights as the 3-in arrays, each with 24 Hamamatsu-R8520-406 1-inch PMTs, to produce veto signals in the skin volume to suppress background events due to ambient gamma rays. The PMT voltage divider for the 3-in PMTs uses a split positive and negative HV (\u223c \u00b1650 V) scheme to reduce the relative potential to the ground [15]. The average random PMT rates (\"dark count rate\") for the R11410 PMTs were measured to be \u223c0.5 kHz, significantly improved from PandaX-I [16]. Same as that in PandaX-I, the signals from each PMT are amplified by a factor of 10, then get fed into the 100 MHz digitizer channels.",

[10], converting information from the raw waveforms of individual PMTs into photoelectrons and timing for S1s and S2s, vertex position, etc. The distortion of the mean waveform amplitude when there is no signal (baseline) induced by some large signals is corrected in software. The single photoelectron gain (or PMT gain) is obtained by integrating the area of the waveform below the baseline for the single photoelectron signals. PMT gains are calibrated by activating LEDs inside the detector twice a week. The average PMT gain is 1.1 \u00d7 10 6 . After the gain correction, a threshold of 0.25 PE/sample in amplitude, roughly corresponding to a single channel threshold of 0.5 PE, is used for finding PMT hits from each waveform. Clusters of time correlated hits are grouped into individual signals, which are tagged into either S1 signal, S2 signal or noise based on the shape of the summed waveform over all channels. The discrimination between S1 and S2 signals relies on the full-width-10%-maximum and the \"roughness\" of the waveform. At least three PMT hits are required for a valid S1 signal to suppress random coincidence among PMTs. Veto PMTs hits are not used in the clustering. However any hit in the veto array that occurs during the entire width of an S1 signal, will veto an event. The threshold to generate a veto was estimated to be \u223c150 keV ee in the skin region from a comparison between the data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.",

Selection cuts are also set on the top-bottom ratio of S2 signals to remove spurious events located at the very edge and potential misidentified noises. In a given waveform, the maximum number of S1-like signals passing all quality cuts is limited to two, and the maximum one is chosen to pair with S2. To suppress events with incorrectly associated S1 and S2, the vertical location encoded by the top-bottom asymmetry in S1 is required to be consistent with that from the drift time.

The 164 keV \u03b3 events were uniformly distributed in the detector and were used to produce a uniformity correction for the S1 and S2 signals. A 3-D correction map was produced for S1. For the S2 signals, the vertical uniformity correction was obtained by fitting S2 vs. the drift time using an exponential decay constant \u03c4 , known as the electron lifetime. As expected, \u03c4 improved over time due to continuous xenon purification from 240\u00b5s to 552\u00b5s with an average of 324\u00b5s during the entire run.

PDE, the photon-detection efficiency, EEE, the electron extraction efficiency, and SEG, the single-electron gain in PE/e, are the three key detector parameters to be determined. To obtain SEG, the smallest S2 signals in the data were identified as the single electron signals. Their photoelectron distribution was fit with a Gaussian function, from which SEG= 22.1 \u00b1 0.7 with a resolution \u03c3 =7.41 PE/e was obtained. To extract the other two parameters, the peak values of S1/E ee and S2/E ee are plotted for all \u03b3 peaks (Fig. 2), where the true energy of the \u03b3s are taken as E ee . A linear fit is then performed on the data points. The scattering of data points along the line indicates systematic effects such as the non-uniformity and nonlinearity in S1 and S2. The best fit values, PDE = 11.7%, EEE = 48.1%, were compared with those obtained by taking the ratio of the observed peaks in S1 and S2 to the expected yield of photons and electrons from the NEST model [20]. The difference leads to a relative uncertainty of 5.6% in PDE and 7.1% in EEE.",

In total, 547 NR events are identified for S1 between 3 to 45 PE in the FV. The MC predictions of the NR signal distribution were obtained from a combination of Geant4-based program and the NEST model with the extracted PDE, EEE, and SEG from calibration. In simulating photoelectrons, results from Ref. [21] were used to incorporate double photoelectron emissions from the 3-in PMTs. Vertical uniformity in S2 due to electron lifetime in the data and the S2 trigger threshold were also considered in the MC. The median value of the MC is compared to the data in Fig. 3. A much better agreement can be achieved by tuning the ratio of the initial number of excitation and ionization by a factor of 1.5 in NEST. The width of the NR band in the tuned MC also agrees with the data. Therefore, we adopted the tuned MC as the default model to predict the WIMP NR distributions. The NR efficiency was evaluated by a comparison between the data and MC on the event 2-D distribution in (S1, S2), leading to a parametrization = 0.94 e \u2212 S1\u22126.21",

The energy independent factor, 0.94, was obtained by choosing high energy NR events with S1>20 PE and within \u00b13\u03c3 of the NR band, and removing the selection cuts. We identified two major effects which accounted for the efficiency loss at low recoil energy. First, due to the high rate (\u223c160 Hz) from the 252 Cf calibration source, the efficiency is significantly reduced by the presence of random single electron S2 signals. If the real S1 is small and the single electron S2 is mis-identified into multiple small S1 signals, the S1-S2 pairing algorithm would be ineffective and the event would be vetoed. In addition, the loss due to the three-fold PMT coincidence was also found to be significant due to multi-photoelectron emission in the R11410 phototubes [21]. The NR efficiency in Eqn. 2 is conservatively taken as the dark matter detection efficiency. ",

The lowest cross section limit obtained is 2.97\u00d710 \u221245 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 44.7 GeV/c 2 , which represents an improvement of more than a factor of three from PandaX-I, and even more in the low WIMP mass region. The major improvements include the exposure (a factor of \u223c1.35), the photon de-tection (PDE 11.7% vs. 9.6%), the S2 selection cut (9.4 e vs 19.7 e, although in PandaX-II a significant depth dependent efficiency variation is present due to the electron lifetime), the S1 window ( [3,45] vs. [2,30] PE), and the expected background (3.2 vs. 6.9 events). The cross section limit at WIMP mass of 10, 100, and 300 GeV/c 2 are 8.43\u00d710 \u221244 , 4.34\u00d710 \u221245 , and 1.13\u00d710 \u221244 cm 2 , respectively. At low WIMP mass region down to 5 GeV/c 2 , our exclusion limit is competitive with SuperCDMS [27]. At high WIMP mass region, our results are within a factor of \u223c1.5 to the final 225-day XENON100 results [3], although with only 19.1 days of live-time. However, our results do not quite scale with the LUX results (with a factor of 2.4 of exposure) [5] primarily due to the high krypton background.
