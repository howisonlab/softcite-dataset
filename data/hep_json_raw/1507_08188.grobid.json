We extract the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section in the energy range between 600 and 900 MeV, exploiting the method of initial state radiation. A data set with an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb \u22121 taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider is used. The cross section is measured with a systematic uncertainty of 0.9%. We extract the pion form factor |F \u03c0 | 2 as well as the contribution of the measured cross section to the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to (g \u22122) \u03bc .

More recently, the two most precise measurements have been performed by the KLOE Collaboration in Frascati [8] and the BaBar Collaboration at SLAC [9,10]. Both experiments claim a precision of better than 1% in the energy range below 1 GeV, in which the \u03c1(770) resonance with its decay into pions dominates the total hadronic cross section. A discrepancy of approximately 3% on the peak of the \u03c1(770) resonance is observed between the KLOE and BaBar spectra. The discrepancy is even increasing towards higher energies above the peak of the \u03c1 resonance. Unfortunately, this discrepancy is limiting the current knowledge of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a \u03bc \u2261 (g \u2212 2) \u03bc /2 [11], a precision observable of the Standard Model (SM). The accuracy of the SM prediction of (g \u2212 2) \u03bc is entirely limited by the knowledge of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution, which is obtained in a dispersive framework by using experimental data on \u03c3 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons) [11][12][13]. The cross section \u03c3 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) contributes to more than 70% to this dispersion relation and, hence, is the most important exclusive hadronic channel of the total hadronic cross section.

However, the discrepancy reduces to 2.4\u03c3 [14], when only BaBar data is used as input to the dispersion relation. In this letter we present a new measurement of the cross section \u03c3 \u03c0\u03c0 , obtained by the BESIII experiment at the BEPCII collider in Beijing. The measurement exploits the method of initial state radiation (ISR), the same method as used by BaBar and KLOE. In the ISR method events are used in which one of the beam particles radiates a high-energy photon. In such a way, the available energy to produce a hadronic (or leptonic) final state is reduced, and the hadronic (or leptonic) mass range below the center-of-mass (cms) energy of the e + e \u2212 collider becomes available. In this paper, we restrict the studies to the mass range between 600 and 900 MeV/c 2 , which corresponds to the \u03c1 peak region.",

We require the presence of two charged tracks in the MDC with net charge zero. The points of closest approach to the interaction point (IP) of both tracks have to be within a cylinder with 1 cm radius in the transverse direction and \u00b110 cm of length along the beam axis. For three-track events, we choose the combination with net charge zero for which the tracks are closest to the IP.

Events are considered to match the hypothesis if they fulfill the requirement \u03c7 2 4C < 60. It turns out that the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 final state cannot be suppressed by means of kinematic fitting due to the limited momen-tum resolution of the MDC. An independent separation of pion and muon tracks is required. We utilize a track-based muon-pion separation, which is based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method, as provided by the TMVA package [23]. The following observables are exploited for the separation: the Zernicke moments of the EMC clusters [22], induced by pion or muon tracks, the ratio of the energy E of a track deposited in the EMC and its momentum p measured in the MDC, the ionization energy loss dE/dx in the MDC, and the depth of a track in the MUC. The ANN is trained using \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 MC samples. We choose the implementation of a Clermont-Ferrand Multilayer Perceptron (CFMlp) ANN as the method resulting in the best background rejection for a given signal efficiency. The output likelihood y ANN is calculated after training the ANN for the signal pion tracks and background muon tracks. The response value y ANN is required to be greater than 0.6 for each pion candidate in the event selection, yielding a background rejection of more than 90% and a signal loss of less than 30%.",

We have investigated data and MC distributions concerning the tracking performance, the energy measurement, and the PID probabilities, both for the electron PID as well as the pion-muon separation. In order to produce test samples of muon and pion tracks over a wide range in momentum/energy and polar angle, we select samples of \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 events that have impurities at the per mille level. By comparing the efficiencies found in data with the corresponding results found in the MC samples, we determine possible discrepancies. Corresponding correction factors are computed in bins of the track momentum or energy and the track polar angle \u03b8 , and are applied to MC tracks to adjust the reconstructed number of events. While for the reconstruction of charged tracks and neutral clusters and for electron PID, the differences between data and MC are smaller than 1% on average, differences up to 10% occur in the ANN case. The corrections are applied separately for neutral clusters and for muon and pion tracks. Hence, we do not only obtain the corrections for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 signal events, but also for the dominating \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 background. The statistical errors of the correction factors are included in the statistical uncertainty of the measurement. Systematic uncertainties associated to the correction factors are presented in Sect. 6.5. The efficiency correction for the photon efficiency is obtained after the application of the kinematic fit procedure. The corresponding correction is therefore a combined correction of photon efficiency and differences between data and MC of the \u03c7 2 4C distribution.

It includes vacuum polarization corrections, but, differently from the cross section shown in Fig. 3, final state radiation effects are excluded here. The red line in Fig. 4 illustrates a fit to data according to a parametrization proposed by Gounaris and Sakurai [32]. Here, exactly the same fit formula and fit procedure are applied as described in detail in Ref. [10]. Free parameters of the fit are the mass and width of the \u03c1 meson, the mass of the \u03c9 meson, and the phase of the Breit-  Table 3 Fit parameters and statistical errors of the Gounaris-Sakurai fit of the pion form factor. Also shown are the PDG 2014 values [33]. Wigner function c \u03c9 = |c \u03c9 |e i\u03c6 \u03c9 . The width of the \u03c9 meson is fixed to the PDG value [33]. The resulting values are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, the resonance parameters are in agreement with the PDG values [33] within uncertainties, except for \u03c1 , which shows a 3.4\u03c3 deviation. Corresponding amplitudes for the higher \u03c1 states, \u03c1(1450), \u03c1(1700), and \u03c1(2150), as well as the masses and widths of those states were taken from Ref. [10], and the systematic uncertainty in \u03c1 due to these assumptions has not been quantitatively evaluated. The Gounaris-Sakurai fit provides an excellent description of the BESIII data in the full mass range from 600 to 900 MeV/c 2 , resulting in \u03c7 2 /ndf = 49.1/56. Fig. 5 shows the difference between fit and data. Here the data points show the statistical uncertainties only, while the shaded error band of the fit shows the systematic uncertainty only. In order to compare the result with previous measurements, the relative difference of the BESIII fit and data from BaBar [10], KLOE [6][7][8], CMD2 [1,2], and SND [3] is investigated. Such a comparison is complicated by the fact, that previous measurements used different vacuum polarization corrections. Therefore, we consistently used the vacuum polarization correction from Ref. [31] for all the comparisons discussed in this section. The KLOE 08, 10, 12, and BaBar spectra have, hence, been modified accordingly. The individual comparisons are illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Here, the shaded error band of the fit includes the systematic error only, while the uncertainties of the data points include the sum of the statistical and systematic errors. We observe a very good agreement with the KLOE 08 and KLOE 12 data sets up to the mass range of the \u03c1-\u03c9 interference. In the same mass range the BaBar and KLOE 10 data sets show a systematic shift, however, the deviation is, not exceeding 1 to 2 standard deviations. At higher masses, the statistical error bars in the case of BESIII are relatively large, such that a comparison is not conclusive. There seem to be a good agreement with the BaBar data, while a large deviation with all three KLOE data sets is visible. There are indications that the BE-SIII data and BESIII fit show some disagreement in the low mass and very high mass tails as well. We have also compared our results in the \u03c1 peak region with data from Novosibirsk. At lower and higher masses, the statistical uncertainties of the Novosibirsk results are too large to draw definite conclusions. The spectra from SND and from the 2006 publication of CMD-2 are found to be in very good agreement with BESIII in the \u03c1 peak region, while the 2004 result of CMD-2 shows a systematic deviation of a few percent.",

The energy dependence of the cross section appears compatible with corresponding measurements from KLOE and BaBar within approximately one standard deviation. The two-pion contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u03bc has been determined from the BESIII data to be a \u03c0\u03c0,LO \u03bc (600-900 MeV) = (368.2 \u00b1 2.5 stat \u00b1 3.3 sys ) \u2022 10 \u221210 . By averaging the KLOE, BaBar, and BESIII values of a \u03c0\u03c0,LO \u03bc and assuming that the five data sets are independent, a deviation of more than 3\u03c3 between the SM prediction of (g \u2212 2) \u03bc and its direct measure-ment is confirmed. For the low mass region < 600 MeV/c 2 and the high mass region > 900 MeV/c 2 , the BaBar data was used in this calculation.",
