We show that this hypothesis can be tested with a PBq (ten kilocurie scale) 144 Ce or 106 Ru antineutrino \u03b2-source deployed at the center of a large low background liquid scintillator detector. In particular, the compact size of such a source could yield an energy-dependent oscillating pattern in event spatial distribution that would unambiguously determine neutrino mass differences and mixing angles.",

            "text": "Most results from neutrino experiments over the last twenty years can be quite accurately described by a model of oscillations between three \u03bd flavors (\u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 , \u03bd \u03c4 ) that are mixtures of three massive neutrinos (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 ) separated by squared mass differences of \u2206m 2 21 = 8 \u2022 10 \u22125 eV 2 and \u2206m 2 31 = 2.4 \u2022 10 \u22123 eV 2 [1]. In the past the LSND experiment suggested the existence of a fourth massive neutrino with a mass of \u223c1 eV 2 [5]. This evidence has been confirmed by the MiniBoone experiment in the antineutrino sector [6]. Recently the hypothetical existence of a fourth \u03bd has been revived by a new calculation [2] of the rate of\u03bd e production by nuclear reactors that yields a \u03bd flux about 3% higher than previously predicted. This calculation then implies [3] that the measured event rates for all reactor \u03bd e experiments within 100 meters of the reactor are about 6% too low. The deficit can also be explained by a hypothetical fourth massive \u03bd separated from the three others by |\u2206m 2 new | > 0.1 eV 2 . This mixing can explain a similar deficit in the rate of \u03bd interactions in Gallium solar-\u03bd detectors when exposed to artificial 51 Cr and 37 Ar MCi sources [4]. Combination of [3] and [4] deficits is significant at the 99.8% C.L., though no conclusive model can explain all data [7]. In this letter we propose an unambiguous search for this fourth neutrino by using a 1.85 PBq (50 kCi) antineutrino source deployed at the center of a kilo-ton scale detector such as Borexino [9], KamLAND [11], or SNO+ [15]. Antineutrino detection will be made via the inverse beta-decay (IBD) reaction \u03bd e + p \u2192 e + +n. The delayed coincidence between detection of the positron and the neutron capture gamma rays will allow for a nearly background free experiment. The small size (\u223c10 g) of the source compared to the size a nuclear reactor core may allow the observation of the characteristic \u03bd-oscillation pattern of event positions.",

There are two options for deploying \u03bd sources in LS: monochromatic \u03bd e emitters, like 51 Cr or 37 Ar, or\u03bd e emitters with a continuous \u03b2-spectrum. In the first case, the signature is provided by \u03bd e elastic scattering off electrons in the LS molecules. This signature can be mimicked by Compton scattering induced by radioactive and cosmogenic background, or by Solar-\u03bd interactions. The constraints of an experiment with \u03bd e impose the use of a very high activity source (5-10 MCi) outside of the detector target. In the second option,\u03bd e are detected via inverse beta decay. Its signature, provided by the e + -n delayed coincidence, offers an efficient rejection of the mentioned background.

While not minimizing the difficulty of doing this, the nuclear industry does have the technology to produce sources of the appropriate intensity, at the ppm purity level. In fact, 10 kCi 90 Sr sources have been produced and used industrially for heat generation. Delays obtaining authorizations for transportation and deployment of the source into an underground laboratory should be addressed at the start of the project. For this paper, we concentrate on the 144 Ce source (Fig. 1) because its Q \u03b2 is greater than that of 90 Sr and because it is easier to extract chemically than 106 Ru. We note also that it has a very low production rate of highenergy \u03b3 rays (> 1M eV ) from which the\u03bd e detector must be shielded to limit background events.

We anticipate the need of an external layer of ultrapure copper, set to 2 cm in our simulation. It allows one to achieve the radiopurity and material compatibility requirements. Assuming a \u223c4 tons shield we consider a prompt and delayed event rates of 50 Hz and 25 Hz, respectively. The escaping \u03b3 are attenuated in the LS, assuming a 20 cm attenuation length [14]. Beyond a distance of 1.5 m from the source the backgrounds become negligible. Any of the bremsstrahlung photons or shielding backgrounds can account for either the prompt or delayed event, depending on their energy. The sum of the backgrounds integrated over their energy spectrum is shown on Fig. 3, supporting the case of kCi\u03bd e source versus MCi \u03bd e source for which solar-\u03bd's become an irreducible background. A light doping of the LS with gadolinium or an oil buffer surrounding the shielding would further suppress backgrounds; finally, non-source backgrounds could be measured in-situ during a blank run with an empty shielding.",
