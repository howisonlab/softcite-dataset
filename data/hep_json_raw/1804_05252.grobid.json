Data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC are used that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.19 fb \u22121 . The cross section is measured as a function of the jet multiplicity and its dependence on the transverse momentum of the Z boson, the jet kinematic variables (transverse momentum and rapidity), the scalar sum of the jet momenta, which quantifies the hadronic activity, and the balance in transverse momentum between the reconstructed jet recoil and the Z boson. The measurements are compared with predictions from four different calculations. The first two merge matrix elements with different parton multiplicities in the final state and parton showering, one of which includes oneloop corrections. The third is a fixed-order calculation with next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy for the process with a Z boson and one parton in the final state. The fourth combines the fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of the process with no parton in the final state with next-to-next-to-leading logarithm resummation and parton showering.",

            "text": "Measurements of vector boson production in association with jets provide fundamental tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The high centre-of-mass energy at the CERN LHC allows the production of an electroweak boson along with a large number of jets with large transverse momenta. A precise knowledge of the kinematic distributions in processes with large jet multiplicity is essential to exploit the potential of the LHC experiments. Comparison of the measurements with predictions motivates additional Monte Carlo (MC) generator development and improves our understanding of the prediction uncertainties. Furthermore, the production of a massive vector boson together with jets is an important backe-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch ground to a number of standard model (SM) processes (production of a single top quark, tt, and Higgs boson as well as vector boson fusion and WW scattering) as well as to searches for physics beyond the SM, e.g. supersymmetry. Leptonic decay modes of the vector bosons are often used in the measurement of SM processes and searches for physics beyond the SM since they have a sufficiently high branching fraction and clean signatures that provide a strong rejection of backgrounds. Differential cross sections for the associated production of a Z boson with hadronic jets have been previously measured by the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb Collaborations in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 [1-4], 8 [5-7] and 13 [8] TeV, and by the CDF and D0 Collaborations in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV [9,10].",

The measurements from the two final states, with an electron-positron pair (electron channel) and with a muonantimuon pair (muon channel), are combined. The measurements are performed with data from the CMS detector recorded in 2015 at the LHC corresponding to 2.19 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. For convenience, Z/\u03b3 * is denoted as Z. In this paper a Z boson is defined as a pair of oppositely charged muons or electrons with invariant mass in the range 91 \u00b1 20 GeV. This range is chosen to have a good balance between the signal acceptance, the rejection of background processes, and the ratio of Z boson to \u03b3 * event yields. It is also consistent with previous measurements [4-6] and eases comparisons.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| = 5. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.444) to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps (1.566 < |\u03b7| < 3) [11]. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution is 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV, to be compared to about 40, 12, and 5% obtained when only the ECAL and HCAL calorimeters are used. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [12].",

The hadronic activity not included in the jets will lead to an imbalance that translates into p bal T and JZB values different from zero. It includes the activity in the forward region (|y| > 2.4), which is the dominant contribution according to simulation. Gluon radiation in the central region that is not clustered in a jet with p T > 30 GeV will also contribute to the imbalance. Hadronic activity not included in the jets will lead to a shift of the p bal T distribution peak to larger values. The JZB variable distinguishes between two configurations, one where transverse momentum due to the unaccounted hadronic activity is in the direction of the Z boson and another where it is in the opposite direction. Events in the first configuration that have a large imbalance will populate the positive tail of the JZB distribution, while those in the second configuration populate the negative tail.",

In the case of the NNLO and geneva samples the two scales are varied by the same factor, leading to only two combinations. For geneva, the uncertainty is symmetrised by using the maximum of the up and down uncertainties for both cases. The uncertainty from the resummation is also estimated and added in quadrature. It is estimated using six profile scales [34,35], as described in Ref. [26]. Uncertainties in PDF and \u03b1 S values are also estimated in the case of the FxFx-merged sample. The PDF uncertainty is estimated using the set of 100 replicas of the NNPDF 3.0 NLO PDF, and the uncertainty in the \u03b1 S value used in the ME calculation is estimated by varying it by \u00b10.001.

Electrons (muons) are considered isolated based on the scalar p T sum of the nearby PF candidates with a distance R = (\u0394\u03b7) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6) 2 < 0.3 (0.4). The scalar p T sum must be less than 15 (25)% of the electron (muon) transverse momentum. We also correct the simulation for differences from data in the trigger, and the lepton identification, reconstruction and isolation efficiencies. These corrections, which depend on the run conditions, are derived using data taken during the run period, and they typically amount to 1-2% for the reconstruction and identification efficiency and 3-5% for the trigger efficiency. Jets at the generator level are defined from the stable particles (c\u03c4 > 1 cm), neutrinos excluded, clustered with the anti-k T algorithm [44] using a radius parameter of 0.4. The jet four-momentum is obtained according to the Escheme [45] (vector sum of the four-momenta of the constituents). In the reconstructed data, the algorithm is applied to the PF candidates. The technique of charged-hadron subtraction [43] is used to reduce the pileup contribution by removing charged particles that originate from pileup vertices. The jet four-momentum is corrected for the difference observed in the simulation between jets built from PF candidates and generator-level particles. The jet mass and direction are kept constant for the corrections, which are functions of the jet \u03b7 and p T , as well as the energy density and jet area quantities defined in Refs. [46,47]. The latter are used in the correction of the energy offset introduced by the pileup interactions. Further jet energy corrections are applied for differences between data and simulation in the pileup in zero-bias events and in the p T balance in dijet, Z + jet, and \u03b3 + jet which is estimated from the data as explained in the text. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty. In the ratio plots, they include both the uncertainties from data and from simulation. The set of generators described in Sect. 5 has been used for the simulation Fig. 2 Reconstructed data, simulated signal, and background distributions of the transverse momentum balance between the Z boson and the sum of the jets with at least one jet (left) and three jets (right) for the electron (upper) and muon (lower) channels. The background distributions are obtained from the simulation, except for the tt contribution which is estimated from the data as explained in the text. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty. In the ratio plots, they include both the uncertainties from data and from simulation. The set of generators described in Sect. 5 has been used for the simulation Fig. 3 Reconstructed data, simulated signal, and background distributions of the JZB variable for the electron (left) and muon (right) channels. The background distributions are obtained from the simulation, except for the tt contribution which is estimated from the data as explained in the text. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty. In the ratio plots, they include both the uncertainties from data and from simulation. The set of generators described in Sect. 5 has been used for the simulation events. Since the p T balance in Z + jet events is one of the observables we are measuring in this paper, it is important to understand how it is used in the jet calibration. The balance is measured for events with two objects (jet, \u03b3 , or Z boson) back-to-back in the transverse plane (|\u0394\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0 | < 0.34) associated with a possible third object, a soft jet. The measurement is made for various values of \u03c1 = p soft jet T / p ref T , running from 0.1 to 0.3, and extrapolated to \u03c1 = 0. In the case the back-to-back objects are a jet and a boson, p ref T is defined as the transverse momentum of the boson, while in the case of two jets it is defined as the average of their transverse momenta. All jets down to p T = 5 or 10 GeV, including jets reconstructed in the forward calorimeter, are considered for the soft jet. The data-simulation adjustment is therefore done for ideal topologies with only two objects, whose transverse momenta must be balanced. The jet calibration procedure is detailed in the Ref. [48]. In this measurement, jets are further required to satisfy the loose identification criteria defined in Ref. [49]. Despite the vertex requirement used in the jet clustering some jets are reconstructed from pileup candidates; these jets are suppressed using the multivariate technique described in Ref. [50]. Jets with p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.4 are used in this analysis.",

We select events in the tt control sample using the same criteria as for the measurement, but requiring the two leptons to have different flavours. This requirement rejects the signal and provides a sample enriched in tt events. Each of the distributions that we are measuring is derived from this sample and compared with the simulation. This comparison produces a discrepancy for events with at least one jet that we correct by applying a correction factor C to the simulation depending on the event jet multiplicity. These factors, together with their uncertainties, are given in Table 2.",

The background contamination is below 1% for the inclusive cross section, and increases with the number of jets to close to 10% for a jet multiplicity of three and above due to tt production. Multijet and W events could pass the selection if one or two jets are misidentified as leptons. The number of multijet events is estimated from data using a control sample obtained by requiring two samesign same-flavour lepton candidates, whereas the number of W events is estimated from simulation. Both contributions are found to be negligible. Figure 2 shows the p bal T distribution separately for electron and muon channels. The tt background does not peak at the same p T balance as the signal, and has a broader spectrum. The JZB distribution is shown in Fig. 3. The tt background is asymmetric, making a larger contribution to the positive side of the distribution because transverse energy is carried away by neutrinos from W boson decays, leading to a reduction in the negative term of the JZB expression. Overall the agreement between data and simulation before the background subtraction is good and differences are within about 10%.",

The response matrix describes the migration probability between the particle-and reconstructed-level quantities, including the overall reconstruction efficiencies. It is computed using a Z + jets sample simulated with MG5_aMC interfaced with pythia8, using the FxFx merging scheme as described in Sect. 4. The optimal number of iterations is determined separately for each distribution by studying the fluctuations introduced by the unfolding with toy MC experiments generated at each step of the iteration.

            "text": "The measurements from the electron and muon channels are found to be consistent and are combined using a weighted average as described in Ref. [6]. For each bin of the measured differential cross sections, the results of each of the two measurements are weighted by the inverse of the squared total uncertainty. The covariance matrix of the combination, the diagonal elements of which are used to extract the measurement uncertainties, is computed assuming full correlation between the two channels for all the sources of uncertainty sources except the statistical uncertainties and those associated with lepton reconstruction and identification, which are taken to be uncorrelated. The integrated cross section is measured for different exclusive and inclusive multiplicities and the results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The results for the differential cross sections are shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and are compared to the predictions described in Sect. 4. For the two predictions obtained from MG5_aMC and pythia8 the number of partons included in the ME calculation and the order of the calculation is indicated by distinctive labels (\"\u22644j LO\" for up to four partons at LO and \"\u22642j NLO\" for up to two partons at NLO). The prediction of geneva is denoted as \"GE\". The label \"PY8\" indicates that pythia8 is used in these calculations for the parton showering and the hadronisation. The NNLO Z + 1 jet calculation is denoted as N jetti NNLO in the The measurement is compared with different predictions, which are described in the text. The ratio of each prediction to the measurement is shown together with the measurement statistical (black bars) and total (black hatched bands) uncertainties and the prediction (coloured bands) uncertainties. Different uncertainties were considered for the predictions: statistical (stat), ME calculation (theo), and PDF together with the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ). The complete set was computed for one of the predictions. These uncertainties were added together in quadrature (represented by the \u2295 sign in the legend) legends. The measured cross section values along with the uncertainties discussed in Sect. 9 are given in Tables 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. Figure 4 shows the measured cross section as a function of the exclusive (Table 3) and the inclusive (Table 4) jet multiplicities. Agreement between the measurement and the MG5_aMC prediction is observed. The cross section obtained from LO MG5_aMC tends to be lower than NLO MG5_aMC up to a jet multiplicity of 3. The total cross section for Z(\u2192 + \u2212 )+ \u2265 0 jet, m + \u2212 > 50 GeV computed at NNLO and used to normalise the cross section of the LO prediction is similar to the NLO cross section as seen in Table 1. The smaller cross section seen when requiring at least one jet is explained by a steeply falling p T spectrum of the leading jet in the LO prediction. The geneva prediction describes the measured cross section up to a jet multiplicity of 2, but fails to describe the data for higher jet multiplicities, where one or more jets arise from the parton shower. This effect is not seen in the NLO (LO) MG5_aMC predictions, which give a fair description of the data for multiplicities above three (four).",

The shape of the distribution in the region below 10 GeV is better described by geneva than by the other predictions, as shown by the flat ratio plot. This kinematic region is covered by events with extra hadronic activity in addition to the jet required by the event selection. The estimation of the uncertainty in the shape in this region shows that it is dominated by the statistical uncertainty, represented by error bars on the plot since the systematic uncertainties are negligible. In the intermediate region, geneva predicts a steeper rise for the distribution than the other two predictions and than the measurement. The highp T region, where geneva and NLO MG5_aMC are expected to have similar accuracy (NLO), is equally well described by the two. The LO predictions undershoot the measurement in this region despite the normalisation of the total Z+ \u2265 0 jet cross section to its NNLO value. The geneva prediction shows good agreement for the measured p T of the first jet, while it undershoots the data at low p T for the second jet.

The LO MG5_aMC calculation predicts fewer events than found in the data for the region H T < 400 GeV. For higher jet multiplicities both LO and NLO MG5_aMC are compatible with the measurement, although the contribution in the region H T < 400 GeV is smaller for LO than for NLO MG5_aMC. The contribution at lower values of H T is slightly overestimated, but the discrepancy is compatible with the theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The geneva generator predicts a steeper spectrum than measured. For jet multiplicities of at least one, we also compare with N jetti NNLO, and the level of agreement is similar to that found with NLO MG5_aMC.

The slopes of the distributions for the first two jet multiplicities predicted by LO MG5_aMC do not fully describe the data. This observation indicates   that the NLO correction is important for the description of hadronic activity beyond the jet acceptance used in this analysis, p T > 30 GeV and |y| > 2.4. An imbalance in the event, i.e. p bal T not equal to zero, requires two partons in the final state with one of the two out of the acceptance. Such events are described with NLO accuracy for the NLO MG5_aMC sample and LO accuracy for the two other samples. In the case of the geneva simulation, when at least two jets are required, as in the second plot of Fig. 12, the additional jet must come from parton showering and this leads to an underestimation of the cross section, as in the case of the jet multiplicity distribution.
