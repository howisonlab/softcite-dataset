The analyzed data correspond to up to 8.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. We set the most stringent limits at a hadron collider to date assuming two different relations between the anomalous coupling parameters \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 , \u03bb, and \u2206g Z 1 for a cutoff energy scale \u039b = 2 TeV. The combined 68% C.L. limits are \u22120.057 < \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 < 0.154, \u22120.015 < \u03bb < 0.028, and \u22120.008 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.054 for the LEP parameterization, and \u22120.007 < \u2206\u03ba < 0.081 and \u22120.017 < \u03bb < 0.028 for the equal couplings parameterization.

Unitarity violation can be controlled by parameterizing the ATGCs as dipole form factors with a cutoff energy scale, \u039b.

In \u2113\u03bdjj production the dominant background is due to the production of a vector boson (V = W, Z) in association with jets from light or heavy flavor parton production followed by the production of singe top quarks or top quark pairs. These backgrounds are modeled by MC simulation, while the multijet background is determined from data. In \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u2113 production the dominant Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u2113\u2113, ZZ and Z\u03b3 backgrounds are modeled with MC. Detailed information about the background modeling can be found elsewhere [21,22]. The SM W W + W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bdjj and W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u2113 events are generated with pythia [25] using CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [26]. pythia is a leading order (LO) generator, therefore we correct the event kinematics and the acceptance of \u2113\u03bdjj events for next-to-LO (NLO) and resummation effects. To derive this correction we use mc@nlo [27] with CTEQ6.1M PDFs interfaced to herwig [28] for parton showering and hadronization. Comparing pythia to mc@nlo kinematics at the generator level after final state radiation, we parameterize a two-dimensional correction matrix in the p T of the diboson system and that of the highest-p T boson, and use it to reweight the pythia \u2113\u03bdjj events. The event yields for the W W \u2192 \u2113\u03bdjj and W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bdjj production are normalized to the SM NLO cross sections of \u03c3(W W ) = 11.7 \u00b1 0.8 pb and \u03c3(W Z) = 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 pb calculated with mcfm [29] using MSTW2008 PDFs. The above procedure is designed to give NLO predictions at the detector level for the SM contributions to the diboson processes. The W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u2113 events are also generated using pythia with CTEQ6L1 PDFs and thus also need to be corrected as a function of diboson p T to match predictions from the NLO event generator powheg [30]. The event yields for W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u2113 production are normalized to the SM NLO cross section of \u03c3(W Z) = 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 pb calculated for the Z boson invariant mass range of 60 < M Z < 120 GeV with mcfm and MSTW2008 PDFs.",

            "text": "In the ATGC analysis of \u2113\u03bdjj final states, we consider two classes of systematic uncertainties: those related to the overall normalization and efficiencies of the various contributing physical processes, and uncertainties that, when propagated through the analysis, impact the shape of the dijet p T distribution. We determine the dependence of the dijet p T distribution on these uncertainties by varying each parameter by its uncertainty (\u00b11 standard deviation) and re-evaluating the shape of the dijet p T distribution. The uncertainties with the largest impact are those related to background cross sections (6.3 \u2212 20%), integrated luminosity (6.1%), the jet energy scale (3 \u2212 9%) and the jet energy resolution (1 \u2212 10%) although the analysis of the \u2113\u03bdjj final states is fully dominated by statistical uncertainty. In the analysis of \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u2113 final states the most important systematic uncertainties arise from the diboson p T modeling (0.1 \u2212 0.4%), the lepton/jet energy scale (0.2 \u2212 6.0%), and the mis-modeling of lepton/jet resolution (1%). However, the systematic uncertainties are negligible compared to statistical uncertainties. Similarly, the \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u03bd final states are mainly affected by statistical uncertainty while the systematic uncertainties arise from the background modeling (< 7%), integrated luminosity (6.1%), lepton identification and trigger efficiencies (< 3%). In the analysis of \u2113\u03bd\u03b3 final states systematic uncertainties due to integrated luminosity (6.1%), lepton and photon identification (1 \u2212 5%), background modeling (1 \u2212 10%) and theoretical predictions on the production cross sections (3 \u2212 6%) dominate the total uncertainty.",

The E \u03b3 T and lepton's p T distributions, and the p jj T distribution from 1.1 fb \u22121 analysis can be found elsewhere [14][15][16][17]. The individual contributions are fit to the data as the in the presence of ATGCs by minimizing the \u03c7 2 function with respect to Gaussian priors on each of the systematic uncertainties [33]. The fit is performed simultaneously on kinematic distributions corresponding to the different sub-channels and data epochs. The remaining p jj T distributions for the electron and muon channels from the 1.1 fb \u22121 W W +W Z \u2192 \u2113\u03bdjj analysis are fit separately and the \u03c7 2 values are summed with those obtained in the simultaneous fit. The effects of systematic uncertainties on separate samples and subchannels due to the same uncertainty are assumed to be 100% correlated but different uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated.",

The limits in both scenarios represent an improvement relative to previous results from the Tevatron [6,7,[14][15][16][17]. For the LEP parametrization, our combined measurement with 68% C.L. allowed intervals of \u03ba \u03b3 = 1.048 +0.106 \u22120.105 , \u03bb = 0.007 +0.021 \u22120.022 , and g Z 1 = 1.022 +0.032 \u22120.030 presented in this paper has similar sensitivity to the results from the individual LEP experiments [8][9][10][11]. The combined D0 limits are more stringent than those set by the ATLAS Collaboration for \u039b = 2 TeV [12]. The limits from the CMS Collaboration [13] are not directly comparable to our results due to a different assumption for \u039b value that affects a dipole form factor and thus, the sensitivity to ATGCs [34]. Nevertheless, the combined D0 limits on \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 , \u03bb and \u2206g Z 1 are more stringent than both ATLAS and CMS current limits for \u039b \u2192 \u221e. Using observed limits we extract measurements of the W boson magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. When assuming the LEP parameterization with g Z 1 = 1, we set the 68% C.L. intervals of \u00b5 W = 2.012 +0.035 \u22120.034 (e/2M W ) and q W = \u22120.995 +0.042 \u22120.043 (e/M 2 W ).
