Surprisingly enough, the magnitude of this bias is found to yield an underestimation of the integrated luminosity measured by the LEP experiments by about 0.1%, significantly larger than the reported experimental uncertainties.

The first phase (LEP1), at and around the Z pole, provided a wealth of measurements of unprecedented accuracy [1]. In particular, the measurement of the hadronic cross section at the Z peak, \u03c3 0 had , has been used to derive the number of light neutrino species N \u03bd from (1) where R 0 is the ratio of the hadronic-to-leptonic Z branching fractions; \u03b4 \u03c4 is a small O(m 2 \u03c4 /m 2 Z ) correction; and ( \u03bd\u03bd / ) SM is the ratio of the massless neutral-to-charged leptonic Z partial widths predicted by the Standard Model (SM).

This effect has been first realised in the context of the International Linear Collider (ILC) design study [8]. A detailed analysis of beam-induced effects on the luminosity measurement at the Future Circular Collider (FCC) has been recently carried out and is reported in Ref. [9], together with methods to measure and correct for them. In the context of that study, it has been realised that these effects were already significant at LEP. As shown below, they lead to a bias of the measured luminosity of the order of 0.1%, which is large compared to the uncertainties reported by the experiments. 3 Needless to say, beam-beam effects were already well-known at the time of LEP [10]. To our knowledge, however, this beam-induced bias of the luminosity measurement has not been taken into account by the LEP experiments.",

The Guinea-Pig algorithm groups particles from the incoming bunches into macro-particles, slices each beam longitudinally, and divides the transverse plane into a \"grid\" of cells. The macro-particles are initially distributed over the slices and the grid, and are tracked through the collision. The fields are computed at the grid points at each step of this tracking. Here, the dimensions of the grid are defined to contain the \u00b13\u03c3 z envelope of the beam in the longitudinal direction, and the \u00b13\u03c3 x and \u00b16\u03c3 y intervals in the transverse dimensions. The number of cells (slices) are such that the cell (slice) size, in both the x and y dimensions (along the z axis), amounts to about 10% of the transverse (longitudinal) bunch size at the interaction point. In the context of the studies reported in Ref. [8], the C++ version of Guinea-Pig was extended in order to track Bhabha events, provided by external generators, in the field of the colliding bunches. This version of Guinea-Pig is used here. An input Bhabha event is associated to one of the e + e \u2212 interactions, i.e., is assigned a spatial vertex and an interaction time according to their probability densities. The electron and positron that emerge from this Bhabha interaction are subsequently transported as they move forward: the final state e \u2212 (e + ) potentially crosses a significant part of the e + (e \u2212 ) bunch, or travels for some time in its vicinity and, thereby, feels a deflection force.",

This effect is larger than the experimental uncertainty of the luminosity measurement reported in Ref. [7] for 1994. To assess the effect of higher-order electroweak corrections (including initial-state and final-state radiation, ISR and FSR), a sample of about four million Bhabha events, produced with the BHLUMI 4.04 Monte-Carlo event generator [14], from which the LEP experiments determined their acceptance, was used to estimate a multiplicative \"k factor\" on the luminosity bias. Both ISR and FSR lead to softer electrons and positrons in the final state, which thus experience a stronger focusing. This effect tends to increase the luminosity bias by typically 5%. In addition, ISR causes a longitudinal boost of the final-state leptons, resulting in a nontrivial effect on the effective LumiCal acceptance and therefore on the luminosity bias, which gets reduced by typically 1.5%. Finally, FSR photons are usually emitted at a small angle with respect to the final state leptons, and smear their direction symmetrically at larger and smaller angles, yielding a second-order effect on average. A clustering algorithm is likely to merge the electron and the radiated photon into a single cluster, thereby compensating for this small effect. An accurate evaluation of the latter, which would probably require the BHLUMI events to be processed through a full simulation of the LumiCal and a cluster reconstruction algorithm to be run on the simulated energy deposits, is therefore not crucial.",

On the other hand, the most up-todate calculation of higher-order corrections and the most recent measurements of the Higgs boson and top quark masses yield a small change in ( \u03bd\u03bd / ) SM from 1.99125 \u00b1 0.00083 [1] to 1.99083 \u00b1 0.00025 [2].

The integrated luminosity at the peak has been found to be underestimated by about 0.1%, a bias larger than the uncertainty reported by the experiments in this period. When this bias is corrected for, the number of light neutrino species determined by the combined LEP experiments from the invisible decay width of the Z boson increases by 95% of its uncertainty. The corresponding long-standing 2\u03c3 deficit on N \u03bd is thereby reduced to about one standard deviation:",

Measurements of selected LEP operation parameters have been performed every 15 minutes between 1989 and 2000. These measurements were partially recorded in a private database that still exists, which opens the possibility of a time-dependent analysis.",
