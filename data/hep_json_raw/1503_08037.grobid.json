Three mutually exclusive searches are presented, each optimized for a different decay topology. They include a multijet search requiring one fully reconstructed top quark, a dijet search requiring one or two jets originating from b quarks, and a monojet search. No excesses above the standard model expectations are seen, and limits are set on top and bottom squark production in the context of simplified models of supersymmetry.",

            "text": "a Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV [6][7][8] at the CERN LHC has reinforced the acuteness of this problem. These shortcomings suggest that the SM is merely a low-energy approximation of a deeper, more complete theory. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] is a widely considered extension of the SM that introduces an additional symmetry of nature between fermions and bosons. A new supersymmetric particle (sparticle) is proposed for each SM particle, with the same mass and quantum numbers but with a spin that differs by a half-integer unit. For example, squarks are the SUSY partners of quarks. Supersymmetric models contain extended Higgs sectors. The SUSY partners of the Higgs bosons are higgsinos. Neutral (charged) higgsinos mix with the SUSY partners of the neutral (charged) electroweak gauge bosons to form neutralinos \u03c7 0 (charginos \u03c7 \u00b1 ). Divergent quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass due to virtual SM particles are cancelled by corresponding contributions from virtual sparticles [16][17][18][19], thus resolving the fine-tuning problem. The symmetry proposed by SUSY cannot be exact, as no sparticles have yet been observed. However, the stabilising features of SUSY can survive with a modest amount of fine tuning if sparticles are not much heavier than their SM counterparts. For third-generation particles in particular, the mass difference between a particle and its corresponding sparticle should not be too large, in order for SUSY to provide a so-called \"natural\" solution [20][21][22][23] to the fine-tuning problem. Thus the SUSY partners of top and bottom quarks, the top and bottom squarks t and b, respectively, might have masses below or around the TeV scale and be accessible at the LHC. In SUSY models with R-parity [24] conservation, top and bottom squarks can be pair produced, with each top or bottom squark initiating a decay chain in which the end products are SM particles and a stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In many SUSY scenarios the LSP is the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 , which is weakly interacting and will escape detection, leading to a distinctive experimental signature of large momentum imbalance in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis.",

Hence events containing a muon or electron with p T > 5 GeV are vetoed based on the spatial distribution of particles around the lepton. A directional isolation parameter Iso dir is defined by considering particles in a region of radius \u2206R centred on the lepton direction, where \u2206R is 0.2 for muons and 0.2 (0.3) for electrons with |\u03b7| \u2264 1.44 (>1.56). A sum is performed over the particle transverse momenta multiplied by the square of the angle in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane between the particle and the p T -weighted centroid of all particles contributing to the sum [53]. Leptons from heavy-quark decays usually are closer to hadronic activity in \u03b7-\u03c6 space than leptons from on-shell W or Z boson decays. The requirements on Iso dir have been chosen to retain high rejection efficiency, especially for high-p T leptons, and a small misidentification rate for leptons from b quark decays.

Very small backgrounds from processes such as diboson, ttZ, ttW, and single top quark are estimated from simulation.

For the tt background, the M T2 distribution peaks around the top quark mass and decreases relatively quickly for larger M T2 values. For the signal, the distribution peaks at higher values.

However, events containing a highp T jet from ISR can provide a transverse boost to the recoiling b b system, enabling such events to satisfy the trigger and selection conditions. Additional search regions, hereafter denoted \"ISR\" search regions, are therefore considered by modifying the baseline selection requirements to allow an additional third jet from ISR: exactly three jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are then required, where the two highest p T jets must have p T > 70 GeV and the highest p T jet is required not to be b-tagged using the CSV loose definition.

As in the nominal dijet case, events are rejected if they contain isolated leptons or tracks, or if H T < 250 GeV. An additional requirement is p non-b T > 250 GeV, where p non-b T is the modulus of the vector sum over the transverse momenta of all jets that are not b-tagged.

For this control sample, which is selected using an isolated muon trigger, the muon is required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1 to ensure a trigger efficiency near unity. To exclude Drell-Yan processes, an event is vetoed if it contains an additional muon candidate that in combination with the required muon forms a system having invariant mass within 25 GeV of the mass of the Z boson. To reject muons from decays-in-flight and from semileptonic decays within heavy-flavour jets, the selected muon must be separated by \u2206R > 0.3 from all jets. The remaining events are accepted and classified using the same criteria that define each of the nine search regions, except that a b-tag veto (using the loose CSV working point) is applied, to minimize the contribution of tt or single top quark processes. The muon p T is removed from the event to mimic the signature of neutrinos from decays of the Z boson. All kinematic variables are modified accordingly, where p miss,\u00b5 T is used. Selection thresholds for the resulting p miss,\u00b5 T , H T , and M T (j 2 , p miss,\u00b5 T ) variables are the same as those used to define the search regions. In the case of the doubly b-tagged ISR search region, the p non-b T requirement (which, in this case, is effectively a requirement that the leading jet p T be larger than 250 GeV) is common to both the search region and the control sample. The muon selection, in conjunction with the restrictions on p miss,\u00b5 T and M T , ensures that the contributions of QCD multijet events are negligible. The \u2206\u03c6 requirement thus has minimal impact and is not implemented for the control sample selection. The estimated number of Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background events is: , N b jets ) represents the number of events observed in data, in each control region. The number of simulated events in the control sample is corrected for differences between simulation and data in the muon isolation and identification efficiencies as a function of muon p T , muon \u03b7, and trigger efficiency.",

Systematic uncertainties are assigned based on the level of agreement: 2-13% for the N b jets = 1 search regions and 8-30% for the N b jets = 2 search regions, where the uncertainties are dominated by the statistical precision available. To determine a systematic uncertainty in the number of non-W(\u00b5\u03bd)+jets events in the single-muon control sample, the production cross sections of Drell-Yan, diboson, tt, and single-top simulation samples are varied up and down by 50%; less than 10% variation is observed for one or two b jets, across all search regions. The sensitivity of R MC SR/CR in both the W(\u00b5\u03bd)+jets and Z(\u00b5\u00b5)+jets enriched control samples to muon isolation and identification is also studied. Varying these muon criteria within their uncertainties, and taking the deviations from the central values in each search bin, systematic uncertainties of 3-10% for N b jets = 1 and 5-10% for N b jets = 2 are assigned for both the M CT and ISR search regions. Another source of systematic uncertainty in the ratio R MC SR/CR can arise from differences between data and simulation in the production of Z bosons in association with one or two b jets. The data are observed to agree with the simulation to better than about 5% for Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events having at least one b jet and covering M CT values up to 250 GeV; we thus apply a 5% systematic uncertainty for all M CT and ISR search regions. Other theoretical systematic uncertainties largely cancel in the ratio of cross sections but are nevertheless considered. Higher-order corrections from QCD are expected to be less than 5%, and the uncertainty from the choice of the PDFs is negligible as higher-order electroweak corrections are similar for W and Z boson production and largely cancel in the cross section ratios [78].",

The data and simulation samples as well as the control and search regions are all defined to be kinematically similar, so most of the uncertainties due to mismodelling of event kinematics or instrumental effects are expected to largely cancel. However, the relative tt and W+jets contribution depends on the b jet multiplicity, which can be different between a search region and its corresponding control region. The accuracies of the factors R MC SR/CR are tested in data using two independent single-muon triggered samples containing exactly one b jet (expected to contain roughly equal tt and W+jets contribution) and exactly two b jets (expected to have a dominant tt contribution). A related source of uncertainty arises from possible differences in the modelling of lepton isolation and the isolated track veto between data and simulation. To probe this effect, the numbers of events with exactly one muon are predicted starting from a control sample with an isolated track and no isolated muon or electron using a transfer factor derived from MC. The average weighted uncertainty of the two studies results in 4-20% differences in the predicted background in various search regions. Statistical uncertainties in the transfer factors, due to the finite size of simulation samples, result in 2-16% and 10-80% uncertainties in the predicted backgrounds, for search regions with one and two b jets, respectively. Uncertainties related to the efficiency of the CSV algorithm to identify b jets result in 2-20% uncertainties in the final background predictions. And finally, uncertainties in the background prediction due to the contributions of dibosons and other rare processes, taken from simulation with 50% uncertainty, are less than 2% across all search regions.

Finally, we study the decay of the bottom squark via the channel b \u2192 b \u03c7 0 1 for different bottom squark and LSP masses. The CL s method [86,87] is used to estimate the lower mass exclusion limits at 95% confidence level (CL) for third-generation squark pair production. Signal samples are produced as discussed in section 4, where the modelling of ISR within MadGraph has been re-weighted to account for observed differences between data and simulation [34], and a corresponding signal uncertainty assigned. Other sources of uncertainty arise from the jet energy scale, the PDFs [75,88], and the integrated luminosity [25]. Signal cross sections include re-summation of soft-gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [89][90][91][92][93]. Theoretical uncertainties are dominated by PDF uncertainties, and calculations are detailed in ref. [88].",

Exclusion lines are shown in red for the combined multijet t-tagged and dijet b-tagged searches, and in blue for the monojet search. The maximum lower limit on the top squark mass is expected to be about 620 GeV and is observed to be about 560 GeV, in the case of a massless LSP. In the region for which m t \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 > m W , the maximum lower limit on the LSP mass is expected to be just over 150 GeV for a top squark mass of 580 GeV, and is observed to be about 180 GeV for a top squark mass of 460 GeV. In the case of highly compressed spectra, when m t is close to m \u03c7 0 1 , the strip below the kinematically allowed diagonal line, m t = m \u03c7 0 1 , and above the blue solid line is excluded, roughly up to 250 GeV in the top squark and LSP mass. Figure 10 shows the same results as figure 9, except also considering a chargino \u03c7 \u00b1 1 intermediate in mass to the top squark and LSP. A 50% branching fraction to the chargino decay channel, t \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , is assumed; the other 50% of top squarks decay via t \u2192 t \u03c7 0 1 . In this case, both the dijet b-tagged and the multijet t-tagged analyses contribute to the expected and observed limits. The sensitivity of the dijet b-tagged analysis to this model derives from the near degeneracy of the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 1 (m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = 5 GeV). The decay products of the chargino result in large missing transverse momentum together with other particles that are too soft to be reconstructed as a hard jet.

The bottom row in figure 3 shows distributions of M 3-jet T versus M R-sys T for SM tt simulated events (left) and for simulated events from a typical signal (right). All events are required to satisfy the preselection requirements and to have p miss T > 200 GeV. For signal events, the p miss T requirement typically forces the two top quarks to lie in the hemisphere opposite to p miss T . This leads to larger values of M 3-jet T and M R-sys T due to the large azimuthal angle differences involved. In contrast, for SM tt events, p miss T typically lies close to one of the two top quarks, and thus either M 3-jet T or M R-sys T tends to have a smaller value. The resulting correlations can be used to further reduce the SM tt background. Based on simulation, a simple linear requirement (0.5M 3-jet T +M R-sys T ) \u2265 500 GeV is imposed [see the diagonal lines in figure 3 (bottom)]. This requirement is found to be more effective than simple restrictions on M 3-jet T and M R-sys T separately. Four exclusive search regions are selected, defined by 200 \u2264 p miss T \u2264 350 GeV and p miss T > 350 GeV with exactly one or at least two b-tagged jets. The N b jets \u2265 2 requirement increases the sensitivity for high-mass top squark production. We further define a \"baseline\" selection p miss T > 200 GeV and N b jets \u2265 1 that encompasses all exclusive regions. Yields for different processes in each of the search regions are shown in table 1.",
