The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Candidate ttH events are selected that contain either one or two electrons or muons from the tt decays and are categorised according to the number of jets. Multivariate techniques are employed to further classify the events and eventually discriminate between signal and background. The results are characterised by an observed ttH signal strength relative to the standard model cross section, \u00b5 = \u03c3/\u03c3 SM , under the assumption of a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. A combined fit of multivariate discriminant distributions in all categories results in an observed (expected) upper limit on \u00b5 of 1.5 (0.9) at 95% confidence level, and a best fit value of 0.72 \u00b1 0.24(stat) \u00b1 0.38(syst), corresponding to an observed (expected) signal significance of 1.6 (2.2) standard deviations above the background-only hypothesis.",

Decays into \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, and \u03c4 \u03c4 final states have been observed, and there is evidence for the direct decay of the particle to the bottom quark-antiquark (bb) final state [6][7][8][9][10]. The measured rates for various production and decay channels are consistent with the standard model (SM) expectations [11,12], and the hypothesis of a spin-0 particle is favoured over other hypotheses [13,14].",

            "text": "The increased centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV results in a ttH production cross section 3.9 times larger than at \u221a s = 8 TeV based on next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations; while the cross section for the most important background, tt production, is increased by a factor of 3.3 [31], resulting in a more favourable signal-to-background ratio. The CMS Collaboration has performed searches in the all-jets [32] and multilepton [33] JHEP03 (2019)026final states with 35.9 fb \u22121 of data, achieving evidence for ttH production with an observed (expected) significance of 3.2 (2.8) standard deviations in the latter case. Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration reported observed (expected) evidence for ttH production with a significance of 4.2 (3.8) standard deviations, based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 and combining several Higgs boson decay channels [34]; in the H \u2192 bb channel alone, an observed (expected) upper limit on \u00b5 of 2.0 (1.2) at 95% CL and a best fit value of \u00b5 = 0.84 +0.64 \u22120.61 were obtained [35]. In this paper, a search for ttH production in the H \u2192 bb final state is presented that has been performed using 35.9 fb \u22121 of data recorded with the CMS detector at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2016. In the SM, the top quark is expected to decay into a W boson and a b quark almost exclusively. Hence different tt decay modes can be identified according to the subsequent decays of the W bosons. The event selection is based on the decay topology of ttH events in which the Higgs boson decays into bb and the tt decay involves at least one lepton, resulting in either \u03bd qq bb (single-lepton) or + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd bb (dilepton) tt final states, where = e, \u00b5 arising either from the prompt decay of a W boson or from leptonic \u03c4 decays. Analysis methods established in Run 1 [27,29] have been significantly improved, and novel methods have been added. In particular, two multivariate techniques -namely boosted decision trees (BDTs) and the matrix element method (MEM) [36][37][38][39][40] -that utilise event information differently in order to discriminate signal from background events have been employed in combination. Since the two methods aim at separating signal from different background processes, their combined usage helps to obtain a better sensitivity. In addition, a new multivariate technique based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been employed to separate signal from background events. The best fit value of the signal strength modifier \u00b5 is obtained from a combined profile likelihood fit of the classifier output distributions to the data, correlating processes and their uncertainties where appropriate.",

Muons are detected in gas-ionisation chambers embedded in the steel magnetic flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

            "text": "For comparison with the observed distributions, the events in the simulated samples are normalised to the same integrated luminosity of the data sample, according to their predicted cross sections. These are taken from theoretical calculations at next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO, for V+jets production), approximate NNLO (single top quark tW channel [56]), and NLO (single top quark t-and s-channels [57,58], tt+V production [59], and diboson production [60]). The ttH cross section of 507 +35 \u221250 fb and Higgs boson branching fractions used in the analysis also correspond to NLO accuracy [16]. The tt simulated sample is normalised to the full NNLO calculation with resummation to next-to-next-toleading-logarithmic accuracy [61][62][63][64][65][66][67], assuming a top quark mass value of 172.5 GeV and using the NNPDF3.0 PDF set. This sample is further separated into the following processes based on the flavour of additional jets that do not originate from the top quark decays in the event: tt+bb, defined at generator level as the events in which two additional b jets are generated within the acceptance requirements (see section 4), each of which originates from JHEP03(2019)026 one or more B hadrons; tt+b, for which only one additional b jet within the acceptance originates from a single B hadron; tt+2b, which corresponds to events with two additional B hadrons that are close enough in direction to produce a single b jet; tt+cc, for which events have at least one additional c jet within the acceptance and no additional b jets; tt + light flavour jets (tt+lf), which corresponds to events that do not belong to any of the above processes. The tt+bb, tt+b, tt+2b, and tt+cc processes are collectively referred to as tt+hf in the following. This categorisation is important because the subsamples originate from different physics processes and have different systematic uncertainties.",

Excluding the contribution from the lepton candidate, the scalar p T sum of all particle candidates inside the cone consistent with arising from the chosen primary event vertex is calculated. The neutral component from pileup interactions is subtracted eventby-event, based on the average transverse energy deposited by neutral particles in the event in the case of electrons, and half the transverse momentum carried by charged particles identified to come from pileup vertices in the case of muons. A relative isolation discriminant I rel is defined as the ratio of this sum to the p T of the lepton candidate. Electron candidates are selected if they have values of I rel < 0.06, while muons are selected if they fulfil the requirement I rel < 0.15 in the single-lepton channel and I rel < 0.25 in the dilepton channel. In addition, electrons from identified photon conversions are rejected [73].

A discriminant value is chosen such that the probability of tagging jets originating from light-flavour quarks (u, d, or s) or gluons is about 1%, and the corresponding efficiency for tagging jets from b (c) quarks is \u224865% (10%). The shape of the CSVv2 discriminant distribution in simulation is corrected by scale factors to better describe the data. This correction is derived separately for light-flavour and b jets with a tag-and-probe approach. Control samples enriched in events with a Z boson and exactly two jets where a b jet veto is applied are used to obtain the correction for light-flavour jets. The correction for b jets is estimated using a sample enriched in tt events with no additional jets [68]. For c jets, the data-to-simulation scale factor is set to unity with an uncertainty twice the one of the correction for b jets. Events are required to have at least two (one) b-tagged jets in the single-lepton (dilepton) channels.",

The signal is extracted in a simultaneous template fit of the discriminant output obtained from the simulation to the data across all the categories, correlating processes and their uncertainties where appropriate. In this way, the different background composition in the different categories helps to constrain the uncertainties of the different processes and increases the overall sensitivity of the search. Several methods that classify events as signal-or background-like were explored to achieve optimal sensitivity: DNNs and BDTs, combined with a MEM. In the DNN approach, the jet multiplicity and the DNN classification output, described below, are used for the event categorisation (\"jet-process categories\"). In the BDT approach, events are divided into categories based on their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicity (\"jet-tag categories\"). The approach that provided the best expected sensitivity in each channel, evaluated on fits to simulated data, was chosen for obtaining the final result from data.

These uncertainties are found to be small, typically below 1-2%. Effects of the uncertainty in the distribution of the number of pileup interactions are evaluated by varying the total inelastic cross section used to predict the number of pileup interactions in the simulated events by \u00b14.6% from its nominal value [82]. The uncertainty due to the limited knowledge of the jet energy scale (resolution) is determined by variations of the energy scale (resolution) correction of all jets in the signal and background predictions by one standard deviation. In the case of the jet energy scale uncertainty, these variations are divided into 26 sources, which include uncertainties owing to the extrapolation between samples of different jet-flavour composition and the presence of pileup collisions in the derivation of the corrections [76]. The effect of each source is evaluated individually. The uncertainty of the CSVv2 b tagging scale factors is evaluated by applying alternative scale factors based on varying the following systematic effects [68] by one standard deviation, separately for the different jet flavours: the contamination of background processes in the control samples, the jet energy scale uncertaintywhich is correlated with the overall jet energy scale uncertainty -and the statistical uncertainty in the scale factor evaluation.

            "text": "tt+hf production [83][84][85][86] nor higher-order theoretical calculations can currently constrain the normalisation of these contributions to better than 35% accuracy [87,88]. The shape of the final discriminant distributions as well as important input variable distributions of the sum of the tt+bb, tt+2b, and tt+b processes obtained with the nominal tt simulation were compared to those obtained from a 4-flavour scheme sherpa (v.2.2.2) [89] tt+bb simulation combined with OpenLoops (v.1.3.1) [90]. The shapes agree within the statistical precision. Therefore, an additional 50% rate uncertainty is assigned to each of the tt+hf processes to account also for differences in the phase space with respect to ref. [86]. Moreover, the robustness of the fit model was verified using simulated toy data, which were sampled from the templates of the fit model. The background templates were modified in the following ways to sample the toy data: increasing the normalisation of the tt+bb background template by 30% in accordance with the results in ref. [86] or replacing the sum of the templates of the tt+bb, tt+2b, and tt+b processes obtained with the nominal tt simulation by those obtained from the 4-flavour scheme sherpa plus OpenLoops mentioned above. In each case, a fit of the nominal model to the toy data is performed as described in section 7, including the full set of systematic uncertainties. The injected signal is recovered within a few percent, well within the uncertainties assigned to these processes. The uncertainty arising from the missing higher-order terms in the simulation with powheg of the tt+jets process at the ME level is assessed by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the simulation up and down by factors of two with respect to the nominal values, using event weights obtained directly from the generator. At the PS level, the corresponding uncertainty is estimated by varying the parameters controlling the amount of initial-and final-state radiation independently by factors of 0.5 and 2 [91]. These sources of uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated. The uncertainty originating from the scheme used to match the ME level calculation to the PS simulation is derived by comparing the reference tt+jets simulation with two samples with varied hdamp parameter [54], which controls the ME and PS matching and effectively regulates the high-p T radiation. The effect on the final discriminators owing to uncertainties in the underlying event tune of the tt+jets event generator are estimated using simulations with varied parameters with respect to those used to derive the CUETP8M2T4 tune in the default setup. The event count in the additional samples required to estimate the modelling uncertainties was small and induced changes to the discriminant distributions comparable in size to the statistical fluctuations of the additional samples. For this reason, the uncertainties were estimated conservatively as the changes in the rates of the different tt subprocesses independently for different jet multiplicities. If the statistical uncertainty owing to the size of the simulated samples was larger than the rate change, the former was assigned as uncertainty. The derived rate uncertainties were then correlated between jet multiplicities to account for migration effects and are treated as uncorrelated among the tt subprocesses. Possible shape variations of the final discriminant distributions due to the PDF uncertainty have been estimated by evaluating the PDF replicas provided with the NNPDF set [50]. The impact of the mismodelling of the top quark p T spectrum in the tt simulation [92] was found to be negligible. The impact of statistical fluctuations in the signal and background prediction due to the limited number of simulated events is accounted for using the Barlow-Beeston approach described in refs. [93,94].",
