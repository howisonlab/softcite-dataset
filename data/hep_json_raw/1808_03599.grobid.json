The data analysed corresponds to 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV and was recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, pp \u2192 tbH \u00b1 , is explored in the mass range from m H \u00b1 = 200 to 2000 GeV using multi-jet final states with one or two electrons or muons. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and how likely these are to have originated from hadronisation of a bottom quark. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events. No significant excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross-section times branching ratio of a charged Higgs boson as a function of its mass, which range from 2.9 pb at m H \u00b1 = 200 GeV to 0.070 pb at m H \u00b1 = 2000 GeV. The results are interpreted in two benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.",

            "text": "The production mechanisms and decay modes of a charged Higgs boson 1 depend on its mass, m H + . This analysis searches for heavy charged Higgs bosons with m H + > m t + m b , where m t and m b are the masses of the top and bottom quarks, respectively. The dominant production mode is expected to be in association with a top quark and a bottom quark (tbH + ), as illustrated in figure 1. In the 2HDM, H + production and decay at tree level depend on its mass and two parameters: tan\u03b2 and \u03b1, which are the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets and the mixing angle between the CP-even Higgs bosons, respectively. The dominant decay mode for heavy charged Higgs bosons is H + \u2192 tb in a broad range of models [14,15]. In particular, this is the preferred decay mode in both the decoupling limit scenario and the alignment limit cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2248 0, where the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson of the extended Higgs sector has properties similar to those of the SM Higgs boson [7]. For lower m H + , the dominant decay mode is H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd. It is also predicted that this decay mode becomes more relevant as the value of tan\u03b2 increases, irrespective of m H + . Therefore, the H + \u2192 tb and H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays naturally complement each other in searches for charged Higgs bosons. Limits on charged Higgs boson production have been obtained by many experiments, such as the LEP experiments with upper limits on H + production in the mass range 40-100 GeV [16], and CDF and D\u00d8 at the Tevatron that set upper limits on the branching ratio B(t \u2192 bH + ) for 80 GeV < m H + < 150 GeV [17,18]. The CMS Collaboration has performed direct searches for heavy charged Higgs bosons in 8 TeV proton-proton (pp) collisions. By assuming the branching ratio B(H + \u2192 tb) = 1, an upper limit of 2.0-0.13 pb was obtained for the production cross-section \u03c3(pp \u2192 tbH + ) for 180 GeV < m H + < 600 GeV [19]. The ATLAS Collaboration has searched for similar heavy charged Higgs boson production in the H + \u2192 tb decay channel at 8 TeV, setting upper limits on the production cross-section times the H + \u2192 tb branching ratio of 6-0.2 pb for 200 GeV < m H + < 600 GeV [20]. Indirect constraints can be obtained from the measurement of flavour-physics observables sensitive to charged Higgs boson exchange. Such observables include the relative branching ratios of B or K meson decays, B meson mixing parameters, the ratio of the Z decay partial widths \u0393(Z \u2192 bb)/\u0393(Z \u2192 hadrons), as well as the measurements of b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays [21,22]. The relative branching ratio R(D ( * ) ) = B(B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u03bd)/B(B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03bd), where denotes e or \u00b5, are especially sensitive to contributions from new physics. Measurements from BaBar [23] exclude H + for all m H + and tan\u03b2 values in a Type-II 2HDM. However, more recent measurements from Belle [24][25][26] and LHCb [27] place a weaker constraint on the allowed range of m H + / tan\u03b2 values. A global fit combining the most recent flavour-physics results [22] sets a lower limit at 95% confidence level on the charged Higgs boson mass of m H + 600 GeV for tan\u03b2 > 1 and m H + 650 GeV for lower tan\u03b2 values, assuming a Type-II 2HDM.",

            "text": "This paper presents a search for H + production in the H + \u2192 tb decay mode using pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Events with one charged lepton ( = e, \u00b5) and jets in the final JHEP11(2018)085 state ( +jets final state) and events with two charged leptons and jets in the final state ( final state) are considered. Exclusive regions are defined according to the number of jets and those that are tagged as originating from the hadronisation of a b-quark. In order to separate the signal from the SM background, multivariate discriminants are employed in the regions where the signal contributions are expected to be largest. Limits on the H + \u2192 tb production cross-section are set by means of a simultaneous fit of binned distributions of multivariate discriminants in the signal-rich regions and inclusive event yields in the signaldepleted regions. The results are interpreted in two benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM): the m mod\u2212 h scenario [28] and the hMSSM [29]. Both scenarios exploit the MSSM in such a way that the light CP-even Higgs boson can be interpreted as the observed Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV. Limits on the value of tan\u03b2 are extracted as a function of the charged Higgs boson mass. Finally, the excluded range of m H + and tan\u03b2 values from the H + \u2192 tb and H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd [30] searches at \u221a s = 13 TeV are superimposed, providing a summary of the ATLAS sensitivity to H + through the two decay modes.",

The ID contains a high-granularity silicon pixel detector, including an insertable B-layer [32] added in 2014 as a new innermost layer, and a silicon microstrip tracker, providing precision tracking in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker providing tracking and electron identification information for |\u03b7| < 2.0. The EM sampling calorimeter uses lead as the absorber material and liquid argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.47) and endcap (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 3.20) regions. Hadron calorimetry is also based on 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 (pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle). Alternatively, the distance \u2206Ry \u2261 (\u2206y) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 is used, where y = 0.5 ln [(E + pz) / (E \u2212 pz)] is the rapidity of a particle of energy E and momentum component pz along the beam axis.",

The h damp parameter, which controls the transverse momentum p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, was set to 1.5 times the top quark mass [45]. Parton shower and hadronisation were modelled by Pythia 8.210 [46] with the A14 UE tune. The sample was normalised to the top++2.0 [47] theoretical cross-section of 832 +46 \u221251 pb, calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD including resummation of next-to-next-toleading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [48][49][50][51][52]. The generation of the tt sample was performed inclusively, with all possible flavours of additional jets produced. The decay of c-and b-hadrons was simulated with the EvtGen v1.2.0 [53] program. The tt + jets background is categorised according to the flavour of additional jets in the event, using JHEP11(2018)085 the same procedure as described in ref. [54]. The tt + additional heavy-flavour (HF) jets background is subdivided into the categories tt + \u22651b and tt + \u22651c, depending on whether the additional HF jets originate from hadrons containing b-or c-quarks. Particle jets were reconstructed from stable particles (mean lifetime \u03c4 > 3 \u00d7 10 \u221211 seconds) at generator level using the anti-k t algorithm [55] with a radius parameter of 0.4, and were required to have p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. If at least one particle-level jet in the event is matched (\u2206R < 0.3) to a b-hadron (not originating from a t-decay) with p T > 5 GeV, the event is categorised as tt + \u22651b. In the remaining events, if at least one jet is matched to a c-hadron (not originating from a W decay) but no b-hadron, the event is categorised as tt + \u22651c. Events with tt + jets that belong to neither the tt + \u22651b nor tt + \u22651c category are called tt + light events.",

            "text": "To model the irreducible tt + \u22651b background to the highest available precision, the tt + \u22651b events from the nominal Powheg+Pythia8 simulation are reweighted to an NLO prediction of ttbb including parton showering and hadronisation from Sherpa 2.1.1 [56,57] with OpenLoops [58]. This sample was generated using the 4FS PDF set CT10F4 [59]. The renormalisation scale (\u00b5 r ) for this sample was set to the [57,60], and the factorisation (\u00b5 f ) and resummation (\u00b5 q ) scales to H T /2 = 1 2 i=t,t,b,b E T,i . A first type of reweighting is performed in the tt + \u22651b subcategories, using a method similar to the one outlined in ref. [61]. The reweighting corrects the relative normalisation of the tt + \u22651b subcategories to match the predictions from Sherpa, while keeping the overall tt + \u22651b normalisation unchanged. After applying the first reweighting based on the relative normalisation of the tt + \u22651b subcategories, a second type of reweighting is derived and performed on several kinematic variables sequentially. First the p T of the tt system is reweighted, and secondly the p T of the top quarks. The final reweighting is performed depending on the type of tt + \u22651b events. If there is only one additional HF jet, the p T of that jet is used in the final reweighting. If there is more than one additional HF jet, first the \u2206R between the HF jets is reweighted and then the p T of the HF dijet system. A closure test is performed on each of the reweighted kinematic variables, showing a reasonable level of agreement between the reweighted Powheg+Pythia8 sample and the Sherpa sample.",

For muons, the lowest p T threshold was 20 (26) GeV in 2015 (2016), while for electrons, triggers with a p T threshold of 24 (26) GeV were used. Simulated events were also required to satisfy the trigger criteria.",

In the final state, the dominant source of non-prompt leptons is from misidentified jets as leptons arising from W +jets or +jets tt production. These backgrounds are estimated using data. For the +jets final state a matrix method [98] is employed. An event sample that is enriched in non-prompt leptons is selected by using looser isolation or identification requirements for the lepton. These events are then weighted according to the efficiencies for both the prompt and non-prompt leptons to pass the tighter default selection. These efficiencies are measured using data in dedicated CRs.

Uncertainties can either modify the normalisation of the signal and background processes, change the shape of the final distributions, or both. The experimental uncertainties were obtained from dedicated analyses detailed in the corresponding references. The uncertainties related to this analysis are described in this section. For a precise treatment, the uncertainties are split into several components as explained in the following. The exact number of components for each category is listed in table 2. The most important uncertainties are related to jet flavour tagging, background modelling, jet energy scale and resolution and the limited number of events in the simulation samples. The impact of all systematic uncertainties is listed in table 5 in section 8. The combined uncertainty in the integrated luminosity for the data collected in 2015 and 2016 is 2.1%, and it is applied as a normalisation uncertainty for all processes estimated using simulation.

The mis-tag rate for c-jets is also measured in tt events, identifying hadronic decays of W bosons including c-jets.

Systematic uncertainties affecting the correction factors are derived in the p T and \u03b7 bins used for extracting the correction factors. They are transformed into uncorrelated components using an eigenvector decomposition, taking into account the bin-to-bin correlations [92,93,103].

For these uncertainties, the tt + \u22651b is reweighted to different Sherpa predictions with modified scale parameters, in particular where the renormalisation scale is varied up and down by a factor of two, where the functional form of the resummation scale is changed to \u00b5 CMMPS and where a global scale choice \u00b5 q = \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = \u00b5 CMMPS is used. Two alternative PDF sets, MSTW2008NLO [84] and NNPDF2.3NLO [44], are used, and uncertainties in the underlying event and parton shower are estimated from samples with an alternative set of tuned parameters for the underlying event and an alternative shower -18 -JHEP11(2018)085 recoil scheme. Due to the absence of b-jets from multi-parton interactions and final-state gluon radiation in the ttbb prediction from Sherpa, a 50% uncertainty is assigned to the tt + b (MPI/FSR) category based on studies of different sets of UE tunes. An uncertainty due to the reweighting of the leading jet p T is determined by comparing a reweighted event sample with an event sample without reweighting. Because the reweighting changes the normalisation for jet p T > 400 GeV by 15%, an additional normalisation uncertainty of 15% is applied in this region. The reweighting factors are derived from the CR with exactly four jets and at least two b-tagged jets and applied to higher jet multiplicity bins. However, the effect of this extrapolation is expected to be small and is covered by the above uncertainties.",

The largest deviation from the SM hypothesis is observed at 300 GeV. Given that a negative\u03bc is observed under this mass hypothesis, the test statistic t 0 = \u22122 ln (L(0,\u03b8(0))/L(\u03bc,\u03b8)) is used to quantify the deviation of the fitted result from the SM expectation. A local p 0 value of 1.13% is obtained at 300 GeV, corresponding to the probability to obtain a deviation at least as large as the one observed in data provided that only SM processes are present. Figure 9 shows 95% CL exclusion limits set on tan\u03b2 for the m mod\u2212 h scenario of the MSSM [14,15,28] and the hMSSM [29,125,126]. Beyond tree level, the Higgs sector is affected by the choice of parameters in addition to Higgs boson masses and tan\u03b2. For the m mod\u2212 h benchmark scenario the top-squark mixing parameter is chosen such that the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, m h , is close to the measured mass of the Higgs boson that was discovered at the LHC. In the hMSSM scenario, instead of adjusting the parameters of soft supersymmetry breaking, the value of m h is used to predict the masses and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons.   [28]. Uncertainties in the predicted H + cross-sections or branching ratios are not considered.  In comparison with a previous search for t[b]H + production followed by H + \u2192 tb decays [20], more stringent limits on H + masses for particular models and parameter choices can be set. The analysis reach is increased and now also includes H + masses between 600 GeV and 2 TeV. The excluded region of parameter space for the modeldependent interpretation is extended significantly for low tan\u03b2 and an additional excluded region is added at high tan\u03b2.",

Due to correlations between the different sources of uncertainty, the total systematic uncertainty can be different from the sum in quadrature of the individual sources. The normalisation factors for both tt + \u22651b and tt + \u22651c are included in the statistical component.
