Almost 50 years have past since the first detection of neutrinos from solar fusion in the Homestake experiment [1], and more than a decade since the SNO experiment provided the final confirmation of their flavor-changing oscillations [2,3]. Both prize-winning measurements mark the beginning and the end of a long period in which solar neutrino physics was defined by the experimental and theoretical efforts to resolve the puzzle of the apparent solar neutrino deficit [4,5]. Over the decades, the field has evolved from the understanding of the dominant features of the signal towards the study of more intricate sub-leading effects. Today, the production rates and oscillation probabilities of the 7 Be and 8 B components in the solar neutrino spectrum are determined to the level of a few per cent [6,7], a precision inconceivable in the early days of the field [8].",

The motivation for their continuing observation program is twofold: With the basic MSW-LMA oscillations [13] established (sect. 3.3), particle physicist are now scrutinizing the data for deviations from this standard three-flavor scenario, searching for instance for signs of non-standard neutrino interactions [14,15] or mixing of active with ultra-light sterile neutrinos [16]. On the other hand, solar physics will profit from more precise flux data on all spectral components [17], especially regarding the neutrinos from the subdominant CNO fusion cycle for which currently only upper limits exist [18].",

In section 5, the essence of their observational results is reviewed, ordered by the components of the solar neutrino spectrum. Section 6 presents our current understanding of solar neutrino oscillation and stellar physics, as well as the open questions that remain and that could be answered by the present or up-coming generation of large-volume experiments. Finally, section 7 provides an overview of new ideas for solar neutrino detectors currently discussed within the community, highlighting their strengths and limitations with regard to specific topics.",

The resulting free mean path of photons is very low: Quanta originally created in the center of the Sun take several ten thousand years to arrive to the solar surface. The decreasing temperature towards the outer layers leads to a rise in the fraction of partially ionized atoms and thus to a further increase in opacity. From a radius of \u223c 0.7 R , convection thus replaces radiation as the most effective means of transporting energy outward.

To arrive at the current state of the Sun, solar modelling starts out at the very beginning of solar nuclear burning when the Sun entered the main sequence, and tracks the evolution of the star over time (e.g. the accumulation of helium in the solar core) to the present. Its current age of roughly 4.5 billion years is determined from the relative abundances of long-lived radioactive isotopes in solar-system meteors, most famously the strontium/rubidium clock that relies on the decay of the rubidium isotope 87 Rb (T 1/2 = 4.88\u202210 10 yrs) [25]. A variety of stellar evolution codes is available for this formidable task [26,27]: The current state of the art relies on one-dimensional models with \u223c 10 3 radial mesh points and time steps of no longer than 10 Myrs. Radial resolution is chosen higher in critical regions (e.g. the bottom of the convection zone), and also the duration of time steps is adjusted to the stellar evolution rate. For a given time step, the equations of stellar structure are solved for each radial mesh point, taking into account the equation of state, the local energy release by fusion, and radiative opacities. In addition, a set of simple boundary conditions has to be met that are given by mass continuity and the relations between surface temperature, area and luminosity prescribed by the Stefan-Boltzmann-law. Using an informed guess on the start parameters, a radially continuous solution for density, temperature and pressure is found by iterative methods that takes into account the various interdependences of the determining quantities. The resulting configuration is only a brief snap-shot of the stellar state variables. Following the slow burn-up of hydrogen in the core region, the central temperature of the Sun increases over the ages, which has to be taken into account by a sequence of subsequent sets of calculations.",

Solar modelling is a case of reverse engineering: Arriving at the present age of the Sun, the resulting stellar model has to fulfill a set of macroscopic parameters that we currently observe: Mostly mass, surface radius and surface luminosity. While these requirements are set a-posteriori, they can be regarded as input parameters as they are undisputed and strongly constrain the parameter space. Additional input is required on the microscopic level: Solar structure critically depends on the initial elemental abundances, especially of elements heavier than helium, a.k.a. metals, that have to be derived from observation. While quantities for refractory elements can be gained from the analysis of meteorites, the volatile metals (C, N, O, Ne, Ar) are determined from abundances measured by absorption lines in the photosphere [28]. Note that the surface composition today is supposed to correspond in good approximation to the initial quantities of hydrogen X ini , helium Y ini and metals Z ini . Changes are mainly induced in the core when elements undergo fusion. However, some minor diffusion of heavier elements towards the core is expected, and can be included in the evolution calculations [29]. The local energy output is calculated based on the framework of reactions underlying the thermonuclear fusion of protons to helium [19]. The dependence of the involved reaction crosssections on ambient temperature is one of the critical parameters when correlating the solar energy outputs to the emitted neutrino fluxes [30] (sect. 2.2). Further important parameters are the Rosseland mean opacities to radiative transport that depend on local density, temperature, elemental composition and ionization levels [17,31]. The spectrally averaged values are usually derived form tables such as OPAL [31,32], the contents in turn deriving from extensive calculations.",

Evidence of p-waves is found both by periodic variations of the total solar irradiance on the time scale of minutes and by oscillatory patterns in the Doppler-shifts of absorption lines observed from the solar photosphere. Within the solar body, the radial propagation of waves depends critically on the local parameters of the plasma. In particular, the depth to which p-waves can penetrate into the deeper layers of the Sun is a function of wave frequency, which leads in turn to the formation of standing waves and the occurrence of preferred ridges in wave power spectra that relate preferred oscillation frequencies to the observed horizontal wave numbers [34]. Information on the solar interior is mostly inferred by a direct modelling approach in which the eigenfrequencies and wave numbers are determined based on the SSM [34]. By varying the assumptions on the underlying parameters, the SSM output can be adjusted to match the observed helioseismic data. By this process, helioseismic observation can access quantities like the depth-dependent sound speed, solar differential rotation and the depth of the convective zone: At its bottom, the disappearance of radial motion causes a discontinuity for the propagation of p-waves that is clearly discernible in helioseismic measurements. Until recent years, the per-mill level agreement between the SSM predictions and results from helioseismology has been striking [35,36], considerately strengthening the trust in the correctness of the SSM despite the observed solar neutrino deficit.",

Over the last decade, a noteworthy discrepancy arose in measurements of the volatile-element abundances in the solar photosphere: A re-evaluation of the Fraunhofer absorption line spectrum resulted in lower abundance values for these elements [37]. Compared to earlier analyses [28], the recent effort relies on a fully three-dimensional modelling of radiation hydrodynamics and transport, thereby refining the description of the Doppler and collision broadening of the absorption lines [38]. As a consequence, model profiles provide now a substantially better fit to the observed line shapes. In many cases, this results in a lower line strength required compared to earlier analyses [38]. However, the reduced elemental abundances result in a substantial degradation of the formerly astonishing level of agreement between SSM predictions and the observables of helioseismology. Most striking is probably the substantially inflated level of (dis)agreement reached in the radial-dependent sound speed profile that is illustrated by figure 1. This tension can be somewhat relieved if the lower abundances are counterbalanced by increased elemental opacities [38,39]. While this dispute remains unresolved, the pragmatic solution currently adopted within the solar neutrino community is the use of two different sets of volatile element abundances (metallicities) when calculating the expected neutrino fluxes: The former standard solar com-position dubbed as the high-metallicity model (high-Z or GS98) described in [28], and the novel, lowmetallicity model (low-Z or AGSS09) derived from the new evaluation by [38].",

            "text": "pp-chain. The dominant hydrogen fusion process in the Sun is known as the proton-proton (or pp-) chain and was first proposed by Hans Bethe. As depicted in figure 2, the pp-chain starts out by the basic fusion of two protons ( 1 H + ) to a deuteron ( 2 H + ), releasing an \u03bd e of low energy, Q \u03b2 (pp) = 423 keV. Less frequently, a three-body interaction p + e \u2212 + p leads to the formation of a deuteron by electron capture, releasing a mono-energetic neutrino of 1.44 MeV (pep). In any case, the new-born deuteron quickly fuses with a proton to form 3 He in a strong interaction process. From here, three reactions paths are possible: Either the fusion of two 3 He nuclei (pp-I), the fusion of 3 He and 4 He (pp-II), or the capture of a further proton on 3 He leading to the direct formation of 4 He (pp-III). From point of view of solar neutrino detection, the pp-II branch is the most interesting. In this case, the newly formed 7 Be nucleus will capture either an electron to be converted to 7 Li and in the process release a mono-energetic \u03bd e of 862 keV ( 7 Be), or a proton to form 8 B, a short-lived (< 1 s) isotope undergoing \u03b2 + -decay and releasing a high-energy neutrino, Q \u03b2 ( 8 B) = 14.6 MeV [19]. In principle, the highest-energy neutrinos are expected from the direct fusion of 3 He + p. However, due to the low fusion rate the corresponding hep neutrinos are outside the reach of current-day detectors [19].",

Alternatively, 4 He is formed from protons in a system of several reaction cycles that are based on the elements carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (CNO) [24]. The general layout of the double-cycle is shown in figure 3. Note that the heavier elements (metals) involved serve only as catalysts for hydrogen fusion to helium and are themselves not consumed in the process. As a consequence, the production of 4 He involves also in the CNO case the emittance of two neutrinos per full cycle, that populate the solar neutrino spectrum most notably in the (1\u22122) MeV region. While the CNO cycle features prominently in heavier stars, the Sun as a relatively light star doesn't reach sufficiently high central temperatures (yet) to allow for a significant CNO contribution to the total energy budget. In fact, a steady reaction cycle is only maintained in the very center of the Sun and creates an energy output corresponding to only (1\u22122) % of the total energy budget. At larger radii, the CNO cycle stalls at the reaction 14 N(p, \u03b3) 15 O which forms the bottle neck of the whole cycle [20]. The experimental uncertainty on the corresponding reaction cross-section directly translates to the CNO reaction rate occurring in the Sun and thus to the expected ratio of pp to CNO neutrinos emitted [20,40]. 14   Reaction rates.

The S-factor S(E) is such reduced to reflect only the nuclear processes underlying the fusion reaction. Regarded individually, the rate at which these reactions occur in the Sun is extremely low. The typical live time of a free proton to undergo pp-fusion is of the order of 8 Gyrs. Therefore, the measurement of the relevant cross-sections and S-factors in laboratory environments is notoriously difficult. In the energy range of interest, i.e. the Gamow peak for which the product of the reactants' velocity distribution and the cross-section becomes maximal, the challenge posed to experimenters is to reach sufficiently high rates while maintaining low background conditions [41]. In fact, the cross-sections of reactions involving weak currents are in some cases too low for a direct measurement, e.g. for the basic pp fusion rate at \u223c 2 keV. In these circumstances, the S-factors are either extrapolated from higher energies, calculated based on weak interaction and nuclear theory, or using a combination of both [41].",

Given the outward-decreasing temperature profile, thermonuclear burning is restricted to the solar core, the radial extension depending on the specific reaction type ( fig. 5).

Neutrino detection relied on a radiochemical method, the signature of interactions provided by the conversion of a handful of the target chlorine-37 atoms into radioactive argon. Despite of the technical difficulties involved, the method proved viable and allowed for a fairly accurate (if low) measurement of solar 7 Be and 8 B neutrinos (sect. 4.1) [1]. As a result, Ray Davis was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2002 for \"pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos\". The deficit found in the measured compared to the expected solar neutrino rate triggered the solar neutrino problem [58,59] and in its wake a series of further experiments trying to reject or to corroborate these findings: On the one hand, the radiochemical method was further refined by choosing gallium as a target, allowing for a lower detection threshold that was now sensitive to the complete solar neutrino spectrum including pp-neutrinos (sect. 4.1.2). Moreover, first attempts at a spectroscopic measurement of the solar neutrino flux were made, with the aim to disentangle the underlying solar neutrino spectrum from the energy-dependent effects of neutrino oscillations or other non-standard processes.",

The setups of the radiochemical experiments did not permit to observe the electrons emitted in the detection reaction but were targeted on the recovery of the produced radioisotope, i.e. 37 Ar in the Homestake experiment. Upon start of a specific measurement run, the daughter isotope was slowly enriched due to neutrino-induced conversion. However, there is a maximum concentration of the daughter isotope to be reached as the redecay to the initial isotope will counteract the neutrino-induced production. When approaching the equilibrium of the two processes, the product isotope is chemically extracted from the neutrino target, the exact technique applied depending on the given experiment. Note that even for detectors featuring tens to hundreds of tons of the target isotope, the number of daughter nuclei produced is vanishingly small. Per single extraction, a mere handful of redecays has to be counted with high efficiency. The daughter nuclei are usually transferred to a gaseous state and mixed with the counting gas of a miniature proportional counter to detect the isotope's \u03b2 + -decay or electron capture (EC).",

A neutrino detector based on the reaction (22) on 37 Cl was first proposed by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1946 [60]. In the early 1950's, Raymond Davis began to work on this technique. After first tries to detect antineutrinos at a nuclear research reactor in Brookhaven [61], Davis turned to the Sun as a strong natural neutrino source. Starting from 1965, the detector was put up in the Homestake mine in Lead, South Dakota [1]. The experimental hall was located at 1478 m depth (4400 meters of water equivalent, mwe), providing sufficient shielding from cosmic rays to reduce the cosmogenic conversion of 37 Cl to 37 Ar to a level well below the expected signal rate. A stainless steel tank held a target volume of 378,000 liters (615 tons) of prechlorethylene (C 2 Cl 4 ). Taking into account the natural abundance of 37 Cl of 24.2 %, this corresponds to 2.1 \u2022 10 30 target nuclei contained by the tank. The energy threshold for the reaction to occur is 814 keV, limiting detection to solar 7 Be, CNO and 8 B neutrinos. As displayed in table 3, the detector is in fact mostly sensitive to the 8 B neutrino flux because of the steep energy dependence of the cross-section [1].",

During this time, Davis confirmed in a row of experimental tests that the collection efficiency for the 37 Ar produced inside the tank was indeed close to 100 % and the detection efficiency of the proportional counters correctly estimated [63]. The verification of the applicability of the experimental method dispersed the widely felt disbelief that had first greeted the unforeseen result.

As displayed in table 3, the event rate is thus expected to be dominated by the pp neutrino signal. Due to its fundamental position in the reaction network of the pp-chain the pp flux is closely linked to the well-known solar electromagnetic luminosity (sect. 6.2.2). Including this constraint, the SSM prediction for the expected pp-neutrino flux thus features only minimal uncertainties (\u00b10.6 %). A comparison of measured and predicted rates in a gallium experiment was therefore regarded as a substantially more reliable test from point of the SSM than the earlier chlorine measurement that was primarily sensitive to the much less certain 8 B neutrino flux. In the early 1990s, two experiments based on the new technique were launched: The GAL-Lium EXperiment (GALLEX, later GNO) [66,67] at the LNGS and the Soviet American Gallium Experiment (SAGE) at the Baksan underground laboratory [68]. While the basic measurement principle was still close to the Homestake experiment, the two new detectors deferred in many technical details. For brevity, we regard here only the GALLEX experiment to exemplify the technique.",

This result was in full agreement with the findings of the SAGE experiment (still operational at the time of writing) [68]. As in Homestake, the experiments were subject to a long row of calibration measurements to exclude a systematic bias of the results. Maybe most remarkably, this included several calibrations with high-intensity neutrino sources, that relied on the close positioning of 51Cr and 37 Ar sources in the immediate proximity of the detectors (e.g. [69]). The emitted neutrino flux was determined based on the source activities (overall on the order of 1 MCi) and compared to the measurements of additional 71 Ga conversions induced in the target, reaching an agreement between measurement and expectation on the level of (86 \u00b1 5) %. While this constitutes a 2.8\u03c3 deficit that is today discussed as possible evidence for disappearance oscillations from electron to eV-mass sterile neutrinos [70], it is by no means sufficient to explain the much larger deficit observed in solar neutrino data.",

The primary intention of this first generation of experiments was not the search for neutrinos but for nucleon decay. In particular, the proton decay p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3e + provides a distinct event signature in the 1 GeV range that can be easily identified in Cherenkov detectors. Solar neutrinos on the other hand can only be detected via the elastic scattering on electrons, providing a single recoil electron with energies not greater than \u223c15 MeV. So while only the high-energy end of the solar spectrum was above detection threshold, Kamiokande was the first experiment to demonstrate that the observed neutrino signal indeed originated from the Sun, relating the directional distribution of recoil electrons to its position in the sky (sect. 4.2.1).",

While the materials used in state-of-the-art neutrino detectors are screened and selected for radioactive contaminations and meticulously cleaned during construction and commissioning, the solid materials (metals, glass, etc.) cannot be purified to the level of the target liquid. An important concept to obtain a clean neutrino data sample is thus the definition of a fiducial volume (FV) for neutrino detection. During data analysis, only events featuring vertices reconstructed within the FV are regarded for analysis. Events at short distance from the target surface (typically 2\u22123 meters) are rejected (e.g. [6]), thereby removing the very short-ranged \u03b1-and \u03b2-activity but also a major part of the \u03b3-rays emitted by the external materials. Due to absorption, the \u03b3-flux decreases exponentially with the width of the self-shielding layer.",

Starting from the most abundant oxygen isotope 16 O , a selection of lighter isotopes with large proton-neutron asymmetries is produced, either by direct photo-nuclear interactions of the muon or by secondary processes in hadronic showers caused by the muons. The most important short-lived isotopes featuring high production crosssections as well as high beta-decay endpoints are the radioisotopes 12 B and 12 N with half-lives of \u223c10 ms, while 16 N with a half-life of 7 sec dominates the long-lived component [82].

Therefore, the vertex reconstruction relies on the differences in the absolute photon arrival times at the PMTs. The time resolution of the 20\"-PMTs is \u223c3 ns for single photons [77]. Throughout SK-II to IV, the reconstruction algorithm performs a maximum likelihood fit to the timing residuals of the Cherenkov signal as well as the dark noise background for each testing vertex [78].

This device is complemented by an artificial 16 N source that provides electrons emitted with random orientation and a visible energy spectrum peaking at 7 MeV. The short-lived isotope 16 N is produced by (n, p)reactions on 16 O , the neutrons provided by a DT-generator.

The experiment was conducted in three phases that mostly differed by the methods employed for the detection of the final-state neutrons from the (NC) reaction [87]: In phase I (1999\u22122001), the neutrino target contained only heavy water, and neutrons were identified by their delayed capture on another deuteron in the target medium. The capture releases a single \u03b3-ray of 6.25 MeV, that in turn produced a visible Cherenkov signal either by Compton scattering on an electron or by e + e \u2212 -pair production. In the later phase II (2001\u22122003), 2 tons of NaCl salt were added to the water. The isotope 35 Cl offers a much larger neutron capture cross-section than deuterons and emits upon capture a \u03b3-cascade of a total energy of 8.6 MeV. The resulting larger Cherenkov signal greatly enhanced the detection efficiency. In the final phase III (2004\u22122006), the salt was removed and 3 He proportional counters introduced into the main detector volume. These were arrayed in 36 strings consisting of 2 m long nickel tubes. Neutron capture on 3 He is highly efficient and easy to identify on an event-byevent basis, thereby further reducing the systematics for the overall measurement.",

Cowan chose LS as a target material for the famous Poltergeist experiment that was their first try for detection of antineutrinos from the Hanford research reactor and predecessor to the famous Savannah River experiment that finally gave conclusive evidence for the existence of the neutrino [89,90]. In the following decades, the technique matured to provide ever greater neutrino detection volumes. By now, LS detectors are at the forefront of low-energy neutrino experiments, the scientific program ranging from solar neutrinos over reactor and geo antineutrinos to the search for neutrino-less double-beta decay [11,12,91].",

Organic LS are usually composed of (at least) two hydrocarbon components [11,94]: The bulk of the volume is made up by an aromatic solvent, doped with low amounts (gram per liter) of another aromatic molecule, commonly referred to as fluorophore or, for brevity, fluor. When an ionizing particle traverses the medium, the delocalized \u03c0-bound electrons of the aromatic rings are brought into an excited state with an excitation energy of about 4\u22125 eV, corresponding to the UV range of the photon spectrum. By non-radiative transfer (e.g. by F\u00f6rster interactions), the excitations are passed on to the fluor molecules. The combination of materials is chosen to optimize the overlap of the absorption band of the fluor to the emission band of the solvent, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the excitation transfer. What is more, the fluor induces a large Stokes' shift and thus photons are emitted at considerably larger wavelengths, e.g. in the violet end of the visible spectrum 13 . As the transparency of the solvent improves substantially with wavelengths, the red-shifted scintillation photons thus effectively avoid self-absorption and can travel for macroscopic distances through the LS \u2212 an important precondition for the construction of very large detectors [11].",

As a consequence, detection thresholds are generally much lower than in water Cherenkov detectors, reaching down to the level of several 100 keV for KamLAND or even 50 keV in the singular case of Borexino. This renders LS an especially suitable medium for the detection of solar neutrinos, including the sub-MeV energy range [80]. Purification also is used to remove organic impurities from the solvent, greatly increasing the transparency of the liquid. In many experiments, LS purity is close to optimum, so that scintillation light transport in the blue regime is solely defined by the Rayleigh scattering off the solvent molecules.

Their introduction is by two primary ways: Both chains contain radon isotopes ( 222 Rn resp. 220 Rn) that are emanated from the rock walls of underground laboratories but also from detector materials like the PMT glass or cables. Once dissolved in the LS, the radon isotopes decay and their metallic daughter nuclei remain suspended in the liquid. The ions can as well be picked up directly from the inner surfaces of pipes and storage vessels if these have been contaminated with radon and its daughter nuclei, e.g. by contact with air. The same is true of the long-lived and abundant isotope 40 K. Prior cleaning of all surfaces coming into contact with the LS and the employment of nitrogen atmospheres during storage, filling and operation of the detectors are therefore mandatory. Fractional distillation (under reduced atmosphere) has proven as the probably most effective purification technique to remove these impurities from the LS and can be employed either before detector filling or in loop mode during operation [93,98].",

The underground laboratories are located adjacent to a highway tunnel crossing the Abruzzese mountains from Rome to the Adriatic coast. The corresponding rock overburden is \u223c1.5 km (or 3800 mwe) [11]. The primary purpose of the experiment was a measurement of the low-energy 7 Be neutrino flux by elastic electron scattering. As a consequence, the detector was designed to meet the requirements of this measurement: A high light yield to be able to discern the \u03bd-induced electron recoil shoulder (sect. 5.2.1), sufficient shielding from external \u03b3-rays and, most importantly, the purification of the target LS to a level of \u2264 1 background event per day and ton in the energy region of interest [7]. Detector layout. The basic layout of Borexino is presented in figure 12  [11]. The Inner Detector (ID) is confined by a spherical steel tank of 6.85 m radius. At its very center, the ID contains the neutrino target of 278 tons of ultrapure LS (see below). The target is surrounded by two concentric layers of inactive buffer liquids that provide shielding from external \u03b3-rays. The sub-volumes are separated by two ultra-thin (125 m) balloon-shaped nylon vessels [101]. The Inner Vessel (IV) of 4.25 m radius separates the target volume from the Inner Buffer, while a second balloon at 5.50 m prevents convective motion between inner and outer buffer and impedes radon diffusion towards the target. Both vessels are held in place (and shape) by a system of nylon ropes. The scintillation light from the target is detected by an array of 2212 8\" PMTs that are in their majority equipped with aluminum light concentrators (conical mirrors) to increase the light collection efficiency [102]. 371 PMTs are left without cones to assist the Cherenkov light collection and tagging of cosmic muons passing only the buffer region [11]. The ID is surrounded by a dome-shaped water tank of 18 m diameter. This Outer Detector (OD) contains 2.4 kt of water and is equipped with 208 PMTs. The OD provides a coincidence veto for through-going cosmic muons and assists the muon track reconstruction in the ID. The residual flux of muons at LNGS is only \u223c1.2 m \u22122 h \u22121 , corresponding to 4300 muons per day crossing the Inner Detector of Borexino [103].",

However, secular equilibrium was broken in several places along the 238 U decay chain. 210 Pb, 210 Bi and 210 Po levels proved to be comparable to or above the solar neutrino rates. In addition, 85 Kr was found to contribute sizably to the low energy spectrum [93].

Almost immediately, KamLAND discovered a deficit in the detected\u03bd e rate [107]. In the followup, the experiment performed a measurement of the oscillation parameters \u03b8 12 and especially \u2206m 2 21 , providing complementary information to the \u03bd e oscillation data from the solar neutrino experiments [49]. After an analysis of high-energy 8 B neutrinos (sect. 5.1.4) and an extensive purification campaign of the target LS, KamLAND performed a two-year measurement (2009-2011) of the solar 7 Be neutrino flux [98,108] that is described in section 5.2.2. In its most recent incarnation, the KamLAND-ZEN detector has loaded a sub-volume of the LS target with several 100 kg of the xenon-isotope 136 Xe, searching for the neutrino-less double-beta decay [91].

During its reactor antineutrino measurements and also later on in its solar phase, KamLAND has been using a three-component scintillator: The bulk material consists of a mixture of 20 volume percent pseudocumene (PC, as in Borexino) and 80 % Dodecane (C12), a normal paraffin featuring 12 carbon atoms. Although the addition of the C12 decreases the initial light yield by \u223c20 %, it greatly improves the transparency of the LS, accommodating the large detector diameter, and increases the hydrogen content of the LS that is important for \u03bd e detection via the inverse beta decay on protons.

However, the lowest energy data point at 3 MeV electron recoil energy is provided by Borexino (sect. 5.1.3). In 2011, KamLAND released a 8 B result compatible with all earlier measurements (sect. 5.1.4).",

The great novelty of the SNO measurement was the availability of three detection channels in heavy water sensitive to different neutrino flavors: Elastic scattering off electrons (ES) as well as charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) reactions on deuterons. The latter permit to distinguish the \u03bd e component in CC reactions from the total 8 B neutrino flux determined by the NC channel. In the following, the final analysis of the Phase-I data set is reviewed [86]. A combined low-threshold analyses [88] of Phase-I and II data is shortly discussed in sect. 5.1.3, while the final analysis of all three phases was published in [87].",

In addition, the orientation of the reconstructed Cherenkov cones is taken into account, rejecting events featuring inward-pointing tracks even at further distances from the PMTs as they are more likely to result from external \u03b3-rays. Moreover, the \u03b2(\u03b3)-decays of 208 Tl and 214 Bi dissolved in the water dominate the recoil spectrum at low energies. As described in section 4.  [82]. As the SK site is relatively shallow, the cosmic muon rate in the detector amounts to 2 s \u22121 . Therefore, A SNO-type veto of the whole detector for 20 seconds after each muon event is not practicable. Instead, additional information on the parent muon is exploited to assign a likelihood that a given high-energy electron event is of cosmogenic origin: Criteria used are the spatial distance to a potential parent muon track, the time elapsed since the passing of the muon and the muon's visible light output. An increased value marks the production of a hadronic shower inside the detector, corresponding to a larger probability that spallation isotopes were produced. Applying an event selection based on this likelihood removes a considerable fraction of cosmogenic background events while introducing only a \u223c20 % loss in exposure [77].",

A determination of the neutrino spectral shape must thus rely on a spectral de-convolution of the energy-dependent cross-section [109].",

            "text": "When accessing the low-energy regime E vis \u2248 T e \u2264 5 MeV, the radioactive contamination of the target material immediately plays a much more important role. Especially in water Cherenkov detectors low-energy background events from radioactive decays are smeared out to higher energies. Here, the low-threshold analyses of the SNO and SK experiments are shortly presented [6,88], followed by a more elaborate description of the corresponding analysis of Borexino that for now provides the lowest-energy data point [99]. data sets of phases I and II [88]. The starting point is provided by the analysis presented in section 5.1.1: The signal channels are extracted based on a simultaneous fit of energy, radius and direction profiles of the events. Moreover, a fourth variable is included that reflects the isotropy of photon hit positions on the spherical surface that is formed by the PMTs. This is especially valuable in the salt phase-II of the experiment, where the new variable allows to discriminate the asymmetric hit distributions resulting from the Cherenkov cones of CC and ES events from the more isotropic photon pattern resulting from the \u03b3-cascade caused by neutron capture on 35 Cl . Due to this additional handle, the spectral shapes of ES and CC channels can be partially unconstrained in the fit, providing sensitivity to the energy-dependence of P ee (E). Further improvements of the analysis encompassed the inclusion of new background components in the fit: internal ( 214 Bi and 208 Tl ) decays and external \u03b3-rays; the energy reconstruction was refined to reduce the spectral overlap of signal and internal background spectra; an external background veto similar to that of the SK analysis (sect. 5.1.2) as well as an energy-dependent fiducial volume cut were applied; and finally, runs known for high radon content in the heavy water target were removed from the data set. As a consequence, the overall analysis threshold could be reduced to a visible energy of 3.5 MeV. Furthermore, spectral shapes for both CC and ES channels were extracted from the data to determine P ee (E) from the comparison to the SSM prediction: The result for the ES spectrum that has been included in figure 16 is inconclusive, while the CC data shown in figure 17 show a moderate tension (\u223c 2\u03c3) with the SSM prediction for the two lowest-energy data points. Note that the CC spectrum is more sensitive to low-energy neutrinos in the vacuum-matter transition region because in this case the electron recoil energy T e is directly related to the neutrino energy E \u03bd via E \u03bd = T e + 1.44 MeV.",

This basic property persists even if an upward-fluctuation of photon hits caused by Poissonian statistics leads to a considerably larger visible energy. The new technique is successfully employed to discriminate \u03bd-induced electron recoils from 214 Bi \u03b2-decays. Based on the these improvements, an extraction of the directional forward-scattering peak of ES recoil electrons becomes possible even at energies as low as 3.5 MeV (sect. 5.1.2) [6].

Its liquid scintillator target provides two advantages compared to water: The substantially greater light yield provides a sizable and easy to detect signal even for the low-energy range of the 8 B spectrum, allowing for a better reconstruction of the event characteristics. Moreover, the neutrino target and surrounding buffer volumes feature substantially lower radioactive background levels. As a consequence, the Borexino 8 B analysis features the lowest energy threshold of only 3.0 MeV. On the other hand, an important disadvantage of Borexino is the relatively small target size of the detector: In [99], the spherical fiducial volume (FV) is defined by a radial cut at 3 m, leaving only the innermost 100 tons for neutrino analysis. The measurement accuracy is thus limited primarily by the comparatively low event statistics.",

The self-shielding by buffer and outer scintillator layers is not sufficient to reduce this background to a rate lower than the expected 8 B ES signal.

Following each muon identified, a 6.5-second veto of the full detection volume is applied, thereby removing \u03b3-ray background from captures of spallation neutrons on carbon (E \u03b3 \u223c 4.5 MeV) and the decays of a number of short-lived spallation isotopes (e.g. 12 B with Q \u03b2 = 13.4 MeV).

The analysis was based on a 4-year data set (2011\u22122015) from Borexino Phase-II in which the stability and signal-to-background ratio was significantly improved compared to Phase-I. The time bins of such a modulation analysis are of the order of 20 days and such too short to apply a spectral fit to extract the 7 Be rate. Instead, the analysis was performed on a \u03b2-like event sample selected by a fiducial volume and tight energy (215\u2212715 keV) cuts, subtracting 210 Po \u03b1-background based on an improved pulse shape discrimination using a Multi-Layer Perceptron machine learning algorithm and correcting for the residual background rate of 210 Bi \u03b2-decays included in the selected data. The presence of an annual modulation in the resulting rate data was validated by a sinusoidal fit ( fig. 21), based on the Lomb-Scargle method and the Empirical Mode Decomposition technique: The absence of an annual modulation is rejected with a confidence level of 99.99 %. The direct fit to the event rate returns a modulation amplitude corresponding to an eccentricity of (1.66 \u00b1 0.45) % of the terrestrial orbit. Moreover, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram features a clear spectral maximum at 1-year modulation period [115]. This finding is a direct confirmation of the solar origin of the observed 7 Be signal, comparable to the solar peak in the angular distribution of ES events in Water Cherenkov Detectors. ",

Above \u223c0.9 MeV, the ES spectrum is dominated by the \u03b2 + -decay of the cosmogenic isotope 11 C . While the maximum kinetic energy of the positron is only 961 keV, the combined signal of the kinetic energy and the annihilation of the e + in the scintillator results in a visible energy of (1\u22122) MeV, broadened further by energy smearing. The long 11 C live-time of 29.4 min forbids a simple timing veto following each potential parent muon \u2212 the average time difference between subsequent muons in Borexino is only 20 s. Instead, a sophisticated three-fold coincidence (TFC) veto had to be developed. The TFC is based on the production mechanism of 11 C from 12 C spallation that is accompanied by the emission of a neutron in 95 % of all cases. The veto relies not only on timing but also on a set of finely tuned spatial cuts that regard the distances of a possible 11 C event to both the parent muon track and the neutron capture vertex. Figure 23 depicts the data spectrum after applying the TFC veto. In this plot, the residual 11 C rate is to (2.5 \u00b1 0.3) per day and 100 t, corresponding to a reduction to (9 \u00b1 1) % of the original rate, while 48.5 % of the original exposure is preserved, bringing background and signal roughly on par [18].",

Rate determination is complicated by the fact that a relevant part of the 14 C decay spectrum is below trigger threshold. While an extrapolation of the complete 14 C rate from the detectable range is in principle possible, it will introduce a number of systematic uncertainties that are caused by the energydependence of the trigger efficiency and the corresponding distortion of the 14 C spectrum. To avoid these, 14 C rate and spectrum are determined in a parasitic measurement mode: Once the DAQ is triggered by a fast coincidence of 25 PMT hits or more, all hits following in the next 16 s will be acquired. Within this time gate, a sample of random events is provided that extends well below the trigger threshold. These secondary events are dominantly 14 C decays and thus provide an undistorted \u03b2-spectrum as well as an overall rate estimate.",

Especially this low-energy pile-up is very dangerous as its shape extends somewhat above the single 14 C spectrum and so mimics the slightly harder pp recoil spectrum. In order to obtain an effective spectral shape for these coincidences, the undistorted event spectrum from secondary triggers is used to create a high-statistics sample of 'synthetic' pile-up events. For those, the hit-time patterns of two random events are artificially combined, varying the degree of signal overlap by varying the relative start times. The rate and energy spectrum of this synthetic double events are both used as input for the spectral fit.",

            "text": "Mixing angle \u03b8 12 . The determination of the solar mixing angle \u03b8 12 is dominated by the precise measurements of the survival probability for high-energy 8 B neutrinos. As laid out in sect. 3.2, P m ee = sin 2 \u03b8 12 features little energy-dependence above 10 MeV. By comparing the ES and CC rate measurements of SNO as well as the ES result by SK to the NC result of SNO, a value of sin 2 \u03b8 12 = 0.310 \u00b1 0.014 is obtained [6], corresponding to \u03b8 12 = (33.8 \u00b1 0.9) \u2022 . Mass-squared difference \u2206m 2 21 . As the distance from the Sun to terrestrial detectors exceeds the neutrino oscillation length by far, a determination of \u2206m 2 21 via measuring the oscillation phases is impractical. Instead, the access to \u2206m 2 21 is somewhat more indirect: The positive sign, i.e. (m 2 ) 2 > (m 1 ) 2 , can be deduced directly from the mere presence of the matter resonance: The suppression of P m ee at 8 B energies compared to the vacuum value P vac ee would otherwise not occur. The numerical value of \u2206m 2 21 derived for solar neutrinos relies on two sources: It can be extracted from the energy dependence observed for P ee (E), the dominant information arising from the precise measurement of the 8 B neutrino spectrum. As described in section 5.1.3, all solar neutrino experiments find no deviation from the SSM-predicted shape down to the lowest accessible 8 B energies (\u223c3 MeV). This allows to set an upper limit on \u2206m 2 21 . On the other hand, a lower limit arises from the observation of vacuum oscillations for pp and 7 Be neutrino energies. The second constraint arises from the day-night asymmetry in the 8 B neutrino rate observed by Super-Kamiokande: The value of the day-night amplitude is strongly related to the realized value of \u2206m 2 21 . The recent result provided by SK, A( 8 B) SK = \u22120.033 \u00b1 0.010 (stat) \u00b1 0.005 (syst) , in fact drives the current best-fit value of \u2206m 2 21 = (4.8 \u00b1 0.6) \u2022 10 \u22125 eV 2 for solar data only [6]. On the other hand, the MSW-LMA predicts a vanishing day-night asymmetry for the 7 Be neutrino rates. In accordance, Borexino sets a tight limit of A( 7 Be) = 0.001\u00b10.012 (stat) \u00b10.007 (syst) and is able to rule out at high significance the LOW oscillation scenario (sect. 5.2.1) [114]. Globally, the most accurate value of \u2206m 2 21 = (7.49 +0.19 \u22120.18 ) \u2022 10 \u22125 eV 2 is obtained [6] when combining all solar data with the reactor\u03bd e results from KamLAND that provides P\u0113\u0113(E, L) at long (\u223c200 km) oscillation baselines [119]. Here, greater accuracy can be gained by a direct measurement of the oscillation frequency in eq. (11). Contrariwise, solar neutrinos provide better constraints on the mixing angle \u03b8 12 . Best-fit contours of both parameters, individually and combined for solar and KamLAND data, are displayed in figure 26 [6].  Figure 25: Combined results of all solar neutrino experiments (data points) on the energydependence of the electron-neutrino survival probability P ee (E) . The solid lines depict the predicted course of P ee for SK-IV best-fit oscillation parameters (green) and for solar+KamLAND parameters (blue). The 1\u03c3-band from the combined SK+SNO analysis is shown in red [6]. The right panel shows a zoom of the solar best fit region (green), the KamLAND reactor antineutrino constraints (blue) as well as the combined result (red).

The low accuracy on the solar measurement of \u2206m 2 21 when compared to the KamLAND reactor data [119] is mainly caused by the still relatively large uncertainty on the amplitude of the day-night asymmetry that is observed in the 8 B neutrino rate (sect. 3.3). The corresponding measurement accuracy in SK is still statistics-limited, so that a slow but steady improvement is expected by a continuation of the data taking. A corresponding measurement in the much larger Hyper-Kamiokande experiment would likely saturate the accuracy at the 0.5 % level implied by the systematics of the measurement (sect. 7.2) [120]. A further handle on \u2206m 2 21 is offered by a precise measurement of the energy-dependence of P ee (E) in the vacuum-matter transition region from \u223c1 to 5 MeV (neutrino energy): The best conceivable access points are the low-energy region of the 8 B neutrino spectrum below 5 MeV as well as the pep-neutrino line at 1.44 MeV [14,20,42]. While information on both is available (sects. 5.1.3+5.3), current experimental results still lack the precision necessary to challenge the KamLAND result on \u2206m 2 21 .

Applying the somewhat lower \u2206m 2 21 value obtained from reactor\u03bd e 's to predict the course of P ee (E), the spectrum of low-energy 8 B neutrinos is expected to feature an upturn towards larger survival probabilities in the 3\u22125 MeV range. Instead, the low-energy 8 B data acquired by SK, SNO and Borexino is more compatible with a constant value of P ee (E) = P m ee . Solar data prefers such either a lower value for \u2206m 2 21 or requires the presence of additional novel physics processes suppressing the upturn. For instance, the weak matter potential acting on \u03bd e 's when traversing solar matter might be larger than expected. As a consequence, neutrinos at lower energies would be affected and the upturn of P ee (E) shifted accordingly. Such an effect could for instance be caused by non-standard interactions of neutrinos with quarks or electrons. The magnitude of the effect required would have to increase the potential by about 60 % compared to the standard weak potential [14,15]. On the other hand, there might be an additional light sterile (!) neutrino eigenstate resulting in a new neutrino mass eigenstate m 4 located right in between the m 1 and m 2 masses. This allows for an additional resonance occurring for medium-energy \u03bd e , resulting in a suppression of P ee in the transition region [16].",

Often cited, the corresponding radial sound speed profile predicted by the SSM is showing much larger deviations from helioseismic measurements for this new low-Z model than for the former high-Z SSM ( fig. 1).

The elemental composition of the solar plasma affects the speed of sound mostly via its influence on the radial temperature profile: Larger metal abundances increase the opacity of solar matter for electromagnetic radiation and thus steepen the gradients of both temperature and sound speed. On the other hand, the SSM extrapolates the measured temperature of the solar photosphere to obtain a value for the solar core temperature T c . As the fusion rates of both pp and CNO chain are connected to T c by high power laws, the emitted neutrino fluxes basically act as precise thermometers ( fig. 4).

In fact, sufficient experimental accuracy is today merely reached in case of 7 Be and 8 B neutrinos. In order to perform a comparison between experimental rates and SSM predictions, the effect of neutrino flavor oscillations has to be taken into account. This is rather straight-forward in the case of 8 B neutrinos where the SNO NC measurement provides a flavor-independent result for the total flux. Contrariwise, the rate measurement of 7 Be neutrinos by Borexino is scaled for P ee using the fit value of \u03b8 12 , that is mostly determined by the SNO and SK measurements [39]. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the combined results shown in figure 27 is rather ambiguous: While experimental accuracy is roughly on par with the predicted flux difference, both 7 Be and 8 B flux results fall right into the middle ground between the predicted absolute values for low-Z and high-Z scenarios. What is more, the discrepancies in T c and thus neutrino flux predictions between low-Z and high-Z can be somewhat alleviated when changing the input values for elemental opacities \u03ba to the SSM [39].

            "text": "Potential of CNO neutrinos. A promising alternative test is in principle provided by a measurement of the CNO neutrino flux [39]: Due to the direct dependence of reaction rates on the abundance of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in the solar core, the predicted flux difference of \u226530 % is much more prominent than for the reactions of the pp-chain. The sensitivity to solar composition can be further enhanced by a combination of 8 B and CNO flux measurements that reduces underlying SSM uncertainties. As illustrated by figure 27, accurate experimental results might be used to discern not only low-Z and high-Z scenarios but provide also some sensitivity on the opacities \u03ba [39]. However, an accurate measurement of the CNO neutrino flux is experimentally challenging. In the range of currently running experiments, only Borexino provides sensitivity in the relevant spectral region. Unfortunately, the present best upper limit on the CNO flux by Borexino still fails to provide a meaningful constraint on the SSM metallicity ( fig. 27). Borexino's measurement accuracy is essentially limited by the internal radioactive background levels and event statistics (sec. 5.3): While the cosmogenic 11 C can be reduced to a sufficiently low level for a meaningful application of a spectral fit to extract the pep neutrino rate, the \u03b2 \u2212 decay spectrum of 210 Bi dissolved in the scintillator is quasi-degenerate with the CNO recoil spectrum ( fig. 19). While the purification campaigns performed before the beginning of Phase-II have brought down the 210 Bi rate, it is still considerably larger than the CNO signal. It is worthwhile to note that the real culprit is not the relatively short-lived 210 Bi (T 1/2 = 120 h) but the long-lived mother isotope 210 Pb (T 1/2 = 22.2 yrs) dissolved in the scintillator or attached to the inner surface of the nylon vessel. Due to the spectral degeneracy, a further reduction of the 210 Bi background (e.g. by a further purification campaign) will most likely only improve the upper limit on the CNO neutrino flux. A positive measurement of the signal requires to reduce the uncertainty on the 210 Bi decay rate present to a level substantially smaller than the expected CNO signal rate. Such a feat might be achieved by linking the 210 Bi rate to that of neighbouring isotopes in the uranium decay chain. Unfortunately, scintillator chemistry favors 210 Pb (the mother isotope) and 210 Po (the daughter isotope) over other isotopes in the decay chain so that secular equilibrium was broken during filling and re-purification. Moreover, the endpoint of the 210 Pb \u03b2 \u2212 decay spectrum, Q \u03b2 = 63.5 keV, is below detection threshold.",

However, the initial 210 Po decay rate in the scintillator after filling Borexino exceeded the 210 Bi rate by more than a factor 20, and was replenished during the 2011/12 purification campaign. Based on the 210 Po half-life of 138 days, several years of waiting time are required before secular equilibrium of 210 Po and 210 Bi is achieved. Moreover, it has become clear that convective motion within the scintillator may introduce new contaminants from the vessel surface into the detection volume, disturbing the equilibrium. To prevent convection, the Borexino collaboration has insulated the detector tank in early 2015, establishing a steep temperature gradient over the height of the detector featuring the lowest temperature at the bottom. It remains to be seen if the Borexino Phase-II measurement will be able to improve further on the upper limit of the CNO neutrino flux established during Phase-I or in the future might even be able to perform a positive detection.

The refurbishment of the detector as well as the installation of additional infrastructure is far progressed, so that the SNO+ detector is scheduled to come online during 2017. Provided its large target mass (900 kg) and extremely low-background levels (especially what regards shielding from cosmic muons), the experiment potentially has excellent prospects for a refined measurement of the CNO and pep neutrino fluxes. As in Borexino, the possibility for a positive CNO measurement will largely depend on the radioactive background levels achieved in the scintillator, especially what concerns 210 Bi (sect. 6.2.1). Nevertheless, the current priority of the physics program is on the loading of the scintillator with the \u03b2\u03b2-unstable tellurium isotope 130 Te, aiming at a timely experiment searching for the neutrino-less double-beta decay [126]. Unfortunately, the 2\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03b2-decay of 130 Te will dominate the solar neutrino ES signal in the energy range below \u223c2.5 MeV, covering most spectral components with the notable exception of 8 B neutrinos.

The high p.e. yield is expected to enhance as well the capability for pulse shape discrimination. Both factors favor solar neutrino detection. On the other hand, at a depth of 700 m the rock shielding provided is much lower than e.g. in Borexino, and also the required specifications for scintillator radiopurity are only on the level of 10 \u221215 to 10 \u221217 for U/Th. As a consequence, it is hard to tax the full potential of JUNO with regards to solar neutrinos: A high-precision measurement of the low-energy 8 B neutrino spectrum seems well within reach, utilizing both elastic scattering and a CC interaction on 13 C (sect. 7.4) [109]. Depending on intrinsic background levels, also a measurement of 7 Be or even pp neutrinos might be possible. On the other hand, preconditions for the detection of pep and CNO neutrinos will be less than ideal given the comparatively shallow depth [121].",

            "text": "LENA. A liquid-scintillator based observatory on the scale of SK and dedicated to Low-Energy Neutrino Astronomy (LENA) was first proposed in 2004 but not realized. The focus of the potential measurement program was primarily on the exploration of astrophysical neutrino sources, encompassing Supernova neutrinos (burst and diffuse), geoneutrinos, solar neutrinos and many more; a detailed description can be found in [130]. Far from nuclear reactors and at great depth (e.g. in the 1400 m deep Pyh\u00e4salmi mine in central Finland), the experiment was designed to optimize the conditions for rare event searches: The centerpiece were 50 kt of ultrapure organic liquid scintillator housed in a detector 100 m high and 38 m in diameter. Other than JUNO, scintillator and light detection properties were optimized not primarily to increase energy resolution but to enhance pulse shape discrimination of background events. Moreover, the great target volume would enable full exploitation of the self-shielding capabilities in LS: Restricting the analysis to the innermost 30 kt reduces external background to solar neutrino detection to a negligible level. Corresponding event rates range from \u223c 10 2 d \u22121 for 8 B to 10 4 d \u22121 for 7 Be neutrinos [109]. LENA would have the potential to address most of the open physics items laid out in section 6: The 8 B detection threshold was as low as 2 MeV, enabling a very sensitive test of P ee (E) in the transition region by both elastic scattering and 13 C CC reactions (sec. 7.4). The time stability of the 7 Be rate against periodic modulations could be tested on the 0.1 % level [131]. Finally, CNO and pep neutrino signals could be extracted at high accuracy even if internal background conditions were significantly inferior to Borexino. First studies indicate that 210 Bi levels two orders of magnitude higher than in Borexino would still allow for a few-% measurements of the CNO neutrino fluxes.",

As direct successor to SK, the next-generation detector aims to improve the experimental sensitivity to a variety of neutrino sources by a substantial increase of the detection volume. The currently proposed configuration of two underground tanks holding 260 kt of light water (187 kt fiducial volume) each, the target mass available for solar neutrino detection would amount to roughly 17 times that of SK. Moreover, the current design foresees a slight increase in light yield, improving both the detection threshold and background discrimination capabilities for low-energy neutrinos [120,132]. HK features a broad physics program that encompasses atmospheric neutrino measurements, the potential long-baseline oscillation experiment T 2 HK to determine the CP-violating phase in the neutrino mixing matrix as well as an intensified search for proton decay. While solar neutrino detection will still be restricted to the 8 B neutrinos, an important contribution to be expected is an even more precise measurement of the day-night asymmetry in the ES rate. Given the considerably larger event statistics, the sensitivity will be eventually determined by the systematic uncertainty of the measurement. Optimistically, this might reach the level of SK at \u223c0.5 % [120]. It should be noted, though, that background conditions might be less favorable in HK due to the shallower depth. A meaningful constraint on the value of the solar \u2206m 2 21 will be especially interesting if a non-standard course of P ee (E) is observed by other experiments in the vacuum-matter transition region (sect. 6.1). HK features as well a realistic chance for the first detection of hep neutrinos [120].",

Compared to both Borexino and SNO, solar neutrino detection in the JNE will profit from both larger target size and lower cosmogenic background levels, as well as the added benefits of Cherenkov directionality.

The 50-100kt WbLS experiment is proposed as a low-energy neutrino observatory located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in the Homestake mine [42,135,136]. The envisioned experimental program comprises three stages of changing detector configuration: In the initial phase, THEIA would serve as a far detector for the future LBNF beam from Fermilab to SURF. For this purpose, a thin WbLS mixture of relatively low scintillation light yield would be used, limiting solar neutrino detection to 8 B energies. In a second stage, the organic fraction of the WbLS would be increased (maybe even to 100 %), either in the total volume or in an inserted balloon holding several kilotons of target material. This second phase would allow for a full-fledged low-energy neutrino program, the possibilities for solar neutrino detection closely resembling JNE: The slightly lower rock-overburden would be balanced by significantly enhanced statistics due to the larger fiducial mass (cf. LENA). Moreover, a 1 % loading of the WbLS with the isotope 7 Li could be foreseen, leading to a substantial improvement in solar neutrino energy resolution (sect. 7.4). In a final third stage, the scintillator inside the balloon could be loaded with an isotope suitable for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay search. Utilizing recent technical developments in light detection, THEIA might be (partially) equipped with Large-Area Picosecond PhotoDetectors (LAPPDs). These novel MCP-based photosensors provide a time resolution of 50 picoseconds and thus offer a considerable potential for the discrimination of Cherenkov and scintillation components of the dual light signal even for fast scintillators with nanosecond-scale fluorescence constants [137]. Commercial production of LAPPDs has started in 2016, albeit in low quantity.  Figure 28: A measurement of the solar neutrino spectrum in the Jinping Neutrino Experiment has the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty on the energy-dependence of P ee : The solid line represents the SSM(low-Z)+MSW-LMA prediction for P ee as a function of the electron recoil energy, while the data points represent the measurement results expected for 2 kt fiducial mass, 1,500-day measuring time and 500 p.e./MeV. The statistical uncertainties shown correspond to the results of a spectral fit to signal and backgrounds but do not include systematic uncertainties on the overall normalization [134].",

The detection reaction for solar neutrinos, \u03bd e + 115 In \u2192 115 Sn * + e \u2212 , features a very low threshold of 115 keV, potentially allowing for a direct detection of pp-neutrinos. What is more, the reaction is followed by the decay of the excited tin nucleus to the ground state, featuring two low-energy gamma rays (116 keV, 497 keV) that provide a fast coincidence tag for the identification of neutrino-induced signals. Adversely for detection, 115 In in itself is \u03b2-unstable and decays with a half life of 6.4 \u2022 10 14 yrs to the ground state of 115 Sn (Q = 499 keV). As large quantities of indium are needed to allow for solar neutrino detection, this natural decay rate constitutes a sizable intrinsic background to detection that can only be overcome by optimizing the detector for identification of the neutrino-induced triple coincidence. The latest LENS proposal would foresee a highly segmented detector dividing the scintillator volumes into rectangular compartments, the separating walls acting as light guides that enhance the spatial resolution for event vertices ( fig. 30). This concept would provide the necessary discrimination power to discern three nearby e \u2212 /\u03b3 signals from the random coincidences of three independent 115 In decays distributed over the detection volume. A detector based on 10 tons of natural indium would result in an intrinsic background from 2.5 MBq caused by 115 In decays. Provided a sufficiently sophisticated background discrimination, CC reactions of solar neutrinos on 115 In would result in the prompt event energy spectrum depicted in figure 30: Clear signals are expected for the pp neutrinos, for which a 2.5 % measurement of the rate would require 5 years of exposure, and for 7 Be neutrinos. In principle, CNO neutrinos would as well induce an easy-to-separate signal. However, the detection rate would not be sufficient for an actual CNO rate measurement [138].

Based on their considerable success and progress in experimental technique, liquidnoble gas detectors on the ton-scale are now in their start-up phase, and target masses of 10 tons or more seem technically feasible. This opens up a new pathway to the detection of solar neutrinos via ES in noble liquids. While technically more demanding than water or organic scintillator detectors, the (still) smaller volumes and higher cost could potentially be offset by a number of advantageous detector properties for solar neutrino detection: substantially higher light yield, better background discrimination and maybe most importantly target materials like neon that feature no longlived radioactive isotopes.

Compared to organic scintillators, the expected light yield is considerably larger: for instance, liquid argon (LAr) releases about 40 000 photons per MeV. The gases are transparent to their own scintillation light, so that the photons will propagate to the verge of the detection volume. However, the emission spectrum is in the far or extreme UV and thus at too short wavelengths for conventional photosensors. Depending on the noble liquid, either PMTs with UV-transparent windows (liquid xenon, LXe) or coated with a thin layer of fluorescence molecules (LAr) are employed for light detection. In present-day small detectors, e.g. DarkSide-50 and MicroClean, photoelectron yields of 6 000\u22128 500 per MeV have been achieved for liquid argon, exceeding the value realized for Borexino by more than an order of magnitude [139].

Contrariwise, the closely related CLEAN project is directed towards solar neutrino detection [141]. The detector concept pursued is based on a spheric target volume containing 300 t of liquid neon (LNe). With a density of 1.2 g/l, LNe offers better self-shielding properties than water or organic scintillator. Neon can be effectively cleaned from radioactive contaminants by purification in cryogenic traps. Most noteworthy, neon features \u2212 other than argon, xenon and notably carbon \u2212 no long-lived radioactive isotope. Therefore, the combination of self-shielding and intrinsic radiopurity allows for virtually background-free measurements of neutrinos in the sub-MeV range.

Relatively small-scale detectors optimized for dark matter search, e.g. the dual-phase DarkSide experiment at LNGS [142], feature detection thresholds sufficiently low for the detection of recoil electrons from ES of solar neutrinos. Unlike neon, atmospheric argon contains a non-negligible amount of the radioactive \u03b2-emitter 39 Ar . Its decay rate defines a lower detection threshold of 0.57 MeV. This intrinsic background is thus likely to prevent any attempts on the detection of pp-neutrinos, while the feasibility to detect the Compton edge of 7 Be neutrinos at 662 keV depends on the energy resolution achieved. A further potential background, cosmogenic 42 Ar, can be avoided by using argon extracted from underground reservoirs [139]. Figure 31 depicts the electron recoil spectrum above the 39 Ar endpoint: The most important contributions of background arise from cosmogenic activation of argon, other radioactive noble gases ( 85 Kr and 222 Rn) dissolved in the LAr and external \u03b3-rays from materials of the detector periphery. Compared to LS detectors, a two-phase LAr TPC features an important advantage for the latter contribution: The spatial resolution of the drift signal is sufficient to discriminate a multi-site \u03b3-quantum that scatters several times inside the target volume from the single vertex of a neutrino interaction. Most likely, the sensitivity to solar neutrinos will depend primarily on the level of 222 Rn and its decay daughters in the detection volume, which in turn depends on the effectivity of argon purification by charcoal filters or similar techniques [139]. Unfortunately, none of the currently running LAr TPCs features a sufficiently large target volume for solar neutrino detection: Even the upcoming DarkSide-20k experiment based on 20 tons of LAr is likely too small. In [139], a dual-phase LAr TPC dedicated to solar neutrino detection has been proposed, featuring a target mass of 400 t and operated at the LNGS: The expected background levels are discussed in detail, the corresponding visible energy spectrum is shown in figure 31. Depending on the internal radioactivity levels achieved, the authors predict a measurement of the 7 Be elastic scattering rate at the \u223c2 % level, \u223c10 % in the case of pep and \u223c15 % for CNO neutrinos. Therefore, the sensitivity compared to an organic LS detector of the same target mass (Borexino) would be substantially improved.",

            "text": "High-threshold TPCs. A second detector category aims on the instrumentation of 0.1\u221210 kt of LAr for the detection of GeV neutrinos in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Prominent examples of running experiments are ICARUS at LNGS (soon Fermilab) and Mi-croBooNE at Fermilab [143,144]. Given the considerably larger volume and reduced instrumentation density, the detection threshold is in fact above solar neutrino energies. This concerns especially the light collection for the prompt scintillation signal that is not needed when the detector is operated in coincidence with a pulsed neutrino beam but a necessity for the observation of solar neutrinos. Similar to the aforementioned experiments, the future DUNE detectors at SURF will primarily aim at the detection of neutrinos from the LBNF beam. However, the DUNE physics scope envisages as well a low-energy neutrino program, including the detection of Supernova neutrinos at 10-MeV energies [145]. Up to four 10-kt LAr TPCs will be placed at a depths of 1450 m, the large rock overburden and hence low cosmogenic background levels offering favorable conditions for solar neutrino detection. Solar neutrino sensitivity will lastly depend on the instrumental detection threshold and the intrinsic radioactivity levels realized, as well as the capabilities for the reconstruction of the light and drift signals at low energies. Provided the energy threshold is in the range of a few MeV, a high-statistics measurement of the high-energy part of the 8 B neutrino spectrum seems well feasible. What is more, the most abundant isotope 40 Ar features a nuclear cross-section for \u03bd e CC detection, albeit with a relatively high energy threshold of 4.4 MeV. Provided the very large target mass envisioned, this CC channel bears the potential for a clean measurement of the 8 B spectrum and day-night asymmetry [145].   Figure 32: Electron energy spectrum in a large liquid-xenon TPC. The solar neutrino signal is covered by the 2\u03bd2\u03b2-decay of 136 Xe for all but the lowest energies. Nevertheless, a detection of pp-neutrino scattering events will be possible in the energy window from 2 to 30 keV [146].",

In both respects, LXe detectors have proven very successful and are currently at the forefront of their respective fields [147,148]. While target masses of today's experiments are still on the scale of several hundred kilograms, the XENON1T experiment has recently started to operate at the LNGS, featuring a detection/fiducial volume of 1 ton for DM interactions [149]. Preparations for the next generation of such experiments (LZ and XENONnT) featuring target volumes of \u223c5 tons have already begun and will most likely be in operation by 2020 [150]. With the DARWIN detector, an even larger project on the scale of 20 tons is being discussed [151]. While the primary motivation of these projects is the direct search for DM, they offer as well a low-background environment for solar neutrino detection. LXe features excellent selfshielding capabilities due to the high density of 3.1 g/l. Moreover, DM search requires excellent internal purity with regards to 85 Kr and 222 Rn , setting a standard sufficient for solar neutrino detection. As illustrated by figure 32, the main difficulty arises from the presence of the \u03b2\u03b2isotope 136 Xe intrinsic to the target material that will dominate the solar neutrino signal at all but the lowest electron recoil energies [146].",

However, a precise measurement of the \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e survival probability P ee in the thinly populated intermediate region of the neutrino spectrum still poses an experimental challenge. The comparison of future, more precise results on P ee (E) from low-energy 8 B and pep neutrinos and the amplitude of the 8 B day-night asymmetry with the\u03bd e \u2192\u03bd e data collected by KamLAND will provide a precision test of the standard MSW-LMA scenario and excellent sensitivity to new neutrino or weak-interaction related phenomena.",

The basic structure of KamLAND very much resembles the Borexino detector (fig. 13)[12]: A stainless steel sphere of 18 m diameter separates the inner LS detector (ID) from a surrounding water-Cherenkov veto. The neutrino target consists of 1 kt of LS (see below), confined by a 135 \u00b5m thin spherical balloon of 13 m diameter, made from several layers of nylon and EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol). The target is floating in an inactive buffer liquid, held in place by Kevlar ropes. The scintillation light is detected by 1879 20\"-PMTs mounted to the inside of the steel sphere. For about 2/3 of the PMTs, the photo cathode is masked down to 17\" diameter to improve timing and single photo-electron resolution. The outer tank holds 3.2 kt of water and is equipped with PMTs to provide a muon anti-coincidence veto for the ID. The muon rate traversing the ID is \u223c0.2 s \u22121 . Due to the lower rock shielding at Kamioka compared to the LNGS, cosmogenic background rates in KamLAND are on average a factor 3\u22124 higher than in Borexino (sect. 4.3.2)[12].",
