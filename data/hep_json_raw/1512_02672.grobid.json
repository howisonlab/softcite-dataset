We measure B(B \u2192 \u03c7c1X)= (3.03 \u00b1 0.05(stat) \u00b1 0.24(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and B(B \u2192 \u03c7c2X)= (0.70 \u00b1 0.06(stat) \u00b1 0.10(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . For the first time, \u03c7c2 production in exclusive B decays in the modes B 0 \u2192 \u03c7c2\u03c0 \u2212 K + and B + \u2192 \u03c7c2\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + has been observed, along with first evidence for the B + \u2192 \u03c7c2\u03c0 + K 0 S decay mode. For \u03c7c1 production, we report the first observation in the B + \u2192 \u03c7c1\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + , B 0 \u2192 \u03c7c1\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S and B 0 \u2192 \u03c7c1\u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u2212 K + decay modes. Using these decay modes, we observe a difference in the production mechanism of \u03c7c2 in comparison to \u03c7c1 in B decays. In addition, we report searches for X(3872) and \u03c7c1(2P ) in the B + \u2192 (\u03c7c1\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K + decay mode. The reported results use 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB events collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. ",

            "text": "Belle reported the first observation of \u03c7 c2 production in B meson decays with an inclusive measurement [1]. The \u03c7 cJ (J = 1, 2) [2] momentum distributions in the \u03a5(4S) rest frame (CM frame) indicate that most of the \u03c7 c2 mesons come from non-two-body B decays [1,3]. Still, there have been only a few searches for exclusive B decays with a \u03c7 c2 in the final state, B + \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K + [4] and B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K * (892) 0 [5][6][7]. The B + \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K ( * ) decays are found to be highly suppressed with respect to the similar \u03c7 c1 processes [8]. The suppression can be explained in the framework of the factorization in twobody B decays [9], where \u03c7 c2 production is allowed only when one takes into account final state interactions. Due to angular momentum conservation, J P C = 0 \u2212+ , 1 \u2212\u2212 and 1 ++ are favored while 0 ++ , 2 ++ , 2 \u2212\u2212 and so on are suppressed.",

            "text": "A study of the multi-body B decay modes with \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 in the final state is important to understand the detailed dynamics of B meson decays. Further, one can search for charmonium/charmonium-like exotic states in one of the intermediate final states such as \u03c7 cJ \u03c0 and \u03c7 cJ \u03c0\u03c0. For example, looking at the \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass spectrum in B \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K decays, one can search for \u03c7 c1 (2P ) and/or X(3872). The quantum numbers of the narrow exotic resonance X(3872) have been determined to be J P C = 1 ++ [10][11][12]. One plausible interpretation is an admixture of a D 0D * 0 molecule and a conventional charmonium with the same J P C , the yetunseen \u03c7 c1 (2P ) [13]. The \u03c7 c1 (2P ) component may have a substantial decay rate to \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 because of no obvious conflict in quantum numbers and observations of di-pion transitions between \u03c7 bJ states in the bottomonium system. In case that X(3872) is not a mixed state and hence \u03c7 c1 (2P ) is a physically observable state, its decay to \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 would still be expected. Its mass is predicted to be about 3920 MeV/c 2 , assuming that it lies between \u03c7 c2 (2P ) and the X(3915) that is interpreted as \u03c7 c0 (2P ) by PDG [8].",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle spectrometer, which includes a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), timeof-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprised of 8736 CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [14]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A first sample of 152 \u00d7 10 6 BB events was collected with a 2.0 cm radius beam-pipe and a 3-layer SVD, while the remaining 620 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs were collected with a 1.5 cm radius beam pipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and modified CDC (the cathode part of the CDC replaced by a compact small cell-type drift chamber) [16].",

            "text": "We measured the feed-down-contaminated B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c1 X) and B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c2 X) of (3.33 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and (0.98 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , respectively, where the first (second) error is statistical (systematic). After subtracting the \u03c8 \u2032 feed-down contributions, we find the pure inclusive branching fractions B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c1 X) and B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c2 X) of (3.03 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and (0.70\u00b10.06\u00b10.10)\u00d710 \u22123 , respectively. Here, the systematic uncertainty dominates. For inclusive production of \u03c7 cJ , we measure the ratio B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c2 X)/B(B \u2192 \u03c7 c1 X) of (23.1 \u00b1 2.0 \u00b1 2.1)%. We observe the B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c2 \u03c0 \u2212 K + decay mode for the first time, with 206 \u00b1 25 signal events and a significance of 8.7\u03c3, along with evidence for the B + \u2192 \u03c7 c2 \u03c0 + K 0 S decay mode, with 76\u00b115 signal events and a significance of 4.6\u03c3. In four-body decays, we observe the B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + , B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + , B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S , and B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u2212 K + decay modes for the first time and report on measurements of their branching fractions. We find that \u03c7 c2 production, in contrast with \u03c7 c1 , increases with a higher number of multi-body B decays: R B for B + \u2192 \u03c7 cJ \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + decay (0.36\u00b10.05) is almost twice that measured in the B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 cJ \u03c0 \u2212 K + decay mode (0.20 \u00b1 0.04). We observe that the \u03c7 c2 is more often accompanied by higher K * resonances, in contrast to the \u03c7 c1 that is dominantly produced with the lower K * resonance. All previous studies [6,7] were limited to K * (892) 0 , while our study suggests that \u03c7 c2 is preferentially produced with higher K * resonances. Clearly, to study \u03c7 c2 production in B decays, it is important to avoid considering solely the lower K * resonances. Suppression in two-body B decays is found to be due to the factorization hypothesis [9]. In our search for X(3872) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c7 c1 (2P ), we determine an U.L. on the product of branching fractions B(B + \u2192 X(3872)K + ) \u00d7 (X(3872) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [B(B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1 (2P )K + ) \u00d7 (\u03c7 c1 (2P ) \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )] < 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 [1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ] at the 90% C.L. The negative result for our searches is compatible with the interpretation of X(3872) as an admixture state of a D 0D * 0 molecule and a \u03c7 c1 (2P ) charmonium state.",
