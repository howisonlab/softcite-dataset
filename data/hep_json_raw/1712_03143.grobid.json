The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , and collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Two decay modes of the Z boson are investigated. In the leptonic channels, the Z boson candidates are reconstructed using electron or muon pairs. In the hadronic channels, they are identified using a large-radius jet, containing either light-quark or b quark decay products of the Z boson, via jet substructure and advanced b quark tagging techniques. The results from these channels are combined and interpreted in terms of upper limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction to Z\u03b3 for narrow and broad spin-0 resonances with masses between 0.35 and 4.0 TeV, providing thereby the most stringent limits on such resonances.",

            "text": "One of the key aspects of the CERN LHC physics program is the search for new resonances predicted in theories beyond the standard model (SM). Given the fairly stringent limits already set on masses of such resonances in fermionic decay channels (e.g., via dilepton or dijet searches), it is particularly interesting to explore bosonic decay channels, which can dominate if the couplings of a new resonance to fermions are suppressed. Examples of such signatures are decays into a pair of massive bosons: VV and VH, where V represents either a W or a Z boson, and H refers to the recently discovered Higgs boson [1][2][3]. The latest results from these searches at the LHC are described in refs. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] for the VV channels and in refs. [10,[16][17][18][19][20][21] for the VH channels.",

While a resonance decaying to diphotons cannot be a vector or an axial vector, due to the Landau-Yang theorem [22,23], having one of the two bosons massive alleviates this constraint.

While the results in this paper are interpreted in terms of spin-0 resonances, they are broadly applicable to spin-1 and spin-2 states, as the signal acceptance depends only weakly on the spin of the resonance [30]. Similar searches in a combination of leptonic and hadronic decay channels of the Z boson have been recently published by ATLAS [31] at \u221a s = 13 TeV and by CMS at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV [32], based on significantly smaller integrated luminosities. Other searches for Z\u03b3 resonances have been performed only in the dilepton channels. These include searches by the L3 Collaboration at the CERN LEP [33] and the D0 Collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron [34,35]. At the LHC, they have been done by ATLAS at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV [30,36,37], and CMS at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV [38], as well as by ATLAS and CMS using the combined 7 and 8 TeV data [39,40], and by ATLAS using the 13 TeV data [30] in the context of a search for the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 decay.",

The fraction of events corresponding to the merged topology, which has low background from SM sources, increases with the mass of the resonance. To optimize signal relative to background, in this paper we consider just the merged jet topology (J\u03b3), and thus the search in the hadronic channels is focused on relatively high resonance masses where the trigger for these events is efficient. We use jet substructure techniques to infer the presence of two subjets, and dedicated b tagging algorithms to identify those subjets that originate from b quark fragmentation. This provides the means to distinguish a signal from the dominant background from prompt-photon and QCD multijet production, with one of the jets spuriously passing jet substructure requirements (and, in the latter case, with another jet mimicking a photon).",

This is expected for signal leptons from Z boson decays, but is not the case for backgrounds from nonprompt leptons originating, e.g., from b hadron decays. The relative isolation of a lepton is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all relevant PF candidates within a cone around the lepton, divided by the p T of the lepton candidate. For an electron, the cone size \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 depends on its p T : JHEP09 (2018)148The electron isolation is based on the photons, and charged and neutral hadrons found in the isolation cone. Charged hadrons originating from pileup vertices are excluded from the sum. The contribution to the isolation sum from neutral pileup particles is accounted for by using the average energy density method [57]. The varying isolation cone radius in eq. (3.1) takes into account the aperture of b hadron decays as a function of their p T , and reduces the inefficiency from accidental overlap of electrons from Z boson decays and jets. For muons, a fixed cone of a size \u2206R = 0.3 is used, and the isolation is based on all charged-particle tracks within the isolation cone, excluding the candidate muon track. In the case of two spatially close muons in the event, with overlapping isolation cones, both muons are excluded from each isolation sum. This procedure, together with the use of a variable cone size for electron isolation, ensures high lepton identification efficiency even in the topologies where a Z boson has a high Lorentz boost, as expected for Z bosons produced in a decay of a heavy resonance. The relative isolation of electron and muon candidates is required to be less than 0.1. Photon identification is based on a multivariate analysis, employing a boosted decision tree algorithm [58,59]. The inputs to the algorithm include shower shape variables, isolation sums computed from PF candidates in a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.3 around the photon candidate, and variables that account for the dependences of the shower shape and isolation variables on the pileup [60]. In addition, a conversion-safe electron veto [60] is applied. Photon candidates are required to pass a working point that corresponds to a typical photon reconstruction and identification efficiency of 90%, in the photon p T range used in the analysis.",

Jets are reconstructed from PF candidates clustered using the anti-k T algorithm [54] with a distance parameter of 0.8. Charged hadrons not originating from the primary vertex are not considered in the jet clustering. Corrections based on the jet area [57] are applied to remove the energy contribution of neutral hadrons from pileup interactions. The energies of the jets are further corrected for the response function of the calorimeter. These corrections are extracted from simulation and confirmed with in situ measurements using the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3+jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [61,62]. Additional quality criteria are applied to jets to remove rare spurious noise patterns in the calorimeters, and also to suppress leptons misidentified as jets. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Jets must have p T > 200 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. The requirement on the jet \u03b7 suppresses background from \u03b3+jets and QCD multijet events, and ensures that the core of the jet is within the tracker volume of the detector (|\u03b7| < 2.5).

The pruning algorithm reclusters each jet starting from its original constituents with the Cambridge-Aachen (CA) algorithm [65] and discards soft and wide-angle recombinations in each step of the iterative CA procedure. The pruned jet mass (m pruned J ) is computed from the sum of the four-momenta of the remaining constituents, which are corrected with the same factor as has already been used in the generic jet reconstruction described above.

In order to do so, we employ subjet b tagging and N -subjettiness [67] variables (\u03c4 N ). The N -subjettiness observable measures the spatial distribution of jet constituents relative to candidate subjet axes in order to quantify how well the jet can be divided into N subjets. Subjet axes are determined by a one-pass optimization procedure, which minimizes Nsubjettiness [68]. In particular, the ratio of 2-to 1-subjettiness, \u03c4 21 = \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 , offers an excellent separation between the QCD jets and jets from vector boson decays [69], which tend to have lower \u03c4 21 values than the former.",

These subjets are classified according to the probability of their originating from b quarks, based on results from the combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) b tagging algorithm [70,71]. A jet is identified as being consistent with the Z \u2192 bb decay when at least one of its subjets satisfies the medium operating point of the CSVv2 algorithm, and the other subjet satisfies the loose operating point. The medium and loose operating points correspond to 70 and 85% (20 and 50%) in the b jet tagging efficiency for p T < 300 GeV (p T = 1 TeV), and 1-2% and 10-15% misidentification probability of a light-flavor jet, respectively. If an event contains a Z \u2192 bb candidate, it is classified as \"b tagged\". For the rest of the events, if the large-radius jet has \u03c4 21 < 0.45, we classify the event as \"\u03c4 21 tagged\". Otherwise, the event is assigned to the \"untagged\" category. These three categories are mutually exclusive and are combined for the final result. The additional classification according to the \u03c4 21 value enhances signal sensitivity by 10-15% at low to intermediate signal masses (up to \u223c2 TeV), relative to a previous analysis in the hadronic channels [32].",

A pull variable is defined in each window by the difference between the input and fitted yields, divided by the combined statistical uncertainties in the data and the fit. If the absolute value of the median in the pull distribution is found to be >0.5, an additional uncertainty is assigned to the background parametrization. A modified pull distribution is then constructed, increasing the statistical uncertainty by an extra term, denoted as the bias term. The bias term is parametrized as a smooth function of m Z\u03b3 and tuned to make the absolute value of the median of the modified pull distribution to be <0.5 in all mass windows. This additional uncertainty is included in the likelihood function by adding to the background model a component with a distribution that is the same as the signal, but a normalization coefficient distributed as a Gaussian of mean zero, and a width equal to the integral of the bias term over the signal mass window, defined as the full width at half maximum. The inclusion of this additional component takes into account the possible mismodeling of the background shape.

The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Two decay modes of the Z boson are investigated. In the leptonic channels, the Z boson candidates are reconstructed using electron or muon pairs. In the hadronic channels, they are identified using a large-radius jet, containing either light-quark or b quark decay products of the Z boson, via jet substructure and advanced b tagging techniques. The results from these channels are combined and interpreted in terms of upper limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction to Z\u03b3 for narrow (broad) spin-0 resonances with masses between 0.35 and 4.0 TeV, ranging from 50 (100) to 0.3 (1.5) fb.
