The scattered partons from hard collisions fragment and hadronize into collimated groups of particles called jets. The study of jets with high transverse momentum ( p T ) provides a test of the predictions from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and deviations from these predictions can be used to look for physics beyond the standard model. While parton scattering is an elementary QCD process that can be calculated from first principles, predictions of jet distributions require an accurate hadronization model. In this paper, several hadronization models are examined.",

The hard-scattering cross section itself can be written as an expansion in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s . The leading term in this expansion corresponds to the emission of two partons. The next term includes diagrams where an additional parton is present in the final state as a result of hard-gluon radiation (e.g. gg \u2192 ggg). Cross sections for such processes diverge when any of the three partons e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch becomes soft or when two of the partons become collinear. Finally, pQCD predicts three classes of four-jet events that correspond to the processes qq/gg \u2192 qqgg, qq/gg \u2192 qqqq and qg \u2192 qggg/qqqg, where q stands for both quarks and anti-quarks. Processes with two or more gluons in the final state receive a contribution from the triple-gluon vertex, a consequence of the non-Abelian structure of QCD.",

Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The barrel and endcap calorimeters cover a pseudorapidity region \u22123.0 < \u03b7 < 3.0. Pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan[\u03b8/2], where \u03b8 is the polar angle. The transition between barrel and endcaps happens at |\u03b7| = 1.479 for the ECAL and |\u03b7| = 1.15 for the HCAL. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 400 Hz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [5].",

The PF algorithm utilizes the best energy measurements of each particle candidate from the most suitable combination of the detector components. A cluster is formed from all the particle-flow candidates that satisfy the chosen distance parameter. The four-momentum of the jet is then defined as the sum of four-momenta of the corresponding particle-flow candidates, which results in jets with nonzero mass.  The JES correction applied to jets used in this analysis is based on highp T jet events generated by pythia6 and then simulated using Geant4, and in situ measurements with dijet and photon + jet events [30]. An average of ten minimum bias interactions occur in each pp bunch crossing (pileup), and this requires an additional correction to remove the extra energy deposited by these pileup events. The size of the correction depends on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet. The correction appears as a multiplicative factor to the jet energy, and is typically less than 1.2 and approximately uniform in \u03b7.",

The JES uncertainty has been estimated to be 2-2.5 % for PF jets [30], depending on the jet p T and \u03b7. In order to map this uncertainty to the multijet variables, all jets in the selected events are systematically shifted by the respective uncertainties, and a new set of values for the multijet variables is calculated. This causes a migration of events from an event category of a given jet multiplicity to a different jet multiplicity. The migration could be as high as 20 % for some of the event categories. The corresponding distributions are then unfolded using the standard procedure as described in Sect. 7. The difference of these values from the central unfolded results is a measure of the uncertainty owing to the JES.",

Alternatively, the response matrix is constructed by convolving the generator level distribution with the measured resolution.

The variables considered for these comparisons are three-jet mass, scaled energies of the leading and next-to-leading jet in the three-jet sample in the three-jet CM frame, four-jet mass, and the two angles \u03c7 BZ and \u03b8 NR . For the comparison plots (Figs. 5,6,7,8,9), the upper panel shows the data and the model predictions with the corresponding statistical uncertainty. For the data, the shaded area shows the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The lower panels in each plot show the ratio of MC prediction to the data for each model. Comparisons are made for two different ranges of the leading jet p T : 190 < p T < 300 GeV and p T > 500 GeV. Figure 5 shows the normalized corrected differential distribution as a function of the three-jet mass for two ranges of the leading-jet p T . The three-jet mass distribution broadens for larger p T thresholds. The models show varying degrees of success for the different ranges of leading-jet p T . Most models differ from the data in the low-mass spectrum. The pythia6 simulation provides a good description of the data in the lower p T bin, while it has a larger deviation in the higher p T bin. The mean difference is at the level of 1.8-4.0 %. Predictions from MadGraph + pythia6 and pythia8 agree with the data to within 4.5 %. herwig++ provides the worst agreement among the four models -the mean difference is at the level of 4.0-15 %. Figure 6 shows the corrected normalized differential distribution as a function of the scaled leading-jet energy in the inclusive three-jet sample. The distributions peak close to 1 and the peaks get sharper for higher leading-jet p T range. The scaled leading-jet energy x 3 is expected to follow a linear rise from 2 3 to 1 for a phase space model, which has only energy-momentum conservation, while QCD predicts a deviation from linearity at higher values of x 3 . This feature is observed in the data, particularly for higher p T bins. Only MadGraph + pythia6 provides a consistent description of the data. The agreement improves for the sample with leading-jet p T above 500 GeV. The difference between the predictions from MadGraph + pythia6 and the data are at the level of 3.5-6.1 %.  Figure 7 shows the corrected normalized differential distribution as a function of the scaled energy of the secondleading jet, x 4 , in the inclusive three-jet sample. For kinematic reasons, x 4 is expected to lie between 1/2 and 1. The distribution peaks around 0.65 for the low p T threshold sample. The peak shifts to higher values of x 4 and the distribution becomes broader for the larger p T threshold sample. Predic- tions from MadGraph + pythia6 agree with data to within 3.1 %. Predictions from pythia6 as well as pythia8 deviate by as much as 10 % or more from the data. Predictions from herwig++ also shows a large deviation at higher p T bins. Figure 8 shows comparisons of the corrected normalized differential distribution as a function of the four-jet mass for the four MC models. The distribution broadens at higher min-imum p T value. As can be seen from the figure, herwig++ provides the worst comparison. The average deviations are at the level of 15 % for many of the distributions, particularly for the sample with leading-jet p T between 190 and 300 GeV. The level of agreement for the other three MC models is better than 10 % over the entire p T region.",

Figure 9 shows similar comparisons for the Bengtsson-Zerwas angle. Because the azimuthal angle is not defined for the back-to-back jets, the opening angle between the two leading and two nonleading jets is required to be less than 160 \u2022 . As can be seen from the average deviation of the ratios from unity, predictions from MadGraph + pythia6 and herwig++ represent the data well, while those from pythia6 do poorly. Figure 10 shows the corrected normalized differential distribution as a function of the cosine of the Nachtmann-Reiter angle in the inclusive four-jet sample. Most of the models follow the broad features of the data. However, the degree of agreement with data is different among models.

            "text": "The MC models use CTEQ6 as the default PDF parametrization. There are many different PDF sets, which are based on different input data, assumptions, and parametrizations. Thus any calculation of a cross section or distributions in the simulation depends on the choice of PDF set. Also, each PDF set has its own errors from its parametric assumptions and data input to fitting. The effect of the PDF set choice on the multijet variables is calculated according to the recommendation of PDF4LHC group [41,42]. Since comparisons are made only with leading order Monte Carlo models in this paper, only two leading order PDF sets are used in this comparison: CTEQ6l and MSTW2008lo68cl [43]. The uncertainties are found to be typically at the level of 1.0-2.0 % depending on the variable type and p T range considered.",
