            "text": "For many years there have been hints that the number of muons in ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) air showers is larger than predicted by hadronic interaction models, e.g., [1]. Most recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory [2] compared the muon number in highlyinclined events to predictions using the two leading LHCtuned hadronic event generators (HEGs) for air showers, QGSJet-II-04 [3,4] and EPOS-LHC [5,6]. The observed number of muons for 10 19 eV primaries was found [7] to be 30-80% higher than the models predict assuming the primary composition inferred from the depth-of-showermaximum distribution for each given model [8,9], but the significance of the inferred muon excess is limited due to the uncertainty in the absolute energy calibration.",

            "text": "For a given primary energy and mass, the number of muons is sensitive to hadronic interactions. Typically about 25% of the final state energy in each hadronic interaction is carried by \u03c0 0 's, which immediately decay to two photons and thus divert energy from the hadronic cascade, which is the main source of muons, to the electromagnetic (EM) cascade. The hadronic cascade terminates when the energy of charged pions drops low enough that they decay before interacting, O(100 GeV). If the average fraction of EM energy per interaction were increased or decreased, or there were more or fewer generations of hadronic interactions in the cascade (which depends on the primary mass and properties of the final states such as multiplicity), the muon ground signal would be lower or higher. Therefore, a significant discrepancy between observed and predicted muon ground signal would indicate that the description of hadronic interactions is inaccurate, assuming that the composition can be properly understood.",

The measured LP and two selected LPs of an example event are shown in the top panel of Fig. 1.

The lateral distribution function of an observed event and that of two simulated events are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1.

R E rescales the total ground signal of the event approximately uniformly, while R had rescales only the contribution to the ground signal of inherently hadronic origin, which consists mostly of muons. Because the EM component of the shower is more strongly attenuated in the atmosphere than the muonic component, and the path length in the atmosphere varies as a function of zenith angle, R E and R had can be separately determined by fitting a sufficiently large sample of events covering a range of zenith angles.",

We thus concentrate on a relatively narrow energy range such that the mass composition changes rather little [8,9], while having adequate statistics. This energy range corresponds to an energy of 110 to 170 TeV in the center-of-mass reference frame of the UHECR and air nucleon, far above the LHC energy scale. Fig. 2 shows the ratio of S(1000), the ground signal size at 1000 m from the shower core [2], for the events in our sample relative to that predicted for simulated events with matching zenith angle, depth-of-shower-maximum (X max ) and calorimetric FD energy, for QGSJet-II-04 [3] and EPOS-LHC [5]. For each HEG, the analysis is done using the composition mix which reproduces the observed X max distribution [8,9]; we also show the result for pure protons for comparison.

The variance entering Equation (2) includes (a) measurement uncertainty of typically 12%, from the uncertainty in the reconstruction of S(1000), the calorimetric energy measurement, and the uncertainty in the X max scale, as well as (b) the variance in the ground signals of showers with matching LPs due to shower-to-shower fluctuations (ranging from typically 16% for proton-initiated showers to 5% for iron-initiated showers) and (c) the uncertainty in separating S \u00b5 and S EM in the simulation, and from the limited statistics of having only three simulated events (typically 10% for proton-initiated showers and 4% for iron-initated showers). Table I gives the values of R E and R had which maximize the likelihood of the observed ground signals, for the various combinations of HEGs and compositions considered. The systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction of X max , E FD and S(1000) are propagated through the analysis by shifting the reconstructed central values by their one-sigma systematic uncertainties. Fig. 4 shows the one-sigma statistical uncertainty ellipses in the R E \u2212R had plane; the outer boundaries of propagating the systematic errors are shown by the grey rectangles. The values of R had needed in the models are comparable to the corresponding muon excess detected in highlyinclined air showers [7], as is expected because at high zenith angle the non-hadronic contribution to the signal (shown with red curves in Fig. 3) is much smaller than the hadronic contribution. However the two analyses are not equivalent because a muon excess in an inclined air shower is indistinguishable from an energy rescaling, whereas in the present analysis the systematic uncertainty of the overall energy calibration enters only as a higher-order effect. Thus the significance of the discrepancy between data and model prediction is now more compelling, growing from 1.38 (1.77) sigma to 2.1 (2.9) sigma respectively for EPOS-LHC (QGSJet II-04), adding statistical and systematic errors from Fig. 6 of [7] and Table I, in quadrature.",

We applied it to hybrid showers of the Pierre Auger Observatory with energies 6-16 EeV (E CM = 110 to 170 TeV) and zenith angle 0 \u2212 60 \u2022 , to quantify the disparity between state-of-the-art hadronic interaction modeling and observed UHECR atmospheric air showers. We considered the simplest possible characterization of the model discrepancies, namely an overall rescaling of the hadronic shower, R had , and we allow for a possible overall energy calibration rescaling, R E .",

The best case, EPOS-LHC with mixed composition, requires a hadronic rescaling of R had = 1.33\u00b10.16 (statistical and systematic uncertainties combined in quadrature), while for QGSJet II-04, R had = 1.61\u00b10.21. It is not yet known whether this discrepancy can be explained by some incorrectly modeled features of hadron collisions, possibly even at low energy, or may be indicative of the onset of some new phenomenon in hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energy. Proposals of the first type include a higher level of production of baryons [27] or vector mesons [30] (see [31] for a recent review of the many constraints to be satisfied), while proposals for possible new physics are discussed in [26,29,32].",
