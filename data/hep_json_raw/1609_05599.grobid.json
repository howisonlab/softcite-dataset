The dark matter can be naturally explained by the introduction of a weakly interacting particle pre- * Corresponding author: eunil@hep.korea.ac.kr dicted in the supersymmetric extension of the SM [5]. The absence of observation of any supersymmetric particles in hadron collider experiments [6] motivates studies of new classes of models, commonly referred to as dark models, which introduce new gauge symmetries [7] and predict the existence of new particles that couple weakly to SM particles. Most accelerator-based experiments have focused on the dark photon or dark particles coupling to the SM photons [8], though many dark models suggest a new gauge boson that could couple predominantly to quarks [9,10]. This new dark boson (hereinafter referred to as the U \u2032 boson, instead of B as is originally proposed in Ref. [9], to avoid confusion with the SM B meson) can be produced from light SM meson decays through P \u2192 U \u2032 \u03b3 or V \u2192 U \u2032 P , where P refers to a pseudoscalar meson (e.g., \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) and V to a vector meson (e.g., \u03c9, \u03c6). Two recent experimental limits on searches for a dark photon A \u2032 via \u03c0 0 \u2192 A \u2032 \u03b3, A \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 [11] and \u03c6 \u2192 A \u2032 \u03b3, A \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 [12] can be applied to the U \u2032 boson search in a model-dependent way to constrain the baryonic fine structure constant \u03b1 U \u2032 \u2261 g 2 U \u2032 /(4\u03c0), where g U \u2032 is the universal gauge coupling between the U \u2032 boson and the quarks [10]. There are also limits from \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03b3 decays based on their total rate, as well as from the analysis of hadronic \u03a5(1S) decays [10].",

The upper limit as a function of the U \u2032 boson mass is shown in Fig. 4. Considering other results in this mass region, we find that our limit is stronger than that from a model-dependent analysis [10] of the \u03c6 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays [12] for m U \u2032 > 450 MeV/c 2 , but weaker than the limit based on the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3 total rate [10].
