This is due to the nonzero neutrinos masses and to their mixing [1]. A SM prediction for BF(\u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3) is approximately 10 \u221254 [2,3]. Such low BF is virtually unobservable and therefore any positive signal of such reaction would be a clear evidence of New Physics. Supersymmetric models -on the other hand -can generate flavour mixing effects [4,5,6,7,8] at a level they can be investigate by experiment of the current generation.",

The trigger is based on fast information from both TC and LXe requiring an energy deposit in the photon detector in an interval around 52.8 MeV, a time coincident positron hit on TC within 20 ns and a rough collinearity of the two particles.

The confidence region is constructed by means of toy-MC simulation with taking into account possible systematic effects. The PDFs and normalization factor are fluctuated for each toy-MC experiment in accordance with their uncertainty values. The point of N sig =0 is included in the 90% confidence interval, and an upper limit is calculated to be N sig < 14.5. This yields an upper limit on the BF",
