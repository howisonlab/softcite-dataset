In these proceedings, we present a Bayesian unfolding procedure to reconstruct the correlation between transverse momentum (p T ) spectra of charged particles and the corresponding charged-particle multiplicities N ch . The unfolded spectra are presented in single multiplicity (\u2206N ch = 1) bins and are used to derive moments of the p T distributions. We illustrate the unfolding procedure of the p T spectra with a Monte Carlo simulation for pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 5.02 TeV.",

            "text": "High energy heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide the possibility to create a hot and dense deconfined state of matter in the laboratory. One commonly used observable to study the properties of such medium is the transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum of the abundantly produced charged particles. In central heavy-ion collisions, a suppression of the charged-particle yield with respect to the yield expected from a simple superposition of nucleonnucleon collisions is observed, indicating a significant energy loss of partons traversing the quark gluon plasma. For more peripheral collisions, it is possible to directly compare the p T spectra of heavy-ion and proton-nucleus as well as proton-proton collisions at the same final state chargedparticle multiplicity N ch . It is very common to present the mean value p T of these spectra as a function of the multiplicity, as shown in the left panel of figure 1 for an ALICE measurement of Pb-Pb, p-Pb and pp collisions at different centre-of-mass energies. For all three collision systems an increase of p T with N ch is observed, being strongest for proton-proton collisions. In Pb-Pb, the average p T is significantly lower, which might be due to substantial rescattering of the particles produced in the collision. The p T vs. N ch observed in p-Pb shows a steep rise similar to the one in pp at low multiplicities and a Pb-Pb like saturating trend at high multiplicities. With the more recent ALICE datasets it is now possible to perform this measurement at the same centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair for pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb, which will provide a better comparison of the three collision systems. In addition, the variety of pp datasets measured with ALICE allows for an extensive energy scan of the multiplicity dependent p T , complementing the results shown in the right panel of figure 1. These new measurements can be used to further investigate the underlying particle production mechanisms and provide more insight into the effects of multiple-parton interactions and hadronization beyond independent string fragmentation. By extending the p T vs. N ch observable to a precise measurement of the complete p T spectra as function of multiplicity, ALICE will be able to provide even more rigorous constraints for theoretical models. In these proceedings we present an analysis method based on a Bayesian unfolding technique, which is used to obtain the p T spectra as function of N ch . The procedure is illustrated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation of pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV using the PYTHIA8 [1] event generator and a virtual model of the ALICE detector.",

Due to the limited detector efficiency, this is not equal to the true number of charged particles produced in the collisions. The probability to measure only N acc of the N ch original particles is given by the detector response P(N acc |N ch ). Events with a true multiplicity N ch can potentially be reconstructed with many different N acc and therefore contribute to various measured multiplicity-dependent p T spectra.

This suggests to update P(N ch |N acc ) accordingly and repeat the process several times in order to obtain a good estimate for the true multiplicity distribution n evt (N ch ). Further details on the iterative D'Agostini method can be found for example in [7] and [9]. To make use of this procedure for the unfolding of multiplicity-dependent p T spectra, it is important to note that one is dealing with particle distributions n par (N acc ) rather than event distributions n evt (N acc ). This implies, that the detector response needs to be defined on particle level as well, representing the probability of a charged particle originating from an event with multiplicity N ch to be measured in an event with multiplicity N acc . The unfolding is performed differentially in p T , i.e. the iterative D'Agostini procedure is applied separately for all p T intervals of the measurement. Figure 3 presents the outcome of a PYTHIA8 Monte Carlo simulation of pp collisions at a centreof-mass energy of \u221a s = 5.02 TeV propagated through a virtual model of the ALICE detector. The left panel depicts the corresponding measured p T spectra of primary charged particles in a kinematic range of 0.15 GeV/c < p T < 10 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.8 as a function of the measured multiplicity N acc . The right panel shows these spectra as a function of N ch after applying the p Tdifferential unfolding. As a self consistency check (closure test) of the unfolding method, these resulting spectra are compared to the multiplicity-dependent p T spectra produced by the underlying PYTHIA event generator (MC truth information). Figure 4 shows the first three moments of the deconvoluted p T spectra in red markers and the moments of the true spectra as black markers.",

Evidently, the unfolding yields very accurate results for all three moments of the spectra. Thus, we conclude that the iterative D'Agostini method is very successful in unsmearing the detector effects over the whole range of multiplicities and in good approximation recovers the full spectral shape.
