The pioneering times are over, and this is now a sector of \"precision physics\" at colliders. Angular distributions of the decay products of singly-produced top quarks are unique tests of the electroweak interaction. Searches for rare final states of the form t + X (where X = \u03b3 , Z, H) are very sensitive to new physics, and will enter with Run II in a very interesting zone of the parameter space of some theories. The relative sign of the Yukawa coupling of the top quark with respect to the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons will be conclusively measured very soon in the tHq final state.",

The fact that its electroweak decay is faster than the hadronisation timescale implies that the top quark exists only as a free quark, so that the effects from new physics could show up very clearly by comparing measurements with the precise standard model (SM) predictions. While the pair-production process (tt) was discovered more than twenty years ago [1,2] and entered several years ago the domain of \"precision physics\", single top-quark production has been observed at Tevatron just two years before its shut-down [3,4] and precision has generally been relatively modest until recently.",

Exactly one of the jets is required to pass a tight threshold on the likelihood of originating from a b quark (b-tagged jet) and is interpreted as coming from the decay of the top quark, and the other (failing the same threshold) as originating from the spectator quark that recoils again the top. Main backgrounds to this final state are tt and W boson produced in association with jets (W+jets). Orthogonal control regions with different multiplicities of jets and/or b-tagged jets are used to measure these backgrounds in situ or to validate the Monte Carlo models used for their predictions, or to constrain the main experimental systematics (e.g., b-tagging efficiency). QCD multi-jet events constitute a non-negligible background. Given the uncertainties in its modelling 3 it is necessary to predict the size and properties of this process by data themselves. A reliable model of this background is usually extracted by events that fail the isolation requirement or other elements of the chargedlepton selection, while fulfilling all other selection criteria. The extraction of the signal cross section is performed by both collaborations by profile likelihood fits. The fit variable is a multivariate discriminant in the case of ATLAS [28] and of some of the CMS analyses [7,29]. CMS also demonstrated the feasibility of entirely relying on a simple kinematic observable, \u03b7 j , the pseudorapidity of the jet failing b tagging [29,30]. The motivation for this different strategy is the wish to remove this implicit SM assumption, as it relies on a kinematic property of the signal events that is not significantly affected by the properties of the tbW coupling 4 .",

The measured values of R t from the ATLAS collaboration at 7 TeV [28] and the CMS collaboration at 8 TeV [30] show qualitatively similar trends and are already disfavouring some PDF sets, as illustrated in Fig. 3. With more data, differential distributions of R t as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum of the top quark will provide significant additional discriminating power. It would be interesting to verify the SM prediction for single top-quark production in pp collisions, R t = 0, but the Tevatron data set is insufficient for a measurement of R t with interesting precision. Another useful input for constraining PDFs is the measurement of the ratio of single-top cross sections between 7 and 8 TeV, as done by the CMS collaboration in the t-channel case by taking the ratio of results of the \u03b7 j -based analysis at the two centre-of-mass energies [30]. The first evidence of tW production has been reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using 7 TeV data [37,38]. The conventional 5\u03c3 threshold has been crossed with 8 TeV data [39,40]. These analyses exploit the presence of two real W bosons (the associated one, and the one from top-quark decay) by selecting events with two charged leptons (electrons or",

The DR approach consists in removing all diagrams where the associated W boson and an associated b quark form a top quark; the DS approach makes use of a subtraction term designed to locally cancel the tt contributions. While the latter approach is designed such to be gaugeinvariant, the former breaks gauge invariance explicitly, but this is demonstrated to have little practical effect.

Also implicit is the assumption of purely left-handed tbW coupling. Fig. 4  is bound to be \u2264 1 also in the extended matrix, the constraints on |V td | and |V ts | derived from precision physics [60] do not hold when their underlying assumptions (e.g., no non-SM particles in the loops) are relaxed [58]. Therefore, contrary to common intuition, additional quark generations could result in an enhancement, and not only necessarily a deficit, of the single top-quark cross section in t-channel and tW productions, due to the large parton densities of d and s quarks in the proton (much larger than the b-quark density), causing an amplification of the effect of any |V td | or |V ts | value larger than the SM expectation, which can overcome the deficit due to a smaller |V tb |.",

A particularly tricky case for the reinterpretation are single-top analyses based on multivariate techniques, because several of the input variables are related to the kinematics  of a reconstructed top quark, and the choice of the jet that is assumed to come from the decay of the top quark is made under the assumption that it is a b jet, and therefore |V tb | \u2248 1.

These are very interesting to look for in single top-quark production, where the effect of a small u-t coupling would be enhanced by the large u-quark density [9]. Formulations exist where the effect of new particles in quantum loops is absorbed by effective tuX couplings, where X can be a gluon, a photon, a Z or a H boson (read, for example, refs. [66,68]). Based on the consideration that higher-order effects mix the effects of different couplings, inducing ambiguities in the interpretation of single signatures, a global approach is advocated in ref.

            "text": "As often remarked in the literature, the top quark is the only quark that can be studied \"naked\". This comes from the very neat separation of the relevant time scales: the production time ( \u2248 1/m t , where m t \u2248 175 GeV) is two orders of magnitude smaller than its lifetime (1/ t , where t \u2248 2 GeV) which is smaller than the hadronisation time scale (\u2248 1/ QCD , where QCD \u2248 0.2 GeV) which, in turn, is an order of magnitude smaller than the spin decorrelation time (\u2248 m t / 2 QCD ). In particular, the fact that the top quark lifetime is shorter than the QCD de-coherence timescale implies that its decay products retain memory of its helicity. This provides additional powerful tools in the search for new physics in single-top studies: in single top-quark production via the t channel, the standard model predicts that top quarks are produced almost fully polarised through the V-A coupling along the direction of the momentum of the quark that recoils against the top quark [81,82], while new physics models may lead to a depolarisation in production or decay by altering the coupling structure [66,[83][84][85].",

Both P (S) t and \u03b1 X can be affected by top-quark anomalous couplings. Single-top polarisation at the production vertex in the t-channel process is manifest in the slope of the cos \u03b8 * distribution, where \u03b8 * is defined as the angle between the charged lepton and the light jet (j ) in the reconstructed top quark rest frame. The rationale for this definition is that the (light) quark recoiling against the top quark tends to have a direction parallel to the spin direction of the top quark at the production vertex [81]. The SM expectation P (S) t \u00d7 \u03b1 \u2248 1 is part of the implicit assumptions of all the multivariate analyses at Tevatron and LHC and has even been built in the foundations of the earliest t-channel cross section measurements at the LHC [7] which made use of the cos \u03b8 * distribution to identify a SM-like signal 5 . A dedicated measurement of single-top polarisation has been performed by CMS with 8 TeV data [86]. After a model-independent selection targeting t-channel production, the observed cos \u03b8 * distribution is used to infer the differential cross section as a function of the parton-level cos \u03b8 * . This is found to be compatible with the linear expectation of Eq. (2), and a linear fit yields P (S) t \u00d7 \u03b1 = 0.52 \u00b1 0.06(stat) \u00b1 0.20\u02dc(syst), compatible with the SM expectation (0.88 according to different matrix-element generators interfaced to different parton-shower programs) within two Gaussian standard deviations.",

The helicity angle \u03b8 * W is defined as the angle between the W-boson momentum in the top-quark rest frame and the momentum of the down-type fermion from the W-boson decay, in the rest frame of the mother particle. The functional form of the top quark partial decay width can be written as a function of the right-handed (F R ), left-handed (F L ) and longitudinal (F 0 ) helicity fractions of the W boson. The CMS collaboration measured these decay widths in a phase-space region defined by a selection enriched in t-channel single top-quark events [87], statistically independent from the measurements performed in tt-optimised selections [88]. Similarly to the traditional tt-based analyses, the measurement is based on the cos \u03b8 * W distribution. Although the tt and tW yields are reduced by the selection, that requires one charged lepton and exactly two jets (only one of them passing b-tagging selection), they are treated as a component of the signal as they carry information on the parameters of interest. Two out of three W-boson helicity fractions (as their sum is bound to unity) and the W+jets background contamination are treated as independent fit parameters. The results are found to be in good agreement with the tt-optimised measurements, confirming the independence of the helicity fractions from the kinematic selection, and with NNLO standard model predictions. The helicity measurements are also interpreted to set limits on the real part of the anomalous couplings g L and g R of Eq. (1).",

It is customary to also quote the 95% confidence level interval obtained with the additional unitarity constraint 0 \u2264 |V tb | \u2264 1. This way to constrain |V tb | is complementary to the measurement of R b \u2261 BR(t\u2192Wb) BR(t\u2192Wq) in tt events [54-57], where q = d, s, b, which is interpreted as R b = |V tb | 2 |V td | 2 +|V ts | 2 +|V tb | 2 and can be used to infer |V tb | directly if the additional assumption |V td | 2 + |V ts | 2 + |V tb | 2 = 1 is imposed.
