We show that large improvements in magnetic field volume, x-ray focusing optics and detector backgrounds are possible beyond those achieved in the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). For hadronic models, a sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling of g a\u03b3 few \u00d7 10 \u221212 GeV \u22121 is conceivable, 1-1.5 orders of magnitude beyond the CAST sensitivity. If axions also couple to electrons, the Sun produces a larger flux for the same value of the Peccei-Quinn scale, allowing one to probe a broader class of models. Except for the axion dark matter searches, this experiment will be the most sensitive axion search ever, reaching or surpassing the stringent bounds from SN1987A and possibly testing the axion interpretation of anomalous white-dwarf cooling that predicts m a of a few meV. Beyond axions, this new instrument will probe entirely unexplored ranges of parameters for a large variety of axion-like particles (ALPs) and other novel excitations at the low-energy frontier of elementary particle physics.",

            "text": "The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism of dynamical symmetry restoration [1,2] stands out as the most compelling solution of the strong CP problem, i. e. why this discrete symmetry is apparently not violated by the non-trivial vacuum structure of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Central to the PQ mechanism is the axion [3][4][5][6], the Nambu-Goldstone boson of a new spontaneously broken symmetry U(1) PQ , with properties closely related to those of the neutral pion. All axion properties are governed by a large energy scale f a , the axion decay constant, which is closely related to the scale of symmetry breaking. The axion mass is given by m a f a \u223c m \u03c0 f \u03c0 , where m \u03c0 = 135 MeV and f \u03c0 = 92 MeV are the pion mass and decay constant, respectively. The axion couplings with matter and radiation also scale as 1/f a . Experimental and astrophysical constraints, if taken at face value, imply that f a 10 9 GeV, corresponding to m a 10 meV [7], and so axions, despite their QCD origin, would be very light and very weakly interacting, with interaction cross sections much smaller than those of neutrinos. On the other hand, the unusual properties of axions allow them to be produced in the early universe as coherent field oscillations and as such to provide all or part of the cold dark matter [8,9]. It is still possible to find these \"invisible axions\" in realistic search experiments and in this way test a fundamental aspect of QCD. The generic a\u03b3\u03b3 vertex allows for axion-photon JCAP06(2011)013 conversion in external electric or magnetic fields in analogy to the Primakoff effect for neutral pions. As shown in 1983 by Pierre Sikivie, the smallness of the axion mass allows this conversion to take place coherently over macroscopic distances, compensating for the smallness of the interaction strength [10]. Especially promising is to use the Sun as a source for axions produced in its interior by the Primakoff effect. Directing a strong dipole magnet toward the Sun allows one to search for keV-range x-rays produced by axion-photon conversion, a process best visualized as a particle oscillation phenomenon [11] in analogy to neutrino flavor oscillations. Three such helioscopes have been built, in Brookhaven [12], Tokyo [13][14][15] and at CERN [16]. The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is currently finishing an 8-year long data taking period, having strongly improved on previous experiments and even surpassed astrophysical limits in some range of parameters, although axions have not been found.",

To overcome this limitation, the conversion pipe was filled with a buffer gas, providing the photons with a refractive mass m \u03b3 and achieving the maximum conversion rate for a narrow m a range around the m \u03b3 value defined by the gas pressure. CAST has reached the \"axion line\" defined by m a f a \u223c m \u03c0 f \u03c0 in a narrow range of masses below 1 eV by scanning many pressure settings, but of course at the price of a reduced exposure time.",

Based on these improvements, a new generation axion helioscope (NGAH) could search for axions that are 1-1.5 orders of magnitude more weakly interacting than those allowed by current CAST constraints. If the ambitious goals defined in our study can be achieved, a much larger range of realistic axion models can be probed and it is even conceivable that one can reach a sensitivity corresponding to m a in the 10 meV range. This mass range would be significant in several ways. The energy-loss limit from SN 1987A suggests that QCD axions have f a 10 9 GeV or m a 10-20 meV as mentioned earlier. Moreover, if axions also interact with electrons, axions nearly saturating the SN 1987A limit could explain the apparent anomalous energy loss of white dwarfs [17][18][19][20]. On the experimental side, if the magnet length is 10 m as in CAST, the sensitivity loss caused by the axion-photon momentum transfer begins at m a 20 meV. In other words, if one can \"cross the axion line\" at around this mass one can probe a large range of axion models without buffer gas filling or with only few simple pressure settings. For the first time, it appears conceivable to surpass the SN 1987A constraint, test the white-dwarf cooling hypothesis, and begin to explore entirely uncharted axion territory experimentally.",

The allowed range z = 0.35-0.60 [34] leads to about a 10% uncertainty that we will henceforth ignore. The role of axions in QCD implies that they must interact with hadrons and photons based on their generic a-\u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing, even though one can construct models where some of these couplings can be accidentally small by cancelation effects. In addition, notably in GUT models, axions can interact with leptons. If such interactions are absent, we speak of hadronic axions, if lepton couplings exist, of non-hadronic axions. For the latter, the axionelectron interaction is of greatest practical interest.

It is therefore natural to discuss the status of ALP and hadronic axion searches in the two-dimensional m a -g a\u03b3 parameter space (figure 2). In this way we can clearly show three main frontlines in the direct search for hadronic axions: dark matter axions, solar axions and laboratory axions. Dark matter axion experiments, of which ADMX is the only active example, are sensitive down to very low g a\u03b3 values at the very low mass range broadly circumscribed by 1-100 \u00b5eV. ADMX contemplates the exploration of the 1-10 \u00b5eV decade with sufficient sensitivity in g a\u03b3 to exclude or detect the QCD axion band, corresponding to g a\u03b3 in the approximate range 10 \u221217 -10 \u221214 GeV \u22121 . And subsequently, assuming the success of a dedicated R&D program, the technique could also be applied to the next decade in mass, up to 100 \u00b5eV. However, for axion masses above this value, or much below 1 \u00b5eV, the resonant cavity technique becomes impractical. Solar axion searches, although not reaching such low g a\u03b3 values, are sensitive to a very wide range of axion and ALP masses. As detailed later on, the most recent CAST results set the most stringent limits for ALP masses up to the eV scale.",

Of course, it may be unwise to rely entirely on a single observation with sparse statistics and intrinsic uncertainties [7] to consider an entire class of models excluded. Therefore, it is both of conceptual and practical interest that in phase II of CAST one begins to probe realistic axion models, even at the price of the very cumbersome scanning through many pressure settings of the buffer gas.",

Photons propagating in galactic or intergalactic magnetic fields can oscillate into ALPs -or vice versa-, altering the properties of light propagation in our universe. Particularly interesting issues are the observation of \u03b3-rays, e. g. [57,58], and ultra high energy cosmic rays [59,60] from very distant sources, such as active galactic nuclei.

From the theoretical point of view, these models are very appealing since they arise for instance in grand unified theories (GUTs), strongly motivated completions of the standard model at high energies. From the phenomenological side it is worth repeating that naturally the coupling to electrons leads to larger axion fluxes from stars than the coupling to photons, offering enhanced fluxes to a NGAH. Of course, this also strengthens the purely astrophysical bounds. In the case of the Sun, agreement between the measured and predicted solar neutrino flux constrains the energy loss in axions to be below 10% of the solar luminosity [72], which translates into a bound g ae < 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u221211 [45]. A more stringent bound comes from the delay of helium ignition in red giants of globular clusters, namely g ae < 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u221213 [73,74].",

However, the helioscope signal depends upon the combination (g ae g a\u03b3 ) 2 , since the photon coupling determines the detection rate and the electron coupling the axion production in the Sun, unless the electron coupling is unnaturally small. We here do not worry about the fine-tuned case where the photon and electron couplings provide comparable solar fluxes. The sensitivity of helioscopes to non-hadronic axions is then better appreciated in the m a -C e C \u03b3 plane shown on the right panel of figure 4. In order to compare with the red-giant bound and the WD motivated region one must fix the parameter C \u03b3 . For non-hadronic models the GUT assumption E/N = 8/3 is probably the best motivated case, leading to C \u03b3 = 0.75 as discussed earlier. With this assumption, the red giant bound is shown as a diagonal dashed line in the plot on the right panel of figure 4, whereas the orange band of the same plot refers to the generous range 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u221213 < g ae < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221213 , motivated by WD cooling. The DFSZ models [32,33], for which C e = (cos 2 \u03b2)/3 < 1/3, are bound by the labeled horizontal line. Although CAST sensitivity is not well tuned to search for non-hadronic axions, we will show that advances surveyed in this paper could make a NGAH surpass the red giant constraints and start probing the region of parameter space highlighted by the cooling of WDs.",

This region includes, on the high-mass side, a large set of plausible QCD axion models, potentially superseding the SN 1987A and red-giant bound in non-hadronic models and start probing the parameters suggested by the longstanding anomalous WD cooling. At lower axion masses, this region includes the ALP parameters invoked repeatedly by several works as being behind some astrophysical phenomena. This region is currently not excluded by any experimental results or astrophysical limits and moreover, it is out of reach for other foreseeable experimental techniques, except maybe a next generation [44,76,77] of photon regeneration experiment using resonant techniques, and this only in the sub meV mass range. We will argue that for a new generation axion helioscope such enhancements are technically feasible, by reasonably extending the innovations introduced by CAST. We propose such an experiment as the next large scale project that the experimental axion community should envisage for the next decade.",

Additionally, in the event of a positive signal and actual detection, such an optic would become a real \"axion-imaging\" telescope. The CAST CCD is coupled to one such device [82], a Wolter telescope borrowed from the field of x-ray astronomy, that enhances its signal-to-background ratio by two orders of magnitude. Second, CAST has actively and continually applied state-of-the-art low background techniques to all its detector subsystems, in order to minimize the experimental background and further increase the sensitivity. These include the use of low radioactivity materials for the detector components and surroundings, the simulation and modeling of backgrounds, the use of shielding against external radiation, and the development of sophisticated offline analysis criteria to discriminate signal events and reject background.",

The data acquired in 2006 [80], with 4 He as the buffer gas, scanned for axion masses up to 0.39 eV at a level for axion-photon couplings down to \u223c 2.2\u00d710 \u221210 GeV \u22121 , entering into the QCD axion model band, as shown in figure 2. To gain access to higher masses, in 2007 the buffer gas was switched to 3 He to avoid gas condensation at the required pressure. The experiment is currently engaged in a systematic scan of axion masses above 0.4 eV. The 3 He data taking began in 2008, and upon completion of this research program in the middle of 2011, CAST will have explored an axion mass up to \u223c 1.2 eV, overlapping with the cosmological upper limit on the axion mass discussed above.",

They include two data taking campaigns for each of the scenarios: one three years long performed without buffer gas (analogous to CAST I), and another three years long period with varying amounts of 4 He gas inside the magnet bore (analogous to CAST II, although without the need to use 3 He). This second phase is responsible for the step in the sensitivity line from mass of \u223c0.05 eV up to 0.25 eV.

However, the needed margin for the required improvement in the magnet FOM can still not be reached. Therefore, the magnet's aperture is the only parameter left that can be significantly enhanced and thus we shall base our possible magnet design by concentrating on it. We must stress that thanks to the use of x-ray optics at the end of the magnet bore, the enlargement of the magnet aperture does imply an enhancement of the expected signal without necessarily implying an increase of background.

Needless to say, for this relation to hold, one assumes the optics size is enlarged accordingly to couple the magnet bore down to the stated focal spot size. It should also be noted here that the magnetic field B in an axion helioscope magnet must be perpendicular to the longitudinal (axion incoming) direction. More correctly, only the perpendicular components of B, with respect to the axion beam momentum, will contribute to the conversion probability. Accelerator dipole magnets, like the one CAST is currently using, have additional design constraints that are not required by a NGAH use, with the most important constraint being the extraordinary quality of the magnetic field (i. e. the field is required to be extremely uniform within the accelerator's aperture). Moreover, accelerator type magnets cannot reach apertures wide enough to improve the magnet FOM significantly. For example, a CAST like magnet with a 9 T magnetic field and 9.26 m length will need a 620 mm aperture, which is clearly not achievable in the near future, in order to improve the relative FOM by a factor of just 100. However, by considering different designs of detector magnets, 2 e. g. the ones of the ATLAS or the AMS experiments, which are characterized by a very large volume and a lower field (compared to accelerator magnets), it seems feasible to reach the required FOM, in particular regarding apertures of up to several meters with rather intense fields. A complete feasibility study is currently in progress to define the simplest magnet design that satisfies the requirements of a NGAH and optimizes the FOM within the use of current magnet technologies at CERN. The ATLAS experiment at CERN is using an enormous central toroid magnet [84], known as the barrel toroid, of 25.3 m in length with 20.1 m and 9.4 in outer and inner diameters, respectively (see figure 5) . This toroid has a peak field of 3.9 T at the coils which generate an average field of about 0.8 T in the useful aperture (that is, the aperture that would have been used for solar axions search) for a current of 20.5 kA. The NGAH can rely on these numbers and the barrel toroid design in order to scale it down and optimize it for axions search. Since the useful diameter for the optics detector is not more than 1 m, the NGAH has the advantage of having a smaller width and hence maintaining a higher useful field in the aperture. First considerations seem to favor a configuration in which 8 vacuum bores, of relatively large size (0.5-1 m diameter), are placed between the coils and are available to couple optics and detectors. This configuration is demonstrated in figure 6, where a crosssection of the geometry is shown. The magnetic field in the bores, although not homogeneous, is largely perpendicular to the axion directions. With this type of configuration, it appears possible to reach a magnet length similar or somewhat longer than CAST (15-20 m), with B peak fields not much less (about 6 T) and a total cross sectional magnetic area of around 1-3 m 2 . The average field in the aperture (i. e. the vacuum bores) is about 2.5-3 T, thus providing a FOM in the range of 100-350 relative to CAST, already reaching or surpassing the values stated in scenarios NGAH-1 and NGAH-2 of table 1.",

The dipole bore can contain 6-8 apertures with an average field of about 1.5 T, while the peripheral shielding coils give additional 2 apertures with an average field of 2.5 -3 T and 4 apertures (when using 4 shielding coils and not 6 as in the original AMS design) with an average field of 2.5 T. Overall, this geometry will not yield a higher FOM  than the one that can be gained with the toroidal design and will also have the disadvantage of using more cable, which increases the overall costs of the NGAH. Moreover, another disadvantage of the AMS geometry is that it sustains higher stress than the ATLAS geometry since the toroidal geometry is self supported thanks to its symmetry.

This relation yields a JCAP06(2011)013  straight line in the (B, J) phase space. The portion of this line, which extends from the origin of the (B, J) space to the critical surface is called the \"load line\" of the magnet. In the magnet designers' jargon, it is common to refer to the operational margin by the so called percentage on the load line. For example, the operational margin of the LHC main dipoles is set at 20% on the load line [86]. This expression means that the magnet's operating values, namely the current density and the magnetic field, are those given by the point (called the magnet's working point) in the (B, J) phase space which will mark 0.8 of the magnet's load line length, for a given temperature (1.9 K for the LHC). The smaller the operational margin is, the closer the magnet is to its quench point. Most detector type magnets usually work at lower fields and hence have a relatively large operational margin. However, as mentioned, the NGAH magnet will have to sustain the highest possible fields. Thus, the operational margin will inevitably be reduced and the NGAH will have to combine the protection techniques commonly used for both detector and accelerator magnets. Consequently, the protection of the NGAH magnet may be the most challenging part of the design.",

A possible way to increase the operational margin, for a given temperature, is by adding more SC to the magnet while at the same time reducing the current density. Thus, by increasing the number of current sources, the same field can be maintained for a lower current density. This can be done in two ways: the straight forward way will be to increase the number of turns in the coil, or more simply, using more cable. However, additional turns make the magnet's coil, and hence the cold mass (i. e. the coils and their supporting structure) as well, bigger. Therefore, the resulting magnet will have JCAP06(2011)013 an aperture bigger than the area that can be covered by the optics and this might result in a reduced efficiency (depending on the gain in the magnetic field).

The paraboloid and hyperboloid shapes can be approximated by truncated cones [95]. Although on-axis resolution is sacrificed, these so-called conical approximation or Wolter-I-like designs have good off-axis performance and can be considerably less complex and less expensive to fabricate.",

Additionally, the physical size of the optic will influence the overall design of the infrastructure required for the NGAH (e. g. tracking platform and the structure in which the experiment will be housed) and thus will also influence costs. It is beyond the scope of this paper to present the results of a full design of an x-ray optic intended for the NGAH.

For example, eRosita will re-use the mandrels originally produced for ABRIXAS [118]. This approach would only work for NGAH if an exact duplicate would be appropriate. This is because the replication process does not allow for easy modification of the master mandrels. Shaping mandrels and other tooling are required to make either segmented glass or aluminum substrates, and this may be a more suitable hardware to exploit for the NGAH. For example, the equipment used to make NuSTAR might be available for new projects, once all the flight hardware is complete.

The x-rays interact in the conversion volume that, in our case, needs to be at least 3 cm thick in order to keep a good detection efficiency. The ionization then drifts towards the proper Micromegas readout [125,126] which consists of a metallic micromesh suspended over a pixellised anode plane by means of insulator pillars, defining an amplification gap in the range 25-150 \u00b5m. The drifting electrons go through the micromesh holes and trigger an avalanche inside the gap, inducing detectable signals both in the anode pixels and in the mesh. It is known [127] that the way the amplification develops in a Micromegas gap is such that its gain G is less dependent on geometrical factors (the gap size) or environmental ones (like the temperature or pressure of the gas) than conventional multiwire planes or other types of micropattern detectors based on charge amplification. This fact allows in general for higher time stability and spatial homogeneity in the response of Micromegas. In addition, the amplification in the Micromegas gap has less inherent statistical fluctuations than that of multiwire proportional chambers (MWPCs), due to the faster transition from the drift field to the amplification field provided by the micromesh [128]. The possibility of patterning the anode in pixels or strips of very high granularity coupled with appropriate electronics allows one to extract precious topological information of the event. This fact, together with the rich topology offered by the gaseous detection medium, has proven essential to design efficient algorithms of signal identification and background substraction in CAST [129]. The 2-D readout pattern imprinted in the CAST Micromegas is sketched in left panel of figure 9, and is composed by 400 \u00b5m side pixels linked in horizontal and vertical strips. This granularity typically yields offline background reductions of a around a factor 100 or more, depending on the event energy.",

It allows to provide, like the bulk, all-in-one readouts but out of double-clad kapton foils. The mesh is etched out of one of the copper layers of the foil, and the Micromegas gap is created by removing part of the kapton by means of appropriate chemical baths and photolithographic techniques. The mechanical homogeneity of the gap and mesh geometry is superior, and in fact these Micromegas have achieved the best energy resolutions among MPGDs with charge amplification. Because of this, gain stability of microbulk readouts is also superior. In addition, the readout can be made extremely light and most of the raw material is kapton and copper, two of the materials known to be (or to achieve) the best levels of radiopurity [131]. Indeed, the first radiopurity study of Micromegas [132] shows that current microbulk readouts contain radioactivity levels at least as low as 57 \u00b1 25 \u00b5Bq/cm 2 for 40 K, 26 \u00b1 14 \u00b5Bq/cm 2 for 238 U, < 13.9 \u00b5Bq/cm 2 for 235 U and < 9.3 \u00b5Bq/cm 2 for 232 Th. These levels are comparable to the cleanest materials used in the detectors of the currently most stringent low background experiments, e. g. in dark matter or double beta decay experiments performed in underground laboratories. Other materials composing the detector body are also chosen to have low radioactivity levels (copper, plexiglass, etc. . . ). Figure 10.

This level corresponds already to the one anticipated in the scenario NGAH-2 of table 1. Although work is still in progress, preliminary considerations point to the fact that further background reduction is possible beyond the one already obtained via shielding improvements. The radiopurity of some materials entering the detector components is still improvable (some glues, connectors, feedthroughts and others). There is also margin to improve at offline analysis, especially by going to better readout electronics providing 3D topological information. Finally, the use of an inner anticompton veto is also being studied. A quantitative estimation of the expected improvement that these factors could yield in background reduction is still pending, but a further factor 3 or 10 (corresponding to scenarios 3 and 4 of table 1) are certainly not unrealistic perspectives. All these points will be explored in a dedicated prototyping R&D which is already ongoing. ",
