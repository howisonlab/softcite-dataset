The accurate knowledge of properties of heavy flavor hadrons, especially b hadrons, plays an essential role for determining the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [1,2]. The operation of the Belle and BaBar e + e \u2212 B factory experiments led to a large increase in the size of available Bmeson, D-hadron and \u03c4 -lepton samples, enabling dramatic improvement in the accuracies of related measurements. The CDF and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron have also provided important results in heavy flavour physics, most notably in the B 0 s sector. In the D-meson sector, the dedicated e + e \u2212 charm factory experiments CLEO-c and BESIII have made significant contributions. Run I of the CERN Large Hadron Collider delivered high luminosity, enabling the collection of even larger samples of b and c hadrons, and thus a further leap in precision in many areas, at the ATLAS, CMS, and (especially) LHCb experiments. With the LHC Run II ongoing, further improvements are keenly anticipated.",

In some cases where the matrices are large, it is inconvenient to report them in this document; however, all results can be found on the HFLAV web pages. The value of \u03c7 2 (x) provides a measure of the consistency of the independent measurements of x after accounting for the number of degrees of freedom (dof), which is the difference between the number of measurements and the number of fitted parameters: N \u2022 n \u2212 n. The values of \u03c7 2 (x) and dof are typically converted to a confidence level (C.L.) and reported together with the averages. In cases where \u03c7 2 /dof > 1, we do not usually scale the resulting uncertainty, in contrast to what is done by the Particle Data Group [6]. Rather, we examine the systematic uncertainties of each measurement to better understand them. Unless we find systematic discrepancies among the measurements, we do not apply any additional correction to the calculated error. If special treatment is necessary to calculate an average, or if an approximation used in the calculation might not be sufficiently accurate (e.g., assuming Gaussian errors when the likelihood function exhibits non-Gaussian behavior), we include a warning message. Further modifications to the averaging procedures for non-Gaussian situations are discussed in Sect. 2.2. For observables such as branching fractions, experiments typically report upper limits when the signal is not significant. Sometimes there is insufficient information available to combine upper limits on a parameter obtained by different experiments; in this case we usually report only the most restrictive upper limit. For branching fractions of leptonflavor-violating decays of tau leptons, we calculate combined upper limits as discussed in Sect. 9.6.",

We thus use the values of y i and y i assumed by each measurement in our averaging (we refer to these values as y k,i and y k,i ). To properly treat correlated systematic uncertainties among measurements requires decomposing the overall systematic uncertainties into correlated and uncorrelated components. As different measurements often quote different types of systematic uncertainties, achieving consistent definitions in order to properly treat correlations requires close coordination between HFLAV and the experiments. In some cases, a group of systematic uncertainties must be combined into a coarser description in order to obtain an average that is consistent among measurements. Systematic uncertainties that are uncorrelated with any other source of uncertainty are combined together with the statistical error, so that the only systematic uncertainties treated explicitly are those that are correlated with at least one other measurement via a consistently-defined external parameter y i . When asymmetric statistical or systematic uncertainties are quoted by experiments, we symmetrize them since our combination method implicitly assumes Gaussian likelihoods (or parabolic log likelihoods) for each measurement. The fact that a measurement of x is sensitive to y i indicates that, in principle, the data used to measure x could also be used for a simultaneous measurement of x and y i . This is illustrated by the large contour in Fig. 1a. However, there often exists an external constraint y i on y i (represented by the horizontal band in Fig. 1a) that is more precise than the constraint \u03c3 (y i ) from the x data alone. In this case one can perform a simultaneous fit to x and y i , including the external constraint, and obtain the filled (x, y) contour and dashed one-dimensional estimate of x shown in Fig. 1a. For this procedure one usually takes the external constraint y i to be Gaussian.",

Their product is equal to f +\u2212 = 0.516 \u00b1 0.019, while another combination of them gives f +\u2212 + f 00 = 1.003 \u00b1 0.029, compatible with unity. Assuming 3 f +\u2212 + f 00 = 1, also consistent with CLEO's observation that the fraction of \u03a5 (4S) 3 A few non-BB decay modes of the \u03a5 (4S) (\u03a5 (1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03a5 (2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03a5 (1S)\u03b7) have been observed with branching fractions of the order of 10 \u22124 [13][14][15], corresponding to a partial width several times larger than that in the e + e \u2212 channel. However, this can still be neglected and the assumption f +\u2212 + f 00 = 1 remains valid in the present context of the determination of f +\u2212 and f 00 . decays to B B pairs is larger than 0.96 at 95% CL [16], the results of Eqs. (18) and (19) can be averaged (first converting Eq. (18) into a value of f 00 = 1/(R +\u2212/00 + 1)) to yield the following more precise estimates: f 00 = 0.486 \u00b1 0.006, f +\u2212 = 1 \u2212 f 00 = 0.514 \u00b1 0.006, f +\u2212 f 00 = 1.058 \u00b1 0.024.",

            "text": "At high energy, all species of weakly decaying b hadrons may be produced, either directly or in strong and electromagnetic decays of excited b hadrons. It is often assumed that the fractions of these different species are the same in unbiased samples of highp T b jets originating from Z 0 decays, from pp collisions at the Tevatron, or from pp collisions at the LHC. This hypothesis is plausible under the condition that the square of the momentum transfer to the produced b quarks, Q 2 , is large compared with the square of the hadronization energy scale, Q 2 \u039b 2 QCD . On the other hand, there is no strong argument that the fractions at different machines should be strictly equal, so this assumption should be checked experimentally. The available data show that the fractions depend on the kinematics of the produced b hadron. A simple phenomenological model appears to agree with all data and indicates that the fractions are constant if the b hadron is produced with sufficiently high transverse momentum from any collider. Unless otherwise indicated, these fractions are assumed to be equal at all high-energy colliders until demonstrated otherwise by experiment. Both CDF and LHCb report a p T dependence for \u039b 0 b production relative to B + and B 0 ; the number of \u039b 0 b baryons observed at low p T is enhanced with respect to that seen at LEP's higher p T . Therefore we present three sets of complete averages: one set including only measurements performed at LEP, a second set including only measurements performed at the Tevatron, a third set including measurements performed at LEP, Tevatron and LHC. The LHCb production fractions results by themselves are still incomplete, lacking measurements of the production of weakly-decaying baryons heavier than \u039b 0 b . 5 The results of Ref. [27] are not included in the average since no numerical value is given for f",

Decays of the type B * * 0 s \u2192 B ( * ) K also contribute to the B + and B 0 rates, but with the same magnitude if mass effects can be neglected. We therefore assume equal production of B + and B 0 mesons.

LHCb reported 3\u03c3 evidence that the ratio R s = f s / f d decreases with p T using fully reconstructed B 0 s and B 0 decays and theoretical predictions for branching ratios [47]. Data from the ATLAS experiment [49] using decays of B 0 s and B 0 to J/\u03c8 final states and using theoretical predictions for branching ratios [50] indicates that R s is consistent with no p T dependence. Figure 5 shows the ratio R s as a function of p T measured by LHCb and ATLAS. Two fits are performed. The first fit, using a linear parameterization, yields R s = (0.2701 \u00b1 0.0058) \u2212 (0.00139 \u00b1 0.00044)[GeV/c] \u22121 \u00d7 p T . A second fit, using a simple exponential, yields R s = exp (\u22121.304 \u00b1 0.024) \u2212 (0.0058 \u00b1 0.0019)[GeV/c] \u22121 \u00d7 p T . The two fits are nearly indistinguishable over the p T range of the results, but the second gives a physical value for all p T . R s is also calculated for LEP and placed at the approximate p T for the b hadron, though the LEP result doesn't participate in the fit. Our world average for R s is also included in the figure for reference.",

The kinematic regime of the charm+lepton system reconstructed in each experiment is also shown the p T spectrum. 10  Table 4 compares the p T -weighted LHCb data with comparable averages from CDF. The average CDF and LHCb data are in agreement despite the b hadrons being produced in different kinematic regimes. Ignoring p T dependence, all these published results have been adjusted to the latest branching fraction averages [6] and combined following the procedure and assumptions described in Ref. [3], to yield f u = f d = 0.404 \u00b1 0.006, f s = 0.102 \u00b1 0.005 and f baryon = 0.090 \u00b1 0.012 under the constraints of Eq. (27). Repeating the combinations for LEP and the Tevatron, we obtain f u = f d = 0.412 \u00b1 0.008, f s = 0.088 \u00b1 0.013 and f baryon = 0.089 \u00b1 0.012 when using the LEP data only, and f u = f d = 0.340 \u00b1 0.021, f s = 0.101 \u00b1 0.015 and f baryon = 0.218 \u00b1 0.047 when using the Tevatron data only. As noted previously, the LHCb data are insufficient to determine a complete set of b-hadron production fractions. The world averages (LEP, Tevatron and LHC) for the various fractions are presented here for comparison with previous averages. Significant differences exist between the LEP and Tevatron fractions, therefore use of the world averages should be taken with some care. For these combinations other external inputs are used, e.g., the branching ratios of B mesons to final states with a D or D * in semileptonic decays, which are needed to evaluate the fraction of semileptonic B 0 s decays with a D \u2212 s in the final state.",

The coefficients c n of this expansion, known as the Operator Product Expansion [61], can be calculated perturbatively. Hence, the HQE predicts H b in the form of an expansion in both \u039b QCD /m b and \u03b1 s (m b ). The precision of current experiments requires an expansion up to the next-toleading order in QCD, i.e., the inclusion of corrections of the order of \u03b1 s (m b ) to the c n terms. The non-perturbative parts of the calculation are grouped into the expectation values H b |O n |H b of operators O n . These can be calculated using lattice QCD or QCD sum rules, or can be related to other observables via the HQE. One may reasonably expect that powers of \u039b QCD /m b provide enough suppression that only the first few terms of the sum in Eq. (32) matter. Theoretical predictions are usually made for the ratios of the lifetimes (with \u03c4 (B 0 ) often chosen as the common denominator) rather than for the individual lifetimes, for this allows several uncertainties to cancel. The precision of the HQE calculations (see Refs. [62][63][64][65][66][67], and Refs. [68,69] for the latest updates) is in some instances already surpassed by the measurements, e.g., in the case of \u03c4 (B + )/\u03c4 (B 0 ). More accurate predictions are now a matter of progress in the evaluation of the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements, in particular using lattice QCD where significant advances were made in the last decade. However, the following important conclusions can be drawn from the HQE, even in its present state, which are in agreement with experimental observations:",

The B 0 s /B 0 s production asymmetry at LHCb and the CP asymmetry due to mixing have been measured to be compatible with zero with a precision below 3% [132] and 0.3% [see Eq. (83)], respectively. The corresponding effects on the flavour-specific lifetime, which therefore have a relative size of the order of 10 \u22125 or smaller, can be neglected at the current level of experimental precision. Under the assumption of no production asymmetry and no CP violation in mixing, Eq. (39) is exact even for a flavour-specific decay with CP violation in the decay amplitudes. Hence any flavour-specific decay mode can be used to measure the flavour-specific lifetime. The average of all flavour-specific B 0 s lifetime measurements [95,104,[116][117][118][119][120][121][122] is \u03c4 single (B 0 s \u2192 flavour specific) = 1.516 \u00b1 0.014 ps. \u2022 B 0 s \u2192J/\u03c8\u03c6 decays contain a well-measured mixture of CP-even and CP-odd states.

A caveat is that different experimental acceptances may lead to different admixtures of the CP-even and CP-odd states, and simple fits to a single exponential may result in inherently different values of \u03c4 single (B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6). Analyses that separate the CP-even and CP-odd components in this decay through a full angular study, outlined in Sect. 3.3.2, provide directly precise measurements of 1/ s and s (see Table 21).",

In this context, they interpret the 2.5\u03c3 difference between theory and experiment as being due to either new physics or a sizable duality violation. The key message is that improved experimental precision on this ratio is very welcome. The ratio \u03c4 (\u039b 0 b )/\u03c4 (B 0 ) has particularly been the source of theoretical scrutiny since earlier calculations using the HQE [55][56][57]155] predicted a value larger than 0.90, almost 2 \u03c3 above the world average at the time. Many predictions cluster around a most likely central value of 0.94 [159]. Calculations of this ratio that include higher-order effects predict a lower ratio between the \u039b 0 b and B 0 lifetimes [65][66][67] and reduce this difference. Since then the experimental average is now definitely settling at a value significantly larger than initially, in agreement with the latest theoretical predictions. A recent review [68,69] concludes that the long-standing \u039b 0 b lifetime puzzle is resolved, with a nice agreement between the precise experimental determination of \u03c4 (\u039b 0 b )/\u03c4 (B 0 ) and the less precise HQE prediction which needs new lattice calculations. There is also good agreement for the \u03c4 (",

As can be seen in the above expressions, the mixing probabilities depend on three mixing observables: m q , q , and |q q / p q | 2 , which signals CP violation in the mixing if |q q / p q | 2 = 1.

Although a variety of different techniques have been used, the individual m d results obtained at different colliders have remarkably similar precision. The systematic uncertainties are comparable to the statistical uncertainties; they are often dominated by sample composition, mistag probability, or b-hadron lifetime contributions. Before being combined, the measurements are adjusted on the basis of a common set of input values, including the averages of the bhadron fractions and lifetimes given in this report (see Sects. 3.1, 3.2). Some measurements are statistically correlated. Systematic correlations arise both from common physics sources (fractions, lifetimes, branching ratios of b hadrons), and from purely experimental or algorithmic effects (efficiency, resolution, flavour tagging, background description). Combining all published measurements listed in Table 15 and accounting for all identified correlations as described in Ref. [3] yields m d = 0.5065 \u00b1 0.0016 \u00b1 0.0011 ps \u22121 .",

These studies use both untagged and tagged B 0 s candidates and are optimized for the measurement of the CPviolating phase \u03c6 ccs s , defined later in Sect. 3.3.4. The LHCb collaboration analyzed the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decay, considering that the K + K \u2212 system can be in a P-wave or S-wave state, and measured the dependence of the strong phase difference between the P-wave and S-wave amplitudes as a function of the K + K \u2212 invariant mass [111].

In such decays, e.g. semileptonic B 0 s decays, there is an equal mix of the heavy and light mass eigenstates at time zero. The proper time distribution is then a superposition of two exponential functions with decay constants sL and sH . This provides sensitivity to both 1/ s and ( s / s ) 2 . Ignoring s and fitting for a single exponential leads to an estimate of s with a relative bias proportional to ( s / s ) 2 , as shown in Eq. (39). Including the constraint from the world-average flavour-specific B 0 s lifetime, given in Eq. (40), leads to the results shown in the last column of Table 17. These world averages are displayed as the grey contours labelled \"Combined\" in the plots of Fig. 7. They correspond to the lifetime averages 1/ s = 1.505 \u00b1 0.005 ps, 1/ sL = 1.413 \u00b1 0.006 ps, 1/ sH = 1.609 \u00b1 0.010 ps, and to the decay-width difference s = +0.086 \u00b1 0.006 ps \u22121 and s / s = +0.130 \u00b1 0.009.",

Indeed the time-integrated measurements of \u03c7 (see Sect. 3.1.3), when compared to our knowledge of \u03c7 d and the b-hadron fractions, indicated that \u03c7 s should be close to its maximal possible value of 1/2. Many searches of the time dependence of this mixing were performed by ALEPH [210], DELPHI [114,118,165,211], OPAL [212,213], SLD [214,215], CDF (Run I) [216] and D0 [217] but did not have enough statistical power and proper time resolution to resolve the small period of the B 0 s oscillations. B 0 s oscillations have been observed for the first time in 2006 by the CDF collaboration [218], based on samples of flavour-tagged hadronic and semileptonic B 0 s decays (in flavour-specific final states), partially or fully reconstructed in 1 fb \u22121 of data collected during Tevatron's Run II. More recently the LHCb collaboration obtained the most precise results using fully reconstructed [219,220]. LHCb has also observed B 0 [182]. The measurements of m s are summarized in Table 18.",

As discussed in more detail later in this section, the D0 analysis with single muons and like-sign dimuons [195] separates the B 0 and B 0 s contributions by exploiting the dependence on the muon impact parameter cut; including the A d SL result quoted by D0 in the average yields A d SL = \u22120.0010 \u00b1 0.0018. All the other B 0 analyses performed at high energy, either at LEP or at the Tevatron, did not separate the contributions from the B 0 and B 0 s mesons. Under the assumption of no CP violation in B 0 s mixing (A s SL = 0), a number of these early analyses [52,87,168,226] quote a measurement of A d SL or |q d / p d | for the B 0 meson. However, these imprecise determinations no longer improve the world average of A d SL . The latter assumption makes sense within the Standard Model, since A s SL is predicted to be much smaller than A d SL [60,107], but may not be suitable in the presence of new physics.",

Given the current size of the experimental uncertainties, there is still significant room for a possible new physics contribution, in particular in the B 0 s system. In this respect, the deviation of the D0 dimuon asymmetry [195] from expectation has generated a lot of excitement. However, the recent A s SL and A d SL results from LHCb are not precise enough yet to settle the issue. It was pointed out [238] that the D0 dimuon result can be reconciled with the SM expectations of A s SL and A d SL if there were non-SM sources of CP violation in the semileptonic decays of the b and c quarks. A recent Run 1 ATLAS study [239] of charge asymmetries in muon+jets tt events, in which a b-hadron decays semileptonically to a soft muon, yields results with limited statistical precision, compatible both with the D0 dimuon asymmetry and with the SM predictions. More experimental data, especially from Run 2 of LHC, is awaited eagerly. At the more fundamental level, CP violation in B 0 s mixing is caused by the weak phase difference \u03c6 s 12 defined in Eq. (63). The SM prediction for this phase is tiny [60,107], \u03c6 s,SM",

The main observable is the CP-violating phase \u03c6 ccs s , defined as the weak phase difference between the B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing amplitude M s 12 and the b \u2192 ccs decay amplitude. The golden mode for such studies is B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6, followed by J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , for which a full angular analysis of the decay products is performed to separate statistically the CP-even and CP-odd contributions in the final state. As already mentioned in Sect. 3.3.2, CDF [197], D0 [198], ATLAS [199,200], CMS [201] and LHCb [202,203] have used both untagged and tagged B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 (and more generally B 0 s \u2192 (cc)K + K \u2212 ) events for the measurement of \u03c6 ccs s .

Instead, our average only takes into account the correlation between \u03c6 ccs s and s . In the recent LHCb B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 analysis [202], the \u03c6 ccs s values are measured for the first time for each polarisation of the final state. Since those values are compatible within each other, we still use the unique value of \u03c6 ccs s for our world average, corresponding to the one measured by the other-than-LHCb analyses. In the same analysis, the statistical correlation coefficient between \u03c6 ccs s and |\u03bb| (which signals CP violation in the decay if different from unity) is measured to be very small (\u22120.02). We neglect this correlation in our average. Furthermore, the statistical correlation coefficient between \u03c6 ccs s and s is measured to be small (\u22120.08). When averaging LHCb results of",

In cases where considerable theoretical input is required to extract the fundamental quantities, no attempt to do so is made. However, straightforward interpretations of the averages are given, where possible. In Sect. 4.1 a brief introduction to the relevant phenomenology is given. In Sect. 4.2 an attempt is made to clarify the various different notations in use. In Sect. 4.3 the common inputs to which experimental results are rescaled in the averaging procedure are listed. We also briefly introduce the treatment of experimental errors. In the remainder of this section, the experimental results and their averages are given, divided into subsections based on the underlying quark-level decays. All the measurements reported are quantities determined from decay-time-dependent analyses, with the exception of several in Sect. 4.14, which are related to the UT angle \u03b3 and are obtained from decay-time-integrated analyses. In the compilations of measurements, indications of the sizes of the data samples used by each experiment are given.

When one of the pair decays into a final state that tags its flavour, the flavour of the other at that instant is known. The evolution of the other neutral B meson is therefore described in terms of t, the difference between the decay times of the two mesons in the pair. At hadron collider experiments, t is usually used in place of t since the flavour tagging is done at production (t = 0); due to the nature of the production in hadron colliders (incoherent bb quark pair production with many additional associated particles), very different methods are used for tagging compared to those in e + e \u2212 experiments.

In this document, only the theoretically cleanest channels are interpreted as measurements of the weak phase (e.g. b \u2192 ccs transitions for sin(2\u03b2)), though even in these cases some care is necessary. In channels in which the second amplitude is expected to be suppressed, the concept of an effective weak phase difference is sometimes used, e.g. sin(2\u03b2 eff ) in b \u2192 qqs transition.",

However, for modes that have contributions from amplitudes with different weak phases, the relative size of these contributions can be different for each helicity (or transversity) amplitude, and therefore the time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters can also differ.

In order to perform unbinned maximum likelihood fits, and thereby extract as much information as possible from the distributions, it is necessary to choose a model for the multiparticle decay, and therefore the results acquire some model dependence. In certain cases, model-independent methods are also possible, but the resulting need to bin the Dalitz plot leads to some loss of statistical precision. The number of observables depends on the final state (and on the model used); the key feature is that as long as there are regions where both CP-even and CP-odd amplitudes contribute, the interference terms will be sensitive to the cosine of the weak phase difference.

The parameter J s2 (and hence J s2 /J 0 ) is predicted to be pos-itive; assuming this prediction to be correct, it is possible to determine the sign of cos(2\u03b2). [258,267] show large contributions from the \u03c1(770) 0 and f 0 (500) states, together with smaller contributions from higher resonances. Since modelling the f 0 (500) structure is challenging [268], it is difficult to determine reliably its associated CP violation parameters. Corresponding parameters for the J/\u03c8\u03c1 0 decay can, however, be determined. In the LHCb analysis [258], 2\u03b2 eff is determined from the fit; results are then converted into values for S CP and C CP to allow comparison with other modes. Here, the notation S CP and C CP denotes parameters obtained for the J/\u03c8\u03c1 0 final state accounting for the composition of CP-even and CP-odd amplitudes (while assuming that all amplitudes involve the same phases), so that no dilution occurs. Possible CP violation effects in the other amplitudes contributing to the Dalitz plot are treated as a source of systematic uncertainty.",

In particular, experiments have studied B + \u2192 DK * (892) + , B 0 \u2192 DK * (892) 0 and B + \u2192 DK + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays.

Their effect on the Q2B analysis can be accounted for with a coherence factor [312], usually denoted \u03ba, which tends to unity in the limit that the K * (892) resonance is the only signal amplitude contributing in the selected region of phase space. In this case, the hadronic parameters r B and \u03b4 B become effectively weighted averages across the selected phase space of the magnitude ratio and relative strong phase between the CKM-suppressed and -favoured amplitudes; these effective parameters are denotedr B and\u03b4 B (the notations r s , \u03b4 s and r S , \u03b4 S are also found in the literature).

Table 27 Results and averages for S b\u2192ccs and C b\u2192ccs . The result marked ( * ) uses \"hadronic and previously unused muonic decays of the J/\u03c8\". We neglect a small possible correlation of this result with the main BaBar result [331]  As explained in Sect. 1, we do not apply a rescaling factor on the error of an average that has \u03c7 2 /dof > 1 (unlike the procedure currently used by the PDG [327]). We provide a confidence level of the fit so that one can know the consistency of the measurements included in the average, and attach comments in case some care needs to be taken in the interpretation. Note that, in general, results obtained from data samples with low statistics will exhibit some non-Gaussian behaviour. We average measurements with asymmetric errors using the PDG [327] prescription. In cases where several measurements are correlated (e.g. S f and C f in measurements of time-dependent CP violation in B decays to a particular CP eigenstate) we take these into account in the averaging procedure if the uncertainties are sufficiently Gaussian. For measurements where one error is given, it represents the total error, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been added in quadrature. If two errors are given, the first is statistical and the second systematic. If more than two errors are given, the origin of the additional uncertainty will be explained in the text.",

In principle, the strong phases between the transversity amplitudes are not uniquely determined by such an analysis, leading to a discrete ambiguity in the sign of cos(2\u03b2). The BaBar collaboration resolves this ambiguity using the known variation [343] of the P-wave phase (fast) relative to the S-wave phase (slow) with the invariant mass of the K \u03c0 system in the vicinity of the K * (892) resonance. The result is in agreement with the prediction from s quark helicity conservation, and corresponds to Solution II defined by Suzuki [344].

The corresponding penguin-type transition proceeds via insertion of a uu pair, which is expected to be favoured over the ss insertion by fragmentation models. Neglecting rescattering, the final state K 0 K 0 K 0 (reconstructed as K 0 S K 0 S K 0 S ) has no tree pollution [367]. Various estimates, using different theoretical approaches, of the values of S = S b\u2192qqs \u2212 S b\u2192ccs exist in the literature [368][369][370][371][372][373][374][375][376][377][378][379][380][381]. In general, there is agreement that the modes \u03c6 K 0 , \u03b7 K 0 and K 0 K 0 K 0 are the cleanest, with values of | S| at or below the few percent level ( S is usually predicted to be positive). Nonetheless, the uncertainty is sufficient that interpretation is given in terms of sin(2\u03b2 eff ). 33 The presence of a small (O(\u03bb 2 )) weak phase in the dominant amplitude of the s penguin decays introduces a phase shift given by S b\u2192qqs = \u2212\u03b7 sin(2\u03b2)(1 + ). Using the CKMfitter results for the Wolfenstein parameters [252], one finds 0.033, which corresponds to a shift of 2\u03b2 of +2.1 \u2022 . Nonperturbative contributions can alter this result. Results from both BaBar and Belle are averaged for the modes \u03b7 K 0 (K 0 indicates that both",

[298] have shown that an inclusive analysis of K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03b3 can be performed, since the properties of the decay amplitudes are independent of the angular momentum of the K 0 S \u03c0 0 system. However, if non-dipole operators contribute significantly to the amplitudes, then the Standard Model mixing-induced CP violation could be larger than the na\u00efve expectation S \u22122(m s /m b ) sin (2\u03b2) [299,300]. In this case, the CP parameters may vary over the K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03b3 Dalitz plot, for example as a function of the K 0 S \u03c0 0 invariant mass.",

In the presence of the penguin contribution, there is no straightforward interpretation of the Q2B observables in the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 system in terms of CKM parameters. However, CP violation in decay may arise, resulting in either or both of C \u03c1\u03c0 = 0 and A \u03c1\u03c0 CP = 0. Equivalently, CP violation in decay may be seen by either of the decay-type-specific observables A +\u2212 \u03c1\u03c0 and A \u2212+ \u03c1\u03c0 , defined in Eq. 132, deviating from zero. Results and averages for these parameters are also given in Table 45. Averages of CP violation parameters in B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays are shown in Fig. 36, both in A \u03c1\u03c0 CP vs. C \u03c1\u03c0 space and in A \u2212+ \u03c1\u03c0 vs. A +\u2212 \u03c1\u03c0 space. The averages for S b\u2192u\u016bd and C b\u2192u\u016bd in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays are both more than 5\u03c3 away from zero, suggesting that both mixing-induced and CP violation in decay are well-established in this channel. The discrepancy between Footnote 35 continued B 0 \u2192 a \u00b1 1 \u03c0 \u2213 case there has not yet been a full amplitude analysis of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and therefore only the Q2B parameters are available.   results from BaBar and Belle that used to exist in this channel (see, for example, Ref. [420]) is no longer apparent, and the results from LHCb are also fully consistent with other measurements. Some difference is, however, seen between the BaBar and Belle measurements in the a \u00b1 1 \u03c0 \u2213 system. The confidence level of the five-dimensional aver-age is 0.03, which corresponds to a 2.1\u03c3 discrepancy. As seen in Table 44, this discrepancy is primarily in the values of S a 1 \u03c0 , and is not evident in the A \u2212+ a 1 \u03c0 vs. A +\u2212 a 1 \u03c0 projection shown in Fig. 32. Since there is no evidence of systematic problems in either analysis, we do not rescale the errors of the averages. ",

As described in Sect. 4.2.6, the averages are given in terms of the parameters a and c of Eq. (136). CP violation would appear as a = 0. Results are available from both BaBar and Belle in the modes D \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 and D * \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 ; for the latter mode both experiments have used both full and partial reconstruction techniques.

For each mode, D\u03c0 , D * \u03c0 and D\u03c1, there are two measurements (a and c, or S + and S \u2212 ) that depend on three unknowns (R, \u03b4 and 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 ), of which two are different for each decay mode. Therefore, there is not enough information to solve directly for 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 . However, for each choice of R and 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 , one can find the value of \u03b4 that allows a and c to be closest to their measured values, and calculate the separation in terms of numbers of standard deviations. (We currently neglect experimental correlations in this analysis.) These values of N (\u03c3 ) min can then be displayed as a function of R and 2\u03b2 +\u03b3 (and can trivially be converted to confidence levels). These plots are given for the D\u03c0 and D * \u03c0 modes in Fig. 38; the uncertainties in the D\u03c1 mode are currently too large to give any meaningful constraint.",

The BaBar taggedB \u2192 D * 2 \u2212\u03bd has been measured selecting D * s \u2192 D\u03c0 final state and it has been translated in a result on [327]. Figures 54  and 55 show the measurements and the resulting averages.       The semileptonic decay width (B \u2192 X c \u2212\u03bd ) has been calculated in the framework of the operator production expansion (OPE) [55][56][57]. The result is a double-expansion in \u039b QCD /m b and \u03b1 s , which depends on a number of non-perturbative parameters. These parameters describe the dynamics of the b-quark inside the B hadron and can be measured using observables inB \u2192 X c \u2212\u03bd decays, such as the moments of the lepton energy and the hadronic mass spectrum. Two renormalization schemes are commonly used to defined the b-quark mass and other theoretical quantities: the kinetic [504][505][506][507]  . Note that the numerical values of the kinetic and 1S b-quark masses cannot be compared without converting one or the other, or both, to the same renormalization scheme.",

Reconstruction-related uncertainties are taken as fully correlated within a given experiment. Measurements of partial branching fractions for B \u2192 X u + \u03bd transitions from \u03a5 (4S) decays, together with the corresponding selected region, are given in Table 89. The signal yields for all the measurements shown in Table 89 are not rescaled to common input values of the B meson lifetime (see Sect. 3) and the semileptonic width [327]. We use all results published by BaBar in Ref. [546], since the statistical correlations are given. To make use of the theoretical calculations of Ref. [547], we restrict the kinematic range of the invariant mass of the hadronic system, M X , and the square of the invariant mass of the lepton pair, q 2 . This reduces the size of the data sample significantly, but also the theoretical uncertainty, as stated by the authors [547]. The dependence of the quoted error on the measured value for each source of uncertainty is taken into account in the calculation of the averages. It has been first suggested by Neubert [548] and later detailed by Leibovich, Low, and Rothstein (LLR) [549] and Lange, Neubert and Paz (LNP) [550], that the uncertainty of the leading shape functions can be eliminated by comparing inclusive rates for B \u2192 X u + \u03bd decays with the inclusive photon spectrum in B \u2192 X s \u03b3 , based on the assumption that    the shape functions for transitions to light quarks, u or s, are the same at first order. However, shape function uncertainties are only eliminated at the leading order and they still enter via the signal models used for the determination of efficiency. ",

BLNP assign uncertainties to the b-quark mass, which enters through the leading shape function, to sub-leading shape function forms, to possible weak annihilation contribution, and to matching scales. The BLNP calculation uses the shape function renormalization scheme; the heavy quark parameters determined from the global fit in the kinetic scheme, described in Sect. 5.2.2, were therefore translated into the shape function scheme by using a prescription by Neubert [563,564]. The resulting parameters are m b (SF) = (4.582 \u00b1 0.023 \u00b1 0.018) GeV, \u03bc 2 \u03c0 (SF) = (0.202 \u00b1 0.089 +0.020 \u22120.040 ) GeV/c 2 , where the second uncertainty is due to the scheme translation.

The normalized triple differential decay rate for B \u2192 X u + \u03bd [566,[569][570][571] is calculated with a model based on (i) soft-gluon resummation to next-to-next-leading order and (ii) an effective QCD coupling without Landau pole. This coupling is constructed by means of an extrapola-    tion to low energy of the high-energy behaviour of the standard coupling. More technically, an analyticity principle is used.

Understanding the rate of charm production in b-hadron decays is crucial to validate the HQE that underpins much of the theoretical framework for b physics (see, for example, Ref. [586] for a review). Moreover, such decays are often used as normalization modes for measurements of rarer decays. In addition, they are the dominant background in many analyses. To model accurately such backgrounds with simulated data, it is essential to have precise knowledge of the contributing decay modes. In particular, with the expected increase in the data samples at LHCb and Belle II, the enhanced statistical sensitivity has to be matched by low systematic uncertainties due to knowledge of the dominant b-hadron decay modes. For multibody decays, knowledge of the distribution of decays across the phase-space (e.g., the Dalitz plot density for threebody decays or the polarization amplitudes for vector-vector final states) is required in addition to the total branching fraction.",

In some cases where the decay is not flavour-specific and the final state is not selfconjugate, the inclusion of the conjugate final state neutral kaon is implied -in fact, the flavour of the neutral kaon is never determined experimentally, and so the specification as K 0 or K 0 simply follows the quark model expectation for the dominant decay. An exception occurs for some B 0 s decays, specifically those to CP eigenstates, where the width difference between the mass eigenstates (see Sect. 3) means that the measured branching fraction, integrated over decay time, is specific to the studied final state [592]. Therefore it is appropriate to quote the branching fraction for, e.g., B",

These measurements require knowledge of the production rates ofB 0 s mesons, usually measured relative to those ofB 0 and B \u2212 mesons, in the appropriate experimental environment. Since these production fractions are reasonably well known, see Sect. 3.1, they can be corrected for allowing the results to be presented in  terms of the absoluteB 0 s branching fraction, or the relative branching fraction to a lighter B meson decay mode. This is usually done in the publications; we do not make any attempt to rescale results according to more recent determinations of the relative production fractions. Ratios of branching fractions of two decays of the same hadron do not require any such correction.",

This definition is consistent with that of Eq. 104 Most of the branching fractions from BaBar and Belle assume equal production of charged and neutral B pairs. The best measurements to date show that this is still a reasonable approximation (see Sect. 3). For branching fractions, we provide either averages or the most stringent upper limits. If one or more experiments have measurements with > 4\u03c3 for a decay channel, all available central values for that channel are used in the averaging. We also give central values and errors for cases where the significance of the average value is at least 3\u03c3 , even if no single measurement is above 4\u03c3 . For A CP we provide averages in all cases. At the end of some of the tables we give a list of results that were not included. Typical cases are the measurements of distributions, such as differential branching fractions or longitudinal polarizations, which are measured in different binning schemes by the different collaborations, and thus cannot be directly used to obtain averages.",

The measurements of B 0 s decays are particularly noteworthy. Sections 7.1 and 7.2 provide compilations of branching fractions of B 0 and B + to mesonic and baryonic charmless final states, respectively, while Sect. 7.3 gives branching fractions of b-baryon decays. In Sects. 7.4 and 7.5 various observables of interest are given in addition to branching fractions: in the former, branching fractions of B 0 s -meson charmless decays, and in the latter observables related to leptonic and radiative B 0 and B + meson decays, including processes in which the photon yields a pair of charged or neutral leptons. Section 7.5 also reports limits from searches for lepton-flavor/number-violating decays. Sections 7.6 and 7.7 give CP asymmetries and results of polarization measurements, respectively, in various b-hadron charmless decays.

It results from interference between two different decay amplitudes (e.g., a penguin and tree amplitude)  that have different weak (CKM) and strong phases. 40 In the Standard Model a difference in strong phases may arise for example due to final-state interactions (FSI) [1097], different 40   a percent level.

            "text": "Different techniques by several experiments are used to measure D meson semileptonic decays having a pseudoscalar particle in the final state. The most recent results are provided by the BaBar [1168] and BES III [1169,1170] collaborations. Belle [1171], BaBar [1172], and CLEOc [1173,1174] have all previously reported results. Belle fully reconstructs e + e \u2212 \u2192 DD X events from the continuum under the \u03a5 (4S) resonance, achieving very good q 2 resolution (15 MeV 2 ) and a low background level but with a low efficiency. Using 282 fb \u22121 of data, about 1300 and 115 signal semileptonic decays are isolated for both lepton channels together (e + \u03bc), for the Cabibbo-favored and Cabibbosuppressed modes, respectively. The BaBar experiment uses a partial reconstruction technique in which the semileptonic decays are tagged via D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays. The D direction and neutrino energy are obtained using information from the rest of the event. With 75 fb \u22121 of data, 74,000 signal events in the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd mode are obtained. This technique provides a large signal yield but also a high background level and a poor q 2 resolution (ranging from 66 to 219 MeV 2 ). In this case the measurement of the branching fraction is obtained by normalizing to the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay channel; thus the measurement would benefit from future improvements in the determination of this reference channel. The Cabibbo-suppressed mode has been recently measured using the same technique and 350 fb \u22121 data. For this measurement, 5000 D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd signal events were reconstructed [1168]. The CLEO-c experiment uses two different methods to measure charm semileptonic decays. Tagged analyses [1173] rely on the full reconstruction of (3770) \u2192 D D events. One of the D mesons is reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode, the other in the semileptonic channel. The only missing particle is the neutrino so the q 2 resolution is very good and the background level very low. With the entire CLEO-c data sample, 818 pb \u22121 , 14,123 and 1374 signal events are reconstructed for the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd channels, and 8467 and 838 for the D + \u2192 K 0 e + \u03bd and D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd decays, respectively. Another technique without tagging the D meson in a hadronic mode (\"untagged\" in the following) has been also used by CLEO-c [1174]. In this method, the entire missing energy and momentum in an event are associated with the neutrino four momentum, with the penalty of larger background as compared to the tagged method. Using the \"tagged\" method the BES III experiment measures the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd decay channels. With 2.9 fb \u22121 they fully reconstruct 70,700 and 6300 signal events for each channel, respectively [1169]. In a sep-arated analysis the BES III experiment measures also the D + decay mode into D + \u2192 K 0 L e + \u03bd [1170]. Using several tagged hadronic events they reconstruct 20,100 semileptonic candidates.",

With four particles emitted in the final state, the differential decay rate depends on five variables. In addition to the four variables defined in previous sections there is also m 2 , the mass squared of the  charm mesons.

For the S-wave amplitude, considering what was measured in D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays, a polynomial variation below the K * 0 (1430) and a Breit-Wigner distribution, above are assumed.

It is verified that the variation of the S-wave phase is compatible with expectations from elastic K \u03c0 [343,1194] (after correcting for \u03b4 3/2 ) according to the Watson theorem.

For this comparison, the plotted values from BaBar for the two distributions are fixed to 1 at q 2 = 0. The different behavior of h 0 (q 2 ) and H 0 (q 2 ) can be explained by their different dependence in the p * variable. Table 280 lists measurements of r V and r 2 from several experiments. Most of the measurements assume that the q 2 dependence of hadronic form factors is given by the simple pole ansatz.

At these precisions, Final State Radiation (FSR) must be treated correctly and consistently across the input measurements for the accuracy of the averages to match the precision. The sensitivity of measurements to FSR arises because of a tail in the distribution of radiated energy that extends to the kinematic limit. The tail beyond E \u03b3 \u2248 30 MeV causes typical selection variables like the hadronic invariant mass to shift outside the selection range dictated by experimental resolution, as shown in Fig. 209. While the differential rate for the tail is small, the integrated rate amounts to several percent of the total h + h \u2212 (n\u03b3 ) rate because of the tail's extent. The tail therefore trans-   [1210][1211][1212][1213] within the experiment's Monte Carlo simulation. PHOTOS itself, however, has evolved, over the period spanning the set of measurements. In particular, the incorporation of interference between radiation off the two separate mesons has proceeded in stages: it was first available for particle-antiparticle pairs in version 2.00 (1993), extended to any two-body, all-charged, final states in version 2.02 (1999), and further extended to multi-body final states in version 2. 15 (2005). The effects of interference are clearly visible, as shown in Fig. 209, and cause a roughly 30% increase in the integrated rate into the high energy photon tail. To evaluate the FSR correction incorporated into a given measurement, we must therefore note whether any correction was made, the version of PHOTOS used in correction, and whether the interference terms in PHOTOS were turned on.",

In the remainder of the analyses, the relevant quantity was the reconstructed hadronic two-body mass m h + h \u2212 . To make the correction, we only need to evaluate the fraction of decays that FSR moves outside of the range accepted for the analysis. The corrections were evaluated using an event generator (EvtGen [1214]) that incorporates PHOTOS to simulate the portions of the decay process most relevant to the correction. We compared corrections determined both with and without smearing to account for experimental resolution. The differences were negligible, typically of O(1%) of the correction itself. The immunity of the correction to resolution effects comes about because most of the long FSR-induced tail in, for example, the m h + h \u2212 distribution resides well away from the selection boundaries.

These corrections tend to cancel in the branching ratios, leading to corrections of 1.031 \u00b1 0.001 for B( Table 286 summarizes the corrected branching fractions. The published FSR-related modeling uncertainties have been replaced by with a new, common, estimate based on the assumption that the dominant uncertainty in the FSR corrections comes from the fact that the mesons are treated like structureless particles. No contributions from structuredependent terms in the decay process (e.g., radiation off individual quarks) are included in PHOTOS. Internal studies done by various experiments have indicated that in K \u03c0 decays, the PHOTOS corrections agree with data at the 20-    30% level. We therefore attribute a 25% uncertainty to the FSR prediction from potential structure-dependent contributions. For the other two modes, the only difference in structure is the final state valence quark content. While radiative corrections typically come in with a 1/M dependence, one would expect the additional contribution from the structure terms to come in on time scales shorter than the hadronization time scale. In this case, you might expect \u039b QCD to be the relevant scale, rather than the quark masses, and therefore that the amplitude is the same for the three modes. In treating the correlations among the measurements this is what we assume. We also assume that the PHOTOS amplitudes and any missing structure amplitudes are relatively real with constructive interference. The uncertainties largely cancel in the branching fraction ratios. For the final average branching fractions, the FSR uncertainty on K \u03c0 dominates. Note that because of the relative sizes of FSR in the different modes, the \u03c0\u03c0/K \u03c0 branching ratio uncertainty from FSR is positively correlated with that for the K \u03c0 branching fraction, while the K K /K \u03c0 branching ratio FSR uncertainty is negatively correlated.",

With the estimated uncertainty in the FSR modeling used here, the FSR uncertainty dominates the statistical uncertainty in the average, suggesting that experimental work in the near future should focus on verification of FSR with E \u03b3 100 MeV. Note that the systematic uncertainty excluding FSR is still larger than the FSR uncertainty; in the most precise measurements of these branching fractions, the largest systematic uncertainty is the uncertainty on the tracking efficiency. The B(D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) and B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) measurements inferred from the branching ratio measurements also agree well (Fig. 212). The B(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) average obtained here is approximately two statistical standard deviations higher than the 2016 PDG update average [6]. Table 288 shows the evolution from a fit similar to the PDG's (no FSR corrections or correlations, reference [1223] included) to the average presented here. There are two main contributions to the difference. The branching fraction in reference [1223] is low, and its exclusion shifts the result upwards. The dominant shift (+0.017%) is due to the FSR corrections, which as expected shift the result upwards.",

Dalitz plot analyses of B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0\u03c0 decays strongly favor the assignments 0 + and 1 + for the spinparity quantum numbers of the D * 0 (2400) 0 /D * 0 (2400) \u00b1 and D 1 (2430) 0 states, respectively. The measured masses and widths, as well as the J P values, are in agreement with theoretical predictions based on potential models [496,[1229][1230][1231]. Tables 292 and 293 summarize the branching fractions of B meson decays to excited D and D s states, respectively. It is notable that the branching fractions for B mesons decaying to a narrow D * * state and a pion are similar for charged and neutral B initial states, while the branching fractions to a broad D * * state and \u03c0 + are much larger for B + than for B 0 . This may be due to the fact that color-suppressed amplitudes contribute only to the B + decay and not to the B 0 decay (for a theoretical discussion, see Refs. [1232,1233]  [1234] for a discussion of cs models). Moreover, the mass splitting between these two states greatly exceeds that between the D s1 (2536) \u00b1 and D s2 (2573) \u00b1 . These unexpected properties have led to interpretations of the D * s0 (2317) \u00b1 and D s1 (2460) \u00b1 as exotic four-quark states [1235,1236].",

An LHCb study of B 0 s \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays, in which they searched for excited D s mesons [1240], showed with 10\u03c3 significance that this state is comprised of two different particles, one of spin 1 and one of spin 3. This represents the first measurement of a heavy flavored spin-3 particle, and the first observation of B meson decays to spin 3 particles. A subsequent study of D s J mesons by the LHCb collaboration [1241] supports the natural parity assignment for this state (J P = 3 \u2212 ). This study also shows weak evidence for a further structure at a mass around 3040 MeV/c 2 with unnatural parity, which was first hinted at by a BaBar analysis [1238]. ",

            "text": "Other observed excited D s states include D * s1 (2700) \u00b1 and D * s2 (2573) \u00b1 . The properties of both (mass, width, J P ) have been measured and determined in several analyses. A theoretical discussion [1242]         baryon decays was scarce until 2014, when Belle published the first model-independent measurement of the branching fraction for \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + [1271]. This measurement improved upon the precision of previous (model-dependent) measurements by a factor of five. Since then the precision of other \u039b + c branching fractions has improved due to measurements based on threshold data performed by BESIII [531]. BESIII also reported the first measurement of the branching fraction for the semileptonic decay \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e [1272]. Here we present a global fit for branching fractions of Cabbibo-favored \u039b + c decays, taking into account all relevant experimental measurements and their correlations. All measurements used assume unpolarised production of the \u039b + c . The measurements listed in Table 296 are input to a leastsquares fit minimizing a \u03c7 2 statistic. The fitted quantities are the \u039b + c branching fractions for twelve hadronic modes and one semileptonic mode. The measurements are labelled using the n notation employed by the Particle Data Group [6], where n is an integer that specifies the decay mode. The fitted output consists of 13 quantities -twelve hadronic and one semileptonic branching fraction. The advantage of our fit is that it takes into account correlations among measurements from the same experiment, i.e., systematic uncertainties related to normalization, track-finding efficiency, particle identification efficiency, and \u03c0 0 , K 0 S , and \u039b reconstruction efficiencies. For the twelve hadronic branching fractions   [1282] measured by BESIII, we use BESIII's published correlation matrix [531]. The resulting fitted values for the branching fractions are given in Table 296. The overall \u03c7 2 of the fit is 30.0 for 23 degrees of freedom, which corresponds to a p value of 0.149. The correlation matrix for the fitted branching fractions is shown in Fig. 214, and constraints from individual measurements for pairs of fitted branching fractions are shown in Fig. 215. The branching fraction of the normalisation decay \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + is found to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (6.46 \u00b1 0.24)%.  ",

Should these values change, so will some of the values for the masses of the excited states. Table 297 summarizes the excited \u039b + c baryons. The first two states listed, namely the \u039b c (2595) + and \u039b c (2625) + , are well-established. The measured masses and decay patterns suggest that they are orbitally excited \u039b + c baryons with total angular momentum of the light quarks L = 1. Thus their quantum numbers are assigned to be J P = ( 1 2 ) \u2212 and J P = (   showing the one-dimensional errors. In cases where multiple ratio measurements exists ( i / j ), only the most precise one is plotted  and 0 c baryon families. For the first four iso-doublets, the mass difference with respect to the ground state is given, as the uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in the ground state mass. In the remaining cases, the uncertainty on the measurement of the excited state itself dominates Natural width (MeV)  Table 298 summarizes the excited ++,+,0 c baryons. The ground iso-triplets of c (2455) ++,+,0 and c (2520) ++,+,0 baryons are well-established. Belle [1289]precisely measured the mass differences and widths of the doubly charged and neutral members of this triplet. The short list of excited c baryons is completed by the triplet of c (2800) states observed by Belle [1290]. Based on the measured masses and theoretical predictions [1291,1292], these states are assumed to be members of the predicted c2 3/2 \u2212 triplet. From a study of resonant substructure in B \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + cp \u03c0 \u2212 decays, BaBar found a significant signal in the \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212 final state with a mean value higher than measured for the c (2800) by Belle by about 3\u03c3 ( Table 298). The decay widths measured by Belle and BaBar are consistent, but it is an open question if the observed state is the same as the Belle state. Table 299 summarizes the excited \u039e +,0 c and 0 c baryons. The list of excited \u039e c baryons has several states, of unknown quantum numbers, having masses above 2900 MeV/c 2 and decaying into three different types of decay modes: \u039b c / c n\u03c0 , \u039e c n\u03c0 and the most recently observed \u039bD. Some of these states (\u039e c (2970) + , \u039e c (3055) and \u039e c (3080) +,0 ) have been observed by both Belle [1293][1294][1295] and BaBar [694] and are considered well-established. The \u039e c (2930) 0 state decaying into \u039b + c K \u2212 is seen only by BaBar [1296] and needs confirmation. The \u039e c (3123) + observed by BaBar [694] in the c (2520) ++ \u03c0 \u2212 final state has not been confirmed by Belle [1294] with twice the statistics; thus its existence in doubt and it is omitted from Table 299.",

We focus on the averages that benefit most from the adoption of the HFLAV methodology [420], namely a global fit of the \u03c4 branching fractions that best exploits the available experimental information. Since the 2016 edition, the HFLAV-Tau group has collaborated to the determination of the \u03c4 -lepton branching fractions based on a global fit and to the related mini-review that are included in the \"Review of particle physics\" [6]. The differences between the PDG 2016 fit and the fit presented here are detailed in Sect. 9.1.4.

Some fitted quantities are equal to the ratio of two other fitted quantities, as documented with the notation i / j in Table 304. Some fitted quantities are sums of other fitted quantities, for instance 8 = B(\u03c4 \u2192 h \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 ) is the sum of 9 = B(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 ) and 10 = B(\u03c4 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 ). The symbol h is used to mean either a \u03c0 or K . Section 9.1.7 lists all equations relating one quantity to the sum of other quantities. In the following, we refer to both types of relations between fitted quantities collectively as constraint equations or constraints. The fit \u03c7 2 is minimized subject to all the above mentioned constraints, listed in Table 304 and Sect. 9.1.7.

The constraint equations include as coefficients the values of some non-tau branching fractions, denoted e.g., with the self-describing notation K S \u2192\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . Some coefficients are probabilities corresponding to modulus square amplitudes describing quantum mixtures of states such as K 0 ,K 0 , K S , K L , denoted with e.g., <K 0 |K S > = |<K 0 |K S >| 2 . All nontau quantities are taken from the PDG 2015 [327] fits (when available) or averages, and are used without accounting for    their uncertainties, which are however in general small with respect to the uncertainties on the \u03c4 branching fractions. The following list does not include the constraints listed in Table 304, where some measured ratios of branching fractions are expressed as ratios of two branching fractions.    Lepton universality tests probe the Standard Model prediction that the charged weak current interaction has the same coupling for all lepton generations. The precision of such tests has been significantly improved since the 2014 edition by the addition of the Belle \u03c4 lifetime measurement [1402], while improvements from the \u03c4 branching fraction fit are negligible. We compute the universality tests as in the previous report by using ratios of the partial widths of a heavier lepton \u03bb decaying to a lighter lepton \u03c1 [1403],  [327]. We use HFLAV Spring 2017 averages and PDG 2015 for the other quantities. Using pure leptonic processes we obtain g \u03c4 g \u03bc = 1.0010 \u00b1 0.0015, g \u03c4 g e = 1.0029 \u00b1 0.0015, g \u03bc g e = 1.0019 \u00b1 0.0014.",

In past determinations of |V us |, for example in the 2009 HFLAV report [420], the total hadronic branching fraction has been computed using unitarity as B uni had = 1 \u2212 B e \u2212 B \u03bc , obtaining then B s from the sum of the strange branching fractions and B VA from B uni had \u2212 B s . We prefer to use the more direct experimental determination of B VA for two reasons. First, both methods result in comparable uncertainties on |V us |, since the better precision on B uni had = 1 \u2212 B e \u2212 B \u03bc is vanified by increased statistical correlations in the expressions (1 \u2212 B e \u2212 B \u03bc )/B univ e and B s /(B had \u2212 B s ) in the |V us | calculation. Second, if there are unobserved \u03c4 hadronic decay modes, they would affect B VA and B s in a more asymmetric way when using unitarity.",

This determination uses inputs that are partially different from the ones used in this report.

The discriminating variables x i j are assumed to be uncorrelated. The expected signal s i is related to the \u03c4 lepton branching fraction B(\u03c4 \u2192 f i ) into the searched final state f i by s i = N i i B(\u03c4 \u2192 f i ), where N i is the number of produced \u03c4 leptons and i is the detection efficiency for observing the decay \u03c4 \u2192 f i . For e + e \u2212 experiments, N i = 2L i \u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c4 , where L i is the integrated luminosity and \u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c4 is the \u03c4 pair production cross section \u03c3 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) [1444]. In experiments where \u03c4 leptons are produced in more complex multiple reactions, the effective N i is typically estimated with Monte Carlo simulations calibrated with related data yields. The extraction of the upper limits is performed using the code provided by Tom Junk [1445]. The systematic uncertainties are modeled in the Monte Carlo toy experiments by convolving the S i and B i PDFs with Gaussian distributions corresponding to the nuisance parameters. Table 318 reports the HFLAV combinations of the \u03c4 LFV limits. Since there is negligible gain in combining limits of very different strength, the combinations do not include the CLEO searches and do not include results where the single event sensitivity is more than a factor of 5 lower than the value for the search with the best limit. Figure 222 reports a graphical representation of the limits in Table 318. The published information that has been used to obtain these limits is reported in Table 319. Fig. 222 Tau lepton-flavour-violating branching fraction upper limits combinations summary plot. For each channel we report the HFLAV combined limit, and the experimental published limits. In some cases, the combined limit is weaker than the limit published by a single experiment. This arises since the CL s method used in the combination can be more conservative compared to other legitimate methods, especially when the number of observed events fluctuates below the expected background ",

A sizable value of the decay width difference in the B 0 s \u2212B 0 s system is measured with a relative precision of 7% and is well predicted by the Standard Model (SM). In contrast, the experimental results for the decay width difference in the B 0 \u2212B 0 system are not yet precise enough to distinguish the small (expected) value from zero. The mass differences in both systems are known very accurately, to the (few) per mil level. On the other hand, CP violation in the mixing of either system has not been observed yet, with asymmetries known within a couple per mil but still consistent both with zero and their SM predictions. A similar conclusion holds for the CP violation induced by B 0 s mixing in the b \u2192 ccs transition, although in this case the experimental precision on the corresponding weak phase is an order of magnitude larger, but now becoming just smaller than the SM central value. Many measurements are still dominated by statistical uncertainties and will improve once new results from the LHC Run 2 become available.",

Recently, CMS and LHCb published a combined analysis that allowed the first observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay to be obtained, and provided three standard deviations evidence of the B 0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay.

LHCb has produced many other results on a wide variety of decays, including b-baryon and B + c -meson decays. Belle and BaBar continue to produce new results though their output rates are dwindling.

The mixing parameters x and y individually differ from zero by 1.9\u03c3 and 9.4\u03c3 , respectively.

The averaged R(D) and R(D * ) exceed the SM predictions by 2.2\u03c3 and 3.4\u03c3 respectively. Considering the R(D) and R(D * ) total correlation of \u22120.23, the difference with respect to the SM is about 3.9 \u03c3 , the combined \u03c7 2 = 18.83 for 2 degrees of freedom corresponds to a p-value of 8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , assuming Gaussian error distributions. Decays of b-hadrons into open or hidden charm hadrons Ground state B mesons and b baryons dominantly decay to particles containing a charm quark via the b \u2192 c quark transition. In this section, measurements of such decays to hadronic final states are considered; semileptonic decay modes, which are usually used to determine the strength of the b \u2192 c transition as quantified in the magnitude of the CKM matrix element |V cb |, are discussed in Sect. 5. Some B meson decays to open or hidden charm hadrons that are fundamental for the measurements of CP-violation phases -like \u03c6 ccs s (Sect. 3), \u03b2 \u2261 \u03c6 1 and \u03b3 \u2261 \u03c6 3 (Sect. 4) -are discussed elsewhere in this report. Similarly, the use of b \u2192 c decay modes for the determination of important properties of b-hadrons, like their masses or (absolute, relative or effective) lifetimes, is discussed in Sect. 3. The properties of certain b hadron decays to open or hidden charm hadrons, such as small Q values and similar topologies for different modes, allow the minimization of systematic uncertainties in these measurements.",

Their mass measurements are dominated by CDF[1285]: M(\u039b c (2595) + ) = (2592.25 \u00b1 0.24 \u00b1 0.14) MeV/c 2 and M(\u039b c (2625) + ) = (2628.11 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.14) MeV/c 2 . Earlier measurements did not fully take into account the restricted phase-space of the \u039b c (2595) + decays.The next two states, \u039b c (2765) + and \u039b c (2880) + , were discovered by CLEO[1286] in the \u039b + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state. CLEO found that a significant fraction of the \u039b c (2880) + decays proceeds via an intermediate c (2445) ++/0 \u03c0 \u2212/+ . Later, BaBar[1287] observed that this state has also a D 0 p decay mode. This was the first example of an excited charmed baryon decaying into a charm meson plus a baryon; previously all excited charmed baryon were found in their hadronic transitions into lower lying charmed baryons. In the same analysis, BaBarobserved for the first time an additional state, \u039b c (2940) + , decaying into D 0 p. Studying the D + p final state, BaBar found no signal; this implies that the \u039b c (2880) + and \u039b c (2940) + are \u039b + c excited states rather than c excitations. Belle reported the result of an angular analysis that favors 5/2 for the \u039b c (2880) + spin hypothesis. Moreover, the measured ratio of branching fractions B(\u039b c (2880) + \u2192 c (2520)\u03c0 \u00b1 )/B(\u039b c (2880) + \u2192 c (2455)\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = (0.225 \u00b1 0.062 \u00b1 0.025), combined with theoretical predictions based on HQS[496,1288], favor even parity. However this prediction is only valid if the P-wave portion of c (2520)\u03c0 is suppressed. The current open questions in the excited \u039b + c family include the determination of quantum numbers for the other states, and the nature of the \u039b c (2765) + state, in particular whether it is an excited + c or \u039b + c . However, there is no doubt that the state exists, as it is clearly visible in Belle data.",

The success of these experiments in turn would not have been possible without the excellent operations of the BEPC, CESR, KEKB, LHC, PEP-II, and Tevatron accelerators. We also recognise the interplay between theoretical and experimental communities that has provided a stimulus for many of the measurements in this document. Our averages and this compilation have benefitted greatly from contributions to the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group from numerous individuals. We thank David Kirkby, Yoshihide Sakai, Simon Eidelman, Soeren Prell, and Gianluca Cavoto for their past leadership of HFLAV. We are grateful to Paolo Gambino and Bob Kowalewski for assistance with averages that appear in Sect. 5; to Ruslan Chistov, Lawrence Gibbons, Bostjan Golob, Milind Purohit, and Patrick Roudeau for significant contributions to Sect. 8; and to Michel Davier for providing valuable input to Sect. 9.
