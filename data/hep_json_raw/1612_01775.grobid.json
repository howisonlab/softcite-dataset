About 10 6 -10 8 hyperons, i.e., \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, and \u2126, will be produced in the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays with the proposed data samples at BESIII. Based on these samples, the measurement sensitivity of the branching fractions of the hyperon decays is in the range of 10 \u22125 -10 \u22128 . In addition, with the known center-of-mass energy and \"tag technique,\" rare decays and decays with invisible final states can be probed.",

Even with the designed luminosity of the BEPCII, \u223c10 10 J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) events can be collected with a running period of one year. The inclusive hyperon production rate can reach a few percent in the J/\u03c8 decays, while the hyperon-pair production rate is \u223c10 \u22123 . With these data, the decay properties of the spin-1/2 baryon octet can be revisited and the decay parameters with the coherent production of hyperon pairs in J/\u03c8 \u2192 BB decays (where the spin-1/2 hyperon pairs are in the 1 \u2212\u2212 state) can be probed. This survey will focus on hyperon decays that can be studied at BESIII and rare decays, for which the search has not yet begun.",

The semileptonic hyperon decays provide essential information on the structures of the nucleon and low-lying hyperons. The data for the semileptonic hyperon decays reveal experimentally the pattern of flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking [13]. In exact flavor SU(3) symmetry, the ratios of the axial-vector and vector constants g 1 /f 1 are expressed only by the two constants F and D. Similarly, those of the vector constants f 2 /f 1 are written in terms of the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron with flavor SU(3) symmetry assumed [9]. Details of the semileptonic hyperon decay constants can be found in a review paper [9], and recent developments are described elsewhere [14][15][16][17][18]. However, the experimental data for the semileptonic hyperon decays show that the flavor SU(3) symmetry may be manifestly broken [14], and further precision data are needed, especially for the decays of \u039e 0 , \u039e \u2212 , and \u2126 \u2212 as listed in Table IV. The current measured values for the form-factor ratio g 1 (0)/f 1 (0) in the Cabibbo model [19] are also listed in Table IV.",

As the lepton pairs (e \u2212\u03bd e ) are too soft to be detected by the BESIII detector, to study \u03a3 \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 0 e \u2212\u03bd e in the J/\u03c8 \u2192\u039b\u03a3 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay ,\u039b\u03c0 + can be fully reconstructed as the \"tag side\", following an examination of the recoiling mass of the\u039b\u03c0 + to clearly define the \u03a3 \u2212 signal region; therefore, one can finally reconstruct a \u03a3 0 in the rest of the event to represent the \u03a3 \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 0 e \u2212\u03bd e signal; namely, the lepton pairs can be missed and reconstructed by examining the tagged signals. To study \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039e 0 e \u2212\u03bd e in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u039e \u2212\u039e+ decay, one can reconstruct th\u0113 \u039e + with\u039e + \u2192\u039b\u03c0 + decay as a \"tag\", then look at the \u039e \u2212 signal on the recoiling mass of the fully reconstructed\u039e + , and finally reconstruct a \u039e 0 (with a \u039e 0 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 0 mode) to represent the signals. All these analyses will be benefit from the well-known center-of-mass energy of the initial e + e \u2212 collision at BESIII/BEPCII. The expected sensitivity on the branching fractions will be in the range of 10 \u22125 -10 \u22126 .

The situation was further confounded by a number of theoretical calculations that violated Hara's theorem (even) in the SU(3) limit [21].

The current data were all from the fixed target experiments more than a few decades ago, and improved or cross-checked measurements should be done in the future.

In addition to the two-body radiative decays, weak hyperon dilepton decays will provide additional information on the radiative transitions [28,29] .

In the SM, the leading short-distance contribution comes from an FCNC interaction, which is allowed only at loop level [32]. As discussed in Section IV, the decays of B i \u2192 B f e + e \u2212 play an important role in helping us to understand the dynamics of radiative hyperon decays, and the decay rates are suppressed by two orders of magnitudes if we assume an inner bremsstrahlung-like mechanism producing the e + e \u2212 pairs [31]. For the decay B i \u2192 B f \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , the process is dominated by long-distance contributions, which are from the B i \u2192 B f \u03b3 * and B i \u2192 B f V * (where V could be \u03c1/\u03c9 vector mesons) processes, namely, the so-called vector dominant model mechanism [24]. For example, the branching fraction of \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is predicted to be B(\u03a3 + \u2192 p\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) \u2208 [1.6, 9.0] \u00d7 10 \u22128 [32] by considering the long-distance contributions, while the short-distance SM contributions are suppressed at a branching fraction of \u223c10 \u221212 . Dalitz decays of hyperons are of particular interest, as they also allow a direct search for a new scalar or vector particle, which could lead to an s \u2192 d transition at the tree level [33]. Recently, the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment (LHCb) searched for \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay and observed an excess of events with respect to the background expectations with a signal significance of 4.0 standard deviations. No significant structure is observed in the dimuon invariant mass distribution. Owing to the difficulty of normalization in the absence of signal, only an upper limit on the branching fraction is set to be 6.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 95% C.L. [34], which agrees with the SM prediction [32], whereas the sensitivities for the decays B i \u2192 B f l + l \u2212 are estimated to be 10 \u22126 -10 \u22127 as listed in Table VII (Type A) with the BESIII data. Rare and forbidden hyperon decays and expected sensitivities with 10 10 events on the J/\u03c8 peak and 3 \u00d7 10 9 events on the \u03c8(2S) peak. Type A decay modes are through a photon-penguin-like weak neutral current; Type B decay modes are through a Z-penguin-like weak neutral current; Type C decay modes are neutrinoless double \u03b2 decays, which violate lepton number. The current data are from the world average in PDG2016 [3]. \"-\" indicates \"not available.\"",

Bi \u2192 B f \u03bd\u03bd decays via a Z-type penguin Analogous to the rare K \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03bd decays [40], the rare B i \u2192 B f \u03bd\u03bd decays are important tools for testing the SM and for searching for possible new physics. As they proceed through an FCNC process, though they are very suppressed in the SM, they show an exceptional sensitivity to short-distance physics that is similar to the K \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03bd decays [36,37]. There are many discussions on the new physics models that may contribute to the s \u2192 d\u03bd\u03bd transition at the loop or even tree level; for a recent review, see Ref. [38]. Unfortunately, no B i \u2192 B f \u03bd\u03bd decays have been searched for experimentally so far. As an example, assuming that the decay \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u03bd\u03bd is dominated by the short-distance contribution, one can make an estimation based on the following relation [39,40]:",

Since the neutrinos in the final states are \"invisible\" in the detector and, at BESIII, the initial energy and momentum of electron and positron are known, one can use the \"tag technique\" to fully reconstruct one of the hyperons and look at the recoil side in the \u03c8 decay into hyperon pairs.

            "text": "Nonzero neutrino mass is now well established [41][42][43][44]; therefore, it is crucially important to study the properties of these nonzero-mass neutrinos. One interesting question is whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac neutrinos [45,46]. Leptonnumber-violating (LNV) interactions with \u2206L = 2 are widely viewed as the most robust test of the Majorana nature of massive neutrinos [45,46]. Currently, neutrinoless double \u03b2 (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) decays of heavy nuclei [47] have become the most sensitive way to search for the effects of very light Majorana neutrinos. However, theoretical analysis of these processes is complicated by the nuclear matrix elements, which are very difficult to calculate reliably. Here we focus on the \u2206L = 2 transitions between spin-1/2 hyperons, B \u2212 i \u2192 B + f l \u2212 l \u2032\u2212 (where l, l \u2032 = e or \u00b5). Examples of these decays are listed in Table VII (Type C). Only one experimental upper limit for the channels listed in Table VII (Type C) has been reported so far, namely, B(\u039e \u2212 \u2192 p\u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 . In the case of the decays listed in Table VII (Type C), two down-type (d or s) quarks convert into two up-quarks, changing the charge of hyperons according to the \u2206Q = \u2206L = +2 rule. These quark transitions are assumed to occur at the same space-time location and, therefore, they are driven by local four-quark operators [48][49][50]. Thus the study of the relatively simpler case provided by 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 hyperons decays may shed some light on the approximations used to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements relevant for similar nuclear decays [48][49][50]. In Ref. [49], based on the model where \u03a3 \u2212 \u2192 pe \u2212 e \u2212 decay is induced by a loop of baryons and light Majorana neutrinos, the predicted branching fraction for \u03a3 \u2212 \u2192 pe \u2212 e \u2212 decay, as an example, is <10 \u221233 , whereas, in Ref. [50], based on a model with four-quark operators, the predicted branching fraction is <10 \u221223 , which is still too small to be observed in any future high-intensity experiment. Thus, any observable rates for these decays must indicate a new interaction beyond the SM.",

            "text": "The SM has been proved to be extremely successful. As we discussed in Subsection V C, the nonzero neutrino mass indicates that the lepton number (L) may be violated. There are also a number of reasons to consider baryon number violation: 1. there is a suggestion originally from Sakharov theory that CP violation combined with a baryon-number-violating (BNV) interaction can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe [51]; 2. many grand unified theories allow the proton to decay [52]; 3. B-L is an important symmetry and, therefore, if \u2206L exists, there is also a \u2206B interaction. In particular, in the SM, in the electroweak phase transition, there is a possibility of a \u2206B, \u2206L transition that conserves B-L, an essential component of theories of leptogenesis [53]. Recently, searches for the BNV and LNV decays of \u039b were performed by the CLAS experiment [54] by using a data set for photoproduction off of the proton collected with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory containing \u223c1.8 \u00d7 10 6 reconstructed \u03b3p \u2192 K + \u039b events. The sensitivities on the branching fraction for each of the processes studied ranged from VIII: Lepton-or baryon-number-violating hyperon decays and expected sensitivities with 10 10 events on the J/\u03c8 peak and 3 \u00d7 10 9 events on the \u03c8(2S) peak. The current data are from CLAS [54] as listed in PDG2016 [3]. \"-\" indicates \"not available,\" l = e or \u00b5, and M \u00b1 refers to the charged stable mesons (M \u00b1 = \u03c0 \u00b1 or K \u00b1 ). Each reaction shows evidence of \u2206L = \u00b11 or/and \u2206B = 0, and each reaction conserves electric charge and angular momentum.",

Hyperon semileptonic and radiative decay are still a challenge on both experimental and theoretical fronts. The rare and forbidden hyperon decays will play important role in the search for new physics [3,[57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67]. In this paper, we propose studying hyperon decays at BESIII with events in the J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) decay into hyperon pairs. We learned that the two-body decays of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) will provide a pristine experimental environment; especially, rare decays and decays with invisible final states can be probed by using the \"tag technique\" with the e + e \u2212 collision experiment. With one year's integrated luminosity at BESIII, \u223c10 6 -10 8 hyperons, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, and \u2126, will be produced in the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays. Based on those samples, the sensitivity for the measurements of the branching fractions of the hyperon decays is in the range of 10 \u22125 -10 \u22128 . Study of hyperon decays will no doubt prove be an unexpected and rewarding research field at BESIII.",

More theoretical efforts should be focused on the \u2206L = 2 LNV decays B \u2212 i \u2192 B + f l \u2212 l \u2032\u2212 , which may have an impact on massive neutrinos [71]. There are no theoretical estimations of the B i \u2192 B f \u03bd\u03bd decays, and efforts on the analogous K + (K L ) \u2192 \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 )\u03bd\u03bd decay could be applied to hyperon decays, for example, to the recent lattice QCD calculations on the Z-penguin-like kaon decays [72][73][74].",
