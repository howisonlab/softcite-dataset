We use 520 fb \u22121 of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider operating at center of mass energies near 10.6 GeV.

The KM ansatz has been tested at high precision in K and B decays, where the KM phase contributes to the quark transition amplitude at tree level. However, further experimental efforts are needed in D meson decays, where CP violating amplitudes are predicted to contribute to the observables at the 10 \u22123 level [2].",

New physics models introduce CP violation in D meson decays through tree and one-loop diagrams. While predictions for CP violation in tree diagrams are not different from those in the SM (O(10 \u22123 )), new physics in loop diagrams may enhance CP violation effects at the order of 10 \u22122 [7].",

Our MC simulations, however, show that the presence of these backgrounds does not bias the extraction of the D + (s) meson yields. As a further check, we select a high purity data sample (87.5 %) of D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays and assign the K + mass alternatively to both \u03c0 + . We compute the asymmetries on the resulting integrated distributions and find that they are all consistent with zero. A similar result is obtained when we perform the test on MC events.",
