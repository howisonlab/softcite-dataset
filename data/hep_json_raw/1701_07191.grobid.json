            "text": "Two-body baryonic decays of \u03c8 mesons (\u03c8 denotes both the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) charmonium states throughout the text), take place through annihilation of the constituent cc quark pair into either a virtual photon or three gluons, and they provide a good laboratory for testing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the perturbative energy regime and studying the properties of baryons [1]. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts that the ratio of branching fractions between the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686) decaying into a given hadronic final states follows the \"12% rule\" [2] Q = B \u03c8(3686)\u2192h B J/\u03c8\u2192h = B \u03c8(3686)\u2192l + l \u2212 B J/\u03c8\u2192l + l \u2212 \u2248 (12.4 \u00b1 0.4)%. (1) The violation of this rule was first observed in the decay of \u03c8 into the final state \u03c1\u03c0, which is well known as the \"\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\" [3], and the rule has been subsequently further tested in a wide variety of experimental measurements. Reviews of the theoretical and experimental results [5] conclude that the current theoretical understanding, especially for the \u03c8 decays into baryon-antibaryon pair final states, is not mature. The branching fractions of \u03c8 decays into BB (BB refers to both \u039b\u039b and \u03a3 0\u03a30 throughout the text) final states from different experiments [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] and the Particle Data Group (PDG) [4] averages are summarized in Table I. Obvious differences between the different experiments are observed, and the uncertainties are relatively large. Hence, higher precision measurements of the \u03c8 decays into BB pairs are desirable to help in understanding the dynamics of \u03c8 decay.",

The equation is derived from the general helicity formalism [1], taking into account the gluon spin, the quark distribution amplitudes in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2192 BB, and hadron helicity conservation. The \u03b1 values in the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 BB have been calculated with pQCD to first-order [16]. It is believed that the masses of the baryon and quark must be taken into consideration in the \u03b1 calculation since a large violation of helicity conservation is observed in \u03c8 decays [16,17]. Table II summarizes the theoretical predictions and experimental \u03b1 values for the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 BB. To date, the experimental \u03b1 values for the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 BB have poor precision [6,7,11], and the alpha values in the decay \u03c8(3686) \u2192 BB have not yet been measured. It is worth noting that there is an indication that the \u03b1 value in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03a3 0\u03a30 is negative in Ref. [11].  [11] In this paper, we report precise measurements of the branching fractions and \u03b1 values for the decays \u03c8 \u2192 BB, based on the data samples of (1310.6\u00b17.0)\u00d710 6 J/\u03c8 [18] and (447.9 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 6 \u03c8(3686) [19] events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider.",

The BESIII detector has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 solid angle and consists of the following main components: (1) A small-celled, helium based (40% CO 2 and 60% C 3 H 8 ) main drift chamber (MDC) with 43 layers, which has an average singlewire resolution of 135 \u00b5m, a momentum resolution for 1 GeV/c charged particles in a 1 T magnetic field of 0.5% \u2020 , and a specific energy loss (dE/dx) resolution of better than 6%. (2) An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which consists of 6240 CsI (Tl) crystals arranged in a cylindrical shape (barrel) plus two end-caps. For 1.0 GeV photons, the energy resolution is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (end-caps), and the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) for the barrel (end-caps). (3) A time-of-flight (TOF) system, which is used for particle identification (PID). It is composed of a barrel made of two layers, each consisting of 88 pieces of 5 cm thick and 2.4 m long plastic scintillators, as well as two end-caps each with 96 fan-shaped 5 cm thick plastic scintillators. The time resolution is 80 ps (110 ps) in the barrel (end-caps), providing a K/\u03c0 separation of more than 2\u03c3 for momenta up to 1.0 GeV/c. (4) A muon chamber system, which is made of resistive plate chambers (RPCs) arranged in 9 layers (8 layers) in the barrel (end-caps) with \u223c 2 cm position resolution. It is incorporated into the return iron yoke of the superconducting magnet.",

For example, the efficiencies related with charged particle tracking and \u039b reconstruction are studied with a special control sample of \u03c8 \u2192 \u039b\u039b events, where a\u039b tag has been reconstructed.

The uncertainties related with the fit range are estimated by changing the range by \u00b11 times the mass resolution for the fits. The signal shapes are modeled with the signal MC simulated shapes convolved with a Gaussian function in the nominal fit. The corresponding uncertainties are estimated with alternative fits with different signal shapes, i.e., a Breit-Wigner function convolved with a Gaussian function for \u039b and with a Crystal Ball function [31] for \u03a3 0 , where the Gaussian function and Crystal Ball function represent the corresponding mass resolutions. The uncertainties related with the peaking backgrounds, which are estimated with the exclusive MC samples in the nominal fits, are studied by changing the branching fractions of the individual background, or by changing the branching fractions for the reference decays which the estimated branching fractions for the undetermined backgrounds are based on, by \u00b11 times their uncertainties from the PDG [4]. The uncertainties associated with the non-peaking backgrounds are estimated with alternative fits by replacing the second order polynomial function with a first order polynomial function.

The decay branching fractions and \u03b1 values are measured, and the results are summarized in Table VI. The branching fractions for J/\u03c8 decays are in good agreement with the results of BESII [11] and BaBar [13] experiments, and those for \u03c8(3686) decays are in agreement with the results of CLEO [10], BESII [12] and S. Dobbs et al. [14] with a maximum of 2 times of standard deviations. The earlier experimental results [6][7][8][9] have significant differences with those of this analysis. The precisions of our branching fraction results are much improved than those of previous experiments listed in Table I. The \u03b1 values in the decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u039b\u039b and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03a3 0\u03a30 are measured for the first time, while those of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u039b\u039b and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03a3 0\u03a30 decays are of much improved precision compared to previous measurements. It is worth noting that the \u03b1 value in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03a3 0\u03a30 is negative, which confirms the results in Ref. [11].",
