The modulations of muons and neutrons are caused by a temperature effect, the seasonal temperature and density variations of the upper atmospheric layers. The analysis performed here leads to the conclusion that the variations in the mean energy of the muon flux are the main source of underground cosmogenic neutron variations, because the energy of muons is more sensitive to the temperature effect than their intensity. The parameters of the seasonal modulations in the mean energy of muons and the flux of cosmogenic neutrons at the LVD depth have been determined from the data obtained over seven years of LVD operation.",

The muon intensity variations at great depths are considered as a possible source of the seasonal modulations of events in low-background detectors. It is assumed that the modulations can be produced by cosmogenic neutrons whose flux is linearly related to the varying muon flux.",

            "text": "The cause of the seasonal muon variations at sea level and underground is well known [5], [6], [7]. This is a temperature effect that leads to a change in the density of the terrestrial atmosphere and its height as a result of its heating in summer and cooling in winter. On the one hand, a decrease in the density of the upper atmospheric layers (stratosphere) through expansion when heated leads to an increase in the probability of the \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5 decays of first generation charged pions from extensive air showers (EASs) and to a corresponding decrease in the number of pions (and the number of their decays \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5) in the last generations. On the other hand, the atmosphere expansion increases the probability of the \u00b5 \u2192 e decays of low energy muons on their way to the Earth. The first fact, an increase in the probability of the decays \u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5, gives a positive temperature effect observed in the high energy muon flux. The last two facts associated with low energy muons lead to a negative temperature effect, a reduction in the muon intensity at sea level, where the mean muon energy is \u223c 4 GeV. The observed muon variations are determined by the combined action of the negative and positive effects. The negative component dominates approximately down to 20 meters water equivalent (m w.e.). Its contribution is decreased with a depth increasing and becomes negligible starting from approximately 200 m w.e. (E \u00b5 = 35 GeV). Muons at energies above 1 TeV produced at pA-interaction energies above 100 TeV can reach depths greater than 2 km w.e. The positive temperature effect is clearly observed at large underground facilities [8], [9], [10].",

Apart from the seasonal modulations, the temperature of the upper atmospheric layers undergoes irregular variations over a year. As a result, the number of neutrons produced by muons underground deviates considerably from the harmonic function (2) with a breakdown of the constancy of the modulation amplitude \u03b4N and the fluctuation phase t n 0 . This should be taken into account when analyzing the background in low-background underground experiments.",
