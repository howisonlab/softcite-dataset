The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 18.8 and 19.6 fb \u22121 in the dimuon and dielectron channels, respectively, containing 8.2 million dimuon and 4.9 million dielectron events. With more events and new analysis techniques, including constraints obtained on the parton distribution functions from the measured forward-backward asymmetry, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced relative to previous CMS measurements. The extracted value of sin 2 \u03b8 eff from the combined dilepton data is sin 2 \u03b8 eff = 0.23101 \u00b1 0.00036 (stat) \u00b1 0.00018 (syst) \u00b1 0.00016 (theo) \u00b1 0.00031 (parton distributions in proton) = 0.23101 \u00b1 0.00053.",

We do not use these events, and the integrated luminosity in the dimuon analysis is therefore somewhat smaller than for dielectrons. Background contamination is reduced by applying identification and isolation criteria to the reconstructed muons. First, muon tracks are required to be reconstructed independently in the inner tracker and in the outer muon detectors. A global fit to the momentum, including both tracker and muon detector hits, must have a fitted \u03c7 2 /dof < 10, where dof stands for the degrees of freedom. Muon tracks are required to pass within a transverse distance of 0.2 cm from the primary vertex, defined as the pp vertex with the largest p 2 T of its associated tracks. Muon candidates are rejected if the scalarp T sum of all tracks within a cone of R = \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.3 around the muon is larger than 10% of the p T of the muon (this is referred to as track isolation, with \u03c6 being the azimuth in radians). The track isolation requirement is insensitive to contributions from additional soft pp interactions (pileup). An event is selected when there are at least two isolated muons, with the leading muon (i.e., the one with largest p T ) having p T > 25 GeV, and the next-to-leading muon having p T > 15 GeV.

To ensure good reconstruction, the coverage is restricted to |\u03b7| < 2.4, excluding the transition region of 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.57 between the ECAL barrel and endcap detectors, as electron reconstruction in this region is not optimal.

The multijet background in dimuon events, dominated by muons from heavy-flavor hadron decays, is evaluated using same-sign (SS) dimuon events. A small EW and top quark contamination is evaluated in an MC simulation and subtracted from the SS sample. The distributions are then scaled by roughly a factor of 2, estimated from simulated events, to obtain the multijet contamination in the signal OS dimuon sample. The multijet background in the dielectron analysis is evaluated using the SS sample in combination with the e\u03bc events to subtract the contribution from the OS events caused by the misidentification of charge. The distributions used to estimate the background from jets misidentified as leptons (that include the multijet and W+jet events) are obtained from the SS e\u03bc sample. These distributions are used to fit the dielectron mass distribution in the SS events in each y bin to extract the normalization of this background.",

The default signal distributions are based on the powheg v2 event generator using the NNPDF3.0 PDFs [17]. The powheg generator is interfaced with pythia 8 [16] and the CUETP8M1 [31] underlying event tune to provide parton showering and hadronization, including electromagnetic FSR. The dependence on sin 2 \u03b8 eff , on the renormalization and factorization scales, and on the PDFs is modeled through the powheg MC generator that provides matrix-element-based, event-by-event weights for each change in these parameters. The distributions are modified to different values of sin 2 \u03b8 eff by weighting each event in the full simulation by the ratio of cos \u03b8 * distributions obtained with the modified and default configurations in each (m , y ) bin. The uncertainties in the simulation of the detector have a small effect because A FB is extracted through the angular event-weighting technique that is insensitive to efficiency and acceptance. Table 1 summarizes the statistical uncertainty in the extracted sin 2 \u03b8 eff in the muon and electron channels and in their combination. Comparisons between the data and best-fit distributions are shown in Fig. 4. The statistical uncertainties are evaluated through the bootstrapping technique [41], and take account of correlations among the measured A FB , lepton selection efficiencies, and calibration coefficients introduced through the repeated use of the same dilepton events. We generate 400 pseudo-experiments that provide an accurate estimate of the statistical uncertainties and correlations. In each pseudo-experiment, every event in the data is replicated n times, where n is a random number sampled from a Poisson distribution with a mean of unity. All steps of the analysis, including extraction of muon selection efficiencies, calibration coefficients, and a measurement of A FB , are performed for each pseudo-experiment. The statistical uncertainties in electron-selection efficiencies and calibration coefficients,  which have no charge dependence, are small and are evaluated separately.",

Then, the same technique is applied as used in the NNPDF analysis. The results of fits for these PDFs are summarized in Fig. 8. After Bayesian \u03c7 2 reweighting the central predictions for all PDFs are closer to each other, and the corresponding uncertainties are significantly reduced. The result using CT14 is within about 1/3 of the PDF uncertainty of the NNPDF3.0 result in the muon channel, whereas the MMHT2014 set yields a smaller sin 2 \u03b8 eff value by about one standard deviation. Some of these differences can be reduced by adding more data (e.g. including the electron channel, which is not considered in this check). Some can be attributed to the residual differences in the valence and sea quark distributions, which are not fully constrained using the A FB distributions alone. For example, we find that the NLO NNPDF3.0 PDF set yields a very good description for the published 8 TeV CMS muon charge asymmetry (\u03c7 2 of 4.6 for 11 dof).

As a baseline model, we use the powheg event generator for the inclusive pp \u2192 Z/\u03b3 \u2192 process at leading electroweak order, where the weak mixing angle is interpreted through the improved Born approximation as the effective angle incorporating higher-order corrections. With more data and new analysis techniques, including precise lepton-momentum calibration, angular event weighting, and additional constraints on PDFs, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced relative to previous CMS measurements. The combined result from the dielectron and dimuon channels is: sin 2 \u03b8 eff = 0.23101 \u00b1 0.00036 (stat) \u00b1 0.00018 (syst) \u00b10.00016 (theo) \u00b1 0.00031 (PDF), (16) or summing the uncertainties in quadrature, sin 2 \u03b8 eff = 0.23101 \u00b1 0.00053.",
