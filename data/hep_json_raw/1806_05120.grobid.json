            "text": "For more than 40 years various astrophysical observations have suggested the existence of dark matter (DM) [1]. Extensions of the Standard Model predict candidate particles classified as either weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a typical mass of GeV-TeV, or weakly-interacting slim particles (WISPs) with \u00b5eV-eV [2]. Despite of intensive nuclear recoil experiments WIMPs have been escaping from detection so far, while many ambitious projects have recently been proposed and proceed to search for WISPs, such as axions and hidden photons (HPs) [3][4][5][6][7]. Especially, a wide area of the HP parameter space, defined by its mass m \u03b3 \u2032 and the photon-HP kinetic mixing \u03c7, is still unexplored and allowed for the cold DM [8,9].",

This mixing is currently being investigated by using microwave resonant cavities [6,7,[10][11][12][13][14]. While the cavity experiments enhance the conversion power resonantly in a narrow frequency band, the resonant frequency needs to be scanned to cover a broad mass region. Recently, a new method using a metallic mirror has been proposed to obtain a broadband sensitivity over a full detector bandwidth [15]. In such a setup HPDM is converted at the surface of the mirror to ordinary photons. The electromagnetic boundary condition constrains the direction of emitted photons to perpendicular to the surface with a small angular spread \u223c 10 \u22123 rad, corresponding to the velocity dispersion of the incident HPs parallel to the conversion surface [16]. The emitted power is focused on a detector by using focusing optics, or using a curved mirror that works for both conversion and focusing. A mirror with an area of A mirror emits a HP power of",

This mass region is particularly interesting, since a relatively large kinetic mixing, as high as \u03c7 \u223c 10 \u22129 , is still not excluded by cosmological and astrophysical observations [8]. This work presents our phase 1 setup using heterodyne detection with a room-temperature receiver system and a small-sized dish antenna with an area of 0.2 m 2 . Figure 1 shows an overview of the experimental setup. HPDM is converted to ordinary photons on a plane conversion surface and focused by a parabolic mirror. Both mirrors are made of aluminum, which is commonly used for the mirror material of mm-waves due to its high reflectivity to these waves. The conversion mirror has an area of 0.6 m \u00d7 0.6 m and emits plane electromagnetic waves perpendicular to its surface. The waves are focused by the parabolic mirror with a diameter of 0.5 m and a focal length f of 1.5 m. Placing the conversion mirror and the receiver at the same distance from the focusing mirror (z = f ) minimizes the power loss due to the effective reduction of the conversion area. This double  mirror configuration has the advantage of being able to focus the signal power with a smaller directional spread compared to the setup using a single spherical mirror [25]. The focused waves couple to a corrugated horn antenna shown in Fig. 2. The coupling to the antenna can be calculated by evaluating the overlap integral between the focused beam and the antenna beam [26]. This yields a power coupling",

The conversion loss of the SBD was measured before the HP search at 30 frequencies between 160 GHz and 220 GHz (\"SBD input range\"), by using a backward wave oscillator (Microtech, QS1-260-OV-24) as a variable-frequency mm-wave source.

The SBD couples to a linear polarization and thus effectively detects a half of the incident HP power on average, since the photons emitted from the conversion surface have random polarizations. The output power from the SBD is increased by two amplifiers (R&K LA130-0S), whose gain curves were measured using a vector network analyzer (Anritsu, MS2024B).

To cancel short-term temperature dependencies of these peaks, signal and background acquisitions were repeated alternately for each 80 s. These changes are remotely controlled by a PC placed in the next room without disrupting the measurement condition by entering the Faraday cage. Table 1 shows a summary of the data sets. Signal peaks are searched in the frequency domain of oscilloscope spectra. A typical power spectrum of a single acquisition is shown in Fig. 3, that has been normalized with the receiver system gain described in Sec. 2. The overall spectral height represents the noise level of the receiver system. The broad structure that oscillates with a frequency of 100 \u2212 200 MHz is most likely to arise from power resonances, such as in RF cables. The expected mm-wave HPDM signal has a sharp Maxwellian distribution over a few bins due to the DM velocity dispersion and is added on top of white noise on the baseline oscillation. To extract the noise component, the spectrum is fitted to a quadratic function for 40-bin intervals and subtracted by the obtained baseline function [10]. The resulting spectrum contains white noise and peaks having large positive power, as shown in Fig. 3. These peaks are spurious and originate from residual radio contamination, because they also appear at the same IF frequency even in the LO-detuned background spectrum. These spurious peaks are eliminated by subtracting the spectrum of the corresponding background measurement. The subtractions are operated locally around the spurious peaks to keep the noise level smaller by a factor of \u221a 2 for most of the white spectrum, compared to subtraction of the entire background spectrum.",

To sum up the signal power, we apply a co-adding scheme, that simply takes the sum over the four adjacent bins to each frequency bin [12]. This approach is robust since it does not assume any specific line shape on the signal discrimination, and is thus valid even if the actual local DM velocity distribution is not Maxwellian or contains some substructure [29]. Figure 4 (right) shows the co-added ENR spectrum. According to the frequency dependence of the SBD conversion loss measured at many points (Sec. 2), we divide the whole SBD input range into 19 sub-regions, where the conversion loss is regarded as constant. Generally, candidate peaks above a certain ENR threshold are investigated by additional measurements that test whether they are truly statistical fluctuations. While the rescanning measurement contributes to reject noise fluctuations [10][11][12], we get around this step by taking the largest ENR as the threshold in each sub-region. They are commonly distributed in the range of 9-12 ENRs, beyond which no significant peaks are observed. Since we expect one or more peaks above the highest observed ENR within the whole spectrum with a probability of \u2248 14%, non of the observed peaks is significant enough to claim a signal. In order to obtain a limit on the observed HPDM power, the power level that gives ENRs beyond the threshold with a probability of 90% was estimated by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, since neighboring bin contents are correlated. The MC spectra are produced in a data driven manner, where white Gaussian noise and a Maxwellian signal are superimposed to the baseline spectrum of real data [10][11][12]. Changing the signal power for 4000 masses randomly selected in the SBD input range, we applied the same analysis to the MC data and obtain a power limit in each sub-region, which is typically P \u223c 10 \u221213 W. If HPDM has a very small velocity dispersion in contrast to the above virialized scenario, it would deposit all power into a single bin. In this \"unvirialized\" case, the power limits are directly calculated from the single-bin thresholds in Fig. 4 (left) by using conventional Gaussian statistics [13].",

However, the motion of the solar system in our galaxy induces the so-called \"DM wind\" at \u223c 220 km s \u22121 in the rest frame of the earth. The direction of the wind observed in the laboratory frame changes in time due to the revolution and the rotation of the earth. This effect shifts the overall direction of perpendicularly emitted photons by at most 10 \u22123 rad (= \u03b8 w ) [25]. It leads to a displacement of the focal spot by f \u03b8 w with f the focal length (= 1.5 m).

The focal power would also be reduced by the surface roughness of the two mirrors, causing phase errors of the emitted and reflected mm-waves. The phase error becomes important especially to the parabolic mirror since it requires elaborate surface processing. The surface roughness was measured to be less than 30 \u00b5m by the manufacturer and is thus much smaller than the mm-wavelengths we receive. The corresponding phase error is estimated to reduce the power by a factor of 0.97 [30,31]. (iii) The frequency stability of the detection electronics is limited by the signal generator. It has a temperature dependence of \u00b11 ppm over 0 \u2212 55 \u2022 C. The monitored room temperature shows seasonal changes in the range of \u00b13 \u2022 C throughout the search, that corresponds to the fluctuation in f IF of about \u00b110 kHz. It causes broadening of the Maxwellian power spectrum, giving at most 1.5% of the power spilling out of co-added four bins (4 \u00d7 76 kHz). The largest systematic uncertainty in the receiver system is found in the total gain after the SBD and the two amplifiers. As described in Sec. 2, we carried out these studies before the HPDM search and its uncertainty is already included in the analysis by conservatively using the minimum gain in each sub-region.",

We compare the result with other limits in Fig. 5 (right). The filled areas show the excluded regions from direct measurements. Our search provides new limits, that are almost compatible to the astrophysical constraints from the solar energy loss argument and from the solar HP search in xenon experiments [39][40][41]. While their estimation of the HP flux on the earth inevitably depends on a solar model, the limit obtained here postulates only the local DM energy density on the HP flux.

Supposing that the ENR threshold is reduced by a factor of R in a reasonable run time, it lowers the limit on \u03c7 by R 1/2 . Moreover, we note that decreasing the conversion loss by using other harmonics N or by optimizing the LO power may allow for significant improvements in future. To improve the sensitivity more drastically, one can use a cryogenic receiver applying a superconducting tunnel junction, and a low-temperature preamplifier. This would reduce the noise compared to the current room-temperature system by many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, coating dielectric layers on the mirror surface has been pointed out to boost the emitted power [3,4]. This interesting and promising scheme is currently being studied in a proof-of-concept phase as in Refs. [4,5].",
