The missing mass analysis was performed to search for the decay channel K + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd H with a hypothetic stable heavy neutrino in the final state. The obtained missing mass spectrum does not show peaks that could be attributed to existence of stable heavy neutrinos in the mass range (270 < m \u03bd H < 375) MeV/c 2 . As a result, upper limits on the branching ratio and on the value of the mixing element |U \u03bcH | 2 are obtained.",

One of the promising research directions is inspired by observed neutrino oscillations [1][2][3][4] which require non zero neutrino masses which, in turn, open possibility for existence of a set of heavy sterile neutrinos in one of the SM extensions -the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) [5][6][7]. Depending on the lifetime of those heavy neutrinos (\u03bd H ) experimental approaches can be divided into searches for possible a e-mail: Alexander.Sadovskiy@ihep.ru b Also at University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK c Also at National Research Nuclear University (MEPhI), Moscow, and Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia decay products of \u03bd H , as, for example, reported in [8] or more recently in [9] and into searches for \u03bd H with a long lifetime with the missing mass approach [10] and, recently, in two high statistics experiments [11][12][13], which reported upper limits on branching for \u03bd H in a hundred MeV/c 2 range. To contribute to the latter approach we analyzed a large data sample of K + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd recorded in 2012 by the OKA collaboration at IHEP-Protvino to search for a possible process K + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd H , see Fig. 1, where \u03bd H stands for one of the expected sterile \u03bd H within \u03bdMSM and U \u03bcH represents mixing element between SM muon neutrino and \u03bd H .",

The cavities are cooled by superfluid He provided by the dedicated IHEP-build cryogenic system [16].

The r.m.s. width of the momentum distribution is estimated to be 1.5%. The OKA setup, Fig. 2, is a magnetic spectrometer complemented by electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and a Decay Volume.

Again we do a common fit for signal plus background, where we allow the tuning of Fig. 10 The OKA upper limit on the mixing matrix element |U \u03bcH | 2 at 90% CL is shown in solid dark-gray curve in comparison with preceding experiments: the long-dashed black curve represents the result from KEK-E-089 [10], the fine-dashed red curve corresponds to the result from BNL E949 [11]   the background parameters for each investigated position. In this case the obtained upper limit at 90% CL is shown with the dashed curve (c) in Fig. 9. This approach, however, is more sensitive to impurity of the signal, so as the final result curve (b) shall be used, as it uses realistic information about background shape and does not artificially suppresses signal (in contrast to approach a). A difference between these three approaches can be can be treated as a systematic error of the method.",
