Candidate events have a signature consistent with containing two isolated leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and at least two jets. Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.70 fb \u22121 , a tt production cross section \u03c3 tt = 176 \u00b1 5(stat.) +14   \u221211 (syst.) \u00b1 8(lum.) pb is measured for an assumed top-quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV.

The measurement of the tt production cross section in different decay modes is a sensitive test of perturbative QCD and the SM description of top-quark decay. The production cross section in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV is calculated to be 165 +11 \u221216 pb at approximate next-tonext-to-leading-order (NNLO) [1,2], and the top quark is predicted to decay nearly 100% of the time to a W boson and a b quark. A measured cross section that differs from the SM prediction can be a sign of new physics. Furthermore, tt production is an important background in many searches for physics beyond the SM, and in searches for the SM Higgs boson.",

With the additional requirement of the presence of a jet consistent with a b quark ('b-tag'), the signal-to-background ratio can be further improved. Cross-section measurements with and without the b-tag requirement are reported here. Leptons are either well-identified electron or muon candidates that are selected using the full detector or, to reduce losses from lepton identification inefficiencies, isolated tracks. The well-identified electrons or muons are called 'identified leptons', and the isolated tracks are referred to as 'track leptons'. The term 'lepton' is used to refer to identified leptons and track leptons collectively. Events with one identified lepton and one track lepton are called 'lepton+track' events. Each dilepton channel is exclusive, i.e. has no overlap with the other channels. Channels with tau leptons are not explicitly reconstructed, but reconstructed leptons can arise from leptonic tau decays and a track lepton can arise from hadronic tau decay modes as well. The analysis with the b-tag requirement uses only identified leptons.",

For jets within the acceptance, the JES uncertainty varies in the range 4-8% as a function of jet p T and \u03b7. This uncertainty is higher than in the previous result [6] because of the additional uncertainty due to multiple pp interactions at high instantaneous luminosity. The jet energy resolution and jet reconstruction/identification efficiency measured in data and in simulation are in good agreement. The statistical uncertainties on the comparisons, 10% and 1-2% for the energy resolution and the efficiency, respectively, are taken as systematic uncertainties associated with these effects. The effect on the acceptance is dominated by the JES uncertainty.",

The systematic uncertainties from the background evaluations derived from the data include the statistical uncertainties in these methods as well as the systematic uncertainties arising from lepton and jet identification and reconstruction, and the MC estimates that are used. An uncertainty on the data-driven Z/\u03b3 * +jets evaluation, based on the expected E miss T resolution in these events, is included by varying the E miss T cut in the control region by \u00b15 GeV for ee and \u00b5\u00b5 events, and \u00b110 GeV in lepton+track events where the E miss T resolution is poorer. The systematic uncertainty on the fake identified lepton background prediction is 50%, as measured using control regions with different flavor composition and photon conversion rates, as determined by Monte Carlo studies. A 20% systematic uncertainty is set on the prediction of the fake track-lepton background, derived from a comparison of predicted and observed fake track leptons in control regions defined as opposite-sign events with zero or one jet without an H T cut, and same-sign events with more than one jet. The uncertainty on the measured integrated luminosity of the dataset is 3.7% [9]. Table 2 lists the contributions to the cross-section measurement of each of the systematic uncertainties considered, in percent, with the non-b-tag and the exclusive b-tag analyses combined in the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 columns. Only non-b-tag events are used in the e\u00b5 channel. The relatively large 'Generator' uncertainty for ee events is partly a result of the limited size of the MC data set. In the eTL and \u00b5TL columns the 'MC statistics' uncertainty is larger than in the ee, \u00b5\u00b5, and e\u00b5 case because the number of events available is reduced by the removal of events with two identified leptons. The combined uncertainty comes from the profile likelihood technique used to determine the cross section [6], and takes into account all correlations. The statistical uncertainty is determined by fixing all systematic uncertainties at their best-fit values in the likelihood function.  The cross-section results are obtained with a profile likelihood technique, as described in ref.",
