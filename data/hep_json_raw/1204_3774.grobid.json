Results are reported from a data sample collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.98 fb \u22121 . This search is part of a broad program of inclusive, signature-based searches for BSM physics at CMS, characterized by the number and type of objects in the final state. Since it is not known a priori how the BSM physics will be manifest, we perform searches in events containing jets and missing transverse energy (E miss T ) [1][2][3], single isolated leptons [4], pairs of opposite-sign [5] and same-sign [6] isolated leptons, photons [7,8], etc. Here we search for evidence of BSM physics in final states containing a Z boson that decays to a pair of oppositely-charged isolated electrons or muons. Searches for BSM physics in events containing oppositely-charged leptons have also been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration [9][10][11].",

Our search is also motivated by the existence of cosmological cold dark matter [20], which could consist of weakly-interacting massive particles [21] such as the lightest SUSY neutralino in R-parity conserving SUSY models [22]. If produced in pp collisions, these particles would escape detection and yield events with large E miss T . Finally, we search for BSM physics in events containing hadronic jets. This is motivated by the fact that new, heavy, strongly-interacting particles predicted by many BSM scenarios may be produced with a large cross section and hence be observable in early LHC data, and such particles tend to decay to hadronic jets. These considerations lead us to our target signature consisting of a leptonically-decaying Z boson produced in association with jets and E miss T .",

As discussed in the introduction, we pursue two complementary approaches to evaluate the Z + jets background. Samples of Z + jets, tt, WW, WZ, and ZZ Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events generated with Mad-Graph 5.1.1.0 [36] are used to guide the design of these methods, but the dominant backgrounds are estimated with techniques based on data control samples. Events produced by MadGraph are passed to pythia 6.4.22 [37] for the generation of parton showers. Additional MC samples of Z + jets, \u03b3 + jets, and QCD multijet events generated with pythia 6.4.22 are used to validate the E miss T template method of Section 5. We also present the expected event yields for two benchmark scenarios of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (CMSSM) [38], denoted LM4 and LM8 [39], which are generated with the same version of pythia. The CMSSM is described with five parameters: the universal scalar and gaugino masses m 0 and m 1/2 , the universal soft SUSY-breaking parameter A 0 , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets tan \u03b2, and the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc. The LM4 (LM8) parameter sets are m 0 = 210 (500) GeV, m 1/2 = 285 (300) GeV, tan \u03b2 = 10, sign(\u03bc) = +, and A 0 = 0 (\u2212300) GeV. The LM4 scenario is excluded in Ref. [3];",

The probability of a downward fluctuation of the jet energy measurement is in general higher than the probability of an upward fluctuation, leading to an asymmetry of the JZB distribution in SM Z events with exactly 1 jet. However, the JZB distribution in SM Z + jets events becomes more Gaussian with increasing jet multiplicity, because in multijet events the direction of a mismeasured jet is uncorrelated with the direction of the Z boson. Already in three-jet events, where in the most probable configuration, the two leading jets are back-toback [42], instrumental effects largely cancel.

Table 2 also shows the LM4 and LM8 yields, determined using NLO production cross sections. These yields are corrected to account for the contribution of signal to the background control regions, which tends to suppress the apparent yield of signal in the signal region. The correction is performed by subjecting the signal samples to the same procedures as the data and subtracting the resulting prediction from the signal yield in the signal region.

We provide the signal selection efficiencies in the model parameter space. These efficiencies may be employed to validate and calibrate the results of fast simulation software used to determine the signal efficiency of an arbitrary BSM model. This allows our results to be applied to BSM models beyond those examined in this Letter. We also provide cross section upper limits in the parameter space of these models, and exclude a region of the parameter space assuming reference cross sections and a 100% branching fraction to the final state under consideration (the Z boson is allowed to decay according to the well-known SM branching fractions).  > 300 GeV for N jets 2 used for the SMS exclusions of Section 7. The total predicted background (total bkg) is the sum of the Z + jets background predicted from the \u03b3 + jets E miss T templates method (Z bkg), the background predicted from opposite-flavor events (OF bkg), and the WZ + ZZ background predicted from simulation (VZ bkg). The uncertainties include both the statistical and systematic contributions. For the observed yield (data), the first (second) number in parentheses is the yield in the ee (\u03bc\u03bc) final state.

The model-dependent systematic uncertainties (energy scale and PDF uncertainties) are determined for each point. To interpret these limits in terms of the gluino pair-production cross section, we use a reference cross section \u03c3 NLO-QCD and determine the 95% CL exclusion contours at 1/3, 1, and 3 times \u03c3 NLO-QCD , to establish how the limit changes with the cross section. This reference cross section \u03c3 NLO-QCD corresponds to gluino pair-production in the limit of infinitely heavy squarks, calculated at NLO using prospino [48] and the CTEQ6 [40] PDFs. Fig. 5 shows the signal selection efficiency times acceptance for the JZB > 150 GeV signal region for the topology described above, normalized to the number of events with at least one leptonicallydecaying Z. The 95% CL upper limits on the total gluino pairproduction cross section are also shown. The JZB > 250 GeV region has the best sensitivity throughout most of the parameter space of this model. The signal contribution to the Z + jets control sample has been taken into account in these limits. In this mass spectrum, the Z boson and E miss T directions are weakly correlated and the sensitivity of the JZB search is reduced at low LSP masses.   95% CL upper limits on the total gluino pair-production cross section. The region to the left of the solid contour is excluded assuming that the gluino pair-production cross section is \u03c3 NLO-QCD , and that the branching fraction to this SMS topology is 100%. The dotted and dashed contours indicate the excluded region when the cross section is varied by a factor of three. The signal contribution to the control regions is negligible.",

Backgrounds from tt processes are estimated using opposite-flavor lepton pairs and dilepton invariant mass sidebands. We find no evidence for anomalous yields beyond standard model (SM) expectations and place upper limits on the non-SM contributions to the yields in the signal regions.

The two control samples are complementary. The \u03b3 + jets events have a topology that is similar to the Z + jets events, since both consist of a well-measured object recoiling against a system of hadronic jets. When selecting photons, we include hadronic jets in which a large fraction of the energy is carried by photons or neutral pions. Such jets are well measured; the E miss T in these events arises from jets with a large hadronic energy fraction as in the true \u03b3 + jets events. The QCD multijet sample has better statistical precision due to the larger number of events, and eliminates possible contributions to E miss T from mismeasurement of the photon in the \u03b3 + jets sample. The E miss T templates extracted from the QCD sample must be corrected for a small bias of the E miss T",
