This final state is predicted in several models of Physics beyond the SM, including supersymmetry. A novel analysis method is exploited, the Jet-Z Balance method, and a precise determination of the total SM background is obtained using a control sample from data. In the absence of any significant excess beyond the SM background, upper limits are set on simple models of supersymmetry, and further information is provided to allow confrontation of other models to these results.",

The reference cross-section corresponds to gluino pair production in the limit of infinitely heavy squarks, calculated at next to leading order using PROSPINO [7] and CTEQ6 [8] parton distribution functions.  In this simplified model, the JZB analysis is mostly sensitive to topologies in which the Z boson and the LSP have a momentum in the rest frame of the neutralino that is small with respect to the momentum of the neutralino [9]. In the considered set of simplified models, this topology is realized in the region where the difference between the LSP mass and the gluino mass is small, as the JZB distribution for signal is very asymmetric and signal contamination has little impact on the sensitivity.",
