Predictions for the differential and fiducial cross sections are available up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD and include EW corrections at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy [1][2][3]. The rapidity distribution of EW boson production is sensitive to the underlying QCD dynamics and, in particular, to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) which define the initial kinematics of the hard process. Therefore, measurements of weak-boson production offer an excellent opportunity to test models of parton dynamics.",

These measurements provide precision tests of the QCD theory and PDFs, which can be complemented with measurements at the additional centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 5.02 TeV. This paper describes measurements of the production cross sections times leptonic branching ratios for the inclusive W + \u2192 + \u03bd, W \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u03bd and Z \u2192 + \u2212 ( = e, \u03bc) processes. Integrated and differential cross sections are measured in a fiducial phase space defined by detector acceptance and lepton kinematics. For W \u00b1 bosons the decay lepton charge asymmetry is also determined. All measurements are performed with pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25.0 pb \u22121 , collected at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The data were recorded during the autumn of 2015. The peak instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC was L = 3.8 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 and the mean number of pp interactions per bunch crossing (hard scattering and pile-up events) was 1.5. Therefore, this dataset is characterised by a relatively low pile-up contribution as compared to the measurements of weak-boson production performed at higher centre-of-mass energies by ATLAS.",

The inner-detector system (ID) is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. At small radii, a high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the interaction region and typically provides four measurements per track. It is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which usually provides eight measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by a gas-filled straw-tube transition radiation tracker, which enables track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The transition radiation tracker also provides electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (out of \u223c 35 in total) with an energy deposit above a threshold indicative of transition radiation.",

All of the samples are processed with the Geant4based simulation [16,17] of the ATLAS detector. Dedicated efficiency and calibration studies with data are used to derive correction factors to account for residual differences between experiment and simulation, as is subsequently described. The processes of interest, specifically events containing W \u00b1 or Z bosons, were generated with the Powheg-Box v2 MC program [18] interfaced to the Pythia 8.186 parton shower model [19]. The CT10 PDF set [20] was used in the matrix element, while the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [21] was used with the AZNLO [22] set of generator-parameter values (tune) for the modelling of non-perturbative effects in the initial-state parton shower. The Photos++ v3.52 program [23] was used for QED radiation from electroweak vertices and charged leptons. Samples of top-quark pair (tt) and single-top-quark production were generated with the Powheg-Box v2 generator, which uses NLO matrix element calculations together with the CT10f4 PDF set [24]. Top-quark spin correlations were preserved for all top-quark processes. The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event were simulated using Pythia 6.428 [25] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [26]. The top-quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [27] was used to model bottom and charm hadron decays for all versions of Pythia. Diboson processes were simulated using the Sherpa v2.1.1 generator [28]. They were calculated for up to one (Z Z) or zero (W W , W Z) additional partons at NLO QCD accuracy and up to three additional partons at LO. In addition, the Sherpa diboson sample cross section is scaled to account for the cross section change when the G \u03bc scheme [29] is used instead of the native one for the EW parameters, resulting in an effective value of \u03b1 \u2248 1/132. Multiple overlaid pp collisions were simulated with the soft QCD processes of Pythia v8.186 using the A2 tune [30] and the MSTW2008LO PDF set [31]. For the comparison with data in differential distributions and the evaluation of single-boson EW backgrounds for the crosssection calculations, the single-boson simulations are normalised to the results of NNLO QCD calculations obtained with a modified version of DYNNLO 1.5 [2,3] optimised for speed of computation, with uncertainties of 3%. The simulations of all other processes are normalised to the predictions of NLO QCD calculations, with uncertainties of 10% for the diboson and top-quark processes.",

In this measurement, the hadronic recoil is reconstructed using particle flow objects [37] as inputs. The ATLAS particle flow algorithm provides an improved E miss T resolution compared to the algorithm using only topological clusters, and makes the measurement less sensitive to pile-up by separating the charged-hadron contribution from the neutral hadronic activity [37]. The charged activity is measured by the ID and the related tracks from charged hadrons can be matched to a vertex. From all charged hadrons, only calorimetric clusters associated with a track originating from the reconstructed primary vertex are retained as input to the hadronic recoil algorithm.

Statistical and systematic errors are shown as corresponding bars and shaded bands (not visible for most points). The lower panel shows the ratio of channels to the combined charge asymmetry in each bin. In the lower panel, error bars represent statistical uncertainties in the ratio, while the shaded band represents systematic uncertainties in the combined charge asymmetry G F , the masses and widths of W and Z bosons, and the CKM matrix elements) are taken from Ref. [44]. The DYNNLO predictions are calculated using the NNLO PDF sets from CT14nnlo [45], NNPDF3.1 [46], MMHT14nnlo68cl [47], HERAPDF2.0 [48] and ABMP16 [49]. All considered PDF sets except HERAPDF2.0 are evaluated from global fits which include to varying extents the LHC measurements of W/Z boson, Drell-Yan, top-quark and inclusive jet production. The renormalisation and factorisation scales, respectively denoted as \u03bc r and \u03bc f , are set equal to the decay leptonpair invariant mass, m \u03bd or m . Uncertainties in these predictions are derived as follows. PDF uncertainties are evaluated from the variations of the NNLO PDFs (the PDF uncertainties of CT14nnlo are rescaled from 90% confidence level to 68% confidence level). Scale uncertainties are defined by the envelope of the variations obtained by changing \u03bc r and \u03bc f by a factor of two with respect to their nominal values and imposing 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc r /\u03bc f \u2264 2. The uncertainty induced by the strong coupling constant is estimated by varying \u03b1 S by \u00b10.001 around the central value of \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118, following the prescription of Ref. [45]; the effect of these variations is estimated by comparing the CT14nnlo_as_0117 and CT14nnlo_as_0119 PDF sets to CT14nnlo. Finally, intrinsic limitations of the NNLO calculations for fiducial crosssection predictions lead to systematic differences between results from different programs, as explained in Ref. [50]. Therefore, an additional uncertainty of 0.7%, estimated from a comparison of predictions calculated with Fewz 3.1 and DYNNLO, is assigned. Theory uncertainties are dominated by our knowledge of the proton PDFs.",
