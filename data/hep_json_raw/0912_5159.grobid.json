Exotic strange multibaryon states have been observed in the effective mass spectra of: \u039b\u03c0 \u00b1 ,\u039b\u03b3, \u039bp, \u039bpp subsystems. The mean value of mass for \u03a3 * \u2212 (1385) resonance is shifted till mass of 1370 MeV/c 2 and width is two times larger than the same value from PDG. Such kind of behavior for width and invariant mass of \u03a3 * \u2212 (1385) resonance is interpreted as extensive contribution from stopped \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 and medium effect with invariant mass. The mean value of mass for \u03a3 * + (1385) from secondary interactions is also shifted till mass of 1370 MeV/c 2 . The width of \u03a3 0 is \u2248 2 times larger than the experimental error. There are enhancement production for all observed hyperons.",
