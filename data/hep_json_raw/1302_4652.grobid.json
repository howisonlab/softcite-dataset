However, the absolute strength remains a free parameter of the theory, which for convenience is usually compared at the pole mass of the Z boson. The latest world average is \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1184 \u00b1 0.0007 [1].

This allows for an optimized correction of detector effects and yields a complete correlation matrix, valuable for the inclusion of these data into different QCD fits. The H1 Collaboration used the covariance matrix to normalize the different jet rates to the inclusive neutral-current DIS cross section. This normalization reduces both the experimental and the theoretical uncertainties. The results are shown in figure 1. The cross-section predictions at next-to-leading and leading order were required to agree within 30%, which was fulfilled for 42 out of 65 bins of this measurement, before performing a combined fit of \u03b1 S (M Z ) to the normalized inclusive jet, dijet and trijet data. The result is \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1163 \u00b1 0.0011 (exp.) \u00b1 0.0014 (PDF) \u00b1 0.0008 (hadr.) \u00b1 0.0039 (th.).",

Adding jet data, reduces the correlation between \u03b1 S and the gluon PDF and allows for an in-situ \u03b1 S determination.

In direct photoproduction, the photon directly takes part in the interaction, while the photon acts as a source of partons in events with resolved photoproduction. The latter are rather similar to hadron-hadron collisions since the cross section involves a photon PDF, there will be a photon remnant and the event can be affected by multi-parton interactions. As shown in figure 2, the ZEUS Collaboration published new double-differential jet cross sections in photoproduction events with a centerof-mass energy of the photon-proton system between 142 and 293 GeV [5]. Compared to DIS measurements, this analysis has a relatively high reach of transverse jet energies, E T , up to 80 GeV. Overall, a reasonable agreement between data and the NLO prediction is observed. Discrepancies at low E T and large pseudorapidities, \u03b7, could come from non-perturbative effects, in particular related to multi-parton interaction, or the photon PDF. The impact of the proton PDF uncertainty is in turn much smaller and relevant only at high E T . The ZEUS Collaboration employed these jet cross sections to measure \u03b1 S . The considered range in d\u03c3/dE T was restricted to 21 < E T < 71 GeV in order to reduce potential non-perturbative effects and the impact of the proton PDF uncertainty. Based on the k T jet algorithm, an \u03b1 S (M Z ) of 0.1206 +0.0023 \u22120.0022 (exp.) +0.0042 \u22120.0035 (th.) was obtained. The dominant uncertainties are related to the photon PDF and terms beyond NLO. Results based on the anti-k T and SIScone algorithms are almost identical. ",

For given ranges in jet p T and rapidity, y, these cross sections probe jet production at significantly different x and Q 2 compared to \u221a s = 7 TeV. Despite the small size of the dataset (0.2 pb \u22121 ), the statistical uncertainty on these cross sections at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV is smaller than the total systematic uncertainty. A crucial aspect here is that the jet reconstruction, energy scale and resolution are common to the analyses at 2.76 and  7 TeV, which means that the main systematic uncertainties can be assumed to be fully correlated. This results in drastically reduced uncertainties on cross-sections ratios, \u03c1(p T , y) = \u03c3 2.76 TeV jet (p T , y)/\u03c3 7 TeV jet (p T , y). PDF uncertainties are found to dominate the uncertainty on the prediction for these ratios and to be generally larger than the uncertainty on the measured ratio. The ATLAS Collaboration studied the impact of the jet cross sections at \u221a s = 2.76 and 7 TeV with all their correlations using the HERAFitter framework.

            "text": "The CMS Collaboration has recently performed a measurement of R 32 , the ratio between the inclusive trijet and dijet production rates [17]. Again, both the experimental and the theoretical uncertainties are drastically reduced by taking a cross-section ratio. When selecting jets with p T > 150 GeV, the 2011 dataset allows probing the kinematic region of 250 < p T 1,2 < 1400 GeV, where p T 1,2 is the average p T of the two leading jets in the event. Overall, the measured R 32 is well described by the NLO prediction. Only when using the ABM11 PDF set, the prediction significantly underestimated the data up to p T 1,2 16006-p.3  of 600 GeV. R 32 is proportional to \u03b1 S , as illustrated in figure 5, and it has the advantage of a reduced dependence on assumption for the low-Q 2 evolution made in the PDFs. In order to reduce the impact of uncertainties related to choice and variation of the factorization and renormalization scales, events with p T 1,2 < 400 GeV are neglected when determining the best \u03b1 S in a simultaneous \u03c7 2 fit to the different bins up to p T 1,2 = 1.4 TeV, which yields a logarithmic mean of 764 GeV for the considered range. The result is then evolved downwards in energy to obtain \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1143 \u00b1 0.0064 (exp.) \u00b1 0.0019 (PDF) +0.0050 \u22120.0000 (scale). This result is based on the NNPDF2.1 distribution functions. Compatible results are obtained with CT10 and MSTW2008 PDF sets, while the low gluon density in ABM11 would yield an \u03b1 S (M Z ) larger than 0.1200, which is the upper edge of the \u03b1 S (M Z ) values supported by that PDF group.",

            "text": "Cross sections for jet and multijet production have been measured with high precision at HERA, the Tevatron and the LHC, probing QCD predictions over impressive ranges in x and Q 2 . They provide strong constraints on the gluon PDF at medium to high x, allow measuring \u03b1 S up to the TeV scale already and disentangling gluon PDF and \u03b1 S . Figure 6 compares recent jet-based \u03b1 S (M Z ) results, all of them perfectly compatible with the latest world average but affected by significant theory uncertainties. Given the sizable uncertainties related to choice and variation of factorization and renormalization scales as well as from non-perturbative corrections, all such jet measurements and subsequent extractions of QCD parameters are eagerly awaiting cross-section predictions beyond NLO.",
