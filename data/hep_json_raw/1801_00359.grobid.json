            "text": "Heavy long-lived particles (LLPs) on the order of 100 GeV are not present in the standard model (SM). Therefore, any sign of them would be an indication of new physics. Many extensions of the SM predict the existence of LLPs [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. At the CERN LHC, the LLPs will stop inside the detector material if they lose all of their kinetic energy while traversing the detector, which will typically occur for particles with initial velocities less than about 0.5c [9]. This energy loss can occur via nuclear interactions if they are strongly interacting and/or through ionization if they are charged. The observation of a stopped particle decay JHEP05(2018)127 signature would not only indicate new physics but also help measure the lifetime of LLPs, giving insights into various beyond the standard model (BSM) theories.",

            "text": "If these stopped LLPs have lifetimes longer than tens of nanoseconds, most of their decays would be reconstructed as separate events unrelated to their production [10]. Owing to the difficulty of differentiating between the LLP decay products and SM particles from LHC proton-proton (pp) collisions, these subsequent decays are most easily identified when there are no proton bunches in the detector. The detector is quiet during these out-ofcollision time periods with the exception of rare noncollision backgrounds, such as cosmic rays, beam halo particles, and detector noise. If LLPs come to a stop in the detector, they are most likely to do so in the densest detector materials, which in the CMS detector are the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), the hadron calorimeter (HCAL), and the steel yoke in the muon system. If the stopped LLPs decay in the calorimeters, relatively large energy deposits occurring in the intervals between collisions could be observed. Furthermore, if the stopped LLPs decay into muons, displaced muon tracks out of time with the collisions could be detected.",

One search targets hadronic decays detected in the calorimeters, and the other looks for decays to muon pairs in the muon system. These two search channels are analyzed independently using data collected by the CMS experiment in 2015 and 2016 with separate dedicated triggers. The calorimeter (muon) search uses \u221a s = 13 TeV data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.6 (39.0) fb \u22121 collected with LHC pp collisions separated by 25 ns during a search interval totaling 721 (744) hours. The size of the search sample is further reduced by applying a series of offline selection criteria to decrease the number of events that most likely come from the primary sources of background.",

This search excluded long-lived gluinos ( g) with masses below 880 GeV and long-lived top squarks ( t) with masses below 470 GeV, for lifetimes between 10 \u00b5s and 1000 s. The results of earlier, similar searches have been reported by the D0 collaboration at the Tevatron [12] and by the CMS [13,14] and ATLAS collaborations [15,16]. The displaced muon search is newly added to investigate different models with leptonic decays of stopped LLPs, such as those of gluinos [9] and multiply charged massive particles (MCHAMPs) [17][18][19][20]. Searches for decays of stopped LLPs are complementary to searches for heavy stable charged particles (HSCPs) that pass through the detector and can be identified by their energy loss and timeof-flight (TOF) information [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. The searches presented here would allow the study of the decay of such heavy particles, whereas dedicated HSCP searches typically look for the particle itself, before it decays. However, both the searches for decays of stopped LLPs and for HSCPs are sensitive to a similar range of lifetimes.",

In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5\u00d75 arrays of ECAL crystals to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal pp collision interaction point (IP). For |\u03b7| > 1.74, the coverage of the towers increases progressively to a maximum of 0.174 in \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, which are subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. In the HCAL barrel (HB) and endcap, scintillation light is detected by hybrid photodiodes (HPDs), and each HPD collects signals from 18 different HCAL channels. Signals from four HPDs are then digitized by analog-to-digital converters within a single readout box (RBX).",

Within a train, the proton bunches are nominally spaced 25 ns apart, with a larger spacing between trains to account for the needs of the injection process. In an LHC orbit there are 3564 bunch slots (BXs), which are 25 ns long. Each BX could be filled with proton bunches, which usually occupy the first 2.5 ns of the BX, or could be empty. The trains may be spaced such that there could be multiple empty BXs between filled BXs. To search for LLP decays during these empty BXs, dedicated triggers select events at least two BXs JHEP05 (2018)127away from any proton bunches. Thus these triggers are live only during these specific time windows. This distance of two BXs is chosen so that we maximize the search time window while suppressing most of the events from secondary pp interactions and from \"beam halo\", which are mostly muons traveling outside the LHC beam that are produced by LHC beam-collimator scattering.",

These dedicated cosmic run data were recorded during LHC machine technical stops, several days after collision runs. A negligible amount of long-lived signal produced during collisions could have decayed during these cosmic runs for the lifetimes considered in this analysis.

Long-lived gluinos are predicted by \"split SUSY\" [37,38], in which gauginos have relatively small masses with respect to sfermions, which could be massive, since SUSY is broken at a scale much higher than the weak scale. This large mass splitting causes the long lifetime of the gluinos, since gluinos can only decay via a virtual squark. We also consider the decay of a long-lived top squark ( t \u2192 t \u03c7 0 ) that can be the next-to-LSP particle (NLSP) in various dark matter scenarios [39][40][41].

For the MCHAMP signal, pythia v6.4 is used, while for the gluino and top squark signals, pythia v8.205 is used. If the LLPs are strongly interacting, as in the case of the gluinos and top squarks, they hadronize into R-hadrons [46][47][48] upon production, whose interaction with the CMS detector in the simulation is described by the cloud model [49,50]. In this model, R-hadrons are treated as SUSY particles surrounded by a cloud of loosely bound quarks and gluons. The fraction of produced R-hadrons that contain a gluino and a valence gluon is set to 10%, a convention used in previous analyses [11,21]. However, because the R-hadrons interact an average of ten times in the calorimeter, their flavor is effectively randomized. Some fraction of these R-hadrons are sufficiently slow moving to come to a stop in the detector material. Because they are doubly charged, MCHAMPs ionize heavily and thus a significant number also stop in the detector.",

We exploit this difference to distinguish signal events from cosmic ray muons. While it is possible for the hadronic shower of an R-hadron decay to pass through the first layers of the iron yoke and induce reconstructed DT segments, these DT segments are located only in the inner layers of the muon chambers (r < 560 cm, where r is the transverse distance to the IP) and cluster near the leading jet. On the other hand, cosmic ray muons are equally likely to leave DT segments in all layers in both the upper and lower hemispheres of the muon system, and the angle between the jet and DT segments in \u03c6 is more evenly distributed. As a result, we are able to substantially reduce the cosmic ray muon background contamination in the signal region by rejecting events that have at least two DT segments in the outermost barrel layer of the muon system, events that have any DT segments in the second outermost barrel layer, events that have two DT segments with a large separation in \u03c6 (|\u2206\u03c6| > \u03c0/2), events that have DT segments in the three innermost layers that are separated in \u03c6 from the leading jet by at least 1.0 radian, and events that have close-by RPC hits in different layers (\u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 < 0.2 and \u2206r > 0.5 m). We make looser DT segment requirements in the outermost than in the second outermost layer because signals are very likely to coincide with standalone DT segments that are not from cosmic ray muons but particles from the pp collision. Most of these standalone DT segments from the pp collision are located in the outermost muon barrel layer. With these selection criteria, we are able to avoid incorrectly rejecting signal events, thus increasing the signal efficiency, while still rejecting most of the cosmic ray muon events.",

Thus, the background prediction is: 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 (syst) background events in 2015 data, with a negligible statistical uncertainty, and 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 0.40 (syst) background events in 2016 data.",

This background from two coincident cosmic ray muons could occur if the upper hemisphere DSA track of one cosmic ray muon is reconstructed and if the lower hemisphere DSA track of the other is also reconstructed. We estimate this contribution from data by finding the rate of events with exactly one reconstructed DSA track in one hemisphere satisfying all of the selection criteria except for the \u2206t DT and \u2206t RPC criteria, and no tracks in the other hemisphere. Then, making simple assumptions about when the two coincident cosmic ray muons could occur and about the DSA track reconstruction efficiency as a function of BX, we calculate the number of accidentally coincident cosmic ray muons and find it to be negligible.

Moreover, a study conducted with 2012 data [65] compares the data and simulation for dijets originating from the interaction point. The comparison leads to an estimate of <2% for jets striking the HCAL barrel with angles of incidence from 0 to \u03c0/3. After rescaling the jet energy by 2%, the signal efficiency varies by 2%.

The borders of the regions are determined by the edge of the plateau in figure 2 and the gluino (top squark) mass limits.",

            "text": "A search has been presented for long-lived particles that stopped in the CMS detector after being produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. The subsequent decays of these particles to produce calorimeter deposits or muon pairs were looked for during gaps between proton bunches in the LHC beams. In the calorimeter (muon) search, with collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 (2.8) fb \u22121 in a period of sensitivity corresponding to 135 (155) hours of trigger livetime in 2015 and to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 (36.2) fb \u22121 in a period of sensitivity of 586 (589) hours of trigger livetime in 2016, no excess above the estimated background has been observed. Cross section (\u03c3) and mass limits have been presented at 95% confidence level (CL) on gluino ( g), top squark ( t), and multiply charged massive particle (MCHAMP) production over 13 orders of magnitude in the mean proper lifetime of the stopped particle. Figure 6. The 95% CL upper limits in the neutralino mass vs. gluino (top squark) mass plane, for lifetimes between 10 \u00b5s and 1000 s, for combined 2015 and 2016 data for the calorimeter search. The color map indicates the 95% CL upper limits on B\u03c3. The mostly triangular region defined by the black solid (dashed) line shows the excluded observed (expected) region. We show gluinos that undergo a two-body decay (upper left), top squarks that undergo a two-body decay (upper right), and gluinos that undergo a three-body decay (lower).   In the calorimeter search, combining the results from the 2015 and 2016 analyses and assuming a branching fraction (B) of 100% for g \u2192 g \u03c7 0 ( g \u2192 qq \u03c7 0 ), where \u03c7 0 is the lightest neutralino, gluinos with lifetimes from 10 \u00b5s to 1000 s and m g < 1385 (1393) GeV have been excluded, for a cloud model of R-hadron interactions and for the daughter gluon energy E g > 130 GeV (m g \u2212 m \u03c7 0 160 GeV). Under similar assumptions, for the daughter top quark energy E t > 170 GeV and B( t \u2192 t \u03c7 0 ) = 100%, long-lived top squarks with lifetimes from 10 \u00b5s to 1000 s and m t < 744 GeV have been excluded. These are the first limits on stopped long-lived particles at 13 TeV and the strongest limits to date.",
