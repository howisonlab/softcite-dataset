            "text": "Exotic charmonium-like states have been observed by various experiments over the last 15 years, but their nature is still under discussion. Photo-(muo)production is a new promising instrument to study them. COMPASS, a fixed target experiment at CERN, analyzed the full set of the data collected with a muon beam between 2002 and 2011, covering the range from 7 GeV to 19 GeV in the centre-of-mass energy of the virtual photon-nucleon system. A signal in the mass spectrum of J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the statistical significance of 4.1 \u03c3 was observed in the reaction \u00b5 + N \u2192 \u00b5 + (J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 \u00b1 N . Its mass and width are consistent with those of the X(3872). The shape of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution from the observed decay into J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is different from previous observations for X (3872). The observed signal may be interpreted as possible evidence of a new charmonium state X(3872). It could be associated with a neutral partner of X(3872) with C = \u22121 predicted by a tetraquark model.",

Several interpretations of the new states do exist: pure quarkonia, tetraquarks, hadronic molecules, hybrid mesons with a gluon content, etc. But at the moment many basic parameters of the XYZ states have not been determined yet. New experimental input is required to distinguish between the models that provide different interpretations of the nature of exotic charmonia. The search for exotic charmonium-like states in exclusive photoproduction reactions was for the first time proposed in [1,2,3].",

            "text": "Lepto(photo-)production of exotic charmonia is a new direction in physics of the XYZ states started by COMPASS. A new state X(3872) was observed with the statistical significance of 4.1\u03c3 in the exclusive charge-exchange reaction \u00b5 + N \u2192 \u00b5 + N (J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 \u00b1 . Its mass M X(3872) = 3860.0 \u00b1 10.4 MeV/c 2 , width \u0393 X(3872) < 51 and the decay mode X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are consistent with the X(3872). But the observed two-pion mass spectrum shows disagreement with previous experimental results for the X(3872). A possible explanation could be that the observed state X(3872) is the C = 1 partner of the X(3872) as predicted by a tetraquark model. Estimated rates of photoproduction of exotic charmonia obtained by COMPASS or based on COMPASS results are summarized in Fig. 4  [6,14,12].",
