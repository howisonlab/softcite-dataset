The detector has been in stable data taking in its full configuration from November 2007 to February 2013. In this paper the measurement of the cosmic ray proton plus helium energy spectrum is presented in the region 3-300 TeV by analyzing the full collected data sample.

            "text": "Cosmic rays are ionized nuclei reaching the Earth from outside the solar system. Many experimental efforts have been devoted to the study of cosmic ray properties. In the last decades many experiments were focused on the identification of cosmic ray sources and on the understanding of their acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Despite a very large amount of data collected so far, the origin and propagation of cosmic rays are still under discussion. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are commonly identified as the source of galactic cosmic rays since they could provide the amount of energy needed in order to accelerate particles up to the highest energies in the Galaxy. The measurement of the diffuse gamma-ray radiation in the energy range 1-100 GeV supports these hypotheses on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays [1]. Moreover the TeV gamma-ray emission from SNRs, detected by groundbased experiment, can be related to the acceleration of particles up to \u223c100 TeV [2,3]. A very detailed measurement of the energy spectrum and composition of primary cosmic rays will lead to a deeper knowledge of the acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Since the energy spectrum spans a huge energy interval, experiments dedicated to the study of cosmic ray properties are essentially divided into two broad classes. Direct experiments operating on satellites or balloons are able to measure the energy spectrum and the isotopic composition of cosmic rays on top of the atmosphere. Due to their reduced detector active surface and the limited exposure time the maximum detectable energy is limited up to few TeV. New generation instruments, capable of long balloon flights, have extended the energy measurements up to \u223c100 TeV. All the information concerning cosmic rays above 100 TeV is provided by ground-based air shower experiments. Air shower experiments are able to observe the cascade of particles produced by the interaction between cosmic rays and the Earth's atmosphere. Ground based experiments detect extensive air showers produced by primaries with energies up to 10 20 eV, however they do not allow an easy determination of the abundances of individual elements and the measurement of the composition is therefore limited only to the main elemental groups. Moreover, due to a lack of a model-independent energy calibration, the determination of the primary energy relies on the hadronic interaction model used in the description of the shower's development.",

II, the detector is equipped with a digital and an analog readout systems working independently in order to study the cosmic ray properties in the energy range 1-10 4 TeV, which is one of the main physics goals of the ARGO-YBJ experiment. The high space-time resolution of the digital readout system allows the detection of showers produced by primaries down to few TeV, where balloonborne measurements are available. The analog readout system was designed and built in order to detect showers in a very wide range of particle density at ground level and to explore the cosmic ray spectrum up to the PeV region. In 2012 a first measurement of the cosmic ray proton plus helium (light component) spectrum obtained by analyzing a small sample collected during the first period of data taking with the detector in its full configuration (by using the digital readout information only) has been presented [4].",

China. 4300 m a.s.l.) is a fullcoverage detector made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers (RPCs) with \u223c93% active area [5,6], surrounded by a partially instrumented guard ring designed to improve the event reconstruction. The detector is made of 1836 RPCs, arranged in 153 clusters each made of 12 chambers. The digital readout consists of 18360 pads each segmented in 8 strips. A dedicated procedure was implemented to calibrate the detector in order to achieve high pointing accuracy [7]. The angular and core reconstruction resolution are, respectively, 0.4\u00b0and 5 m for events with at least 500 fired pads [8,9]. The installation of the central carpet was completed in June 2006. The guard ring was completed during spring 2007 and connected to the data acquisition system [10] in November 2007. A simple trigger logic based on the coincidence between the pad signals was implemented. The detector has been in stable data taking in its full configuration for more than five years with a trigger threshold N pad \u00bc 20, corresponding to a trigger rate of about 3.6 kHz and a dead time of 4%. The high granularity and time resolution of the detector provide a detailed threedimensional reconstruction of the shower front. The high altitude location and the segmentation of the experiment offer the possibility to detect showers produced by charged cosmic rays with energies down to few TeV. The digital readout of the pad system allows reconstruction of showers with a particle density at ground level up to about 23 particles=m 2 , which correspond to primaries up to a few hundreds of TeV. In order to extend the detector operating range and investigate energies up to the PeV region each RPC has been equipped with two large size electrodes called big pads [11]. Each big pad provides a signal whose amplitude is proportional to the number of particles impinging the detector surface. The analog readout system allows a detailed measurement of showers with particle density at ground up to more than 10 4 particles=m 2 .",

In this work the analysis of events collected during the period 2008-2012 is presented. Data and simulated events have been selected according to a multistep procedure in order to obtain high quality events and to ensure a reliable and unbiased evaluation of the Bayesian probabilities. The first step concerns the run selection: in order to obtain a sample of high quality runs, the working condition of the detector and the quality of the reconstruction procedure have been analyzed by using the criteria described below (i) At least 128 clusters out of 130 must be active and connected to the DAQ and trigger systems. This criterium selects runs taken with almost the whole apparatus in data taking, discarding the runs that can bias the analysis because of the switched-off clusters. (ii) Only runs with a duration T \u2265 1800 s have been considered. The runs with a short duration are generally produced when a problem in the apparatus occurs. These runs have been removed from the analysis. (iii) The value of the trigger rate for each run must stay within the range 3.2-3.7 kHz. A trigger rate outside this range usually indicates that the detector was not operated standardly. These runs have been discarded. (iv) To monitor the quality of the event reconstruction the mean value of the unnormalized \u03c7 2 obtained by fitting the shower front must be less than 135 ns 2 (see Fig. 1). Nearly all runs that have\u03c7 2 > 135 ns 2 encountered some sort of problems. In Fig. 1 the distribution of the trigger rate and the\u03c7 2 of the reconstruction procedure are reported. The procedure described above selects a data sample of about 3 \u00d7 10 11 events, corresponding to a live time of about 24000 hours.",

This selection criteria based on the lateral particle distribution was introduced in order to discard events produced by nuclei heavier than helium. In fact, in showers induced by heavy primaries the lateral distribution is wider than in light-induced ones. By applying this criterion on events with the core located in a narrow area around the detector center, showers mainly produced by light primaries have been selected. The effect of the density cut has been evaluated in three different energy bands. In the energy region below 10 TeV the efficiency is about 11% for Monte Carlo and the corresponding fraction of data is about 10%.",

The multiplicity distribution extracted from data has been unfolded according to the procedure described in Sec. III A. Results are reported in Fig. 4 for each year of data taking and also for the full sample. In order to investigate the stability of the detector over a long period the analysis was performed separately on the data samples collected during each solar year in the period 2008-2012. The values of the proton plus helium flux measured at 50 TeV are reported in Table I. A power-law fit has been performed on the measured spectrum of each year and of the full data sample, the resulting spectral indices are reported in Table II. Both the spectral indices and the flux values are in very good agreement between them, demonstrating the long-period reliability and the stability of the detector. The spectral index \u03b3 \u00bc \u22122.64 AE 0.01, obtained by analyzing the full data sample, is in good agreement with the one measured by using a smaller data sample collected in the first months of 2008 [4] which was not corrected by the contamination from heavier nuclei (see Sec.

A small data set has also been simulated using the EPOS 1.99 [29] model. These data have been compared with the QGSJET data set used in this analysis. In Fig. 7 the ratio between the multiplicity distributions obtained by using QGSJET model and the one obtained by respectively using SIBYLL and EPOS is reported as a function of primary energy. The plot shows that the variation of the multiplicity distributions obtained with the three hadronic models is of order of a few percents, giving a negligible effect on the measured flux. All these models have a different description of the underlying physics, including the extrapolations of the hadronic cross sections at higher energies. There is therefore an intrinsic systematic uncertainty related to the reliability of the description of the hadronic cross sections at the highest energies.",

            "text": "The ARGO-YBJ experiment was in operation in its full and stable configuration for more than five years: a huge amount of data has been recorded and reconstructed. The peculiar characteristics of the detector, like the full-coverage technique, high altitude operation and high segmentation and spacetime resolution, allow the detection of showers produced by primaries in a wide energy range from a few TeV up to a few hundreds of TeV. Showers detected by ARGO-YBJ in the multiplicity range 150-50000 strips are mainly produced by primaries in the (3-300 TeV) energy range. The relation between the shower size spectrum and the cosmic ray energy spectrum has been established by using an unfolding method based on the Bayes theorem. The unfolding procedure has been performed on the data collected during each year and on the full data sample. The resulting energy spectrum spans the energy range 3-300 TeV, giving a spectral index \u03b3 \u00bc \u22122.64 AE 0.01, which is in very good agreement with the spectral indices obtained by analyzing the sample collected during each year, therefore demonstrating the excellent stability of the detector over a long period. The resulting spectral indices are also in good agreement with the one obtained by analyzing the first data taken with the detector in its full configuration [4]. Special care was devoted to the determination of the uncertainties affecting the measured spectrum. The uncertainty on the results is due to systematic effects of the order of AE5% in the central energy bins. At present this is one of the most accurate measurements of the cosmic ray proton plus helium spectrum in the multi-TeV energy region made by a ground-based air shower experiment. This result reveals the potential of extending this measurement toward the highest energies, where galactic sources should become less efficient in accelerating light elements.",
