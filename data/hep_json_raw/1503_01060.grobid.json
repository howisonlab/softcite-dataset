This paper presents constraints on the off-shell Higgs boson event yields normalised to the Standard Model prediction (signal strength) in the Z Z \u2192 4 , Z Z \u2192 2 2\u03bd and W W \u2192 e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd final states. The result is based on pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 at a collision energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. Using the C L s method, the observed 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limit on the off-shell signal strength is in the range 5.1-8.6, with an expected range of 6.7-11.0. In each case the range is determined by varying the unknown gg \u2192 Z Z and gg \u2192 W W background K-factor from higher-order quantum chromodynamics corrections between half and twice the value of the known signal K-factor. Assuming the relevant Higgs boson couplings are independent of the energy scale of the Higgs boson production, a combination with the on-shell measurements yields an observed (expected) 95 % CL upper limit on H / SM H in the range 4.5-7.5 (6.5-11.2) using the same variations of the background K-factor. Assuming that the unknown gg \u2192 V V background K-factor is equal to the signal K-factor, this translates into an observed (expected) 95 % CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 22.7 (33.0) MeV.",

            "text": "The studies in Refs. [7][8][9][10] have shown that the high-mass off-peak regions beyond 2m V (V = Z , W ), well above the measured resonance mass of about 125 GeV [4,11], in the H \u2192 Z Z and H \u2192 W W channels are sensitive to Higgs boson production through off-shell and background interference effects. This presents a novel way of characterising the properties of the Higgs boson in terms of the off-shell event yields, normalised to the SM prediction (referred to as signal strength \u03bc), and the associated off-shell Higgs boson couplings. Such studies provide sensitivity to new physics that alters the interactions between the Higgs boson and other fundamental particles in the high-mass region [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This approach was used by the CMS Collaboration [19] to set an indirect limit on the Higgs boson total width. The analysis presented in this paper is complementary to direct searches for Higgs boson to invisible decays [20,21] and to constraints coming from the Higgs boson coupling tests [3,4].",

Assuming identical on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson coupling scale factors, the ratio of \u03bc off-shell to \u03bc on-shell provides a measurement of the total width of the Higgs boson. This assumption is particularly relevant to the running of the effective coupling \u03ba g (\u015d) for the loop-induced gg \u2192 H production process, as it is sensitive to new physics that enters at higher mass scales and could be probed in the high-mass m V V signal region of this analysis. More details are given in Refs. [12][13][14][15][16]. With the current sensitivity of the analysis, only an upper limit on the total width H can be determined, for which the weaker assumption",

It is also assumed that any new physics which modifies the off-shell signal strength \u03bc off-shell and the off-shell couplings \u03ba i,off-shell does not modify the predictions for the backgrounds. Further, neither are there sizeable kinematic modifications to the off-shell signal nor new, sizeable signals in the search region of this analysis unrelated to an enhanced off-shell signal strength [18,24]. While higher-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and electroweak (EW) corrections are known for the off-shell signal process gg \u2192 H * \u2192 Z Z [25], which are also applicable to gg \u2192 H * \u2192 W W , no higher-order QCD calculations are available for the gg \u2192 V V background process, which is evaluated at leading order (LO). Therefore the results are given as a function of the unknown K-factor for the gg \u2192 V V background.

The experimental analyses are therefore performed inclusively in jet observables, and the event selections are designed to minimise the dependence on the boost of the V V system, which is sensitive to the jet multiplicity.",

The uncertainty on this calculation is estimated to be about 10 %, which leads to about 30 % uncertainty on the interference alone. Within the ansatz of using an unknown K-factor ratio between background and signal (see Eq. (5)), this additional uncertainty of roughly 30 % on the interference term can be represented by an approximately 60 % variation of the K-factor ratio R B H * for the background around the nominal value of 1.0. Therefore the variation of R B H * from 0.5 to 2.0 should cover both the leading corrections and uncertainties for the interference and the background component taken individually.",

Parton shower Table 2 Uncertainties on the extrapolation of top-quark processes and qq \u2192 W W from their respective CRs to the SR, and from the top CR to the W W CR, from the parton shower and underlying event (UE/PS), from matching the matrix element to the UE/PS model (Gen), from the QCD renormalisation and factorisation scale (scale), and from the PDFs. These uncertainties are used in the W W analysis and derived with the same methods as used in Ref. [ and matrix-element uncertainties are estimated by comparing POWHEG-BOX+PYTHIA8 with POWHEG-BOX+ HERWIG6 and POWHEG-BOX+HERWIG6 with aMC@ NLO [37]+HERWIG6, respectively. PDF uncertainties are estimated by taking the largest difference between the nominal CT10 [60] and either the MSTW2008 [35] or the NNPDF2.1 [61] PDF set and adding this in quadrature with the CT10 error eigenvectors (following the procedure described in Ref. [62]). The extrapolation uncertainties from the W W control region to the signal region are summarised in Table 2. The EW corrections for the qq \u2192 V V process described in Sect. 2.3 are strictly valid only for the LO QCD qq \u2192 V V process above the diboson production threshold when both vector bosons are on shell. This is the case for all three analyses after final selections. The EW corrections are computed at LO QCD because the mixed QCD-EW corrections have not yet been calculated. In events with high QCD activity, an additional systematic uncertainty is considered by studying the variable \u03c1 [47] (here T represents the transverse momentum of the lepton i from vector boson decays). A phase space region with \u03c1 < 0.3 is selected, where the NLO QCD event kinematics resembles the LO event kinematics in being dominated by recoiling vector bosons and therefore the corrections are applicable without additional uncertainty. For events with \u03c1 > 0.3 the correction is applied with a 100 % systematic uncertainty to account for the missing mixed QCD-EW corrections which are expected to be of the same order of magnitude. The applied corrections are partial in that they include only virtual corrections, and do not include polarisation effects. The sum of both of these effects is estimated to be O(1 %) [47] and is neglected in this analysis.",
