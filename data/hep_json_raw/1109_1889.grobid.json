We focus on flavor-changing-neutral-currents (FCNC), which allow neutrino flavor transitions via neutral current interactions, and effects which violate lepton non-universality (NU) and give rise to different neutral-current interaction-amplitudes for different neutrino flavors. We obtain a limit on the FCNC coupling parameter, \u03b5\u00b5\u03c4 , |\u03b5\u00b5\u03c4 | < 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 at 90%C.L. and various constraints on other FCNC parameters as a function of the NU coupling, \u03b5ee. We find no evidence of non-standard neutrino interactions in the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data.",

In 1998 Super-Kamiokande (\"Super-K\") reported an updown asymmetry in the zenith angle distribution of muon-like (\u00b5-like) events and concluded the distortion was evidence for neutrino oscillations [1]. Super-K also observed an oscillation signature consistent with the L/E (pathlength over energy) dependence predicted by \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations at maximal \u03b8 23 mixing [2]. Results consistent with the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillation hypothesis have also been obtained by the tau appearance analysis in Super-K [3] and the long-baseline accelerator experiments K2K [4] and MINOS [5].",

            "text": "Among the many types of NSI models, we focus in this paper on two generic types of neutrino interactions. Flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) effects represent neutrino interactions with fermions, f , in matter that induce neutrino flavor change: \u03bd \u03b1 + f \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 + f , where \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote neutrino flavors. Lepton nonuniversal (NU) interactions, on the other hand, are defined by a non-universal neutral current scattering amplitude among the three flavored neutrinos. In the Standard Model, this amplitude is identical among the neutrinos. Other theorios of neutrino mass, however, predict these kinds of interactions. For instance, NSI interactions are often seen in models where the neutrino mass arises from admixtures of isosinglet neutral heavy leptons [14] or from R-parity violating supersymmetry [15]. A summary of various NSI models is presented in Ref. [16]. Although NSI are predicted by various theories, the expected phenomena do not generally depend on the particular phenomenological model and are typically characterized by dependence on the neutrino energy and the surrounding matter density. For this reason, NSI can be explored in a general context using atmospheric neutrinos. While the current constraints on NSI come from beam-based experiments [31,32], atmospheric neutrinos can provide additional sensitivity to these interactions due to their ample flux and the large amount of matter they traverse before detection.",

As shown in the right panel of Fig. 2, FCNC interactions play a leading role in this energy range because the modified oscillation frequency is comparable in size to the oscillation frequency of these neutrinos in the Earth. Thus, \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 transitions driven by FCNC are expected to occur. In contrast, at these energies NU interactions suppress the effective mixing angle and therefore are expected to produce a sub-leading effect on the data. Note that at the current values of the atmospheric mixing parameters, the standard \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 transition is already increasingly supressed at these energies.

Fig. 3 shows the allowed neutrino oscillation parameter regions, sin 2 2\u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 23 , from this analysis and from the standard oscillation analysis.

As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, FCNC interactions (dashed red curve) increase the effective neutrino oscillation frequency thereby shortening the oscillation length for neutrinos at a fixed energy. Above 30 GeV, where the atmospheric sample is dominated by UPMU events, the oscillation length in the absence of NSI is already greater than the diameter of the Earth. The addition of FCNC effects on the other hand can shorten the oscillation length enough to induce oscillations in the steepest upward-going bins of the UPMU sample. This is an apparent contradiction with the data and results in a tight constraint on \u03b5. Below \u223c 30 GeV, the oscillation length is sufficiently short in both standard and NSI cases to cause oscillations in the FC and PC samples. For this reason it is more difficult for these samples to discriminate between standard-and FCNC-induced oscillations.",

(7). Normalizing by the \u03bd e flux(\u03a6 e ), and disregarding any \u03bd \u00b5 contamination, the resulting e-like distributions can be approximately expressed as P (\u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e ) + rP (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ), where r \u2261 \u03a6 \u00b5 /\u03a6 e is the neutrino flavor ratio [27]. This ratio grows with increasing neutrino energy and though it is highly dependent on the neutrino zenith angle, near the horizon it is \u223c 2 up to around 10 GeV. Thus, if P (\u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e ) + rP (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) 1, as is the case when \u03b5 e\u03c4 and \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 have comparable values, then since P (\u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd e ) is suppressed by \u03b5 e\u03c4 and P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) by \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 , the number of e-like events at the horizon can be expected to decrease. In contrast, the number of e-like events in the upward-going bins would effectively increase because large values of \u03b5 e\u03c4 produce additional \u03bd e from \u03bd \u03c4 created during standard oscillations. This effect is enhanced by the larger flavor ratio in these regions and enables the multi-GeV e-like samples to help constrain \u03b5 e\u03c4 . These effects are shown in the left panel of Fig. 6.",

Fig. 8 shows the allowed NSI parameter regions using four slightly different sets of standard oscillation parameters. The oscillation parameters are taken from the 90% C.L. allowed region from the standard SK 2-flavor analysis. Although slight changes appear when the NSI fits are repeated using these parameters, their minimum \u03c7 2 values are larger than that of the original fit by less than 1.5 units. Therefore no significant change in the allowed parameter regions is expected even if the standard oscillation parameters are allowed to vary during the NSI fit. Finally note that the current allowed regions of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 are constrained more tightly by analyses using the full SK data set, which is larger than the sample used here.  Fig. 9 shows the allowed parameter regions for three subsets of the atmospheric sample. The high energy \u03bd \u00b5rich UPMU throughgoing sample (indicated by the solid curve) and PC+UPMU stopping samples constrain \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 as expected. However, these samples provide no significant contribution to the constraint on \u03b5 e\u03c4 because they lack an e-like component. On the other hand, the FC multi-GeV samples (shown by the dotted curve) include several e-like sub-samples which better constrain \u03b5 e\u03c4 .",

In this section we consider how our limits change when effects from nonzero \u03b8 13 are included in the analysis. Present data suggest that \u03b8 13 is small relative to the other mixing angles, \u03b8 23 and \u03b8 12 . The Chooz experiment has placed the most stringent limit on the parameter, indicating that sin 2 \u03b8 13 < 0.04 [33]. Due to its small size its effects were ignored in the main analysis. However, \u03b8 13 is expected to induce \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e transitions at multi-GeV energies possibly producing an excess of \u03bd e that could be misinterpreted as the effect of \u03b5 e\u03c4 . Here the analysis of section V is repeated for the normal hierarchy, \u2206m 2 23 > 0, and inverted hierarchy, \u2206m 2 23 < 0, with \u03b8 13 fixed at the Chooz limit. Including \u03b8 13 breaks the positive-negative symmetry of \u03b5 e\u03c4 so the fit is expanded to cover both regions. The results of the fit are again presented as a function of \u03b5 ee in Fig. 10.",

The structure of the denominator can create a resonant enhancement of the oscillation probability depending upon the energy of the neutrino and the density of matter it traverses. If \u03b8 13 is nonzero, the upward-going \u03bd e flux is expected to increase in the 2-10 GeV range, coinciding with the region where \u03b5 e\u03c4 can enhance the \u03bd e flux. Accordingly, part of the \u03bd e flux induced by \u03b5 e\u03c4 is now occupied by events from \u03b8 13 transitions which therefore results in a tighter constraint on the parameter. However, the resonance behavior of Eqn.(11) is contingent upon the signs of the mass hierarchy and MSW matter potential. This, coupled with unequal neutrino and antineutrino fluxes in the atmospheric data, results in the asymmetric constraint on \u03b5 e\u03c4 seen in Fig. 10.",
