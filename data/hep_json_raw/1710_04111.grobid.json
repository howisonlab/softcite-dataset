The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.

Only B 0 (s) candidates with p T > 0.5 GeV/c and a small impact parameter \u03c7 2 , \u03c7 2 IP , are considered, where the \u03c7 2 IP of a B 0 (s) candidate is defined as the difference between the \u03c7 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered candidate. The PV with the smallest \u03c7 2 IP is associated to the B 0 (s) candidate. The measured momentum of electron candidates is corrected for the loss of momentum due to bremsstrahlung. This correction is made by adding to the electron the momentum of photons consistent with being emitted from the electron before the magnet [22]. Since bremsstrahlung can affect the kinematic distribution of B 0 (s) \u2192 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 candidates, the sample is split into two categories: candidates in which no photon is associated with the electron and candidates for which one or more photons are recovered. The fraction of electrons with recovered bremsstrahlung photons is about 60% for B 0 (s) \u2192 e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 decays.

Furthermore, the candidates are weighted to emulate the effect of the lepton triggers and the particle identification requirements.

The distribution of the BDT response is also checked on a B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 simulated sample and a uniform distribution is obtained. Candidates with a value smaller than 0.25 are then excluded, as this region is highly contaminated by background, leaving a total of 476 signal candidates.
