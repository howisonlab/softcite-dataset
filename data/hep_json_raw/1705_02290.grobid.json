Such particles are expected to emerge abundantly from the hot interior of stars. To test this prediction, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) uses a 9 T refurbished Large Hadron Collider test magnet directed towards the Sun. In the strong magnetic field, solar axions can be converted to X-ray photons which can be recorded by X-ray detectors. In the 2013-2015 run, thanks  to low-background detectors and a new X-ray telescope, the signal-to-noise ratio was increased by about a factor of three. Here, we report the best limit on the axion-photon coupling strength (0.66 \u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 at 95% confidence level) set by CAST, which now reaches similar levels to the most restrictive astrophysical bounds.",

Nearly massless pseudoscalar bosons, often generically called axions, are particularly promising because they appear in many extensions of the standard model. They can be dark matter in the form of classical field oscillations that were excited in the early universe, notably by the re-alignment mechanism 3 . One particularly well motivated case is the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion, the eponym for all such particles. The existence of this new lowmass boson follows from the Peccei-Quinn mechanism as an explanation why QCD is perfectly time-reversal invariant within current experimental precision 3 .",

Independently of the dark-matter assumption, one can search for new forces mediated by these low-mass bosons 5 or the back-reaction on spinning black holes (superradiance) 6 .

            "text": "In the latest data-taking campaign (2013-2015), CAST has returned to evacuated pipes, with an improvement in the sensitivity to solar axions of about a factor of three in signal-tonoise ratio over a decade ago, thanks to the development of novel detection systems-notably new Micromegas detectors with lower background levels, as well as a new XRT built specifically for axion searches. These developments are also part of the activities to define the detection technologies suitable for the proposed much larger next-generation axion helioscope IAXO 28 . We here report the results of this effort in CAST.  Figure 1 | Sketch of the CAST helioscope at CERN to search for solar axions. These hypothetical low-mass bosons are produced in the Sun by Primako scattering on charged particles and converted back to X-rays by the same process in the B-field of an LHC test magnet. The two straight conversion pipes have a cross-section of 14.5 cm 2 each. The magnet can move by \u00b18 \u2022 vertically and \u00b140 \u2022 horizontally, enough to follow the Sun for about 1.5 h at dawn and dusk with each end of the magnet, where separate detection systems can search for axions at sunrise and sunset, respectively. The sunrise system is equipped with an X-ray telescope (XRT) to focus the signal on a small detector area, strongly increasing signal to noise. Our new results were achieved thanks to an XRT specifically built for CAST and improved low-noise X-ray detectors. a movable platform (\u00b18 \u2022 vertical and \u00b140 \u2022 horizontal movement), allowing it to follow the Sun for about 1.5 h both at sunrise and sunset during the whole year. The pointing accuracy of the system is monitored to be well below 10% of the solar radius, both by periodic geometric surveys, as well as, twice per year, by filming the Sun with an optical telescope and camera attached to the magnet, and whose optical axis has been set parallel to it. The effect of refraction in the atmosphere, relevant for photons, but not for axions, is properly taken into account. At both ends of the magnet, different X-ray detectors have been searching for photons coming from axion conversion inside the magnet when it is pointing to the Sun. During non-tracking time, calibrations are performed and detectors record background data. The data presented here were taken with three detection systems. On the sunset (SS) side of the magnet, two gas-based lowbackground detectors (SS1 and SS2) read by Micromegas planes 30 , were directly connected to each of the magnet pipes. On the sunrise (SR) side of the magnet, an improved Micromegas detector was situated at the focal plane of the new XRT. The detectors were small gaseous time projection chambers of 3 cm drift and were filled with a 1.4 bar argon-2% isobutane mixture. Their cathodes were 4-\u00b5mthick mylar windows that face the magnet pipe vacuum and hold the pressure difference while being transparent to X-rays. The detector parts were built with carefully selected low-radioactivity materials, and surrounded by passive (copper and lead) and active (5-cmthick plastic scintillators) shielding. The Micromegas readouts were built with the microbulk technique 31 , out of copper and kapton, and were patterned with 500 \u00b5m pixels interconnected in the x and y directions 32 . These design choices are the outcome of a longstanding effort to understand and reduce background sources in these detectors 33,34 . This effort has led to the best background levels (\u223c10 \u22126 keV \u22121 cm \u22122 s \u22121 ) ever obtained in CAST.",

            "text": "The XRT installed in the SR system was a telescope (of focal length 1.5 m) that follows a cone-approximation Wolter I design. It is comprised of thermally formed glass substrates deposited with Pt/C multilayers to enhance X-ray reflectivity in the 0.5-10 keV band. The techniques and infrastructure used in fabricating the CAST XRT were originally developed 35 to make the two hard X-ray telescopes that are flying on NASA's NuSTAR satellite 36 . The optical prescription and multilayer coatings were optimized when considering factors including: the physical constraints of the CAST experiment; the predicted axion spectrum; and the quantum efficiency of the Micromegas detector 37 . The point spread function (PSF) and effective area (that is, throughput) of the XRT were calibrated at the PANTER X-ray test facility at MPE in Munich in July 2016. These calibration data were incorporated into Monte Carlo geometric ray-trace simulations to determine the expected two-dimensional (2D) distribution of solar axion-induced photons, which is shown in Fig. 3. Although there is a slight energy dependence on the PSF (the XRT focuses better at higher X-ray energy), more than 50% of the flux is always concentrated in an area of a few mm 2 , effectively reducing the background to levels down to \u223c0.003 counts h \u22121 . In addition, the combined XRT and detector system was regularly calibrated in CAST using an X-ray source placed \u223c12 m away from the optics (at the SS side of the magnet). One such calibration is shown in Fig. 3, together with the expected 2D distribution from the ray-trace simulation. These contours are different from the ones expected from axion-induced photons (shown in Fig. 3) due to the different angular size and distance of the source. The agreement between data and simulations confirms our good understanding of the optics performance. This is the first time an XRT has been designed and built specifically for axion physics and operated together with a Micromegas detector at  Table 1). The calibration is performed with an X-ray source placed \u223c12 m away (at the sunset side of the magnet). The contours in the calibration run represent the 95%, 85% and 68% signal-encircling regions from ray-trace simulations, taking into account the source size and distance. In the tracking and background plots, grey full circles represent events that pass all detector cuts but that are in coincidence with the muon vetoes, and therefore rejected. Black open circles represent final counts. Closed contours indicate the 99%, 95%, 85% and 68% signal-encircling regions out of detailed ray-trace simulations of the XRT plus spatial resolution of the detector. The large circle represents the region of detector exposed to daily energy calibration. Note that for rows K and L background levels are expressed in units of total counts in the (95% signal-enclosing) spot area during the corresponding tracking exposure.",

In 2013, only SS detectors were operative, while in 2014 and 2015 both the SS detectors and the new SR system, installed in CAST in September 2014, took data. The data are divided in sets as shown in Table 1, according to detector and the year of the data-taking campaign. The 2015 SS detectors data are further divided into three sets (E, F, G and H, I, J for SS1 and SS2 detectors respectively) due to an accidental variation in the detector configuration: one of the muon vetoes remained inoperative for about one month, leading to a different background rate during that period. Background levels are defined independently for every data set using data acquired during non-tracking periods. These data typically have \u223c10 times more exposure than tracking data, and consequently background levels have \u223c3 times smaller statistical error bars. Data shown in the tables and figures always refer to levels after processing. Raw data from the Micromegas detectors undergo an offline filtering process, detailed elsewhere 32 , based on topological information of the event (for example, number of ionization clusters recorded in the chamber, or longitudinal and transversal spread of the signal), to keep only signal-like (that is, X-ray-like) events. The effect of this filtering on raw background levels at low energies is about a factor of 100, while the signal efficiency stays at 60-70%, depending on the event energy, as determined experimentally by careful calibrations with an X-ray tube at different representative energies 38 . In addition, an anti-coincidence condition with the external plastic muon vetoes is applied, leading to an additional rejection factor of \u223c2 (see Fig. 3).",

All these contributions have been estimated to be negligible in the final result, which is dominated by the statistical error of the low-counting observation. Overall systematic effects are well below 10% of the quoted result. It is worth noting that the observation of the SR counts represents a statistical fluctuation that slightly worsens the final result with respect to the expected sensitivity (defined as the average exclusion of an ensemble of possible statistical outcomes under the background-only hypothesis), estimated as g 10,average 0.64.",

It is shown in the wider m a -g a\u03b3 landscape in Fig. 6. In particular, axions and photons can also interconvert in astrophysical B fields that tend to be much weaker than in CAST, but extend over much larger distances. For example, the non-observation of \u03b3 rays contemporaneous with the SN 1987A neutrino signal provides a limit g 10 0.053 for m a 0.44 neV (ref. 39). This conversion effect could be important also for other astrophysical and cosmological sources, especially for the propagation of TeV \u03b3 rays and as an explanation for the soft X-ray excess in galaxy clusters (for a recent review see ref. 40). In the very low mass domain, propagation experiments for laser beams in magnetic fields have also explored the g a\u03b3 -m a parameter space 41,42 . Helioscopes using the Bragg technique can reach larger axion masses than CAST because the electric fields in the crystals are inhomogeneous on much smaller scales. Yet because of their limited size, even the best case shown in Fig. 6 from DAMA 19 is not competitive. In the future, CUORE may reach values of g a\u03b3 comparable to the CAST 3 He limits near m a \u223c 1 eV, but extended to larger masses 43 .",
