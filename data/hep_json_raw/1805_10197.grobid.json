Cross sections are obtained from measured H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4^ event yields, which are combined taking into account detector efficiencies, resolution, acceptances and branching fractions. The total Higgs boson production cross section is measured to be 57.0+6 5. .9 0 (stat.) +4 3. .0 3 (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Differential cross section measurements are presented for the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution, Higgs boson rapidity, number of jets produced together with the Higgs boson, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The results from the two decay channels are found to be compatible, and their combination agrees with the Standard Model predictions.",

The combined cross section is extracted for the total phase space, increasing the degree of model depen dence compared to the individual measurements, which were per formed in a fiducial phase space close to the selection criteria for reconstructed events in the detector. Despite the additional sys tematic uncertainties assigned to the extrapolation to the total phase space, the combination significantly reduces the measure ment uncertainty compared to the results in the individual decay channels.",

            "text": "The effect of PDF uncertainties on tt\u00af H and bb\u00af H is negligible and not included. The renormalization and fac torization scales are varied by factors of 2.0 and 0.5. For NNLOPS, instead of the internal scale uncertainties, the same scheme as in Refs.[11,12,78] is used: four parameters account for uncertainties in the cross sections for events with different jet multiplicities[14,75,76,79], and three parameters account for the uncertainties in the modelling of the pT H distributions.The predicted Higgs boson decay branching ratios are (0.227 \u00b1 0.007)% and (0.0125 \u00b1 0.0003)% for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4^ decays, respectively[14]. Both branching ratio calcu lations include the complete NLO QCD and EW corrections. For H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4^, the interference effects between identical final state fermion pairs are included. The correlations of the branching ratio uncertainties and the dependence of the predicted branch ing ratios on the Higgs boson mass are taken into account in the combination. For the H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4^ decay channel, which has the larger dependence, this corresponds to a relative variation of \u223c2% in the branching ratio when varying the assumed Higgs bo son mass by \u00b10.24 GeV[15].",
