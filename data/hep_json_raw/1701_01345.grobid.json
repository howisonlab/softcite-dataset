No excess of events over the standard model background expectation is observed. Upper limits for a benchmark model on the product of cross section and branching fraction for the production of these heavy narrow resonances are presented. The limit excludes leptophobic Z bosons with masses below 2.5 TeV within the benchmark model. This is the first result to constrain a leptophobic Z resonance in the four-lepton channel.",

            "text": "Extensions of the standard model (SM) that incorporate one or more extra Abelian gauge groups predict the existence of one or more neutral gauge bosons [1,2]. These occur naturally in most grand unified theories. Heavy neutral bosons are also predicted in models with extra spatial dimensions [3,4], e.g. Randall-Sundrum models [5,6], where these resonances may arise from Kaluza-Klein excitations of a graviton. Searches for heavy neutral resonances at hadron colliders, and most recently at the CERN LHC, are typically performed using the dijet [7][8][9][10], dilepton [11][12][13][14], diphoton [15][16][17], diboson [18][19][20][21][22][23][24], and tt [25][26][27][28] final states. The dilepton channel provides a clean signal compared with the dijet and tt channels. However, in leptophobic Z models, where the Z does not couple to SM leptons, the dilepton limits are not applicable. Although searches based on the dijet final state remain applicable, they suffer from large dijet background produced by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) subprocesses. We extend the search for heavy neutral vector bosons by considering possible Z decays into new particles predicted by various theoretical extensions of the SM.",

[29]. In this model, the Z is coupled to quark pairs but not to lepton pairs, and can be produced with a large cross section at the LHC. These non-standard Z resonances also decay to pairs of new scalar bosons (\u03d5) each of which subsequently decays to pairs of leptons (\u03d5 \u2192 , where and = e or \u03bc). Fig. 1 shows the leading-order Feynman diagram for the production of four-lepton final states via a Z resonance at a hadron collider. The reconstruction of the \u03d5 bosons in the dilepton channel is inefficient if the difference between Z and \u03d5 masses is large and the two daughter leptons are consequently highly collimated. In the following sections we describe a technique to increase the selection efficiency.",

These samples are divided into five decay channels (\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc, \u03bc\u03bc\u03bce, \u03bc\u03bcee, \u03bceee, eeee) for different Z boson masses (m Z ) ranging from 250 to 3000 GeV in increments of 250 GeV. The benchmark model assumes that new particles other than Z and \u03d5 are heavy enough not to affect the production and decay of the Z boson. Signal MC samples are produced with six different values of the \u03d5 mass (m \u03d5 ), with m \u03d5 = 50 GeV used as the reference mass value in the interpretation of the results. An important feature of this analysis is the presence of a \"boosted signature\" associated with the collimation of the two leptons coming from the same parent particle and resulting from the large difference between m Z and m \u03d5 . In addition, samples are generated with m \u03d5 masses of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40% of m Z , for which, in most cases, the contribution from the boosted signature is less important. The product of the leading order (LO) signal cross section and branching fraction in each channel varies with m Z (from 250 to 3000 GeV) as follows: \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc and eeee from 0.8 pb to 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 pb, \u03bc\u03bcee from 12.3 pb to 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 pb, and \u03bc\u03bc\u03bce and \u03bceee from 3.1 pb to 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 pb. The branching fraction of \u03d5 \u2192 is set to 1 and therefore only the leptonic decay channels are considered. These signal MC samples are used to optimize event selection, evaluate signal efficiencies and calculate exclusion limits.",

A Bayesian approach is adopted with a likelihood function defined with a signal strength modifier, a prior probability, and a set of nuisance parameters. The prior probability distribution for the signal cross section is positive and uniform, since this is known to result in good frequentist coverage properties. The systematic uncertainties associated with the backgrounds, selection efficiency and luminosity are treated as nuisance parameters with log-normal prior distributions [48]. A limit on the signal contribution is derived by interpreting the likelihood function as a probability distribution and integrating over this. The coverage of the 95% CL assigned to the limit has been checked using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. ",

The uncertainty in the MC estimation of the main background cross section (ZZ and tt) arising from higher-order QCD corrections and choice of PDFs is 15%. In order to be conservative, we choose to double this figure and assign an uncertainty of 30% from this source. The systematic uncertainty in the muon selection efficiency including reconstruction, identification, and isolation is 0.5% [33]. The uncertainties in the electron selection efficiency are 0.7% (0.6%) for electrons below 100 GeV in EB (EE) and 1.4% (0.4%) for electrons above 100 GeV in EB (EE) [13]. The uncertainties due to the lepton efficiency in both signal and background yields vary between 2.2% and 2.7% as a function of m 4 . Including the effect of the merged lepton signature, a total uncertainty of 10% in the event selection efficiency is assigned for each channel. The impact of the uncertainty in the electron energy scale on signal (background) yield is 1% (0.5%) [13]. Uncertainties in the muon momentum scale and mass resolutions are below 0.1% [33]. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is assigned to be 2.6% [49]. In this analysis, the statistical uncertainties are dominant and the systematic uncertainties have a small impact on the results. We tested the robustness of the limits by doubling the values assumed for the systematic uncertainties. We observed a negligible change in the calculated limits, and conclude that the limits are insensitive to any underestimation of the systematic uncertainties.",

In the limit calculation, we set the mass window to be six times the mass resolution centred around the signal mass point considered. A counting experiment is performed for the limit calculation. Fig. 3 shows the upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction, for the combination of all five channels, for the mass range considered in the benchmark model of Ref. [29]. In the framework of this model, we translate these cross section upper limits into lower limits on the Z boson mass. For the combination of the five channels, the value obtained for this lower mass limit is 2.5 TeV. The black solid (dashed) line indicates the observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits, the inner (outer) band indicates the \u00b11 (2) standard deviation uncertainty in the expected limits, and the blue dashed line shows the theoretical Z cross section for m \u03d5 = 50 GeV. This theoretical cross section is calculated under the benchmark model assumption that the branching fraction  B(\u03d5 \u2192 ) = 100%. In the region above the 1-1.5 TeV, the bands are not visible since backgrounds are negligible here. Table 2 shows the exclusion limit on m Z for the five separate channels and for the combination. Results are presented for the benchmark assumption m \u03d5 = 50 GeV, and for the five different values of the ratio m \u03d5 /m Z assumed for the generated signal samples, taking into account the event selection efficiencies described above. The predicted cross sections decrease as the ratio m \u03d5 /m Z increases. The contribution of the merged lepton signature also decreases, resulting in an overall efficiency increase. Therefore the scenarios with m \u03d5 /m Z = 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40% of m Z , give slightly higher limits than the m \u03d5 = 50 GeV scenario.",
