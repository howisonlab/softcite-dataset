The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 acquired with the LHCb detector from 7 and 8 TeV pp collisions. An amplitude analysis of the three-body final state reproduces the two-body mass and angular distributions. To obtain a satisfactory fit of the structures seen in the J=\u03c8p mass spectrum, it is necessary to include two Breit-Wigner amplitudes that each describe a resonant state. The significance of each of these resonances is more than 9 standard deviations. One has a mass of 4380 AE 8 AE 29 MeV and a width of 205 AE 18 AE 86 MeV, while the second is narrower, with a mass of 4449.8 AE 1.7 AE 2.5 MeV and a width of 39 AE 5 AE 19 MeV. The preferred J P assignments are of opposite parity, with one state having spin 3=2 and the other 5=2.",

            "text": "Introduction and summary.-The prospect of hadrons with more than the minimal quark content (qq or qqq) was proposed by Gell-Mann in 1964 [1] and Zweig [2], followed by a quantitative model for two quarks plus two antiquarks developed by Jaffe in 1976 [3]. The idea was expanded upon [4] to include baryons composed of four quarks plus one antiquark; the name pentaquark was coined by Lipkin [5]. Past claimed observations of pentaquark states have been shown to be spurious [6], although there is at least one viable tetraquark candidate, the Z\u00f04430\u00de \u00fe observed inB 0 \u2192 \u03c8 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe decays [7][8][9], implying that the existence of pentaquark baryon states would not be surprising. States that decay into charmonium may have particularly distinctive signatures [10].",

First, we tried to fit the data with an amplitude model that contains 14 \u039b \u00c3 states listed by the Particle Data Group [12]. As this did not give a satisfactory description of the data, we added one P \u00fe c state, and when that was not sufficient we included a second state. The two P \u00fe c states are found to have masses of 4380 AE 8 AE 29 MeV and 4449.8 AE 1.7 AE 2.5 MeV, with corresponding widths of 205 AE 18 AE 86 MeV and 39 AE 5 AE 19 MeV. (Natural units are used throughout this Letter. Whenever two uncertainties are quoted, the first is statistical and the second systematic.) The fractions of the total sample due to the lower mass and higher mass states are \u00f08.4 AE 0.7 AE 4.2\u00de% and \u00f04.1 AE 0.5 AE 1.1\u00de%, respectively. The best fit solution has spin-parity J P values of (3=2 \u2212 , 5=2 \u00fe ). Acceptable solutions are also found for additional cases with opposite parity, either (3=2 \u00fe , 5=2 \u2212 ) or (5=2 \u00fe , 3=2 \u2212 ). The best fit projections are shown in Fig. 3. Both m Kp and the peaking structure in m J=\u03c8p are reproduced by the fit. The significances of the lower mass and higher mass states are 9 and 12 standard deviations, respectively. Analysis and results.-We use data corresponding to 1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity acquired by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy, and 2 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV. The LHCb detector [13] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range, 2 < \u03b7 < 5. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [14], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [15] placed downstream of the magnet. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [16]. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [17].",

This is accomplished by removing combinations that when interpreted as J=\u03c8K \u00fe K \u2212 fall within AE30 MeV of theB 0 s mass or when interpreted as J=\u03c8K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe fall within AE30 MeV of theB 0 mass. This requirement effectively eliminates background from these sources and causes only smooth changes in the detection efficiencies across the \u039b 0 b decay phase space. Backgrounds from \u039e b decays cannot contribute significantly to our sample. We choose a relatively tight cut on the BDTG output variable that leaves 26 007 AE 166 signal candidates containing 5.4% background within AE15 MeV (AE2\u03c3) of the J=\u03c8K \u2212 p mass peak, as determined by the unbinned extended likelihood fit shown in Fig. 4. The combinatorial background is modeled with an exponential function and the \u039b 0 b signal shape is parametrized by a double-sided Hypatia function [25], where the signal radiative tail parameters are fixed to values obtained from simulation. For subsequent analysis we constrain the J=\u03c8K \u2212 p fourvectors to give the \u039b 0 b invariant mass and the \u039b 0 b momentum vector to be aligned with the measured direction from the primary to the \u039b 0 b vertices [26]. In Fig. 5 we show the \"Dalitz\" plot [27] using the K \u2212 p and J=\u03c8p invariant masses-squared as independent variables. A distinct vertical band is observed in the K \u2212 p invariant mass distribution near 2.3 GeV 2 corresponding to the \u039b\u00f01520\u00de resonance. There is also a distinct horizontal band near 19.5 GeV 2 . As we see structures in both K \u2212 p and J=\u03c8p mass distributions we perform a full amplitude analysis, using the available angular variables in addition to the mass distributions, in order to determine the resonances present. No structure is seen in the J=\u03c8K \u2212 invariant mass.",

The difference of \u22122 ln L\u00f0\u03c9 min \u00de between different amplitude models, \u0394\u00f0\u22122 ln L\u00de, allows their discrimination. For two models representing separate hypotheses, e.g., when discriminating between different J P values assigned to a P \u00fe c state, the assumption of a \u03c7 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom for \u0394\u00f0\u22122 ln L\u00de under the disfavored J P hypothesis allows the calculation of a lower limit on the significance of its rejection, i.e., the p value [33]. Therefore, it is convenient to express \u0394\u00f0\u22122 ln L\u00de values as n 2 \u03c3 , where n \u03c3 corresponds to the number of standard deviations in the normal distribution with the same p value. For nested hypotheses, e.g., when discriminating between models without and with P \u00fe c states, n \u03c3 overestimates the p value by a modest amount. Simulations are used to obtain better estimates of the significance of the P \u00fe c states. Since the isospin of both the \u039b 0 b and the J=\u03c8 particles are zero, we expect that the dominant contributions in the K \u2212 p system are \u039b \u00c3 states, which would be produced via a \u0394I \u00bc 0 process. It is also possible that \u03a3 \u00c3 resonances contribute, but these would have \u0394I \u00bc 1. By analogy with kaon decays the \u0394I \u00bc 0 process should be dominant [34].

In the amplitude fits discussed above, the P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe is represented by a Breit-Wigner amplitude, where the magnitude and phase vary with m J=\u03c8p according to an approximately circular trajectory in the (ReA P c , ImA P c ) plane, where A P c is the m J=\u03c8p dependent part of the P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe amplitude. We perform an additional fit to the data using the reduced \u039b \u00c3 model, in which we represent the P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe amplitude as the combination of independent complex amplitudes at six equidistant points in the range AE\u0393 0 \u00bc 39 MeV around M 0 \u00bc 4449.8 MeV as determined in the default fit. Real and imaginary parts of the amplitude are interpolated in the mass interval between the fitted points. The resulting Argand diagram, shown in Fig. 9(a), is consistent with a rapid counterclockwise change of the P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe phase when its magnitude reaches the maximum, a behavior characteristic of a resonance. A similar study for the wider state is shown in Fig. 9(b); although the fit does show a large phase change, the amplitude values are sensitive to the details of the \u039b \u00c3 model and so this latter study is not conclusive.",

The data cannot be satisfactorily described without including two Breit-Wigner shaped resonances in the J=\u03c8p invariant mass distribution. The significances of the lower mass and higher mass states are 9 and 12 standard deviations, respectively. These structures cannot be accounted for by reflections from J=\u03c8\u039b \u00c3 resonances or other known sources. Interpreted as resonant states they must have minimal quark content of ccuud, and would therefore be called charmonium-pentaquark states. The lighter state P c \u00f04380\u00de \u00fe has a mass of 4380AE8AE29 MeV and a width of 205 AE 18 AE 86 MeV, while the heavier state P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe has a mass of 4449.8 AE 1.7 AE 2.5 MeV and a width of 39 AE 5 AE 19 MeV. A model-independent representation of the P c \u00f04450\u00de \u00fe contribution in the fit shows a phase change in amplitude consistent with that of a resonance. The parities of the two states are opposite with the preferred spins being 3=2 for one state and 5=2 for the other. The higher mass state has a fit fraction of \u00f04.1 AE 0.5 AE 1.1\u00de%, and the lower mass state of \u00f08.4 AE 0.7 AE 4.2\u00de%, of the total \u039b 0 b \u2192 J=\u03c8K \u2212 p sample.
