K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions are formed in 3 multiplicity \u00d7 4 k T bins. The femtoscopic kaon source parameters R inv and \u03bb are extracted from these correlation functions by fitting a femtoscopy \u00d7 PYTHIA model to them, PYTHIA accounting for the non-flat baseline found in pp collisions. Source parameters are obtained from a fit which includes quantum statistics and final-state interactions of the a 0 /f 0 resonance. K 0 s K 0 s correlations show a systematic increase in R inv for increasing multiplicity bin and decreasing R inv for increasing k T bin as seen in \u03c0\u03c0 correlations in the pp system, as well as seen in heavy-ion collisions. Also, K 0 s K 0 s correlations are observed to smoothly extend this \u03c0\u03c0 R inv behavior for the pp system up to about three times higher k T than the k T range measured in \u03c0\u03c0 correlations.",

The main motivations to carry out K 0 s K 0 s femtoscopic studies to augment the usual identical charged \u03c0\u03c0 femtoscopic studies are 1) to extend the k T range of the charged \u03c0\u03c0 studies, 2) since K 0 s is uncharged, it is not necessary to apply a final-state Coulomb correction to the pairs as is necessary for charged \u03c0\u03c0 pairs, and 3) one can in principle obtain complementary information about the collision interaction region by using different types of mesons. Previous K 0 s K 0 s studies have been carried out in LEP e + e \u2212 collisions [2,3,4], HERA ep collisions [5] and RHIC Au-Au collisions [6]. Due to statistics limitations, a single set of femtoscopic source parameters, i.e. R inv and \u03bb, was extracted in each of these studies. To our knowledge, the present study is the first femtoscopic K 0 s K 0 s study to be carried out a) in pp collisions and b) in more than one multiplicity and k T bin.",

Figure  1 shows an invariant mass plot of candidate K 0 s vertices for all event multiplicities and k T along with a Gaussian + quadratic fit to the data. A vertex was identified with a K 0 s if the invariant mass of the candidate \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair associated with it fell in the  range 0.490-0.504 GeV/c 2 . As seen in Figure 1, the K 0 s purity in this case is found to be 96%. K 0 s purities of similar values are also found in the other multiplicity and k T bins used in this study. Figure 2 shows a K 0 s K 0 s correlation function in the invariant momentum difference variable Q inv = Q 2 \u2212 Q 2 0 , where Q and Q 0 are the 3-momentum and energy differences between the two particles respectively, for all multiplicity and k T . The three main features seen in this correlation function are 1) a well-defined enhancement region for Q inv < 0.3 GeV/c, 2) a non-flat baseline for Q inv > 0.3 GeV/c and 3) a small peak at Q inv \u2248 1.15 GeV/c.

Comparing with the Particle Data Group meson table [7], this peak is a good candidate for the f \u2032 2 (1525) meson. This would be the first observation of the decay of this meson into the K 0 s K 0 s channel in pp collisions. In order to disentangle the non-flat baseline from the low-Q inv femtoscopic enhancement, PYTHIA [8] was used to model the baseline. Both Gaussian and quadratic fits were made to PYTHIA-generated K 0 s K 0 s correlation functions for each multiplicity-k T bin studied, and these fits were then used to define the baseline in fitting the femtoscopic function to the experimental correlation functions. PYTHIA with the Perugia-0 tune [9] is found to describe reasonably well the dependence of the baseline shape of the K 0 s K 0 s correlation function on multiplicity-k T bin in the Q inv fitting range used of 0-1 GeV/c. Using both the Gaussian and quadratic PYTHIA fits helped to define the systematic error of this approach, as well as adding to the systematic error estimate a \u00b110% uncertainty in the fit parameters due to the uncertainty in using PYTHIA to estimate the baseline.",

The femtoscopic variables R inv and \u03bb were extracted in each bin by fitting the experimental correlation function divided by the PYTHIA baseline shape by the Lednicky parameterization [6] based on the model by R. Lednicky and V.L. Lyuboshitz [10]. This model takes into account both quantum statistics and strong final-state interactions from the a 0 /f 0 resonance which occur between the K 0 s K 0 s pair. The K 0 s spacial distribution is assumed to be Gaussian with a width R inv in the parameterization and so its influence on the correlation function is from both the quantum statistics and the strong final-state interaction. This is the same parameterization as was used by the RHIC STAR collaboration to extract R inv and \u03bb from their K 0 s K 0 s study of Au-Au collisions [6]. Figure 3 shows a sample experimental K 0 s K 0 s correlation function divided by the PYTHIA quadratic baseline fit for the multiplicity 1-11 and k T 0.4-0.8 GeV/c bin. Also shown are fits with the Lednicky parameterization and for comparison a usual Gaussian model. As seen, the R inv and \u03bb parameters from the Lednicky fit are \u223c 30% and \u223c 50% smaller, respectively, than those extracted from the Gaussian model fit. The RHIC STAR experiment saw \u223c 20% reductions in these parameters in Au-Au collisions compared with a Gaussian model fit [6], the smaller effect being expected for a larger K 0 s source size since the strong final-state interactions are reduced in that case by geometry [10].",

The k T dependence of \u03bb is seen in Figure 4 to be mostly flat with \u03bb lying at an average level of \u223c 0.5 \u2212 0.6, similar to that found in the ALICE \u03c0\u03c0 results for 7 TeV pp collisions [11].

Also shown for comparison are R inv parameters extracted in the same event multiplicity bins from a \u03c0\u03c0 femtoscopic study by ALICE [11] in 7 TeV pp collisions.

Comparing with \u03c0\u03c0, the K 0 s K 0 s results for R inv extend the covered range of k T to \u223c 2 GeV/c, which is about three times larger than for \u03c0\u03c0.
