The analysis uses a sample of 7 TeV pp collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 , recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The observed forward energy depositions, their correlations, and the central charged-particle multiplicities are not well described by the available non-diffractive soft-hadron production models. A study of about 300 events with no significant energy deposited in one of the forward calorimeters, corresponding to a pseudorapidity gap of at least 1.9 units, is also presented. An indication for a diffractive component in these events comes from the observation that the majority of the charged leptons from the W(Z) decays are found in the hemisphere opposite to the gap. When fitting the signed lepton pseudorapidity distribution of these events with predicted distributions from an admixture of diffractive (POMPYT) and non-diffractive (PYTHIA) Monte Carlo simulations, the diffractive component is determined to be (50.0 \u00b1 9.3 (stat.) \u00b1 5.2 (syst.))%.",

Hard-diffractive events, with Fig. 1 Sketches of the process pp \u2192 W(Z)X, where a W(Z) boson is produced in the hard interaction, combined with contributions from multi-parton interactions, with and without a diffractive component. The curly and straight lines are for gluons and quarks, respectively, unless indicated (W/Z). The symbol P indicates the exchange of a state with the quantum numbers of the vacuum (Pomeron).

In the latter case, the diffractive component of the multi-parton interaction does not necessarily couple to the same proton as in the hard process (not shown here) the production of jets, heavy flavors, or W/Z bosons, have been observed at the SPS, HERA, and the Tevatron [3][4][5][6][7][8]. For electron-proton hard-diffractive interactions, a factorization theorem has been proven [9], allowing the introduc-tion of diffractive parton distribution functions (dPDFs). In hadron-hadron diffractive interactions, factorization is however broken by soft multi-parton interactions [10,11], which fill the large rapidity gap and reduce the observed yields of hard-diffractive events. Such interactions are not yet simulated in the currently available Monte Carlo (MC) generators, and the reduction in the large rapidity gap harddiffraction cross section is quantified by a suppression factor, the so-called rapidity gap survival probability. At the Tevatron, the observed hard-diffractive yields relative to the corresponding inclusive processes are approximately 1%. A recent study by CDF [12] indicates that the fractions of W and Z bosons produced diffractively are (1.00 \u00b1 0.11)% and (0.88 \u00b1 0.22)%, respectively.",

According to this picture, large rapidity gap events can only arise from multiplicity fluctuations. Figure 1c shows standard W(Z) production accompanied by multi-parton interactions with a diffractive component. Hard-diffractive production ( Fig. 1d) leads to a large rapidity gap. Such contributions would result in almost unchanged central charged-particle multiplicity distributions with respect to Fig. 1b. However, a larger fraction of events with a relatively small energy deposition in the forward regions, and a smaller correlation of the energy flow in the central and forward regions, could be expected. The diffractive production mechanism with multiparton interactions is shown in Fig. 1e. In this case, large rapidity gap events only survive if the multi-parton component is small. Finally, Fig. 1f indicates a possible combination of W(Z) production mechanisms with a diffractive component in both the hard process and the multi-parton interaction.",

One is based on the matching of a reconstructed high-transversemomentum silicon tracker candidate with a track candidate found in the muon system. The second is based on a global fit to tracker and muon system hits. Muons in this analysis have to pass both selection algorithms.

Based on the pileup conditions in the 2010 data, the efficiency to detect pp pileup interactions was found to be essentially constant within \u00b125 cm along the z direction of the nominal interaction point with an average of about 72%. The inefficiency essentially depends only on the amount of soft pileup interactions (e.g., events without detectable charged particles in the central region of the detector) in the MC simulation. The reconstruction efficiency for pileup vertices was found to be essentially independent for the different luminosity periods, as long as the vertices were separated by more than 0.1 cm. The corresponding inefficiency to detect the merged pileup vertex is estimated to be 3.3%. The uncertainties from the remaining soft pileup events on the results presented below are discussed in more detail in Sect. 5.1.",

The uncertainty on the energy scale of the HF calorimeter was estimated to be about \u00b110% (for details see [27]). This uncertainty was taken into account by a \u00b110% scaling of the  Fig. 2 and all the following figures, the data points are plotted in the center of the corresponding bins, and the corresponding systematic uncertainty for the energy measurement in the HF is shown as a band. This uncertainty is much larger than the 3.5% difference between the reconstructed energy distributions in the HF+ and HF\u2212 calorimeters (cf. Table 2). The observed HF energies vary between 0 GeV (i.e., no HF tower with an energy above 4 GeV) and more than 2 TeV. Only a few events have an energy deposition above 2 TeV (about 0.05% for electrons and muons combined) and the highest energy deposition is 2.7 TeV. All events with highenergy depositions also have large tower multiplicities. The average energies observed in HF+ and HF\u2212 are measured in 11 HF rings of calorimeter towers, each covering approximately a |\u03b7| range of 0.175. The difference between the average energy deposition per ring (\u03b7 bin) in the data and the different MC tunes is consistent for all tower rings. The average energy deposited per |\u03b7| ring predicted by the D6T (Z2) tune is too large (too small), while the Pro-Q20 tune provides a very good description of the data.",

This subset of events may be enhanced by a diffractive W/Z production mechanism. Table 3 shows the observed LRG event yields and their ratio to the number of inclusive W and Z single-vertex events for the three luminosity periods. This ratio decreases by roughly a factor of 2 to 4 when going from period I to period III. The decrease can be explained by the HF energy depositions coming from soft pileup events. As discussed in Sect. 5.1 (cf. Fig. 2c), adding pileup to the Monte Carlo simulation shifts some of the LRG events to the class of low-energy depositions in the HF. The inefficiency to detect a vertex in an event with forward energy deposition depends on the instantaneous luminosity and is estimated from zero-bias events (Sect. 5.1). After correcting the observed number of LRG events in the data for pileup effects, using data, a constant fraction of LRG events, relative to the total number of W and Z events with a single primary vertex, is found for the three instantaneous luminosity periods. The corrected fraction of LRG events is given in Table 4. The uncertainties on this correction are small compared to the statistical errors and to the \u00b110% energy scale uncertainties of the HF calorimeters (for details see [27]). Indeed, this energy scale variation is the dominant systematic uncertainty for the estimated fraction of LRG events in the data, resulting in a change of about \u00b126% when varying the tower energy threshold between 3.6 and 4.4 GeV.",

The average total energy of 150 GeV with an r.m.s. of 160 GeV is about a factor of two smaller than the one observed for the inclusive HF energy distribution, and is reasonably well described by the various MC tunes. In the data, we find 2 events with no towers above the energy threshold of 4 GeV in either HF calorimeters, in agreement with the expectation from the D6T tune. This number is slightly lower, but still consistent, with the expectations from the Z2 and the PYTHIA8 2C tunes. The Pro-Q20 tune predicts 8 such events. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the signed charged lepton pseudorapidity \u03b7 in W events with a LRG signature Fig. 8 Signed lepton pseudorapidity distribution in W events with a LRG signature, with the sign defined by the pseudorapidity of the lepton relative to the gap (positive for the lepton and gap in the same hemisphere, negative otherwise). Electron and muon channels are combined. The fit result for the combination of PYTHIA6 (Pro-Q20 tune) and POMPYT predictions is shown as a dotted black line. For the other PYTHIA tunes, only the non-diffractive component is shown (electron and muon channels combined). The sign is defined to be positive when the gap and the lepton are in the same hemisphere and negative otherwise. The data show that charged leptons from W decays are found more often in the hemisphere opposite to the gap. Combining the electron and muon channels, 147 events are found with the charged lepton in the hemisphere opposite to the gap and 96 events with the lepton in the same hemisphere. Defining an asymmetry as the ratio of the difference between the numbers of LRG events in each hemisphere and the sum, the corresponding asymmetry is (\u221221.0 \u00b1 6.4)%. In the case of Z candidates (the rapidity of the Z is used) with a LRG signature, 24 (16) events are in the opposite (same) hemisphere as the gap, resulting in an asymmetry of (\u221220 \u00b1 16)%. In comparison, the various non-diffractive MC tunes predict a symmetric lepton pseudorapidity distribution in LRG events. On the other hand, events generated with the POMPYT generator, based on a diffractive production model, exhibit a strong asymmetry. This can be explained in terms of diffractive PDFs, which peak at smaller x (the parton momentum divided by the proton momentum) than the conventional proton PDFs. The produced W(Z) is thus boosted in the direction of the parton that had the larger x. This is typically the direction of the dissociated proton, i.e., opposite to the gap. The signed lepton pseudorapidity distribution in the data is fit to the predictions from the diffractive POMPYT and the non-diffractive PYTHIA event generators, with the relative fraction of the two as the free parameter. The fit results in a fraction of diffractive events in the LRG sample of (50.0 \u00b1 9.3 (stat.) \u00b1 5.2 (syst.))%, assuming the model of diffraction implemented in POMPYT and using the PYTHIA6 Pro-Q20 for the simulation of non-diffractive events. The fit results are shown in Fig. 8. The fits using the combination of POMPYT with other tunes give similar results, and only the non-diffractive contribution from the other tunes is shown in Fig. 8. The systematic uncertainty of 5.2% has been determined from the 10% HF energy scale variations and from the fits with the different tunes, using the maximal and minimal fractions obtained from the different fits.",

According to the POMPYT model of diffractive W production, such events can be interpreted as diffractive. However, while the observed fraction of such events is significantly larger than predicted with the non-diffractive PYTHIA6 D6T tune, it is smaller than expected from the PYTHIA6 Z2, Pro-Q20, and PYTHIA8 2C tunes. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn from the presence of LRG events. -The central charged-particle multiplicity in these events is somewhat larger than predicted by the various models. -The HF energy distribution opposite to the gap peaks at much smaller values than in the inclusive events, and is reasonably well described by the MC generators. -A large asymmetry is observed between the number of events with the charged lepton (from the W decay) in the opposite and with it in the same hemisphere as the pseudorapidity gap. Such an asymmetry is predicted by POMPYT, in contrast to the various non-diffractive PYTHIA MC tunes. When fitting the observed asymmetry in LRG events with an admixture of diffractive (POMPYT) and non-diffractive (PYTHIA) events, the diffractive component is determined to be (50.0 \u00b1 9.3 (stat.) \u00b1 5.2 (syst.))%, thus providing the first evidence for diffractive W production at the LHC.
