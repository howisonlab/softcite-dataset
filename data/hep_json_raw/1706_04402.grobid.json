            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is an extension of the standard model (SM) that postulates the existence of a superpartner for every SM particle with the same gauge quantum numbers but differing by one half-unit of spin. The search for a low mass top squark, the scalar partner of the top quark, is of particular interest following the discovery of a Higgs boson [9][10][11], as it would substantially contribute to the cancellation of the divergent loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass, providing a possible solution to the hierarchy problem [12][13][14]. We present results of a search for top squark pair production in the final state with a single lepton ( = e or \u00b5) with high transverse momentum (p T ), jets, and significant p T imbalance. Dedicated top squark searches have been carried out by the ATLAS [15] and CMS [16,17] collaborations based on 13 TeV proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC, with data sets corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.2 and 2.3 fb \u22121 , respectively. In this paper we report on an extension of the search of ref. [16] in the single-lepton final state that exploits the data sample collected with the CMS detector [18] in 2016, corresponding to the much larger integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . We find no evidence for an excess of events above the expected background from standard model processes, and interpret the results as limits on simplified models [19][20][21][22] of the pair production of top squarks ( t) JHEP10 2017  .

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [18].",

For signal, higher values of E miss T than for background are expected due to the presence of additional unobserved particles, the LSPs. Similarly, the M T distribution has a jacobian edge around the W boson mass for background events, whereas for signal events no such edge exists due to the presence of the LSPs. We require M T to be greater than 150 GeV. After these requirements, the largest contribution of SM background events is from processes with two lepton in the final state such as from tt (tt \u2192 2 ) where the second lepton does not pass the selection requirements for the leading lepton. Additional rejection is achieved by vetoing events containing a second lepton or isolated track passing looser identification and isolation requirements than those used for the leading lepton. We also demand that the JHEP10 (2017)019angle min \u2206\u03c6(J 1,2 , E miss T ) in the azimuthal plane between the p miss T and the direction of the closest of the two leading p T jets in the event (J 1 and J 2 ) to be greater than 0.8 radians. This requirement is motivated by the fact that background tt \u2192 2 events tend to have high-p T top quarks, and thus objects in these events tend to be collinear in the transverse plane, resulting in smaller values of min \u2206\u03c6(J 1,2 , E miss T ) than is typical for signal events.",

Further information on the experimental results to facilitate reinterpretations for beyond the SM models not considered here is given in appendix A. For a given model, limits on the production cross-section are derived as a function of the masses of the SUSY particles by combining search regions using a modified frequentist approach, employing the CL s criterion in an asymptotic formulation [44][45][46][47]. These limits are turned into exclusion regions in the m( t) \u2212 m( \u03c7 0 1 ) plane using the calculation of the -11 -JHEP10(2017)019 cross-section from reference [48] and are shown on figures 5, 6, and 7.

For model points with a small mass splitting, the ISR uncertainty described in section 3 is also significant. Since new physics signals are simulated using the CMS fast simulation program, additional uncertainties are assigned to the correction of the lepton and b tagging efficiencies, as well as to cover differences in E miss T resolution between the fast simulation and the full Geant4-based model of the CMS detector. The latter uncertainty is small in the bulk of the model space, but may reach up to 25% in scenarios with a compressed mass spectrum. Uncertainties due to the integrated luminosity, ISR modeling, E miss T resolution, and b tagging and lepton efficiencies are treated as fully correlated across search regions.

Assuming both top squarks decay to a top quark and a neutralino, we exclude at 95% CL top squark masses up to 1120 GeV for a massless neutralino and neutralino masses up to 515 GeV for a 950 GeV top squark mass.

For the mixed decay scenario, with the mass splitting between the chargino and neutralino fixed to be 5 GeV, we exclude at the 95% CL top squark masses up to 980 GeV for a massless neutralino and neutralino masses up to 400 GeV for a 825 GeV top squark mass.",

To facilitate such reinterpretations, in table 7 we provide results for a small number of inclusive aggregated signal regions.

In addition, we provide the correlation matrix for the background predictions in the full set of search regions (figures 8 and 9).
