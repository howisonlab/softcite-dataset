This paper presents measurements of two such distributions, the jet-pull angle and jet-pull magnitude, both of which are derived from the jet-pull angular moment. The measurement is performed in tt events with one leptonically decaying W boson and one hadronically decaying W boson, using 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at \u221a s = 13 TeV delivered by the Large Hadron Collider. The observables are measured for two dijet systems, corresponding to the colourconnected daughters of the W boson and the two b-jets from the top-quark decays, which are not expected to be colour connected. To allow the comparison of the measured distributions to colour model predictions, the measured distributions are unfolded to particle level, after correcting for experimental effects introduced by the detector. While good agreement can be found for some combinations of predictions and observables, none of the predictions describes the data well across all observables. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

However, due to the confining nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the direct measurement of the interactions that occur between these particles is impossible and only colour-neutral hadrons can be measured. To a good approximation, the radiation pattern in QCD can be described through a colour-connection picture, which consists of colour strings connecting quarks and gluons of one colour to quarks and gluons of the corresponding anti-colour.

The colour connections between high-energy particles affect the structure of the emitted radiation and therefore also the structure of the resulting jets. For example, soft gluon radiation is suppressed in some regions of phase space compared to others. Specifically, due to colour coherence effects, QCD predicts an increase of radiation where a colour connection is present compared to a region of phase space where no such connection exists, see Ref. [2]. Smaller effects on the event topology and measured quantities are expected from colour reconnection in the hadronisation process.",

            "text": "Providing evidence for the existence of the connections between particles -the colour flow -is important for the validation of phenomenological descriptions. Using the energyweighted distributions of particles within and between jets has been a long-standing tool for investigating colour flow, with early measurements at PETRA [3] and LEP [4,5]. Later, a precursor of the jet pull was studied using the abundant jet production at the Tevatron [6]. Recently, the colour flow was measured by ATLAS in tt events at the LHC at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV [7] using the jet-pull angle. Figure 2 illustrates the production of a tt pair and its subsequent decay into a single-lepton final state as produced at the LHC with colour connections superimposed. In the hardscatter event, four colour-charged final states can be identified: the two b-quarks produced directly by the decay of the top-quarks and the two quarks produced by the hadronically decaying W boson. As the W boson does not carry colour charge, its daughters must share a colour connection. The two b-quarks from the top-quark decays carry the colour charge of their respective top-quark parent, and are thus not expected to share a colour connection. Despite the long-standing history of measurements of the potential effects of colour connections, they remain a poorly constrained effect of QCD and require further experimental input. Furthermore, it may be possible to use the extracted colour information to distinguish between event topologies with a different colour structure. In the case of jets, such colour information would complement the kinematic properties, and might enable the identification of otherwise irreducible backgrounds, or facilitate the correct assignment of jets to a particular physical process. For example, a colourflow observable could be used to resolve the ambiguity in assigning b-jets to the Higgs boson decay in tt H (\u2192 bb) events.",

These tracking detectors, collectively called the inner detector, are immersed in a 2 T magnetic field enabling reconstruction of the track momentum. During the Long Shutdown 1, a new innermost layer of the pixel detector was inserted into the detector, the insertable B-layer (IBL) [10,11]. Two calorimeter subsystems enclose the inner detector allowing complementary calorimetric measurements of both the charged and neutral particles. Behind the calorimeters a system of muon chambers provides muon identification, triggering, and (additional) tracking. The muon system is immersed in a magnetic field provided by three toroid magnets. A more complete description of the ATLAS detector can be found elsewhere [9].",

Two alternative MC programs are used in order to estimate the impact of the choice of hard-scatter generator and hadronisation algorithm: for each of these samples one of the two components is replaced by an alternative choice. The alternative choices are Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO (MG5_aMC) [22] for the hard-scatter generator and Herwig 7 [20] for the hadronisation algorithm. Two additional simulation set-ups are used to obtain tt predictions, both of which are marked with a in Table 1: one sample uses Powheg-Box v2, with h damp set to the top-quark mass, interfaced to Pythia 6 for the hadronisation and parton shower, using the Perugia 2012 tune [26].

Matching of tracks to jets is performed using a technique called ghost association [77], in which inner-detector tracks are included in the jet clustering procedure after having scaled their fourmomenta to have infinitesimal magnitude. As a result, the tracks have no effect on the jet clustering result whilst being matched to the jet that most naturally encloses them according to the jet algorithm used. After the matching procedure, the original track four-momenta are restored. The jets used in calculating each observable are required to satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.1 so that all associated tracks are within the coverage of the inner detector.

For each measured distribution, simulated particle-level events are reweighted using a linear weight function such that the corresponding detector-level distributions are in better agreement with the data. The weights are propagated to the corresponding detector-level events and the resulting reweighted distributions are unfolded using the nominal detector-response model. Deviations of these unfolded distributions from the reweighted particle-level distributions are then assigned as the non-closure uncertainty. A summary of the uncertainties affecting \u03b8 P j W 1 , j W 2 is shown in Table 4. The total uncertainty is dominated by systematic uncertainties, with those accounting for tt modelling being dominant in most bins. Uncertainties that directly affect the inputs to the pull-vector calculation, such as the JES, JER and track uncertainties are generally sub-dominant.",

This is because Table 4 gives the uncertainties appropriate for a comparison between normalised distributions in which overall scale uncertainties play no role. As a result, many of the experimental uncertainties, which have little to no impact on the shape of the measured distributions, also have a reduced effect on the measurement. For example, the uncertainties due to b-tagging reduce from around 7.5% to less than 0.5%. Figure 5 compares the normalised unfolded data to several Standard Model (SM) predictions, summarised in Table 1, for all four observables. Three SM predictions use Powheg to generate the hard-scatter events and then differ for the subsequent hadronisation, namely Pythia 6, Pythia 8, and Herwig 7. A main difference between these predictions is that the Pythia family uses the colour string model [96] while Herwig uses the cluster model [20] for hadronisation. One SM prediction uses MG5_aMC to produce the hard-scatter event, the hadronisation is then performed using Pythia 8. Finally, one SM prediction is obtained from events generated with Sherpa. Figure 6 compares the normalised unfolded data to the SM prediction as well as a prediction obtained from the exotic model with flipped colour flow described in Sect. 3. Both predictions are obtained from MC samples generated with Powheg + Pythia 8. The data agree better with the SM prediction than the colour-flipped sample.",

The calibrated four-momentum is required to satisfy p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.
