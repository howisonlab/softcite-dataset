A mass of 994 g p-type point-contact high purity germanium detector has been installed to search the neutrinoless double beta decay events, as well as to directly detect dark matter particles. An exposure of 304 kg\u2022day has been analyzed. The wideband spectrum from 500 keV to 3 MeV was obtained and the average event rate at the 2.039 MeV energy range is about 0.012 count per keV per kg per day. The half-life of 76 Ge neutrinoless double beta decay has been derived based on this result as: T 0\uf06e 1/2 > 6.4\u00d710 22 yr (90% C.L.). An upper limit on the effective Majorana-neutrino mass of 5.0 eV has been achieved. The possible methods to further decrease the background level have been discussed and will be pursued in the next stage of CDEX experiment.",

The differences of the squared mass eigenstates of three neutrinos has been measured though the absolute mass scale is unknown until now. So the neutrino mass hierarchy problem has been a hot topic in the neutrino domain, together with other important problems [4,5,6]. Neutrinoless double beta decay (0\uf06e\uf062\uf062) experiment has been one of the important experiments due to its strong relation with several important topics including the confirmation of the Dirac or Majorana character of neutrino, the lepton number conservation problem, and so on [7].",

The CDEX-1 experiment, the first stage of CDEX collaboration in order to study the performances of the CDEX prototype detectors, has developed a 1kg-scale p-type point-contact germanium detector with several output channels to cover both low energy region (down to 500 eV) for dark matter detection and high energy region (up to 3 MeV) for double beta decay experiment [20].

The most stringent sensitivity for WIMP-nucleus spin-independent interaction based on a point-contact germanium detector has been achieved by CDEX-1 experiment and the favored region by CoGeNT experiment has been excluded with an identical detector technique [23]. The measured cross sections of spin-dependent \uf063-neutron were also published and it is the best sensitivities below 6 GeV/c 2 [24].

The CDEX-1 HPGe detector worked at +3500 V provided by a high voltage module (CANBERRA 3106D). One output from the tiny P+ electrode was fed into a Canberra 2111 fast amplifier in order to cover a wide dynamic energy range of up to 3 MeV for 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay experiment, together with several outputs to be specially tuned to favor the low energy region below 1 keV for dark matter detection. The output from NaI(Tl) anti-Compton detector, and the inhibit signal from the CDEX-1 pointcontact HPGe detector were recorded at the same time for offline data analysis. These outputs were digitized and recorded by a flash analog-to-digital convertor (FADC, CAEN V1724) at a 100 MHz sampling rate with a resolution of 14 bits. The data acquisition software is based on the LabVIEW program. Random trigger signals (RT) at 0.05 Hz generated by a precision pulser were injected into the system, in order to monitor the noise level and dead time of the data acquisition system and provide the system trigger. The total DAQ trigger rate is about 3~5 Hz in order to decrease the penalty of dead time.

Figure 1 shows the calibration curve of one dataset. Five gamma peaks from 214 Bi (609.3 keV, 1.764 MeV), 228 Ac (911.2 keV), 40 K (1.461 MeV) and 208 Tl (2.615 MeV) has been used, and the calibration curve was obtained by fitting these points with a second-order polynomial. The calibration results show that the deviation of reconstructed peak positions of the gamma lines was smaller than 0.3 keV to their nominal values. A typical pulse from the P+ electrode channel of the CDEX-1 PCGe detector was parameterized with several numbers to describe its characteristics as displayed in Figure   4 of reference [24]. Two energy-related parameters are defined: (i) the maximal amplitude of one pulse (Amax) and (ii) the integration of one pulse which was chosen to define as energy (E) for its excellent energy resolution and linearity at the high-energy range. The germanium detector has ability 000000-3 of single-site event (SSE) and multi-site event (MSE) discrimination, based on the pulse shapes of the charge signals. A parameter of Amax/E was used to discriminate the events of SSE and MSE as shown in Figure 2, SSE has a relatively large pulse height than MSE in the case of same energy events. 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay event is mainly SSE in bulk volume of the crystal, resulting in a nearly Gaussian distribution of Amax/E. The energy resolution of the detector for SSEs can be extracted from SSE cut. The cut lines are determined by fitting the Amax/E distribution boundaries of SSE of the Compton continuum parts in the energy region of larger than 1MeV in Figure 2. The whole datasets have been divided into 4 groups in chronological order and an independent analysis has been performed for each group. \uf03d \uf02b \uf0d7 and the average extrapolated FWHM at Q\u03b2\u03b2 is 4.3\u00b10.2 keV. In fact we just use the SSE cut to calculate the energy resolution for SSE events at Q\u03b2\u03b2 in this paper and do not apply this SSE cut to further decrease the background level of the spectrum due to the quite complicated efficiency correction. This will be tried in the next stage of CDEX double beta decay experiment.  The preamplifier used in CDEX-1 is a pulsed reset preamplifier which works in a pulsed mode and it was reset to its initial condition by discharging the FET quickly marked by one Reset Inhibit Signal [24]. As shown in Figure 4(a), the charge of one event which has a high energy and locates close to the end of the reset period may not be completely collected. This kind of events can be excluded by the reset inhibit signal, however, it will induce an energy dependent efficiency. If there is only one physical event in a reset period, the efficiency can be calculated as:",

            "text": "In order to understand the background contribution in Q\u03b2\u03b2 energy range of the CDEX-1 detector, simulations of different radioactive impurities in the different locations of the detector setup were performed based on Geant 4.10.2. A dead layer of 1.02\uf0b10.14 mm in the top and lateral side of the germanium crystal of the CDEX-1 detector is set in the simulation. Table 1 lists all the simulated background components and their locations. In the simulation, 238 U decay chain and 232 Th decay chain were treated as secular equilibrium and uniformly distribution. However, considering the radon gas contamination from outside space though pure nitrogen gas are flushing during the data taking, the 238 U chain in copper shield is treated as two parts, one is the isotopes before 222 Rn, and the other is the isotopes which begin from 222 Rn in the decay chain. The simulated locations of the radioactive impurities are mainly in five parts of the experiment setup: the copper shield, NaI(Tl) crystal, the copper shell of the germanium detector, the electronics of the germanium detector and the germanium crystal itself. The simulated radioactive impurities include natural decay chains of 238 U and 232 Th, 40 K, and these cosmogenic isotopes in germanium crystal and the detector copper shell. In addition, 40 K decays in the PMT window of the NaI(Tl) Anti-Compton detector were considered in the simulation. Due to the extremely low muon flux in CJPL [26], muons and their secondary particles have not be considered. Neutrons are also negligible due to their quite low flux in the 1m-depth polyethylene room in CJPL main hall. Simulation shows that gamma induced energy spectra from sources in the electronics and the detector copper shell have similar shapes in high energy range. Their contributions can be represented by one of them in this analysis. And the background contribution of NaI(Tl) crystal is negligible because the vast majority events from it are excluded by the AC cut.  Figure 6 shows the background model and its decomposition. The background model was obtained by fitting the experimental spectrum with the simulated spectra of all the components in the energy range of 500-3000 keV, using a least-squares method. The contribution of 2\uf06e\uf062\uf062 was calculated on the basis of the half-life measured in reference [31]. Contributions of the cosmogenic isotopes (except 60 Co) in the germanium crystal were determined by the corresponding Kx characteristic peaks in the low energy range of its experimental spectrum (0-12keV) [24]. Contributions of other radioactive impurities were determined by the best fit of the background model. The background model shows that the main background contributions are from 232 Th and 238 U decay chain in the copper shield and the preamplifier electronics of the germanium detector. 68 Ga and 60 Co in the germanium crystal and 60 Co in the copper shell also have a relatively high background contributions in the Q\u03b2\u03b2 energy range. The background model predicts a flat background in the Q\u03b2\u03b2 energy range which is used as a background model for the 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 event number estimation in the interested energy region.",

N 0v is the observed events of 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay. \u03b51 is the detection efficiency for 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 events due to the reset period of the preamplifier. \u03b52 is the efficiency due to the artificial dead time. The factor \u03b53 represents the probability that the two electrons from one 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay event deposit all their energy in the active volume of the germanium detector, resulting in a full energy peak at 2039 keV, and its value is obtained by simulation. In the simulation, the energies of the two electron and the angle between their emitted directions are sampled on the basis of the distribution described by the theoretical formulas in reference [32]. The dead layer in the top and lateral side of the detector has also been considered in the simulation. The simulation result gives that the efficiency of the full energy deposit is (88.6\u00b10.6) %. A profile likelihood method has been used to evaluate the signal strength of 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay in the energy range 2020 keV -2060 keV [33]. The fitted function consists of two parts: a constant term for background and a gauss function for 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay signals. The mean and the standard deviation of the gauss function is fixed according to the Q value of the 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay and the expected SSE energy resolution. The systematic uncertainties on the peak position (\u00b10.3keV), the resolution and efficiencies have been considered by a Monte Carlo method. Figure 7 shows the energy spectrum without efficiency correction in this energy range. According to the fitting result, no peak was found at Q\u03b2\u03b2 energy. The 90% C.L. limit of the half-life of 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay is  The measured 0\uf06e\uf062\uf062 decay half-life limit of 76 Ge gives an upper limit on the effective Majorana-neutrino mass of 5.0 eV. This result is obtained by using the nuclear matrix element (NME) from [34]. Figure 8 shows the comparison of this result with the limits from Gerda Collaboration phase I using the same NME [8]. The green and magenta areas in Figure 8 are the allowed values for the effective Majorana mass as a function of the smallest neutrino mass for both the inverted and normal mass hierarchies, according to the 1\u03c3 range values of neutrino oscillation parameters mentioned in reference [35].
