The value of a 0 and a 2 can be rigorously calculated in Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) [4,5], predicting a 0 \u2212 a 2 = (0.265 \u00b1 0.004)M \u22121 \u03c0 + and the A 2\u03c0 lifetime \u03c4 = (2.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u2022 10 \u221215 s [6]. The measurement of \u0393 2\u03c0 0 provides an important test of the theory since a 0 \u2212 a 2 is sensitive to the quark condensate defining the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD [7]. The method reported in this article implies observation of the pionium state through its ionization into two pions. Given its large Bohr radius, this is directly sensitive to \u03c0\u03c0 scattering at threshold, M \u03c0\u03c0 \u223c 2M \u03c0 + , and thus delivers a precision test of the theory without requiring threshold extrapolation, as for semileptonic Ke4 decays [8], or substantial theoretical input as for K \u2192 3\u03c0 decays [9].",

Final-state Coulomb interaction leads to an enhancement of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs at low relative c.m. momentum (Q) and to the formation of A 2\u03c0 bound states or pionium. These atoms may either directly decay, or evolve by excitation (de-excitation) to different quantum states. They would finally decay or be broken up (be ionized) by the electric field of the target atoms. In the case of decay, the most probable channel is \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and the next channel is \u03b3\u03b3 with a small branching ratio of 0.36%. In the case of breakup, characteristic atomic pion pairs emerge [10]. These have a very low Q (< 3 MeV/c) and very small opening angle in the laboratory frame (< 3 mrad). A high-resolution magnetic spectrometer (\u2206p/p \u223c 3 \u2022 10 \u22123 ) is used [11] to split the pairs and measure their relative momentum with sufficient precision to detect the pionium signal. This signal lays above a continuum background from free (unbound) Coulomb pairs produced in semi-inclusive proton-nucleus interactions. Other background sources are non-Coulomb pairs where one or both pions originate from a long-lived source (\u03b7, \u03b7 , \u039b, . . .) and accidental coincidences from different protonnucleus interactions.",

We now present final results from the analysis of \u223c 1.5 \u2022 10 9 events recorded from 2001 to 2003. Compared to the results in [13], this analysis has reduced systematic errors and improved track reconstruction, mostly due to the use of the GEM-MSGC detector [11] information, which leads to a larger signal yield. The present data come from collisions of 20 and 24 GeV/c protons, delivered by the CERN PS, impinging on a thin Ni target foil of 94 or 98 \u00b5m thickness for different run periods.",

A suitable choice of the target material and thickness provides the appropriate balance between the A 2\u03c0 breakup and annihilation yields, with reduced multiplescattering [14,15]. For a thin Ni target, of order \u223c 10 \u22123 X 0 , the relative c.m. momentum Q of the atomic pairs is less than \u223c 3 MeV/c and their number is \u223c 10% of the total number of free pairs in the same Q region [16]. The experiment is thus designed for maximal signal sensitivity in a very reduced region of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 phase space. This is done by selective triggering and by exploiting the high resolution of the spectrometer and background rejection capabilities. The longitudinal (Q L ) and transverse (Q T ) components of Q, defined with respect to the direction of the total laboratory momentum of the pair, are measured with precisions 0.55 MeV/c and 0.10 MeV/c, respectively.",

Small admixtures of misidentified pp and residual contamination from e + e \u2212 pairs have been measured and produce no effect on the final result. The fraction of accidental pairs in F B was measured by time-of-flight to be \u03c9 acc 12.5%, averaged over the pair momentum and the different data sets. The experimental resolutions on the momentum and opening angle must be accurately simulated in order to extract the narrow pionium signal. Multiple-scattering in the target and the spectrometer is the primary source of uncertainty on the Q T measurement. In order to achieve the desired Q T resolution, the scattering angle must be known with \u223c 1% precision, which is beyond the currently available GEANT description [25]. An improved multiple-scattering description was implemented based on dedicated measurements of the average scattering angle off material samples [26]. A cross-check with the standard GEANT description was made by comparing the momentum evolution of the measured distance between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 at the target [27].",

The largest systematic error comes from a \u223c 1% uncertainty in the multiple-scattering angle inside the Ni target foil which induces a \u00b10.0077 error on P br . The momentum smearing correction can increase P br by \u223c 2% and thus produce a \u00b10.0026 systematic error. The double-track resolution at small angles can change P br by 1.1% and generate a systematic error of \u00b10.0014. The admixture of K + K \u2212 changes P br by \u223c 1%. The uncertainty on such contamination is 15% and produces a systematic error of \u00b10.0011 on P br . The finite-size correction to the point-like approximation creates a maximum 0.8% variation of the simulated yield of Coulomb pairs and a systematic error of \u00b10.0011 on P br . The influence of the finalstate strong interaction on the \u03c4 dependence of P br is negligible [18,22]. The trigger response efficiency was measured using minimum-bias events and accidental pairs from calibration runs. The efficiency is high and quite uniform in the selected Q T , Q L domain and it drops by \u223c 2% per MeV/c at |Q L | > 15 MeV/c. The simulated and experimental trigger efficiencies agree to better than 0.5%, in the same |Q L | range. This maximum deviation increases the breakup probability by \u223c 3% and thus produces a systematic error of \u00b10.0004. Background hits in the upstream spectrometer region, generated by beam and secondary interactions in the target region, are the source of a \u00b10.0001 systematic error on P br . The effect of the lower purity of the 94 \u00b5m Ni target foil compared to the 98 \u00b5m is an underestimation of P br by \u223c 1.1%.
