            "text": "The Sivers function describes the correlation between the transverse spin of a nucleon and the transverse motion of its partons. For quarks, it was studied in previous measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry of hadrons produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons off transversely polarised nucleon targets, and it was found to be non-zero. In this letter the evaluation of the Sivers asymmetry for gluons is presented. The contribution of the photon-gluon fusion subprocess is enhanced by requiring two high transverse-momentum hadrons. The analysis method is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that includes three hard processes: photon-gluon fusion, QCD Compton scattering and the leading-order virtual-photon absorption process. The Sivers asymmetries of the three processes are simultaneously extracted using the LEPTO event generator and a neural network approach. The method is applied to samples of events containing at least two hadrons with large transverse momentum from the COMPASS data taken with a 160 GeV/c muon beam scattered off transversely polarised deuterons and protons. With a significance of about two standard deviations, a negative value is obtained for the gluon Sivers asymmetry. The result of a similar analysis for a Collins-like asymmetry for gluons is consistent with zero.",

            "text": "An interesting and recently examined property of the quark distribution in a nucleon that is polarised transversely to its momentum is not left-right symmetric with respect to the plane defined by the directions of nucleon spin and momentum. This asymmetry of the distribution function is called the Sivers effect. It was first suggested [1] as an explanation of the large left-right single transverse spin asymmetries observed for pions produced in the reaction p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0 X [2][3][4]. Soon after, the existence of such an asymmetric distribution, known as Sivers distribution function, was excluded on the basis of T-invariance arguments [5]. Only ten years later it was recognised that such a function may indeed exist [6]. At that time it was also predicted that the Sivers function in semi-inclusive measurements of hadron production in DIS (SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process should have opposite sign [7], a property referred to as \"restricted universality\". A few years later, the Sivers effect for quarks was observed in SIDIS experiments using transversely polarised proton targets, first by the HERMES Collaboration [8] and then by the COMPASS Collaboration [9]. From combined analyses of the first HERMES data and the early COMPASS data taken with a transversely polarised deuteron target [10], first extractions of the Sivers functions for u and dquarks emerged [11][12][13]. Since then, more precise measurements of the Sivers effect were performed by the HERMES [14] and COM-PASS [15][16][17] Collaborations, and new measurements with a transversely polarised 3 He target were also carried out at JLab [18,19]. More information can be found in recent reviews [20][21][22].",

Recently, the issue has been discussed repeatedly in the literature and the properties of the gluon Sivers distributions have been studied in great detail [23,24]. While it was found that a non-zero Sivers function implies transverse motion of partons in the nucleon, presently the connection between the Sivers function and the parton orbital angular momentum in the nucleon can only be described in a model-dependent way [25]. Originally, the correspondence between the left-right asymmetry now known as Sivers effect and parton orbital angular momentum was proposed by Sivers himself [1,26], and then it was further elaborated by several authors [27][28][29].",

From the null result of the COM-PASS experiment for the Sivers asymmetry of positive and negative hadrons produced on a transversely polarised deuteron target [10], together with additional theoretical considerations, it was stated [32] that the gluon contribution to parton orbital angular momentum should be negligible, and consequently that the gluon Sivers effect should be small. Also, using the so-called transverse momentum dependent (TMD) generalised parton model and the most recent phenomenological information on the quark Sivers distributions coming from SIDIS data, constraints on the gluon Sivers function were derived [33] from the recent precise data on the transverse single spin asymmetry A N (p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 X) that was measured at central rapidity by the PHENIX Collaboration at RHIC [34]. Altogether, it is of great interest to know whether there exists a Sivers effect for gluons or not.",

Tagging the charm quark by identifying D-mesons in the final state has the advantage that in lowest order of the strong coupling constant there are no other contributions to the cross section, so that one becomes essentially sensitive to the gluon distribution function. An alternative method to tag the gluon in DIS, which was also developed and used by COM-PASS is the production of high-p T hadrons [36,37] that has the advantage of higher statistics. In the leading process, the hadron transverse momentum p T with respect to the virtual photon direction (in the frame where the nucleon momentum is parallel to this direction) originates from the intrinsic transverse momentum k T of the struck quark in the nucleon and its fragmentation, which both lead to a small transverse component. On the contrary, both the QCDC and PGF hard subprocesses can provide hadrons with high transverse momentum. Therefore, tagging events with hadrons of high transverse momentum p T enhances the contribution of higher-order subprocesses. Nevertheless, although in such a high-p T sample the PGF fraction is enriched, the contributions from LP and QCDC have to be subtracted in order to single out the contribution of the PGF subprocess to the measured asymmetry [38].",

The transversely polarised deuteron target used in the years 2003 and 2004 was consisting of two oppositely polarised cylindrical cells situated along the beam, each 60 cm long with a 10 cm gap in between. In 2010, the transversely polarised proton target consisted of three cells, 30 cm, 60 cm and 30 cm long with 5 cm gaps between them. The polarisation direction in the central cell was opposite to that in the downstream and upstream cells. During all data taking periods, the polarisation direction was reversed once per week in order to minimise systematic effects due to acceptance. For the measurements using a deuteron target the cells were filled with 6 LiD. The 6 Li nucleus can be regarded to be composed of a quasi-free deuteron and a 4 He core. The average dilution factor f d , which is defined as ratio of the DIS cross section for only the polarisable nucleons in the target over the DIS cross section for all target nucleons, amounts to 0.36 including also electromagnetic radiative corrections. The average deuteron polarisation was 0.50. For the measurements using a proton target, the cells were filled with NH 3 . The average dilution factor f p amounts to 0.15 and the average proton polarisation was 0.80. A muon beam energy of 160 GeV/c was chosen for all measurements. The basic features of the COMPASS spectrometer, as described in Ref. [40], are the same for 2003-2004 and 2010 data taking. Several upgrades were performed in 2005, where the main one was the installation of a new target magnet that allowed us to increase the polar angle acceptance from 70 mrad to 180 mrad.",

As a result of MC studies, the best correlation is found between \u03c6 g and \u03c6 P , where the latter denotes the azimuthal angle of the vector sum P of the two hadron momenta. For the present analysis, two charged hadrons are selected in each event. If more than two charged hadrons are reconstructed in an event, only the hadron with the largest transverse momentum, p T 1 , and the one with the second-largest transverse momentum, p T 2 , are taken into account. In order to enhance the PGF fraction in the sample and at the same time the correlation between \u03c6 g and \u03c6 P , further requirements are applied to the transverse momenta of the two hadrons, i.e. p T 1 > 0.7 GeV/c and p T 2 > 0.4 GeV/c.

It contains eight azimuthal modulations, which are functions of the single-hadron azimuthal angle and \u03c6 S . In the absence of correlations possibly introduced by experimental effects, all eight are orthogonal. The Sivers asymmetry can either be extracted by fitting only the amplitude of the sin \u03c6 Siv modulation or one can perform a simultaneous fit of all eight amplitudes. In the case of heavyquark pair and dijet production in lepton-nucleon collisions, all azimuthal asymmetries associated to the gluon distribution function have been recently worked out in Ref. [44]. There, the Sivers asymmetry is defined as the amplitude of the sin (\u03c6 T \u2212 \u03c6 S ) modulation, where \u03c6 T is the azimuthal angle of the transverse-momentum vector of the quark-antiquark pair, q T . In our analysis, \u03c6 T is replaced by \u03c6 P exploiting its correlation with the gluon azimuthal angle \u03c6 g , and the Sivers asymmetry is extracted taking into account only the sin (\u03c6 P \u2212 \u03c6 S ) modulation in the cross section. It was verified that including in the cross section the same eight transverse-spin modulations as in SIDIS single-hadron production [43] and fitting all eight amplitudes simultaneously leads to the same result on the gluon Sivers asymmetry.",

At COMPASS kinematics, the leading process appears at zero-order QCD in the total DIS cross section and it is the dominant subprocess, while the other two subprocesses, photon-gluon fusion and QCD Compton, are first-order QCD processes and hence suppressed.

The event generation was done with and without 'Parton Shower' [51]. Two PDF sets were used (MSTW08 or CTEQ5L [52]). Two different parametrisations of the longitudinal structure function F L are used, either the one from LEPTO or the one used for the R = \u03c3 L /\u03c3 T parametrisation of Ref. [53]. For secondary interactions, either the FLUKA or the GHEISHA [54] package were used. Fig. 6 shows the resulting gluon Sivers asymmetries, as obtained when using eight different MC productions for deuteron and proton data. The results shown in the top row are chosen to be the final ones, as they yield the best comparison between experimental and MC data, which is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The settings used here are FLUKA and Parton Shower, F L from LEPTO The systematic uncertainty due to false asymmetries was studied by extracting asymmetries between two parts of the same target cell. The results are found to be compatible with zero. Furthermore, it was checked how a small artificial false amplitude of the sin \u03c6 g \u2212 \u03c6 S modulation in the MC production influences the final result.

The two results are expected to be consistent, as presumably the transverse motion of gluons is the same in neutron and proton. Combining the proton and deuteron results, the measured effect is negative, A Siv P G F = \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.08(stat) \u00b1 0.05(syst), which is away from zero by more than two standard deviations of the quadratically combined uncertainty. This result appears particularly interesting in view of the gluon contribution to the proton spin, as a non-zero gluon Sivers effect is a signature of gluon orbital angular momentum in the proton [25]. While the recent analysis of the PHENIX data [33] yields a gluon Sivers effect for the proton that is compatible with zero, the COMPASS result for the proton is negative and more than two standard deviations below zero. The two results may not be directly comparable, as they are obtained at different values of centre of mass energy and x g . It may also be important to recall that the existence of colour gauge links complicates the picture, as they lead to two different universal gluon Sivers functions, which combine with process-dependent calculable factors in the two processes [56]. As a result, the gluon Sivers  function that appears in one process may be different from the one appearing in a different process, so that and assessment of compatibility may require a deeper theoretical analysis. For the asymmetry of the leading process, the high-p T sample of the COMPASS proton data has provided a positive value (see Fig. 7 right-bottom panel). It can be compared with the COMPASS results on the Sivers asymmetry for charged hadrons produced in SIDIS p \u2192 h \u00b1 X single-hadron production [17], which for negative hadrons was found to be about zero and for positive hadrons different from zero and positive, so that for the two-hadron final state a positive value may indeed be expected.",

The amplitude of the Collins modulation for gluons is found to be consistent with zero, in agreement with the naive expectation that is based on the fact that there is no gluon transversity distribution [57]. Recently it was suggested that a transversity-like TMD gluon distribution h g 1 could generate a sin (\u03c6 S + \u03c6 T ) modulation in leptoproduction of two jets or heavy quarks [44]. In this case the results shown in Fig. 8 provide a bound on the size of h g 1 . The results given in this letter can also be interpreted such that no false Collins-like asymmetry is introduced by the rather complex analysis method used, so that the non-zero result obtained for the gluon Sivers asymmetry is supported. In addition it is noted that the Collins-like asymmetry of the leading process for the proton is found to be consistent with zero for high-p T hadron pairs, in qualitative agreement with the measurement of the Collins asymmetry in single-hadron SIDIS measurement [58], where opposite values of about equal size were observed for positive and negative hadrons.",

The analysis is very similar to the one already used by the COMPASS collaboration to measure g/g, the gluon polarisation in a longitudinally polarised nucleon. The large kinematic acceptance of the COMPASS apparatus and the high energy of the muon beam make the sample containing two high-p T hadrons sufficiently large for the present analysis, which is limited to a small part of the accessible phase space. The criteria applied to select hadron pairs allow us to enhance the contribution of the photon-gluon fusion subprocess with respect to the leadingorder virtual-photon absorption subprocess. The Sivers asymmetry is obtained as the amplitude of the sine modulation in the Sivers angle, \u03c6 Siv = \u03c6 P \u2212 \u03c6 S .",

Still, it is necessary to subtract the contributions of the other two subprocesses, LP and QCDC. In this analysis, the fractions of the three subprocesses are determined using MC algorithms, and the three corresponding asymmetries are extracted from the data using a NN technique. Since the results derived from a NN approach strongly depend on the Monte Carlo sample on which the network was trained, the analysis requires a precise MC description of the data. Hence much effort was devoted to obtain a good description of the experimental data by MC simulations. In particular, the analysis was repeated using eight different MC simulations and the (small) differences in the resulting Sivers asymmetries are included in the systematic uncertainties.",
