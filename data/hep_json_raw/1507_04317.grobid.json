Measurements lasting for 14 annual cycles with an increasing exposure which cumulatively is equivalent to 1.33 ton \u00d7 year confirm the annual modulation effect at a confidence level of 9.3\u03c3 [36]. No systematic effect or side reaction which could mimic the exploited signature, i.e. which would be able to account for the whole modulation amplitude and simultaneously satisfy all of the many peculiarities of the signature, has been found by the collaboration itself, neither it was suggested by anyone else over more than a decade.",

Such a dark sector may consist of elementary leptons (analogues of our electron) and baryons (similar to our proton or neutron) composed of shadow quarks which are confined by strong gauge interactions like in our QCD. These two types of particles can be combined in atoms by electromagnetic forces mediated by dark photons. The stability of the dark proton is guaranteed by the conservation law of the related baryon number, as the stability of our proton is related to the conservation of the ordinary baryon number. On the other hand, the cosmological abundance of DM in the Universe can be induced by the violation of such baryon number in the early Universe which could produce dark baryon asymmetry by mechanisms similar to those considered for the primordial baryogenesis in the observable sector. In this respect, such type of DM is also known as asymmetric dark matter.",

Thus, all ordinary particles described by the Standard Model SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), the electron e, proton p, neutron n, photon \u03b3 , neutrinos \u03bd etc., should have massdegenerate invisible twins: e , p , n , \u03b3 , \u03bd etc. which are sterile to our strong, weak and and electromagnetic interac-tions but have instead their own gauge interactions, described by the mirror copy of the Standard Model SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) with exactly the same quantum numbers and coupling constants. In this case, the microphysics of the mirror matter should be exactly the same as that of ordinary matter, at all levels from particle to atomic physics.",

However, as it was shown in [50], all problems can be avoided assuming that after inflation the two sectors were heated to different temperatures, and the temperature of the mirror sector T remained less than the ordinary one T over all stages of the cosmological evolution. The BBN limits are satisfied if T < T /2 or so, while for T < T /4 mirror matter can represent the entire fraction of DM since in this case early decoupling of the mirror photons renders mirror baryons practically indistinguishable from the canonic cold dark matter (CDM) in observational tests related to the large scale structure formation and CMB anisotropies [50][51][52]. Interestingly, the condition T < T can also lead to mirror baryon asymmetry bigger than the ordinary one, and B 5 B can be naturally obtained in certain co-baryogenesis scenarios [53][54][55][56]. Therefore, the mirror matter can be a viable candidate for DM, despite its collisional and dissipative nature, and the present situation in fundamental physics and cosmology gives new perspectives for testing this intriguing hypothesis with a rich predictive power (for reviews, see e.g. [56][57][58]).",

            "text": "More in general, the mirror DM can also be presented in the form known as asymmetric mirror matter, which assumes that mirror parity is spontaneously broken and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale v in the mirror sector is much larger than that in our Standard Model, v = 174 GeV [59][60][61][62]. In this case, the mirror world becomes a heavier and deformed copy of our world, with mirror particle masses scaled in different ways with respect to the masses of the ordinary particles. Taking the mirror weak scale e.g. of the order of 10 TeV, the mirror electron would become two orders of magnitude heavier than our electron while the mirror nucleons p and n only about 5 times heavier than the ordinary nucleons. Then dark matter would exist in the form of mirror hydrogen composed of mirror proton and electron, with mass of about 5 GeV which is a rather interesting mass range for dark matter particles [63,64]. In the context of baryo-cogenesis mechanisms [53][54][55][56], B 5 B can be simply related to the mass ratio 5 between mirror and ordinary baryons [56,63,64] (see also Ref. [65]). Owing to the large mass of mirror electron, mirror atoms should be more compact and tightly bound with respect to ordinary atoms. Asymmetric mirror model can be considered as a natural benchmark for more generic types of atomic dark matter with ad hoc chosen parameters.",

This mixing mediates the mirror atom scattering off the ordinary target nuclei in the NaI(Tl) detectors at DAMA/LIBRA setup with the Rutherford-like cross sections. The compactness of mirror atoms is important here. On the one hand, if these atoms are sufficiently fuzzy, the electromagnetic scattering between ordinary and mirror nuclei will not be suppressed by the mirror atom form-factor. On the other hand, they should be rather compact to render self-interaction of the mirror matter weak enough -otherwise the structure of galactic halo would be strongly affected. Moreover, if the scattering cross-section between mirror atoms is such that \u03c3/M \u223c 10 \u221224 \u2212 10 \u221223 cm 2 /GeV, where M is the dark atom mass, some characteristic problems for canonic CDM models as the cusp problem or overly large number of small halos within the local group can be avoided [67,68].",

However, one can consider another possibility when mirror parity is spontaneously broken at the level of electroweak interactions so that the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of mirror Higgs H = v is much larger than that of the ordinary Higgs H = v \u2248 174 GeV [59][60][61]. 2 Such a concept of asymmetric mirror matter introduces a new parameter, the ratio \u03b6 = v /v between the VEVs, while the gauge and Yukawa constants in two sectors essentially remain identical.

The SUSY DM in the form of neutralinos can be destabilized by introducing a tiny violation of R-parity, or perhaps not so tiny but in specific forms which would not affect the matter stability itself, as e.g. in Refs. [69,70]. 2 Mechanisms of discrete symmetry breaking between ordinary and mirror sectors were discussed e.g. in Refs. [60,61]. Seemingly, there emerges a hierarchy problem between the two VEVs v and v, which however can be turned into positive aspect ameliorating the hierarchy problem for the ordinary Higgs, in the context of supersymmetric little Higgs or twin Higgs models [58,71,72]. In these models the Higgs in ordinary sector emerges as a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the breaking of the accidental global SU (4) symmetry between two Higgs systems, and thus the mass and VEV of ordinary Higgs H can be smaller, within two orders of magnitude or so, than the VEV of the mirror Higgs H , v \u223c10 TeV.",

Namely, the masses of shadow quarks and charged leptons are induced by the Yukawa couplings with the Higgs H , and so they scale roughly by a factor \u03b6 with respect of the masses of their ordinary twins (e.g. m e,u,d \u03b6 m e,u,d for the electron, up-quark and down-quark, if one neglects the renormalization group running factors for quarks from the scale H down to H ), the mirror neutrino masses which emerge from the dimension-5 operators 1 M l l H H quadratic in Higgs field, scale by a factor \u03b6 2 with respect to ordinary neutrino masses generated by similar operators 1 M ll H H . In addition, the 'Fermi' constant of mirror weak interactions becomes smaller by a factor \u03b6 2 , with respect to our Fermi constant G F , while the infrared scale of mirror QCD changes roughly as \u223c \u03b6 0.28 with respect to our QCD scale due to the threshold effects of heavier mirror quarks. If \u03b6 \u2264 10 2 , for the masses of light mirror quarks u and d we have m u,d < , and so for the mass of mirror pions we get roughly m \u03c0 /m \u03c0 \u223c \u03b6 0.6 . Hence, taking e.g. \u03b6 = 100, shadow electrons become two orders of magnitude heavier than our electron, shadow neutrinos 10 4 times heavier than our neutrinos, but shadow proton and neutron only about 5 times heavier than ordinary nucleons, e.g. m p \u03b6 0.28 m p + \u03b6(2m u + m d ), due to larger QCD scale and larger masses of light mirror quarks. Hence, mirror nucleon masses become about 5 GeV which is an interesting mass range for dark matter particles. In addition, due to the large mass gap between the masses of mirror neutron and proton, m n \u2212 m p m e , the neutron becomes unstable even if it is bounded in nuclei, and hence the only stable atom in such shadow sector can be the mirror hydrogen composed of mirror proton and electron [59][60][61]. Needless to say, that mirror hydrogen can be presented in molecular form, while some its fraction can exist in ionized state: if dark electron and proton are sufficiently heavy, the matter may remain essentially ionized owing to very small recombination cross section.",

This leptogenesis mechanism predicts n B = n B and so for B / B 5 we need m N /m N 5, which singles out the mass of dark atom of about 5 GeV. (Somewhat different leptogenesis mechanism also based on the assumption m N > m N was suggested in Ref. [65].) This would occur when \u03b6 \u223c 100 in which case the mirror electron mass is m e \u223c 50 MeV [56,58,63,64]. Let us remark, however, that in the picture of asymmetric mirror world the mirror (sterile) neutrinos could also be a natural candidate of dark matter, namely warm dark matter. In fact, assuming a minimal mass normal hierarchy for ordinary neutrino masses, one can approximate to current cosmological data with a single mass eigenstate with mass m \u03bd = 0.06 eV. We have then \u03bd h 2 \u2248 m \u03bd /93 eV \u2248 6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , well below the cosmological limits on the neutrino masses. Since the mirror neutrino masses scale roughly as m \u03bd a = \u03b6 2 m \u03bd a , a = 1, 2, 3, then for \u03b6 \u223c 10 2 or more we would have 3 , where x \u03bd = T \u03bd /T \u03bd is the temperature ratio between the mirror and ordinary neutrinos in the early Universe (which can be somewhat smaller than the photon temperature ratio x = T /T if \u03b6 is large) [60,61]. Therefore, for \u03b6 100 and x 1/4 practically the whole budget of dark matter will be saturated by mirror neutrinos with mass \u223c1 keV leaving practically no space for mirror baryons. Therefore, in the following we assume that the mirror sector is cold enough to leave a space for mirror baryons as well. In any case, in what follows, we do not require that mirror baryons provide entire amount of DM, but we assume that it provides some fraction f of DM which we shall keep as an arbitrary parameter.",

            "text": "How large this fraction can be depends on the mass spectrum of the mirror particle and it is limited by the degree of self-interaction of mirror atoms. The self-scattering cross section of dark matter particles should satisfy the (most conservative) upper limit \u03c3/M < 10 \u221223 cm 2 /GeV [67,68]. For this, mirror atoms should be enough compact, with small enough mirror Bohr radius a = (\u03b1 m e ) \u22121 a/\u03b6 where we take m e m p and a = 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 cm is ordinary Bohr radius. In the case of mirror hydrogen this condition cannot be easily satisfied. The hydrogen atom has a long tail potential which in fact is responsible for molecular hydrogen as a bound state of two atoms. Therefore, the scattering cross section is resonantly amplified when the energy of scattering E gets close to the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule. One can parametrize this cross section as \u03c3 (E) = F(E)a 2 . At energies exceeding the atom binding energy, E \u2265 E 0 = \u03b1 2 m e /2, one has F(E) \u2264 1, but for E E 0 the crosssection strongly increases, and we have F(E) \u223c 100 or so [73]. Let us consider e.g. the case m p = 6 GeV for the dark proton mass which can be obtained when \u03b6 200. Then at typical virial velocities v \u223c 300 km/s characteristic for large galactic halos, we have E 3 keV, which is comparable to E 0 when m e = \u03b6 m e 100 MeV. However, in this case we get \u03c3/M a 2 /m p \u223c 10 \u221222 cm 2 /GeV which exceeds by an order of magnitude the above upper limit (a 2 /m p \u223c 3 \u00d7 10 \u221217 cm 2 /GeV for ordinary hydrogen). If we take instead \u03b6 = 2000, we get m e 1 GeV and m p 20 GeV or so. In this case we have E 10 keV against E 0 30 keV, so F(E) \u223c 10 and \u03c3/M 10a 2 /m p \u223c 3\u00d710 \u221224 cm 2 /GeV which can be acceptable for large halos, with v 300 km/s. Moreover, such a self interaction would smooth out the cusp providing a central density of halos of about 10 \u22122 M /pc 3 0.3 GeV/cm 3 [67,68]. However, for small halos, with e.g. v \u223c 30 km/s, we would have E E 0 and so F(E) \u2265 100 [73], and thus we would get \u03c3/M \u2265 3 \u00d7 10 \u221223 cm 2 /GeV, again larger than the above conservative upper limit. Therefore, in the cases discussed above mirror hydrogen cannot provide the entire amount of dark matter. In the case \u03b6 \u223c 10 2 it can be only a subdominant fraction (e.g. f \u223c 0.1) while the rest of dark matter can be represented e.g. by sterile mirror neutrinos with masses of few keV. In the case \u03b6 \u223c 10 3 mirror hydrogen could be a dominant fraction, say f 0.8 or so. However, it would be not effective for small dark matter halos (dwarf galaxies) and thus the latter must be formed essentially by mirror neutrinos constituting a small fraction, say 20 % or so of the whole amount of DM. This transition of DM content from large to small halos may provide an interesting explanation to the reduced amount of small substructures and \"too big to fail\" problems.",

In this case the ratio of two VEVs tan \u03b2 = H u / H d in mirror sector could be different from tan \u03b2 = H u / H d . In other words, up and down quark masses in the mirror sector will scale by different factors \u03b6 u = H u / H u and \u03b6 d = For the time being, tan \u03b2 is a free parameter for the MSSM or for the two Higgs model which formally can range from 1 to about 100 in ordinary sector. The case when tan \u03b2 = tan \u03b2, i.e. \u03b6 u = \u03b6 d = \u03b6 , was discussed above. However, if tan \u03b2 = tan \u03b2, other interesting options can appear. For example, taking \u03b6 u \u223c 10 2 and \u03b6 d \u223c 10 3 , which correspond to the case e.g. tan \u03b2 10 and tan \u03b2 1, we would have m e \u03b6 d m e 500 MeV. But now mirror upper quarks are rather light, m u \u223c 100m u \u223c 250 MeV, while mirror down quarks become very heavy m d \u223c 10 3 m d \u223c 5 GeV. In this case down quarks are unstable against \u03b2-decay even when they are bounded in hadrons, and thus the lightest baryon in mirror sector should exist in the form of ++ = u u u bound state with spin 3/2 and mirror electric charge +2, rather than in the form of the mirror proton. The mass of such baryon will be rescaled roughly as / 4 with respect to ordinary -resonances, M 1.2 GeV. On the other hand, because of charge +2, it must form a heliumlike atom with two electrons, having the mass M A \u223c 6 GeV or so. In this case the chemical neutrality of the helium gives an interesting indication for the self-scattering cross section. Taking into account that the helium atom radius is about 3/5 of the Bohr radius a = a/\u03b6 d , we obtain \u03c3 A A /M A 2 \u00d7 10 \u221224 cm 2 /GeV in excellent agreement with the self-scattering limits. Therefore, such exotic helium atom could constitute the entire dark matter in the galaxies and in the whole universe.",

In the third column the values of the related considered parameters are reported [11,14]; other choices are also possible as well as other halo models. The models of the Class C have also been considered including possible co-rotation and counter-rotation of the dark halo In this paper, we will consider a large (but not exhaustive) class of dark halo models, as already done in previous analyses for other DM candidates [11,[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]37,40]; these models are summarized in Table 1. An extensive discussion about some of the more credited realistic halo models has been reported in Refs. [11,14]. In particular, the considered classes of halo models correspond to: (1) spherically symmetric matter density with isotropic velocity dispersion (A); (2) spherically symmetric matter density with non-isotropic velocity dispersion (B); (3) axisymmetric models (C); (4) triaxial models (D); (5) moreover, in the case of axisymmetric models it is possible to include either an halo co-rotation or an halo counter-rotation.",

We will consider for \u03c1 dm , its minimal value \u03c1 min dm or its maximal one \u03c1 max dm , compatible with the given v 0 . The \u03c1 min dm and \u03c1 max dm are defined (as in Ref.

The particular values for \u03c1 min dm , \u03c1 max dm are related to the particular DF and the particular v 0 considered. See Table III of Ref. [11] for maximal densities at given v 0 and given model; for v 0 = 170 km/s \u03c1 dm ranges from 0.17 to 0.67 GeV cm \u22123 , while for v 0 = 220 km/s \u03c1 dm ranges from 0.29 to 1.11 GeV cm \u22123 , and for v 0 = 270 km/s \u03c1 dm ranges from 0.45 to 1.68 GeV cm \u22123 , depending on the halo model. Finally, we consider a DM escape velocity from the galactic gravitational potential v esc = 650 km/s, as often considered in literature; however, it is also affected by significant uncertainty. No sizeable differences are observed in the final results when a different value of v esc = 550 km/s is considered.",

A precise experimental determinations of these quantities are difficult for all kind of detectors. In fact, generally the direct measurements of quenching factors are performed with reference detectors, and -in some cases -with reference detectors having features quite different from the ones used in the underground running conditions; in other cases the quenching factors are not even measured at all. In addition it should be noted that the quenching factor value is a feature of each specific detector and not a fixed property of a given material. Moreover, the real nature of these measurements and the used neutron beam/sources may not point out all the possible contributions or instead may cause uncertainties because e.g. of the presence of spurious effects due to interactions with dead materials as e.g. housing or cryogenic assembling, if any; therefore, they are intrinsically more uncertain than generally derived. A discussion dedicated to the case of Na and I quenching factors in DAMA experiments has been given in section II of Ref. [37]; analogous / similar discussions should be pursued for every other case. In fact, the related uncertainties affect all the results both in terms of exclusion plots and in terms of allowed regions/volumes; thus, comparisons with a fixed set of assumptions and parameters values are intrinsically strongly uncertain.",

This effect can lead to an important deviation, in addition to the other uncertainties discussed above. In fact, the channeling effect in crystals implies that a fraction of nuclear recoils are channeled and experience much larger quenching factors than those derived from neutron calibration (see [19,37] for a discussion of these aspects). Since the channeling effect cannot be generally pointed out with neutron measurements as already discussed in details in Ref. [19], only modeling has been produced up to now. In particular, the modeling of the channeling effect described by DAMA in Ref. [19] is able to reproduce the recoil spectrum measured at neutron beam by some other groups (see Ref. [19] for details). For completeness, we mention an alternative channeling model, as that of Ref. [88], where larger probabilities of the planar channeling are expected. Moreover, we mention the analytic calculation claiming that the channeling effect holds for recoils coming from outside a crystal and not from recoils produced inside it, due to the blocking effect [89]. Nevertheless, although some amount of blocking effect could be present, the precise description of the crystal lattice with dopant and trace contaminants is quite difficult and analytical calculations require some simplifications which can affect the result. Because of the difficulties of experimental measurements and of theoretical estimate of this channeling effect, in the following it will be either included or not in order to give idea on the related uncertainty.",

It has also been recently addressed for the DM field in Refs. [94][95][96]. This effect consists in the ionization and the excitation of bound atomic electrons induced by the presence of a recoiling atomic nucleus. A detailed discussion of its impact in the corollary analyses in terms of some DM candidates is given in Ref. [18]. In this paper, the case of mirror nuclei interacting with the target nuclei is considered; thus, since the recoiling nucleus can \"shake off\" some of the atomic electrons, an electromagnetic contribution is present together with a recoil signal. Since this contribution is not quenched, one can expect that this part (usually unaccounted) can play a role, mainly when low mass DM candidates are considered; however, in the present case of mirror matter, one can expect second order corrections (of an order not exceeding 10 \u22121 on the expected counting rate) when the Migdal effect is accounted for.",

In this case the experimental observable is not -as in other experiments -the constant part of the signal, S 0 , but its modulation amplitude, S m , as a function of energy. This approach has several advantages; in particular, the only background of interest is the one able to mimic the signature, i.e. able to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the many specific peculiarities of this signature. No background of this sort has been found or suggested by anyone over more than a decade. Thus, this approach does not require any identification of S 0 from the total counting rate in order to establish the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo. Therefore, the DM annual modulation signature allows one to overcome the large uncertainties associated to: (1) the many data selections/subtractions/statistical-discrimination procedures; (2) the modeling of surviving background in keV region; (3) the a priori assumption on the nature, interaction type. etc. of the DM particle(s), which are necessary in the experiments where the experimental observable is S 0 .",

However, for simplicity the allowed regions in the parameters space (e.g. \u221a f in the DM model described in this paper) can also be calculated by comparing -for each k-th energy bin -the measured DM annual modulation amplitude S ex p m,k with the expectation in the considered framework, S th m,k . In this procedure one should remind that the measured counting rate in the cumulative energy spectrum -given by the sum of the constant background contribution b k and of the constant part of the signal S 0,k -is about 1 cpd/kg/keV in the lowest energy bins; in particular, as discussed e.g. in Ref. [97], this constant background is estimated to be not lower than \u223c0.75 cpd/kg/keV in the 2-4 keV energy region; thus, an upper limit on S 0 of \u223c0.25 cpd/kg/keV (S 0,max ) is derived. 6 To compare the expectations with the experimental results, the modulation amplitudes as function of energy [36] have been considered.

[98], in rotating protogalaxies the circular currents could emerge due the Rutherford-like scattering of the electrons with dark mirror particles in the dark matter halos, with cross-sections suppressed by a parameter . After a moderate dynamo amplification, these currents could give origin to the observed galactic magnetic fields of few \u03bcG with the coherence scales of order of 1 kpc. Photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing portal and search for mini-charged particles in whole is elusive for LHC and other precision experiments are needed for detecting their production in laboratory conditions.",
