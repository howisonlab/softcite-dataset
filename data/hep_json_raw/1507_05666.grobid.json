To reconstruct the distributions of kinematic observables we employ a matrix element technique that calculates the likelihood of the possible tt kinematic configurations. After accounting for the presence of background events and for calibration effects, we obtain a forward-backward asymmetry of A tt = (15.0 \u00b1 6.4 (stat) \u00b1 4.9 (syst))% and a top-quark polarization times spin analyzing power in the beam basis of \u03baP = (7.2 \u00b1 10.5 (stat) \u00b1 4.2 (syst))%, with a correlation of \u221256% between the measurements. If we constrain the forward-backward asymmetry to its expected standard model value, we obtain a measurement of the top polarization of \u03baP = (11.3\u00b19.1 (stat)\u00b11.9 (syst))%. If we constrain the top polarization to its expected standard model value, we measure a forward-backward asymmetry of A tt = (17.5 \u00b1 5.6 (stat) \u00b1 3.1 (syst))%. A combination with the D0 A tt measurement in the lepton+jets final state yields an asymmetry of A tt = (11.8 \u00b1 2.5 (stat) \u00b1 1.3 (syst))%. Within their respective uncertainties, all these results are consistent with the standard model expectations. ",

            "text": "In proton-antiproton collisions at \u221a s=1.96 TeV, top quark pairs are predominantly produced in valence quark-antiquark annihilations. The standard model (SM) predicts this process to be slightly forwardbackward asymmetric: the top quark (antiquark) tends to be emitted in the same direction as the incoming quark (antiquark), and thus, in the same direction as the incoming proton (antiproton). The forward-backward asymmetry in the production is mainly due to positive contributions from the interference between tree-level and * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c DESY, Hamburg, Germany, d CONACyT, Mexico City, Mexico, e SLAC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, f University College London, London, UK, next-to-leading-order (NLO) box diagrams. It receives smaller negative contributions from the interference between initial and final state radiation. The interferences with electroweak processes increase the asymmetry. In the SM, the asymmetry is predicted to be \u2248 10% [1][2][3]. Within the SM, the longitudinal polarizations of the top quark and antiquark are due to parity violating electroweak contributions to the production process. The polarization is expected to be < 0.5% for all choices of the spin quantization axis [4,5].",

We first reconstruct the \u2206y tt and cos \u03b8 \u00b1 distributions employing a matrix element integration technique similar to that used for the top-quark mass measurement in the dilepton channel [20]. These distributions are used to extract raw measurements of asymmetry and polarization, A tt raw and \u03baP raw , in data. The experimental observables A tt raw and \u03baP raw are correlated because of acceptance and resolution effects. Using a mc@nlo [21,22] simulation, we compute the relation between the raw measurements A tt raw and \u03baP raw , and the true parton-level asymmetry and polarization to determine calibration corrections. We then extract the final measured values of A tt and \u03baP . This is the first measurement of the tt forward-backward asymmetry obtained from the reconstructed \u2206y tt distribution in the dilepton channel and the first measurement of the top quark polarization at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.",

Each of the dilepton channels is subject to a different mixture and level of background contamination, in particular for the background arising from the Z \u2192 \u2113\u2113 process.

Since this \u2206y tt distribution is an approximate estimation of the true distribution of \u2206y tt , the raw asymmetry A tt raw is an approximation of the true A tt . The measurement therefore needs to be calibrated. The calibration is discussed below. The use of an event-by-event likelihood function allows us to define an asymmetry observable for each event",

Uncertainties affecting the signal are obtained by deriving calibration coefficients from alternate signal models and propagating them to the final results. Uncertainties affecting the background have an impact on the raw measurements, A tt raw and \u03baP raw , as these observables are obtained after subtracting the background. They are propagated to the final measurement by applying the nominal calibration correction to the modified A tt raw and \u03baP raw . The third category consists of the uncertainties on the calibration method. Since the measurement is performed after background subtraction, the calibration is independent of the normalization of the tt simulation, and there is no systematic uncertainty due to signal normalization. The uncertainties on A tt and \u03baP due to the different sources are summarized in Table VII, together with the correlations.",

To propagate uncertainty on the simulation of initial state and final state radiations (ISR/FSR), the amount of radiation is varied by scaling the ktfac parameter either by a factor of 1.5 or 1/1.5 in an alpgen+pythia simulation of tt events [50]. The hadronization and parton-shower model uncertainty is derived from the difference between the pythia and herwig generators, estimated by comparing alpgen+herwig to alpgen+pythia tt samples. The different models for parton showers used by various MC generators yield different amounts of ISR between forward and backward events [57,58]. The uncertainty on the ISR model is defined as 50% of the difference between the nominal results and the results derived from a mc@nlo simulation in which the dependence of the forward-backward asymmetry on the p T of the tt system is removed. The uncertainty of 0.94 GeV on m t [40] is propagated to the final result using two alpgen+pythia samples generated with different m t values. We determine PDF uncertainties by varying the 20 parameters describing the CTEQ6M1 PDF [35] within their uncertainties.",
