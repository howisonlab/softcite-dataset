The study is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded by LHCb. A structure at m\u00f0D 0 K \u2212 \u00de \u2248 2.86 GeV=c 2 is found to be an admixture of spin-1 and spin-3 resonances. The masses and widths of these states and of the D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 meson are measured, as are the complex amplitudes and fit fractions for all theD 0 K \u2212 and K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe components included in the amplitude model. In addition, the D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 resonance is confirmed to be spin 2.",

            "text": "Several recent experimental discoveries have reinvigorated the field of heavy meson spectroscopy. Among the most interesting are the observations of the D \u00c3 s0 \u00f02317\u00de \u2212 [1] and D s1 \u00f02460\u00de \u2212 [2] states. In contrast to prior predictions, these are below the DK and D \u00c3 K thresholds, respectively, and hence are narrow. The D \u00c3 s0 \u00f02317\u00de \u2212 and D s1 \u00f02460\u00de \u2212 states are usually interpreted [3] as two of the orbitally excited (1P) states, the other two being the long-established D s1 \u00f02536\u00de \u2212 and D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 resonances, though the reason for the large mass splitting between the mesons below and above the D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de K thresholds is not fully understood. Further interest in the field has been generated by the discovery of several D \u2212 sJ states with masses above that of the D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 resonance through production in e \u00fe e \u2212 [4,5] or pp [6] collisions.

The 2S family is a doublet with spin-parity quantum numbers J P \u00bc 0 \u2212 , 1 \u2212 , while there are four 1D states with J P \u00bc 1 \u2212 , 2 \u2212 , 2 \u2212 , 3 \u2212 . Among these, only resonances with natural spin parity \u00f00 \u00fe ; 1 \u2212 ; 2 \u00fe ; 3 \u2212 ; \u2026\u00de can decay to two pseudoscalar mesons. If the 2S and 1D J P \u00bc 1 \u2212 states are close in mass, they may mix. In the literature, the D \u00c3 s1 \u00f02700\u00de \u2212 is usually interpreted as being the 1 \u2212 2S state, while the D \u00c3 sJ \u00f02860\u00de \u2212 is a candidate to be the 3 \u2212 1D state [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. However, several papers (e.g., Ref. [16]) point out that the D \u00c3 sJ \u00f02860\u00de \u2212 could be the 1D 1 \u2212 state, or, more generally, if the D \u00c3 s1 \u00f02700\u00de \u2212 is interpreted as an admixture of 2S and 1D 1 \u2212 states, the D \u00c3 sJ \u00f02860\u00de \u2212 could be its orthogonal partner. Several authors (e.g., Ref. [17]) point out that the observed relative rates of D \u00c3 sJ \u00f02860\u00de \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3 K and D \u00c3 sJ \u00f02860\u00de \u2212 \u2192 DK decays suggest that the observed signal for the former may include additional contributions from states with unnatural parity such as the 2 \u2212 1D states. Other authors have considered the possibility that the observed states may have a significant component from multiquark states (tetraquarks or molecules) [18][19][20]. For detailed reviews, see Refs. [21][22][23][24].",

Although candidates for spin-1 and spin-2 1D cc and bb states have been reported [3,25,26], no spin-3 meson involving a c or b quark has previously been observed. Production of high-spin states is expected to be suppressed in B meson decay due to the angular momentum barrier [27], and indeed has never yet been observed. However, as the decays of high-spin resonances are suppressed for the same reason, they are expected to have relatively small widths, potentially enhancing their observability.",

Analyses by the Belle [29,30] and BABAR [31] collaborations of B \u2192 D\u03c0\u03c0 decays have provided insight into the orbitally excited charm mesons. Such analyses complement those on inclusive production of charm mesons [32][33][34] as the lower background allows broader states to be distinguished and the well-defined initial state allows the quantum numbers to be unambiguously determined. These advantages compensate to some extent for the smaller samples that are available from B meson decay compared to inclusive production.",

            "text": "Until now, few results on charm-strange meson spectroscopy have become available from Dalitz plot analyses, because the available samples of such mesons from B \u00fe and B 0 decays are much smaller than those of nonstrange charm mesons. An exception is a study of B \u00fe \u2192 D 0D0 K \u00fe decays by Belle [35], which produced the first observation of the D \u00c3 s1 \u00f02700\u00de \u2212 meson and showed that it has J P \u00bc 1 \u2212 . Copious samples of charm-strange mesons are, however, available from decays of B 0 s mesons produced at high energy hadron colliders. These have been exploited to study the properties of the D s1 \u00f02536\u00de \u2212 [36] and D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 [37] states produced in semileptonic B 0 s decays. Production of orbitally excited charm-strange mesons has also been seen in hadronic B 0 s decays [38]. In this paper, the first Dalitz plot analysis of the B 0 s \u2192D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe decay is presented. TheD 0 meson is reconstructed through the K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode, which is treated as flavor specific; i.e., the heavily suppressed",

Previously the resonant contribution from B 0 s \u2192D 0K\u00c3 \u00f0892\u00de 0 has been observed [39], and the inclusive three-body branching fraction has been measured [40]. In this work the contributions from excited charmstrange mesons and excited kaon states are separated from each other with the amplitude analysis technique. The results are important not only from the point of view of spectroscopy, but also as they will provide input to future studies of CP violation. In particular, the angle \u03b3 of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity triangle [41,42] can be determined from studies of CP violation in B 0 \u2192D 0 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [43][44][45]. In such analyses, B 0 s decays provide both an important control channel and a potential source of background (see, e.g., Refs. [46,47]).",

This is, however, the first time that such an analysis has been performed by LHCb with a decay into a fully hadronic final state (i.e., without muons). The paper is organized as follows. A brief description of the LHCb detector as well as reconstruction and simulation software is given in Sec. II. The selection of signal candidates and the fit to the B 0 s candidate invariant mass distribution used to separate signal and background are described in Secs. III and IV, respectively. An overview of the Dalitz plot analysis formalism and a definition of the square Dalitz plot (SDP) are given in Sec. V, and details of the implementation of the amplitude analysis are presented in Sec. VI. The evaluation of systematic uncertainties is described in Sec. VII. The results are given in Sec. VIII, and a summary concludes the paper in Sec. IX. The highlights of the analysis are described in a shorter companion paper [56].",

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum, p, to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and an impact parameter (IP) measurement with a resolution of 20 \u03bcm for charged particles with large momentum transverse to the beamline, p T [60].

Signal candidates are accepted offline if one of the final state particles created a cluster in the hadronic calorimeter with sufficient transverse energy to fire the hardware trigger. Events that are triggered at the hardware level by another particle in the event are also retained. After all selection requirements are imposed, 62% of events in the sample are triggered by the signal candidate and 58% are triggered by another particle in the event including 20% that are triggered independently by both by the signal candidate and by another particle. The software trigger requires a two-, three-, or four-track secondary vertex with a large sum of the p T of the tracks and a significant displacement from any of the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs).

The complex amplitudes of these are determined, and fit fractions and interference fit fractions are reported in addition, to enable conventionindependent comparisons of the model. The fit fraction results are converted into branching fraction measurements. The result for B\u00f0B 0 s \u2192D 0K\u00c3 \u00f0892\u00de 0 \u00de is significantly more precise than the previous measurement [39], which was obtained from a much smaller and statistically independent data sample collected by LHCb during 2010.

The mass and width of this state are determined with significantly better precision than previous measurements [3]. The result for the width is consistent with the previous world average. The result for the mass, however, is somewhat below the previous average, which is dominated by a measurement by the BABAR collaboration [4] based on inclusive production in e \u00fe e \u2212 collisions. The Dalitz plot analysis technique used in this paper ensures that the background under the D \u00c3 s2 \u00f02573\u00de \u2212 peak is small and does not contain large contributions from decays of higher D \u2212 s resonances, resulting in much lower systematic uncertainties on the measured parameters compared to the inclusive approach.",
