Charged Higgs bosons are assumed to be pairproduced and to decay into qq, \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 or AW \u00b1 * . No signal is observed. Model-independent limits on the charged Higgsboson production cross section are derived by combining these results with previous searches at lower energies. Under the assumption BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 ) + BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 qq) = 1, motivated by general 2HDM type II models, excluded areas on the [m H \u00b1 , BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 )] plane are presented and charged Higgs bosons are excluded up to a mass of 76.",

While the SM accurately describes the interactions between elementary particles, it leaves several fundamental questions unanswered. Therefore, it is of great interest to study extended models.",

The likelihood output gives the probability that a given event belongs to the signal rather than to one of the two background sources.",

The event topologies are therefore \"eight jets\" or \"six jets and a lepton with missing energy\", with four jets containing b-flavor in both cases. When plotting the likelihood output, the signal expectation is scaled up by a factor of 10 for better visibility. A hadronic branching ratio of 0.5 is assumed for the 2j + \u03c4 signal, and 1.0 for the 4j signal. The reconstructed mass distributions are shown after the likelihood selection corresponds to a different likelihood selection optimized for the mass at which the dot is centered.

The Monte Carlo description of the neural network output was checked with LEP1 data with a jet energy of about 46 GeV. The main background in this search at LEP2 comes from four-fermion processes, in which the mean jet energy is about 50 GeV, very close to the LEP1 jet energy; therefore, an adequate modeling of the background is expected with the events reconstructed as four jets.

At low m H \u00b1 , the A and W \u00b1 * bosons might have a boost, but it is still not possible to resolve correctly the two partons from their decay. From these considerations, one can conclude that it is not useful to require eight (or even six) jets in the event, as these jets will not correspond to the original partons.

This can partly be explained by the apparent difference between the gluon splitting rate into cc and bb pairs in the data and in the background Monte Carlo simulation. The measured rates at \u221a s = 91 GeV are g cc = 3.2 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.38 % [50] and g bb = 0.307 \u00b1 0.053 \u00b1 0.097 % [51] from the LEP1 OPAL data. The gluon splitting rates in our Monte Carlo simulation are extracted from e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 + \u2212 qq events, where the Z \u2192 qq decays have similar kinematic properties to the ones in the LEP1 measurement. Note that e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 qqqq events can not be used as the two qq pairs interact strongly with each other. The rates are found to be g MC cc = 1.33 \u00b1 0.06 % and g MC bb = 0.116 \u00b1 0.0167 %, averaged over all center-of-mass energies. This mismodeling can be compensated by reweighting the SM Monte Carlo events with gluon splitting to heavy quarks and at the same time deweighting the non-split events to keep the total numbers of W + W \u2212 , ZZ and two-fermion background events fixed at generator level. The reweighting factor is 2.41 for g \u2192 cc and 2.65 for g \u2192 bb. The same reweighting factors are used for W + W \u2212 , ZZ and two-fermion events with gluon splitting at all LEP2 energies, noting that all background samples were hadronized with the same settings and assuming that the \u221a s dependence of the gluon splitting of a fragmenting two-fermion system is correctly modeled by the Monte Carlo generator. It is known that the generator reproduces the energy dependence predicted by QCD in the order \u03b1 s with resummed leading-log and next-to-leading log terms [52]. This correction results in a background enhancement factor of 1.08 to 1.1 after the preselection, depending on the search channel and the center-of-mass energy, but it does not affect the shape of the background distributions.",

At this stage of the analysis the 8j and 6j + data samples are highly over-lapping. The observed rates still show an excess over the background predictions, adding up to about 1.6 standard deviations in both samples. Although this difference is statistically not significant, it can be shown that the Monte Carlo prediction has minor imperfections. For the 8j case, the distributions of three variables used in the analysis, namely y 34 , y 56 and B evt , are plotted in the right part of Fig. 3. As can be seen, the variable y 56 is most powerful to reject the background. Both the y 34 and the y 56 distributions are slightly shifted towards the position of a hypothetical Higgs signal and the B evt distribution shows an excess over the predicted background at intermediate B evt values, but the excess events are not distributed according to the expectation for a Higgs signal. The shifts are visible with better statistical significance in the left part of Fig. 3. It shows the same variables for a background enriched data sample, where the preselection cuts on y 34 and B evt are dropped, except for the study of the y 56 variable where we keep the cut on y 34 to select multijet events. The resulting samples are completely dominated by background, the contribution of a Higgs signal being at most 0.5 %. Since heavy quark production in the Monte Carlo generator is already corrected, the origin of the discrepancies is likely a slight mismodeling of the topology of multi-jet events, especially if they contain heavy quarks. No further correction is applied to the estimated background. Excess events passing the final selection, even if they do not look signal-like, are thus counted with a certain weight as signal events in the statistical analysis, to be discussed later.",

If an event falls into class (iii), the larger likelihood output of the two selections is kept for further processing. The final results using the above classification are quoted in Table 4. After all selection cuts, an excess of events appears in the 1999 data sample. The excess (1.9\u03c3 ) is not statistically significant and it is consistent with the results of the other years. This modified channel definition not only removes the overlap but also increases the efficiency for detecting signal events by considering the cross-channel efficiencies (e.g. the efficiency to select H + H \u2212 \u2192 bbqqbbqq signal by the exclusive 6j + selection can be as high as 18 %, though it is typically only a few %). The efficiencies are determined independently for all simulated (m H \u00b1 , m A ) combinations and interpolated to arbitrary (m H \u00b1 , m A ) by two-dimensional spline interpolation. The behavior of the selection efficiencies depends strongly on the targeted charged Higgs-boson mass range and also varies with the mass difference m = m H \u00b1 \u2212 m A . In most cases the overlap channel has the highest efficiency. At \u221a s = 189 GeV and m H \u00b1 = 45 GeV, it reaches 32 % for the bbqqbb \u03bd and 44 % for the H + H \u2212 \u2192 bbqqbbqq signal. At \u221a s = 206 GeV and m H \u00b1 = 90 GeV, the overlap efficiency can be as high as 62 % for the bbqqbb \u03bd and 71 % for the H + H \u2212 \u2192 bbqqbbqq signal. The exclusive 6j + se-  the Higgs bosons are boosted and therefore the final state is two-jet-like with the largest background contribution coming from two-fermion processes: they account for 52 % in the exclusive 8j, 80 % in the exclusive 6j + and 76 % in the overlap channel. On the other hand, in the high-mass analysis ( \u221a s = 192-209 GeV) the four-fermion fraction is dominant: 69 % in the 8j, 56 % in the 6j + and 70 % in the overlap channel. Table 6 Relative systematic uncertainties in percent for the AW + * AW \u2212 * searches. Where two values are given separated by a \"/\", the first belongs to the 189 GeV selection and the second to the 192-209 GeV selections. For the signal, the uncertainties due to the limited Monte Carlo statistics are calculated by binomial statistics for a sample size of 500 events and they also depend, via the selection efficiency, on the assumed Higgs-boson  Systematic errors arise from uncertainties in the preselection and from mismodeling of the likelihood function. The variables y 34 and B evt appear both in the preselection cuts and in the likelihood definition. The total background rate is known to be underestimated after the preselection step. The computation of upper limits on the production cross section, with this background rate subtracted, results in conservative limits, assuming the modeling of the other preselection variables and the signal and background likelihoods to be correct. Therefore, no systematic uncertainty is assigned to the percentage of events passing the y 34 and B evt preselection cuts. The systematic errors related to preselection variables other than y 34 and B evt , evaluated from background enriched data samples, are taken into account.",

The results presented here and those published previously [16,44] by the OPAL Collaboration  are combined using the method of [56] to study the compatibility of the observed events with \"background-only\" and \"signal plus background\" hypotheses and to derive limits on charged Higgs-boson production. The statistical analysis is based on weighted event counting, with the weights computed from physical observables, also called discriminating variables of the candidate events (see Table 8). Systematic uncertainties with correlations are taken into account in the confidence level (p-value) calculations. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis, they are also incorporated into the weight definition [56].  Fig. 7(d). The combined results are shown by \"isolines\" along which \u03c3 95 (H + H \u2212 )/\u03c3 2HDM , the ratio of the limit on the production cross section and the 2HDM cross-section prediction, is equal to the number indicated next to the curves.

The expected mass limit from simulated background experiments, assuming no signal, is also shown. For the combined results, the 90 % and 99 % CL contours are also given. Charged Higgs bosons are excluded up to a mass of 76.3 GeV at 95 % CL, independent of BR(H \u00b1 \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 ). Lower mass limits for different values of BR(H \u00b1 \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 ) are presented in Table 9.",

Charged Higgsboson pair production is excluded below 40 GeV by the measurement of the Z boson width [57]. As the A boson detection is based on the identification of b-quark jets, no limits are derived for m A < 2m b . Both the fermionic (2\u03c4 , 2j + \u03c4 and 4j) and the bosonic (4j + \u03c4 , 6j + and 8j) final states play an important role and therefore their results have to be combined.

Therefore, an automatic procedure is implemented to switch off the less sensitive of the overlapping channels, based on the calculation of the expected limit assuming no signal. In general the fermionic channels are used close to the (m H \u00b1 , m A ) diagonal and for low tan \u03b2, and the searches for H \u00b1 \u2192 AW \u00b1 * are crucial for low values of m A and high values of tan \u03b2.",

For intermediate and large values of tan \u03b2, the boundary lines of the excluded mass regions have two local m H \u00b1 minima. The first minimum at m A = 12 GeV is due to the excess of events in the AW + * AW \u2212 * searches. The second minimum is at a region extending parallel to the (m H \u00b1 , m A ) diagonal (see the full and dotted black curves corresponding to a crosssection ratio of 1.0). This reflects the loss of sensitivity in the AW + * AW \u2212 * searches for mass combinations without a pronounced 8j or 6j + structure and is also due to the channel switching procedure implemented to avoid the use of overlapping events as explained above.",
