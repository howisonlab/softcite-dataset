This final state is highly sensitive to high-tan \u03b2 or higgsino-like scenarios in which decays of electroweak gauginos to tau leptons are dominant. The search uses a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb \u22121 , which was recorded with the CMS detector during 2016 and 2017. No significant excess is observed with respect to the background prediction. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are presented in the top squark and lightest neutralino mass plane within the framework of simplified models, in which top squark masses up to 1100 GeV are excluded for a nearly massless neutralino.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] is one of the most widely studied theories of physics beyond the standard model (SM), providing solutions to various shortcomings of the SM. In SUSY models there is a bosonic superpartner for each fermion (and vice-versa), the superpartner having the same quantum numbers, other than spin, as its SM partner. The superpartners of the SM gauge and Higgs bosons (gauginos and higgsinos, respectively) mix to produce charginos and neutralinos. The weakly interacting lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 can be a dark matter candidate in R-parity conserving SUSY models [10]. The SUSY partners of leftand right-handed top quarks are the top squarks, t L and t R . These particles can mix with each other, resulting in physical states t 1 and t 2 , with t 1 defined to be the lighter of the two. The top squarks play an important role in stabilizing the Higgs boson mass by canceling the dominant top quark loop correction. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to perform searches for top squark production.",

            "text": "In this study, we focus on the signal of top squark pair production in a final state with two tau leptons. This probes the part of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) in which the lightest charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and neutralino preferentially couple to third-generation fermions, such as tau leptons. The interaction of JHEP02(2020)015 the charginos and neutralinos with fermion-sfermion pairs involves both gauge and Yukawa terms [9], so if charginos and neutralinos are predominantly higgsino-like, they will preferentially couple to third-generation fermion-sfermion pairs through the large Yukawa coupling. Moreover, the Yukawa coupling to the tau lepton-slepton pairs can be large for a high value of tan \u03b2 even if the higgsino component is relatively small. Additionally, a large value of tan \u03b2 can make the lighter state of the superpartner of the tau lepton ( \u03c4 1 ) much lighter than the superpartners of the first and second generation leptons. Consequently, the chargino decays predominantly as \u03c7 + 1 \u2192 \u03c4 + 1 \u03bd \u03c4 or \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 (charge conjugation is assumed throughout in this paper), and the decay rates in the electron and muon channels are greatly reduced [11,12]. Therefore, searches for SUSY signals in electron and muon channels are less sensitive to this scenario.",

The \u03c7 0 1 is assumed to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). Being neutral and weakly interacting, it leaves no signature in the detector, resulting in an imbalance in transverse momentum p T . The neutrinos produced in the decay chains also contribute to the p T imbalance. Hence, the events of interest contain two tau leptons, two b quarks, and a p T imbalance. The decay chains are depicted by the four diagrams in figure 1 within the simplified model spectra (SMS) framework [13,14]. It is assumed that the \u03c7 + 1 decays to \u03c4 + 1 or \u03bd \u03c4 with equal probability. This search is performed using proton-proton collision events at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities of 35.9 and 41.3 fb \u22121 collected during the 2016 and 2017 operating periods of the LHC, respectively. Signal-like events are characterized by the presence of hadronically decaying tau leptons (\u03c4 h ), jets identified as likely to have JHEP02(2020)015 originated from the fragmentation of b quarks, and large missing p T . Contributions from SM processes with the same final state are estimated using a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples and control samples in data.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [29].",

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found in simulation to be, on average, within 5-10% of the generated momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute spurious tracks and calorimetric energy deposits, increasing the apparent jet momentum. In order to mitigate this effect, tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset is applied to correct for the remaining contributions [52]. Jets are calibrated using both simulation and data studies [52]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove those potentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures [53]. Jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are used in this analysis.",

The search was performed in the final state containing an oppositely charged hadronic tau lepton pair, at least one jet identified as likely to originate from the fragmentation of a b quark, and missing transverse momentum. The dominant standard model backgrounds were found to originate from top quark pair production and processes where jets were misidentified as hadronic tau lepton decays. Control samples in data were used to estimate these backgrounds, while other backgrounds were estimated using simulation.",

The requirements on p miss T and the number of b-tagged jets (n b ) help to reduce the contributions from DY+jets and SM events comprised uniquely of jets produced through the strong interaction, referred to as multijet events. Distributions of the variables p miss T , m T2 , and H T after this selection are shown in figure 2 for data and the predicted background, along with representative signal distributions.
