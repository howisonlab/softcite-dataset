            "text": "The study of the production of hadrons containing heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at LHC energies provides a way to test, in a new energy domain, calculations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes based on the factorization approach. In this scheme, cross sections are computed as a convolution of three terms: the parton distribution functions of the incoming protons, the partonic hard scattering cross section calculated as a perturbative series in the strong interaction coupling constant, and the fragmentation function, parametrizing the relative production yield and momentum distribution for a charm quark hadronizing to a particular species of D meson. Recent implementations of such calculations, at the perturbation level of next-to-leading order or at fixed order with next-to-leading-log resummation (FONLL) [1,2] describe well the beauty production cross section measured in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV at the FNAL Tevatron collider [3][4][5] and in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [6,7]. The production cross section of charmed hadrons (D mesons) at Tevatron is reproduced within the theoretical uncertainties of the calculations as well [8][9][10]. However, the comparison suggests that charm production is underestimated by the results obtained with the central values of the calculation parameters, as observed also in pp collisions at the BNL RHIC collider at the lower energy of \u221a s = 200 GeV [11][12][13]. In this context, it is particularly interesting to perform the comparison for charm production at the LHC energy, which is more than three times higher than at the Tevatron. Furthermore, at LHC energies, the measurement of charm production in the low transverse JHEP01(2012)128 momentum (p t ) region probes the parton distribution functions of the proton at small values of parton fractional momentum x and squared momentum transfer Q 2 . For illustration, using a simplified 2 \u2192 2 kinematics at leading order, c quarks (m c \u2248 1.5 GeV/c 2 ) with p t \u223c 2 GeV/c and rapidity y \u223c 0 probe the parton distribution functions at x \u223c 7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and Q 2 \u223c (5 GeV) 2 , where the gluon component is dominant. In this kinematic regime, the gluon distribution may reach the level of saturation, leading to a measurable departure of the observed cross sections from the expectations based on the factorization approach (see e.g. [14]). We report on the measurement of the production cross section of the prompt charmed mesons D 0 , D + , and D * + , in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, reconstructed in the range 1 < p t < 24 (16 for D 0 ) GeV/c and |y| < 0.5 with the ALICE experimental apparatus [15], using data collected in 2010. The detector layout and the data sample used for the measurement are described in section 2. The D meson reconstruction procedure, the raw yield extraction, and the corrections applied to obtain the production cross sections, including the estimation of the prompt D meson fraction, are presented in sections 3 and 4. Finally, the resulting p t -differential cross sections are reported in section 4.3 and compared to QCD predictions.",

It consists of a central barrel covering the pseudorapidity interval |\u03b7| < 0.9, a forward muon spectrometer, and a set of small detectors in the forward regions for trigger and event characterization purposes. Only the detector features that are relevant for the D meson analysis are presented here.

The particle identification is based on the difference between the measured time-of-flight and its expected value, computed for each mass hypothesis from the track momentum and length. The overall resolution on this difference is about 160 ps. In this analysis, the time-of-flight measurement provides kaon/pion separation up to a momentum of about 1.5 GeV/c.

The minimum-bias trigger was based on the SPD and VZERO detectors. The VZERO detector consists of two arrays of 32 scintillators each, placed around the beam vacuum tube on either side of the interaction region. The two arrays cover the pseudorapidity ranges \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 and 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1. Minimum-bias collisions were triggered by requiring at least one hit in either of the VZERO counters or in the SPD (|\u03b7| < 2), in coincidence with the arrival of proton bunches from both directions. This trigger was estimated to be sensitive to about 87% of the pp inelastic cross section [20,21]. It was verified on Monte Carlo simulations based on the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [22] (with Perugia-0 tuning [23]) that the minimum-bias trigger is 100% efficient for D mesons with p t > 1 GeV/c and |y| < 0.5. Contamination from beaminduced background was rejected offline using the timing information from the VZERO and the correlation between the number of hits and track segments (tracklets) in the SPD detector. The instantaneous luminosity in the ALICE experiment was limited to 0.6-1.2 \u00d7 10 29 cm \u22122 s \u22121 by displacing the beams in the transverse plane by 3.8 times the r.m.s of their transverse profile. In this way, the interaction probability per bunch crossing was kept in the range 0.04-0.08, with probability of collision pile-up below 4% per triggered event. The luminous region was measured with high precision from the distribution of the interaction vertices reconstructed from the charged particles tracked in the ALICE central barrel detectors, yielding \u03c3 luminous",

Their decay secondary vertices are therefore typically displaced by a few hundred \u00b5m from the primary vertex of the pp interaction. The analysis strategy for the extraction of the D 0 and D + signals from the large combinatorial background due to uncorrelated tracks is based on the reconstruction and selection of secondary vertex topologies that have significant separation from the primary vertex. The identification of the charged kaons in the TPC and TOF detectors provides additional background rejection in the low-momentum region. A particle identification strategy that has high efficiency for the D meson signal (see section 4.1) was adopted. Finally, an invariant mass analysis was used to extract the signal yield. In the D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + case, the decay vertex cannot be resolved from the primary vertex. The analysis exploits topological selections on the D 0 , together with the sharp peak in the difference between the invariant mass of the three final state hadrons and that of the two -4 -",

The same algorithm is used to search for vertices from pile-up collisions starting from the tracklets that do not point to the first found vertex. An event is rejected from the analyzed data sample if a second interaction vertex is found, it has at least 3 associated tracklets, and it is separated from the first one by more than 8 mm. The remaining undetected pile-up is negligible for the analysis described in this paper. Track seeds are built using this first estimate of the interaction vertex position together with pairs of reconstructed space points in adjacent readout pad rows of the TPC. Tracks are then projected inward in the radial direction using a Kalman filter algorithm, incorporating space points in the TPC and then hits in the six layers of the ITS (referred to here as TPC+ITS tracks). The ITS hits not associated to TPC+ITS tracks by this procedure are then used to search for ITS-only tracks, most importantly to recover pions with 80 < p t < 200 MeV/c that have very low reconstruction efficiency in the TPC, for geometrical reasons. ITS-only tracks are found using a hit grouping algorithm that projects angular windows radially outward from the primary vertex. The TPC+ITS tracks are then propagated outward in order to associate signals in the large-radius detectors that perform particle identification. Finally, all tracks are re-propagated with the Kalman filter in the inward direction. The relative p t resolution at the primary vertex for this procedure is about 1% (6%) at 1 GeV/c for TPC+ITS (ITS-only) tracks. The last step of event reconstruction is the re-determination of the primary vertex position from the accepted tracks [26]. The primary vertex coordinates and covariance matrix are obtained via an analytic \u03c7 2 minimization method applied to the tracks approximated by straight lines after propagation to their common point of closest approach. The algorithm is then repeated excluding the tracks with distance to the primary vertex, normalized to its estimated uncertainty, larger than 3, which are incompatible with being produced by primary particles. The vertex fit is constrained in the transverse plane using the information on the position and spread \u03c3 luminous",

Secondary vertices of D 0 and D + meson candidates were reconstructed using tracks having |\u03b7| < 0.8, p t > 0.4 GeV/c, at least 70 associated space points (out of a maximum of 159) and \u03c7 2 /ndf < 2 in the TPC, and at least one hit in either of the two layers of the SPD. For tracks passing this selection, the average number of hits in the six ITS layers is 4.5-4.7, depending on the data taking period. This quantity is influenced by the fraction of inactive channels and its distribution is well reproduced in Monte Carlo simulations. For the D * + soft pion, all TPC+ITS and ITS-only tracks with at least 4 hits in the ITS, including at least one in the SPD, and p t > 80 MeV/c were considered. Figure 1 shows the transverse momentum dependence of the transverse (r\u03c6) impact parameter (d 0 ) resolution achieved with the present ITS alignment precision for tracks that satisfy the TPC and ITS selection criteria, for data and Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations utilize GEANT3 [27] and incorporate a detailed description of the detector material, geometry and response. Proton-proton collisions were simulated using the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [22] with Perugia-0 tuning [23]. The impact parameter resolution was estimated by fitting the inclusive distribution of d 0 with respect to the event primary vertex, in intervals of p t . The fit function is the sum of a Gaussian, that accounts for the component due to prompt particles produced at the primary vertex, and two exponential functions, that account for secondary particles, mainly from weak decays of strange hadrons. The width \u03c3 of the Gaussian provides an estimate of the d 0 resolution, which includes the resolution of the track parameters and the primary vertex position. In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of d 0 , the primary vertex is recalculated excluding the track being probed. The figure shows that the d 0 resolution measured in data, with values of 75 (20) \u00b5m at p t = 1 (15) GeV/c, is reproduced within about 10% by the Monte Carlo simulation incorporating the residual ITS misalignment described in section 2. The effect of the difference between data and simulation on the results of the D meson analysis is discussed in section 4.2.",

In order to assign the kaon or pion mass to the decay tracks, compatibility cuts were applied to the difference between the measured and expected signals. For both dE/dx and time-of-flight, a 3 \u03c3 compatibility cut was used. Tracks without a TOF signal were identified using only the TPC information, and tracks with incompatible TOF and TPC indications were treated as non-identified, but still used in the analysis and considered to be compatible with both a pion and a kaon. Two-prong candidates were accepted (as D 0 , D 0 , or both) or rejected, according to the compatibility with the K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 final state. For D 0 candidates used in D * + reconstruction, compatibility with the appropriate final state, consistent with the soft pion charge, was required. Particle identification was not applied to the soft pion tracks. In the case of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay, the particle with the opposite charge sign with respect to the D meson is a kaon. Hence, the triplets were rejected if the opposite sign track was not compatible with the kaon hypothesis, or at least one of the two same sign tracks was not compatible with the pion hypothesis. For all three D meson species, a comparison of the invariant mass distributions obtained without and with particle identification shows that this selection reduces the combinatorial background by a factor 2-3 in the low p t region, while preserving close to 100% of the D meson signal.",

In the D 0 case, the contribution of signal candidates with wrong mass assignment to the final state hadrons is also present in the invariant mass spectrum.

The factor 1/2 accounts for the fact that the measured yields include particles and anti-particles while the cross sections are given for particles only. The integrated luminosity was computed as L int = N pp,MB /\u03c3 pp,MB , where N pp,MB and \u03c3 pp,MB are the number and the cross section, respectively, of pp collisions passing the minimum-bias trigger condition defined in section 2. The \u03c3 pp,MB value, 62.5 mb, was derived from a measurement using a van der Meer scan [28] of the cross section of collisions that give signals in both sides of the VZERO scintillator detector (\u03c3 VZERO-AND ) [20,21]. The normalization factor, \u03c3 pp,VZERO-AND /\u03c3 pp,MB \u2248 0.87, was found to be stable within 1% in the data sample. The uncertainty on \u03c3 pp,MB is determined by the systematic uncertainty of 3.5% on \u03c3 VZERO-AND , which is due to the uncertainties on the beam intensities [29] and on the analysis procedure related to the van der Meer scan of the signal. The rapidity acceptance correction, using the factor 2 y fid , with y fid varying from 0.5 at low p t to 0.8 at high p t , assumes that the rapidity distribution of D mesons is uniform in the range |y| < y fid . This assumption was checked using the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [22] with Perugia-0 tuning [23] and the FONLL pQCD calculation [1,2,30], both of which generate a D meson yield that is uniform within 1% in the range |y| < 0.8. The (Acc \u00d7 \u01eb) correction was determined using Monte Carlo simulations based on the GEANT3 transport code [27]. The luminous region distribution and the conditions of all the ALICE detectors in terms of active channels, gain, noise level, and alignment, and their evolution with time during the 2010 LHC run, were included in the simulations. Proton-proton collisions were simulated using the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [22] with Perugia-0 -10 - tuning [23]. Only events containing D mesons were transported through the apparatus and reconstructed, and the efficiency was extracted separately for prompt D mesons and D mesons from B meson decays. Figure 3 shows, as a function of transverse momentum, the acceptance times efficiency (Acc \u00d7 \u01eb) for D 0 , D + , and D * + mesons with |y| < y fid . At low p t , the efficiencies are of order 1% or less, while for large p t the efficiencies increase and flatten at about 10-20% for D 0 and D + , and 30% for D * + . The efficiencies without particle identification selection, shown for comparison, are the same as those with particle identification, indicating that this selection is essentially fully efficient for the signal. The efficiencies for D 0 and D + mesons from B meson decays, also shown for comparison, are larger by about a factor of two. This behaviour is due to the fact that feed-down D mesons decay further from the primary vertex, because of the large B meson lifetime (c\u03c4 \u2248 500 \u00b5m [24]). For D * + mesons, the efficiency for the prompt and feed-down components are the same in the p t range above 4 GeV/c, where no strong cuts on the separation of the D 0 decay vertex from the primary vertex are applied.",

In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty, the perturbative uncertainty on the FONLL beauty production cross section was considered, as well as an alternative way of using the FONLL calculation. The former contribution was obtained by varying the b quark mass and the factorization and renormalization scales as suggested in, e.g., [32]. The alternative method consisted of computing the prompt fraction using the FONLL cross sections for prompt and feed-down D mesons (with B \u2192 D via EvtGen [31] for the latter) and their respective Monte Carlo efficiencies:",

The full envelope of the uncertainty bands from the two methods, which is shown by the boxes in the figure, was taken as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty related to the B decay kinematics was disregarded, after verifying that the difference resulting from using the PYTHIA [22] decayer instead of EvtGen [31] is negligible with respect to the FONLL B meson cross section uncertainty. The prompt fraction of D 0 mesons in the reconstructed yield was also estimated with a data-driven method based on the measured impact parameter distribution of D 0 meson candidates in each p t interval, as done previously by the CDF Collaboration [8]. This method exploits the different shapes of the distributions of the impact parameter to the primary vertex of prompt and feed-down (displaced) D mesons. The impact parameter distribution of D 0 mesons was obtained from the one measured for candidates with invariant mass in the range |m \u2212 M D 0 | < 2 \u03c3, after subtracting the background contribution estimated from the candidates in the side-bands (in the range 4.5 \u03c3 < |m \u2212 M D 0 | < 4.5 \u03c3 + 100 MeV/c 2 ). The prompt fraction was estimated by fitting the resulting impact parameter distribution with a two-component function. The first component is a detector resolution term, modelled by a Gaussian and an exponential term, describing the impact parameter of prompt D mesons. The second component accounts for the reconstructed impact parameter distribution of D from B decay, which is modelled by a convolution of the same detector resolution term with a double-exponential function describing the true impact parameter of secondary D mesons. The fit parameters are the width of the Gaussian and the fraction of prompt D mesons, that is, the relative weight of the prompt and secondary D meson components. An example of such a fit is shown in figure 4 (right-hand panel) for the D 0 mesons in the transverse momentum interval 2 < p t < 3 GeV/c. The prompt fraction of D 0 mesons, measured with this method for 2 < p t < 12 GeV/c, is shown by the circles in figure 4 (left-hand panel) and is found to be in general agreement with the FONLL-based estimations.

A polynomial, instead of an exponential, was used for D 0 and D + mesons, while a power law convoluted with an exponential and a polynomial was considered for D * + mesons, instead of the function defined in section 3.2. A method based on bin counting (after subtraction of the background estimated from a fit in the mass side bands) was also used. The uncertainty was defined as the maximum variation in the extracted yields from these different methods. The systematic uncertainty related to the tracking efficiency includes the effects arising from track finding in the TPC, from track propagation from the TPC to the ITS, and from track quality selection. It was estimated from the comparison of data and simulation and from the variation of the track selection. The resulting uncertainty is 8% for the two-body decay of D 0 mesons and 12% for the three-body decay of D + mesons. For the D * + case, a slightly larger systematic uncertainty of 13% was assigned in the low p t region (below 3 GeV/c), because the soft pion often has p t < 150 MeV/c and is reconstructed only in the ITS. The tracking efficiency in this case has a significant uncertainty arising from the description of hadronic interactions in the simulation of the detector response.",

The distributions of these variables were compared for candidates passing loose topological cuts, i.e. essentially for background candidates, and found to be well described in the simulation. The systematic effects due to residual differences between data and simulation were quantified by repeating the analysis with different sets of cuts. In particular, the cut values were changed in order to vary the signal by at least 20% below p t = 8 GeV/c. From the corresponding variation of the corrected spectra, a systematic uncertainty of about 10% was estimated for each D meson species. As a further cross-check, the secondary vertices in the simulation were reconstructed also after a track-by-track scaling by a factor 1.08 of the impact parameter residuals with respect to their true value. This scaling is aimed at reproducing the impact parameter resolution observed in the data (see figure 1) and accounts for possible residual detector misalignment effects not fully described in the simulation. The resulting variation of the efficiency was found to decrease from 4% at p t = 1-2 GeV/c to less than 1% for p t > 5 GeV/c. This effect was not included explicitly in the uncertainty estimation, since it is to some extent accounted for in the cut variation study and its magnitude is much smaller than the 10% uncertainty assigned to the cut efficiency corrections.",
