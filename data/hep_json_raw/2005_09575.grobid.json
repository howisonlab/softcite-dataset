The existence of right-handed neutrinos, or heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), is hypothesised in many SM extensions in order to generate non-zero masses of the SM neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism [1]. For example, the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model [2] simultaneously accounts for dark matter, baryogenesis, and neutrino masses and oscillations by postulating two HNLs in the MeV-GeV mass range and a third HNL, a dark matter candidate, at the keV mass scale.",

The number of expected background events, N exp , within the \u00b11.5\u03c3 m signal window is evaluated with a second-order polynomial fit to the sideband data of the m miss spectrum, where the bin size is 0.75\u03c3 m . The uncertainty, \u03b4N exp , in the number of expected background events includes statistical and systematic components. The former comes from the statistical errors in the fit parameters, and the latter is evaluated as the difference between N exp obtained from fits using second and third order polynomials. The dominant contribution to \u03b4N exp is statistical, except near the boundaries of the HNL search region where the systematic uncertainty is comparable. Further systematic errors due to possible HNL signals in the sidebands are found to be negligible; this check is made assuming |U e4 | 2 to be equal to the expected sensitivity of the analysis. The ratio \u03b4N exp /N exp is typically 0.2-0.3%, but reaches a few percent close to the limits of the search region.An auxiliary selection with a tighter maximum positron momentum requirement of 20 GeV/c is used to achieve a locally smooth m miss spectrum of background events in the sidebands for mass hypotheses in the range 356-382 MeV/c 2 . The beam pion decay background threshold in the m 2 miss spectrum is shifted from 0.14 GeV 2 /c 4(Fig. 2)to 0.165 GeV 2 /c 4 within the auxiliary selection because the e + momentum and the m 2 miss reconstructed for the \u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd decay in the K + mass hypothesis are anticorrelated.",
