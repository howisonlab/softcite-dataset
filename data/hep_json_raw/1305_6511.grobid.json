However, non-factorizable contributions may be large [1]; the branching fraction for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c0 K * 0 decay was measured by the BaBar Collaboration to be (1.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [2] while the branching fraction for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c1 K * 0 decay was measured by the BaBar and Belle Collaborations to be (2.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [3] and (1.73 +0.15+0.34 \u22120.12\u22120.22 ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [4], respectively. The branching fraction for the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K * 0 has been measured by the BaBar Collaboration to be (6.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [3] and, unlike the branching fraction for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c0 K * 0 decay, can still be explained in the factorization approach [5]. Therefore, future measurements of the branching fractions of both B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c1 K * 0 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K * 0 decays can provide valuable information for the understanding of the production of \u03c7 c states in B meson decays, where \u03c7 c denotes \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 states.

The combined tracking system has momentum resolution p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [7]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.
