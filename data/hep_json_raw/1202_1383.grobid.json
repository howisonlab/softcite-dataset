A suppression of the inclusive J=c yield in Pb-Pb is observed with respect to the one measured in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. The nuclear modification factor, integrated over the 0%-80% most central collisions, is 0:545 AE 0:032\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:083\u00f0syst\u00de and does not exhibit a significant dependence on the collision centrality. These features appear significantly different from measurements at lower collision energies. Models including J=c production from charm quarks in a deconfined partonic phase can describe our data.",

            "text": "Ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy nuclei aim at producing nuclear matter at high temperature and pressure. Under such conditions quantum chromodynamics predicts the existence of a deconfined state of partonic matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Among the possible probes of the QGP, heavy quarks are of particular interest since they are expected to be produced in the primary partonic scatterings and to coexist with the surrounding medium. Therefore, the measurement of quarkonium states and hadrons with open heavy flavor is expected to provide essential information on the properties of the stronglyinteracting system formed in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions [1]. In particular, according to the color-screening model [2], measuring the in-medium dissociation probability of the different quarkonium states is expected to provide an estimate of the initial temperature of the system. In the past two decades, J=c production in heavy-ion collisions was intensively studied at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), from approximately 20 to 200 GeV center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair ( ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi s NN p ). At the SPS, a strong J=c suppression was found in the most central Pb-Pb collisions [3]. The observed suppression is larger than the one expected from Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, which include nuclear absorption and (anti-) shadowing. The dissociation of excited c \" c states like c and c \u00f02S\u00de, which in pp collisions constitute about 40% of the inclusive J=c yield [1], is one possible interpretation of the observed suppression. A J=c suppression was also observed at RHIC, in central Au-Au collisions [4,5], at a level similar to the one observed at the SPS when measured at midrapidity although it is larger at forward rapidity. Several models [6][7][8][9] attempt to reproduce the RHIC data by adding to the direct J=c production a regeneration component from deconfined charm quarks in the medium, which counteracts the J=c dissociation in a QGP. A quantitative description of these final-state effects is however difficult at the present time because of the lack of precision in the CNM effects and in the open charm cross section determination. The measurement of charmonium production is especially promising at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where the high energy density of the medium and the large number of c \" c pairs produced in central Pb-Pb collisions should help to disentangle between the different suppression and regeneration scenarios. At the LHC, a suppression of inclusive J=c with high transverse momentum was observed in central Pb-Pb collisions at ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi s NN p \u00bc 2:76 TeV with respect to peripheral collisions or pp collisions at the same energy by ATLAS [10] and CMS [11], respectively.",

            "text": "The spectrometer consists of a ten interaction length thick absorber filtering the muons in front of five tracking stations comprising two planes of cathode pad chambers each, with the third station inside a dipole magnet with a 3 Tm field integral. The tracking apparatus is completed by a triggering system made of four planes of resistive plate chambers downstream of a 1.2 m thick iron wall, which absorbs secondary hadrons escaping from the front absorber and low momentum muons coming mainly from and K decays. In addition, the silicon pixel detector (SPD) and scintillator arrays (VZERO) were used in this analysis. The VZERO counters, two arrays of 32 scintillator tiles each, cover 2:8 5:1 (VZERO-A) and \u00c03:7 \u00c01:7 (VZERO-C). The SPD consists of two cylindrical layers covering jj 2:0 and jj 1:4 for the inner and outer layers, respectively. All these detectors have full azimuthal coverage. The minimum bias (MB) trigger requirement used for this analysis consists of a logical AND of the three following conditions: (i) a signal in two readout chips in the outer layer of the SPD, (ii) a signal in VZERO-A, (iii) a signal in VZERO-C, providing a high triggering efficiency for hadronic interactions. The beam induced background was further reduced by timing cuts on the signals from the VZERO and from the zero degree calorimeters (ZDC). The contribution from electromagnetic processes was removed with a cut on the energy deposited in the neutron ZDCs. The centrality determination is based on a fit of the VZERO amplitude distribution as described in [15]. A cut corresponding to the most central 80% of the nuclear cross section was applied; for these events the MB trigger is fully efficient. A data sample of 17:7 \u00c2 10 6 Pb-Pb collisions collected in 2010 satisfying all the above conditions is used in the following analysis. It corresponds to an integrated luminosity L int % 2:9 b \u00c01 .

            "text": "J=c candidates are formed by combining pairs of opposite-sign (OS) tracks reconstructed in the geometrical acceptance of the muon spectrometer. To reduce the combinatorial background, the reconstructed tracks in the muon tracking chambers are required to match a track segment in the muon trigger system. The resulting invariant mass distribution of OS muon pairs for the 0%-80% most central Pb-Pb collisions is shown in Fig. 1, where a J=c signal above the combinatorial background is clearly visible. The J=c raw yield was extracted by using two different methods. The OS dimuon invariant mass distribution was fitted with a Crystal Ball (CB) function to reproduce the J=c line shape, and a sum of two exponentials to describe the underlying continuum. The CB function connects a Gaussian core with a power-law tail [16] at low mass to account for energy loss fluctuations and radiative decays. At high transverse momenta (p t ! 3 GeV=c), the sum of two exponentials does not describe correctly the underlying continuum; it was replaced by a third order polynomial. Alternatively, the combinatorial background was subtracted using an event-mixing technique. The resulting mass distribution was fitted with a CB function and an exponential or a first order polynomial to describe the remaining background. The event-mixing was preferred to the like-sign subtraction technique since it is less sensitive to correlated signal pairs present in the like-sign spectra and gives better statistical precision. The c \u00f02S\u00de was not included in the signal line shape since its contribution is negligible. The width of the J=c mass peak depends on the resolution of the spectrometer which can be affected by the detector occupancy that increases with centrality. This effect, evaluated by embedding simulated J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 decays into real events, was found to be less than 2%. This conclusion was confirmed by a direct measurement of the tracking chamber resolution versus centrality using reconstructed tracks. Therefore, the same CB line shape can be used for all centrality classes. The parameters of the CB tails were fixed to the values obtained either in simulations or in pp collisions where the signal to background ratio is much higher. For each of these choices, the mean and width of the CB Gaussian part were fixed to the value obtained by fitting the mass distribution in the centrality range 0%-80%. In addition, a variation of the width of AE1 standard deviation was applied to account for uncertainties (varying the mean has turned out to have a negligible effect in comparison). The raw J=c yield in each centrality class was determined as the average of the results obtained with the two fitting approaches and the various CB parametrizations, while the corresponding systematic uncertainties were defined as the RMS of these results. It was also checked that every individual result differs from the mean value by less than three RMS. The raw J=c yield in our Pb-Pb sample is 2350 AE 139\u00f0stat\u00de AE 189\u00f0syst\u00de. The invariant mass resolution is around 78 MeV=c 2 , in very good agreement with the embedded J=c simulations. The signal to background ratio integrated over AE3 of the mass resolution varies from 0.1 for central collisions to 1.5 for peripheral collisions. The measured number of J=c (N i J=c ) was normalized to the number of events in the corresponding centrality class (N i events ) and further corrected for the branching ratio (BR) of the dimuon decay channel, the acceptance A and the efficiency i of the detector. The inclusive J=c yield in each centrality class i for our measured p t and y ranges (\u00c1p t , \u00c1y) is then given by:",

The J=c reference cross sections in pp collisions [24] and the R AA total systematic uncertainties, indicated as open boxes in the figure, were evaluated in the same kinematic range. Our results are shown together with a measurement from CMS [11] of the inclusive J=c R AA in the rapidity range 1:6 < jyj < 2:4 with p t ! 3 GeV=c. No significant rapidity dependence can be seen in the J=c R AA for p t ! 0. For p t ! 3 GeV=c, a decrease of R AA is observed with increasing rapidity reaching a value of 0:289 AE 0:061\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:078\u00f0syst\u00de for 3:25 < y < 4. At LHC energies, J=c nuclear absorption is likely to be negligible and the modification of the gluon distribution function is dominated by shadowing effects [25]. An estimate of shadowing effects is shown in Fig. 3 within the color singlet model at leading order [26] and the color evaporation model at next to leading order [27]. The shadowing is, respectively, calculated with the nDSg and the EPS09 parametrizations [27] of the nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF). For nDSg (EPS09) the upper and lower limits correspond to the uncertainty in the factorization scale (uncertainty of the nPDF). The effect of shadowing shows no dependence with rapidity and its overall amount is reduced by the addition of a transverse momentum cut. At most, shadowing effects are expected to lower the R AA from 1 to 0.7. Recent color glass condensate (CGC) calculations for LHC energies may indicate a larger initial state suppression (R AA % 0:5) [28]. However, any J=c suppression due to initial state effects, CGC or shadowing, will be stronger at lower p t contrary to the data behavior.",

The prediction is given for two values of d c \" c =dy in absence of a measurement for Pb-Pb collisions. The two transport model results [30,31] presented in the same figure differ mostly in the rate equation controlling the J=c dissociation and regeneration.
