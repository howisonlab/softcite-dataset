            "text": "The masses of particles in the Standard Model (SM) are generated by the coupling of the Higgs field to the left-and right-handed components of a given particle. There being no right-handed neutrino components in the SM, neutrinos in the SM are strictly massless. However, experimental data on neutrino oscillations show that neutrinos are not massless, though their masses are very small [1]. Therefore, a mechanism beyond the SM is needed to establish neutrino masses. One possibility is the addition of right-handed neutrinos, which may also have a Majorana mass, naturally explaining the smallness of the observed neutrino masses via the so-called \"see-saw\" mechanism [2]. For example, the neutrino minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) [3] introduces three righthanded singlet heavy neutrinos, so that every left-handed particle has a right-handed counterpart. This model explains neutrino oscillations, the existence of dark matter and baryogenesis with the same set of parameters. Heavy neutrinos also appear in other extensions to the SM, such as SUSY [4], grand unification theories [5] or models with exotic Higgs representations [6].",

The Belle detector is a largesolid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-offlight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [9].

All other tracks in the event are treated as pion candidates. Additional selection criteria for the lepton and pion tracks are described below. A significant background remains for heavy neutrino candidates from particles with similar event topology, notably K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . These backgrounds are suppressed by strict lepton identification requirements. Electrons are identified using the energy and shower profile in the ECL, the light yield in the ACC and the specific ionization energy loss in the CDC (dE/dx). This information is used to form an electron (L e ) and non-electron (L\u0113) likelihood; these are combined into a likelihood ratio R e = L e /(L e + L\u0113) [12]. Applying a requirement on R e , electrons are selected with an efficiency and a misidentification rate of approximately 90% and 0.1%, respectively, in the kinematic region of interest. Muons are distinguished from other charged tracks by their range and hit profiles in the KLM. This information is utilized in a likelihood ratio approach [13] similar to the one used for the electron identification. Muons are selected with an efficiency and a misidentification rate of approximately 90% and 1%, respectively, in the kinematic region of interest.
