            "text": "J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c decay is a magnetic dipole radiative transition in charmonium with the most probable photon energy \u03c9 0 of about 114 MeV and a fairly large branching fraction of (1.7 \u00b1 0.4)% [1]. This is a transition between 1S states of the charmonium system and its rate can be easily calculated in potential models. In the nonrelativistic approximation, the magnetic dipole amplitudes between S -wave states are independent of a specific potential model, because the spatial overlap equals one for states within the same multiplet. A simple calculation in the nonrelativistic approximation yields the result [2] B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) = 3.05%. It is reasonable to assume that relativistic corrections are of order 20 \u00f7 30%, similarly to the case of the electric dipole transitions in the charmonium (see, for example, the reviews [3,4]). However, in 1986 the Crystal Ball Collaboration measured this branching fraction in the inclusive photon spectrum and obtained a much smaller value (1.27 \u00b1 0.36)% [5]. There are a lot of theoretical predictions for this decay rate [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13], based on QCD sum rules, lattice QCD calculations and so on, but as a rule they lead to values approximately twice as large as the Crystal Ball result. This discrepancy remained unchanged for more than twenty years. During this period no new measurements of this branching fraction were performed, and the PDG average [14] was based on the single Crystal Ball result. Only in 2009 the CLEO Collaboration published the result of a new measurement [15], in which 12 exclusive decay modes of the \u03b7 c were analyzed. The obtained value B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) = (1.98 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.30)% is closer to theoretical predictions. Combining the Crystal Ball and CLEO results, PDG obtained B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) = (1.7 \u00b1 0.4)% [1] with a scale factor of 1.6. In this work we report the result of a new independent measurement performed using the inclusive photon spectrum.",

This requires either a knowledge of the photon lineshape or a background measurement with sufficient accuracy.

Therefore, to determine the number of signal events, during the data fitting one has to specify the explicit form of the resonance.

The first term in the expression (6) well describes background in the photon energy range of 50 \u00f7 450 MeV. These photons arise mainly from \u03c0 0 decays, other processes give a small contribution. At lower photon energies background is not described by such a simple form because of the additional significant contribution from neutral clusters appearing due to nuclear interactions of hadrons in the calorimeter. Due to inefficiencies of track reconstruction and TOF counters, a small part of charged particles is misidentified as neutrals, so the scaled histogram of charged particles was added to the background function during the fit of the photon spectrum. In the fit, parameters of the polynomial and c coefficient were varied freely. The number of signal photons determined from the fit is equal to N sig = (45.4 \u00b12.9) \u00d710 3 , while the number of the multihadron events selected is N sel mh = 4.70 \u00d7 10 6 .

The mass and width values are determined from the spectrum shape in the region of the resonance peak, thus for them the model uncertainty related to lineshape is small. At the same time this uncertainty for the branching fraction is mainly determined by the tail of the spectrum and is much larger. The fit of the spectrum using the lineshape (2) with f (\u03c9) \u2261 1 gives B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c ) = (10.3 \u00b1 0.6)%, i.e. the decay rate can, in principle, be determined just by the tail.

An additional correction was made assuming that only a fraction of the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3gg decay amplitude with the same quantum numbers of the ggsystem and \u03b7 c interferes. The probability for the gg-system to have J P = 0 \u2212 in this decay was calculated in the lowest order in [28] and equals 0.3 for small \u03c9. With these corrections we estimate the N(\u03c9 0 ) value as (4.6 \u00b1 2.2)% of S (\u03c9 0 ).

The systematic errors for the \u03b7 c mass, width and \u0393 0 \u03b3\u03b7 c , appearing due to a poorly known photon lineshape were estimated by changing the low energy cut-off parameter 2\u0393 \u03b7 c to 1.5\u0393 \u03b7 c , and taking f (\u03c9) \u2261 1. The calibration of the photon energy scale was performed using \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3 decays. Within 1.5% it agrees with the calibrations made with a data sample collected at the \u03c8(2S ) peak, using \u03c8(2S ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 , \u03c8(2S ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c2 transitions.
