Its high sensitivity to the self-interaction between gauge bosons is a direct consequence of the non-abelian S U(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge symmetry of the SM and is fully fixed in the SM by the gauge structure of the Lagrangian. Any deviation of the SM couplings is an indication of new physics, manifested as an increased production cross section for instance. The measurement of triple gauge boson couplings (TGC) is also an important test of the SM as a useful step to establish major backgrounds to the electroweak searches. Moreover, a number of extensions of the SM can manifest themselves in processes with multiple bosons in the final state and a measurement of TGCs can be sensitive to new phenomena at high energies, that would require more energy or luminosity to be directly observed. Within the SM, using the effective Lagrangian approach,",

The main backgrounds are due to jets misidentified as photons and are estimated with data driven techniques.

For this purpose a particular variable is used, namely the missing transverse energy is projected along the direction of the closest lepton and its orthogonal component is used as discriminating variable in case the angle \u2206\u03c6(MET, lepton) is smaller than \u03c0/2. This \"projected-MET \" is particularly suitable to reject eventual Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decays, in case of boosted Z. It is required above 40 GeV for the same flavor W decays (ee, \u00b5\u00b5) and above 20 GeV for the e\u00b5 channels. Some further cuts are required to reduce the contamination from background processes with jets, heavy hadrons and mis-reconstructed diboson channels. Events are rejected if containing jets with p T >30 GeV/c, a further veto is applied on \"top-tagged\" jets accounting also for soft muons from b-quark decays. To further reduce the Drell-Yan background, events with a dilepton e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass within 15 GeV/c 2 of the Z are vetoed. Finally the angle in the transverse plane between the dilepton system and the most energetic jet with p T >15 GeV/c is required to be smaller than 165 degrees, in the ee/\u00b5\u00b5 final states, to cope with Z events where the boson recoils against a jet. The main backgrounds are estimated directly from data. The fake rate measured on jets enriched data samples allows to estimate W+jets and QCD multi-jet events. The remaining top background is estimated from data as well by using \"top-tagged\" events and applying the corresponding tagging efficiency, which is measured in a data control sample. The residual Z boson contribution to the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final states are estimated by normalizing the simulation to the observed number of events inside the Z mass window in data.",

A p T >7(5) GeV/c is required for electrons (muons). Different criteria are used to select taus, namely p T >10 GeV/c for leptonic tau decays, p T >20 GeV/c for hadronic taus decays. Moreover, in presence of taus, it's the visible mass of the Z boson to be required in the range [30, 80] GeV/c 2 . Leptons are required to be isolated, the isolation being measured based on the combination of tracker, ECAL and HCAL measurements. Finally, a cut is applied on the lepton impact parameter for selected leptons. Leptons from misidentified jets or heavy hadrons decay are a main source of remaining backgrounds. Concerning final states with taus, also WZ can be a relevant background and it is estimated from simulations. Zbb in particular and tt are estimated from data, by means of a control region defined by reverting the cut on the leptons impact parameter. Z+ jets is controlled by measuring the rate of jets faking electrons, muons and taus respectively.

We thus rely on other methods, based on experimental data, for the control of the background and the evaluation of the associated systematics. The typical procedure consists of choosing a wide background control region outside the signal phase space which gets populated by relaxing some cuts in the event selection, and verifying that the event rates change according to the expectation from Monte Carlo. The control region for any given background must be chosen carefully since any or both of the other two reducible backgrounds might rapidly become dominant if the event selection is relaxed, thus making the extrapolation to the signal phase space difficult.",

The presented selection reduces the full signal phase space to order 60% for the e, \u00b5 and to \u223c20% for tau channels respectively. Main sources of uncertainties are from the background control through data driven techniques and the selection of the leptons. As an example, a 3% systematic error is assigned to the e, \u00b5 reconstruction, while a 6% to taus. To include all final states in the cross section calculation a simultaneous constrained fit on the number of observed events in all decay channels was performed, taking into account the systematic uncertainties found, by means of a profile likelihood. The resulting ZZ production cross section for a pair of Z bosons in the mass range [60, 120] GeV/c 2 is measured to be \u03c3(pp \u2192 ZZ + X) = 3. ",

This procedure allows to quantify eventual anomalous coupling parameters, which would bring to an enhancement of the diboson production cross section, in particular at high boson transverse momentum, if introduced in the SM Lagrangian.
