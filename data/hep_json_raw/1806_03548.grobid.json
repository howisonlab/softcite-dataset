            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3], with mass of 125 GeV [4,5] and properties consistent with the standard model (SM) of particle physics at the CERN LHC, motivates searches for resonances via their decays into Higgs bosons. Several theories for physics beyond the SM posit narrow-width resonances decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons (HH). For instance, models with a warped extra dimension [6] predict the existence of new particles such as the spin-0 radion [7][8][9] and the spin-2 first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the graviton [10][11][12], which could decay to HH. These models have an extra warped spatial dimension compactified between two branes, with an exponential metric \u03bal, \u03ba being the curvature and l the coordinate of the extra spatial dimension [13]. The benchmark of the model is the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory, \u039b \u2261 \u221a 8\u03c0e \u2212\u03bal M Pl , M Pl being the Planck scale. In proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC, the graviton and the radion are produced primarily through gluon-gluon fusion and are predicted to decay to HH with branching fractions of approximately 10 and 23%, respectively [14].",

The main challenge of this search is to discriminate the final-state signature of four bottom quark jets from the overwhelming multijet quantum chromodynamics (QCD) background. This is addressed by dedicated online selection criteria that include b jet identification and by a model of the multijet background that is tested in control regions of data. The analysis closely follows the approach adopted for the 8 TeV data [15] but the sensitivity for high resonance mass values is enhanced because of the significant increase in production cross section at 13 TeV, a new trigger strategy and a more efficient algorithm for identifying jets originating from bottom quarks.",

A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, reside within the solenoid. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) [23] coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [23] Simulated samples of signal events are produced using various Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, with the CMS detector response modeled using the Geant4 [24] program. To model the production of a generic narrow-width spin-0 resonance, we use an MC simulation of the bulk radion produced through gluon fusion. The momenta and angular distributions for decay products of a spin-2 resonance are distinct from those for a spin-0 resonance, and result in different kinematic distributions. Therefore, we evaluate the signal efficiencies for a narrow-width spin-2 resonance from a separate simulation of the first excitation of a bulk KK graviton produced through gluon fusion and forced to decay to a pair of Higgs bosons with the parameters reported in ref. [25]. Bulk graviton and radion signal events are simulated with masses in the range 260-1200 GeV and widths of 1 MeV (narrow-width approximation), using the MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.3.3 [26] event generator at leading order (LO). The resonance is forced to decay into a pair of Higgs bosons which in turn decay into bb. The parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 [27] with LO accuracy is used. The showering and hadronization of partons are simulated with pythia 8.212 [28].",

The centers of these circular regions have been determined separately for the LMR and MMR and found to be 120 and 125 GeV, respectively. If there are multiple HH candidates in an event, the combination that minimizes R 2 is used. After these event selection criteria are applied, the dijet invariant mass resolution for m H 1 and m H 2 is approximately 10-13%, depending on the p T of the reconstructed Higgs boson, with a few percent shift in the value of the mass peak, relative to 125 GeV. The Higgs boson mass resolution is further improved by applying multivariate regression techniques similar to those used in the searches for SM Higgs bosons decaying to bb in CMS [39,40]. The regression estimates a correction that is applied after the standard CMS jet energy corrections [34,41], and it is computed for individual b jets to improve the accuracy of the measured energy with respect to the b quark energy. To this end, a specialized boosted decision tree [42] is trained on simulated b jets from tt events, with inputs that include observables related to the jet structure and b tagging information. The average improvement in the Higgs boson mass resolution, measured with simulated signal samples, is 6-12%, depending on the p T of the reconstructed Higgs boson. The use of the regression technique increases the sensitivity of the analysis by 5-20% depending on the mass hypothesis. The regression technique is validated with data samples of Z \u2192 (ee, \u00b5\u00b5) events with two b tagged jets and in tt-enriched samples [39].

These control regions are: figure 3), and (ii) events in the SR and both SB regions that do not qualify as signal events due to a requirement that one of the four jets used to reconstruct m X is not identified as a b jet (anti-tag selection). For the LMR selection, the m X distributions in all control regions exhibit a kinematic turn-on, due to the trigger requirements, followed by a smoothly falling distribution at the larger m X values. The m X distributions in all control regions for the MMR selection exhibit a similar smoothly falling shape with increasing m X . This feature allows the adoption of a common form of the parametric background model in the SR and control regions. The parameters of the background model are determined by the fit used to extract a possible signal. In the following we describe the derivation of the background model from the different control regions. For the LMR, it is difficult to model simultaneously the turn-on and the tail of the m X distribution. Thus, the modeling of the background is split into two ranges, LMR1 and LMR2, with two different parametric models to accommodate either a turn-on shape or a falling distribution, respectively.",

The method uses two selections in the SR and SB, as described in table 1. For the background, the shape of the m X distribution in the SR (A) is predicted from the shape of the m X distribution in the SR using the anti-tag selection (C) but reshaped by the ratio, as a function of m X , between the m X distribution in the SB with the nominal selection (B) and the m X distribution in the SB with the anti-tag selection (D), so that A = CB/D. To test the validity of this method, new SR and SB regions, centered at 150 GeV, are defined along the diagonal in figure 3 in a similar fashion to those centered at 120 GeV. In that case the prediction E = GF/H for the m X distribution in the SR region centered at 150 GeV can be tested by directly comparing to the m X distribution in that region. Figure 4 shows the agreement between this prediction and the observed distribution, validating the use of this method for the SR distribution centered at 120 GeV. The boundary between LMR1 and LMR2 is then set at m X = 310 GeV, by optimizing for the expected sensitivity.",

The lower panel shows the difference between the data and the fits, divided by the uncertainty in the number of data events. normalization caused by the choice of the PDF set [46] contributes up to 3.5%. The jet energy scale [34,41] is varied within one standard deviation as a function of jet p T and \u03b7, and the efficiency of the selection criteria recomputed. The signal efficiencies are found to vary by up to 2.9%. The effect of the uncertainty in the jet energy resolution [34,41] is evaluated by smearing the jet energies according to the measured uncertainty. This causes variations in the signal efficiency of between 0.9 and 2.1%. The trigger efficiency is evaluated in a tt-enriched control sample in which an isolated muon is required in addition to the four b tagged jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 demanded in the analysis. The efficiency of each online kinematic and b tagging requirement is evaluated separately and then the efficiency of all the trigger selection criteria is computed in terms of conditional probability. The associated systematic uncertainties are found to impact signal efficiencies at the level of 5-9%. Signal yields are corrected to match the b tagging efficiency measured in data [35]. The associated uncertainty is evaluated to be about 6-8%.",

The parameters and normalization of the multijet background shape are left to float freely in the fit. The shapes of the background-only fit are found to adequately describe the data in each of the search region. The observed and expected upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction for pp \u2192 X \u2192 H(bb)H(bb) at 95% confidence level (CL) are computed using the modified frequentist CL s method [47][48][49][50].

The green and yellow bands represent the \u00b11 and \u00b12 standard deviation confidence intervals around the expected limits. The observed limits in these figures exhibit several deviations from the expected one beyond \u00b12 standard deviation. The local p-value of the most significant excess (deficit) is 2.6 (\u22123.6) standard deviation. In order to estimate the global significance of these deviations within the search range, we estimated, based on pseudo-experiments, a global probability to see three (four) positive or negative deviations from the expected limits consistent with narrow positive or negative signal contributions with the square sum of the significances exceeding 5.1 (5.6) standard deviation, as observed in data. In both cases, the global probability was found to be in a percent range, consistent with a statistical nature of the observed deviations.

            "text": "A search for a narrow-width resonance decaying into two Higgs bosons, each decaying into a bottom quark-antiquark pair, is presented. The search is performed using protonproton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence for a signal is observed and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section for spin-0 and spin-2 resonances in the mass range from 260 to 1200 GeV are set. These cross-section limits are translated into an exclusion at 95% confidence level of a bulk KK-graviton (with \u03bal = 35 and \u03ba = 0.5M Pl ) in the mass ranges of 320-450 GeV and 480-720 GeV. The corresponding excluded mass ranges for a radion (with decay constant \u039b = 3 TeV) are 260-280 GeV, 300-450 GeV and 480-1120 GeV. This analysis outperforms a similar search by CMS using 17.9 fb \u22121 collected at 8 TeV [15] and extends the sensitivity to the gluon fusion production of a radion with decay constant \u039b = 3 TeV and to bulk graviton with \u03ba set to 0.5M Pl .",
