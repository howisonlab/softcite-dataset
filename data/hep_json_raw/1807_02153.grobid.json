The four efficiency corrected yields have a standard deviation of 115, which is 3.0% of the average efficiency corrected yield of 3816. The efficiency corrected yields are larger in the subtraction method and this method has a conceptual problem. Our subtraction choice is a best guess; there is no clear way to determine how many K 0 S actually contaminate the signal rather than coming from the background.",
