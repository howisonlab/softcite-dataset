            "text": "In the quark-parton model the transverse degrees of freedom of the nucleon constituents are usually integrated over, and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) as determined in leptonnucleon deep inelastic scattering (DIS) depend only on the Bjorken scaling variable x and on Q 2 , the virtuality of the exchanged photon. On the other hand it was soon realised [1,2] that in semiinclusive DIS processes, namely in lepton-nucleon DIS in which at least one hadron from the current jet is detected, a possible intrinsic transverse momentum of the target quark would cause measurable effects in the cross-section. Indeed the semi-inclusive DIS cross-section is expected to exhibit a cos \u03c6 h and a cos 2\u03c6 h modulation, where \u03c6 h is the angle between the lepton scattering plane and the plane defined by the hadron and the virtual photon directions, as shown in Fig. 1. The coefficients of these modulations are predicted to vanish asymptotically as 1/Q and 1/Q 2 , respectively [2]. The early measurements in the 70s however were not accurate enough to detect such modulations.",

            "text": "At the end of the 70s, interest in possible modulations of the semi-inclusive DIS cross-section came also from a different direction. Azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarised processes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are generated by gluon radiation and splitting, and the observation of these asymmetries was in fact proposed as a test of perturbative QCD (pQCD) [3]. Such a possibility however was immediately questioned by R. Cahn [4]. Using simple kinematics the amplitudes of the azimuthal modulations expected from the quark intrinsic transverse momentum could be computed and shown to be the dominant term as long as both Q 2 and the hadron transverse momentum are not too large [4]. Azimuthal modulations in the semi-inclusive DIS cross-section were indeed first observed by the EMC Collaboration [5,6] and then at FNAL [7], and at higher energies by the ZEUS experiment at HERA [8]. The present understanding is that pQCD accounts for the asymmetries at large values of the final-state hadron transverse momentum p h T , while at low values (p h T 1 GeV/c) it is the intrinsic transverse motion of the quarks which plays the key role [9].",

            "text": "Intrinsic transverse momentum has recently attracted much attention in connection with the great experimental and theoretical effort to understand the origin of the nucleon spin and, in particular, the many transverse spin effects in hadronic reactions observed since several decades. The PDFs of the nucleon have been generalised to include this new degree of freedom, introducing the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) distributions. Also, TMD fragmentation functions (FF) have been introduced, the best known being the Collins FF, which describes a correlation between the transverse momentum p h T of each of the hadrons in a hadronic jet and the spin of the fragmenting quark in the hadronisation process of a transversely polarised quark. The knowledge of this new sector of hadronic physics is still at its beginning, but several new important phenomena have been assessed [10] within a solid theoretical QCD framework [11]. Within this framework, much attention has been payed to distributions which are T -odd and for a long time were believed to be zero to preserve T -invariance. It was demonstrated afterwards that either initial or final state interactions can result in non-zero T -odd distributions. One T -odd PDF, the Sivers function, has already been shown to be definitely different from zero in semi-inclusive DIS processes off transversely polarised protons, even at high energies [12,13]. Another T -odd TMD PDF is the so-called Boer-Mulders function, which describes the correlation between the quark transverse spin and its transverse momentum in an unpolarised nucleon [14]. On top of the Cahn effect, the Boer-Mulders TMD PDF convoluted with the Collins FF is expected to contribute to the amplitudes of the cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03c6 h modulations in unpolarised semi-inclusive DIS processes and its extraction from the cross-section data is an important goal of the more recent investigations at lower energies by the HERMES Collaboration [15] and by the CLAS Collaboration [16].",

The 6 LiD grains were immersed in a mixture of liquid 3 He/ 4 He. A small contamination of 7 Li almost exactly balances the proton excess in 3 He, so that the target can effectively be regarded to be isoscalar. The data used in the present analysis (25% of the full 2004 data sample) have been taken with the target transversely polarised, i.e. polarised along the direction of the dipole field (0.42 T) provided by two additional saddle coils. The two target cells were oppositely polarised, so data were taken simultaneously for the two target polarisation states. In order to keep systematic effects under control, the orientation of the polarisation was reversed every 4 to 5 days (referred to as a \"period\" of data taking in the following).",

Nevertheless, the effect has been evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations using a dedicated software (RADGEN [27]) in combination with LEPTO.

The comparison with most of the existing data is difficult because of the different kinematic ranges. Moreover, the asymmetries have been measured as functions of different variables and without charge separation. This is not the case for the recently published results by the HERMES experiment [15], which give the asymmetries as a function of x, y, z and p h T both for proton and deuteron targets and for charged and identified hadrons.

In particular, the HERMES results also show larger (and negative) asymmetries for positive hadrons in the overlapping x region. Because of the different x range, the HERMES mean values are smaller but the data show z and p h T dependencies similar to that shown in Fig. 10.

They both are positive and larger for negative hadrons, over all the measured range. Again there is a strong dependence on the kinematic variables. In this case the asymmetry decreases with x and it increases as functions of z and p h T , but only up to z 0.6 and p h T 0.4 GeV/c. Strong dependencies on the kinematic variables are also present in the HER-MES results [15]. First attempts to describe the observed behaviour in terms of the Cahn effect that is expected to dominate at small x and the Boer-Mulders effect [32] could not reproduce the data well, and in particular the p h T dependence (the preliminary results were even not included in the fit) which was expected to be almost linear.",

Also, as can be seen in the figure, the absolute values of the asymmetries for z < 0.55 increase   with p h T , and the large and negative values at large z in the 1d projection are mainly due to the values at small x and p h T . Summarising, the data suggest that there are different regimes and different dominant processes in the various regions of the (x, z, p h T ) space and that a deeper phenomenological investigation is required.",

Results have been produced binning the data in x, z or p h T , integrating over the other two variables, and in a three-dimensional grid of the three variables x, z and p h T . The amplitude of the sin \u03c6 h modulation is positive and small with respect to the statistical uncertainties. The amplitude of the cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03c6 h modulations clearly show non-zero values and their dependencies over kinematical variables turns out to be very strong and not easy to be described in the present phenomenological framework. The new data can be used in multidimensional global analyses and constitute an important information for the understanding of the transverse momentum structure of the nucleon. ",
