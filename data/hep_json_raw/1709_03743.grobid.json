Potassium-40 ( 40 K) decays contribute roughly 1/3 of the radiogenic heat of the Earth, but it is still missing from the experimental observation. Solar neutrino experiments with liquid scintillators have observed uranium and thorium geoneutrinos and are the most promising in the low-background neutrino detection. In this article, we present the new concept of using liquid-scintillator Cherenkov detectors to detect the neutrino-electron elastic scattering process of 40 K geoneutrinos. Liquid-scintillator Cherenkov detectors using a slow liquid scintillator can achieve this goal with both energy and direction measurements for charged particles. Given the directionality, we can significantly suppress the dominant intrinsic background originating from solar neutrinos in conventional liquid-scintillator detectors. We simulated the solar-and geo-neutrino scatterings in the slow liquid scintillator detector, and implemented energy and directional reconstructions for the recoiling electrons. We found that 40 K geoneutrinos can be detected with three standard deviation accuracy in a kiloton-scale detector.",

Measuring the flux of 40 K neutrinos versus 238 U and 232 Th neutrinos can offer input to understanding the formation process of the Earth [12]. The model of 40 K and 40 Ar in the air and the Earth also indicates the enriched and depleted mantle structure [13].

We consider two schemes for the liquid-scintillator Cherenkov neutrino detector. The first approach is to use a fast, high light-yield liquid scintillator and fast photon detectors. In this case, the light yield can reach 10,000 photons per MeV with an emission time constant of a few nanoseconds, which is much longer than several picoseconds of timing precision of the photon detectors. The recent experimental development for this approach can be found in references [19][20][21]. The second approach is to use a slow liquid scintillator and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The PMTs usually have a timing precision of about one nanosecond, while the emission time constant for the slow liquid scintillator is much longer, for example, 20 nanoseconds [22][23][24].",

We define solar z-axis, z , from the Sun to the Earth, and an Earth z-axis, z \u2295 , from the center of the Earth to the detector (see Figure 2). Correspondingly, we define the angle between the recoiling electron and z as \u03b8 and the angle with z \u2295 as \u03b8 \u2295 . Geoneutrinos and solar neutrinos are generated and the kinetic energies of the recoiling electrons are recorded. With a cut on the recoiling electron kinetic energy at 0.7 MeV, the distributions of cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 \u2295 for the remaining neutrinos are shown in Figure 3. The geoneutrinos (crust and mantle) are clearly separated from the solar-neutrino background. Since the energy range of the 40 K neutrinos is distinguishable from those of the 232 Th and 238 U neutrinos, there is a chance to detect the 40 K component. Next, we will consider a real detector.   We adopted the detector scheme [26] shown in Figure 4. In the center is the slow liquid scintillator, which is contained in a transparent container, and it is surrounded by a non-scintillating material, such as water or mineral oil. The PMTs are installed with all photocathodes facing inward and forming a large spherical array. The PMTs are all immersed in the water or oil. The water behind the PMTs also serves as a veto layer, shielding the detector from radioactivities like betas, gammas, neutrons, and cosmic-ray muons. The number of signals is directly proportional to the target mass, and due to the required low-background rate, only the central region of the liquid scintillator known as the fiducial volume is accepted for signal detection.",

We take the situation of solar neutrino study at the Borexino experiment as an example [36,37] to explain our expectations. The radioactive 10 C and 11 C background are induced by cosmic-ray muons. At a deeper site, like the Jinping underground laboratory [32], these backgrounds will be suppressed by a factor of 100 or more and become negligible. External photons affect the signal extraction, for example from 208 Tl, and this can be avoided by a tighter fiducial volume cut. For the internal background, the decay products of the U and Th with secular equilibrium are not significant. One thing worth special attention is the 210 Bi background. After a few rounds of liquid scintillator purification with distillation, gas and water stripping and long term monitoring, the remaining 210 Bi seems originally from radon gas absorption on detector inner surface and is leaching out by radon's daughter nuclei 210 Pb. Good progress has been made by suppressing the thermal convection of the liquid scintillator [38,39]. Surface cleaning was also mentioned to suppress the initial radon contamination. These effects should be considered later in developing a more realistic experimental design.",

A measurement of the K element in the Earth is of interest to understand the chemical evolution of the Earth. The detection of 40 K neutrinos may lead to new knowledge of the Earth. Previously only U and Th geoneutrinos can be detected with the inverse beta process with a 1.8 MeV threshold. 40 K geoneutrinos are hard to discover for its low energy and high solar neutrino background. In this work, we found that liquid scintillator Cherenkov neutrino detectors can be used to detect the 40 K geoneutrinos. Liquid scintillator Cherenkov detectors feature both energy and direction measurements for charged particles. With the elastic scattering process of neutrinos with electrons, 40 K geoneutrinos can be detected without any intrinsic physical threshold. With the directionality, the dominant intrinsic background originated from solar neutrinos in common liquid scintillator detectors can be suppressed. With the studies of MeV electrons of Geant4 simulation, quantum and detection efficiency, and Cherenkov direction reconstruction, it is found that we can detect 40 K energy geoneutrinos with 3 standard deviations with a kilo-ton scale detector. In this study, the setting of parameters is on the optimistic side, but we found that this technology is worth further development. ",
