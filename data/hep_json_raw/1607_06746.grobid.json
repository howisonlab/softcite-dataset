Dramatic experimental progress has been made, in particular in measurements of the behaviour of particles containing the b quark, where CP violation effects are predicted by the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism that is embedded in the Standard Model. The status of these measurements and future prospects for an understanding of CP violation beyond the Standard Model are reviewed.",

The C operation conjugates all internal quantum numbers, and therefore transforms particles into antiparticles and vice versa, while under P all spatial co-ordinates are inverted. Violation of CP symmetry allows an absolute distinction between matter and antimatter to be made [1,2], and is a prerequisite for the evolution of a matter dominated universe [3].",

Remarkably, the theory has survived all such tests to date. In particular, there are a wide range of observables in the B sector, i.e. with particles involving b quarks, that are useful to test the SM predictions for CP violation. It is the purpose of this review to describe these observables, giving both the current experimental status as well as future prospects.",

In addition to the general arguments that lead to an expectation for discoveries of non-SM physics in the near future (see, for example, Ref. [10]), it is known that the SM cannot explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe [11] and therefore new sources of CP violation must exist. There is, however, no guarantee that the new CP violation will be observable in B physics, and it is important to search also in other areas. Nonetheless, since the precision of current B physics measurements is still far from the limiting theoretical uncertainties for many important observables, there is a window of possible discovery that must be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the rapidly increasing size of the available data samples provides good prospects for discoveries in the next 5-10 years.",

In order for this to be realised, the amplitudes\u0100f and A f must have at least two components with different strong and weak phases. The labelling of phases as \"strong\" or \"weak\" simply reflects their behaviour under the CP operation: \"strong\" phases (denoted by \u03b4 in the following) do not change sign under CP , while weak phases (\u03c6) do. In the SM, the strong and weak phases arise from hadronic interactions and from the CKM matrix, respectively. The separation of the amplitudes into components can be done in many ways. It is particularly useful to separate the components according to the CKM elements involved, whose relative weak phase is therefore known in the SM. Another approach, of heuristic benefit, is to distinguish \"tree\" (T ) from \"penguin\" (P ) amplitudes (example diagrams are shown in Fig. 1), so that A f = |T | e i(\u03b4 T \u2212\u03c6 T ) + |P | e i(\u03b4 P \u2212\u03c6 P ) ,\u0100f = |T | e i(\u03b4 T +\u03c6 T ) + |P | e i(\u03b4 P +\u03c6 P ) . 3The CP asymmetry is defined from the rate difference between the particle involving the quark (B) and that containing the antiquark (B),",

For any given B decay to a final state f there are only two observables (the branching fraction and A CP ) and so it is impossible to determine all four underlying parameters without additional input. Such external information could ideally be taken from first-principles calculations, and a great deal of effort has been invested in developing theoretical methods to enable such calculations (see, for example, Refs. [36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]). However, the associated uncertainties are often large. Fortunately, there are many cases where the parameters of different decay modes can be related, for example by flavour symmetries, and so data-driven methods can be used to determine the weak phase difference. In such cases, theoretically clean interpretation of CP violation effects is still possible in processes involving more than one weak phase. Processes where only a single weak phase contributes can also, in general, be interpreted with low theoretical uncertainty.",

This equation can therefore be trivially applied to two-body decays, but care is needed when discussing multibody final states. In particular, it is often useful to consider multibody final states in terms of their resonant components, e.g. in a Dalitz plot analysis of a three-body decay, or an angular analysis of a (B \u2192 V V ) decay mediated by two vector particles. In such cases, the resonant lineshapes of contributing intermediate states and the different angular distributions of contributing partial waves can guarantee the required strong phase difference even if none is present in the expressions for the intermediate amplitudes. Consequently, analysis of multibody B decays is a powerful approach to investigate CP violation.",

Considering the case that f is a CP eigenstate, S f CP probes CP violation in mixing/decay interference, while C f CP is sensitive to both CP violation in mixing and CP violation in decay -in practice since CP violation in mixing is universal and is known to be small, C f CP can in many cases be interpreted as probing the latter. If only a single weak phase appears in the decay amplitudes, then C f CP will be zero and S f CP can be cleanly interpreted in terms of that phase plus the phase of the mixing amplitude. Measurement of the hyperbolic parameter A \u2206\u0393 f CP provides additional sensitivity to the same sum of phases. In the case that f is not a CP eigenstate, the situation is slightly more complicated. None of the parameters correspond directly to CP violation, but their combinations do: if S f = \u2212Sf there is CP violation in mixing/decay interference, while if C f = \u2212Cf there is CP violation in decay. An additional probe of CP violation in decay comes from the normalisation of Eqs. (11) and (12) and their equivalents for thef final state -any difference in the normalisation factors for f andf corresponds to CP violation. Again, it is only in the case that a single weak phase contributes that CP violation measurements can be cleanly interpreted, but this situation is expected to occur for several decay modes, as discussed below.",

Signal reconstruction The efficiency to reconstruct most final state particles within the detector acceptance is broadly similar across e + e \u2212 and hadron collider experiments: if a particle traverses the detector, it will deposit sufficient energy to allow it to be reconstructed. Specific techniques can, in certain cases, be used to reconstruct particles such as neutrinos for which this is not the case. The challenge is therefore to achieve good background rejection while retaining high signal efficiency. At e + e \u2212 collider experiments operating near the \u03a5(4S) resonance this is done by exploiting the event shape, since continuum e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) events tend to be more jet-like compared to e + e \u2212 \u2192 BB events which are more spherical. At hadron collider experiments, the long lifetime of the B hadron and its large mass (which leads to large transverse momentum for its decay products) results in a distinctive decay topology which can be used to reject background. Consequently, for many B hadron decays of interest the selection efficiency is broadly comparable between e + e \u2212 and hadron collider experiments, especially for final states which involve only charged particles. The larger rate of B hadron production at hadron colliders then leads to larger yields, if the trigger efficiency is not too low, as can be seen in Table 2.",

Combinatorial background is generally suppressed through topological selection criteria and the kinematic variables used to identify signal B decays. In hadron collider experiments, the B candidate mass is almost always used, as the good momentum resolution leads to a narrow peak for signal while the combinatorial background has a slowly varying shape. In the e + e \u2212 environment, constraints from the known beam energies can be used, and it is typical to use the two almost uncorrelated variables \u2206E and m ES .

Partially reconstructed backgrounds have a lower reconstructed mass than the true mass of the decaying particle, with a distribution that is smeared depending on the missing energy. Thus good \u2206E resolution, which is ultimately dependent on good final state particle momentum resolution, is critical to reject such backgrounds in e + e \u2212 experiments. Good resolution is also essential for hadron collider experiments, but the situation is more complicated since decays of higher mass B hadrons can lead to partially reconstructed backgrounds that peak near the signal region, e.g. B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 as a background to B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + decays. In most cases such backgrounds can be separated from the signal due to their different reconstructed mass distributions. Further rejection of this type of background can be achieved, to some extent, through isolation criteria. However, in some cases the residual background level must be estimated from the (absolute or relative) production rates of the relevant B hadrons, their branching fractions to the final states of interest, and the selection efficiencies. For this reason, it is important for experiments to determine systematically the branching fractions of B hadrons into all accessible final states.",

Although B and B mesons are produced in pairs, and hence in equal numbers, at e + e \u2212 colliders, there is in principle a forward-backward asymmetry that arises due to electroweak interference effects. When coupled with an asymmetric detector, this can result in a production asymmetry, as has been seen for D/D production [75,76]. The effect is, however, suppressed by the resonant production of B mesons in e + e \u2212 collisions and is negligible for all measurements to date. Similarly, the production of B and B hadrons in pp collisions is symmetric, and therefore asymmetries are negligible. The pp collision environment, in contrast, does a priori introduce a production asymmetry, that may vary as a function of collision energy and of the kinematics of the produced B hadron. The asymmetry can be determined from the data, using control modes in which CP violation can be assumed to be negligible. Such determinations have been performed for various B hadron species [77,78]. Since the effects are below the percent level, consistent with expectations [79], they concern only the most precise measurements.",

            "text": "The dominant source of detection asymmetries is the different interaction of positively and negatively charged particles with the detector material, which causes their reconstruction efficiencies to differ. Because of their nature, detection asymmetries are difficult to simulate accurately and it is essential to measure them directly from the data for each experiment, typically using tag-and-probe techniques. A control decay which can be selected with a good signal-to-background ratio without reconstructing all final state tracks (tag) is required, and the detection asymmetry is measured from the efficiency to add the missing (probe) track. A good example of this technique is the case of D * + \u2192 D 0 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 + decays, in which the near-threshold D * + -D 0 mass difference remains a powerful signal-to-background discriminant even when one of the four D 0 decay products is not reconstructed. Similar methods can be applied for all stable charged particles. In general, the most challenging asymmetries are those of protons, both because the difference in material interaction is largest and because tag-and-probe methods rely on decays of charmed baryons, which are less plentiful and less well-known than charmed mesons. It is also possible to induce detection asymmetries through certain specific selection criteria, for example, because the calorimeter response may be different for positively or negatively charged electrons. However, plentiful control samples exist for all particle species and consequently the only challenge is to select a control sample with the same kinematic and geometric distribution as the signal. Detection asymmetries can also be minimised by reversing the polarity of the magnetic field; this is not possible for all detectors, but is the case in the LHCb and D0 experiments. Measurements of detection asymmetries are discussed for example in Refs. [80][81][82][83][84][85][86]. 3. 3. 4. Decay-time measurement and flavour tagging Several important CP violation observables can be determined from asymmetries in the decay-time distributions of B and B mesons to specific final states. These measurements require precise determination of vertex positions, in order to determine the decay time, together with \"flavour tagging\", i.e. information on whether the decaying meson was in a B or B state at the time it was tagged. Silicon vertex detectors [63,87,88] are used to determine vertex positions. In the case of experiments at e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB colliders, the decay time is determined from the difference between the positions of the vertices of the two B mesons; the known boost of the \u03a5(4S) system in the laboratory frame caused by the asymmetric beam energies results in a linear relation between the vertex separation and the decay time difference. Hence, t (with range 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u221e) is replaced with \u2206t (with range \u2212\u221e \u2264 \u2206t \u2264 \u221e) in Eqs. (11), (12), and (14). For experiments at hadron colliders, the relevant quantity is instead the distance between the B meson decay vertex and the primary collision vertex; the boost in this case is determined directly from measurement of the B momentum vector. Since selection of signal in the trigger often involves requirements on the displacement of the candidate B vertex, the efficiency can vary significantly as a function of decay time. In certain analyses, this leads to a potential source of systematic uncertainty that is not relevant for experiments at e + e \u2212 colliders.",

            "text": "Hadron collisions produce, in general, a large number of particles in addition to those from B meson decays, and therefore flavour tagging is more challenging. The methods used can be characterised as either \"opposite-side\" or \"same-side\" taggers. Opposite-side algorithms [92,93] are similar in concept to those used in e + e \u2212 colliders, and search for decay products of the other B meson produced from the primary collision. Same-sign algorithms [94,95] exploit the fact that additional particles are produced in the fragmentation processes that produces the B meson of interest. These are particularly useful for tagging B 0 s mesons, since conservation of strangeness in strong interactions implies that an associated charged kaon can effectively tag the B 0 s flavour at production. The effective tagging efficiency achieved depends on both whether a B 0 or B 0 s decay is considered and on the kinematics (particularly the p T ) of the selected decays, which may be affected for example by trigger requirements. Table 3 summarises some key properties of hadron and e + e \u2212 collider experiments relevant for measurements of CP violation in the B sector. It can be seen that the two kinds of environments complement each other: e + e \u2212 collider experiments have much more powerful flavour tagging capabilities and are better able to study final states involving multiple neutral particles or missing energy. On the other hand, hadron colliders provide access to all flavours of b hadrons and generate much larger yields for final states involving only charged particles, especially leptons. Because of this complementarity, a new generation of both hadron and e + e \u2212 collider experiments is planned. The Belle II [19,96] and upgraded LHCb [20,97] experiments aim to begin data-taking within the next five years and will improve on their predecessor's integrated luminosity by around an order of magnitude, while maintaining or improving detector resolutions and particle identification performance. In the further future, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) initiative is investigating possibilities for both e + e \u2212 [98] and hadron colliders, operating at significantly higher energies than their LEP and LHC predecessors; the potential for b physics at each of these is currently under active investigation.  Semileptonic decays of B mesons such as B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 can be considered the archetypal tree-dominated transition. In the SM there is only a single amplitude; the decay is therefore expected to be both CP -conserving and flavour-specific. \u2020 Although extensions to the SM, in particular models with charged partners of the Higgs boson, could introduce additional diagrams, these features are not expected to change. Semileptonic decays are therefore ideal to provide theoretically clean measurements of CP violation in B 0 or B 0 describes B 0 (s) -B 0 (s) mixing (and that was diagonalised in Eq. 1to obtain the physical states), and \u03c6 q 12 is their relative phase. From these expressions and the measured (or predicted) values of \u2206\u0393 (s) and \u2206m (s) , it can be seen that the SM values of both a s sl and a d sl are smaller than a permille. The experimental signature of CP violation in mixing is an asymmetry in the yield of mixed decays (e.g.",

However, since there should be no asymmetry in the unmixed yields, the effect of CP violation in mixing can also be probed from the asymmetry in the total yields. This approach is attractive for experiments at hadron colliders, where the comparatively small effective tagging efficiency would lead to an important reduction in sensitivity. The untagged asymmetry is diluted compared to the mixed asymmetry by a factor given by the inverse of the mixed fraction. Due to the large value of \u2206m s /\u0393 s , this factor is effectively 2 in the B 0 s system; for the B 0 system it is somewhat larger and depends on the decay time acceptance. Although the asymmetry is independent of the B decay time, analysis of the decay time distribution can help to separate signal from background, and to isolate the asymmetry in mixing from production or detection related effects.",

The latest results are collected in Table 4 together with the world averages and SM predictions, which are also shown in Fig. 6. Belle have measured a d sl using the inclusive dilepton approach [85]. The data analysed correspond to approximately one-tenth of the final Belle \u03a5(4S) sample, and therefore an update of this analysis would be well motivated. BaBar also have a measurement with an inclusive dilepton sample [107] and in addition have a measurement in which the signal B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 X + \u03bd decay is partially reconstructed and a charged kaon reconstructed on the opposite side of the event (K-tag) determines whether the B meson has mixed or not [84,106], allowing the determination of detection asymmetries as well as a The determination of the inclusive dimuon asymmetry A b sl by D0 [86] has attracted a great deal of attention due to the deviation, estimated to be 2.8\u03c3, from the SM prediction. Since the probabilities for B 0 and B 0 s mesons to have mixed depend on the selection criteria, D0 have performed the measurement in bins of the distances of closest approach of the muons to the primary pp interaction. This provides separation between regions where A b sl is dominated by a d sl and those where it is dominated by a s sl . There is no significant difference between the values of A b sl measured in the different regions, however the consistency of the binned data with the SM prediction gives a more significant deviation of 3.6\u03c3. It has been noted [9,110] that there is another possible contribution to A b sl , in addition to those given in Eq. (18). This contribution arises from CP violation in interference between mixing and decay and is expected to be negligible in the SM due to the small value of \u2206\u0393 d . Current constraints, both direct and indirect, on \u2206\u0393 d do not, however, exclude a significant enhancement [111,112], and therefore improved determinations are needed. A similar possible contribution due to interference between mixing and decay in B 0 s oscillations is negligible due to the small value of 2\u03b2 s . Thus, all measurements of the possible contributions to the inclusive dimuon asymmetry are currently consistent with zero, and so the inclusion of the D0 result causes some tension in the global fit.",

Since there is no reliable first principles calculation of the size of this factor, it is of great interest to study also b \u2192 ccd transitions, where the penguin/tree ratio is not CKM-suppressed. Several methods have been proposed that use flavour symmetries to relate decay modes mediated by the two sets of quark-level transitions, and thereby to constrain the possible amount of \"penguin pollution\" in the determination of \u03b2 and \u03b2 s , as discussed in Sec. 4  [116,117] has long been considered a \"golden mode\" of CP violation in the B system. The experimental challenge is to measure the coefficient of the sinusoidal oscillation of the decay-time asymmetry of Eq. 14. This motivated the design of the asymmetric e + e \u2212 B factory experiments, BaBar and Belle, in which the boost of the produced B mesons in the laboratory frame results in a separation of their decay vertices. Due to the quantum correlations of the B mesons produced in \u03a5(4S) decay, the decay of one into a final state that tags its flavour (B 0 or B 0 ) can be used to specify the flavour of the other at that instant.",

For all experiments, the results are still statistically limited. Moreover, the largest sources of systematic uncertainty differ between the e + e \u2212 and pp collision environments. Among important sources of uncertainty for BaBar and Belle are understanding of the vertexing and decay time resolution. For LHCb, however, the dominant source is due to possible tagging asymmetries.

As B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 is a pseudoscalar to vector-vector transition, it contains a mixture of CP -even and CP -odd amplitudes, due to the different possible polarisations of the final state, which must be accounted for in the fit. These terms are disentangled by performing a simultaneous fit to the decay-time and decay-angle distributions of the signal, where the relevant angles are shown in Fig. 8 in the so-called \"helicity basis\" used in the LHCb measurement [136]. A further complication arises due to interference between the \u03c6 resonance and a broad S-wave K + K \u2212 component, which must be accounted for in the fit. However, these features can be turned to the benefit of the analysis, providing better sensitivity and allowing to resolve an ambiguity in the results. For this reason, results are presented in terms of \u03c6 s rather than sin(\u03c6 s ) and cos(\u03c6 s ) or the C f , S f and A \u2206\u0393 f quantities introduced in Sec. 2. 4.

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction to Sec. 4.2, one way to investigate further the penguin transitions is to search for their effects in b \u2192 ccd transitions (for detailed discussions, see for example Refs. [113][114][115][144][145][146]). Searches for CP violation in decay, for example in B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + [68] and B + \u2192 D 0 D + decays [147], set limits at the level of a few percent, but as mentioned above there may be suppression due to small strong phase differences. A more comprehensive approach is to search for deviations from the b \u2192 ccs values of \u03b2 and \u03b2 s in B 0 and B 0 s decays to self-conjugate final states. This is particularly attractive in cases where decays can be related by the U-spin flavoursymmetry of the strong interaction, such as [149][150][151] are, in fact, in slight tension with the value of sin(2\u03b2) from b \u2192 ccs decays, as shown in Fig. 11. However, this arises partly because the central value of the Belle result [150] lies outside the physical region S 2 f + C 2 f \u2264 1, and therefore any interpretation must be made with great care. Improved measurements are needed. In the case of B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S decays, the available yield is sufficient only for a rather imprecise determination of the mixing-induced asymmetry parameters, as has recently been performed by LHCb [152]. ATLAS and CMS may be able to contribute measurements of these observables, which would be useful to reduce the overall uncertainty. Better knowledge about the penguin effects can be obtained by using a larger basis of flavour-symmetries, such as SU(3). For example, measurements of CP violation effects in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 can be used to obtain useful constraints on the penguin contribution to B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S [113,153]. Similarly, results on B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 decays provide information about possible penguin pollution in B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6. Branching fraction measurements are also an important component of the SU(3) analysis. The latest results on CP violation in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 [154,155] and J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 [156] decays are also shown in Fig. 11; these currently provide the strongest experimental limits on penguin pollution in \u03b2 and \u03b2 s . Note that B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 is a pseudoscalar to vector-vector decay, and therefore contains an admixture of CP -even and CP -odd in the final state; however results are presented in terms of \u2212\u03b7 f S f and C f to enable a useful comparison with other measurements.",

The leading effects, however, have opposite signs for the cases where the D meson is reconstructed in CP -even and -odd final states [159,160], and therefore if both are measured the theoretical uncertainty on \u03b2 s can be kept under excellent control.

As precision improves, it could therefore be of interest to explore model-independent approaches based on binning the Dalitz plot, as discussed for the determination of \u03b3 from B \u2192 DK in Sec. 4 While good experimental progress has been made on B 0 decays mediated by the b \u2192 c\u016bd transition, the same cannot be said for the B 0 s modes. The B 0 s \u2192 DK 0 S decay has recently been observed [169], but rather modest yields are available at LHCb, due to the relatively low efficiency to reconstruct the long-lived K 0 S meson. Prospects may be somewhat better for B 0 s decays mediated by the b \u2192 c\u016bs transition. The phenomenology in this case is similar to that for the b \u2192 c\u016bd case, but the interference effects between b \u2192 c\u016bs and b \u2192 ucs are larger. This leads to greater sensitivity to \u03b3, and therefore these modes will be discussed in that context in Sec. 4  Fig. 12. It is important to note that, since only tree-level amplitudes are involved, the determination of \u03b3 provides a SM benchmark measurement of CP violation, with essentially negligible theoretical uncertainty from higher-order electroweak amplitudes [173]. Small effects from mixing and CP violation in the D 0 -D 0 system can be included in the analysis, and are neglected in this discussion.",

The study of this distribution can be performed either with an amplitude model for the D decay or model-independently; either approach is referred to as the GGSZ method [197,198]. In the former case, the choice of amplitude model results in a systematic uncertainty that is hard to quantify. In the model-independent analysis the phase space (described by a Dalitz plot in the case of three-body decays) is binned, and the method requires knowledge of the average cosine and sine of the strong phase difference between amplitudes for D 0 and D 0 decays to points within each bin [197,199,200]. Such knowledge can be obtained from \u03c8(3770) \u2192 DD samples, with results available from CLEOc [201,202]. The limited precision of these measurements leads to a systematic uncertainty on \u03b3 which, however, often appears as part of the statistical error since it is experimentally convenient to constrain these hadronic parameters within uncertainties through a Gaussian penalty term in the likelihood function used in the fits. The GGSZ method gives good sensitivity to \u03b3 as it combines the strong features of the GLW and ADS approaches in channels with relatively large yields available. For",

In B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 decays, the charge of the kaon in the K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay provides a tag of the flavour of the decaying B meson [212]. Thus initial state flavour tagging, which would lead to a reduction in sensitivity, is not required. However, the finite width of the K * 0 resonance means that other contributions to the B 0 \u2192 DK + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot can enter the selection window. Consequently an additional hadronic parameter must be included in the analysis in a similar way to the coherence factor of Eq.

            "text": "\u2022 Interference between the b \u2192 c\u016bd and b \u2192 ucd transitions contributing to B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays can, in principle, be used to determine parameters sensitive to \u03b3 in a similar way as for B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decays. However, the expected small size of the interference effect (r B \u223c 0.01) makes this approach in general less statistically sensitive, and more susceptible to systematic biases. An exception arises for the ADS method, as r D and r B are still of comparable magnitude. Such analyses have been carried out with B \u2212 \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0 \u2212 decays by several experiments [185,188,[192][193][194]196]. In fact, it is becoming common for the experiments to report results with B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays also for the GLW and GGSZ methods, and to include these channels in combinations to determine \u03b3 (e.g. in Refs. [229,230]). Even if B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays have less sensitivity to \u03b3, the inclusion of these modes is valuable to obtain the best possible precision and to ensure that subleading effects are correctly handled.  [231][232][233]. If \u03b3 were well-known from other processes, results on B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 could therefore be used to obtain a determination of \u03b2 s using only tree-level decays. Since this is not the case, but instead \u03b2 s is well-known from b \u2192 ccs transitions, the results are more commonly interpreted in terms of \u03b3. Similar determinations are possible in related processesfor example CP violation in interference between mixing and decay in B 0 \u2192 D ( * )\u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 processes, which are mediated by b \u2192 c\u016bd and b \u2192 ucd transitions, probes 2\u03b2 + \u03b3. Indeed, the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 and B 0 \u2192 D \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 processes are related to U-spin, and therefore the measurements can combined in a joint analysis [233] in order to better control the hadronic parameters. This, however, results in only a small [50] improvement on the knowledge of \u03b3 which could be obtained from B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 alone. Due to the small value of \u2206\u0393 d , the only relevant observables in B 0 \u2192 D ( * )\u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decays are S f and Sf which depend on 2R D ( * ) \u03c0 sin(2\u03b2 + \u03b3 \u00b1 \u03b4 D ( * ) \u03c0 ). The ratio of magnitudes of b \u2192 ucd and b \u2192 c\u016bd amplitudes, R D ( * ) \u03c0 , has large CKM suppression and is expected to be about 0.02, making the deviation of |C f | and Cf from unity unobservably small. In addition the strong phase difference between the two amplitudes, \u03b4 D ( * ) \u03c0 must be determined from the data. Since there are only two observables that depend on three unknown quantities, it is necessary to use additional information, for example exploiting flavour symmetry relations to constrain R D\u03c0 from the measured branching fraction of",

From an experimental point of view, the key difficulty is the fact that the hyperbolic observables A \u2206\u0393 f and A \u2206\u0393 f require precise knowledge of the variation with decay time of the selection efficiency, which is reflected in the larger systematic uncertainties on those observables. This can, however, be reduced in future using the B In addition to the two-body decays discussed above, similar methods can be applied to multibody final states. In such cases additional interference effects arise due to the different resonances that contribute to the decay, potentially leading to enhanced sensitivity. For example, a decay-time-dependent analysis of the Dalitz plot distribution of B 0 \u2192 D \u2213 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 decays can be used to determine 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 [240]. Unfortunately, the available yields do not allow a useful constraint [241]. Similarly, the proposal to study CP violation in B  Such combinations have been performed by BaBar [242], Belle [243] and LHCb [229,230], each using only their own results, together with auxiliary data on the hadronic parameters in charm decays, as inputs In this case, however, the smaller value of r B makes the determination of \u03b3 more sensitive to effects due to charm mixing [244][245][246]. Biases are also possible due to CP violation in the kaon or charm systems, although these are not important effects with the current precision. Since the fractional uncertainty on r B in B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays is larger compared to the B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 case, the analysis is less statistically robust, and more dependent on the choice of framework used for the combination (such as frequentist or Bayesian). For these reasons, results from B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 decays are often excluded from the combinations, as here.",

If one of the final state mesons has a u\u016b component in its wavefunction, then tree diagrams can also contribute. For the discussion in this section, the \u03c6 and \u03b7 resonances will be considered as ss dominated; in some works this is also considered a good approximation for the f 0 (980) meson, however since the scalar sector is in general less well understood [248,249], that is not done here. In all cases it should be remembered that subleading amplitudes -which can include long-distance rescattering contributions (see, for example, Ref. [250]) -can have important effects. For the same reasons, the b \u2192 ddd transition is not considered in this section as a loop-dominated process. Decays with both tree and loop contributions are discussed in Sec. 6.",

However, it was not known if CP violation effects would be large, as it remained possible that small strong phase differences could cause suppression; a range of values were predicted in explicit models of QCD effects in these decays [38,41]. The first measurement of CP violation in B meson decays, in the B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 channel [33,34] was therefore of great importance, bearing in mind that it occurred only a few years after the first observation of direct CP violation in the kaon system [31,32].

The precision of this approach is limited by the precision achieved with the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 mode, where tagged analyses are necessary [286,331]. Significant improvement can be expected with data from Belle II. Another interesting approach is to extend these measurements to final states involving pseudoscalar and vector mesons, i.e. B \u2192 K * \u03c0 and K\u03c1. Due to the non-negligible widths of the vector particles, such measurements must be made from Dalitz plot analyses, but large yields are available in most channels. Several of the asymmetries have been measured [122,[332][333][334][335][336][337], but the precision is not yet competitive with that in the K\u03c0 modes.",

            "text": "To determine information about the CP violation associated with particular resonant amplitudes, such as those for B \u2192 K * \u03c0 and K\u03c1 decays, it is necessary to perform a model-dependent amplitude analysis of the distribution of the three-body final state over the Dalitz plot. It is also possible to search for CP violation model-independently, by comparing the binned distribution of events between B and B decays [338][339][340][341]. (Similar methods have also been proposed for untagged decays [264,265,342].) This has been done by LHCb for all of the  decays [257,343,344], revealing very large CP violation effects in some parts of the phase space as shown in Fig. 21. The CP violation is not localised around narrow resonances, but rather seems more pronounced in regions dominated by broad structures. This presents a challenge for the interpretation, since the dynamical origin of the broad structures is not clear [345,346]. Detailed Dalitz plot studies will be necessary to gain deeper insights. In addition to understanding the hadronic physics, it is of course interesting to investigate if the CP violation is consistent with the SM, for which several methods based on flavour symmetries have been proposed [347][348][349][350][351][352][353][354][355]. Similar analyses can also be performed for B 0 (s) \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 decays, where h ( ) = \u03c0, K. These provide additional interesting potential due to U-spin relations between B 0 and B 0 s decays [356], but the available yields are much smaller compared to modes with three charged tracks in the final state [289]. Ideally, such analyses should be complemented by results from the B 0 (s) \u2192 h + h \u2212 \u03c0 0 and B + \u2192 K 0 S h + \u03c0 0 modes, but the reconstruction of neutral particles is challenging at a hadron collider and LHCb has not yet produced any results on these modes. Belle II, however, is expected to be able to study at least some of these channels.",

Alternatively, if the value of \u03b3 from tree-dominated decays (Sec. 4.4) is used as a constraint, a value of \u22122\u03b2 s can be obtained. There are not enough observables in the B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay alone, but a U-spin relation with B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays that are discussed in the next subsection can be exploited [320,364,365]. Such an interpretation has been made by LHCb [363]. As shown in Fig. 22, it is found that the sensitivity to \u03b3 depends strongly on the uncertainty assigned due to non-factorisable Uspin breaking effects. The result for \u22122\u03b2 s , however, appears more robust to such effects, and therefore this method could be used to obtain a complementary and competitive determination to that from B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 and similar decays (Sec. 4 discussed in the next subsection.

Indeed, the isospin triangles are found to be stretched and overlapping, which leads to good precision on \u03b1, as seen in Fig. 25. In this case, the isospin analysis benefits from the fact that the parameters of the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 channel are more tractable for experimental study [380][381][382], where existing results include a first measurement of S \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 , with large uncertainty [380]. However, improved determinations of the branching fraction and CP asymmetry for the longitudinal component of B + \u2192 \u03c1 + \u03c1 0 decays [383,384] are needed in order to constrain further the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 isospin triangles.",

A powerful way to probe the SM is through global fits which test the consistency of the different CP violation measurements, both with each other and with CP conserving quantities. Since studies of CP violation in the B sector allow all three angles of the Unitarity Triangle to be measured, and the two non-trivial lengths of sides can also be determined, the apex of the triangle, located at (\u03c1, \u03b7) as defined in Eq. 8, can be over-constrained. Each measurement defines an allowed area, at a given confidence level, in the (\u03c1, \u03b7) plane; within the SM all these areas must overlap at the true position of the apex of the Unitarity Triangle. Any inconsistency between measurements would therefore indicate physics beyond the SM.",

Among the observables related to CP violation in the B system, these include \u03b2 and \u03b2 s from b \u2192 ccs transitions (see Sec. 4.2), \u03b3 from interference between b \u2192 c\u016bs and b \u2192 ucs transitions (see Sec. 4.4) and \u03b1 from b \u2192 u\u016bd transitions (see Sec. 6.3). The lengths of the two sides of the Unitarity Triangle are obtained from the relative magnitudes of CKM matrix elements |V ub /V cb |, determined from semileptonic B decays [401], and |V td /V ts |, determined from neutral B meson oscillation frequencies [402]; in both cases calculations of relevant hadronic quantities are also needed. The parameter of CP violation of K 0 -K 0 mixing, K , is also usually included and provides a constraint in the (\u03c1, \u03b7) plane in the shape of a hyperbola [403]. The results of the most recent analyses from the CKMfitter and UTfit collaborations are reproduced in Fig. 26; both show excellent consistency with the SM picture. It is worth noting, however, that another analysis [404] using more recent lattice QCD calculations of hadronic parameters relevant to B 0 (s) -B 0 (s) mixing [405], indicates some tension in the fit. The agreement with the SM can be quantified by excluding direct measurements of one of the parameters as inputs to the fit, and comparing the prediction for that quantity, obtained from the fit results, to the measured value. Comparison of the predicted and measured values of the angle \u03b3 is particularly interesting, as the fit is dominated by quantities determined from loop-level processes, while the measurement is obtained from Figure 26: Results of the latest (left) CKMfitter [374] and (right) UTFit [375] global fits to the CKM matrix parameters, showing good agreement with the SM picture of quark transitions.",

This necessitates an order of magnitude improvement in experimental precision as well as strict control of theoretical uncertainties that are associated with the interpretation of experimental observables in terms of CKM matrix parameters. The already approved Belle II [19,96] and upgraded LHCb [20,97] experiments will deliver the necessary increase in recorded luminosity by the the mid-2020s, while ATLAS and CMS are expected to continue to contribute a few important measurements, in particular with decays such as B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 which have high trigger efficiencies. There are also good prospects for further reduction of uncertainties associated to quantities obtained from lattice QCD calculations [413].",

Comparisons of the types of measurements mediated by different quark-level transitions, as outlined in Secs. 4-6, will enable the CKM paradigm to be tested at unprecedented precision.

Since the currently achieved precision is far from the level at which these approaches are expected to reach fundamental limitations, significant further progress can be anticipated. A next generation of experiments is planned, and there are exciting prospects for significant advances in this sector in the next ten years. Some of these, such as the observation of CP violation in b baryon decays, and of CP violation in mixing/decay interference in the B 0 s system, are anticipated within the SM. For some others it remains to be seen whether or not the effects seen in the data can be explained by SM dynamics alone: these include the K\u03c0 puzzle and the large asymmetries seen in regions of phase space of charmless three-body B decays. There are also observables where any observation of CP violation at the achievable precision would be a clear signal of beyond SM physics: examples include the parameters of CP violation in both B 0 and B 0 s mixing, or in decays to final states involving photons or leptons. The powerful approach of testing the consistency of the SM paradigm through global fits to CKM matrix parameters requires improved measurements of several important quantities including \u03b3, \u03b2 and \u03b2 s .",

Similarly to the methods discussed in Sec. 4.2, the determination of cos(2\u03b2) can remove the ambiguity inherent in measurements of sin(2\u03b2) alone. Measurements of CP violation in the decay-time dependence of B 0 decays mediated by the b \u2192 c\u016bd transition have been performed combining many final states of the form D ( * ) h 0 , where h 0 is a light meson (such as \u03c0 0 or \u03b7).
