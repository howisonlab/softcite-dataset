Understanding the nature of cosmogenic backgrounds is particularly important for future experiments aiming to determine the pep and CNO solar neutrino fluxes, for which the background is dominated by the spallation production of 11 C. Data from the Kamioka liquid-scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) provides valuable information for better understanding these backgrounds, especially in liquid scintillators, and for checking estimates from current simulations based upon MUSIC, FLUKA, and GEANT4. Using the time correlation between detected muons and neutron captures, the neutron production yield in the KamLAND liquid scintillator is measured to be Y n = (2.8 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u00b5 \u22121 g \u22121 cm 2 . For other isotopes, the production yield is determined from the observed time correlation related to known isotope lifetimes. We find some yields are inconsistent with extrapolations based on an accelerator muon beam experiment.",

The energy dependence was studied with 100 and 190 GeV incident muons. The production yield at other energies is estimated from these data by extrapolation, assuming a power-law dependence on the muon energy. Direct measurements of the production yield by underground detectors such as the Mont Blanc liquid scintillation detector (LSD) [11], the INFN large-volume detector (LVD) [12], and Borexino [13] were compared with calculations exploiting simulations based on MUSIC [14], FLUKA [15,16], and GEANT4 [17,18]. Particular attention was paid to neutron production, since isotope production measurements are difficult with the small scintillator masses used in these detectors. KamLAND, owing to its larger mass-\u223c1 kiloton of LS-does not suffer from this difficulty and is well placed to study a variety of isotopes of interest.",

The results are compared with simulations and other experiments. These comparisons provide important information for validating Monte Carlo simulations. protects the LS against the diffusion of ambient radon from the surrounding components. The total volume of LS in the balloon is 1171 \u00b1 25 m 3 as determined with flow meters during the initial filling. The LS consists of 80% dodecane and 20% pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) by volume, and 1.36 \u00b1 0.03 g/liter of the fluor PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole). The density of the LS is 0.780 g/cm 3 at 11.5 \u2022 C. The calculated elemental composition of the LS is given in Table I. A buffer comprising 57% isoparaffin and 43% dodecane oils by volume fills the region between the balloon and the surrounding 18-m-diameter spherical stainless-steel outer vessel to shield the LS from external radiation. The specific gravity of the buffer oil (BO) is adjusted to be 0.04% lower than that of the LS. An array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)-1325 specially developed fast PMTs masked to 17 in. diameter and 554 older 20-in.-diameter PMTs reused from the Kamiokande experiment [21]-are mounted on the inner surface of the outer containment vessel, providing 34% photocathode coverage. During the period from 5 March 2002 to 27 February 2003, the photocathode coverage was only 22%, TABLE I. Elemental composition of the KamLAND liquid scintillator. The hydrogen-to-carbon ratio was verified by elemental analysis (\u00b12%). The liquid scintillator contains traces of nitrogen and oxygen from its fluor, PPO (C 15 H 11 NO), and dissolved gases. Measurements in similar liquid hydrocarbons [19,20] indicate that the amount of dissolved nitrogen saturates at about 200-500 parts per million (ppm). The range of nitrogen composition values given in this table reflects the extreme cases of zero dissolved nitrogen gas to full saturation. The dissolved oxygen content of liquid scintillator taken from the center of KamLAND was measured to be less than 3 ppm, which is insignificant compared to the oxygen contribution from PPO. 025807-2 since the 20-in. PMTs were not operated. A 3-mm-thick acrylic barrier at 16.6 m in diameter helps prevent radon emanating from the PMT glass from entering the BO. The inner detector (ID), consisting of the LS and BO regions, is surrounded by a 3.2-kton water-Cherenkov detector instrumented with 225 20-in. PMTs. This outer detector (OD) absorbs \u03b3 rays and neutrons from the surrounding rock and enables tagging of cosmic-ray muons. The KamLAND front-end electronics (FEE) system is based on the analog transient waveform digitizer (ATWD) [22] which captures PMT signals in 128 10-bit digital samples at intervals of 1.5 ns. Each ATWD captures three gain levels of a PMT signal to obtain a dynamic range from 1 photoelectron (p.e.) to 1000 p.e. Each ATWD takes 27 \u00b5s to read out, so two are attached to each PMT channel to reduce dead time. The FEE system contains discriminators set at 0.15 p.e. (\u223c0.3 mV) threshold which send a 125-ns-long logic signal to the trigger electronics. The trigger electronics counts the number of ID and OD PMTs above the discriminator threshold with a sampling rate of 40 MHz and initiates readout when the number of 17-in. ID PMTs above the discriminator threshold (N 17 ) exceeds the number corresponding to \u223c0.8 MeV deposited energy. The trigger system also issues independent readout commands when the number of OD PMTs above threshold exceeds a preset number.",

The ID muon track is reconstructed from arrival times of the first-arriving Cherenkov or scintillation photons at the PMTs. Since for relativistic muons the wavefront of the scintillation light proceeds at the Cherenkov angle, and since muons generate enough light to generate photoelectrons in every PMT, by restricting the fit to the first-arriving photons both Cherenkov and scintillation photons can be treated identically. The observed muon track is then established by minimizing time-of-flight deviations from hypothetical muon tracks. The fit converges for 97% of all ID muon events.

The correlations between L ID and the reconstructed muon track length in the BO and LS regions (L BO and L LS , respectively) are plotted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). A linear trend, corresponding to minimum ionizing muons, is apparent in both distributions. The slope of each line is the light yield per unit length in the respective material. In BO, where the light is predominantly Cherenkov, the light yield per unit length is found to be dL\u010c/dX = 31 \u00b1 2 p.e./cm; the fit was restricted to path lengths above 700 cm, since fits at shorter path lengths are complicated by the presence of PMTs which may obstruct some of the emitted light.

The LS muon rate is estimated by selecting muons with L ID > 4 \u00d7 10 4 p.e. and impact parameter <650 cm. The light yield cut has a negligible inefficiency for LS muons, while the impact parameter cut eliminates LS muons that reconstruct outside the balloon because of the resolution of the fitter algorithm. This provides the lower limit on the LS muon rate. An upper limit is established by removing the impact parameter cut and increasing the L ID cut to >10 5 p.e. to eliminate muons that pass through the BO without transversing the LS. This cut again has a small inefficiency for LS muons but does not eliminate muons which shower in the BO. Averaging the two measurements yields R \u00b5 = 0.198 \u00b1 0.014 Hz, where the error estimate is dominated by systematic uncertainties due to temporal variations, the difference between the two measurements, and the presence of muon bundles, in which multiple simultaneous muons may be tagged as single-muon events. Using the parametrization of Ref. [28], the effect of muon bundles was estimated to be <5%. The muon rate corresponds to an integrated muon intensity of J \u00b5 = 5.37 \u00b1 0.41 m 2 h \u22121 , where the error includes uncertainties in the shape of the LS volume but is dominated by the uncertainty in the muon rate. Using a cut of L > 10 6 p.e., which is equivalent to a \u223c3 GeV threshold, the rate of showering muons in the LS is \u223c0.03 Hz. It is possible that some atmospheric neutrino interactions leak into the LS muon sample. However, an estimate with the neutrino flux from Ref. [29] and cross sections from Ref. [30] gives less than 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Hz from atmospheric neutrinos. The muon track length distribution is shown in Fig. 5.

There are previous estimates of the mean energy E \u00b5 ranging from 198 GeV [31] to 285 GeV [10,32] at the Kamiokande, KamLAND, and SuperKamiokande detectors. The authors of Ref. [33] made a detailed determination of J \u00b5 and E \u00b5 using the muon simulation code (MUSIC) [14] to transport muons, generated according to the modified Gaisser parameterization [34] sea-level muon flux distribution, through a digital profile of Ikenoyama. Although this calculation reproduces the zenith and azimuthal angular distributions observed by KamLAND, as shown in Fig. 10 of Ref. [33], it overestimates J \u00b5 by 14% relative to this work. The calculation assumed a homogeneous rock entirely of the Inishi type (see Table II of Ref. [33] for the chemical composition), but other rock types, such as granite, limestone, and several types of metamorphic rock, are common in Ikenoyama in unknown quantities [35]. Table II shows the result of calculations of J \u00b5 and E \u00b5 using the same simulation method of Ref. [33] but for standard rock [36,37] and generic skarn, a generic mixture of rock types found in a skarn-type mine like that of Ikenoyama. Here, generic skarn is defined to be 70% granite and 30% calcite by weight. The J \u00b5 values range from 4.90 m 2 h \u22121 , for 2.75 g/cm 3 specific gravity generic skarn, to 6.71 m 2 h \u22121 , for 2.65 g/cm 3 specific gravity Inishi rock, while E \u00b5 varies from 254 to 268 GeV. The value of J \u00b5 for 2.70 g/cm 3 specific gravity standard rock is 5.38 m 2 h \u22121 , in excellent agreement with our measured value. The value of E \u00b5 for this rock is 259 GeV. We take E \u00b5 = 260 \u00b1 8 GeV, where the uncertainty is chosen to cover the full range for the various rock types. values for various rock types using the simulation method from Ref. [33]. The range in values for J \u00b5 and E \u00b5 corresponds to varying the specific gravity of the rock from 2.65 to 2.75 g/cm 3 . The generic skarn is defined to be 70% granite and 30% calcite (by weight) with the following properties: Z = 10.22, A = 20.55 a.u., and radiation length X 0 = 25.411 g/cm 2 . ",

The low-energy tails in the n 1 H and n 12 C peaks are caused by the electronics effect discussed in the text.

To avoid the electronics-induced distortions, the fit is restricted to the region T 1300 \u00b5s. The parameters N n and r B are free, but the mean capture time is constrained to \u03c4 n = 207.5 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5s with a Gaussian penalty function. This mean capture time is determined from two independent measurements of \u03c4 n : a 241 Am + 9 Be calibration source, and an analysis of a sample of neutrons generated by clean muons. These clean muons are identified by a multiplicity parameter \u03b7 T defined to be the number of trigger commands that follow the muon within a 10-ms period. Fits to the T distribution of the subset of neutrons selected with various limits on \u03b7 T demonstrate that muons with \u03b7 T < 10 give unbiased fit residuals. The value of \u03c4 n is 207.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5s from the clean muon sample and 205.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5s from the 241 Am + 9 Be source data. The observed 2.3-\u00b5s discrepancy between these values is not completely understood but is suspected to be caused by neutrons from the 241 Am + 9 Be source that are captured on the stainless-steel source capsule. In this analysis, we use the value \u03c4 n = 207.5 \u00b5s from the nonshowering muon sample with an uncertainty of \u00b12.8 \u00b5s covering both measurements.",

This efficiency is calculated using the MUSIC-based muon simulation described in Sec. III and the GEANT4-based Monte Carlo of KamLAND described in Sec. VI A. The muon simulation generates muons with a three-momentum distribution appropriate to the KamLAND site inside Ikenoyama. Muon transport is then modeled through KamLAND. In this simulation, neutrons are created and destroyed; neutrons that survive to thermalization are tracked until they are captured. Energy scale nonlinearities and the finite \u03b3 -ray resolution are included. Two competing effects of the LS-BO boundary are taken into account. The first is for neutrons produced by muons in the LS that leak out, leading to an under counting of neutrons. The second is for neutrons produced outside of the LS that leak in, primarily from the BO, leading to an over count. The leak-out fraction [(11.7 \u00b1 1.9)%] is larger than the leak-in fraction [(5.4 \u00b1 0.4)%], resulting in a net (6.7 \u00b1 2.0)% correction. The component of the efficiency related to the electronics dead time for high-multiplicity events is measured by comparing the number of recorded waveforms with the number of trigger commands. The correction is measured to be less than 2% for T 1300 \u00b5s. In counting neutrons, we use the definition by which the (n, 2n) reaction generates one new neutron and the (n, n ) reaction generates no new neutrons. This method gives an efficiency n = (89.4 \u00b1 3.8)% (broken down in Table III).",

N ( 9 C) is determined from a simultaneous binned maximum likelihood fit to the T distribution and a chi-square fit to the E vis distribution. The uncertainty in the energy scale parameters are treated in the same manner as the 8 Li-8 B analysis described in Sec. V B. In this fit, 8 Li, 8 B, and 9 Li are treated as possible contaminants, the amounts are constrained to the values obtained in the previously described analyses.

To measure this correction, muon-11 C event pairs were selected with and without the neutron requirement for a subset of the data where the 11 C candidate is required to be within 50 cm of the muon track; restricting the study to a subset of the data mitigated the reduced signalto-background ratio associated with relaxing the neutron requirement.

III) is used to study neutrons produced by muon-induced spallation in the material outside of the KamLAND ID. Some of these neutrons have sufficient energy to enter the ID, where they thermalize and capture. They can be identified by the coincidence of a prompt signal (for example, from n + p elastic scattering) and a delayed signal from the capture \u03b3 ray. This is the same inverse \u03b2-decay reaction signature used for \u03bd e detection, \u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n, where the e + is the prompt signal, and the \u03b3 ray from neutron capture is the delayed signal and therefore a potential background. These neutrons are also a background for dark-matter experiments that employ nuclear recoils as a detection method.",

A comparison between Monte Carlo and measurement of the distribution of the number of OD PMTs with signals above threshold for tracked and untracked muons reveals a deficiency of fast neutrons from untracked muons, consistent with the underproduction of neutrons by GEANT4 in concrete reported in Ref. [47]. Figure 18 shows the E vis distribution of the prompt events from the Monte Carlo simulation of tracked and untracked muons compared with the measured data. The measured data and the Monte Carlo simulation correspond to an equal live time exposure of 1368 days. Figure 19 shows the radial distribution of the prompt events relative to the KamLAND center. Both the measured data and the GEANT4 simulation exhibit an exponential attenuation of the neutrons as they penetrate farther into the detector, with the simulation yielding an attenuation length of 69 \u00b1 2 g/cm 2 , consistent with the measurement 70 \u00b1 2 g/cm 2 .",
