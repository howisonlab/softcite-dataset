The production cross section for this process is highly sensitive to the absolute values of the top quark Yukawa coupling, y t ; the Higgs boson coupling to vector bosons, g HVV ; and, uniquely, their relative sign. Analyses using multilepton signatures, targeting H \u2192 WW, H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, and H \u2192 ZZ decay modes, and signatures with a single lepton and a bb pair, targeting the H \u2192 bb decay, are combined with a reinterpretation of a measurement in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel to constrain y t . For a standard model-like value of g HVV , the data favor positive values of y t and exclude values of y t below about \u22120.9y t SM .",

In particular, its couplings to bosons (g HVV ) and fermions (y f ) corroborate a SM-like dependence on the respective masses. Furthermore, data indicate that it has zero spin and positive parity [5]. Recently, the associated production of top quark pairs with a Higgs boson (ttH) and Higgs boson decays to pairs of bottom quarks have been observed [6][7][8], thereby directly probing the Yukawa interactions between the Higgs boson and top as well as bottom quarks for the first time. In addition to measuring the absolute strengths of Higgs boson couplings, it is pertinent to assess the possible existence of relative phases among the couplings, as well as their general Lorentz structure. Hence, a broad sweep of Higgs boson production mechanisms and decay modes must be considered to reveal any potential deviations from the SM expectations.",

            "text": "In the SM, the interference between these two diagrams is maximally destructive and leads to very small production cross sections of about 71, 16, and 2.9 fb for the t channel, tW process, and s channel, respectively, at a center-of-mass energy ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 13 TeV [18,19]. Hence, measurements using the data collected at the LHC so far are not yet sensitive to the SM production. However, in the presence of new physics, there may be relative opposite signs between the t-H and W-H couplings which lead to constructive interference and enhance the cross sections by an order of magnitude or more. In such scenarios, realized, e.g., in some two-Higgs doublet models [20], tHq production would exceed that of ttH production, making it accessible with current LHC data sets. In this paper, the tHq and tHW processes are collectively referred to as tH production, while s channel production is neglected. The event topology of tHq production is that of two heavy objects-the top quark and the Higgs boson-in the central portion of the detector recoiling against one another, while a light-flavor quark and a soft b quark escape in the forward-backward regions of the detector. Leptonic top quark decays produce high-momentum electrons and muons that can be used to trigger the detector readout. Higgs boson decays to vector bosons or \u03c4 leptons (H \u2192 WW \u00c3 , ZZ \u00c3 , or \u03c4\u03c4), which subsequently decay to light leptons (l \u00bc e AE , \u03bc AE ), lead to a multilepton final state with comparatively small background contributions from other processes. Higgs boson decays to bottom quarkantiquark pairs (H \u2192 bb), on the other hand, provide a larger event rate, albeit with challenging backgrounds from tt \u00fe jets production. In contrast, the rarer Higgs boson decays to two photons (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) result in easily triggered and relatively clean signals for both leptonic or fully hadronic top quark decays, with backgrounds mainly from other production modes of the Higgs boson. The production of tHW lacks the presence of forward activity and involves three heavy objects and therefore does not exhibit the defining features of tHq events, while closely resembling the ttH topologies, having identical final states.",

This paper is structured as follows. The experimental setup and data samples are described in Secs. II and III, respectively. The two analysis channels and their event selection, background estimations, and signal extraction techniques are described in Secs. IV and V.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two end cap sections providing pseudorapidity coverage up to j\u03b7j < 3.0. Forward calorimeters employing Cherenkov light detection extend the acceptance to j\u03b7j < 5.0. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid with a fiducial coverage of j\u03b7j < 2.4. The silicon tracker system measures charged particles within the range j\u03b7j < 2.5. The impact parameters in the transverse and longitudinal direction are measured with an uncertainty of about 10 and 30 \u03bcm, respectively [23]. Tracks of isolated muons of transverse momentum p T \u2265 100 GeV and j\u03b7j < 1.4 are reconstructed with an efficiency close to 100% and a p T resolution of about 1.3 to 2% and smaller than 6% for higher values of \u03b7. For p T \u2264 1 TeV, the resolution in the central region is better than 10%. A two-level trigger system is used to reduce the rate of recorded events to a level suitable for data acquisition and storage. The first level of the CMS trigger system [24], composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to about 1 kHz. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the kinematic variables used in the analysis, can be found in Ref. [25].",

A dedicated algorithm takes into account the emission of bremsstrahlung photons and determines the energy loss [31]. A multivariate analysis (MVA) approach based on boosted decision trees (BDT) is employed to distinguish real electrons from hadrons mimicking an electron signature. Additional requirements are applied in order to remove electrons originating from photon conversions [30]. Both muons and electrons from signal events are expected to be isolated, while those from heavy-flavor decays are often situated near jets. Lepton isolation is quantified using the scalar p T sum over PF candidates reconstructed within a cone centered on the lepton direction and shrinking with increasing lepton p T . The effect of additional pp interactions in the same and nearby bunch crossings (pileup) on the lepton isolation is mitigated by considering only charged particles consistent with the PV in the sum and by subtracting an estimate of the contribution from neutral pileup particles within the cone area.",

Of particular interest among these are those with three or more charged leptons or with two leptons of the same electric charge, as they appear with comparatively low backgrounds. Selecting such events in pp collisions while requiring the presence of b-tagged jets typically yields a mixture of mostly tt \u00fe jets events with nonprompt leptons and events from the associated production of tt with a vector boson (ttW and ttZ) or with a Higgs boson (ttH) that decay to additional prompt leptons. The analysis described in this section separates the tHq signal from these two dominant background sources by training two multivariate classifiers using features such as the forward light jet, the difference in multiplicities of jets and b-tagged jets (\"b jets\"), as well as the kinematic properties of the leptons. The two classifier outputs are combined into a single binned distribution, which is then fit to the data to extract the signal yield and constrain the background contributions.",

[22], which target the ttH process for fully hadronic top quark decays and for single-lepton or dilepton decay modes, respectively. Events in the ttH leptonic category are selected to have at least one lepton well separated from the photons, and well reconstructed, as well as at least two jets of which at least one passes the medium b-tagging requirement. The ttH hadronic category is defined as events with no identified leptons and at least three jets, of which at least one is b tagged with the loose working point. The signal is modeled with a sum of Gaussian functions describing the diphoton invariant mass (m \u03b3\u03b3 ) shape derived from simulation. The background contribution is determined from the data without reliance on simulated events, using the discrete profiling method [4,62,63]. Different classes of models describing the falling m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution in the background processes are used as input to the method.

To derive constraints on \u03ba t for a fixed value of \u03ba V \u00bc 1.0, a scan of the likelihood ratio L\u00f0\u03ba t \u00de=L\u00f0\u03ba t \u00de is performed, where\u03ba t is the best fit value of \u03ba t . Figure 13 shows the negative of twice the logarithm of this likelihood ratio , for scans on the data, and for an Asimov data set [67] with SM expectations for ttH and tH. On this scale, a 95% confidence interval covers values below 3.84, while standard deviations are at values of 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. The expected performance for a SM-like signal is to favor a value of \u03ba t \u00bc 1.0 over one of \u03ba t \u00bc \u22121.0 by more than four standard deviations and to exclude values outside of about \u22120.5 and 1.6 at 95% C.L.. In the combined scan, the data slightly favor a positive value of \u03ba t over a negative one, by about 1.5 standard deviations, while excluding values outside the ranges of about \u00bd\u22120.9; \u22120.5 and [1.0, 2.1] at 95% CL. The sensitivity is driven by the \u03b3\u03b3 channel at negative values of the coupling modifiers and by the multilepton channels at positive values.",

Limits can be compared to the expected product of tH cross sections and branching fractions of 0.83, 0.28, and 0.077 pb for the inverted top quark Yukawa coupling, the \u03ba t \u00bc 0 scenario, and the SM, respectively. the distribution of the test statistic [67].

The fiducial cross section for SM-like tH production is limited to about 1.9 pb, with an expected limit of 0.9 pb, corresponding, respectively, to about 25 and 12 times the expected cross section times branching fraction in the combination of the channels explored. The visible discrepancy between observed and expected limits around \u03ba t \u00bc 0.0 is caused by the fact that the predicted ttH cross section vanishes in that scenario while the data favor even larger than expected yields for ttH.",

Dedicated analyses of multilepton final states and final states with single leptons and a pair of bottom quarks are combined with a reinterpretation of a measurement of Higgs bosons decaying to two photons for the final result. For standard model-like Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons, the data favor a positive value of the top quark Yukawa coupling, y t , by 1.5 standard deviations and exclude values outside the ranges of about \u00bd\u22120.9; \u22120.5 and [1.0, 2.1] times y t SM at the 95% confidence level.
