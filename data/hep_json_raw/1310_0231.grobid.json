In the Standard Model (SM), this decay proceeds via loop and box diagrams and is characterized by maximum CKM suppression. The SM prediction for the decay rate is B(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) = (7.81 \u00b1 0.80) \u00d7 10 \u221211 [1]. The relatively high precision is in part because the hadronic matrix element can be related to the experimentally well known semileptonic decay rate (K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd). The quoted uncertainty is dominated by the CKM parametric one, which is expected to decrease in the near future.",

In particular, the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass resolution will improve from 1.7 MeV/c 2 (NA48/2) to better than 1 MeV/c 2 (NA62). This is directly relevant for background suppression in LFV analyses, constraining the signal mass regions. For the K + \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 + analysis, the higher momentum kick provided by the spectrometer will eliminate the tail towards higher values of the reconstructed \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 + invariant mass from K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays followed by \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd decays in the spectrometer, which is a limiting factor in the NA48/2 data (Fig. 1).",

These decays are characterized by three charged particles in the final state (note that a \u03c0 0 is emitted in K + decay together with a charged particle). The expected rate of a generic level-0 (L0) three-track trigger is about 0.5 MHz (dominated by K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays). It is comparable to the total design L0 rate of 1 MHz. Therefore the strategy of triggering on all three-track decays (adopted earlier by NA48/2) is not feasible for the high beam rate environment of NA62, and calorimetric L0 trigger conditions have to be considered additionally. The following L0 trigger primitives have been considered:",

It has been argued that R K can be enhanced by O(1%) within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [14]. On the other hand, the potential new physics effects are constrained by other observables such as B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd decay rates [15]. R K is also sensitive to the neutrino mixing parameters within SM extensions involving a fourth generation of quarks and leptons [16] or sterile neutrinos [17]. The R K phase of the NA62 experiment (NA62-R K ), which took data in 2007-2008 using beam line and detector of the earlier NA48/2 experiment, has been optimized for a precision R K measurement. To minimize the systematic effects, the data were recorded at low beam intensity with a minimum bias trigger; the total number of K \u00b1 decays during the data taking amounted to \u223c 10% of that for the NA48/2 experiment. A sample of about 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 K \u00b1 e2 decays with a background of about 10% was collected. The final result of a measurement based on that data set is R K = (2.488 \u00b1 0.007 stat \u00b1 0.007 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [18]. The leading systematic uncertainties come from background subtraction (the background is due K \u00b1 decays and the muon halo of the kaon beams). The result is consistent with the earlier measurements and with the SM expectation and dominates the current world average, as seen in Fig. 3.",

Related measurements performed with data sets collected during the preceding stages of the kaon experimental programme at CERN serve as a proof of principle, and have already achieved record precisions.",
