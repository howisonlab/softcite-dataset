The helicity zero state, which corresponds to longitudinal polarization of the decay, is CP -even but the helicity \u00b11 states are not CP eigenstates. Fortunately this complication is avoided due to the experimental determination that the longitudinally polarized fraction is dominant f L = 0.977 \u00b1 0.024(stat) +0.015 \u22120.013 (syst). This and other \u03c1\u03c1 measurements are summarised in Tab. 1. The measurements of the branching fractions of B \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c1 0 and B \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 indicate that the penguin pollution is small in these modes compared with B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays 10 11 .

This result is of particular interest because there is a unique solution between 0 and 180 \u2022 , which helps to break the ambiguity on the \u03c1\u03c1 result, which is in itself more precise. We get a hint of direct CP violation at the 3.0 \u03c3 level. The first measurements of CP -violating asymmetries in B \u2192 a 1 \u03c0 decays with a \u00b1 1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 have recently been performed by BABAR using a \"quasi-two-body\"approach 15 . A full isospin analysis requires the pre-cise measurements of the branching fractions and asymmetries in the five modes B 0 \u2192 a + 1 \u03c0 \u2212 , a \u2212 1 \u03c0 + , a 0 1 \u03c0 0 , B + \u2192 a + 1 \u03c0 0 , a 0 1 \u03c0 + and in the charged conjugate modes. However, even measuring all the branching fractions and time-dependent CP asymmetries in the three B 0 decay modes, this isospin method for extracting the angle \u03b1 is not feasible with the present statistics. Assuming flavor SU(3) symmetry one can determine an upper bound on \u03b4\u03b1 a1\u03c0 using SU(3) related decays to a 1 \u03c0 16 . The measured CP parameters in this mode are shown in Tab. 2.

The size of the interference, and hence the sensitivity to \u03b3, is determined by the relative magnitudes of the two processes. The two diagrams considered here are those of B + \u2192 D 0 K + and B + \u2192 D 0 K + . In order for these two processes to interfere it is required that the final state be the same. Here we examine the decay of the D 0 and D 0 to K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In this decay mode, there are four unknowns \u03b3, r B \u2261 |A(B + \u2192D 0 K + )| |A(B + \u2192D 0 K + )| , \u03b4 B (the strong phase of the B decay) and \u03b4 D (the strong phase of the D decay). This last parameter is eliminated by using the Dalitz plot structure of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay in the likelihood fit. This is determined by performing a full Dalitz plot analysis of this D decay mode using a very high statistics sample of D * + decays. The resulting amplitude model is then fixed in the fit. A simultaneous fit is then performed to the B + and B \u2212 data samples in order to determine \u03b3, \u03b4 B and r B . In addition to the Dalitz plot information, kinematic and event topology information is used to separate the signal and background events 18 .
