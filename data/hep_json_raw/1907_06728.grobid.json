The measured Z + jets cross-section is unfolded to the particle level. The cross-section is compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, including the next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, corrected for non-perturbative and QED radiation effects. The results of the measurements cover final-state jets with transverse momenta up to 1 TeV, and show good agreement with fixed-order calculations.",

The differential Z + jets cross-section is measured as functions of the Z boson transverse momentum and the jets' transverse momenta and rapidities, and as a function of the angular separation between the Z boson and jets in final states with different jet multiplicities. The experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [5] have an increased phase space compared to previous measurements by using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. The measurements at the LHC allow state-of-the-art theoreti-cal Z + jets predictions to be tested. These have recently been calculated to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in pQCD [16,17].",

An electron candidate is reconstructed if the cluster is matched to at least one track assigned to the primary vertex, as measured in the inner detector. The energy of a reconstructed electron candidate is given by the energy of a cluster that is enlarged to a size of 3 \u00d7 7 (5 \u00d7 5) in \u03b7-\u03c6 space in the central (endcap) electromagnetic calorimeter in order to take into account the shape of electromagnetic shower energy deposits in different calorimeter regions.

The 'loose' criteria identify electrons using a set of thresholds applied to cluster shape properties measured in the first and second LAr calorimeter layers, energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter, the number of hits in the pixel and SCT detectors, and the angular distance between the cluster position in the first LAr calorimeter layer and the extrapolated track.

In addition, the 'medium' selection sets conditions on the energy deposited in the third calorimeter layer, track properties in the TRT detector and the vertex position.

The combined multijet and W + jets background template is normalised to data using the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed electron pairs. A maximum-likelihood fit is used to adjust the normalisation of the combined multijet and W + jets background template relative to the measured Z + jets distribution. The normalisations of MC simulated samples are fixed in the fit: the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , diboson, tt and single-top-quark distributions are normalised by their fixedorder cross-sections, whereas the normalisation of the MC simulated Z + jets signal events is scaled to data to give the same total number of events near the peak of the Z mass spectrum in the 90 GeV < m ee < 92 GeV range. The combined multijet and W + jets background is fit to data in an extended m ee region, 60 GeV < m ee < 140 GeV, excluding the bins under the Z peak within the 80 GeV < m ee < 100 GeV region. The extended m ee region is used for the normalisation extraction only, as it allows more background events in the tails of the Z mass spectrum. The normalisation of the multijet and W + jets background template, calculated in the fit, is used to adjust the templates, obtained in the |y jet | and p jet T bins, to the Z + jets signal region.",

Theoretical predictions are calculated using various PDF sets. The coloured error bars represent the sum in quadrature of the effects of the PDF, scale, and \u03b1 S uncertainties, and the uncertainties from the non-perturbative and QED radiation corrections. The grey band shows the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurement except for the luminosity uncertainty of 1.9% tors Sherpa and Alpgen+Pythia, supplemented with parton shower simulations. Sherpa v. 1.4 and Alpgen+Pythia describe well the shape of the Z + jets distribution as a function of |y jet |, but not so well as a function of p jet T . Sherpa v. 2.2 is in good agreement with data in all bins of the measurement.",

The fixed-order theory predictions are corrected for the nonperturbative and QED radiation effects. The fixed-order calculations are performed using the CT14 PDF. The total statistical uncertainties are shown with error bars. The total uncertainties in the measurement and in the fixed-order theory predictions are represented with shaded bands. The total uncertainty in the measurement is the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic uncertainties except for the luminosity uncertainty of 1.9%. The total uncertainty in the fixed-order theory predictions is the sum in quadrature of the effects of the PDF, scale, and \u03b1 S uncertainties, and the uncertainties from the non-perturbative and QED radiation corrections.
