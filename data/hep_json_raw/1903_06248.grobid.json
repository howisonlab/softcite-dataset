The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 . A functional form is fitted to the dilepton invariant-mass distribution to model the contribution from background processes, and a generic signal shape is used to determine the significance of observed deviations from this background estimate. No significant deviation is observed and upper limits are placed at the 95% confidence level on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio for various resonance width hypotheses. The derived limits are shown to be applicable to spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 signal hypotheses. For a set of benchmark models, the limits are converted into lower limits on the resonance mass and reach 4.5 TeV for the E 6 -motivated Z \u03c8 boson. Also presented are limits on Heavy Vector Triplet model couplings.",

A new high-mass spin-0 resonance, H , introduced as part of an extended scalar sector in some models, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [6], has higher decay rate into a pair of muons rather than electrons. The majority of searches for new neutral high-mass resonances have focused on a new spin-1 vector boson, generally referred to as Z , that appears in models with extended gauge symmetries. Typical benchmark models include the Sequential Standard Model Z SSM boson [7], which has the same fermion couplings as the SM Z boson, a Z \u03c7 and a Z \u03c8 boson of an E 6 -motivated Grand Unification model [8], or a Z HVT boson of the Heavy Vector Triplet model [9]. In the first two models, the Z boson is a singlet, associated with a new U(1) gauge group, and generally its couplings to the SM W and Z bosons are assumed to be zero.

Previous searches with 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV conducted by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [11,12] showed no significant excess and led to lower limits of up to 3.8 TeV for the mass of the Z \u03c8 boson. The analysis presented in this Letter, compared with that published in Ref. [11], benefits from: a factor of four increase in integrated luminosity; several improvements in the reconstruction software, including the use of a new dynamical, topological cell-clustering algorithm for electron reconstruction [13] and an improved treatment of the relative alignment of the inner tracker and the muon tracking detectors in the muon reconstruction; the use of invariant-mass sidebands of the expected signal in data to constrain the fit parameters of the background distribution, which is described by a smooth functional form instead of relying on simulation; and a generic https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.07.016 0370-2693/\u00a9 2019 The Author.

Smooth templates for systematic shape uncertainties are produced using the same procedure as for the nominal templates. The uncertainties considered include variations due to PDFs [11] and normalisation of the tt background component [49]. Uncertainties on the multi-jet and W + jet background contributions [11] are also considered in the dielectron channel. For the selected function, the largest spurious signal (accounting for all systematic variations) is required to be less than 30% of the statistical uncertainty in the fitted signal yield (from the background distribution) for the zerowidth signal. This criterion is relaxed to 50% for signals of greater width. The systematic uncertainty of the background estimate is mass dependent and corresponds to a functional interpolation between the highest maxima among the spurious-signal-yield distributions for all systematic variations.

No significant excess is observed. The largest deviations from the background-only hypothesis in the dielectron, dimuon and combined dilepton channels are observed at masses of 774 GeV, 267 GeV and 264 GeV for zero-width signals with a local p 0 of 2.9 \u03c3 , 2.4 \u03c3 and 2.3 \u03c3 and a global significance of 0.1 \u03c3 , 0.3 \u03c3 , and zero, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the upper limits on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio to two leptons of a single flavour for generic resonances of various relative widths as a function of their mass. The observed limits for pole masses ranging from 250 to 750 GeV are obtained with a spacing of 1 GeV. The granularity is reduced above that mass, but remains below the experimental resolution of the ee channel. The observed limit on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio ranges from 3.6 (13.1) fb at 250 GeV to about 0.014 (0.018) fb at 6 TeV for the zero (10%) relative width signal in the combined dilepton channel. The impact of systematic uncertainties on this search is small across all mass and width assumptions, resulting in the expected limits on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio to dileptons being (4-7)% weaker than those without systematic uncertainties. As all studied signal spin hypotheses (0, 1, 2) have efficiency values which are consistent within 4%, the limits shown above can be used for reinterpretation of models with such new resonances.",
