            "text": "A search is presented for \u03c4 slepton pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is carried out in events containing two \u03c4 leptons in the final state, on the assumption that each \u03c4 slepton decays primarily to a \u03c4 lepton and a neutralino. Events are considered in which each \u03c4 lepton decays to one or more hadrons and a neutrino, or in which one of the \u03c4 leptons decays instead to an electron or a muon and two neutrinos. The data, collected with the CMS detector in 2016 and 2017, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb \u22121 . The observed data are consistent with the standard model background expectation. The results are used to set 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross section for \u03c4 slepton pair production in various models for \u03c4 slepton masses between 90 and 200 GeV and neutralino masses of 1, 10, and 20 GeV. In the case of purely left-handed \u03c4 slepton production and decay to a \u03c4 lepton and a neutralino with a mass of 1 GeV, the strongest limit is obtained for a \u03c4 slepton mass of 125 GeV at a factor of 1.14 larger than the theoretical cross section.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is a possible extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics, characterized by the presence of superpartners for SM particles. The superpartners have the same quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, except for the spin, which differs by half a unit. One appealing feature of SUSY is that the cancellation of quadratic divergences in quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass from SM particles and their superpartners could resolve the fine tuning problem [9][10][11][12]. Another feature is that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable in SUSY models with R-parity conservation [13], and could be a dark matter (DM) candidate [14][15][16].",

We assume that the \u03c4 decays to a \u03c4 lepton and \u03c7 0 1 , the lightest neutralino, which is the LSP in this model. The search is challenging because of the extremely small production cross section expected for this signal, as well as the large backgrounds. The most sensitive previous searches for direct \u03c4 pair production were performed at the CERN LEP collider [28][29][30][31], excluding \u03c4 masses at 95% confidence level (CL) up to \u224890 GeV for neutralino masses up to 80 GeV in some models. At the LHC, the ATLAS [32,33] and CMS [34] Collaborations have also performed searches for direct \u03c4 pair production using 8 TeV data, and the CMS Collaboration has reported a search for direct \u03c4 pair production in an initial sample of 35.9 fb \u22121 at 13 TeV collected in 2016 [35]. This paper presents a significant improvement in search sensitivity, which was limited by the small signal production rates, through the incorporation of improved analysis techniques and the inclusion of the data collected in 2017. The data used correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb \u22121 .",

We consider both hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the \u03c4 lepton, in which it decays to one or more hadrons and a neutrino, or to an electron or muon and two neutrinos, respectively. Independent analyses are carried out in the final states with two hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h ) and with one \u03c4 h and an electron or a muon ( \u03c4 h , where = e or \u03bc). The presence of missing transverse momentum, which can originate from stable neutralinos as well as neutrinos from \u03c4 lepton decays, provides an important source of discriminating power between signal and background. We have introduced several improvements with respect to the analysis presented in Ref. [35] that are applied to both 2016 and 2017 data. We make use of dedicated machine learning techniques to enhance the search sensitivity. These include the incorporation of an improved \u03c4 h selection method that makes use of a deep neural network (DNN) for the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis, and of a boosted decision tree (BDT) for event selection in the \u03c4 h analyses. Improvements have also been made to the background-estimation techniques and to the search region (SR) definitions. The incorporation of these enhancements is expected to improve the search sensitivity by up to 50%, where the figure of merit considered is the 95% CL upper limit on the cross section for \u03c4 pair production obtained with the data collected in 2016. The improvement is less significant than expected, since it is found that the estimated signal acceptance is reduced when the fast detector simulation that was previously used to model signal events is replaced in this search with the more realistic, full Geant4-based detector simulation [36]. Differences in the signal acceptance for the fast and more accurate full detector simulations are mainly caused by differences in the reconstructed \u03c4 h visible transverse momentum ( p T ), which is found to have larger values in the case of the fast simulation.",

            "text": "We consider the superpartners of both left-and righthanded \u03c4 leptons, \u03c4 L and \u03c4 R . The cross section for \u03c4 L pair production is expected to be about a factor of three larger than for \u03c4 R pairs [37]. The experimental acceptance is also expected to be different for left-and right-handed assignments because of the differences in the polarization of the \u03c4 leptons produced in \u03c4 L and \u03c4 R decays. The decay products of hadronically and leptonically decaying \u03c4 leptons originating from \u03c4 R decays are predicted to have larger and smaller p T , respectively, than those originating from \u03c4 L decays. Two simplified models are studied for direct \u03c4 pair production. One model involves production of only \u03c4 L pairs and the other is for the degenerate case in which both \u03c4 L and \u03c4 R pairs are produced. No mixing is introduced between left-and righthanded states. We study models with \u03c4 masses ranging from 90 to 200 GeV. The LEP limits [28][29][30][31] place strong constraints on the allowed values of the \u03c4 mass below this range, while the search sensitivity for \u03c4 masses above this range is low as a result of the decrease in production cross section with increased mass. We also consider different assumptions for the \u03c7 0 1 mass, namely 1, 10, and 20 GeV. The search sensitivity decreases when the mass difference between the \u03c4 and \u03c7 0 1 becomes small, since the visible decay products in such cases have lower momentum, resulting in a loss of experimental acceptance for such signals.",

A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, reside within the solenoid volume. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [38]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, which reduces the event rate to about 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with definitions of the coordinate system and kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [39].",

The missing transverse momentum vector, p miss T , is computed as the negative of the vector sum of the p T of all PF candidates reconstructed in an event, and its magnitude p miss T is used in the search as a discriminator between signal and SM background. Events selected for the search are required to pass filters [41] designed to remove detector-and beam-related backgrounds, and must have at least one reconstructed vertex. Usually, more than one such vertex is reconstructed because of pileup, i.e., multiple proton-proton (pp) collisions within the same or neighboring bunch crossings. The mean num-ber of interactions per bunch crossing was 27 in 2016, and increased to 37 in 2017, assuming a total inelastic pp cross section of 80 mb. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value in summed object p 2 T is selected to be the primary pp interaction vertex (PV). These objects are defined by tracks associated with a given vertex that are clustered using a jet finding algorithm [42,43], and a more restricted form of the vector missing transverse momentum that is calculated from these track-based jets.",

The jet energies are corrected to account for the contribution from pileup interactions and to compensate for variations in the detector response [43,44]. To mitigate issues related to noise in the ECAL endcaps that led to significantly worse modeling of the p miss Jets in the search are required to have their axes within the tracker volume of |\u03b7| < 2.4. For the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis, we use jets with p T > 30 GeV, while for the \u03c4 h analyses, we veto events containing jets with p T > 20 GeV to provide efficient background rejection.

The efficiency for tagging b quarks originating from top quark decays is about 84%, while the misidentification rates for jets from charm quarks, and from light quarks or gluons, are about 41 and 11%, respectively. In the \u03c4 h analyses, the CSVv2 tagger [45] is used to identify b quark jets for the selection of background-enriched control regions (CRs).

Restrictions are imposed on the magnitude of the impact parameters of their tracks relative to the PV in the transverse plane (d xy ), and on the longitudinal displacement (d z ) of the point of closest approach.

The constituents of the reconstructed jets are used to identify individual \u03c4 lepton decay modes with one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions, or three charged hadrons. The \u03c4 h candidate momentum is determined from the reconstructed visible \u03c4 lepton decay products. The presence of extra particles within the jet that are incompatible with the reconstructed decay mode is used as a criterion to discriminate jets from \u03c4 h decays. A multivariate-analysis (MVA) based discriminant [48], which contains isolation as well as lifetime information, is used to suppress the rate for quark and gluon jets to be misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates. We employ a relaxed (\"very loose\") working point of this discriminant as a preselection requirement for the \u03c4 h candidates selected in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis, as well as in the extrapolation used to estimate the contributions of events to the background in which quark or gluon jets are misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates. This working point corresponds to an efficiency of \u224870% for a genuine \u03c4 h , and a misidentification rate of \u22481% for quark or gluon jets. A DNN is used to improve the discrimination of signal \u03c4 h candidates from background, as discussed in more detail below. Two working points are used in the \u03c4 h analysis: a \"very tight\" working point for selecting signal \u03c4 h candidates that provides stringent background rejection, and a \"loose\" working point for the extrapolation procedure to estimate the misidentified \u03c4 h background that provides higher efficiency and less background rejection. These working points, respectively, typically have efficiencies close to 45 and 67% for a genuine \u03c4 h , with misidentification rates of \u22480.2 and 1% for quark or gluon jets. Electrons and muons misidentified as a \u03c4 h are suppressed via criteria specifically developed for this purpose that are based on the consistency of information from the tracker, calorimeters, and muon detectors [48].",

            "text": "The dominant background in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state originates from misidentification of jets as \u03c4 h candidates, mainly in SM events exclusively comprising jets produced through the strong interaction of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These are referred to as QCD multijet events in what follows. To further improve the suppression of this background while retaining high signal efficiency, we have pursued a new approach for \u03c4 h isolation in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis that is based upon the application of a DNN that is fed information about the properties of PF candidates within an isolation cone with \u0394R < 0.5 around the \u03c4 h candidate. We refer to this as \"Deep Particle Flow\" (DeepPF) isolation. Charged PF candidates consistent with having originated from the PV, photon candidates, and neutral hadron candidates with p T > 0.5, 1, and 1.25 GeV, respectively, provide the inputs to the DeepPF algorithm. The list of observables incorporated for each PF candidate includes its p T relative to the \u03c4 h jet, \u0394R between the candidate and \u03c4 h , particle type, track quality information, and d xy , d z and their uncertainties, \u03c3 (d xy ) and \u03c3 (d z ). A convolutional DNN [49] is trained with simulated signal and background events. Signal \u03c4 h candidates are those that are matched to generator-level \u03c4 leptons from a mixture of processes that give rise to genuine \u03c4 leptons. Background candidates that fail the matching are taken from simulated W+jets and QCD multijet events. The DeepPF discriminator value is obtained by averaging the DNN output with the nominal MVA-based discriminant described above. The working point for DeepPF isolation is chosen to maintain a constant efficiency of \u224850%, 56%, and 56% as a function of p T for the three respective \u03c4 h decay modes: one charged hadron, one charged hadron with neutral pions, and three charged hadrons. Since the \u03c4 h candidate p T distribution in signal events depends on the \u03c4 and \u03c7 0 1 masses, this choice of discriminator and working points allows us to maintain high efficiency for \u03c4 pair production signals under a large range of mass hypotheses. The overall misidentification rate for jets not originating from \u03c4 leptons ranges from 0.15% to 0.4% depending on p T and decay mode.",

The data used for the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis are collected with two sets of triggers.

We recover some of the corresponding loss in sensitivity in the 2017 analysis by placing an upper bound of 50 GeV on the scalar p T sum of lowp T jets excluded from the p miss T calculation (H low T ). This restriction reduces the impact of background events with significant lowp T jet activity in the forward region, for which the p miss T would be overestimated.

The \u03a3m T and m T2 distributions of events in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state surviving the baseline selections are shown in Fig. 2.

In all distributions, the last bin includes overflow events. After applying a minimum requirement of m T2 > 25 GeV in all SRs, we subdivide events into low (25-50 GeV) and high (>50 GeV) m T2 regions, to improve the sensitivity to lower and higher \u03c4 mass signals, respectively. For each m T2 region, the \u03a3m T distribution is exploited to provide sensitivity for a large range of \u03c4 mass signals. We define three bins in \u03a3m T : 200-250, 250-300, and >300 GeV. Finally, we subdivide events in each m T2 and \u03a3m T region into the categories N j = 0 and N j \u2265 1. This binning is beneficial as background events passing the SR kinematic selections are largely characterized by additional jet activity, while signal contains very few additional jets. The 0-jet category therefore provides nearly background-free SRs. However, we retain the SRs with N j \u2265 1 that are also expected to contain signal events with ISR or pileup jets.

The DY+jets contribution, which is also a major background in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state (\u224820%), usually consists of events with two prompt \u03c4 leptons. This background is determined with simulation samples after applying corrections to match the normalization and to be consistent with variable distributions in collider data. The W+jets and QCD multijet backgrounds usually contain one or more jets misidentified as \u03c4 h and their contributions are determined via methods that rely on data. Finally, we have smaller contributions from other SM processes such as the production of Higgs bosons, dibosons, and top quark pairs with or without vector bosons. These are estimated via MC simulation with appropriate correction factors applied as described in Sect. 3. For the \u03c4 h analyses, dedicated CRs that are each enriched in one of the major background processes are used to validate the modeling of the BDT distribution and to extract uncertainties that are used to account for any potential mismodeling of the distributions in simulation.

This background, which originates predominantly from QCD multijet and W+jets production, is predicted by extrapolating the event count in a data sample selected with a relaxed isolation requirement into the SR. The fraction of non-prompt or misidentified \u03c4 h candidates selected with the very loose MVA-based isolation working point that also pass the tight DeepPF isolation requirement is measured in a QCD multijet-enriched sample of same-charge \u03c4 h \u03c4 h events. The same-charge \u03c4 h \u03c4 h events are collected with the same \u03c4 h \u03c4 h trigger as opposite-charge \u03c4 h \u03c4 h events to avoid additional trigger-related biases. We also require m T2 to be low (<40 GeV) to reduce potential contributions from signal events. We find that roughly 20% of the same-charge events with misidentified \u03c4 h candidates selected with very loose isolation also pass the tight isolation requirement. However, the rate depends on the p T and decay mode (one-or threeprongs) of the \u03c4 h candidate, as well as the jet flavor, i.e., whether the misidentified jet originates from the hadronization of light-flavor quarks, heavy-flavor quarks, or gluons. The \u03c4 h misidentification rate is therefore measured in bins of p T and decay mode to mitigate the dependence on these factors. The measurement is also binned in the number of primary vertices (N PV ) to capture the effects of pileup. From studies performed with MC simulation samples, a systematic uncertainty of \u224830% is assigned to account for the dependence of the misidentification rate on jet flavor.",

We therefore use a high-purity Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 CR to compare the dimuon mass and p T spectra between data and simulation and use the observed differences to correct the simulation in the SRs with weights parameterized by generator-level Z boson mass and p T . The correction factors range up to 30% for high-mass and highp T values. Because these factors are intended to compensate for missing higher-order effects in the simulation, we assign the differences between the generator-level Z boson mass and p T distributions in LO and NLO simulated events as systematic uncertainties. The differences between data and simulation are taken into account through the use of scale factors, as described in Sect. 3.

We rely on an extrapolation in \u03c4 h isolation to obtain an estimate of the background originating from jets misidentified as \u03c4 h candidates. In the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis, the uncertainty in this extrapolation is dominated by the dependence of isolation on jet flavor. It also includes the statistical uncertainty associated with the CR samples from which the extrapolation factors are obtained, which can be significant in the case of search regions with limited event counts that are defined with stringent kinematic requirements. The uncertainty in the combined identification and isolation efficiency for prompt \u03c4 h candidates is also propagated to the final estimated uncertainty.

The limits are evaluated using likelihood fits with the signal strength, background event yields, and nuisance parameters corresponding to the uncertainties in the signal and background estimates as fitted parameters. The nuisance parameters are constrained within their uncertainties in the fit. We assume that the \u03c4 decays with 100% branching fraction to a \u03c4 lepton and a \u03c7 0 1 . The 95% CL upper limits on SUSY production cross sections are calculated using a modified frequentist approach with the CL s criterion [75,76].

Figure 8 shows the limits obtained for purely left-handed \u03c4 pair production, while Fig. 9 shows the limits obtained for the degenerate \u03c4 model in which both left-and right-handed \u03c4 pairs are produced. The \u03c4 h \u03c4 h analysis makes the dominant contribution to the search sensitivity. A slight excess of events over the background expectation in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h SRs results in an observed limit that is weaker than the expected limit. The strongest limits are observed in the case of a nearly massless \u03c7 0 1 . In general, the constraints are weaker for higher values of the \u03c7 0 1 mass because of smaller experimental acceptances. For \u03c4 masses above \u2248150 GeV, however, the sensitivity does not degrade significantly when the \u03c7 0 1 mass increases up to 20 GeV. In the purely left-handed model, the strongest limits are observed for a \u03c4 mass of 125 GeV where we exclude a \u03c4 pair production cross section of 132 fb. This value is a factor of 1.14 larger than the theoretical cross section. In the degenerate \u03c4 model we exclude \u03c4 masses between 90 and 150 GeV under the assumption of a nearly massless \u03c7 0 1 .",

Search regions are defined using kinematic observables that exploit expected differences in discriminants between signal and background. The data used for this search correspond to an integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb \u22121 collected in 2016 and 2017 with the CMS detector. No excess above the expected standard model background has been observed. Upper limits have been set on the cross section for direct \u03c4 pair production for simplified models in which each \u03c4 decays to a \u03c4 lepton and the lightest neutralino, with the latter being assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. For purely left-handed \u03c4 pair production, the analysis is most sensitive to a \u03c4 mass of 125 GeV when the neutralino is nearly massless. The observed limit is a factor of 1.14 larger than the expected production cross section in this model. The limits observed for left-handed \u03c4 pair production are the strongest obtained thus far for low values of the \u03c4 mass. In a more optimistic, degenerate production model, in which both left-and right-handed \u03c4 pairs are produced, we exclude \u03c4 masses up to 150 GeV, again under the assumption of a nearly massless neutralino. These results represent the first exclusion reported for this model for low values of the \u03c4 mass between 90 and 120 GeV. thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.

Electrons and muons have to satisfy I rel < 0.15 and <0.1, respectively. Backgrounds from tt and W+jets are greatly reduced by vetoing events that contain jets with p T > 20 GeV. Events from the W+jets background are further reduced by requiring the transverse mass m T ( , p miss T ), calculated using the electron",
