The signal and the background are simulated with the leading order event generator PYTHIA 6. The total cross-sections are taken from NLO calculations. Based on test beam data, the electron identification performance of the Transition Radiation Detector is extrapolated to high momenta. The expected yields for minimum-bias pp collisions at 14 TeV are presented. An isolation cut on the single electron, together with a minimum transverse momentum cut, allows to obtain a clear signal.

            "text": "The measurements of the W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons in pp and e + e \u2212 collisions have allowed precise test of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. In pp collisions at the LHC, the convergence of the NLO and NNLO calculations offers the possibility to use the total Z 0 cross section for a better understanding of the collider luminosity and the acceptance and efficiency of the detectors [1]. The high p T electrons emitted in the electronic Z 0 decays can be a controlled observable for checks of the p T calibration and resolution between 30 GeV/c and 50 GeV/c. In heavy ion collisions Z 0 is a good candidate for an alternative reference for quarkonium study, despite the large mass differences, m Z \u226bm J/\u03a8 , and the difference in production mechanisms, mainly qq for Z 0 and gg for quarkonium. It should be weakly affected by nuclear shadowing [2] and the presence of the Quark Gluon Plasma [3]. In this work, a feasibility study is presented to detect Z 0 through Z 0 \u2192e + e \u2212 in the central barrel of ALICE. The detection of the W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons through their muon decays in the ALICE muon spectrometer has been previously extensively studied [4].",

            "text": "The leading order event generator PYTHIA 6.326 [5] is used to simulate the production of Z 0 bosons. Only the lowest order Born processes, qq\u2192\u03b3 * /Z 0 , have been generated. The parton shower algorithm of PYTHIA produces additional jets, that mimic the contributions of higher processes, qq\u2192\u03b3 * /Zg and q(q)g\u2192\u03b3 * /Zq(q). The CTEQ5L PDFs are used. It was shown that the p T and y Z 0 distributions measured at Tevatron energies are well reproduced [6]. Pure Z 0 production, without the complete \u03b3 * /Z 0 interference, has been simulated in this work. Due to the large vector boson masses, the contributions of higher order QCD processes can be approximated by a k factor, found to be about 1.5 from comparison with measurements in pp collisions. The extrapolated cross sections for the LHC are summarized in Tab.I. The yields were calculated taking an inelastic pp cross section of 70 mb at 14 TeV. Calculations have been carried out up to NNLO. In the following we normalise all the cross section to the NNLO calculations [1]. The Inner Tracking System (ITS), Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Transition Radiator Detector (TRD) provide good tracking capability within their geometrical acceptance, |\u03b7|<0.9, 0<\u03c6<2\u03c0. The Particle Identification (PID) algorithm used requires that the particles are reconstructed in at least five planes of the TRD, which leads to an overall mean reconstruction efficiency of 80 %. The p T resolution is about 3.5 % at 100 GeV/c in the nominal 0.5 T magnetic field. To identify the electrons, the dE/dx of the TPC and the TRD are used. At such high p T , the main difficulty comes from the much more numerous \u03c0 \u00b1 that can be misidentified as electrons. The percentage of misidentified \u03c0 \u00b1 , the \u03c0 \u00b1 efficiency \u01eb \u03c0 , is determined for a given e \u00b1 efficiency, \u01eb e . The left panel of Fig.1 shows \u01eb T RD \u03c0 \u00b1 , as it has been obtained from test beam data analysis of small and big chambers [7] and from simulations done within the AliRoot framework [8]. The results of a one dimensional likelihood method, L-Q, can be improved by using a two dimensional method, L-Q1,Q2 or a neural network, NNs [7]. A fit of the L-Q1,Q2 performances allows to extrapolate \u01eb T RD \u03c0 to the p range of interest for the Z 0 . On the right panel of Fig.1, \u01eb T P C \u03c0 has been estimated with simulations for \u01eb T P C e =90 %. The final combined \u01eb \u03c0 for \u01eb e =81 % (=\u01eb T P C e \u00d7\u01eb T RD e =0.9\u00d70.9 ) is also plotted in Fig.1  The geometrical acceptance of the central barrel implies that both of the electrons have |\u03b7 e \u00b1 |<0.9. This reduces the Z 0 yield to 8.6 % of the full phase space yield (see Tab.II). The statistical errors are below 1 %. A clear signature of Z 0 decays is two high p T isolated electrons. A p T cut at 25 GeV/c is considered together with an isolation cut. It will reject a track i, if a track j is found to have: p j T >2 GeV, |\u03b7 i \u2212 \u03b7 j |\u22640.1 and |\u03c6 i \u2212 \u03c6 j |\u22640.1 rad. 99 % of the signal survives this cut. Fig.2 shows the generated m e + e \u2212 sim in the total phase space and in the geometrical acceptance with and without tracking and PID efficiencies. The reconstructed m e + e \u2212 rec is also plotted for different p T e \u00b1 cuts. Bremsstrahlung leads to a tail towards lower values of the mass.",

The jets have been simulated with the PYTHIA using Tune A CDF, that gives a total cross section of 54.7 mb [9]. Due to the high masses of the W boson and the top quark, only the lowest order processes for W production (qq \u2032 \u2192W ) and tt production (gg\u2192tt and qq\u2192tt) have been generated with PYTHIA and normalised to the NLO cross sections. For the lighter c and b quarks production, contributions from higher order corrections, like flavour excitations (qQ\u2192qQ) and gluon splitting (g\u2192QQ) have also been taken into account. The tuned PYTHIA [10] p T spectra of c and b have been compared to NLO predictions (HVQMNR program [11]) and found to be softer by an order 10 at very high p T .
