The spectrometric channel was organized as follows. A field-effect transistor was mounted on a Teflon plate near the Si(Li) detector and was cooled to a temperature close to liquid nitrogen. A preamplifier except for the first cascade was placed outside the passive shielding in order to reduce the background. A signal after the preamplifier was guided to two amplifiers with different amplification coefficients, which made it possible to measure the spectrum of signals in the low energy (0.5-60) keV and harder (10-500) keV regions. The measurement of two regions allowed the reliable control of the background in the natural radioactivity region. Each spectroscopic channel was equipped with its own analog-todigital converter. Thus, four 4096-channel spectra were simultaneously accumulated in computer memory (two energy ranges in coincidence and anticoincidence with an active shielding signal).",

In the model of the DFSZ axion, the relation between g Ae and m A for cos 2 \u03b2 = 1 has the form g Ae = 2.8\u00d710 \u221211 m A , where m A is expressed in eV units. The limit (7) leads to the bound m DF SZ A \u2264 7.9 eV (at 90% C.L.). The upper bound for the excluded m A values units is 15 keV (Fig.6). In the model of the KSVZ axion, g Ae and m A are related through Eq. (3). For the ratio E/N = 8/3, which is characteristic of most variants of the DFSZ axion, and n = 3, the region of excluded values m KSV Z A is (1.4-12) keV (Fig.6).",
