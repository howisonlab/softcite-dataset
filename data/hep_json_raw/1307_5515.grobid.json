The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. Events were collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb \u22121 and 19.6 fb \u22121 , respectively. The selected events are required to have opposite-sign electron or muon pairs. No excess above standard model predictions has been found in the 120-160 GeV mass range and the first limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 branching fraction at the LHC have been derived. The observed at 95% confidence level limits are between about 4 and 25 times the standard model cross section times the branching fraction. For a standard model Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV the expected limit at the 95% confidence level is 10 and the observed limit is 9.5. Models predicting the Higgs boson production cross section times the H \u2192 Z\u03b3 branching fraction to be larger than one order of magnitude of the standard model prediction are excluded for most of the 125-157 GeV mass range.",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, 13 m in length and 6 m in diameter, which provides an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume there are several particle detection systems. Charged particle trajectories are measured by silicon pixel and strip trackers, covering 0 \u03c6 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity, where \u03b7 is defined as \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)] and \u03b8 is the polar angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise proton beam direction. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter is distributed in a barrel region |\u03b7| < 1.48 and two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| = 3. A brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter surround the tracking volume and cover the region |\u03b7| < 3. Iron forward calorimeters with quartz fibers, read out by photomultipliers, extend the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 5. They provide measurements of the energy of photons, electrons, and hadron jets. A lead and silicon-strip preshower detector is located in front of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return-yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction. A two-tier trigger system selects protonproton collision events of interest for use in physics analysis.",

The fitting is unbinned and is performed over the 100-190 GeV mass range. The m \u03b3 distribution peaks around 110-115 GeV, with a steeply rising turn-on to the left and a gradually falling tail to the right. These characteristics are fitted to the convolution of a Gaussian with a step function multiplied by a polynomial.

These pseudo-data sets are fitted to a signal combined with a polynomial background model. The results of these fits are used to determine an appropriate degree of polynomial model for background, such that the bias introduced on the limit of the signal strength measurement is smaller than a fifth of the background statistical uncertainty. This is the same method used in the search for the Higgs boson decaying to \u03b3 \u03b3 and described in detail in [4]. A third-order polynomial is chosen for the dijet-tagged event class, a fourth-order polynomial is chosen to fit the event classes where both leptons and the photon are in the barrel, while a fifth-order polynomial is chosen to fit the event classes where the photon and at least one lepton are in the endcap. The description of the Higgs boson signal used in the search is obtained from simulated events produced by the next-to-leading order matrix-element generator powheg 1.0 [27,28] interfaced with pythia 6.4 [29] for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion process. The parton distribution functions (PDF) used to produce these samples is CT10 [30]. Associated production with a vector boson and associated production with a tt pair are simulated at leading order using pythia 6.4 and the CTEQ6L [31] PDF. The SM Higgs boson cross sections and branching fractions used are taken from Refs. [32,33]. The simulated signal events are weighted by taking into account the difference between data and simulated events so that the distribution of reconstructed vertices, the trigger efficiencies, the energy and momentum resolution, the energy scale, the reconstruction efficiency, and the isolation efficiency observed in data are reproduced for all reconstructed objects. An additional small correction is applied to the photons to reproduce the performance of the R 9 shower shape variable, by scaling the shower shape variable to match those observed in the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 ",
