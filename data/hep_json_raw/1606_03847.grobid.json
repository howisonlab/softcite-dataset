            "text": "Based on a sample of 1.31 \u00d7 10 9 J/\u03c8 events collected with the BESIII detector, an amplitude analysis of the isospin-violating decays \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is performed. A significant P -wave contribution from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is observed for the first time in \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The branching fraction is determined to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 ) = (7.44 \u00b1 0.60 \u00b1 1.26 \u00b1 1.84) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third model dependent. In addition to the non-resonant S-wave component, there is a significant \u03c3 meson component. The branching fractions of the combined S-wave components are determined to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )S = (37.63 \u00b1 0.77 \u00b1 2.22 \u00b1 4.48) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (35.22 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b1 2.54) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively. The latter one is consistent with previous BESIII measurements. The decays \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 are isospin-violating processes. Since the electromagnetic contribution is strongly suppressed [1,2] they are induced dominantly by the strong interaction via the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by the d \u2212 u quark mass difference. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in these decays because they allow the determination of the light quark mass difference using the ratios of decay widths, [3,4]. Within the framework of chiral effective field theory combined with a relativistic coupled-channel approach, Ref. [5] predicts that the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 P -wave contribution should be large for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . For the channel with three neutral pions, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , the P -wave contribution in two-body rescattering is forbidden by Bose symmetry. In general, the final state interaction is expected to be very important since it was already found to be essential to explain the decay width of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 [6,7]. In the case of \u03b7 \u2032 decays, the final state interaction is further enhanced due to the presence of nearby resonances and is expected to strongly affect the values of the branching fractions and the Dalitz plot distributions.",

In 2009, the CLEO-c experiment [8] reported the first observation of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 with 20.2 +6.1 \u22124.8 events, corresponding to a branching fraction of (37 \u00b1 11) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and a Dalitz plot consistent with a flat distribution. Recently the decay was also observed by the BESIII experiment [9] with a branching fraction consistent with the CLEO-c result; however, no Dalitz plot analysis was presented. Interest in the decay channel \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 stems from the observed 4\u03c3 discrepancy between the recent branching fraction measurement by BESIII [(35.6 \u00b1 4.0) \u00d7 10 \u22124 ] [9] and those from all previous experiments [10][11][12]. The BESIII result indicates a two times larger value for the ratio r 0 . Furthermore, the recent determination of the Dalitz plot slope parameter for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay gave \u03b1 = \u22120.687 \u00b1 0.061 [13] that deviates significantly from that for the phase space distribution (\u03b1 = 0). This implies that final state interactions play an essential role. In this Letter, we present an amplitude analysis combining \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events originating from J/\u03c8 radiative decays using 1.31 \u00d7 10 9 J/\u03c8 events [14,15] accumulated by the BESIII detector, which is described in detail in Ref. [16].",

The selection criteria for charged tracks and photon candidates are the same as those in Ref. [13]. Since the radiative photon from the J/\u03c8 is always more energetic than the photons from the \u03c0 0 decays, the photon candidate with the maximum en-ergy in the event is taken as the radiative one. For each \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 combination, a six-constraint (6C) kinematic fit is performed, and the \u03c7 2 6C is required to be less than 25. The fit enforces energy-momentum conservation and constrains the invariant masses of the other photon pair and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 to the nominal \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 mass, respectively. If there are more than three photon candidates in an event, the combination with the smallest \u03c7 2 6C is retained. To reject possible backgrounds with two or four photons in the final states, we further require that the probability of the 4C kinematic fit imposing energymomentum conservation for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 signal hypothesis is larger than those for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 background hypotheses. Additionally, events with |M (\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) \u2212 m \u03c9 | < 0.05 GeV/c 2 are rejected to suppress background from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .",

The possible background events are investigated with a MC sample of 1.2 \u00d7 10 9 J/\u03c8 inclusive decays generated with the Lundcharm and EvtGen models [17,18].

In order to estimate this background, an alternative data sample is selected by using a 5C kinematic fit without the \u03b7 \u2032 mass constraint. The resulting \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 invariant mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 (b), where the \u03b7 \u2032 peak is clearly visible. We then perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) distribution where the signal is described by the MC simulated shape convolved with a Gaussian resolution function, the peaking background (\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1) is described by the MC simulated shape and the non-peaking background contribution by a second-order Chebyshev polynomial function. The number of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1 events is fixed to the expected value, while the small peak around 1.02 GeV/c 2 from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c6 events is described with a Gaussian function. The number of non-peaking background events in the selected 6C-fitted sample is estimated to be 838 \u00b1 31, using the number of background events from the 5C-fitted sample in the \u03b7 \u2032 signal region (|M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) \u2212 0.958| < 0.02GeV/c 2 ) and taking into account the slight difference of detection efficiency between 5C and 6C kinematic requirements. To further verify the above background estimation, we checked the background shapes in \u03c0\u03c0 mass spectra of the data. For each mass bin, the number of background events is extracted by fitting the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum in this bin. We found that the background shapes are consistent with those estimated from the MC simulations. (More details are given in the Supplemental Material [21].) For J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 with \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , events containing at least seven photon candidates and no charged tracks are selected. The photon selection criteria are the same as those for \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The photon with the maximum energy in the event is assumed to be the radiative photon originating from the decay of J/\u03c8. For the remaining photon candidates, pairs of photons are combined to form \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidates which are subjected to a 1C kinematic fit, where the invariant mass of the photon pair is constrained to the nominal \u03c0 0 mass, and the \u03c7 2 value is required to be less than 25. To suppress \u03c0 0 mis-combinations, the \u03c0 0 decay angle (\u03b8 decay ), defined as the polar angle of a photon in the corresponding \u03b3\u03b3 rest frame, is required to satisfy | cos \u03b8 decay | < 0.95. From the accepted \u03c0 0 candidates and the corresponding radiative photon, \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 combinations are formed. A kinematic fit with eight constraints (8C) is performed, constraining the invariant masses of \u03b3\u03b3 pairs and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 candidates to the nominal \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 masses, respectively. Events with \u03c7 2 8C < 70 are accepted for further analysis. If there is more than one combination, only the one with the smallest \u03c7 2 8C is retained. To suppress possible background from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , a 7C kinematic fit is performed under the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 hypothesis and events for which the probability of this 7C fit is larger than that of the signal hypothesis are discarded. In addition, events which have at least one \u03b3\u03b3 pair with invariant mass within the \u03b7 signal region, (0.52, 0.59) GeV/c 2 , are rejected. Possible background from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is suppressed by vetoing events with |M (\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) \u2212 m \u03c9 | < 0.05 GeV/c 2 , where M (\u03b3\u03c0 0 ) is the invariant mass of a \u03b3\u03c0 0 combination.",

The analysis of the inclusive MC sample of 1.2 \u00d7 10 9 J/\u03c8 decays indicates a low background level, including the peaking background originating from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 with \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and the non-peaking background mainly coming from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , since the decay of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is forbidden. The number of background events from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is estimated to be 46 \u00b1 3, using a MC sample with the decay amplitudes from Ref. [22]. Similarly, we perform a 7C kinematic fit without applying the constraint on the \u03b7 \u2032 mass to estimate the non-peaking background. The fit to the M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) distribution is displayed in Fig. 2 (b) using the simulated shape convolved with a Gaussian resolution function for the signal, a MC simulated peaking background shape, and a second-order polynomial function for non-peaking background events. The number of the non-peaking background events in the selected \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 sample, predominantly originating from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , is estimated to be 176 \u00b1 24 after taking into account the detection efficiencies with and without the \u03b7 \u2032 mass constraint. A Dalitz plot analysis based on the formalism of the isobar model [23] is performed. The resonant \u03c0-\u03c0 S-wave (L = 0 for \u03c3) and P -wave (L = 1 for \u03c1 \u00b1 ) amplitudes are described following the formalism from Ref. [24],",

Therefore we are unable to determine the individual contributions and consider only the sum of the S-wave amplitudes in this analysis. To estimate the significance of each component, the fit is repeated with the corresponding amplitude excluded and the statistical significance is then determined by the changes of the \u22122 ln L value with the number of degree of freedom equals to twice the number of extra parameters in the fit [25]. The statistical significances of all the three components are found to be larger than 24\u03c3. To check for an additional contribution, we add an amplitude for the scalar meson f 0 (980), described by the Flatt\u00e9 function [26] with the parameters fixed using values from Ref. [27].

Due to the large interference between non-resonant and resonant S-waves, only the sum is used to describe the S-wave contribution, and the branching fractions are determined to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) S = (37.63 \u00b1 0.77 \u00b1 2.22 \u00b1 4.48) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (35.22 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b1 2.54) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively. The branching fractions of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 are in good agreement with and supersede the previous BESIII measurements [9]. The value for B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) is two times larger than that from GAMS [(16.0 \u00b1 3.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 ] [11]. The significant resonant S-wave contribution also provides a reasonable explanation for the negative slope parameter of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 Dalitz plot [13]. The ratio of the branching fractions between the S-wave components B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )/B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) S is determined as 0.94 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.13, where the common systematic uncertainties cancel out. With the branching fractions of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 taken from the PDG [20], r \u00b1 and r 0 are now calculated to be (8.77 \u00b1 1.19) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and (15.86 \u00b1 1.33) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , respectively.
