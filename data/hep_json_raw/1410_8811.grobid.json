            "text": "Introduction -In the last two decades, several experiments have observed neutrino oscillations compatible with the hypothesis of neutrino mixing in a three active flavours basis, described by the PMNS matrix [1]. Nevertheless, there exist experimental data that cannot be accommodated in this framework: the deficit of \u03bd e originating from intense radioactive sources in the calibration of the solar neutrino gallium detectors SAGE [2,3] and GALLEX [4] and \u03bd e rates near nuclear reactors [5]. Those experiments cover L/E values of order 1 m/ MeV, where L is the neutrino flight-path and E is the neutrino energy, too large to observe any sizeable effect for the standard neutrino mass differences. These anomalies can be interpreted as neutrino oscillations if the PMNS matrix is extended by introducing a new sterile neutrino \u03bd s (3+1 model) with a mass of order 1 eV/c 2 [5,6]. The deficit would be due to (\u2212) \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd s oscillations. The \u03bd e beam component is studied at the ND280 near detectors of the T2K experiment [7] to search for \u03bd e disappearance. The analysis presented here considers \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd s oscillations, given by the \u03bd e survival probability in the approximation of two neutrino mass states:",

Electron and muon neutrinos are produced from the decay of pions and kaons generated when a 30 GeV proton beam impinges on a graphite target. The detector ND280 sits 280 m from the proton target 2.5 \u2022 from the primary proton beam direction (off-axis) and observes interactions of neutrinos from the beam, whose \u03bd e component is peaked at an energy of 500 MeV. The present analysis uses neutrino interactions on polystyrene scintillator or water inside two Fine Grained Detectors (FGDs [15]) that corresponds to a total fiducial mass of about 1.6t. Three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs [16]) adjacent to the FGDs are used to identify particle type and momentum. Electromagnetic calorimeters (ECal [17]) that surround the FGDs/TPCs (the Tracker) along the beam direction (Barrel ECal) and downstream (DsECal) additionally separate electron showers from muon tracks. The \u03c0 0 detector (P0D [18]) is located upstream of the Tracker region and is used to veto interactions outside the FGDs in this analysis.",

At higher energies, neutrino CC interactions with pion production can take place. Those are CC resonant single \u03c0 production (CCRES), coherent \u03c0 production (CCCoh) and multi-\u03c0 production due to deep inelastic scattering (CCDIS). As the \u03bd \u00b5 flux is much larger than the \u03bd e flux, the relative rate of \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions is expected to be \u223c 100 times larger than the analysis signal, \u03bd e CC interactions.

The systematic uncertainties on the flux and \u03bd e -\u03bd \u00b5 common cross sections are constrained by fitting the \u03bd \u00b5 CC sample as described earlier. The unconstrained cross-section systematic uncertainties include several contributions: the difference between the interaction cross section of \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e , between \u03bd and\u03bd and the uncertainty on OOFV interactions. FSI uncertainties contribute 1.5% (2.7%) to the \u03bd e (\u03bd \u00b5 N \u2192 \u03c0 0 X) sample systematic uncertainty.
