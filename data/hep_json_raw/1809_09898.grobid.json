The dependence of Bose-Einstein correlation parameters on the charged-particle multiplicity is investigated. The correlation radius is observed to increase with multiplicity, while the chaoticity parameter decreases.

Results from two different analyses of this kind are described. The first measurement concerns Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) for same-sign pions, while the second one covers kinematic bb correlations. Both analyses are performed on data samples from high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions collected by the LHCb experiment [1,2]. The LHCb detector is a single-arm spectrometer which covers a pseudorapidity range of 2.0 < \u03b7 < 5.0. Such an acceptance in the forward region is unique among the LHC experiments and provides an additional input for understanding the process of particle production.",

It can be observed as an enhancement in the production of identical bosons that are close in phase space. By studying this kind of correlations a correlation radius [4] (often interpreted as the size of a spherical static particle source at the kinetic freeze-out) and a chaoticity parameter (related to the coherence of particle emission) can be determined. Studies of the BEC effect have been performed in multiple collision systems at e.g. LEP [5], RHIC [6] and LHC [7,8,9].

Due to their large masses, the b and c quarks are produced mainly in hard processes at the initial stage of the collision, which can be described in terms of perturbative QCD [11]. Studying kinematic correlations between heavy quark and antiquark can allow to put constraints on contributions from the specific production subprocesses (e.g. gluon-splitting, flavor-excitation) and improve modeling of such processes in the Monte Carlo generators. The bb correlations have been studied at e.g. SPS [12], Tevatron [13] and LHC [14,15]. The LHCb analysis [16] provides first results for high-energy pp collisions in the forward region, with a detector dedicated to heavy-flavor physics.

Reference samples can be constructed in different ways, under the condition that they do not contain the BEC effect. In this analysis, an eventmixed reference sample is used (pairs of pions from different events). Such a solution removes the BEC effect by definition, however also other types of correlations (e.g. long-range ones [20]) are not accounted for. Imperfections of the reference sample are reduced by introducing a double ratio, which is a ratio of C 2 (Q) for data to C 2 (Q) for MC with the BEC effect switched off. In this way, effects which are properly simulated are removed in the double ratio, such that in an ideal case it should only contain a pure BEC signal.

The efficiency correction [23] is based on both simulation and data-driven methods and takes into account efficiencies related to: the LHCb detector acceptance, reconstruction and selection of J/\u03c8 candidates, the muon identification and trigger. The variables used in the analysis are: difference in the azimuthal angle |\u0394\u03c6 * | and pseudorapidity |\u0394\u03b7 * | of the two beauty hadrons 1 , mass m J/\u03c8J/\u03c8 , transverse momentum p J/\u03c8J/\u03c8 T and rapidity y J/\u03c8J/\u03c8 of the J/\u03c8 pair, and the asymmetry between the p T of J/\u03c8 mesons",

The BEC parameters measured by LHCb in the forward region seem to be slightly lower than those observed by AT-LAS for corresponding charged-particle multiplicities. This may indicate that the BEC parameters depend on pseudorapidity, which is not predicted by the theoretical models. However, a more detailed comparison is planned by performing a full three-dimensional analysis with LHCb.",
