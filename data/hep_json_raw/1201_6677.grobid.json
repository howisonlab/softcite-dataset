The 2011 data taking period was characterized by a steep increase of the LHC instantaneous luminosity. A peak instantaneous luminosity of 3.5 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 was reached towards the end of the run and the total integrated luminosity recorded was about 5 fb \u22121 . The main ingredients for the CMS heavy flavor program are di-muon triggers combined with precise tracking and vertex reconstruction capabilities. The flexibility of the CMS trigger system has made it possible to adapt the online event selection algorithms to the increasing luminosity in a prompt and intelligent manner, by making use of invariant mass, decay length, distance of closest approach, transverse momentum, and rapidity in the trigger selection criteria. Due to bandwidth limitation the scope of the CMS heavy flavor program was limited to final states with di-or multi-muons and b-tagged jets.",

The latter are from decays of the type B \u2192 hh , where h and h are charged hadrons misidentified as muons. The expected number of combinatorial background events is evaluated by interpolating to the dimuon mass signal window the number of events observed in the sideband regions. The expected number of peaking background events is evaluated from MC and using muon misidentification rates measured from data. Three and one events are observed in the B s and B 0 mass windows, respectively. The number of observed events is consistent with the SM expectation for signal plus background and upper limits on the branching ratios are deter-mined with the CL s approach. The obtained limits at 95% C.L. are 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 for the B s and B 0 decays, respectively. The combination of CMS and LHCb upper limits for the B 0 s decay gives 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 95% C.L. [17].

A study of the angular decay distributions performed by the CDF Collaboration gave nonnegligible probabilities only for 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ [18]. Despite a large experimental effort, the nature of this new state is still uncertain and several models have been proposed to describe it. The X(3872) could be a conventional charmonium state, a loosely bound D * 0D0 molecule or a tetraquark state.

The CMS collaboration performed a measurement of the ratio of the production cross sections for the X(3872) and the \u03c8(2S ) resonances in the kinematic region defined by p T (X) > 8 GeV and |y(X)| < 2.2. The differences in acceptance and efficiency were accounted for by correction factors determined from Monte Carlo simulations. The X(3872) signal yield of 548 \u00b1 104 events was extracted from an unbinned log likelihood fit to the invariant mass spectrum of the J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system. The measured cross section ratio is R = 0.087 \u00b1 0.017 \u00b1 0.009, where the first error refers to the statistical uncertainty of the data and the second refers to the systematic uncertainty. The search for the X(3872) resonance was updated using a larger data set collected in 2011 and about 5 300 candidates were observed in 896 pb \u22121 [21], as shown in Figure 4. ",
