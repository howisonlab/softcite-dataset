The (weak) phases between different CKM matrix elements can be probed by studying the interference between two (or more) decay amplitudes. Particle and antiparticle amplitudes are related by the CP operator, where C signifies charge conjugation and P refers to the parity operator. Under the CP operation, weak phases flip sign, leading to different decay rates for particles and antiparticles, if the weak and (CP-invariant) strong phases differ between the contributing amplitudes. Precision measurements of the magnitudes and phases of the CKM elements provide constraints on many possible scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

The most promising method to determine \u03b3 is to study the interference between B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 decays, when states accessible to both the D 0 andD 0 mesons are selected. These modes are particularly attractive for the determination of \u03b3 because their amplitudes are dominated by only a pair of tree-level processes, leading to a small theoretical uncertainty [3]. Hereafter, we use D without a charge designation when the charm meson can be either a D 0 orD 0 . A number of methods, depending on the D decay mode, have been discussed in the literature and are often grouped into three categories: (i) CP eigenstates, such as D \u2192 K \u00fe K \u2212 and D \u2192 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [4,5] (GLW); (ii) flavor-specific final states, such as the Cabibbo-favored (CF) and doubly Cabibbo suppressed (DCS) D \u2192 K AE \u03c0 \u2213 decays [6,7] (ADS); and (iii) multibody self-conjugate final states, such as D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 [8] (GGSZ). 1 Beyond this simplest set of modes, these techniques are also applicable to modes with vector mesons, such as B \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3 K \u2212 ,B 0 \u2192 DK \u00c30 [9], and B 0 s \u2192 D\u03d5 [5], as well as b-baryon decays, e.g., \u039b 0 b \u2192 D\u039b [10][11][12] decays. It has also been suggested that other multibody final states of the recoiling strange quark system could be useful [13], due to the larger branching fractions to these final states and potentially a larger interference contribution.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [23] placed downstream of the magnet. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum, p, to 1.0% at 200 GeV=c , and an impact parameter measurement with a resolution of about 20 \u03bcm [24] for charged particles with large transverse momentum, p T . The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data taking to reduce asymmetries in the detection of charged particles. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [25]. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [26]. Details on the performance of the LHCb detector can be found in Ref. [27].",

The latter discriminates signal from combinatorial background based on information derived primarily from the tracking system. For the BDT, signal efficiencies are obtained from large samples of simulated signal decays. Particle identification efficiencies are obtained from a large D \u00c3\u00fe \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe calibration data sample [25], reweighted in p T , \u03b7, and the number of tracks in the event to match the distributions in the data. The effect of the BDT and PID selection requirements on the background is assessed using sidebands well away from the B \u2212 peak region. In the optimization, a wide range of selection requirements on the PID and BDT outputs are scanned, and we choose the value that optimizes the expected statistical precision of the B \u2212 \u2192 DX \u2212 s signal yield. Expected signal yields are evaluated based on known or estimated branching fractions and efficiencies obtained from simulation (for the BDT) or D \u00c3\u00fe \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe calibration data (for the PID). Due to the smaller expected yields in the ADS modes, separate optimizations are performed for the GLW and the ADS analyses. Using simulated decays, we find that the relative efficiencies for B \u2212 \u2192 DX \u2212 s and B \u2212 \u2192 DX \u2212 d decays across the phase space are compatible for the GLW and ADS selections. Due to the uniformity of the selections, and the fact that the observables are either double ratios, e.g. R CP\u00fe , or ratios involving almost identical final states, the systematic uncertainty on the relative efficiencies is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty.",

Moreover, these backgrounds could have large CP asymmetries, as seen in three-body B-meson decays [21,39,40]. It is therefore important to suppress their contribution to a negligible level. This is investigated by applying all of the above selections, except that D candidates are selected from a D mass sideband region instead of the signal region. The sideband region is chosen to avoid the contribution from the other two-body D decays with one misidentified daughter. Charmless backgrounds are seen in all modes. These backgrounds are reduced to a negligible level by requiring that the D decay vertex is displaced significantly downstream of the B \u2212 decay vertex, corresponding to three times the uncertainty on the measured D decay length.

This value is almost identical to the LHCb combined result of \u00f073 \u00fe9 \u221210 \u00de\u00b0found in Ref. [14]. The value of r B is similar to the values found in other B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decays [50,[53][54][55][56] but smaller than the value of 0.240 \u00fe0.055 \u22120.048 [57] found in neutral B-meson decays. The strong phase \u03b4 B , averaged over the phase space, peaks at 172\u00b0for both fits, but at 95% C.L. all angles are allowed. The constraints on the coherence factor are relatively weak; while the most likely value is close to 1, any value in the interval [0, 1] is allowed at one standard deviation.",
