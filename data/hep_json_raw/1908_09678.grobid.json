The vast majority of experiments makes use of the first term [e.g. Cavity experiments (ADMX), helioscopes (CAST), light-through-wall experiments (ALPS)]. In addition, astrophysical observations also provide sensitive limits to the axion-photon coupling. In general, it is rather difficult for these experiments to reach masses below 10 \u22126 eV, one reason being that the axion wave length a e-mail: pretz@physik.rwth-aachen.de becomes too large. Furthermore, these experiments are measuring rates proportional to at least a small amplitude squared. For the second (and third) term in the list (1) this is different. It turns out that the second term has the same structure as the QCD-\u03b8 term which is also responsible for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of nucleons. The axion field gives rise to an effective time-dependent \u03b8 -term and oscillates at a frequency proportional to the mass of the axion m a . This gives rise to an oscillating EDM. New opportunities to search for axions/ALPs with much higher sensitivity arise, because the signal is proportional to an amplitude A and not to its square. To date, NMR based methods are being used to look at oscillating EDMs [5].",

If the frequency is off be 1/T , with T being the measurement duration, the FOM drops to roughly 20%. Details are given in Appendix B.2. This suggests to take measurements separated by 1/T in frequency, as indicated by the additional blue and green FOM curves in Fig. 3. The upper dashed black curve which is roughly constant shows the sum of the FOMs from the measurements at the different frequencies. Experimentally one would not run at frequencies \u0394\u03c9T /(2\u03c0) = . . . , \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, . . . as indicated in Fig. 3 but rather sweep the frequency with the speed (= frequency per time) v = 1/T 2 .
