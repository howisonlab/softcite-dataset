The cross section is measured in the alljet decay channel of the top quark pair by selecting events containing at least eight jets, of which at least two are identified as originating from the hadronization of b quarks. A combination of multivariate analysis techniques is used to reduce the large background from multijet events not containing a top quark pair, and to help discriminate between jets originating from top quark decays and other additional jets. The cross section is determined for the total phase space to be 5.5 \u00b1 0.3 (stat) +1.6    \u22121.3 (syst) pb and also measured for two fiducial ttbb definitions. The measured cross sections are found to be larger than theoretical predictions by a factor of 1.5-2.4, corresponding to 1-2 standard deviations.",

            "text": "At the CERN LHC, top quark pairs are produced with copious amounts of additional jets, including those resulting from the hadronization of b quarks (b jets). Top quark pair production in association with a pair of b jets, ttbb, is challenging to model because of the very different energy scales for the b jets produced in association with the tt system and that of tt system [1], and because of the small but nonnegligible mass of the b quark. Improving the accuracy and the precision of perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for this process is crucial, since it represents an important background for numerous searches or other measurements at the LHC. In particular, tt production in association with a Higgs boson (ttH), where the Higgs boson decays to bb, suffers from an irreducible ttbb background [2][3][4][5][6][7]. Searches for four top quark production (tttt) are also affected by this background [8][9][10]. The two latter processes provide direct access to the top quark Yukawa coupling, a crucial parameter of the standard model [11,12]. An improved understanding of the ttbb process would help reduce the uncertainty in such measurements.",

The ttbb cross section at NLO, matched with parton showers, has also been calculated for massless b quarks (five-flavour scheme, 5FS) [16], and has recently become available for massive b quarks (four-flavour scheme, 4FS) [17][18][19]. A comparison of the measurements of the ttbb cross section with such calculations provides valuable guidance to improve the different frameworks. The ttbb cross section has been measured previously at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, in events containing one or two charged leptons [20][21][22][23][24]. This Letter focuses on the all-jet final state of the tt system, where each top quark decays into three jets, leading to a signature of four b jets and four light-quark jets for the ttbb system. This final state is favoured by a large branching fraction and provides a complete reconstruction of top quarks, as opposed to other decay channels of the top quark pairs. Moreover, the main uncertainties affecting the sensitivity in this measurement are different than those affecting final states containing leptons, therefore providing complementary information. However, the all-jet channel also suffers from a large background from multijet production, as well as from the difficulty of identifying jets that originate from decaying top quarks. Multivariate analysis techniques are developed and implemented to mitigate these problems. The ttbb cross section is measured using data collected by the CMS detector in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 [25].",

A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections reside within the solenoid field. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and end detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of its coordinate system and kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [26]. Samples of tt events are simulated at NLO in QCD using powheg (v2) [27][28][29][30]. These samples include ttbb events, where the additional b jets are generated by the parton shower. Single top quark production in the t channel or in association with a W boson, and ttH production are simulated at NLO with powheg [31][32][33]. Production of W or Z bosons in association with jets (V+jets), as well as QCD multijet events, are simulated at leading order (LO) with MadGraph5_amc@nlo (v2.2.2) [14], and the MLM merging scheme [34]. The MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator is used at NLO for simulating associated production of top quark pairs with W or Z bosons (ttV). Diboson processes (WW, WZ and ZZ) are simulated at LO using pythia (v8.219) [35].",

The BDT is trained using simulated tt events after applying the above preselection criteria, requiring the presence of at least seven jets, and reducing the number of permutations by requiring that \u03c7 2 < 33.38, corresponding to a p-value P (\u03c7 2 ) of 10 \u22126 for a \u03c7 2 distribution with four degrees of freedom. Events for which no permutation satisfies this requirement are rejected. The correct jetparton assignment is considered as a signal in the training, while all other distinguishable combinations are treated as background. Input variables used for the BDT include jet b tagging discriminator scores and kinematic quantities, such as invariant masses of pairs and triplets of jets, angular openings between jets, and the transverse momenta of jets. For each permutation, only quantities pertaining to the six jets assumed to originate from the top quarks are used in the training. The permutation yielding the highest BDT score is used for the rest of the analysis. For tt events with eight jets where all six jets from the top quark decays have been selected, the permutation BDT identifies the correct permutation with about 60% efficiency. As a further handle to reduce the multijet background, we have trained a second BDT to discriminate this background from inclusive tt+jets production. While supervised training of multivariate classifiers relies on samples of simulated events, the poor modelling of multijet production and the insufficient size of the available simulated samples limit the achievable discrimination power. A proposed method to alleviate these shortcomings is a classification without labels (CWoLa) [57]. In this weakly supervised approach, the classifier is trained using data, whereby one region in the data is treated as background and another independent region is treated as signal. In the limit of large training sample the resulting classifier converges to the optimal classifier to distinguish between signal and background, provided the two following conditions are fulfilled [57]. First, the relative rates of the actual signal and background processes should be different in the two regions. Second, the distributions of the variables entering the CWoLa classifier should be independent of the quantity used to define the two regions, for both the signal and background processes. The CWoLa BDT is trained using a sample of data with exactly seven jets, where two independent regions are defined by requiring that the QGLR is below or above 0.95. The first and second regions are expected to contain about 10 and 20% of tt events, respectively. Variables used for constructing the CWoLa BDT are kinematic quantities similar to those used in the permutation BDT, the output value of the permutation BDT, and the b tagging discriminator scores of the two jets identified by the permutation BDT as the b jets originating from the top quark decays. Only the six jets identified by the permutation BDT as coming from the top quark decays are used to define the CWoLa BDT input variables. The performance of the resulting classifier, measured in the region with at least eight jets, is found to be comparable to that of a supervised classifier trained using simulated samples.",

The impact of the choice of the matching scale h damp = 1.58m t between the matrix-element generator and the parton shower in powheg is evaluated using simulated samples generated with different choices of h damp = m t and 2.24m t [38].",

The uncertainty from the modelling of colour reconnection in the final state is evaluated by considering four alternatives to the pythia default, which is based on multiple-parton interactions (MPI) with early resonance decays (ERD) switched off. These alternatives are an MPIbased scheme with ERD switched on, a QCD-inspired scheme [59], and a gluon-move scheme with ERD either off or on [60]. All the alternative models were tuned to LHC data [61]. It has been verified that the selection efficiency obtained from the nominal tt simulation, in which additional b jets are generated by the parton shower, is in agreement within estimated modelling uncertainties with that obtained using a sample of ttbb events generated at NLO in QCD with massive b quarks (4FS) [19]. Since the spectrum of the top quark p T is known to be softer in the data than in the simulation, we evaluate the effect of this mismodelling by reweighting the generated events to match the top quark p T distribution measured in data [62]. The latter two uncertainties are not evaluated using profiled nuisance parameters, but by repeating the measurement using varied signal and background predictions. The differences in the measured cross sections are taken as the corresponding uncertainties and are added in quadrature with the uncertainty obtained from the profile likelihood. Uncertainties related to the \u03bc R and \u03bc F scales, the parton shower scale, and the h damp choice are taken to be uncorrelated for the ttbb, ttb, tt2b, ttcc and ttjj templates, while the other modelling uncertainties are taken to be correlated for all tt events. In addition to the aforementioned modelling uncertainties, we assign an uncertainty of 50% to the normalization of the ttcc background to cover the lack of precise measurements of this process. The results are stable when doubling that uncertainty.",

The cross section is first measured in a fiducial region of particle-level phase space by defining two categories of ttbb events, and subsequently this result is corrected to the total phase space. One of the defined fiducial regions corresponds to ignoring parton-level information, while the other uses parton-level information to identify the particle-level jets that do not originate from the decay of top quarks. For both definitions, the cross section is measured to be 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 (stat) +0.5 \u22120.4 (syst) pb. The cross section in the total phase space is obtained by correcting this measurement for the experimental acceptance on the jets originating from the top quarks, which yields 5.5 \u00b1 0.3 (stat) +1.6 \u22121.3 (syst) pb. This measurement provides valuable input to studies of the ttH process, where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of b quarks, and for which the normalization and modelling of the ttbb process represent a leading source of systematic uncertainty. Furthermore, these results represent a stringent test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at the LHC. Predictions from several generators are compared with measurements and found to be smaller than the measured values by a factor of 1.5-2.4, corresponding to 1-2 standard deviations. This is consistent with previous results for the ttbb cross section and calls for further experimental and theoretical studies of the associated production of top quark pairs and b jets. , and CR3 (lower left) regions. For clarity, the two-dimensional distribution with largest and next-to-largest b tagging discriminant scores for the additional jets have been unrolled to one dimension, and the resulting bins ordered according to increasing values of the ratio between expected signal and background yields in each bin of the SR.
