This is a leptophobic boson, with couplings only to first-and third-generation quarks, referred to as Model IV [8]. The properties of the boson are controlled by three parameters: the topcolour tilting parameter, cot \u03b8 H , which controls the width and the production cross-section, and f 1 and f 2 , which are related to the coupling to up-type and down-type quarks, respectively. Here f 1 = 1 and f 2 = 0, which maximises the fraction of Z TC2 bosons that decay into tt. The parameter cot \u03b8 H is tuned 1 for each mass point such that the resonance has a width of 1% of its mass [9]. Previous searches by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2,3] collaborations set lower limits of m(Z TC2 ) > 1.8 TeV and m(Z TC2 ) > 2.5 TeV, respectively, on the allowed mass for such bosons. As the detector resolution is not sufficient to resolve the resonance width for the Z TC2 model, limits are also quoted assuming a 3% width.

This kind of graviton (G KK ) is commonly referred to as a 'Bulk' RS graviton and is characterised by a dimensionless coupling constant k/M Pl \u223c 1, where k is the curvature of the warped extra dimension andM Pl = M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass. For these gravitons, decays into light fermions are suppressed and the branching ratio to photons is negligible. The primary production mode is gluon-gluon fusion as shown in Fig. 1b. The branching ratios to tt, W W , Z Z and H H are significant. In this particular model, k/M Pl is chosen to be 1, and the G KK width varies from 3% to 6% in the mass range 0.4-3 TeV. The branching ratio of the G KK decay into a tt pair increases rapidly from 18% to 50% for masses between 400 and 600 GeV, plateauing at 68% for masses larger than 1 TeV.

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. A high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and typically provides four measurements per track. The innermost layer, known as the insertable B-Layer [21], was added in 2014 and provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking performance. The silicon pixel detector is followed by a silicon microstrip tracker that typically provides four measurements from four strip double layers. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker (TRT), which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. 3 The TRT also provides electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 30 in total) above a higher energy-deposit threshold corresponding to transition radiation.

The overlap between tt and W t production was treated within the diagram removal (DR) scheme [32]. Electroweak t-channel single-top-quark events were generated using Powheg-Box v1 [33]. This generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix element calculations together with the four-flavour PDF set CT10f4. For this process, the top-quark decays were simulated using Mad-Spin [34], preserving all spin correlations. For all SM topquark processes the parton shower, fragmentation and the underlying event were simulated using Pythia v6.428 [35] with the CTEQ6L1 [36] PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 (P2012) set of tuned parameters [37]. The top quark's mass was set to 172.5 GeV. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [38] was used to model the decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. For the generation of tt events, the h damp parameter, which controls the transverse momentum of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, was set to the mass of the top quark. The main effect of this parameter is to regulate the high transverse momentum emission against which the tt system recoils. The top-quark kinematics in all SM tt samples were corrected to account for higher-order electroweak (EW) effects [39]. This correction to the generated samples was made by applying a weight that depends on the flavour and energy of the initial partons in the centreof-mass frame, and on the decay angle of the top quarks in the same frame. The value of the correction factor decreases with the invariant mass of the tt system from 0.98 at a mass of 0.4 TeV to 0.87 at a mass of 3.5 TeV.",

The jet energy is calibrated using a correction that relates the reconstructed jet energy to the true jet energy when reconstructed from stable particles with a lifetime of at least 30 ps (excluding muons and neutrinos) [60]. The correction depends on the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of each jet, and accounts for pile-up effects [61]. They are required to have transverse momentum, p T , greater than 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. For jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, a jet-vertextagger requirement corresponding to a 92% efficiency while rejecting 98% of jets from pile-up and noise is imposed [62]. Large-R jets are built from three-dimensional topological clusters of energy in the calorimeters, calibrated with the local cluster weighting (LCW) procedure [63], using the anti-k t algorithm with a radius parameter R = 1.0. In the LCW calibration procedure, corrections for the non-compensating response of the calorimeter and for the energy lost in dead material and from out-of-cluster leakage are applied to the cluster energy before applying the jet algorithm. These corrections are obtained from simulations of charged and neutral particles. These jets are further trimmed [64], which mitigates the effects of pile-up [65]. In trimming, the constituents of a jet are reclustered into subjets according to the k t algorithm [66][67][68] with a radius parameter R sub . Subjets with a transverse momentum smaller than a fraction f cut of the parent jet's transverse momentum are then discarded. The surviving subjets are recombined to produce the final trimmed jet. Based on a study of sensitivity to pile-up, the trimming parameters used are R sub = 0.2 and f cut = 0.05 [69]. The jets are calibrated using corrections that relate the reconstructed jet to its true jet when clustered from stable particles with a lifetime of at least 30 ps (excluding muons and neutrinos) [60,70]. The resultant jets are required to have p T > 300 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0. Large-R jets consistent with the decay products of a hadronically decaying top quark are identified (top-tagged) using an algorithm [71] based on the invariant mass of the jet and the N-subjettiness ratio \u03c4 32 [72,73]. This algorithm has an efficiency of approximately 80% for selecting top-quark jets with p T > 300 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0 in simulated SM tt events. Track-jets are built from charged-particle tracks using the anti-k t algorithm with a radius parameter R = 0.2. These jets are required to have p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 and at least two constituent chargedparticle tracks. The charged-particle tracks used to build the jets must themselves have p T > 0.4 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and pass quality requirements that test the number of hits used to reconstruct the track and the matching to the primary vertex [74]. Track-jets consistent with including the decay products of a b-hadron are identified (b-tagged) using the MV2c20 algorithm [75]. The b-tagging working point chosen has approximately 70% efficiency for such jets to contain a b-hadron in simulated SM tt events. The track-jets are used in this analysis for the identification of the b-tagged small-R calorimeter-measured jets. Small-R calorimetermeasured jets, j calo , are identified as b-jets if a trackjet that passes the b-tagging selection, j track , satisfies the R( j calo , j track ) < 0.4 requirement.",

The track isolation cone size is given by the minimum of R = 10 GeV/ p \u03bc T and R = 0.3, where p \u03bc T is the muon p T . Thus, the cone radius increases with decreasing p T up to a maximum of 0.3. To reduce the background contributions due to muons from heavy-flavour decays inside jets, muons are removed if they are separated from the nearest jet by R < 0.04 + 10 GeV/ p \u03bc T .

Electrons are also required to be isolated, using the same track-based variable as for muons, except that the maximum R in this case is 0.2. Electrons sharing the same track with a muon candidate are assumed to be bremsstrahlung photon and are rejected as electron candidates. To prevent double-counting of electron energy deposits as jets, the closest small-R jet within R = 0.2 of a reconstructed electron is removed. Finally, if the nearest small-R jet surviving this selection is within R = 0.4 of the electron, the electron is discarded, to ensure it is sufficiently separated from nearby jet activity.

This selection requirement has been found to effectively reject tt events not correctly reconstructed and a fair fraction of the other background, while improving the actual resolution on the ttbar mass system. The acceptance times efficiency (A \u00d7 ) including the branching ratio for simulated beyond-the-SM (BSM) particles decaying into tt is given in Fig. 2. For reference, the branching ratio for tt to electron-or muon-plus-jets is about 17% for each lepton flavour, taking into account leptonic . There are efficiency losses from the large-R jet requirements and the b-tagging requirement, as well as the four-jet and \u03c7 2 kinematic fit requirement in the resolved channel. The value of A \u00d7 is smaller for e+jets events than \u03bc+jets for resonance masses above 1.5 TeV, due to the inefficiency of the electron identification and overlap removal in an environment with highly boosted top quarks. For the Z and g KK signals, the A \u00d7 values are very similar to each other, whereas the total G KK A \u00d7 is about two percentage points higher than the other signals for masses greater than 0.8 TeV, because the G KK produces top quarks that are more central than those produced by g KK .",

EW corrections: the uncertainty in the EW corrections to tt production is 10% of their deviation from unity. NNLO QCD corrections: sensitivity of the m tt distribution to higher-order QCD corrections relative to the MC generators used is accounted for by adding an uncertainty covering the difference between NLO and NNLO QCD calculations of tt production. Corrections are derived from recent calculations [105] and applied as a function of top-quark p T and the transverse momentum of the tt system, following the recommended scales given in Ref. [105].
