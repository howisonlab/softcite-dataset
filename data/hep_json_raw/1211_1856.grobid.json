In these decays, some striking features become visible compared to mesonic decays. The largest branching fractions come with quite moderate multiplicities of 3-4 hadrons. We note that two-body decays to baryons are suppressed relative to three-and four-body decays. In most of these analyses, the invariant baryon-antibaryon mass shows an enhancement near the threshold. We propose a phenomenological interpretation of this quite common feature of hadronization to baryons.",

            "text": "A common feature observed in several B decays to baryons but also outside the B-physics sector is an enhancement at the invariant baryon-antibaryon mass threshold which can be seen for three examples in Fig. 1. Another feature of these decays is the multiplicity dependence of the branching fractions. Measurements from BABAR, Belle and CLEO show that the largest branching fractions for B decays to baryons come with quite moderate multiplicities. Comparing the branching fractions for B \u2192 \u039b + c p (n \u2022 \u03c0), as shown in Fig. 2 a rise in the branching fractions up to a multiplicity of five can be observed. The most prominent rise occurs when comparing the two-body mode with the three-body mode for non-resonant decays. For resonant decays (B \u2212 \u2192 \u03a3 0 c (2455)p) the difference between the two-body and the three-body mode is not as prominent. A comparison of B decays with a charmed meson in the final state, e.g. B \u2192 D ( * ) pp (n \u2022 \u03c0) [2], shows the highest branching fractions for a multiplicity of four hadrons in the final state.",

A simple model is given by M. Suzuki [4]. His interpretation is that for a baryon-antibaryon pair in a two-body decay a hard gluon (highly off mass shell) is needed, while in a decay mode with a higher multiplicity only soft gluons are needed. In consequence the two-body mode has to be suppressed. A more detailed model is given by T. Hartmann [5] which can explain the absence of a threshold enhancement in B decays to baryons. There, all contributing Feynman diagrams are divided into two contributing classes. For convenience for both classes the W exchange can be contracted to an effective four point interaction.",
