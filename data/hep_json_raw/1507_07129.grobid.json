            "text": "A search for the production of a heavy B quark, having electric charge \u22121=3 and vector couplings to W, Z, and H bosons, is carried out using proton-proton collision data recorded at the CERN LHC by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The B quark is assumed to be pair produced and to decay in one of three ways: to tW, bZ, or bH. The search is carried out in final states with one, two, and more than two charged leptons, as well as in fully hadronic final states. Each of the channels in the exclusive final-state topologies is designed to be sensitive to specific combinations of the B quarkantiquark pair decays. The observed event yields are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations in all the final states studied. A statistical combination of these results is performed, and upper limits are set on the cross section of the strongly produced B quark-antiquark pairs as a function of the B quark mass. Lower limits on the B quark mass between 740 and 900 GeV are set at a 95% confidence level, depending on the values of the branching fractions of the B quark to tW, bZ, and bH. Overall, these limits are the most stringent to date.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] has intensified the search for physics beyond the standard model (SM). Various extensions of the SM predict the existence of new heavy quarks, which arise quite naturally in grand unification schemes [4] and in composite Higgs [5,6], little Higgs [7][8][9][10], and top quark condensate [11] models. The couplings to the SM gauge bosons of the left-and righthanded components of these quarks are symmetric, so they are called vectorlike [12]. Vectorlike quarks may be singlets, doublets, or triplets under the electroweak SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de transformation [13]. They have bare mass terms that are invariant under the electroweak gauge transformation [14]. Moreover, their couplings to the scalar sector are independent of mass. Thus, the existence of vectorlike quarks is not ruled out by the recent discovery of a Higgs boson, in contrast to additional quarks in more conventional fourth-generation models [15].",

            "text": "In several beyond the standard model scenarios, vectorlike quarks are considered partners of the top and bottom quarks [16]. Both the charged-current [17] and the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) [18,19] decay processes are allowed. The ratio of the predicted rates depends on the model: in some models the FCNC process dominates [20]; in others the two modes are comparable in rate. This paper describes the search for a vectorlike B quark of electric charge \u22121=3, using data recorded by the CMS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-ofmass energy of 8 TeV at the CERN LHC in 2012. It is assumed that B quark-antiquark pairs are produced strongly for B quark masses within the range of this search, which extends to 1 TeV. The B quark may decay either via the charged-current process B \u2192 tW or via the FCNC processes B \u2192 bZ and B \u2192 bH. Feynman diagrams for the B quark pair production and decay processes are shown in Fig. 1. Searches are performed in several different final states, including those containing single leptons, lepton pairs (dileptons) of opposite or identical charge, three or more leptons, or consisting entirely of hadronic activity without any identified leptons. We search for an excess of events over the backgrounds in mutually exclusive final states and set limits on the pair-production cross section for all values of the B quark branching fractions with the constraint B\u00f0B \u2192 tW\u00de \u00fe B\u00f0B \u2192 bZ\u00de \u00fe B\u00f0B \u2192 bH\u00de \u00bc 1.",

Muons are measured in gasionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and end cap detectors. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz (the maximum allowed output from the first level) to around 400 Hz, before data storage.

The p T of charged particles originating at the primary vertex and the p T of the neutral particles and photons are summed in this cone (excluding the lepton candidate itself) to obtain the isolation variable. Contributions to the neutral hadron and photon energy components due to pileup interactions are subtracted. For the electron isolation, this contribution is determined using the jet area technique [46], which computes the transverse energy density of neutral particles using the median of the neutral energy distribution in a sample of jets with p T > 3 GeV. In the case of the muons, the pileup energy density from neutral particles is estimated to be half of that from charged hadrons, based on measurements performed in jets [47]. The difference between the isolation algorithms arises because electrons and muons are reconstructed using different techniques. Electrons, with large energy deposition in the calorimeters, behave similarly to jets in this respect, while the reconstruction of muons relies more heavily on tracking information. The isolation value, defined as the energy reconstructed in a cone of \u0394R \u00bc 0.3 (0.4) around an electron (muon) candidate, is required to be less than 0.15 (0.12) times the electron (muon) p T for the lepton to be considered isolated.

The missing transverse momentum vector is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E T . The quantity S T is defined as the scalar sum of the p T of the jets, lepton p T , and E T in the event. At very high Lorentz boost, the products of hadronically decaying bosons may be merged into a single reconstructed jet. In this regime, the W, Z, or Higgs bosons are identified as jets clustered with the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [52,53] using a larger distance parameter of 0.8 [54]. In this paper, they are referred to as CA8 jets. For bosons with p T above approximately 200 GeV, decay products are expected to be clustered into a single CA8 jet. Each CA8 jet can be decomposed into constituent subjets using a jet pruning algorithm [55] to resolve those decay products. The pruning algorithm removes soft and wide-angle components of the jet during a reclustering, and the last iteration of the clustering process is reversed to identify two subjet candidates within each pruned jet. Jet properties such as jet mass, N-subjettiness [56] (used to determine the consistency of a jet with N hypothesized subjets), and the mass drop, defined as the ratio of the most massive subjet to the mass of the pruned jet, are used to identify these bosons.",

For the single-lepton channel, two trigger selections are utilized: either a single electron with p T > 27 GeV or a single muon with p T > 40 GeV. For both of the lepton pair channels, as well as the multilepton channel, three trigger algorithms are used for final states including two electrons, two muons, or one electron and one muon. In each of these dilepton trigger algorithms, events are selected if the highest-p T lepton has p T > 17 GeV and the second-highest p T lepton has p T > 8 GeV. No charge requirement is applied in the trigger selection, allowing these trigger algorithms to be used in all three channels with two or more leptons. Finally, the all-hadronic channel uses a trigger algorithm requiring the total scalar p T sum of reconstructed jets (with p T > 30 GeV and j\u03b7j < 3.0) in the detector to be greater than 750 GeV.

The charge misidentification rate is extracted from the ratio of the number of events in this selection having same-sign lepton pairs to the number of events having those of opposite sign.

As we observe a difference between the simulated jet energy resolution and the jet energy resolution measured in data, we smear the jet energies in simulation to reflect the energy resolution observed in data. This procedure introduces a small uncertainty in the shape of jet kinematic properties in simulated events, including a normalization effect of less than 5%. In addition to the uncertainty in the measurement of integrated luminosity of 2.6% [58], several scale factors (SF) are applied to simulated events to reflect the differences with data in reconstruction efficiencies for various objects used in the event selections. The uncertainties in these SF measurements are applied to the relevant events.

This hypothesized particle could decay in one of three ways: to tW, bZ, or bH. The search is performed using five distinct topologies to maintain sensitivity to each of these decay modes. The topologies included in this search are the Lepton \u00fe jets final state, both the opposite-sign and same-sign lepton pair final states, the three or more leptons final state, and finally the all-hadronic final state targeting Higgs boson decays to pairs of bottom quarks.",

A scan over possible combinations of the branching fractions to tW, bZ, and bH is performed. For a B quark decaying with a branching fraction of 100% to bH, B quarks with masses up to 900 GeV are excluded, at 95% confidence level. This branching fraction corresponds to the highest excluded B quark mass in this scan. Observed exclusion limit results from a scan of all possible branching fractions range from a minimum of 740 to 900 GeV. The combination of these results provides the most stringent exclusion limit to date for the existence of a vectorlike B quark.",
