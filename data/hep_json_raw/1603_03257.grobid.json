No experimental results exist to date regarding CP violation in any of the radiative D decays. Radiative charm decays are dominated by long-range non-perturbative processes that can enhance the branching fractions up to 10 \u22124 , whereas short-range interactions are predicted to yield rates at the level of 10 \u22128 [9, 10]. Measurements of branching fractions of these decays can therefore be used to test the QCD-based calculations of long-distance dynamics. The radiative decay D 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 was first observed by Belle [11] and later measured with increased precision by BABAR [12]. In the same study, BABAR made the observation of D 0 \u2192 K * 0 (892)\u03b3. As for D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3, CLEO II has set an upper limit on its branching fraction at 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 [13]. In this Letter, we present the first observation of D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3, improved branching fraction measurements of D 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 and K * 0 \u03b3, as well as the first search for CP violation in all three decays. Inclusion of charge-conjugate modes is implied unless noted otherwise. The measurements are based on 943 fb \u22121 of data collected at or near the \u03a5(nS) resonances (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) with the Belle detector [14, 15], operating at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [16, 17]. The detector components relevant for our study are: a tracking system comprising a silicon vertex detector and a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), a particle identification (PID) system that consists of a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF) and an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), and a CsI(Tl) crystal-based electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL). All are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. We use Monte Carlo (MC) events, generated using EVTGEN [18], JETSET [19] and PHOTOS [20], followed with a GEANT3 [21] based detector simulation, representing six times the data luminosity, to devise selection criteria and investigate possible sources of background. The selection optimization is performed by maximizing S/ \u221a S + B, where S (B) is the number of signal (background) events in a signal window of the reconstructed D 0 invariant mass 1.8 GeV/c 2 < M (D 0 ) < 1.9 GeV/c 2 . The branching fraction of D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 is set to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in simulations in accordance with Ref. [7], while the branching fractions of the other two decay modes are set to their world-average values [22].",

There are two main 358 sources: those due to the selection criteria and those 359 arising from the signal extraction method, both for sig-360 nal and normalization modes. Some of the uncertain-361 ties from the first group cancel if they are common to 362 the signal and respective normalization mode, such as 363 those related to PID, vertex fit, and the requirement on 364 p CMS (D * + ). A 2.2% uncertainty is ascribed to photon 365 reconstruction efficiency [32]. Due to the presence of 366 the photon in the signal modes, the resolution of the q 367 distribution is worse than in the normalization modes.368 Thus, the related uncertainties cannot be assumed to 369 cancel completely. We separately estimate the uncer-370 tainty due to the q requirement using the control channel 371 D 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03c0 0 . For both MC and data, the efficiency is 372 estimated by calculating the ratio R of the signal yield, 373 extracted with and without the requirement on q. Then, 374 the double ratio R MC /R data is calculated to assess the 375 possible difference between simulation and data. We ob-376 tain R MC /R data (q) = 1.0100 \u00b1 0.0016. We do not correct 377 the efficiency by the central value; instead, we assign a 378 systematic uncertainty of 1.16%. 379 The double-ratio method is also used to estimate the 380 uncertainty due to the \u03c0 0 -veto requirement on the control 381 channel D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 . The veto is calculated by pairing 382 the first daughter photon (the more energetic one) of the 383 \u03c0 0 with all others, but for the second daughter. The ratio 384 R of so-discarded events is calculated for MC and data, 385 with all other selection criteria applied. The obtained 386 double ratio is R MC /R data (\u03c0 0 veto) = 1.002 \u00b1 0.005. The 387 error directly translates to the systematic uncertainty of 388 the efficiency.",

The obtained uncertainties are 0.2% for the \u03c1 mode, 0.1% for the \u03c6 mode, and 1.7% for the K * 0 mode. All uncertainties described above are summed in quadrature and the final value is listed as 'Efficiency' in Table II. They affect only the branching fraction, as they cancel in Eq. 2. For the fit procedure, a systematic uncertainty must be ascribed to every parameter that is determined and fixed to MC values but might differ in data. The fit procedure is repeated with each parameter varied by its uncertainty on the positive and negative sides. The larger deviation from the nominal branching fraction or A CP value is taken as the double-sided systematic error and these are summed in quadrature for all parameters. An uncertainty is assigned to the calibration offset and width of the \u03c0 0 -type backgrounds. For the \u03c6 and \u03c1 0 modes, the uncertainty is calculated for the width scale factor (and offset) of the signal M (D 0 ) PDF and \u03c0 0 -type background varied simultaneously. All these quadratically summed uncertainties are listed as 'Fit parametrization' in Table II. The values of the fixed yields of some backgrounds in the \u03c1 0 and K * 0 mode are varied according to the uncertainties of the respective branching fractions [22]. For the category with the FSR photon, a 20% variation is used [33]. As the branching fractions contributing to the 'other-D 0 ' background in the K * 0 mode are unknown, we apply the largest variation from among other categories. The quadratically summed uncertainty is listed as 'Background normalization' in Table II. For the normalization modes, the procedure is repeated with shifted sidebands, starting from \u00b125 MeV/c 2 from the nominal m(D 0 ) value. The statistical error from sideband subtraction is taken into account. Since possible differences in the signal shape between simulation and data could also affect the signal yield, a similar procedure as for the calibration of the \u03c0 0 background is performed. A systematic uncertainty is assigned for the case when the MC shape is smeared by a Gaussian of width 1.6 MeV/c 2 . All uncertainties arising from normalization modes are summed in quadrature and listed as 'Normalization mode' in Table II. Finally, an uncertainty is assigned by varying the nominal values of the branching fractions and A CP of the normalization modes and vector meson sub-decay modes by their respective uncertainties.We have conducted a measurement of the branching fraction and A CP in three radiative charm decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3, \u03c6\u03b3, and K * 0 \u03b3 using the full dataset recorded by the Belle experiment. We report the first observation of D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 with a significance of 5.5\u03c3, including systematic uncertainties. The significance is calculated as \u22122 ln(L 0 /L max ), where L 0 is the likelihood value with the signal yield fixed to zero and L max is that of the nominal fit. The systematic uncertainties are in-",

The first uncertainty is statistical and the 463 second systematic. Using world-average values for the 464 normalization modes [22], we obtain 465 B D 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 = (1.77 \u00b1 0.30 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , B D 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 = (2.76 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , B D 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 = (4.66 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . For the \u03c1 0 mode, the obtained value is considerably larger 466 than theoretical expectations [34, 35]. The result of the 467 \u03c6 mode is improved compared to the previous determi-468 nations by Belle and BABAR, and is consistent with the 469 world average value [22]. Our branching fraction of the 470 K * 0 mode is 3.3\u03c3 above the BABAR measurement [12]. 471 Both \u03c6 and K * 0 results agree with the latest theoretical 472 calculations [10].",
