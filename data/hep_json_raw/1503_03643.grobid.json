The Standard Model spinparity J C P = 0 ++ hypothesis is compared with alternative hypotheses for both spin and CP. The case where the observed resonance is a mixture of the Standard-Model-like Higgs boson and CP-even (J C P = 0 ++ ) or CP-odd (J C P = 0 +\u2212 ) Higgs boson in scenarios beyond the Standard Model is also studied. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model prediction and limits are placed on alternative spin and CP hypotheses, including CP mixing in different scenarios.",

Determining the spin of the newly discovered resonance and its properties under charge-parity (CP) conjugation is of primary importance to firmly establish its nature, and in particular whether it is the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson or not. Compared to the previous ATLAS publication [3], this paper contains significant updates and improvements: the SM Higgs-boson hypothesis is compared with improved spin-2 scenarios. The case where the observed resonance 1 has J P = 1 + or 1 \u2212 is not studied in this paper as it is already excluded by previous publications both by the ATLAS [3] and CMS collaborations [4].",

The effective field theory (EFT) approach is adopted in this paper, within the Higgs characterisation model [8] implemented in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [5] generator. Different hypotheses for the Higgs-boson spin and parity are studied. Three main categories can be distinguished: the hypothesis that the observed resonance is a spin-2 resonance, a pure CP-even or CP-odd BSM Higgs boson, or a mixture of an SM Higgs and CP-even or CP-odd BSM Higgs bosons. The latter case would imply CP violation in the Higgs sector. In all cases, only the Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV is considered. In case of CP mixing, the Higgs boson would be a mass eigenstate, but not a CP eigenstate. The approach used by this model relies on an EFT, which by definition is only valid up to a certain energy scale . This Higgs characterisation model considers that the resonance structure recently observed corresponds to one new boson with J P = 0 \u00b1 , 1 \u00b1 or 2 + and with mass of 125 GeV, assuming that any other BSM particle exists at an energy scale larger than . The EFT approach has the advantage of being easily and systematically improvable by adding higherdimensional operators in the Lagrangian, which effectively corresponds to adding higher-order corrections, following the same approach as that used in perturbation theory. The cutoff scale is set to 1 TeV in this paper, to account for the experimental results from the LHC and previous collider experiments that show no evidence of new physics at lower energy scales. More details can be found in Ref. [8]. In the EFT approach adopted, the Higgs-boson couplings to particles other than W bosons are ignored as they would impact the signal yield with no effects on the H \u2192 W W * decay kinematics, which is not studied in this analysis.",

As discussed in the following, these calculations have an important impact on the Higgs-boson transverse momentum p H T distribution, compared to the studies already performed using a Monte Carlo (MC) generator at leading order [6,7]. In fact, when \u03ba q is not equal to \u03ba g (non-universal couplings), due to order\u03b1 3 S terms, a tail in the p H T spectrum appears. For leading-order (LO) effects, the qq and ggF production processes are completely independent, but the beyond-LO processes contain diagrams with extra partons that give rise to a term proportional to (\u03ba q \u2212 \u03ba g ) 2 , which grows with the centre-of-mass energy squared of the hard process (s) as s 3 /(m 4 2 ) (where m is the mass of the spin-2 particle), and leads to a large tail at high values of p H T . The distributions of some spin-sensitive observables are affected by this tail. For a more detailed discussion, see Ref. [8]. This feature appears in final states with at least one jet, which indeed signals the presence of effects beyond leading order. Therefore, the 1-jet category is analysed in addition to the 0-jet category in this paper, in order to increase the sensitivity for these production modes. Figure 1 shows the p H T distribution for the 0-and 1-jet final states at generator level after basic selection requirements (the minimum p T required for the jets used for this study is 25 GeV). Three different signal hypotheses are shown: one corresponding to universal couplings, \u03ba g = \u03ba q , and two examples of non-universal couplings. The tail at high values of p H T is clearly visible in the 1-jet category for the cases of non-universal couplings.",

On the other hand, the lowest possible value up to which the EFT is valid by construction is the mass of the resonance itself; therefore it is important to study the effect of a threshold on p H T at 125 GeV.",

[39,40] and [41] for the s-channel, t-channel, and W t processes, respectively. The W W background and the dominant backgrounds involving top-quark production (tt and W t) are modelled using the Powheg + Pythia6 event generator [42][43][44][45]. For W W , WZ, and Z Z production via non-resonant vector boson scattering, the Sherpa generator provides the LO cross-section and is used for event modelling. The negligible vector-boson-scattering (VBS) Z Z process is not shown in Table 1 but is included in the background modelling for completeness. The process W \u03b3 * is defined as associ-ated W +Z /\u03b3 * production, containing an opposite-charge same-flavour lepton pair with invariant mass m less than 7 GeV. This process is modelled using Sherpa with up to one additional parton. The range m > 7 GeV is simulated with Powheg + Pythia8 and normalised to the Powheg cross-section. The use of Sherpa for W \u03b3 * is due to the inability of Powheg + Pythia8 to model invariant masses down to the production threshold. The Sherpa sample requires two leptons with p T > 5 GeV and | \u03b7 | < 3. The jet multiplicity is corrected using a Sherpa sample generated with 0.5 < m < 7 GeV and up to two additional partons, while the total cross-section is corrected using the ratio of the MCFM NLO to Sherpa LO calculations in the same restricted mass range. A similar procedure is used to model Z \u03b3 * , defined as Z /\u03b3 * pair production with one sameflavour opposite-charge lepton pair having m \u2264 4 GeV and the other having m > 4 GeV.",

The selection criteria and the analysis methodology used for the spin/CP studies described here are different however, since they are motivated not only by the need to distinguish the background processes from the Higgs-boson signal, but also by the requirement to optimise the separation power between different signal hypotheses.

Only some of the kinematic properties allow resonant and non-resonant production to be distinguished. The W W background is normalised using a control region which differs from the signal region in having a different range of dilepton invariant mass, m . The leptons from non-resonant W W production tend to have a larger opening angle than the resonant W W production. Furthermore, the Higgs-boson mass is lower than the mass of the system formed by the two W bosons. Thus, the nonresonant W W background is dominant at high m values. The 0-jet W W control region is defined after applying the p T criterion by changing the m requirement to 80 < m < 150 GeV. The 1-jet W W control region is defined after the m T criterion by requiring m > 80 GeV. The purity of the W W control region is expected to be 69 % in the 0jet category and 43 % in the 1-jet category. Thus, the dataderived normalisation of the main non-W W backgrounds, the top-quark and Drell-Yan backgrounds, is applied in the W W CR as described in the following two subsections. Other small backgrounds are normalised using MC simulation. The CR normalisation is applied to the combined W W estimate independently of the production (qq, qg or gg) process.

At each split, the algorithm finds the variable and the optimal selection cut on this variable, that give the best separation between signal and background. Finally, an overall output weight (BDT output) is assigned to each event: the larger the weight, the more signal-like the event is classified to be. More details can be found in Ref.

The latter is calculated as the negative vector sum of the momentum of objects selected according to the ATLAS identification algorithms, such as leptons, photons, and jets, and of the remaining soft objects (referred to as soft terms in the following) that typically have low values of p T [9]. The various systematic contributions taken into account in the analysis are listed in Table 6. More information on the experimental systematic uncertainties can be found in Ref. [9]. In the likelihood fit, the experimental uncertainties are varied in a correlated way across all backgrounds and across signal and control regions, so that the uncertainties on the extrapolation factors \u03b1 described in Sect. 5 are correctly propagated. All sources in Table 6 are analysed to evaluate their impact on both the yield normalisation and on the shape of the BDT discriminant distributions. Shape uncertainties are ignored if they are smaller than 5 % (smaller than the statistical uncertainty) in each bin of the distributions under study. Normalisation uncertainties are ignored as well if they are below 0.1 %.",
