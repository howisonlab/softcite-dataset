Decays of the ST particles (quarks and leptons), which are rare due to some symmetry of the theory, have played an important role in the formalism of the ST. These rare decays have been powerful tools to search for new particle interactions with the ST particles, which may not necessarily have the same symmetries. In this article, I will describe the indirect search for evidence of new physics (NP) using quark and lepton flavour changing neutral decays, which are highly suppressed within the ST, and constitute strong probes of potential new flavour structures.",

When a decade before it had been proposed 2 and then experimentally verified 3 that parity (P) was not conserved in weak decays, nobody imagined that this was also the case for the combination of charge conjugation (C) and P symmetries. It was known by then that flavour was not conserved in weak interactions, and indeed the neutral K 0 could mix with its anti-particle 4 . However, if CP was fully conserved, one should be able to define two states (K 1 0 and K 2 0 ) that are \"eigenstates\" of both the weak and CP operators.",

The weak coupling did not seem to be universal: the observed decay probability of the semileptonic \u03c0 + \u2192\u00b5 + \u03bd decay, after correcting for the different phase space, was about 20 times larger than the very similar K + \u2192\u00b5 + \u03bd decay. In 1963 Cabibbo 5 explained these observations by introducing the \"Cabibbo angle\" (\u03b8 c ), such that the weak bosons couple to a linear combination of the \"d\" and \"s\" quarks (using the modern language as in 1963 quarks had not yet been proposed). The suppression of the semileptonic K + decay with respect to the \u03c0 + decay arises from the square of the ratio of the linear coefficients, (sin\u03b8 c /cos\u03b8 c ) 2 , in the decay amplitudes. One would then expect large flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) in the equivalent case of leptonic K 0 decays. However, experimentally the probability of the process K 2 0 \u2192\u00b5 + \u00b5was measured to be ~7x10 -9 , a very rare decay indeed.",

For instance, within the ST, the interactions between photons and leptons, and between quarks and gluons, are governed by gauge theories (QED and QCD) with nonbroken gauge symmetries. The decoupling theorem 11 implies that contributions of heavy particles (with masses much larger than the momentum transfer of the process) are irrelevant. This is the reason, for instance, that to a good approximation one does not need to know the values of the top quark and the Higgs boson masses to calculate the value of the running QED coupling constant up to the Z mass. On the other hand, within the ST the weak interactions are described by a gauge theory with broken symmetry. Therefore, higher order corrections are sensitive to the size of the squared mass difference within an isospin doublet (which is a measure of how badly the isospin symmetry is broken). This is the reason why the dominant effect from weak loop corrections within the ST is proportional to (m 2 top \u2212 m 2 b ).",

Within the ST neutrinos are massless and the lepton Yukawa matrices can be diagonalized independently. Therefore, there are not FCNC in lepton decays and lepton flavour is conserved. However, the discovery that different neutrino flavours can mix, and therefore that neutrinos have non-zero masses cannot be explained by the ST. Depending on what is the mechanism to generate neutrino masses and therefore what is their nature (Majorana or Dirac) one can expect different levels of charged LFV decays. Searches for LFV decays are therefore extremely interesting, not only as evidence for NP, but as critical data to constrain the mass generation mechanism in the lepton sector, which may or may not be related to the ST Higgs mechanism.",

This is because the ST suppression factors are bigger in the Kaon sector, since the u and c-quark contributions to FCNC processes are very strongly suppressed by the GIM mechanism, while that of the t-quark is strongly suppressed by the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements. Progress in this area is limited by theoretical uncertainties affecting, in particular, the ST prediction of \u03b5'. The situation is better when the process occurs through an \"electroweak penguin\" with a charged lepton pair in the final state. However, there is still a limitation due to long distance contributions via one or two photon conversions. That's the reason why there is great interest in decays with a neutrino pair in the final state. The K + \u2192\u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd and K L 0 \u2192\u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decays are determined by short distance physics. There is a single operator that determines the decay rates within the ST and in most NP scenarios. In Figure 2 one can see the leading ST Feynman diagrams that contribute to these processes.",

The CERN SPS provides 10 12 400 GeV protons on target per second, which produces a very high intensity K beam, resulting in 5 million K decays per second in a 60m long vacuum chamber. The sample available to the NA62 experimenters corresponds to ~4.5\u00d710 12 K decays whose flight path is in their acceptance per year (~10 7 sec). They expect to see ~45 ST signal candidates per year with <10 background events. The key for the experiment's success is the background rejection and the uncertainty in the background estimation. The background rejection requires a precise measurement of the incoming K (achieved with a silicon pixel tracker operating at the secondary beam rate of 750 MHz, so-called Gigatracker) and a precise measurement of the outgoing \u03c0 + as well as a very efficient \u03c0 0 veto.

            "text": "The search for FCNC in charged lepton decays has been unsuccessful so far 28 , as can be seen in Figure 8. Nevertheless, historically these limits have played a very important role. For example, by the end of the 50s it was known that BR(\u00b5\u2192e\u03b3) had to be below ~10 -5 and this was used to argue the existence of a second neutrino 29 , needed to cancel possible large loop-induced neutral currents, in analogy to the proposal of the charm quark, from the GIM mechanism described in Section 1. The status of the searches for \u00b5\u2192e\u03b3, \u00b5\u2192eee, \u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u03b3, \u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5 and \u00b5\u2192e conversions in the presence of a nucleus field as they were by the end of 2008 is shown in Figure 8. There have been significant improvements of this picture in recent years by experiments like MEG at PSI, Belle at KEKB, BaBar at SLAC and LHCb at LHC. The MEG experiment collected stopped \u00b5 + at the PSI facilities between 2009 and 2013 to search for the process \u00b5 + \u2192e + \u03b3. The experimental signature consists of a monochromatic positron and photon back-to-back in the \u00b5 + rest frame. Therefore, the experiment needs an excellent energy and tracking resolution as well as a precise measurement of the timing. The MEG collaboration has recently published 30 the results using 3.6\u00d710 14 stopped \u00b5 + collected up to 2011. The very few events seen in the expected signal region are compatible and slightly below the expected background, reaching an observed limit of BR(\u00b5 + \u2192e + \u03b3)<5.7\u00d710 -13 at 90% C.L. The expected sensitivity will improve when adding the rest of the data available, and should improve by a factor ten with the upgrade of the experiment.",

In fact, the analysis of the whole data sample collected by BaBar 31 and Belle 32 , (~500-800 fb -1 which corresponds to ~10 9 \u03c4 + \u03c4pairs) shows no evidence of LFV \u03c4 decays, and, for example, improves the limits on BR(\u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u03b3) and BR(\u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5) to a few 10 -8 . Moreover, the start of the LHC proton-proton collider and the enormous production of charm and beauty mesons, and subsequently of \u03c4 leptons from their decays, has opened a new window of opportunity increasing the \u03c4 production rate by five orders of magnitude w.r.t. SLAC and KEKB. The LHCb experiment has collected 3 fb -1 of proton-proton collisions at 7-8 TeV center-of-mass energies by the end of 2012, which correspond to ~10 11 \u03c4 leptons. The LHCb analysis 33 has less efficiency and purity than that of the e + ecolliders, but nevertheless reaches similar sensitivities for the decay \u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5. Already with this initial sample from LHCb the combined values as obtained by HFAG 34 , improve the existing limits to: BR(\u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5)<1.2\u00d710 -8 and BR(\u03c4\u2192\u00b5\u03b3)<5\u00d710 -8 at 90% C.L. Improvements in the forthcoming decade are expected from the upgrade of MEG and Belle experiments and from the data accumulated at the LHC and the upgrade of the LHC experiments. Moreover new experiments are being built at J-PARC (COMET) 35 and the Fermilab booster (Mu2e) 36 which plan to use very large samples of \u00b5 (~10 10 per second) to search for \u00b5\u2192e conversions in the presence of a nucleus field. They both expect to reach sensitivities below 10 -16 on these processes, i.e. a four order of magnitude improvement. It is clear that Figure 8 will look very different in ten years from now.",

Because of these symmetries some processes are highly suppressed in the ST, but may receive important NP contributions if these symmetries are not respected by the theory that should supersede the ST. Flavour is one of these properties of the ST that cannot be explained by fundamental symmetries: why do we have three almost identical replicas of quarks and leptons, and what is the origin of their different masses? This new theory of flavour should be able to answer these questions, and naturally should include new flavour transitions. This is the reason why this chapter has been devoted to describe a few of the most interesting attempts to look for FCNC in quark and lepton decays. The field is very active today, and running experiments together with new experiments scheduled to start taking data in the next decade will provide new hope for a deeper understanding of nature.",
