For all the measurements at least one of the reconstructed muons has a transverse momentum, p T , above 20 GeV/c and a pseudorapidity, \u03b7, between 2 and 4.5. In the case of the Z, a di-muon invariant mass between 60 GeV/c 2 and 120 GeV/c 2 is required. Theoretical predictions, calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD using recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), are found to be in agreement with the measurements.",

            "text": "Measurements of W and Z cross-sections in proton-proton collistions constitute an important test of the Standard Model. While electroweak theory can currently describe the fundamental partonic processes of electroweak boson production at the LHC at NLO with an accuracy at the percent level, a large uncertainty on the theoretical predictions arise from the present knowledge of the proton PDFs. The accuracy strongly depends on the rapidity range as shown in Fig. 1 and 2 : in kinematic regions where PDF uncertainties are low, precise measurements of electroweak bosons provide a stringent test of the Standard Model in a new energy regime; in regions where PDFs are less known, production studies can input valuable information to constrain new PDF fits. The LHCb experiment, described in more detail in [1], at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been designed to study heavy flavour physics in the forward region (1.9 < \u03b7 < 4.9). Measurements provided by LHCb can test the Standard Model and provide input a e-mail: yasmine.amhis@epfl.ch  to constrain the PDFs in both a region accessible only to LHCb (\u03b7 > 2.5) and a rapidity region which is also accessible to ATLAS and CMS (2 < \u03b7 < 2.5). The following electroweak measurements at LHCb include the analysis of the Z and W boson production at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In addition, the measurement of Z boson production in decays to pairs of \u03c4 leptons is reported. The cross-section ratios \u03c3 W /\u03c3 Z and \u03c3 + W /\u03c3 \u2212 W , and the W charge asymmetry, A W , are also presented. Further information can be found in Refs [2], [3].",

Using (240\u00b18)pb \u22121 of data collected both in 2010 and 2011, a measurement of Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 cross-section has also been made. All measurements are in agreement with NNLO QCD predictions. Most of the errors are dominated by systematic uncertainties due to the determination of various reconstruction efficiencies from data. With larger statistics these systematic uncertainties will be reduced. Using the full 2011 dataset, 1 fb \u22121 , it is expected that improved measurements will place significant constraints on the proton PDFs.",
