Electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters surrounding the tracking system with pointing-tower geometry are used to measure photon energies. At a depth approximately corresponding to the maximum development of the EM shower, the EM calorimeters contain finegrained detectors (central electromagnetic strip chambers) that measure the shower profile.

The measured cross section for diphoton production integrated over the acceptance is 12.3 \u00b1 0.2 stat \u00b1 3.5 syst pb. The predictions for the integrated cross section are 10.6 \u00b1 0.6 pb from \uf764\uf769\uf770\uf768\uf76f\uf778, 11.3 \u00b1 2.4 pb from \uf772\uf765\uf773\uf762\uf76f\uf773, 9.2 pb from \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761, 12.4 \u00b1 4.4 pb from \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761, 11.5 \u00b1 0.3 pb from \uf76d\uf763\uf766\uf76d, and 11.8 +1.7 \u22120.6 pb from the NNLO calculation. The \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 scale uncertainty is large because it also accounts for parton shower. The \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 uncertainty is unreported. All predictions are consistent with the measurement. Figure 1 shows the comparisons between the observed and predicted distributions in diphoton mass M, transverse momentum P T of the photon pair, and azimuthal separation \u2206\u03c6 between the momenta of the two photons in the event. All predictions for the mass distribution show a reasonable agreement with the data for all calculations above the maximum at 30 GeV/c 2 except the \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 \u03b3\u03b3 calculation. All predictions underestimate the data rate around and below the maximum. In the P T spectrum, the \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761, \uf764\uf769\uf770\uf768\uf76f\uf778, \uf772\uf765\uf773\uf762\uf76f\uf773 and \uf76d\uf763\uf766\uf76d predictions underestimate the data in the region between 30 and 60 GeV/c, where the contribution from quark fragmentation is important. Both NNLO and \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 predictions describe the data fairly well in this region. For P T < 20 GeV/c, where soft-gluon radiation becomes important, the \uf772\uf765\uf773\uf762\uf76f\uf773, \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 and \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 predictions provide a good description of the data because of the resummation of multiple soft-gluon emission amplitudes through either analytical calculation or parton showering. The fixed-order predictions diverge in the limit of vanishing P T . The \uf772\uf765\uf773\uf762\uf76f\uf773, \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 and \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 predictions show a good agreement with the data at larger \u2206\u03c6, where the diphoton system acquires substantial transverse momentum due to multiple soft-gluon emission. The NNLO calculation is the only prediction consistent with the data in the low \u2206\u03c6 tail, which contains photon pairs with very low mass and relatively high P T .",

            "text": "The cross section for direct photon production in association with a heavy quark in hadronic collisions provides valuable information on the probability distributions of partons inside the initial-state hadrons. At photon transverse energy E \u03b3 T smaller than 100 GeV, such events are produced predominantly by the Compton scattering process, while at higher energies the dominant process is quark-antiquark annihilation with gluon (g) splitting to heavy quarks. It is conventional to assume that the charm (c) and bottom (b) quarks in the proton arise only from gluon splitting. However, there are other models that allow the existence of intrinsic heavy quarks in the proton. A cross-section measurement of \u03b3 + Q + X (X can be any final-state particle) production provides information  on the heavy-quark and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) and on the rate of final-state gluon splitting to heavy quarks. This article presents the final CDF measurements of the cross sections for photon with heavy-flavor jets, using the full data set from 9.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, exploring E \u03b3 T up to 300 GeV. The photo-plus-heavy-jet events are selected online by requiring at least one energy cluster consistent with a photon in the final state. The offline event selection required each event to have at least one photon candidate that has pseudorapidity in the fiducial region of the central calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1). Photon candidates are required to have E \u03b3 T > 30 GeV. An artifical neural network (ANN) is constructed to reduce background. At least one jet must be present in each event. Jets are reconstructed using the JETCLU algorithm with a cone radius 0.4. We select jets that have E T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.5. At least one jet is required to be classified as a heavy-flavor jet using a secondary-vertex tagger. The selected jet is required to be reconstructed in a volume outside a cone with a radius in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space of 0.4 surrounding the photon candidate.",

The average cross section in a bin is determined by dividing the yield by the product of the trigger efficiency, the selection efficiency and acceptance, the integrated luminosity, and the bin size. The experimental results are compared with four theoretical calculations: (i) the fixed NLO calculations, including direct photon production subprocesses and subprocesses where the photon is emitted from parton fragmentation, both at O(\u03b1\u03b1 2 s ), (ii) the k Tfactorization calculations, including O(\u03b1\u03b1 2 s ) off-shell amplitudes of gluon-gluon fusion and quark-(anti)quark interaction subprocesses, and the k T -dependent (i.e., unintegrated) parton distributions, where k T denotes the transverse momentum of the parton, (iii) the \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 calculations, including all the tree-level matrix-element diagrams with one photon and up to three jets, with at least one b jet or c jet in the explored kinematic region, (iv) the \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 calculations, including the 2 \u2192 2 matrix-element subprocesses gb \u2192 \u03b3b and qq \u2192 \u03b3g with g \u2192 bb and g \u2192 cc splittings in the parton shower. Previous studies [5] showed that the contribution of gluon splitting to heavy flavor has to be approximately doubled over expectations from the leading-order \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 generator to reproduce the data. Hence, we also show predictions that include a double gluon-splitting rate to heavy flavors. Figure 4 shows the comparisons between the observed and predicted distributions in photon E T . The NLO pQCD predictions agree with data at low E \u03b3 T but fail to describe data for E \u03b3 T > 70 GeV for the bottom-jet cross section. The same trend is observed in the charm-jet cross section even though the experimental uncertainty is larger. For large E \u03b3 T , the dominant production process yielding a photon and a heavy quark involves a final-state gluon splitting into a heavy-flavor pair. This process is present only at leading order in the NLO calculation. The \uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772\uf770\uf761 prediction allows up to three partons in the final state, through the inclusion of additional tree-level amplitudes. The additional amplitudes also serve as a source of heavy-flavor pairs (through gluon splitting), which is important for the high E \u03b3",
