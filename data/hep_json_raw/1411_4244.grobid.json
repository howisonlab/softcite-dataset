These functions can be investigated through experimental observables such as hadron multiplicities in the collinear and transverse framework, the dihadron multiplicities, the azimuthal asymmetries and some others. New results on these observables by the COMPASS experiment at CERN will be shown and discussed.",

The transverse momentum structure of the nucleon, however, was not considered with the same level of priority although it is poorly known. Recently, a considerable effort is being dedicated to achieve a good level of understanding of the internal 3\u2212D partonic structure of the nucleon. Thus a growing interest in the determination of the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and Fragmentation Functions (FFs) is taking place.",

In the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD) at leading twist, SIDIS is viewed as the hard scattering of a lepton off a quark or antiquark, which subsequently hadronizes into final state hadrons. The hard-scattering cross section is calculable in pQCD while the PDFs and FFs are non perturbative quantities. In the collinear framework, i.e. integrated over transverse momentum, they are believed to be universal, i.e, process-independent. In this case, PDFs are know with a high precision while FFs are know for pions and poorly known for kaons. With the inclusion of the kinematic dependence on the hadron transverse momentum, beyond the standard collinear factorisation is reached and the transverse momentum dependence of PDFs and FFs is assessed. While the TMD-PDFs parametrize the flavour transverse momentum structure of the nucleon and a e-mail: nour.makke@cern.ch encode details about the motion of quarks inside a nucleon due to their intrinsic transverse momentum (referred to as k \u22a5 ), the TMD-FFs encode details about producing a final-state hadron with a component of hadron momentum transverse with respect to the momentum transfer (referred to as p h\u22a5 ) different from zero.",

SIDIS measurements profit from the different probabilities to produce a hadron of certain specie from a parton of a given flavour and have been successfully performed at fixed-target experiments for k \u22a5 & p \u22a5 integrated observables.",

As seen in eq.5, the cross section exhibit a cos \u03c6 h and a cos 2\u03c6 h azimuthal modulations. They are generated by the so called Cahn effect [5], which arises from the fact that the kinematics is non collinear when the k \u22a5 is taken into account (i.e. a kinematical higher twist), and with the perturbative gluon radiation, resulting in order \u03b1 s QCD processes. pQCD effects are becoming important for high transverse momenta of the produced hadrons, while they are small for p T up to 1 GeV/c. For the extraction of unpolarised asymmetries the usual tricks to cancel the experimental acceptance are not applicable and a full acceptance correction is needed in order to extract the amplitude of the azimuthal modulations. On top of the Cahn effect come the particularly interesting so called Boer-Mulders function, describing the transverse parton polarisation inside an unpolarised hadron and generating azimuthal asymmetries in this part of the SIDIS cross section. It is a T-odd function and describes the correlation between the quark transverse spin and its transverse momentum in an unpolarised nucleon [6].

The A UU cos 2\u03c6 h is found to be significantly positive for both charges with a larger absolute values for negative hadrons. It also shows a strong kinematic dependence. While it shows a descending trend versus x B , it decreases versus z and p h T up to z 0.6 and p h T 0.4 GeV/c. First theoretical attempts to describe the observed strong kinematic dependencies in terms of Cahn and Boer-Mulders effects could not reproduce the trends suggested by experimental results in particular the p h T dependence.   in bins of z and p h T , in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively, where the error bars represents statistical uncertainties. It has been checked that projecting the asymmetries on any of the three kinematic variables reproduce the results for the integrated asymmetries, as expected. For A LU sin \u03d5 h , no specific effect could be observed due to large statistical errors and the results are not shown here. The large negative signal of A UU cos \u03c6 h at small x is originated by high z and small p h T hadrons, i.e. 0.55 < z < 0.8 and 0.1 GeV/c < p h T < 0.64 GeV/c. In addition, the absolute values of A UU cos \u03d5 increases with p h T for z < 0.55. For A UU cos 2\u03d5 h asymmetry, its large positively increasing signal versus x B is originated by high z and small p h T hadrons, i,e, 0.55 < z < 0.85 and 0.1 GeV/c < p h T < 0.5 GeV/c. For p h T > 0.5 GeV/c, the asymmetry shows a linear x B dependence. The difference between positive and negative hadron charges is mainly seen at large p h T (0.64 GeV/c < p h T < 1 GeV/c). To summarise, the experimental data shows different trends in the various regions in (z,p h T ) suggesting that there are dif-ferent regimes with different dominant processes. Thus, a new phenomenological approach taking into account these observations is needed for a better description of the experimental data and a deeper understanding of the physics behind.",

The first are the p 2 T -dependent hadron multiplicities measured using data collected in 2006 by scattering a 160 GeV muon beam off a deuteron ( 6 Lid) target. Yet, only part of the total set is shown in three (x B ,Q 2 ) kinematic bins and 2 z ranges. However the total set covers a wide kinematic domain in x B down to 0.003 and Q 2 up to 30 (GeV/c) 2 and covers a p 2 T range up to 3 (GeV/c) 2 . The experimental data clearly need 2-exponentials function to produce their shape. The second input are the azimuthal asymmetries measured using 2004 data. Two sets of results are produced, the first by binning the data in x B ,z and p h T integrating over the other two variables and the second in a threedimensional grid of the three variables. The asymmetries of the cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03d5 h modulations show strong kinematic dependencies which could not be reproduced by the existing phenomenological approach. These results constitute an important input to improve the understanding of the transverse momentum structure of the nucleon.",
