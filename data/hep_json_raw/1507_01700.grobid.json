This method relies on accurate knowledge of the \u03c4 production vertex and precise measurement of its decay products. The method makes no assumptions about the \u03c4 kinematics, and is insensitive to momentum loss along the beam direction. We demonstrate the method using e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events fully simulated in the ILD detector.",

A new generation of high energy particle colliders [1,2,3,4] is presently under study. A key scientific aim of these facilities is to measure the Higgs boson's properties with great precision, important aspects of which involve measurements of the \u03c4 final state. An example is the use of measurements of the \u03c4 spin state to probe the CP nature of the Higgs boson. The detectors being designed for use at these accelerators will be equipped with vertex detectors providing unprecedented impact parameter resolution (see e.g. [5]), giving rise to intriguing possibilities in the reconstruction of relatively long-lived states such as the \u03c4 lepton.",

The \u03c4 -pair rest-frame can be assumed to be the centre-of-mass of the colliding beams (in the case of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process), or the frame recoiling against particles produced in conjunction with the \u03c4 pair, as in the case e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 .

Another approach is to combined the measured momenta of visible \u03c4 decay products with constraints on the \u03c4 mass and global event transverse momentum balance, resulting in an under-constrained system. The likelihood of the various \u03c4 decay topologies allowed by the constraints can then be used to choose a best solution, or alternatively to associate a weight to each solution e.g. [9,10,11].",

We consider the class of events in which one or more single-\u03bd decaying \u03c4 leptons have been produced in conjunction with zero or more wellmeasured particles, together with zero or more particles escaping along the beam-line (e.g. ISR photons). Examples of such processes at an electron-positron collider are twofermion production e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , Higgs-strahlung e + e \u2212 \u2192 HZ \u2192 (\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), and its major irreducible background e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 (\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). In such events, the overall p T of the \u03c4 s and other visible particles is balanced, while there may be non-zero net momentum along the beam-line due to ISR. A natural way in which to determine the \u03c8 angles in an event (one per \u03c4 decay) is to choose that combination which minimises the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum (p miss T ) in the event. This method has the advantage of making no assumptions about \u03c4 kinematics or about undetected particles escaping along the beam-line -also indispensable for application at hadron collider experiments, but does require that no additional neutrinos are produced in the same event. In the case of several solutions for which p miss T is consistent with zero, the reconstructed \u03c4 lifetimes can be used to determine the most likely one, or each solution could be weighted by a likelihood based on its lifetime and/or \u03c4 decay kinematics.",

This inefficiency is due to cases in which the reconstructed visible mass is larger than the \u03c4 mass, or in which no solution with positive decay length is found. In fig. 4 we show the distribution of the chosen solutions' p miss T , for events in which both \u03c4 s were forced to decay to either \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd or \u03c1\u03bd. A rather good minimum (p miss T < 1 MeV) is found in the large majority of cases, but a fraction of events have a larger p miss T . These events with large p miss T are due to mis-reconstruction of the event, and make up a larger fraction of \u03c1\u03bd than \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd decays due to the relatively worse precision of the calorimeters compared to the tracker. Events in which the reconstructed p miss T is larger than around 0.5 GeV/c show a significantly wider peak in the \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 mass distribution, as shown in fig. 4. The mass distribution in the case of \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd (\u03c1\u03bd) decays has a central peak with a Gaussian width \u03c3 \u223c 0.6 GeV (1.1 GeV), and non-Gaussian tails to both higher and lower values.

In the \"vertex\" method, the reconstructed vertex position is directly used to constrain the \u03c4 direction, and the \u03c4 mass constraint used to find two possible solutions for the neutrino momentum. No real solution is found in around a quarter of \u03c4 decays. The event p miss T is used to choose the best solution. In the \"decay plane\" method, the central position and major axis of the vertex position error ellipsoid are used to define the \u03c4 decay plane, which is then used in the same way as for single prong decays. Candidate \u03c4 solutions are required to have fitted and reconstructed \u03c4 decay vertices in the same hemisphere. The event candidate solution with smallest p miss T is selected. When using this method, no good candidate solution was identified in around 4.5% of events. Figure 6 shows a comparison of these two multiprong methods. As well as having a much higher efficiency for identifying a solution, the \"decay plane\" approach results in significantly better mass resolution. The di-\u03c4 invariant mass distribution for multiprong a 1 decays obtained by using the \"decay plane\" method are compared to other decay channels in fig. 5, showing that multiprong decays are reconstructed with a similar precision as \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd decays.",

In contrast to other methods, no assumptions are made on the centre-of-mass frame or the invariant mass of a \u03c4 -pair system, nor on the \u03c4 energies.
