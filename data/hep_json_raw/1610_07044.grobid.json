            "text": "The cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hc at center-of-mass energies from 3.896 to 4.600 GeV are measured using data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The cross sections are found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S), but the line shape is inconsistent with the Y states observed in the latter two modes. Two structures are observed in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 hc cross sections around 4.22 and 4.39 GeV/c 2 , which we call Y (4220) and Y (4390), respectively. A fit with a coherent sum of two Breit-Wigner functions results in a mass of (4218.4 +5.5 \u22124.5 \u00b1 0.9) MeV/c 2 and a width of (66.0 +12.3 \u22128.3 \u00b1 0.4) MeV for the Y (4220), and a mass of (4391. In the last decade, a series of charmonium-like states have been observed at e + e \u2212 colliders. These states challenge the understanding of charmonium spectroscopy as well as QCD calculations [1,2]. According to potential models, there are five vector charmonium states between the 1D state \u03c8(3770) and 4.7 GeV/c 2 , namely the 3S, 2D, 4S, 3D, and 5S states [1]. From experimental studies, besides the three well established structures observed in the inclusive hadronic cross section [3], i.e., \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415), five Y states, i.e., Y (4008), Y (4230), Y (4260), Y (4360), and Y (4660) have been reported in initial state radiation (ISR) processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 or e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S) at the B-factories [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] or in the direct production processes at the CLEO and BESIII experiments [12,13] The overpopulation of structures in this region and the mismatch of the properties between the potential model prediction and experimental measurements make them good candidates for exotic states. Various scenarios have been proposed, which interpret one or some of them as hybrid states, tetraquark states, or molecular states [14].",

The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c was first studied by CLEO [15] at center-of-mass (CM) energies \u221a s from 4.000 to 4.260 GeV. A 10\u03c3 signal at 4.170 GeV and a hint of a rising cross section at 4.260 GeV were observed. Using data sam-ples taken at 13 CM energies from 3.900 to 4.420 GeV [16], BESIII reported the measurement of the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [17]. Unlike the line shape of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, there is a broad structure in the high energy region with a possible local maximum at around 4.23 GeV in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c . Based on the CLEO measurement at \u221a s = 4.170 GeV and the BESIII measurement, two assumptions were made to describe the cross section in Ref. [18]. In both assumptions, a narrow structure exists at around 4.23 GeV, while the situation in the high energy region is unclear due to the lack of experimental data.",

Two resonant structures are observed at \u221a s = 4.22 and 4.39 GeV (hereafter referred to as Y (4220) and Y (4390)). The integrated luminosity at each energy point is measured with an uncertainty of 1.0% using large-angle Bhabha events [21,22]. There are 17 energy points where the integrated luminosities are larger than 40 pb \u22121 (referred to as 'XY Z data sample' hereafter), while the integrated luminosities for the other energy points are smaller than 20 pb \u22121 (referred to as 'R-scan data sample' hereafter). The CM energies for the XY Z data sample are measured with e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR/FSR \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events with an uncertainty of \u00b10.8 MeV [23], which is dominated by the systematic uncertainty.

For the XY Z data sample, the \u03b3\u03b7 c mass spectrum is fitted with the MC simulated signal shape convolved with a Gaussian function to reflect the mass resolution difference between the data and MC simulation, together with a linear background. The fit to the data sample at \u221a s = 4.416 GeV is shown in Fig. 1. The tail on the high mass side is due to events with ISR (ISR photon undetected); this is simulated with KKMC in MC, and its fraction is fixed in the fit. For the data samples with large statistics ( \u221a s = 4.226, 4.258, 4.358, and 4.416 GeV), the fit is applied to the 16 \u03b7 c decay modes simultaneously with the number of signal events in each decay mode constrained by the corresponding branching fraction [27]. For the data samples at the other energy points, we fit the mass spectrum summed over all \u03b7 c decay modes. For the R-scan data sample, the number of signal events is calculated by counting the entries in the h c signal region [3.515, 3.535] GeV/c 2 (n sig ) and the entries in the h c sideband regions [3.475, 3.495] GeV/c 2 and [3.555, 3.575] GeV/c 2 (n side ) using the formula n obs hc = n sig \u2212f \u2022n side . Here, the scale factor f = 0.5 is the ratio of the size of the signal region and the background region, and the background is assumed to be distributed linearly in the region of interest.

When producing MC events for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c process through the intermediate states Z c (3900) or Z c (4020), the parameters of the Z c (3900) and Z c (4020) are fixed to the average values from the published measurements [11,17,[31][32][33].

Only the statistical uncertainty is considered in the fit. There are two solutions from the fit, one of them is shown in Fig. 2. The second solution is very close to the one shown here. This can been proved analytically using Eq.(9) in Ref. [34], which relates the two solutions from the fit when a sum of two coherent Breit-Wigner functions is used. The parameters determined from the fit are M 1 = (4218.4 +5.5 \u22120.9 ) rad. The correlation matrix of the fit parameters shows large correlation between the (\u0393 ee B) j and \u03c6 (see supplemental material [19]). The likelihood contours in the mass and width planes for Y (4220) and Y (4390) are shown in Fig. 3, together with the positions of Y (4230), Y (4260), Y (4360), and \u03c8(4415) with the parameters taken from the latest PDG average [3]. The low-lying resonance from the study of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 at BESIII [35], marked as Y (4260) BESIII in the plot, is also compared. Y (4260), Y (4360), and \u03c8(4415) are located out-side the 3\u03c3 contours, while Y (4230) and Y (4260) BESIII are overlapped with the 3\u03c3 contour of Y (4220). We also fit the cross section with the coherent sum of three Breit-Wigner functions, or the coherent sum of two Breit-Wigner functions and a phase space term. Both assumptions improve the fit quality, but the significances of the third resonance and the phase space term are only 2.6\u03c3 and 2.9\u03c3, respectively.",

The uncertainty from the CM energy measurement includes the uncertainty of the CM energy and the assumption made in the measurement for R-scan data sample. Due to the low statistics at each energy point in the Rscan data sample, we approximate the difference between the requested and the actual CM energy by a common constant. To assess the systematic uncertainty connected with this assumption, we replace the constant by a CM energy-dependent second-order polynomial. The systematic uncertainty of the CM energy is common for all the energy points in the two data samples and will propagate to the mass measurement (0.8 MeV). The changes on the parameters are taken as uncertainty. The uncertainty from CM energy spread is estimated by convoluting the fit formula with a Gaussian function with a width of 1.6 MeV, which is beam spread, measured by the Beam Energy Measurement System [36]. The uncertainty from the cross section measurement is divided into two parts.",
