The existence of a light dark-force mediator has been hypothesized as a possible explanation for several unexplained physical phenomena. A new search for this mediator, the dark photon U, is underway using data collected with the KLOE detector at DA\u03a6NE. We describe the strategy we will use in our search for a resonant peak in the electron-positron invariant mass spectrum from the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3 with U \u2192 e + e \u2212 . So far we found no evidence for the process and set a preliminary upper limit on the level of mixing between the secluded dark sector and the standard model.",

In particular we would like to probe the range 15 < m U < 50 MeV/c 2 to either find evidence for an explanation of the muon anomaly or completely exclude the dark photon as a possible explanation. At an e + e \u2212 collider like DA\u03a6NE, it's possible that the electron and positron can annihilate, or scatter, producing a U boson and a photon, with the decay of the U boson into a pair of leptons.

A new KLOE-2 analysis is underway which proposes to search for U boson production in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3, U \u2192 e + e \u2212 . The 3 final-state particles of this process are the same as radiative Bhabha scattering. The distinct feature we are searching for is a Breit-Wigner resonant production peak (at the U boson mass) in the invariant-mass distribution of the e + e \u2212 pair. To search for a U boson produced at a fixed-energy e + e \u2212 collider we use initial-state radiation (ISR) to reduce the center of mass energy and thereby scan the range of possible U boson masses down to 2m e . The process consists of finite-width effects for s-channel annihilation subprocesses, non-resonant t-channel U boson exchange, and s-t interference contributions. The finite-width effects are order \u0393 U /m U on the integrated cross section so are much smaller than any potential resonance we would observe, but they are critical from a phenomonological perspective and are properly taken into account in the Monte Carlo simulation [31]. The non-resonant t-channel effects would not produce the Breit-Wigner peak in the invariant mass distribution but could, in principle, show up in analyses of angular distributions or asymmetries. The KLOE-2 analysis will focus exclusively on resonant s-channel U boson production.",

            "text": "Due to the three order-of-magnitude difference between the electron mass and the center-of-mass energy of the collision, numerical instabilities arise as q 2 approaches threshold where the square root gives 0, but as q 2 becomes larger than 4m 2 the factor 1/q 2 becomes dominant. These problems are apparent when the simulated cross section fails to show the significant rise at threshold. Together with the authors of Babayaga we modified the Babayaga-NLO [26][27][28][29][30][31] event generator and implemented it into our full KLOE simulation such that the weighted events are distributed throughout the phase space with the square of the matrix element providing the correct weight. The good agreement between our MC simulation using the new event generator and our selected data sample is shown in Fig. 1.",

After a preliminary excercise, we found no evidence for the existence of a U boson and set a preliminary upper limit at 10 \u22125 -10 \u22127 on the level of kinetic mixing with the Standard Model as a function of the U boson mass in the range 10-520 MeV/c 2 . A final result is forthcoming and should extend the limit closer to the dielectron mass threshold. The upgraded KLOE-2 experiment [42], currently running, uses a new cylindrical GEM inner tracker [43] providing higher resolution interaction vertexing, and plans to collect upwards of 10 fb \u22121 of data. The increased statistical power and tracking/vertexing sensitivity will allow KLOE-2 to significantly extend our present limits.",
