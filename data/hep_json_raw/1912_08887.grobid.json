            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is an attractive extension of the standard model (SM), characterized by the presence of SUSY partners for every SM particle. These partner particles have the same quantum numbers as their SM counterparts, except for the spin, which differs by one-half unit. In models with R-parity conservation [9], the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, and, if neutral, could be a dark matter candidate [10]. The extended particle spectrum in SUSY scenarios allows for the cancellation of quadratic divergences arising from quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass [11][12][13][14][15]. Scenarios realizing this cancellation often contain top squarks ( t), SUSY partners of the SM top quark (t), and higgsinos, SUSY partners of the SM Higgs boson, with masses near the electroweak scale. The t pair production cross section is expected to be large compared to the electroweak production of higgsinos at CERN LHC for t masses near the electroweak scale.",

The search presented here improves the previous one [29] by adding the data collected in 2017 and 2018, resulting in approximately a factor of four increase in the size of the data sample. In addition, new search regions have been added, which are sensitive to scenarios where the mass of the top squark is close to the sum of the masses of either the \u03c7 0 1 and the top quark, or the \u03c7 0 1 and the W boson. These scenarios are referred to as compressed mass scenarios hereafter. In addition, a method has been implemented to identify top quarks that decay hadronically, and also the background estimation techniques have been improved. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 and 3 describe the CMS detector and the simulated samples used in this analysis. The object reconstruction and search strategy are presented in section 4. The background prediction methods are described in section 5, and the relevant systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 6. Results and interpretations are detailed in section 7, and a summary is presented in section 8.",

The reweighting is applied to all SUSY samples but only to 2016 SM samples. No reweighting is applied for 2017 and 2018 SM simulation because of the improved tuning of the MC generators mentioned above. The procedure is based on a comparison of the light-flavor jet multiplicity in dilepton tt events in data and simulation. The comparison is performed after selecting events with two leptons and two b-tagged jets, which are jets identified as originating from the fragmentation of bottom quarks. The reweighting factors obtained vary from 0.92 to 0.51 for one to six additional jets. The uncertainties in the reweighting factors are evaluated as half of the deviation from unity. These uncertainties cover the data-simulation differences observed in tt enriched validation samples obtained by selecting events with an e\u00b5 pair and at least one b-tagged jet.",

Jet energies are corrected for contributions from multiple interactions in the same or adjacent beam crossing (pileup) [82,83] and to account for nonuniformity in the detector response. These jet energy corrections are propagated to the calculation of p miss T [84,85]. Jets in the analysis are required to be within p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and the number of these jets (N j ) is required to be at least two. Jets overlapping with the selected lepton within a cone radius of \u2206R = 0.4 are not counted. The distribution of the number of jets after the preselection requirements is shown in figure 2 (upper right). The jet multiplicity is used to define the signal region bins to optimize sensitivity for a variety of signal models and SUSY particle masses, as shown in this figure.",

The network uses high-level information such as the invariant mass of the trijet system and of the individual dijet pairs, as well as kinematic information from each jet. This includes its Lorentz vector, DeepCSV heavy-flavor discriminator values, jet shape variables, and detector level particle multiplicity and energy fraction variables. The network is trained using both tt and QCD simulation, and data as training inputs. The simulation is used to define the examples of signal and background. The signal is defined as any trijet passing the preselection requirements, where each jet is matched to a generator level daughter of a top quark within a cone of \u2206R < 0.4 and the overall trijet system is matched to the generator level top quark within a cone of \u2206R < 0.6. The background category is defined as any trijet combination that is not categorized as signal. This includes trijet combinations for which some, but not all, of the jets match top decay products. The data is included in the training to inhibit the network from learning features of the MC which are not present in data. This is achieved through a technique called domain adaption via gradient reversal [88]. With this method, an additional output is added to the neural network to distinguishing between trijet candidates from QCD simulation and a QCD-enriched data sample. The main network is then restricted to JHEP05(2020)032 minimize its ability to discriminate simulation from data. This yields a network with good separation between signal and background while minimizing over-fitting on features that exist only in simulation. Before the final selection of trijets as top quarks can be made, any trijet candidates that may share the jets with another candidate must be removed. This is achieved by always favoring the candidate with a higher top discriminator value as determined by the neural network. The reconstructed candidates are identified as hadronic tops when the neural network discriminator is above the threshold corresponding to an efficiency of 45% and the mistagging rate is 10% for dileptonic tt events.",
