            "text": "Precise measurements of the mass of the W boson are important to test the overall consistency of the Standard Model of particle physics. The current best measurements of the W boson mass come from single production measurements at hadron colliders in its decay mode to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino and pair production of W bosons at lepton colliders, where both the leptonic and hadronic decay modes of the W boson have been considered. In this study, prospects for a measurement of the W boson mass in the all-jet final state at hadron colliders are presented. The feasibility of this measurement takes advantage of numerous recent developments in the field of jet substructure. Compared to other methods for measuring the W mass, a measurement in the all-jets final state would be complementary in methodology and have systematic uncertainties orthogonal to previous measurements. We have estimated the main experimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting a measurement in the all-jet final state. With new trigger strategies, a statistical uncertainty for the measurement of the mass difference between the Z and W bosons of 30 MeV could be reached with HL-LHC data corresponding to 3000 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. However, in order to reach that precision, the current understanding of non-perturbative contributions to the invariant mass of W \u2192 qq and Z \u2192 bb jets will need to be refined. Similar strategies will also allow the reach for generic boosted resonances searches in hadronic channels to be extended.",

            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM) of particle of physics, electroweak interactions are mediated by the photon and the W and Z bosons [1][2][3]. While at lowest order in electroweak theory, the mass of the W boson can be expressed solely as a function of the Z boson mass, the fine-structure constant and the Fermi constant, this statement is modified by higher order corrections, most prominently from other heavy particles in the SM [4,5] and potentially also from particles beyond the SM. Global fits to the SM parameters [6], constraining physics beyond the SM, are currently limited by the precision of the W boson mass measurement. Precise measurements of the mass of the W boson are therefore important to test the overall consistency of the SM. The current best measurements of the W boson mass come from single production measurements at hadron colliders [7][8][9][10][11][12] in its decay mode to a lepton (e or \u00b5) and a neutrino with a branching ratio of (21.34 \u00b1 0.31) % [13] and pair production of W bosons at lepton colliders [14][15][16][17], where both the leptonic decay mode and the decay mode of the W boson to a qq pair with a branching ratio of (67.41 \u00b1 0.27) % has been considered. The current world average (not yet considering LHC measurements) is (80.385 \u00b1 0.015) GeV [13].",

At hadron colliders, the W boson mass cannot be fully reconstructed in the lepton plus neutrino decay mode. Only its transverse mass can be extracted by estimating the neutrino transverse momentum from the measured missing transverse momentum in the event. The qq decay mode allows for the reconstruction of the full 4-momentum of the W boson through exclusively visible particles. The hadronic decay mode, compared to the lepton plus neutrino decay mode has the potential to avoid the experimental systematic uncertainties related to the measurement of the missing transverse momentum and theoretical uncertainties related to the transverse mass [18,19]. Additionally, the absence of missing transverse energy yields a more narrow peak that is predominantly invariant across a broad kinematic regime of W boson transverse momentum. Single production of W \u2192 qq results in a rather clean final state, compared to e.g., tt production, because the quarks originating from the W boson can form jets of hadrons without color reconnection to other quarks in the event not originating from the W boson.",

            "text": "The dominant background to the production of W \u2192 qq at hadron colliders is quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet production. This background can be significantly suppressed by requiring jets with high transverse momenta p T in the event. We therefore propose a measurement of the W \u2192 qq mass produced in association with a high momentum jet as depicted in figure 1. For such high momentum W bosons, the shower of hadrons originating from the quark anti-quark pair merges into a single large radius jet of particles. Multiple techniques have been proposed to analyze the jet substructure of such jets [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] in order to distinguish jets from W \u2192 qq and jets from multijet background. For a review of recent theory and experimental progress in jet substructure, see [28,29]. Additionally, such techniques have been shown to reduce theoretical and experimental uncertainties related to the reconstruction of the W boson mass by removing contributions from non-perturbative effects and additional pp interactions happening in the same bunch crossing, so-called pileup interactions. These techniques have been extensively validated by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [30][31][32][33] and it was successfully demonstrated that they can be used to extract the W \u2192 qq mass peak on top of the multijet background [34][35][36].",

The dominant systematic uncertainties in these searches result from JHEP02(2019)003 the selection efficiency and misidentification probability calibrations of the substructure variables used to reduce the multijet backgrounds. These uncertainties are closely correlated with equivalent issues for the W and Z bosons themselves. Further, measurements of the Higgs boson decaying to b quarks at high transverse momentum [38] are sensitive to similar systematic effects. By providing several strategies in which the uncertainties can be studied and quantified in the more well-understood SM channels, improvements can also propagate to analogous measurements and beyond the SM searches, independent of the ultimate precision on the W boson mass that can be achieved. We therefore believe that the extraction of the W boson mass in the all hadronic final state represents a concrete goal that will benefit the field of jet substructure more broadly.",

For jet p T of 100-500 GeV, the tracking (2-5%) and HCAL resolutions (5-10%) are of similar order at CMS. In this range, a generic particle flow algorithm may promote the HCAL measurement over the tracker one. The threshold p max T,track is chosen such that it matches the jet mass resolution of the current CMS detector [50] at high momenta, and increased by a factor 2 for the HL-LHC Phase-II upgrade of the CMS tracker [51]. The improvement comes from a higher granularity tracking detector which will better distinguish hits from nearby high p T tracks. The generated neutral hadrons are then discretized to simulate the spatial resolution of the electromagnetic (\u03c3 \u03b7 ECAL = \u03c3 \u03c6 ECAL = 0.0175) and hadronic calorimeters (\u03c3 \u03b7 HCAL = \u03c3 \u03c6 HCAL = 0.022). Finally, all particles are smeared according to parametrized resolutions \u03c3 E particle for each particle type (\u03c3 p T charged particles = 0.00025 p T /GeV \u2295 0.015, \u03c3 E photons = 0.021/ E/GeV \u2295 0.094/(E/GeV) \u2295 0.005, \u03c3 E neutral hadrons = 0.45/ E/GeV \u2295 0.05). The resolutions and granularities have been chosen to match the performance of the CMS detector [52]. The resolution in jet mass and substructure variables for W \u2192 qq and single parton jets with p T in the range 300 GeV and 3.5 TeV has been compared to CMS public results and found to be compatible [32,33,53]. The average W \u2192 qq and single parton jet selection efficiencies match with those of CMS [32,33] which are similar to those of ATLAS [30,31]. As such, while we will present results using simulation generated with the CMS detector configuration, the study is representative for the current and future performance of both experiments.",

Soft drop with the angular exponent \u03b2 = 0, soft cutoff threshold z cut = 0.1, and characteristic radius R 0 = 0.8 is applied using the FastJet software package [55]. In addition to the soft drop algorithm, we have considered a set of alternative grooming algorithms, namely ",

Though a moderate improvement is expected combining this measurement with the existing ones due to largely uncorrelated uncertainties, we propose to make use of new trigger strategies for this measurement to increase the number of W \u2192 qq events, following the data scouting approaches explored by CMS [64], ATLAS [65] and LHCb [66], where only limited event information is stored to allow data storage at a higher rate yielding a lower high-level trigger jet p T threshold. The data rate after high-level trigger is the limiting factor for the jet p T threshold at the moment and will likely remain so even at the HL-LHC, because hardware-based triggers using jet substructure information [67] may become feasible to maintain low hardware-based jet p T trigger thresholds. Though trigger level jets currently have larger associated systematic uncertainties than offline jets, we will assume here that the advances in the trigger system for the HL-LHC will allow to achieve the same systematic uncertainties as for offline jets. Table 3 presents scenarios with jet p T trigger thresholds lowered to p T > 300 GeV and p T > 400 GeV at the LHC and HL-LHC. The statistical uncertainties are significantly reduced with lower trigger thresholds, though the achievable statistical uncertainty with the integrated luminosity of 3000/fb and p T > 500 GeV still remains lower than that of 300/fb and p T > 300 GeV. The ultimate statistical uncertainty on the W boson mass measurement that can be achieved is 13 MeV for the m W approach and 32 MeV for the \u2206m = m Z \u2212 m W approach.",

Particles from pileup interactions enter the reconstructed jets of the main interaction and increase their mass. At the HL-LHC, up to 200 of such interactions can happen simultaneously. Dedicated suppression techniques have been developed to remove such contamination, among which we exploit the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [70]. We estimate the shift in jet mass expected with 200 pileup interactions, applying the PUPPI algorithm, and quote how precise the pileup fractional estimate would be needed to model this on average. To reach a W mass precision of 10 MeV, the modeling of the extra jet mass from 200 pileup interactions needs to be at the level of 1.4% (see table 4), which may seem feasible given the achieved 1%-level modeling of the fraction of energy from pileup interactions in jets with p T > 300 GeV [48]. Maintaining this level of the understanding of pileup will, however, remain to be seen. Both ATLAS and CMS experiments plan to upgrade their detection capabilities by introducing better tracking and timing detection systems. The suppression and modeling of up to 200 pileup interactions will nevertheless remain a major experimental challenge.",

The jet p T , mass and \u03b7 distributions are subject to multiple theoretical uncertainties, including parton density functions, factorization and renormalization scales, hadronization models. To demonstrate the dependence of the W jet mass on the prediction of the jet kinematics, we compute the mass difference between W + and W \u2212 jets to 170 MeV, which have different p T and \u03b7 distributions due to the parton composition of the colliding protons. The uncertainty on the W mass due to parton density functions, factorization and renormalization scales used for the prediction of the p T spectra of the W and Z is evaluated by reweighing them to NNLO predictions and varying them according to the NLO PDF, NLO QCD and NLO EW uncertainties computed in ref. [47]. The resulting uncertainties quoted in table 5 show that current predictions of p T spectra for the W and Z have sufficient precision for a 10 MeV W mass measurement, considering only these uncertainty sources.

Additionally, the non-perturbative effects and the impact of jet substructure selection on the W jet mass must be theoretically understood. Figure 7 shows the dependence of the W jet mass distribution on various effects. The non-perturbative effects are studied by disabling hadronization and underlying event in Pythia and computing the jet mass from partons after showering. As a cross check, we also consider the difference between Herwig and Pythia, which are based on different models for non-perturbative effects and parton showering.

Other grooming choices may further reduce these uncertainties. The difference between m Z \u2212 m W (m W ) in Herwig and Pythia after N \u03b2=1 2 < 0.2 selection is also of similar order, ranging from 50-500 MeV (200-1000 MeV) depending on the grooming algorithm used.

In all cases, a significant improvement in understanding of these non-perturbative and showering effects needs to be reached to make this measurement feasible.

This jet mass distribution shape depends strongly on the choice of grooming algorithm and differs between herwig and pythia. Appendix A shows examples of such distributions. We find the jet mass distribution becomes increasingly more asymmetric when going from p T > 500 GeV to p T > 300 GeV. At a jet p T > 500 GeV the difference between m Z \u2212 m W Herwig and Pythia is strongly reduced from that of lower p T jets to 23 MeV for mMDT. This variation ranges from 10-50 MeV for different groomers. By making use of the p T dependence of the jet mass, there is thus potential to constrain the contributions from non-perturbative effects. Thinking beyond the HL-LHC, one should note that this measurement will also benefit from higher center of mass energies at future colliders (e.g. HE-LHC [71] or FCC [72]) due to the fact that non-perturbative effects are significantly reduced for higher W boson p T . Figure 8 shows the dependence of the W and Z jet mass on jet p T and N \u03b2=1 2 selection. The variation of the W and Z jet mass as a function of p T is minimal with N \u03b2=1 2 selection applied and no non-perturbative effects considered. When non-perturbative effects are taken into account, the dependence of the W and Z jet mass on p T are enhanced. However, since W and Z show similar trends as a function of p T , the contribution from non-perturbative effects is reduced for a m Z \u2212 m W measurement, as can also be seen in table 5. Similarly, the N \u03b2=1 2 dependence plot shows the largest shifts when adding nonperturbative effects. However, a similar trend is observed between W and Z bosons. For a very loose selection on N \u03b2=1 JHEP02(2019)003 b-quark hadronization. When considering a W mass measurement using the Z mass peak, an additional uncertainty arises from the theoretical knowledge of the jet mass difference at particle level between the W and Z peak. In particular, the hadronization of b quarks will result in larger uncertainties in the b-hadron decay due to the possible presence of neutrinos in the final state. We quantify the impact of this modeling by computing the difference between the jet mass arising from Z \u2192 qq and Z \u2192 bb decays in table 5. The addition of jet substructure selection significantly reduces this difference. The measurement thus benefits from the jet substructure selection, not only through reduction of background, but also through reduction of systematic effects.",

This difference would need an understanding in the 2-20% range for a precision of 10 MeV, indicating a significant improvement in understanding non-perturbative and showering effects on b-hadronization would be needed to make this measurement feasible. Simultaneously, in Pythia lone, W mass precision of 10 MeV for jets with substructure selection can be achieved with understanding of the hadronization of b quarks at the 7% level, comparable to current b-hadronization uncertainties in dedicated analyses [73], indicative of heavy flavor fragmentation tuning between Herwig and Pythia currently having room for improvement. For c quarks only a 13%-level understanding of the difference between W \u2192 qq and W \u2192 cs is needed as quoted in table 5. The contribution of Z \u2192 cc is suppressed by more than a factor 10 compared to Z \u2192 bb with a typical double b-tagger.",

The resolution of these issues is well beyond the scope of the current paper, and our goal is therefore more to emphasize where progress can be made, and what issues must be overcome. From figure 8, we see that perturbatively there is an extremely weak dependence of the jet mass on the N 2 cut, and that the jet mass aligns well with the W or Z world average. The small negative offset is due to radiation that is not captured in the jet, due to the finite jet radius. These effects can be analytically calculated, and are incorporated in all standard jet substructure calculations. We therefore believe that perturbative effects can be kept under good theoretical control.",

In fact, there are two distinct non-perturbative effects which would need to be understood in order to completely understand this measurement. The first are non-perturbative corrections to the N 2 distribution on which the cut is applied. Non-perturbative effects for the groomed D 2 observable [24,26] (which is closely related to N 2 ) were recently studied in [74][75][76], where it was shown that they take a relatively simple form, and can be modeled by a single parameter shape function. The second is nonperturbative corrections to the jet mass distribution itself. Non-perturbative corrections to the groomed top quark mass distribution were studied in [77], where they were also found to take a simple form. However, non-perturbative effects for the mass distribution for the decay of a color singlet have not, to our knowledge, been studied in the literature. We believe that this deserves further attention. Ideally, these corrections could also be described by a universal shape function that could then be self-consistently extracted with the mass measurement itself.",

This universality would be violated by, for example, b-quark mass effects, but this should be a much smaller effect than the overall shift due to hadronization, and could perhaps be accounted for.

Compared to the lepton plus neutrino final state, a measurement in the all-jets final state could avoid experimental systematic uncertainties related to the measurement of the missing transverse momentum and the theoretical uncertainties related to the transverse mass. While a measurement of the W mass itself seems unrealistic since it would require a significantly better understanding of the jet energy calibration than reached by the current LHC experiments, a measurement of the mass difference between the W and Z bosons is more feasible. New trigger strategies will need to be exploited to reach a statistical uncertainty of 30 MeV with HL-LHC data corresponding to 3000/fb of integrated luminosity. The measurement is, however, limited by the understanding of non-perturbative contributions to the invariant masses of W \u2192 qq and Z \u2192 bb, that would need a significant improvement to reach below 100 MeV precision.",
