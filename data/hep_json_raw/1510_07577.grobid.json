            "text": "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the four main experiments at the LHC, is designed and optimised for the study of heavy-ion collisions. The main objective of the ALICE physics programme is to study the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are not confined into hadrons, that is expected to be formed in high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty), with large masses (m c \u2248 1.3 and m b \u2248 4.5 GeV/c 2 ), are well suited probes to study this state of matter as they are produced in the initial stages of the collision [1] via hard partonic scattering processes before the QGP is formed. So, they experience the full evolution of the medium and lose energy via both collisional and radiative processes [2,3,4] while interacting with the medium constituents, as supported by several experimental observations [5,6,7]. Energy loss effects can be studied by comparing the yield of heavy-flavour particles in heavy-ion collisions to that in pp collisions. The study of heavy-quark production in pp collisions is also important to test perturbative QCD calculations. Measurements in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions are also important to disentangle \"hot\" medium (QGP) effects in heavy-ion collisions from initial-state effects due to cold nuclear matter. Two particle correlations are an efficient tool for investigating the particle production mechanism. Correlations involving heavy quarks in heavy-ion collisions can provide information to understand the heavy-quark energy loss. The D \u2212D correlation studies were proposed at RHIC energies to understand the contributions of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD processes to the correlation functions [8,9]. Azimuthal correlations between D mesons and charged particles in high-energy collisions can give a way to characterise charm production and fragmentation processes. The two dimensional correlations in azimuthal angle and pseudo-rapidity (\u2206\u03d5, \u2206\u03b7) of D mesons and charged particles exhibit a \"near-side\" peak at \u2206\u03d5 = 0 having D mesons as trigger particles, and an \"away-side\" peak at \u2206\u03d5 = \u03c0. In heavy-ion collisions an additional structure emerges, which persists over large \u2206\u03b7 range on near and away side. The shape of the correlation in the azimuthal difference \u2206\u03d5 can be described by expanding it in a Fourier series with coefficients v n . The main component of the Fourier decomposition used to describe the anisotropy in the \u2206\u03d5 distribution is the second order term, called elliptic flow or v 2 . Recently we have seen long range ridge-like structures in high-multiplicity pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [10] and in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV [11,12]. Similar results were obtained in central d-Au collisions at RHIC [13]. Data sample, analysis strategy including the D-meson signal extraction, the associated track selection criteria, and the corrections applied to measure the correlations between prompt D mesons and primary charged particles are reported in section 2. In section 3 results are discussed and a summary is given in section 4.",

            "text": "The azimuthal correlation between D mesons and charged particles is investigated using the following method. First the D (D 0 , D + , D * + and their charge conjugates) mesons are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels [14] and then they are correlated with the primary charged particles in the same event. For D-meson signal extraction we follow the same selection procedure as described here [15,16]. The extraction of D-meson signal is based on the reconstruction of a secondary vertex, separated by few tens of micrometers from the primary vertex. The ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS) provides the necessary resolution to identify the displaced secondary vertices. The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time Of Flight (TOF) detector allow identification of charged pions and kaons up to p T = 2 GeV/c which reduces the combinatorial background of uncorrelated pairs. The raw yield of D mesons is extracted by fitting the invariant mass spectra with a Gaussian for the signal component and an exponential function for the background. Each D-meson candidate is correlated with all the primary charged particles, having p T > 0.3 GeV/c and pseudo-rapidity |\u03b7| < 0.8. In order to subtract the background due to the uncorrelated D candidates under the mass peak, the azimuthal correlation of background candidates in the sidebands of the D-meson peak with primary charged particles is used. The raw correlation (\u2206\u03d5, \u2206\u03b7) between D mesons and charged particles is then corrected by the efficiency of trigger (D mesons) and associated particles (primary charged particles) using Monte Carlo simulated events. In order to take into account the limited detector acceptance and spatial inhomogeneities, an event mixing approach is used. The corrected raw correlation from event mixing is nomalized by the number of triggers calculated via yield extraction using D-meson mass spectra. The per-trigger azimuthal correlation distribution is then obtained by multiplying with the purity of the primary particle sample. D mesons can originate from B-meson decays. In order to correct the raw correlation from correlated D mesons coming from B mesons we use a feed down correction method as described in [15]. Along with feed down correction various systematics uncertainties from D meson yield extraction, background subtraction, efficiency corrections, Monte Carlo closure test are calculated. The fully corrected and normalised per-trigger D meson-charged particle azimuthal correlation is studied in different D-meson p T ranges and with different p T intervals of associated primary charged particles.",

The correlations were studied in three different p T intervals of D mesons and with three different p T thresholds for the associated primary charged particles. We have seen that within uncertainties the correlation results are compatible for the two collision systems, as expected from simulation studies of pp collisions performed at the two center-of-mass energies. With the current amount of data it is not possible to conclude on any possible modification due to cold nuclear matter effects in p-Pb collisions. In the future, with higher statistics and precision, we can study heavy-flavour azimuthal correlations for heavy-ion data recorded by ALICE at the LHC, which could give further insights into the possible charm energy loss mechanism inside the QGP.",
