            "text": "Dalitz analyses are largely applied in modern high-energy experiments to study Heavy Flavor hadronic decays, but also to perform precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements and search for new physics. Paradigmatic examples are B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and B \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * ) for the extraction of the \u03b1 and \u03b3 angles of the Unitarity Triangle. The extraction of \u03b1 in B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 requires filtering the desired intermediate states among all the possible (\u03c0\u03c0)\u03c0 combinations, e.g. \u03c3 \u03c0, f 0 (980)\u03c0 etc. The extraction of \u03b3 in B \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * ) requires, in turn, modeling the D amplitudes. The \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 S-wave are characterized by broad, overlapping states: unitarity is not explicitly guaranteed by a simple sum of Breit-Wigner functions. In addition, independently of the nature of the \u03c3 , it is not a simple Breit-Wigner. The f 0 (980) is a Flatt\u00e9-like function, and its lineshape parametrization needs precise determination of KK and \u03c0\u03c0 couplings. Recent analyses of CP violation in the B \u2192 DK channel from the beauty factories needed two ad hoc resonances to reproduce the excess of events in the \u03c0\u03c0 spectrum, one at the low-mass threshold, the other at 1.1 GeV 2 [1,2]. This procedure of \"effectively\" fitting data invites a word of caution on estimating the systematics of these measurements. A question then naturally arises: in the era of precise measurements, do we know sufficiently well how to deal with strong-dynamics effects in the analyses? We have faced parametrization problems in FOCUS and learnt that many difficulties are already known and studied in different fields, such as nuclear and intermediate-energy physics, where broad, multichannel, overlapping resonances are treated in the K-matrix formalism [3,4,5]. The effort we have made consisted mainly in building a bridge of knowledge and language to reach the high-energy community; our pioneering work in the charm sector might inspire future accurate studies in the beauty sector. FOCUS Dalitz plot analyses of the D+, D s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + will be discussed.",

It was the first application of this formalism in the charm sector. In this model [5], the production process, i.e, the D decay, can be viewed as consisting of an initial preparation of states, described by the P-vector, which then propagates according to (I \u2212 iK\u03c1) \u22121 into the final one. The K-matrix here is the scattering matrix and is used as fixed input in our analysis. Its form was inferred by the global fit to a rich set of data performed in [7]. It is interesting to note that this formalism, beside restoring the proper dynamical features of the resonances, allows for the inclusion in D decays of the knowledge coming from scattering experiments, i.e, an enormous amount of results and science. No re-tuning of the K-matrix parameters was needed. The confidence levels of the final fits are 3.0 % and 7.7 % for the D s and D + respectively. The results were extremely encouraging since the same K-matrix description gave a coherent picture of both two-body scattering measurements in light-quark experiments as well as charm-meson decay. This result was not obvious beforehand. Furthermore, the same model was able to reproduce features of the D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + Dalitz plot, shown in fig.1, that would otherwise require an ad hoc \u03c3 resonance. The better treatment of the S-wave contribution provided by the K-matrix model was able reproduce the low-mass \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 structure of the D + Dalitz plot. This suggests that any \u03c3 -like object in the D decay should be consistent with the same \u03c3 -like object measured in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 scattering. Further considerations and conclusions from the FOCUS three-pion analysis were limited by the sample statistics, i.e. 1475 \u00b1 50 and 1527 \u00b1 51 events for D s and D + respectively.",

Invariant mass and Dalitz plots are shown in fig.2. Details of the analysis may be found in [8].  An additional complication in the K\u03c0 system comes from the presence in the Swave of the two isospin states, I = 1/2 and I = 3/2. Although only the I = 1/2 is dominated by resonances, both isospin components are involved in the decay of the D + meson into K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + . A model for the decay amplitudes of the two isospin states can be constructed from the 2 \u00d7 2 K-matrix describing the I = 1/2 S-wave scattering in (K\u03c0) 1 and (K\u03b7 \u2032 ) 2 (with the subscripts 1 and 2, respectively, labelling these two channels), and the single-channel K-matrix describing the I = 3/2 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + scattering. The Kmatrix form we use as input describes the S-wave K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + scattering from the LASS experiment [9] for energy above 825 MeV and K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 scattering from Estabrooks et al.

Two ad hoc scalar resonances are required, of mass 856 \u00b1 17 and 1461 \u00b1 4 and width 464 \u00b1 28 and 177 \u00b1 8 MeV/c 2 respectively to reproduce the data and reach a \u03c7 2 /d.o.f is 1.17, corresponding to a C.L of 6.8%. A detailed discussion of the results and the systematics can be found in [8]. A feature of the K-matrix amplitude analysis is that it allows an indirect phase measurement of the separate isospin components: it is this phase Adaptive binning and \u03c7 2 contributions for dp to kpp (data)  variation with isospin I = 1/2 that should be compared with the same I = 1/2 LASS phase, extrapolated from 825 GeV down to threshold according to Chiral Perturbation Theory. This is done in the right plot of fig. 5. In this model [5] the P-vector allows for a phase variation accounting for the interaction with the third particle in the process of resonance formation. It so happens that the Dalitz fit gives a nearly constant production phase. The two phases in fig. 5b) have the same behaviour up to \u223c 1.1 GeV. However, approaching K\u03b7 \u2032 threshold, effects of inelasticity and differing final state interactions start to appear. The difference between the phases in fig. 5a) is due to the I = 3/2 component. These results are consistent with K\u03c0 scattering data, and consequently with Watson's theorem predictions for two-body K\u03c0 interactions in the low K\u03c0 mass region, up to \u223c 1.1 GeV, where elastic processes dominate. This means that possible three-body interaction effects, not accounted for in the K-matrix parametrization, play a marginal role. The Kmatrix form used in this analysis generates the S-matrix pole E = M \u2212 i\u0393/2 = 1.408 \u2212 i0.110 GeV. Any more distant pole than K * 0 (1430) is not reliably determined as this simple K-matrix expression does not have the required analyticity properties. However, our K-matrix representation fits along the real energy axis inputs on scattering data and Chiral Perturbation Theory in close agreement with those used in [14], which locates the \u03ba with a mass of (658 \u00b1 13) MeV and a width of (557 \u00b1 24) MeV by careful continuation. These pole parameters are quite different from those implied by the simple isobar fits. We have thus shown that whatever \u03ba is revealed by our D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + results, it is the same as that found in scattering data.",

Details can be found in [16]. The old E687 Dalitz plot analysis [17] concluded that the observed D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + Dalitz plot could be adequately described by just three resonant contributions: \u03c6 \u03c0 + , K +K * (892) and K +K * 0 (1430). Al-though \u03c6 \u03c0 + is an important contribution, the \u03c6 is a very narrow resonance that can be substantially removed through a cut on m K + K \u2212 , i.e m K + K \u2212 > 1050 MeV/c 2 . Since there is no overlap of the \u03c6 band with theK * and most of the kinematically allowed K * 0 (1430) region, there is a relatively small loss of information from the anti-\u03c6 cut; of course careful systematic evaluation for residual K + K \u2212 contributions and bias are performed. In the absence of the K \u2212 K + resonances, we can write the decay amplitude in terms of m K \u2212 \u03c0 + = m and the helicity decay angle \u03b8 Thus",
