The differential cross sections as a function of the Z boson rapidity and transverse momentum are measured. Though they are found to be consistent within uncertainty with theoretical predictions both with and without nuclear effects, the forward-backward asymmetry suggests the presence of nuclear effects at large rapidities.

            "text": "With its large center-of-mass energy and high luminosity, the LHC enables for the first time the study of Z and W boson production in heavy ion collisions. Electroweak bosons are unmodified by the hot and dense medium created in nucleus-nucleus collisions, and their leptonic decays are of particular interest since leptons pass through the medium without being affected by the strong interaction. Both the Z and W boson production were measured by the ATLAS [9,10] and the CMS [11,12] experiments using PbPb collisions taken in 2010 and 2011 at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, confirming that the production cross section scales with the number of elementary nucleon-nucleon collisions with a precision of about 10%. However, in nuclear collisions, the production of electroweak bosons can be affected by the initial conditions of the collision. The free-proton PDFs are expected to be modified for protons bound in the Pb nucleus, which, together with the fact that the nucleus contains neutrons as well as protons (isospin effect), can modify the observed cross sections as compared to pp collisions. Various groups have studied the nuclear modification of PDFs, and several E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. results are available at next-to-leading-order (NLO) precision in QCD [13][14][15]. These results are obtained by global fits to the available deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan data, which constrain the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) in the region of parton longitudinal momentum fraction x > 10 \u22122 and four-momentum transfer squared Q 2 < (10 GeV) 2 .",

Processes mediated by a virtual photon and interference effects are also considered as part of the Z boson signal. The rapidity distribution of Z bosons is particularly sensitive to the parton content of the interacting nucleons. Consequently, the symmetric rapidity spectrum of the Z bosons in the center-ofmass frame of pp collisions is modified by nuclear effects in pPb collisions [24]. This can be quantified through measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry in the center-of-mass frame: where by convention positive rapidity values correspond to the direction of the incoming proton.",

The measurements in the muon final state are based on a sample obtained by requiring at least one muon with p T greater than 12 GeV/c. The muon candidates are reconstructed with an algorithm that combines information from both the silicon tracker and the muon system [28]. Background muons from cosmic rays and heavy-quark semileptonic decays are rejected by applying a set of quality criteria to each muon, based on previous studies of the performance of the muon reconstruction [28]. The muons are selected by requiring at least two muon stations to be matched to the muon track, a low \u03c7 2 /ndf of the global fit, a minimum number of tracker layers and pixel hits, and finally, a maximum distance from the primary vertex in the transverse and longitudinal direction.",

A correction of the electron energy resolution is applied to MC by comparing the mass distribution of electron pairs between data and MC. Such corrections are also estimated for the Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channel and found to be negligible.

This number is found to be 2183 in the muon channel and 1571 in the electron channel. The difference between the two channels is due to the tighter selection criteria applied to the electrons in order to suppress the higher background. A charge misidentification correction of 1% is applied to the dielectron yields; this correction is negligible for dimuons. No events are found with more than one Z boson candidate.

Although the expected background contamination is small, an estimate based on data is used to subtract its contribution from the dilepton raw yield. For tt, bb, WW, and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 processes, two electron-muon events are expected for each dimuon or dielec-tron event, because of lepton universality. In the Z boson mass range, the oppositely-charged electron-muon pairs are counted and translated into the expected number of muon or electron pairs, taking into account the differences in the muon and electron reconstruction and selection efficiencies. This background is subtracted from the dilepton raw yield and accounts for the main electroweak and tt backgrounds, as well as for the part of QCD multijet background (such as bb decays) that produces oppositelycharged leptons. The background from random combinations of other leptons in the event is estimated by counting the samecharge pairs. Additional electroweak contributions from W+jets and diboson production are found to be negligible via MC simulations.
