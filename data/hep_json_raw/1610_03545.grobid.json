            "text": "Single top quark (t) production provides ways to investigate aspects of top quark physics that cannot be studied with tt events [1]. The theory of electroweak interactions predicts three mechanisms for producing single top quarks in hadron-hadron collisions. At leading order (LO), these are classified according to the virtuality of the W boson propagation in t-channel, s-channel, or associated tW production [2]. Single top quark production in all channels is directly related to the squared modulus of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element V tb . As a consequence, it provides a direct measurement of this quantity and thereby a check of the standard model (SM). The single top quark topology also opens a window for searches of anomalous Wtb couplings relative to the SM, where the interaction vertex of the top quark with the bottom quark (b) and the W boson (Wtb vertex) has a V-A axial-vector structure. Flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are absent at lowest order in the SM, and are significantly suppressed through the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism [3] at higher orders. Various rare decays of K, D, and B mesons, as well as the oscillations in K 0 K 0 , D 0 D 0 , and B 0 B 0 systems, strongly constrain FCNC interactions -1 -",

            "text": "involving the first two generations and the b quark [4]. The V-A structure of the charged current with light quarks is well established [4]. However, FCNC involving the top quark, as well as the structure of the Wtb vertex, are significantly less constrained. In the SM, the FCNC couplings of the top quark are predicted to be very small and not detectable at current experimental sensitivity. However, they can be significantly enhanced in various SM extensions, such as supersymmetry [5][6][7], and models with multiple Higgs boson doublets [8][9][10], extra quarks [11][12][13], or a composite top quark [14]. New vertices with top quarks are predicted, in particular, in models with light composite Higgs bosons [15,16], extra-dimension models with warped geometry [17], or holographic structures [18]. Such possibilities can be encoded in an effective field theory through higher-dimensional gaugeinvariant operators [19,20]. Direct limits on top quark FCNC parameters have been established by the CDF [21], D0 [22], and ATLAS [23] Collaborations. There are two complementary strategies to search for FCNC in single top quark production. A search can be performed in the s channel for resonance production through the fusion of a gluon (g) with an up (u) or charm (c) quark, as was the case in analyses by the CDF and ATLAS Collaborations. However, as pointed out by the D0 Collaboration, the s-channel production rate is proportional to the square of the FCNC coupling parameter and is therefore expected to be small [22]. On the other hand, the t-channel cross section and its corresponding kinematic properties have been measured accurately at the LHC [24][25][26], with an important feature being that the t-channel signature contains a light-quark jet produced in association with the single top quark. This light-quark jet can be used to search for deviations from the SM prediction caused by FCNC in the top quark sector. This strategy was applied by the D0 Collaboration [22], as well as in our analysis. Models that have contributions from FCNC in the production of single top quarks can have sizable deviations relative to SM predictions. Processes with FCNC vertices in the decay of the top quark are negligible. In contrast, the modelling of Wtb couplings can involve anomalous Wtb interactions in both the production and the decay, because both are significantly affected by anomalous contributions. All these features are explicitly taken into account in the CompHEP Monte Carlo (MC) generator [27]. In this paper, we present a search by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC for anomalous Wtb couplings and FCNC interactions of the top quark through the u or c quarks and a gluon (tug or tcg vertices), by selecting muons arising from W boson decay (including through a \u03c4 lepton) from the top quarks in muon+jets events. Separation of signal and background is achieved through a Bayesian neural network (BNN) technique [28,29], performed using the Flexible Bayesian modelling package [30]. Limits on Wtb and top quark FCNC anomalous couplings are obtained from the distribution in the BNN discriminants.",

The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [31]. The particle-flow event algorithm [32,33] reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. Jets are reconstructed offline from particle-flow candidates clustered by the anti-k T algorithm [34,35] with a size parameter of 0.5. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossing (pileup). Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T [32].",

            "text": "Contributions from anomalous operators are added to the CompHEP simulation for both the production and decay of top quarks. This takes into account the width of the top quark, spin correlations between the production and decay, and the b quark mass in the anomalous and SM contributions. The LO MadGraph 5.1 [41] generator is used to simulate the main background processes: top quark pair production with total cross sections of \u03c3(7 TeV) = 172.0 +6.5 \u22127.6 pb [42] and \u03c3(8 TeV) = 253 +13 \u221214 pb [43], and W boson production with total cross sections of \u03c3(7 TeV) = 31.3 \u00b1 1.6 nb and \u03c3(8 TeV) = 36.7 \u00b1 1.3 nb [44], for processes with up to 3 and 4 additional jets in the matrix element calculations, respectively. The subdominant backgrounds from Drell-Yan in association with jets (Z/\u03b3 * +jets) production, corresponding to \u03c3(7 TeV) = 5.0 \u00b1 0.3 nb and \u03c3(8 TeV) = 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 nb [44], and from WW, WZ, and ZZ (dibosons) production, corresponding to \u03c3(7 TeV) = 67.1 \u00b1 1.7 pb and \u03c3(8 TeV) = 73.8 \u00b1 1.9 pb [45] are modelled using LO pythia 6.426 [46]. The contribution from multijet events, with one of the jets misidentified as a lepton, is estimated using a mutually exclusive data sample. The details are given in the next section. Single top quark production in the s channel with \u03c3(7 TeV) = 4.6 +0.2 \u22120.2 pb, \u03c3(8 TeV) = 5.5 \u00b1 0.2 pb, and in the tW channel with \u03c3(7 TeV) = 15.7 \u00b1 1.2 pb, \u03c3(8 TeV) = 22.2 \u00b1 1.5 pb [47] are modelled using the powheg generator. The pythia 6.4 program is also used to simulate parton showers for the hard processes calculated in the CompHEP, MadGraph, and powheg generators. The PDF4LHC recipe [48] is used to reweight all simulated events to the central value of CT10 PDF [49]. The Z2Star [50,51] set of parameters is used to simulate the underlying-events. Because of the importance of the W+jets background and the significant difference in the kinematic distributions, the following contributions are considered separately in the analysis: W boson produced together with a pair of b or c quarks (W+QQ); W boson produced in association with a c quark (W+c); W boson events that do not contain heavy quarks (W+light); and events associated with underlying events (UE) that contain heavy quarks originating from the initial parton interaction (W+QX). Different nuisance parameters for the normalization scale factors are used for these components of the complete W+jets MadGraph simulation. Simulated events are reweighted to reproduce the observed particle multiplicity from pileup. Small differences between the data and simulation in trigger efficiency [52,53], lepton identification and isolation [52,53], and b tagging [54] are corrected via scale factors, which are generally close to unity.",

The kinematic properties of the potential tcg and tug contributions are slightly different owing to the different initial states and the discussion of the couplings appears in section 8. The input variables used by each BNN are summarised in table 2. Their choice is based on the difference in the structure of the Feynman diagrams contributing to the signal and background processes. Distributions of four representative variables for data and simulated events are shown in figure 2. Several variables in the analysis require full kinematic reconstruction of the top quark and W boson candidates. For the kinematic reconstruction of the top quark, the W boson mass constraint is applied to extract the component of the neutrino momentum along the beam direction (p z ). This leads to a quadratic equation in p z . For two real solutions of the equation, the smaller value of p z is used as the solution. For events with complex solutions, the imaginary components are eliminated by modifying E miss T such that m T (W) = M W [4]. The data-to-simulation comparisons shown in figure 3 demonstrate good agreement in the control regions enriched in top quark pair events (4 jets with 2 b tags) and W+jets (no b-tagged jets), as well as in the signal regions, as discussed in section 4.

The symbol \"tug\" marks the variables used just in the training of the tug FCNC BNN. The notations \"leading\" and \"next-to-leading\" refer to the highest-p T and second-highest-p T jet, respectively. The notation \"best\" jet is used for the jet that gives a reconstructed mass of the top quark closest to the value of 172.5 GeV, which is used in the MC simulation.    ties of the corresponding parameters, \u03c0(d) is a normalization factor, and p(d| \u00b5 s , \u00b5 b , \u03b8) is the probability to obtain a given d with given \u00b5 s , \u00b5 b , and \u03b8. Uncertainties considered in the analysis are discussed next. For the variation of the background normalization, scale parameters are introduced in the statistical model, and the corresponding variations of these parameters are the same as for the SM measurement in ref. [59]. All background processes and their normalizations are treated as being statistically independent. To estimate the uncertainty in the multijet distributions, two different isolation criteria are used (0.3 < I \u00b5 rel < 0.5 and 0.5 < I \u00b5 rel < 1). Also, a comparison is made between data and events generated with the pythia 6.4 simulation. The impact of the changes in the multijet template are well within the range of \u221250% to +100%, and this is included as a prior uncertainty in the statistical model. To estimate the uncertainties in the detector-related jet and E miss T corrections, the four-momenta of all reconstructed jets in simulated events are scaled simultaneously in accordance with p T -and \u03b7-dependent jet energy correction (JEC) uncertainties [60]. These changes are also propagated to E miss T . The effect of the 10% uncertainty in E miss T coming from unclustered energy deposits in the calorimeters that are not associated with jets is estimated after subtracting all the jet and lepton energies from the E miss T calculation. Parameters in the procedure to correct the jet energy resolution (JER) are varied within their uncertainties, and the procedure is repeated for all jets in the simulation [60,61]. The variations coming from the uncertainty in the b quark tagging JHEP02 2017   efficiency and mistagging rate of jets are propagated to the simulated events [54]. The uncertainties for c quark jets are assumed to be twice as large as for b quark jets. The scale factors for tagging b and c quark jets are treated as fully correlated, whereas the mistagging scale factors are varied independently. The integrated luminosity in the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data-taking periods is measured with a relative uncertainty of 2.2% [62] and 2.6% [63], respectively. In the combined fits, all experimental uncertainties, including these from the integrated luminosity, are treated as uncorrelated between the data sets. The uncertainty in the pileup modelling is estimated by using different multiplicity distributions obtained JHEP02 (2017)028by changing the minimum-bias cross section by \u00b15% [64]. Trigger scale factors, muon identification, and muon isolation uncertainties are introduced in the statistical model as additional factors, Gaussian-distributed parameters with a mean of 1 and widths of 0.2%, 0.5%, and 0.2%, respectively. The uncertainties from additional hard-parton radiation and the matching of the samples with different jet multiplicity are evaluated by doubling or halving the threshold for the MadGraph jet-matching procedure for the top quark pair and W+jets production, using dedicated MadGraph samples generated with such shifts in the parameters [65]. The renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties are estimated using MC simulated samples generated by doubling or halving the renormalization and factorization scales for the signal and the main background processes. Uncertainties in the parton distribution functions (PDF) are evaluated with the CT10 PDF set according to the PDF4LHC formulae for Hessian-based sets. We follow this recommendation and reweight the simulated events to obtain the uncertainty, which is about 5% on average. The uncertainty from the choice of the event generator to model the signal is estimated using pseudo-experiments. These pseudo-experiments are used to fit simulated events, obtained from the CompHEP signal sample, and from the powheg signal sample. Half of the difference between these two measurements is taken as the uncertainty (5%). Previous CMS studies [66,67] of top quark pair production showed a softer p T distribution of the top quark in the data than predicted by the NLO simulation. A correction for the simulation of tt production background is applied. The small effect of this reweighting procedure (0.8%) is taken into account as an uncertainty. The uncertainty owing to the finite size of the simulated samples is taken into account through the Barlow-Beeston method [68]. The BNN discriminant distributions can be affected by different types of systematic uncertainties. Some of these only impact the overall normalization, while others change the shape of the distribution. Both types of systematic uncertainties are included in the statistical model through additional nuisance parameters. Systematic uncertainties related to the modelling of JEC, JER, b tagging and mistagging rates, E miss T , and pileup, are included as nuisance parameters in the fit. The variations in these quantities leads to a total uncertainty of about 6%. Other systematic uncertainties, i.e. those related to the signal model, renormalization and factorization scales, matching of partons to final jets, and choice of PDF, are handled through the pseudo-experiments to determine the difference between the varied and the nominal result. The total uncertainty from these sources is about 8%. We include uncertainties in the statistical model by following the same approach as described in previous CMS measurements of the single top quark t-channel cross section [24,58,59]. The SM BNN discriminant distribution after the statistical analysis and evaluation of all the uncertainties are shown in figure 4 for the two data sets. As the \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data sets have similar selection criteria, reweighting, and uncertainties and the physics is expected to also be similar, the data sets are combined by performing a joint fit. The previously described systematic uncertainties and methods of statistical analysis are used in the combination. In the statistical model, the experimental uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between the data sets. The theoretical uncertainties (from the choice of generator, scales, and PDF) are treated as fully correlated between the data sets.  their corresponding systematic uncertainties. Therefore, the combined statistical model does not necessarily provide the tightest exclusion limits. In order to validate the analysis strategy and the statistical treatment of the uncertainties, we measure the cross sections in the SM t channel, and find values and uncertainties in agreement with previous measurements [58,59] and with the prediction of the SM. The t-channel single top quark production is sensitive to possible deviations from the SM prediction for the Wtb vertex. The most general, lowest-dimension, CP-conserving Lagrangian for the Wtb vertex has the following form [69,70]:",

Owing to the possible presence of a FCNC tug or tcg signal, two BNNs are trained to distinguish each of the couplings. The variable choices for these BNNs, shown in table 2, are motivated by analysis of the Feynman diagrams of the FCNC and SM processes. The comparison of the neural network output for the data and model is shown in figure 9. Output histograms from the tug and tcg FCNC BNN discriminants for the SM backgrounds are used as input to the analysis. The posterior probability distributions of |\u03ba tug |/\u039b and |\u03ba tcg |/\u039b are obtained by fitting the histograms. The combined \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV observed and expected exclusion limits at 68% and 95% CL on the anomalous FCNC parameters in the form of two-dimensional contours are shown in figure 10. The two-dimensional contours reflect the possible simultaneous presence of the two FCNC parameters. Individual exclusion limits on |\u03ba tug |/\u039b are obtained by integrating over |\u03ba tcg |/\u039b and vice versa. These individual limits can be used to calculate the upper limits on the branching fractions B(t \u2192 ug) and B(t \u2192 cg) [78]. The observed and expected exclusion limits at 95% CL on the FCNC couplings and the corresponding branching fractions are given in table 4. These limits are significantly better than those obtained by the D0 [22] and CDF [21] experiments, and in previous CMS results, and are comparable to recent ATLAS measurements [23].",
