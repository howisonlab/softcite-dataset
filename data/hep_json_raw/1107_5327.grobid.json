Even more recently, theoretical work looking to explain these data suggest the widely-used Fermi Gas model [1] is insufficient for scattering in a nuclear environment, where intra-nuclear correlations may play a larger role than previously expected [2,3,4]. Significant effects from multi-nucleon correlations in a nuclear environment are also seen in electron scattering data [5].",

            "text": "The MiniBooNE flux prediction uses dedicated \u03c0 \u00b1 double-differential cross section measurements from the HARP experiment [6]. As Figure 1 shows, most of the production phase space of so-called \"right-sign\" particles (i.e., neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) are covered by the HARP data. However, \"wrong-sign\" particles mostly arise from very forward-going pions that escape deflection by the magnetic horn, and this region is not covered by the HARP data. Most of the wrong-sign MiniBooNE flux prediction is therefore extrapolated from the existing HARP data and is largely uncertain.  Clearly, a dedicated study of the neutrino content of the primarily anti-neutrino beam must be made before precise anti-neutrino CCQE cross sections can be made. Three independent and complementary measurements of this crucial background are presented in this section: we evaluate charged-curent single \u03c0 + (CC1\u03c0 + , \u03bd l + N \u2192 l + N + \u03c0) event rates, exploit \u00b5 \u2212 capture in the detector medium, and finally the muon angular distribution of the CCQE sample is fit to a sum of the simulated \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 distributions to measure the neutrino component of the anti-neutrino beam. In all three measurements, the relevant \u03bd \u00b5 channels in simulation have been corrected to reflect the observed cross sections from neutrino-mode data, and therefore the measurements are interpreted as a flux calibration. The CC1\u03c0 + and CCQE angular fit methods and results are presented in more detail in Ref. [7]. This work represents the first measurement of the neutrino component of an anti-neutrino beam using a non-magnetized detector.",

Absolute and differential cross sections for CC1\u03c0 + have been measured previously using the MiniBooNE neutrino-mode data [9], and these are applied to simulation in the present analysis. In this way, the residual level of agreement between data and simulation measures the accuracy of the extrapolated flux prediction discussed in the previous section.

Using separate axial masses for the hydrogen (\"M H A \") and carbon (\"M C A \") scattering components, model comparisons to data are presented in Figures 3 and 4. For simultaneous consistency with the light target results and the neutrino-mode MiniBooNE measurement, the value of M H A (M C A ) is set to 1.02 (1.35) GeV for the absolute comparison, while a shape comparison is made with this prediction and also with M H A = M C A = 1.02 GeV. The latter choice does not describe the data shape, while the shape provided by the former parameter set is consistent but is also roughly 20% low in normalization. ",
