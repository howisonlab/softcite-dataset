            "text": "By globally analyzing all existing measured branching fractions for D \u2192 \u03c0e + \u03bde decays, partial decay rates in different four momentum transfer-squared q 2 bins, as well as products of the decay form factor f \u03c0 + (q 2 ) and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix element |V cd |, we obtain f \u03c0 + (0)|V cd | = 0.1428 \u00b1 0.0019. This product, in conjunction with |V cd | from a global Standard Model fit, implies a value for the D \u2192 \u03c0 semileptonic form factor f \u03c0 + (0) = 0.634 \u00b1 0.008 \u00b1 0.002, which is consistent within error with those calculated in theory based on QCD, but with higher precision than the most accurate f \u03c0 + (0)LQCD = 0.666 \u00b1 0.020 \u00b1 0.021 calculated in LQCD by a factor of 3.3. Alternately, using this product together with the most accurate form factor calculated in LQCD, we find |V cd | D\u2192\u03c0e + \u03bde = 0.2144 \u00b1 0.0029exp \u00b1 0.0093LQCD. Combining this |V cd | D\u2192\u03c0e + \u03bde together with |V cd | D + \u2192\u00b5 + \u03bd\u00b5 = 0.2160 \u00b1 0.0049 \u00b1 0.0014 extracted from both the BESIII and CLEO-c measurements of D + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u00b5 decays, we find the most precisely extracted |V cd | to be |V cd | = 0.2157 \u00b1 0.0045 up to date, which improves the accuracy of the PDG'2014 value |V cd | PDG \u2032 2014 = 0.225 \u00b1 0.008 by over 70%. Using this |V cd | together with the PDG'2014 |V ud | and |V td |, we check for first column unitarity and find |V ud | 2 + |V cd | 2 + |V td | 2 \u2212 1 = \u22120.004 \u00b1 0.002, which deviates from unitarity by 2\u03c3. In addition, we find the ratio of f \u03c0 + (0) and D + decay constant f D + to be f \u03c0 + (0)/f D + = (3.11 \u00b1 0.08) GeV \u22121 , which can be used to validate LQCD calculations for these two quantities.",

I. In 2009, the CLEO Collaboration studied the semileptonic decays of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e and D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd e decays by analyzing 818 pb \u22121 data collected at 3.773 GeV with the CLEO-c detector. Using double tag method, they measured the decay rates for semileptonic D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e and D + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + \u03bd e decays in seven q 2 bins [10]. These measurements of decay rates are summarized in Tabs. I  and II. In 2006, the Belle Collaboration published results on the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd \u2113 decays. They accumulated 56461 \u00b1 309 \u00b1 830 inclusive D 0 mesons and found 126 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 3 signal events for D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays and 106 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 6 signal events for D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays from 282 fb \u22121 data collected around 10.58 GeV with the Belle detector [11]. Using these selected events from semileptonic D 0 decays, the Belle Collaboration obtained the form factors f \u03c0 + (q 2 ) in ten q 2 bins with the bin size of 0.3 GeV 2 /c 4 . To obtain the product f \u03c0 + (q 2 i )|V cd | which will be used in our comprehensive analysis in Section III, we extrapolate these measurements of form factors at the Belle experiment to the product f \u03c0 + (q 2 i )|V cd | using the PDG'2006 value of |V cd | = 0.2271 \u00b1 0.0010 [12] which was originally used in the Belle's paper published. Table III lists the form factors f \u03c0 + (q 2 i ) measured at the Belle experiment and our translated products f \u03c0 + (q 2 i )|V cd |. These products will be used in our further analysis described in Section III.  Recently, the BESIII Collaboration reported preliminary results of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays obtained by analyzing 2.92 fb \u22121 data taken at 3.773 GeV. The BE-SIII Collaboration accumulated (279.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 4D0 tags from five hadronic decay modes. In this sample ofD 0 tags, they observed 6297 \u00b1 87 signal events for D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays [13,14], and measured differential rates of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays at nine q 2 bins from 0.0 to 3.0 GeV 2 . By analyzing these differential decay rates the BESIII collaboration measured a value of the product [13,14] f \u03c0 + (0)|V cd | = 0.1420 \u00b1 0.0024 \u00b1 0.0010, which is obtained from a fit to the data in the case of that the form of form factor is parameterized with threeparameters series expansion (see Section III). The last row of Tab. III lists this f \u03c0 + (0)|V cd |, where the error is the combined statistical and systematic errors.",

From this product we determined the form factor f \u03c0 + (0) = 0.634 \u00b1 0.008 \u00b1 0.002, which is in good agreement within error with LQCD calculations of the form factor, but with more precision than the most accurate LQCD calculation of the form factor by 3.3 factors. We also determined the ratio of the semileptonic form factor f \u03c0 + from LQCD calculations. The experimental ratio is in excellent agreement within error with that determined from LQCD calculations of these two quantities. Alternately, with the recently most precise semileptonic D \u2192 \u03c0e + \u03bd e decay form factor calculated in LQCD, we obtain |V cd | D\u2192\u03c0e + \u03bde = 0.2144 \u00b1 0.0029 \u00b1 0.0093, where the error is still dominated by the uncertainties in LQCD calculation of the semileptonic D \u2192 \u03c0 form factor.

Alternatively, by inserting |V cd | = 0.22522 \u00b1 0.00061 from the global SM fit [6] into Eq.
