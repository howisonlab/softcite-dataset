An example of such particles are leptoquarks (LQs), colour triplet bosons which are a generic prediction of grand unified theories [1], composite models [2], technicolour [3] and supersymmetry with R-parity violation [4]. In the Standard Model (SM) particle interactions conserve lepton flavour, and if this property is extended to LQ models, any such particles produced at HERA would decay exclusively into a quark and a first generation lepton, namely an electron 1 or a neutrino. Dedicated searches have been performed at HERA for such leptoquarks, where the SM expectation is dominated by neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) background [5][6][7].",

Searches for such signatures have been performed at HERA and limits on LFV leptoquark production have been derived [5,8,9]. In this paper a search for LFV phenomena is performed using e \u00b1 p collision data at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 319 GeV, recorded during the years 1998-2007 by the H1 experiment at HERA. The corresponding integrated luminosity of 245 pb \u22121 for e + p collisions and 166 pb \u22121 for e \u2212 p collisions represents an increase in size of the data sample with respect to the previous publication by a factor of 3 and 12, respectively. Data collected from 2003 onwards were taken with a longitudinally polarised lepton beam, with polarisation typically at a level of 35%. The presented results supersede those derived in previous searches for lepton flavour violating leptoquarks by the H1 experiment [8].",

Direct and resolved photoproduction of jets and prompt photon production are simulated using the PYTHIA [17] event generator, which is based on Born level scattering matrix elements. In RAPGAP and PYTHIA, jet production from higher order QCD radiation is simulated using leading logarithmic parton showers and hadronisation is modelled with Lund string fragmentation [18]. Inclusive CC DIS events are simulated using the DJANGOH [19] program, which includes first order leptonic QED radiative corrections based on HERACLES. The production of two or more jets in DJANGOH is accounted for using the colour dipole model [20]. The leading order MC prediction of processes with two or more high transverse momentum jets in NC DIS, CC DIS and photoproduction is scaled by a factor of 1.2 to account for the incomplete description of higher orders in the MC generators [21,22]. Contributions arising from the production of single W bosons and multi-lepton events are modelled using the EPVEC [23] and GRAPE [24] event generators, respectively. The uncertainties on the SM background predictions are described in section 6.

A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used with the origin at the nominal primary ep interaction vertex. The proton beam direction defines the positive z axis (forward direction). The polar angle \u03b8 and the transverse momenta P T of all particles are defined with respect to this axis. The azimuthal angle \u03c6 defines the particle direction in the transverse plane. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan \u03b8 2 . The Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter [27] covers the polar angle range 4 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 154 \u2022 with full azimuthal acceptance. The energies of electromagnetic showers are measured in the LAr with a precision of \u03c3(E)/E \u2243 11%/ E/GeV \u2295 1% and hadronic energy depositions with \u03c3(E)/E \u2243 50%/ E/GeV \u2295 2%, as determined in test beam measurements [28,29]. A leadscintillating fibre calorimeter (SpaCal) [30] covering the backward region 153 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 178 \u2022 completes the measurement of charged and neutral particles. For electrons a relative energy resolution of \u03c3(E)/E \u2243 7%/ E/GeV \u2295 1% is reached, as determined in test beam measurements [31]. The central (20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 160 \u2022 ) and forward (7 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 25 \u2022 ) inner tracking detectors are used to measure charged particle trajectories and to reconstruct the interaction vertex. The measured trajectories fitted to the interaction vertex are referred to as tracks in the following. The LAr calorimeter and inner tracking detectors are enclosed in a superconducting magnetic coil with a field strength of 1.16 T. From the curvature of charged particle trajectories in the magnetic field, the central tracking system provides transverse momentum measurements with a resolution of \u03c3 P T /P T = 0.005P T /GeV \u2295 0.015 [32]. The return yoke of the magnetic coil is the outermost part of the detector and is equipped with streamer tubes forming the central muon detector (4 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 171 \u2022 ). In the very forward region of the detector (3 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 17 \u2022 ) a set of drift chambers detects muons and measures their momenta using an iron toroidal magnet. The luminosity is determined from the rate of the Bethe-Heitler process ep \u2192 ep\u03b3, measured using a photon detector located close to the beam pipe at z = \u2212103 m, in the backward direction.",

The trigger efficiency is about 60% for events with a transverse momentum imbalance measured in the calorimeter of 12 GeV, rising to about 90% for an imbalance of 25 GeV [33].

Jets are reconstructed from these objects using an inclusive k T algorithm [37,38] with a minimum P T of 4 GeV and a distance parameter R = 1.0.

Only first generation quarks are considered in these limits. The limits are most stringent at low LQ masses with values of O(10 \u22123 ) at m LQ = 100 GeV. The limits corresponding to LQs coupling to a u quark are more stringent than those corresponding to LQs coupling to the d quark only, as expected from the larger u quark density in the proton. Corresponding to the steeply falling parton density function for high values of x, the LQ production cross section decreases rapidly and exclusion limits are less stringent towards higher LQ masses. For LQ mass values near the kinematic limit of 319 GeV, the limit corresponding to a resonantly produced LQ turns smoothly into a limit on the virtual effects of both an off-shell s-channel LQ process and a u-channel LQ exchange. At masses m LQ \u226b \u221a s the two processes contract to an effective four-fermion interaction, where the cross section is proportional to (\u03bb eq \u03bb \u00b5(\u03c4 )q /m 2 LQ ) 2 . For a coupling \u03bb of electromagnetic strength, where \u03bb = \u221a 4\u03c0\u03b1 em = 0.3, LFV leptoquarks produced in ep collisions decaying to a muon-quark or a tau-quark pair are excluded at 95% confidence level up to leptoquark masses of 712 GeV and 479 GeV, respectively.The limits on \u03bb eq = \u03bb \u00b5(\u03c4 )q in the region m LQ \u226b \u221a s are transformed into a limit on the value \u03bb eq i \u03bb \u00b5(\u03c4 )q j /m 2 LQ and shown in tables 1 and 2 for F = 0 LQs and in tables 3 and 4 for F = 2 LQs. For each LQ type, the limit is calculated for the hypothesis of a process with only the quarks of flavours i and j involved. With respect to quark flavours, the selection criteria described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 are inclusive since no flavour tagging of the hadronic jet is used. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the analysis to different quark flavours varies due to the parton content of the proton and the presence of the u-channel exchange. Leptoquark couplings to the top quark are not considered in these limits.",
