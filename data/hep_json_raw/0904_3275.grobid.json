In the Dirac theory of a charged pointlike spin-1/2 particle, g = 2, and QED effects slightly increase the g value. Conventionally, a quantity a \u2261 (g \u2212 2)/2 is referred to as the anomalous magnetic moment. The electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments have been measured with a very high relative accuracy of 0.24 ppb [ 1] and 0.54 ppm [ 2], respectively. The theoretical prediction for a e is only mildly affected by strong and weak interactions providing a test of QED and giving the most precise value of the fine-structure constant \u03b1. In contrast, a \u00b5 allows to test all sectors of the Standard Model since all of them contribute significantly to the total.",

Therefore, a high-precision measurement of the corresponding cross section is one of the main goals of low energy experiments. In addition to the previously published \u03c1 meson data [ 25], CMD-2 reported their final results on the pion form factor F \u03c0 from 370 to 1380 MeV [ 26,27,28]. The new \u03c1 meson sample has an order of magnitude larger statistics and a systematic error of 0.8%. SND measured F \u03c0 from 390 to 970 MeV with a systematic error of 1.3% [ 29]. KLOE studied F \u03c0 using the method of radiative return or ISR [ 30,31,32] at 590 < \u221a s < 970 MeV with a sample of 1.5 \u2022 10 6 events and systematic error of 1.3% [ 33]. The |F \u03c0 | values from CMD-2 and SND are in good agreement. The KLOE data are consistent with them near the \u03c1 meson peak, but exhibit a somewhat different energy dependence: they are higher to the left and lower to the right of the \u03c1 meson peak. However, the contributions to a \u00b5 from all three experiments are consistent. After further analysis of the data with a higher statistics (more than three million events selected), KLOE reports the |F \u03c0 | values closer to those of CMD-2 and SND and achieves a 0.9% systematic error [ 34]. First results on the 2\u03c0 contribution coming from BaBar will provide additional information on this channel [ 35].",

Some idea about the contributions to a had,LO \u00b5 coming from different energy ranges and their uncertainties is given in Fig. 1. Below  1.4 GeV practically all final states have been measured with consistent results by the CMD-2 and SND groups in Novosibirsk [ 36]. Figure 2 shows cross sections of various final states measured at CMD-2. Impressive results on various final states with more than two hadrons above Processes first time the cross sections of new channels, they show that some of the previous results should be reconsidered. For example, the BaBar results on the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [ 37] agree well with those of SND [ 42] below 1.4 GeV, but are considerably higher and just inconsistent with those of DM2 [ 43] at higher energies. The overall contribution of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state from 1 to 2 GeV (excluding the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 one) has been (2.45 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b1 0.03) \u2022 10 \u221210 before the BaBar data appeared and it becomes (3.25\u00b10.09\u00b10.01)\u202210 \u221210 if we replace the DM2 piece with a much more precise one from BaBar. Using the new data below 1.8 GeV discussed above in addition to the whole data set of [ 19,23] for old experiments, one can reevaluate the leading-order hadronic contribution to a \u00b5 . The data-based calculations [ 20,21,22] slightly differ by the integration method and the cut-off energy above which the predictions of perturbative QCD are used, but otherwise are essentially very similar. In Table 2 we show the results for different energy ranges following [ 20].",

The improved precision of the leading-order hadronic contribution allows to confirm previously observed excess of the experimental value of a \u00b5 over the SM prediction with a higher than before significance of 3.3 standard deviations. Two other most recent evaluations also claim a large excess of 3.4\u03c3 [ 21] and 3.1\u03c3 [ 22]. Results of the comparison are also shown in Fig. 3.

We believe that we understand well the radiative corrections due to initial-state radiation and vacuum polarization, but should not forget that they are numerically rather large and may reach \u223c 20%, so their critical reanalysis and tests of the existing Monte Carlo generators are needed. The situation with the radiative corrections due to final state radiation is not so well established, so we have to rely on the model of scalar electrodynamics and confront it with the data. This may increase the uncertainty of a had,LO \u00b5 . There is also a question of double counting of the hadronic final states in the leading-and higher-order hadronic terms [ 58].",

However, it turns out that while in a relatively small range of masses from 0.8 to 1.2 GeV the \u03c0\u03c0 spectral function measured at Belle is below the ALEPH one, see Fig. 4, this effect is compensated by the spectral function behavior at low and high masses, so that the resultant contribution to the hadronic part of the muon anomaly is about the same as before. On the other hand, a recent comprehensive analysis of the e + e \u2212 data below 1 GeV and those on the 2\u03c0 decay of the \u03c4 lepton performed in Ref.

The authors discuss the possibility that the observed discrepancy between the experimental measurement of a \u00b5 and its theoretical prediction may be due to hypothetical errors in the determination of the leading-order hadronic contribution. In particular, they show that if one tries to solve the problem by increasing the low energy e + e \u2212 cross section by an amount necessary to bridge the discrepancy, this affects the hadronic contribution to the running fine-structure con- stant decreasing the electroweak upper bound on the Higgs mass. As a result, it leaves a very narrow window for the Higgs mass. They also showed that this scenario would require a serious revision of the e + e \u2212 cross section, which seems unlikely at the current level of experimental accuracy. What is the future of this SM test? From the experimental side there are suggestions to improve the accuracy by a factor of 2.5 at E969 (BNL) or even by an order of magnitude at JPARC. It is clear that it will be extremely difficult to improve significantly the existing accuracy of the leading-order hadronic contribution by measuring the cross section of e + e \u2212 annihilation to better than 0.3% as required by future determinations of a \u00b5 mentioned above. One can optimistically expect substantial progress from new high-statistics ISR measurements at KLOE, BaBar and Belle together with the more precise determination of R below 4-5 GeV from CLEO-c [ 64] and BES-III [ 65]. Experiments are planned at the new machine VEPP-2000 now commissioning, which is a VEPP-2M upgrade up to \u221a s=2 GeV with L max = 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , with two detectors (CMD-3 and SND) [ 66]. A similar machine (DA\u03a6NE-II) is discussed in Frascati [ 67]. We can estimate that by 2010 the accuracy of a had,LO \u00b5 will be improved from 4.4\u202210 \u221210 by a factor of about 2 (to \u223c 2.2 \u2022 10 \u221210 ) and the total error of 4.1 \u2022 10 \u221210 will be limited by the LBL term (3.5 \u2022 10 \u221210 ), still higher than the expected 2.5 \u2022 10 \u221210 in E969.",

Improvement of e + e \u2212 data (BaBar, BES, CMD-2, KLOE and SND) led to substantial decrease of the a had,LO \u00b5 uncertainty. For the first time the accuracy of the theoretical prediction is better than that of the experimental measurement. Future experiments as well as development of theory should clarify whether the observed difference between a exp \u00b5 and a th \u00b5 is real and what consequences for the Standard Model and for possible New Physics [ 72] it implies.
