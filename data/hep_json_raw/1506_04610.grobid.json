Assuming a chondritic Th/U mass ratio of 3.9, we obtain 23.7 +6.5   \u22125.7 (stat) +0.9 \u22120.6 (sys) geo-neutrino events. The null observation of geo-neutrinos with Borexino alone has a probability of 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 (5.9\u03c3). A geo-neutrino signal from the mantle is obtained at 98% C.L. The radiogenic heat production for U and Th from the present best-fit result is restricted to the range 23-36 TW, taking into account the uncertainty on the distribution of heat producing elements inside the Earth.",

            "text": "Geo-neutrinos are electron anti-neutrinos (\u03bd e ) produced by \u03b2 decays of long-lived isotopes, which are naturally present in the interior of the Earth, such as decays in the 238 U and 232 Th chains, and 40 K [1,2]. Geo-\u03bd e measurements have been reported by Borexino [3,4] and KamLAND [5,6]. Here we present improved reactor neutrino and geo-\u03bd e measurements performed by Borexino. Borexino is an unsegmented liquid scintillator detector in operation at the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory, Italy [9]. In liquid scintillator detectors\u03bd e are detected via the inverse \u03b2 decay process,\u03bd e +p \u2192 e + +n, with a threshold of 1.806 MeV. The deposited\u03bd e energy results in a prompt signal induced by the positron, and includes annihilation photons. The visible energy is related to the\u03bd e energy as E vis = E\u03bd e \u2212 0.784 MeV. A delayed signal induced by the neutron capture on protons produces the 2.22 MeV gamma-ray, providing a delayed coincidence signal with a mean capture time of 259.7\u00b11.3(stat)\u00b12.0(syst) \u00b5s [8]. In Borexino 278 tons of ultra-pure organic liquid scintillator (pseudocumene doped with 1.5 g/l of diphenyloxazole) is confined within a thin, spherical nylon inner vessel (IV) with a nominal radius of 4.25 m and concentrically placed inside a stainless steel sphere (SSS) with radius of 13.7 m and equipped with 2212 8\" photomultipliers (PMTs). The volume between the SSS and the IV, divided in two regions by a second outer nylon vessel (OV) is filled with 890 tons of pseudocumene with 3 g/l of light quencher dimethylphthalate to shield the core of the detector against \u03b3 radiation and radon from the PMTs and the SSS. The SSS is immersed in an water tank (WT) instrumented with 208 PMTs as a\u010cerenkov active muon veto, also acting as an shield against \u03b3-rays and and neutrons from the surrounding rock.",

            "text": "The data reported here were collected between December 15, 2007 and March 8, 2015 for a total of 2055.9 days before any selection cut. The number of PMTs for the present data set has been declining with time, from 1931 to 1525 (average 1730), with small run by run fluctuations. As reported in [3] the event energy is a calibrated non-linear function of the number of detected p.e. We perform the analysis directly in number of p.e. We discard events occurring within 2 ms of every muon crossing the outer detector and within 2 s of muons crossing the inner detector to reject neutrons and long-lived cosmogenic radioactivity, respectively. This cut reduces the live-time to 1841.9 days. We apply the following additional selection cuts: (1) prompt scintillation light: Q p > 408 p.e. (i.e. 1.022 MeV corrected for the energy resolution); (2) delayed signal scintillation light: 860 < Q d < 1300 p.e. (neutron capture peak) ; (3) correlation distance between prompt and delayed signals: \u2206R < 1m; (4) correlated time between prompt and delayed signals: 20 < \u2206t < 1280 \u00b5s; (5) pulse shape discrimination with Gatti filter [11]: g \u03b1\u03b2 < 0.015 for delayed signals; (6) multiplicity cut: selected event are neither preceded or followed by neutron-like events within a 2 ms window; (7) dynamical fiducial volume [10]: every prompt signal has a reconstructed vertex >30 cm away from the timevarying IV surface; (8) FADC cut: independent check of candidate events features by a 400 MHz digitizer acquisition system. The combined efficiency of the cuts is determined by Monte Carlo to be (84.2\u00b11.5)%. The total efficiency-corrected exposure for the present data set is 907\u00b144 ton\u00d7yr. We have identified 77\u03bd e candidates passing all the selection cuts. The probability of\u03bd e -mimicking background events leaking into the dataset was evaluated as follows: 1The rate of accidental coincidences has been searched for by shifting the delayed time window to 2-20 seconds and keeping all other cuts unchanged. The energy spectrum of these events is limited to <3 MeV. (2) Time correlated events have been searched for in the (2 ms, 2 s) time window. A negligible amount of correlated events with a \u223c1 s time constant were identified and their contribution in the\u03bd e time window determined. (3) (\u03b1,n) background for \u03bd e search has been extensively discussed elsewhere [3][4][5][6][7]. The average rate of 210 Po in the dataset is determined to be (14.1\u00b10.2) counts/(day\u2022ton). (4) Cosmogenic radioactive isotopes which decay via \u03b2+n, namely 9 Li-8 He [8], have been studied in the (2 ms, 2 s) time window after a muon crossing the inner detector. These events have a wide energy spectrum with maximum at \u223c5 MeV. 5222 Rn in the liquid scintillator can produce background events through time-correlated \u03b2 +(\u03b1+\u03b3) decays of 214 Bi and 214 Po. This decay sequence has a time constant close to the neutron capture time following a\u03bd e interaction. This background has been estimated by individually tagging 214 Bi-214 Po decays. (6) Backgrounds from fast neutrons, untagged muons and spontaneous fission decays in the PMTs are the same as in previous papers [3,4]. Table I summarizes the estimated backgrounds for \u03bd e candidates, expressed in number of events. The combined upper limit is obtained by Monte Carlo. The\u03bd e signal-to-background ratio is \u223c100.",

The range of values includes the uncertainty on the distribution of heat producing elements inside the Earth. The model-independent analysis yields a radiogenic heat interval 11-52 TW (69% C.L.) for H(U + T h). Adopting the chondritic mass ratio above and a potassium-to-uranium mass ratio m(K)/m(U ) = 10 4 , the total measured terrestrial radiogenic power is P (U + T h + K) = 33 +28 \u221220 TW, to be compared with the global terrestrial power output P tot = 47 \u00b1 2 TW [15]. The contribution to the total geo-neutrino signal from the local crust (LOC) is estimated to be S geo (LOC) = (9.7\u00b11.3) TNU [16]. Considering the contribution from the rest of the crust (ROC) [17], the signal from the crust in Borexino is calculated as S geo (LOC+ROC) = (23.4\u00b12.8) TNU. In order to estimate the significance of a positive signal from the mantle we have determined the likelihood of S geo (M antle) = S geo \u2212 S geo (LOC+ROC) using the experimental likelihood profile of S geo and a gaussian approximation for the crust contribution. The non-physical region, S geo (M antle) < 0, is excluded. This approach gives a signal from the mantle equal to S geo (M antle) = 20.9 +15.1 \u221210.3 TNU, with the null hypothesis rejected at 98% C.L..",
