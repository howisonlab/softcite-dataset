Using a sample of approximately 117 000 signal decays with an invariant K + K \u2212 mass in the vicinity of the \u03c6(1020) resonance, the CP-violating phase \u03c6 s is measured, along with the difference in decay widths of the light and heavy mass eigenstates of the B 0 s -B 0 s system, s .

Finally, the results are combined with recent results from B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays obtained using the same dataset as this analysis, and with previous independent LHCb results.",

            "text": "The existence of new phenomena beyond those predicted by the Standard Model (SM), hereafter referred to as New Physics (NP), could introduce sizeable effects on CP-violating observables. In the SM, CP violation originates from an irreducible complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix that describes the mixing of the mass and weak interaction eigenstates of the quarks [1,2]. In decays of a B 0 s meson to a CP eigenstate, CP violation can originate from the interference of the amplitude of the decay and that of the adjoint decay preceded by B 0 s -B 0 s oscillation. It manifests itself through a nonzero value of the phase \u03c6 s = \u2212arg (\u03bb), where the parameter \u03bb \u2261 arg (q/ p) A/A describes CP violation in the interference between mixing and decay. Here, A and A are the amplitudes for a B 0 s or a B 0 s meson to decay to the same final state and the complex parameters p = B 0 s |B L and q = B 0 s |B L describe the relation between the flavour and the mass eigenstates, light, L, and heavy, H. The two eigenstates have a decay width difference s \u2261 L \u2212 H and a mass difference m s \u2261 m H \u2212 m L . In the absence of CP violation in the decay and assuming negligible CP violation in B 0 s -B 0 s mixing [3], |\u03bb| is expected to be unity. In the SM, ignoring subleading contributions, the phase \u03c6 s can be related to the CKM matrix elements",

            "text": "Due to its high yield and clean experimental signature, the most sensitive decay channel to NP contributions is B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )K + K \u2212 [8], where the kaon pair predominantly originates from the decay of a \u03c6(1020) resonance 1 . Angular momentum conservation in the decay implies that the final state is an admixture of CP-even and CP-odd components, with orbital angular momentum of 0 or 2, and 1, respectively. Moreover, along with the three polarisation states of the \u03c6 meson (P-wave states), there is also a CP-odd K + K \u2212 component in an S-wave state [9]. The data can therefore be described considering four polarisation amplitudes A g = |A g |e \u2212i\u03b4 g , where the indices g \u2208 {0, , \u22a5, S} refer to the longitudinal, transverse-parallel and transverse-perpendicular relative orientations of the linear polarisation vectors of the J/\u03c8 and \u03c6 mesons and S to the single S-wave amplitude, respectively. The CP-even and CP-odd components are disentangled by a decay-timedependent angular analysis, where the angular observables cos \u03b8 K , cos \u03b8 \u03bc and \u03c6 h are defined in the helicity basis as described in Ref. [10]. The polar angle \u03b8 K (\u03b8 \u03bc ) is the angle between the K + (\u03bc + ) momentum and the direction opposite to the B 0 s momentum in the K + K \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) centre-of-mass system and \u03c6 h is the azimuthal angle between the K + K \u2212 and \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay planes. The \u03c6 h angle is defined by a rotation from the K \u2212 side of the K + K \u2212 plane to the \u03bc + side of the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 plane. The rotation is positive in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 direction in the B 0 s rest frame. A decay-time-dependent angular analysis also allows the determination of s , and of the average B 0 s decay width, s \u2261 ( L + H ) /2. In the SM, s and s can be calculated within the framework of the heavy quark expansion (HQE) theory [11][12][13][14][15][16][17], where a perturbative expansion of the amplitudes in inverse powers of the b-quark mass is used to calculate b-hadron observables. The ratio of the average decay width of B 0 s and B 0 mesons, s / d , is usually the preferred observable to compare with experimental measurements as it allows the suppression of common uncertainties in the calculation. The predictions are s = 0.088 \u00b1 0.020 ps \u22121 [18] and s / d = 1.0006 \u00b1 0.0025 [19]. The high precision of the ratio s / d makes it an excellent testing ground for the validity of the HQE [19,20]. In addition, s can provide bounds complementary to those from s / d on quarkhadron duality violation [21].",

The new measurement reported is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016 during Run 2 of LHC operation, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.3 fb \u22121 and 1.6 fb \u22121 , respectively.

The K + \u03c0 \u2212 in the final state originates predominantly from the decay of a K * (892) 0 resonance. The analysis procedure gives access to s \u2212 d rather than s due to the dependence of the time efficiency parametrisation on d . This allows the determination of s \u2212 d with a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainty associated with lifetime-biasing selection requirements compared to the previous measurement.

At the hardware stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse-energy deposit in the calorimeters. A difference with respect to the previous analysis is that all the events passing any of the hardware trigger requirements are accepted. This increases the signal yield by 13% in 2015 and by 7% in 2016 with respect to using the muon system information only. The different signal gain in the two data taking years is due to tighter L0 trigger thresholds employed in the 2015 data. The subsequent software trigger consists of two separate stages. In the first stage, the events can be divided into two categories. In the first category, they are required to have two well-identified oppositely charged muons with invariant mass larger than 2700 MeV/c 2 . This trigger has an almost uniform efficiency as a function of B 0 s decay time and will be referred to as unbiased. In the second category, events are retained if there is at least one muon with transverse momentum larger than about 1 GeV/c and with a large impact-parameter significance with respect to all PVs in the event. The latter is defined as the difference in the vertex-fit \u03c7 2 of the PV fitted with and without the considered track. Events are also included in the second category if they pass the selection by a multivariate algorithm that identifies a twotrack good-quality secondary vertex with a large scalar sum of the p T of the associated charged particles and a significant displacement from the PVs. These triggers, whose selection thresholds changed slightly between 2015 and 2016 data taking, introduce a nontrivial dependence of the efficiency on the B 0 s decay time and will be referred to as biased. In the second stage of the trigger, events containing a \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pair with invariant mass within 120 MeV/c 2 of the J/\u03c8 mass [46] and which form a vertex that is significantly displaced from the PV are selected, introducing another small decay-time bias.",

The J/\u03c8 meson candidates are combined with K + K \u2212 candidates formed from two oppositely charged particles that are identified as kaons and that originate from a common vertex. The K + K \u2212 pair is required to have p T larger than 500 MeV/c. The invariant mass of the K + K \u2212 pair, m(K + K \u2212 ), must be in the range 990-1050 MeV/c 2 . The B 0 s candidates are reconstructed by combining the J/\u03c8 candidate with the K + K \u2212 pair, requiring that they form a good vertex and have an invariant mass, m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ), in the range 5200-5550 MeV/c 2 . The B 0 s origin vertex is defined as the PV in the interaction, or if multiple PVs are reconstructed the PV with the minimum value of the B 0 s impact parameter significance is associated with the candidate. The invariant mass is calculated from a kinematic fit that constrains the B 0 s candidate to originate from its origin vertex and constrains m(\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) to the known J/\u03c8 mass [46]. When deriving the decay time, t, and the helicity angles of the B 0 s candidate the origin vertex constraint is also applied. In addition, t is required to be in the range 0.3-15.0 ps, which suppresses a large fraction of prompt combinatorial background whilst having a negligible effect on the sensitivity to \u03c6 s . The kinematic fit also estimates a per-candidate decay-time uncertainty, \u03b4 t .",

These backgrounds lie around the B 0 s signal peak in the m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ) distribution, as shown in Fig. 1. These contributions are suppressed using more stringent kaon identification requirements if the m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ) mass, with the kaon interpreted as a proton (pion), lies within 15 MeV/c 2 around the \u039b 0 b (B 0 ) known mass [46]. This reduces the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + \u03c0 \u2212 peaking background contribution to approximately 120 decays. This background is neglected and a systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for this approximation. The contribution due to the \u039b 0 b background is 1600 \u00b1 160, where the uncertainty includes statistical and systematic sources. The \u039b 0 b background is statistically subtracted by inserting simulated \u039b 0 b decays into the data sample with negative weights. This is done prior to the sPlot procedure, in which the combinatorial background is subtracted in a fit to m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ). Correlations between the candidate mass and the angular variables are preserved and the simulated candidates are weighted such that the distributions of the kinematic variables used in the fit, and their correlations, match those of data.

The per-candidate mass uncertainty, \u03c3 m , obtained in the vertex and kinematic fit used to obtain m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ), is found to represent a good proxy of cos \u03b8 \u03bc due to its correlation with the B 0 s candidate mass resolution.

A simulated sample of B + decays is used in the calculation of the numerator of Eq. (4) and this sample is corrected such that the particleidentification, event-multiplicity and other kinematic and selection variables match those in data. The measured difference of decay widths is u \u2212 d = \u22120.0478 \u00b1 0.0013 ps \u22121 , where the uncertainty is statistical only. This is in agreement with the world average value, \u22120.0474 \u00b1 0.0023 ps \u22121 [46], and validates the measurement of s \u2212 d with a precision of 0.003 ps \u22121 .",

The points are obtained by dividing the angular distribution in the simulated sample by the distribution expected without any efficiency effect and the curves represent an even fourth-order polynomial parameterisation of each one-dimensional efficiency. The figure is for illustration only as the angular efficiency is accounted for by normalisation weights in the signal PDF for the different years of data taking and for the two trigger categories. Two sets of corrections are applied to the simulated events such that they match the data. First, the simulated samples are weighted, using a boosted decision tree method [53], to match the p T , p and m(K + K \u2212 ) distributions of the B 0 s signal. A second procedure is performed to correct the differences observed in the kinematic distributions of the final-state particles and the fact that the simulated events do not include K + K \u2212 pairs in an S-wave configuration. This correction is implemented as an iterative procedure that gradually modifies the simulation such that the S-wave fraction matches the value measured in the data. As a result, the agreement of the kaon momentum and p T distributions between the simulation and the data is improved. The effi-ciencies as a function of the three helicity angles are shown for illustration in Fig. 6. The angular efficiency correction is introduced in the analysis through normalisation weights in the PDF describing the signal decays in the fit of Sect. 8, following the procedure described in Ref. [54]. The weights are calculated using simulated candidates and their statistical uncertainties are propagated to the parameters of interest as a systematic uncertainty.",

The B + data sample is split into nine disjoint subsets according to the pseudorapidity of the B + meson, to check the large efficiency variation as a function of this quantity. In each subset, background is subtracted with the sPlot technique using the B + candidate mass as a discriminating variable.

However, when the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + simulation is used to correct the data with the same method used for this analysis, a fit of the background-subtracted and efficiency-corrected data demonstrates that the expected distribution is fully recovered in each bin, with an overall precision of about 0.1%.

The same-side kaon (SSK) tagger exploits the additional correlated kaon that tends to be produced during the hadronisation of the b (b) quark that forms the signal B 0 s (B 0 s ) candidate, with its initial flavour identified by the kaon charge. These flavour tagging algorithms have been revisited and optimised using Run 2 data [56], obtaining significantly higher combined tagging performances with respect to Run 1.

The first is due to the statistical uncertainties on the calibration parameters and is found to be negligible. The second is related to the assumption that the resolution model obtained in the calibration sample applies also to the signal sample. The corresponding systematic uncertainty is determined by evaluating the ratio of the calibration effective resolutions, obtained from the simulated samples of the calibration and signal decays, and using it to scale the effective resolutions in the prompt data sample. These scaled effective resolutions are then described by a quadratic function and used to determine the physics parameters. The differences with respect to the baseline result are assigned as systematic uncertainties. A third source of uncertainty is due to a possible bias of the Gaussian resolution mean, which is assumed to be zero in the baseline model. A quadratic dependence of the mean on the decay-time uncertainty is observed in the calibration sample, with a maximum deviation of about 5 fs from zero. It is modelled in the prompt data sample after weighting it in order to match the signal data sample. Correspond-ing systematic uncertainties are evaluated as the differences between the results obtained with this bias and the baseline model. Finally, the fourth systematic effect is estimated by varying the contribution in the fit of candidates with an associated wrong origin vertex. The fraction of these candidates is varied between 0 and 1.5%, corresponding to about three times the fraction that is measured in the calibration sample, the calibration updated and the fit to data repeated.

In addition, the two components are separated by matching the reconstructed daughter particles to the simulated particles by comparing their track momentum magnitudes and directions. The angular efficiency is determined according to these two changes and the larger differences are assigned as systematic uncertainties. Finally, from a fit to several simulated samples of the same size as data, uncertainties are evaluated as the differences between fitted and generated values to account for correlations between the angular efficiency and the decay time as well as the decay-time uncertainty. Such correlations are neglected in the baseline fit. Several sources of systematic uncertainties related to the determination of the spline-based decay-time efficiency are studied and found to be small. First, the effect due to the limited size of the data and simulated samples is estimated by repeating the fit several times with the spline coefficients varied according to their covariance matrix and the RMS of the fitted observable distributions is taken as systematic uncertainties. Two further contributions are evaluated by taking the difference between the baseline fit and alternative fits where the time efficiency is determined without applying either the kinematic or the PDF weighting procedures used to correct the physics parameters of B 0 s and B 0 simulated samples. Next, the number of spline nodes is doubled and found to have a negligible effect on the result. Another systematic uncertainty source is due to the differences observed in decaytime efficiency derived from the simulated samples with s equal to or different from zero.

The Run 1 measurements are combined with the results of this analysis taking into account a covariance matrix that includes the statistical uncertainties with their correlations, and the systematic uncertainties with their correlations, both between the parameters in a single run period and between the two run periods. The sources of systematic uncertainty that are correlated between the analyses are the applicability of the time resolution obtained from the prompt control sample on the signal  sample, the C SP factors, the correction of simulation for the angular efficiency determination, and the length scale. In the case of the angular efficiency, a correlation matrix is determined from the RMS distributions of the parameters in Run 2 and the same matrix is taken to account for correlations between Run 1 and Run 2. For all other sources of systematic uncertainty no correlation is assumed. For the parameters showing asymmetric uncertainties, the larger uncertainty has been used in the combination. It has been verified that using the average of the two asymmetric uncertainties does not change the combination, and that completely ignoring the systematic correlations has a negligible effect. In the Run 1 measurement, s was measured instead of s \u2212 d , hence a linear transformation is taken into account in the combination, constraining d to the known value [32]  ",
