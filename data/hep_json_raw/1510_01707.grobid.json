Predictions of charm meson cross-sections have been made at next-to-leading order using the generalized mass variable flavour number scheme (GMVFNS) [3][4][5][6][7][8] and at fixed order with next-to-leading-log resummation (FONLL) [1,2,[9][10][11][12]. These are based on a factorisation approach, where the cross-sections are calculated as a convolution of three terms: the parton distribution functions of the incoming protons; the partonic hard scattering rate, estimated as a perturbative series in the coupling constant of the strong interaction; and a fragmentation function that parametrises the hadronisation of the charm quark into a -1 -",

Such neutrinos constitute an important background for experiments such as IceCube [15] searching for neutrinos produced from astrophysical sources. The previous measurements from LHCb at \u221a s = 7 TeV [16] permit the evaluation of this background for incoming cosmic rays with energy of 26 PeV. In this paper measurements at \u221a s = 13 TeV are presented, probing a new kinematic region that corresponds to a primary cosmic ray energy of 90 PeV. Measurements of the charm production cross-sections have been performed in different kinematic regions and centre-of-mass energies. Measurements by the CDF experiment cover the central rapidity region |y| < 1 and transverse momenta, p T , between 5.5 GeV/c and 20 GeV/c at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV in pp collisions [17]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), charm cross-sections in pp collisions have been measured in the |y| < 0.5 region for p T > 1 GeV/c at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV by the ALICE experiment [18][19][20]. The LHCb experiment has recorded the world's largest dataset of charm hadrons to date and this has led to numerous high-precision measurements of their production and decay properties. LHCb measured the cross-sections in the forward region 2.0 < y < 4.5 for 0 < p T < 8 GeV/c at \u221a s = 7 TeV [16].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger. This consists of a hardware stage, which for this analysis randomly selects a pre-defined fraction of all beam-beam crossings, followed by a software stage. This analysis benefits from a new scheme for the LHCb software trigger introduced for LHC Run 2. Alignment and calibration is performed in near real-time [23] and updated constants are made available for the trigger. The same alignment and calibration information is propagated to the offline reconstruction, ensuring consistent and high-quality particle identification (PID) information between the trigger and offline software. The larger timing budget available in the trigger compared to LHCb Run 1 also results in the convergence of the online and offline track reconstruction, such that offline performance is achieved in the trigger. The identical performance of the online and offline reconstruction offers the opportunity to perform physics analyses directly using candidates reconstructed in the trigger [24]. The storage of only the triggered candidates enables a reduction in the event size by an order of magnitude.",

The number of prompt signal charm meson decays within each (p T , y) bin is determined with fits to the ln \u03c7 2 IP distribution of the selected samples. These fits are carried out in a signal window in the invariant mass of the candidates and background templates are obtained from regions outside the signal window.

The statistical uncertainties of these efficiencies are propagated to obtain systematic uncertainties on the cross-sections. In the weighting procedure, it is assumed that the PID efficiencies for all candidates in a given bin are identical. A systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for deviations from this approximation by sampling from kernel density estimates [38] created from the calibration samples, and recomputing the total PID efficiency with the sampled data using a progressively finer binning. The efficiency converges to a value that is offset from the value measured with the nominal binning. This deviation is assigned as a systematic uncertainty on the PID efficiency.

Integrated cross-sections (black diamonds), their average (black circle and blue band) and theory predictions (red squares) [1,2] are shown (left) based on the D 0 and D + for 0 < p T < 8 GeV/c and (right) for measurements based on all four mesons for 1 < p T < 8 GeV/c. The \"absolute\" predictions are based on calculations of the 13 TeV cross-section, while the \"scaled\" predictions are based on calculations of the 13 to 7 TeV ratio multiplied with the LHCb measurement at 7 TeV [16]. . To produce this improved set, the authors of ref. [1] weight the NNPDF3.0 NLO set in order to match FONLL calculations to LHCb's charm cross-section measurements at 7 TeV [16]. This results in a significant improvement in the uncertainties for the gluon distribution function at small momentum fraction x. Two predictions for the integrated cross-section are provided, one an absolute calculation, identical to that for the differential cross-sections, and the other scaled from the 7 TeV measurement. The GMVFNS calculations include theoretical predictions for all mesons studied in this analysis. Results are provided for 3 < p T < 30 GeV/c. Here the CT10 [47] set of parton distributions is used. The GMVFNS theoretical framework includes the convolution with fragmentation functions describing the transition c \u2192 H c that are normalised to the respective total transition probabilities [7,48]. The fragmentation functions are taken from a fit to production measurements at e + e \u2212 colliders, where no attempt is made to separate direct production and feed-down from higher resonances.",

The central values of the measurements generally lie above those of the theory predictions, albeit within the uncertainties provided. For the POWHEG+NNPDF3.0L and FONLL predictions, the data generally lie at the upper edge of the uncertainty band. The GMVFNS predictions provide the best description of the data, although the cross-sections decrease with p T at a higher rate than the data near their low p T limit of 3 GeV/c. Similar behaviour is observed for the \u221a s = 7 TeV measurement [16], where only central values are shown for the FONLL prediction, which give lower cross-sections than the data. The GMVFNS predictions again show good agreement, and again exhibit a higher rate as p T approaches 3 GeV/c. The data are consistently above the predictions for the ratios of cross-sections at \u221a s = 13 TeV and 7 TeV, shown in figure 7. In combination with the good agreement at 7 TeV, this indicates that the level of agreement worsenes with the increase in collision energy. A trend across the LHCb acceptance emerges, especially for the D 0 ratio: the agreement worsens with increasing rapidity for low p T while it improves with increasing rapidity for high p T . The absolute predictions for the integrated cross-sections show agreement with data within their large uncertainties, with central values below the measurements. The scaled POWHEG+NNPDF3.0L prediction, which has smaller uncertainties than the absolute prediction, does not agree with the data. The measurements are consistent with a linear scaling of the cross-section with the collision energy.",
