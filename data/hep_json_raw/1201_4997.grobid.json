The search is performed in the dileptonic final states ee/e\u00b5/\u00b5\u00b5 with a selection based on kinematical properties and b-tagging information. The contribution of the Z+jets processes to the background is estimated from a sideband in data. Two tt dominated control regions are used to constrain the normalization of top quark pair production in the signal region. An excess of events over the expected background is observed. Assigning this excess to events from tW production, the extracted tW cross section is in agreement with the Standard Model expectation.",

A contributing leading-order Feynman diagram is shown in Fig.  1 (a). At next-to-leading order, real contributions with an additional bottom quark in the final state lead to ambiguities in the conceptual distinction between the tW process and top quark pair production, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Two possibilities to resolve this ambiguity [1] have been considered: in the diagram removal method, all diagrams which can also arise in top quark pair production are removed for the calculation. This is used as default scheme for the simulation used in this analysis. The second possibility is the diagram subtraction method which locally subtracts resonant contributions. The difference between these two methods is considered as a systematic uncertainty.",
