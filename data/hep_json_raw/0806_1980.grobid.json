            "text": "In the standard model (SM), a mostly left (right)handed photon emitted from a B 0 (B 0 ) meson is expected in the b \u2192 s\u03b3 transition. Hence a small timedependent CP asymmetry is predicted in decays of the type B \u2192 f CP \u03b3 [1], where f CP is a CP eigenstate. New Physics (NP) may lead to deviations from the SM expectation by introducing different photon polarizations in the transition, and can be probed via experimental measurements of CP violation parameters [2]. In multibody final states B 0 \u2192 P 0 Q 0 \u03b3 with P 0 and Q 0 being C eigenstates, the same argument holds [3]. Measurements of the time-dependent CP asymmetry in B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03b3 have been reported by Belle and BaBar based on 535 and 431 million BB pairs [4,5], respectively. In this paper, based on 657 million BB pairs collected with the Belle detector [6] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [7], we report the measurement of CP -violation parameters on a new channel B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c1 0 \u03b3 where the B 0 decay vertex can be reconstructed from two charged pions from the \u03c1 0 decays.",
