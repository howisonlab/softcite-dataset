After careful study of the accelerator optics and the detector alignment, |t|, the square of four-momentum transferred in the elastic scattering process, has been determined with an uncertainty of \u03b4t = 0.1 GeV p |t|. In this letter, first results of the differential cross-section are presented covering a |t|-range from 0.36 to 2.5 GeV 2 . The differential cross-section in the range 0.36 < |t| < 0.47 GeV 2 is described by an exponential with a slope parameter B = (23.6 \u00b1 0.5 stat \u00b1 0.4 syst ) GeV \u22122 , followed by a significant diffractive minimum at |t| = (0.53 \u00b1 0.01 stat \u00b1 0.01 syst ) GeV 2 . For |t|-values larger than \u223c 1.5 GeV 2 , the cross-section exhibits a power law behaviour with an exponent of \u22127.8 \u00b1 0.3 stat \u00b1 0.1 syst . When compared to predictions based on the different available models, the data show a strong discriminative power despite the small t-range covered.",

Increasing |t| means looking deeper into the proton. Depending on t, the amplitudes from different scattering processes contribute to the differential cross-section d\u03c3/dt: from Coulomb scattering at very small |t| to non-perturbative nuclear scattering and -after a particularly interesting transition range at intermediate |t|to perturbative nuclear scattering at high |t|. Early measurements [1,2] made almost 40 years ago at the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at energies between 23 GeV and 63 GeV revealed a peculiar structure for d\u03c3/dt. At low |t| \u223c (0.01-0.5) GeV 2 (already dominated by nuclear scattering), the differential pp cross-section showed an approximately exponential behaviour, e \u2212B |t| , where B is the slope parameter, followed by a diffractive minimum (the \"dip\"), at |t| \u2248 1.4 GeV 2 , and subsequently a broad peak. Inpp scattering [3][4][5][6][7] the dip is replaced by a shoulder at approximately the same |t| position where the pp data have the minimum. At larger |t|, d\u03c3/dt for pp was found to decrease according to |t| \u2212n with n \u2248 8 [8].",
