            "text": "Since the discovery of the Higgs boson [1][2][3], its properties have been measured and compared to the standard model (SM) prediction [4][5][6][7][8][9]. However, the coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson remains to be determined. Although it appears indirectly through loops in the gluon-gluon fusion production process and in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay channel, a direct measurement has yet to be completed. One of the most promising channels for a direct measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling in the SM is the production of the Higgs boson in association with a tt pair (ttH), where the Higgs boson decays to bb, thus leading to a ttbb final state. This final state, which has not been observed yet [10], has an irreducible nonresonant background from the production of a top quark pair in association with a b quark pair produced via gluon splitting (g \u2192 bb).",

The NNPDF3.0 [25] set of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) is used. The MadGraph (v5.1.5.11) event generator [26] with MEs at leading order (LO), allowing up to three additional partons, including b quarks, and the Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo (v2.2.2) event generator [27] are both used for cross-checks and studies of systematic uncertainties. The tt samples are normalized to the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) cross section calculation [28]. The W+jets and Z/\u03b3 * +jets processes are simulated in MadGraph5_amc@nlo and are normalized to their NNLO cross sections [29]. The single top quark associated production with a W boson (pp \u2192 tW and pp \u2192tW) is simulated in the five-flavour scheme in powheg (v1) at NLO and normalized to an approximate NNLO cross section calculation [30], while the t-channel single top quark events are simulated in the fourflavour scheme in MadGraph5_amc@nlo. The multijet production is modelled in pythia with LO MEs. The CMS detector response is simulated using Geant4 (v9.4) [31]. The events in simulation include the effects of additional interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) and are weighted according to the vertex distribution observed in data. The number of pileup interactions in data is estimated from the measured bunch-to-bunch instantaneous luminosity and the total inelastic cross section [32].",

The cross section ratio has been measured in a visible phase space region using the dilepton decay mode of tt events and corrected to the particle level, corresponding to the detector acceptance. The measured cross section ratios in the visible and the full phase space are \u03c3 ttbb /\u03c3 ttjj = 0.024 \u00b1 0.003 (stat) \u00b1 0.007 (syst) and \u03c3 ttbb /\u03c3 ttjj = 0.022 \u00b1 0.003 (stat) \u00b1 0.006 (syst), respectively, where a minimum transverse momentum for the particle-level jets of 20 GeV is required. The ttH contribution, being negligible, is not removed from data. Theoretical ratios predicted from the powheg simulation (interfaced with pythia) are 0.014 \u00b1 0.001 for the visible and 0.012 \u00b1 0.001 for the full phase space, which are lower than the measured values but consistent within two standard deviations. The individual cross sections \u03c3 ttbb = 4.0 \u00b1 0.6 (stat) \u00b1 1.3 (syst) pb and \u03c3 ttjj = 184 \u00b1 6 (stat) \u00b1 33 (syst) pb have also been measured. These results, in particular the ratio of the cross sections, provide important information for the ttH search, permitting the reduction of a dominant systematic uncertainty that derives from the uncertainty in the ttbb background. They can also be used as a figure of merit for testing the validity of next-to-leading-order QCD calculations at",

The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates in the event. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . In the same-flavour channels, remaining backgrounds from Z+jets processes are suppressed by demanding p miss T > 30 GeV. For the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 channel, no p miss T requirement is applied.",
