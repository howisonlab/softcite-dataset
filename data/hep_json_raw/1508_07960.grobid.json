The lowest-order SM processes contributing to these decays are the photon penguin, the Z penguin and the W + W \u2212 box diagrams shown in Fig. 1. Their amplitudes are expressed in terms of hadronic form factors and perturbatively-calculable effective Wilson coefficients, C eff 7 , C eff 9 and C eff 10 , which represent the electromagnetic penguin diagram, and the vector part and the axial-vector part of the linear combination of the Z penguin and W + W \u2212 box diagrams, respectively [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Non-SM physics may add new penguin and/or box diagrams, as well as possible contributions from new scalar, pseudoscalar, and/or tensor currents, which can contribute at the same order as the SM diagrams, modifying the effective Wilson coefficients from their SM expectations [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. An example of a non-SM physics loop process is shown in Fig. 2; other possible processes could involve e.g., non-SM Higgs, charginos, gauginos, neutralinos and/or squarks.

At any particular q 2 value, the kinematic distribution of the decay products of B \u2192 K * \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and the CPconjugate B \u2192 K * \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 process depends on six transversity amplitudes which, neglecting CP -violating effects and terms of order m 2 \u2113 and higher, can be expressed as a triply differential cross-section in three angles: \u03b8 K , the angle between the K and the B directions in the K * rest frame; \u03b8 \u2113 , the angle between the \u2113 + (\u2113 \u2212 ) and the B(B) direction in the \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 rest frame; and \u03c6, the angle between the \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 and K\u03c0 decay planes in the B rest frame. From the distribution of the angle \u03b8 K obtained after integrating over \u03c6 and \u03b8 \u2113 , we determine the K * longitudinal polarization fraction F L using a fit to cos \u03b8 K of the form [6]  We similarly determine the lepton forward-backward asymmetry A F B from the distribution of the angle \u03b8 \u2113 obtained after integrating over \u03c6 and \u03b8 K , [6] ",

We then fix these parameters at their central values for the angular fits. To study the systematic uncertainty associated with these fixed parameters, we vary each parameter from its central value by its \u00b11\u03c3 statistical uncertainty, accounting for correlations among the fit parameters, and then redo the angular fit. To control for systematic fit results that deviate from the nominal central value mainly from statistical effects rather than systematic ones, we additionally examine fit results obtained from \u00b1(0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2)\u03c3 variations. These small variations on the \u00b11\u03c3 values should also result in similarly small variations, in the absence of any statistical effects, on a \u00b11\u03c3 systematic fit result. For the bulk of the systematics, where the series of fit results for each of the additional variations is linearly distributed around the middle 1\u03c3 fit result, the 1\u03c3 variation is considered robust. In the relatively few cases where the disagreement between the nominal 1\u03c3 variation and the value of the 1\u03c3 variation interpolated from the additional (0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2)\u03c3 variations is statistically significant, the interpolated 1\u03c3 value is used to assign the systematic. All deviations from the nominal fit central value are then added in quadrature to obtain the overall systematic uncertainty attributable to this source, which is given in Table VI. The cos \u03b8 K fit yields the central value and statistical uncertainty for F L in each q 2 bin, which is subsequently used in the fit to the cos \u03b8 \u2113 distributions to extract A F B . To study the systematic uncertainty on A F B due to the purely statistical F L uncertainty, we vary the value of F L by \u00b11\u03c3 from its fitted value, and redo the cos \u03b8 \u2113 fits with the new value of F L . We determine the systematic uncertainty from the shift in the central value of A F B relative to the nominal fit for \u00b11\u03c3 variations of F L ; these are given in Table VII. As with the variations described in the preceding paragraph, additional fits for several F L variations surrounding the nominal \u00b11\u03c3 values are performed. We then apply the same quality criterion as for the preceding systematic and, where this criterion is not met, assign the F L systematic using an interpolated 1\u03c3 value rather than the fitted 1\u03c3 variation.",

These datasets are used to produce signal efficiency histograms differing from the default ones, which use the expected SM values for the Wilson coefficients. This allows different regions of the angular distributions to contribute with different relative weight depending on the magnitude and sign of the underlying angular asymmetries. Applying these alternative signal efficiency histograms, we measure the shifts in the fitted values of F L and A F B , and assign as the systematic the sum-in-quadrature of each deviation from the nominal central value; the resulting systematic uncertainty is shown in Table IX.",

Results for the B + \u2192 K * + \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 final state are presented for the first time here. Fig. 7 graphically shows our F L and A F B results in disjoint q 2 bins alongside other published results and the SM theory expectations, the latter of which typically have 5-10% theory uncertainties in the regions below and above the charmonium resonances. Fig. 8 similarly compares the q 2 0 results obtained here with those of other experiments and the SM theory expectation. As shown in these figures, our B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 results are in reasonable agreement with both SM theory expectations and other experimental results. Similarly, although with relatively larger uncertainties, we observe broad agreement of the B + \u2192 K * + \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 results with those for B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 . However, in the low dilepton mass-squared region, we observe relatively very small values for F L in B + \u2192 K * + \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 , exhibiting tension with both the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 results as well as the SM expectations. These tensions in F L are difficult to interpret because of uncertainties due to form-factor contributions in the calculation of this observable in both the SM and NP scenarios. However, as shown in Fig. 9 in the same mass-squared region, there is also tension between the experimental results and the expected SM value for P 2 , an observable explicitly constructed to minimize such uncertainties. In particular, our P 2 results in q 2 2 are consistent with the existence of substantial right-hand current contributions [40].",
