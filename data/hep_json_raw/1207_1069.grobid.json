            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, with a mass about 40 times larger than the mass of its isospin partner, the bottom quark. It decays almost 100% of the time to a W boson and a bottom quark. Using top-antitop pairs at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, the CDF and D0 collaborations have measured the top quark's mass in different final states for integrated luminosities of up to 5.8 fb \u22121 . This paper reports on a combination of these measurements that results in a more precise value of the mass than any individual decay channel can provide. It describes the treatment of the systematic uncertainties and their correlations. The mass value determined is 173.18 \u00b1 0.56 (stat) \u00b1 0.75 (syst) GeV or 173.18 \u00b1 0.94 GeV, which has a precision of \u00b10.54%, making this the most precise determination of the top quark mass.

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics describes the elementary particles and their interactions. The top quark (t) has a special place in the hierarchy of particles because it is far more massive than any of the other fundamental objects. It is the up-type quark, partnered with the down-type bottom quark (b), forming the third generation of quarks which was predicted by Kobayashi and Maskawa in 1973  [1] to accomodate CP violation in neutral kaon decays [2]. At particle colliders the top quark is produced mainly in top-antitop (tt) pairs. First evidence of top quark production was reported by the CDF collaboration [3] and the top quark was first observed in this production mode by the CDF [4] and D0 [5] collaborations at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. Since then, great efforts have been focused on measuring its properties with ever higher precision. In addition to its large mass (m t ), the top quark is also singular because it decays before it can hadronize: there are no mesons or baryons containing valence top quarks. The top quark decays almost exclusively to a W boson and a b quark, with the fraction determined by the near-unity value of the CKM quark mixing matrix [1,6] element V tb (\u2248 0.9992) [7]. Its other decays are limited by the small values of V ts \u2248 0.0387 and V td \u2248 0.0084 [7], assuming three-family unitarity of the CKM matrix. The W boson decays to a charged lepton and its associated neutrino, or to a quark-antiquark pair, and the final states of tt events are thus characterized as: \"lepton+jets\" (tt \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bdbqq \u2032b andqq \u2032 b\u2113 \u2212\u03bdb ); \"alljets\" (tt \u2192 qq \u2032 bqq \u2032b ), and \"dileptons\" (tt \u2192 \u2113 + \u03bdb\u2113 \u2212\u03bdb ). In this notation the charged lepton \u2113 represents an electron or muon, and q is a first-or second-generation quark. The W boson also decays to a \u03c4 lepton and a \u03c4 neutrino. If the \u03c4 decays to an electron or muon, the event contributes to the lepton categories, and if the \u03c4 decays into hadrons, it contributes to the lepton+jets or alljets categories. A fourth category labelled \" E T +jets\" is used to measure m t when there are jets and a large imbalance in transverse momentum in the event ( E T ), but no identified lepton. It comprises tt \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bdb\u03c4 \u2212\u03bdb , \u03c4 + \u03bdbqq \u2032b , andqq \u2032 b\u03c4 \u2212\u03bdb final states, accounting for 40% of the tt signal events in the E T +jets category, or \u2113 + \u03bdbqq \u2032b ,qq \u2032 b\u2113 \u2212\u03bdb , where the electron or muon are not reconstructed, accounting for 60% of the tt signal in this category. Additional contributions to E T arise from the neutrino(s) produced in \u03c4 decays.",

In lepton+jets events, there are typically four jets, including two b jets and two light-quark jets from W -boson decay. Alljets events most often contain six jets, the two b jets and four light-quark jets. The E T +jets events usually have four or five jets. Additional gluon or quark jets can arise due to radiation from initial or final state colored particles, including the top quarks. About 23% of the tt events have an extra jet with sufficient energy to pass the selection criteria and about 5% of the events have two additional jets. These extra jets complicate the measurement of m t and degrade its resolution. At the Tevatron collider, the qq channel contributes 81% to the total tt inclusive cross section and the gg channel the remaining 19% [8,9]. The dilepton modes (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5) have a combined branching fraction of \u2248 4%, the electron+jets and muon+jets modes combined correspond to \u2248 30%, and the alljets mode has a branching fraction of \u2248 46%. The \u03c4 modes are shared among the ET +jets and the other channels in the analyses.",

            "text": "One of the fundamental properties of an elementary particle is its mass. In the SM, fermions acquire mass through interactions with the Higgs field [10]. Absolute values of these masses are not predicted by the SM. In theoretical calculations, a particle's mass can be defined in more than one way, and it depends on how higherorder terms in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations are renormalized. In the modified minimal subtraction scheme (MS), for example, the mass definition reflects short-distance effects, whereas in the pole-mass scheme the mass definition reflects longdistance effects [11]. The concept of the pole mass is not well defined since color confinement does not provide Smatrix poles at m = m t [12]. Direct mass measurements that are inputs to the combination described in this paper rely on Monte Carlo (MC) generators to extract m t . Hence the measured mass corresponds in fact to the mass parameter in the MC. Work is proceeding to address the exact difference between the measured mass and the pole mass, as presented for example in Appendix C of Ref. [13]. One alternative way to address this problem is to extract m t from a measurement of the tt cross section [14]. The D0 collaboration has recently shown that the directly measured mass of the top quark is closer to the pole mass extracted from a measurement of the tt cross section than to an MS mass extracted in a similar way [14]. Hence, within the precision of theory and data, the directly measured m t is best interpreted as the topquark pole mass.",

Therefore, the longitudinal and transverse momentum components of the neutrinos can not be determined without the application of more sophisticated tools.

In the first method, the reconstructed mass distribution in data, or a variable correlated with m t , such as the decay length of the B hadron or the transverse momentum of a lepton, is compared to template distributions composed of contributions from background and simulation of tt events. One template is used to represent background and another for each putative value of m t . The second method uses event probabilities based on the LO matrix element for the production of tt. For each event, a probability is calculated as a function of m t that this event is from tt production, as based on the corresponding production and decay matrix element. Detector resolution is taken into account in the calculation of these probabilities through transfer functions that correlate parton-level energies and their measured values. The value of m t is then extracted from the joint probability calculated for all selected events, based on the probability for signal and background (also defined through its matrix element).

At times, more than one measurement is published using the same data and decay channel. In this situation, the result with smallest overall uncertainty is chosen for the combination. Twelve measurements are used in the combination described here, eight from the CDF collaboration and four from D0. These comprise five lepton+jets measurements (CDF and D0, Run II and Run I, and a CDF Run II result based on the decay length of B hadrons); two alljets measurements (CDF Run II and Run I); four dilepton measurements (CDF and D0, Run II and Run I); and a E T +jets measurement (CDF Run II). We combine these measurements using an analytic method called the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) [34][35][36]. This technique forms a linear combination of the separate unbiased mass measurements to produce the best estimate of m t with the smallest uncertainty. This procedure follows a series of 11 such mass combinations presented in [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47], updated each year since 2004 as new measurements of m t became available.

CDF sets the event generation factorization and renormalization scales Q 2 to m 2 t + p 2 \u22a5 + (P 2 1 + P 2 2 )/2, where p \u22a5 is the transverse momentum characterizing the scattering process, and P 2 1 and P 2 2 are the virtualities of the incoming partons. D0 sets the scales to m 2 t + p 2 T , where p 2 T is the average of the square of transverse momentum of all other light partons produced in association with the tt pair. The pythia model treats each step of the tt decay chain (t\u2192W b, W \u2192\u2113\u03bd or qq \u2032 ) separately and does not preserve spin correlations. alpgen uses exact matrix elements for each step and thereby correctly describes the spin information of the final-state partons. The fragments of the proton and antiproton or \"underlying event\" are added separately to each hard collision. CDF uses the \"Tune A\" settings [73] in pythia while D0 uses a modified version of the tune. Both collaborations use angular ordering for modeling parton-showering in pythia, and not p T -ordered models. The underlying event is therefore not interleaved with the parton showers as in models of color reconnection [74].",

As B hadrons have a mean lifetime of \u2248 10 \u221212 seconds, b jets can be tagged through secondary vertices of the B decay a few mm away from the primary pp interaction. CDF's b-tagging algorithm uses the significance of the displacement of the secondary vertex in the transverse (r, \u03c6) plane for the lepton+jets and E T +jets channels [59], as well as a jet-probability algorithm for E T +jets events [63]. One parameter defines the significance of the separation of the primary and secondary vertices for events with one and two b jets. For jets that are within the acceptance of the silicon microstrip tracker (i.e., \"taggable\" jets), this algorithm identifies 50% of real b jets and 9% of real charm jets, while falsely tagging 1% of light jets. D0 tags jets by combining nine track and secondary-vertex-related variables using a neural network [62]. For jets within the acceptance of the silicon microstrip detector, this yields efficiencies of 65% and 20% for real b and charm jets, respectively, while falsely tagging 3% of light jets.",

Systematic uncertainties also arise from ambiguities in reconstructing the top quarks from their jet and lepton remnants. We minimize such uncertainties by using independent data to calibrate the absolute response of the detector, and we use state-of-the-art input from theory for modeling the signal and backgrounds. We use alternative models for signal and different parameters for modeling backgrounds to check our assumptions. Table VIII lists the uncertainties from the Run II lepton+jets measurements for CDF and D0 that are based on the matrix element technique [26,27]. These two measurements provide most of the sensitivity to the combined m t result and are discussed below. Before explaining how each individual systematic uncertainty is estimated, we will first discuss how the uncertainties from different sources are propagated to m t and how they are calculated using ensembles of pseudoexperiments.",

Bottom quark jets can also contain an electron that showers in a pattern different than for hadronic particles, or the jet may contain a muon that does neither produce a shower nor gets absorbed in the calorimeter.

D0 applies the b-tagging algorithm directly to MC events for recent Run II measurements. Previously b-tagging was simulated with tag-probability, and in Run I, as D0 did not have a silicon tracker, nonisolated muons were used to identify b-jets. The tagging efficiency for simulated events is made to match that in data by randomly dropping b tags for b and c jets, while assigning a per-jet weight for tagging light-flavor jets as b jets.
