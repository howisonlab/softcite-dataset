            "text": "Despite its undeniable success, the standard model (SM) fails to answer some of the most fundamental questions in particle physics. Among these are the source of matter-antimatter asymmetry, the particle nature of dark matter, the origin of dark energy, and the acquisition of neutrino mass. The aim of this paper is to present a search for physics beyond the standard model in final states containing two hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons (\u03c4 h ) and two high transverse momentum (p T ) jets. The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . To illustrate the sensitivity of this search for processes not included in the SM, two benchmark physics scenarios are considered for the interpretation of the results: the production of heavy, righthanded Majorana neutrinos and the production of third-generation leptoquarks (LQs). A description of the two models is given below. The observation of neutrino oscillations implies nonzero neutrino masses, prompting a corresponding extension of the SM. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments together with cosmological constraints imply very small values for these masses [1][2][3][4]. The most popular explanation for very small neutrino masses is the \"seesaw\" mechanism [5][6][7] in which the observed left-handed chiral states are paired with very heavy right-handed partners. This mechanism can be realized in the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) [2][3][4], JHEP03(2019)170 Figure 1.

The SU(2) R group, similarly to SU(2) L , predicts the existence of three new gauge bosons, W \u00b1 R and Z , and three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino states N ( = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ), partners of the light neutrinos \u03bd . A reference process allowed by this model is the production of a right-handed W R boson that decays to a heavy neutrino and a lepton of the same generation (W R \u2192 +N \u2192 +( qq )) and gives rise to two jets and two leptons of the same flavor in the final state. Of particular interest for this analysis is the scenario in which the W R decay chain results in a pair of high-p T \u03c4 leptons, W R \u2192 \u03c4 + N \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + (\u03c4 qq ).

These theories predict a new scalar or vector boson, referred to as a leptoquark in the literature, which carries nonzero lepton and baryon numbers, as well as color and fractional electric charge [9,17]. In order to comply with experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents and other rare processes [28,29], three types of LQs are generally considered, each coupled to the leptons and quarks of its generation. The LQs recently gained notable theoretical attention as one of the most suitable candidates to explain the B \u2192 D * \u03c4 \u03bd and b \u2192 s anomalies reported by the BaBar [30,31], Belle [32][33][34][35], and LHCb [36][37][38][39][40] Collaborations. In particular, models containing enhanced couplings to the third-generation SM particles are favored to interpret these results [41][42][43][44]. In this search, we consider pair-produced scalar LQs, each decaying to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark (b). Figure 2 shows the LO Feynman diagrams for the pair-production of LQs.",

The most stringent limits in the \u03c4 \u03c4 jj final states are set in ref. [50] and exclude W R masses below 2.9 TeV, assuming that the mass of the right-handed neutrino is half of the mass of the W R boson, and scalar -2 - LQ masses below 850 GeV, assuming that the LQ decays to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark with 100% branching fraction. Moreover, searches for third-generation LQs have been performed in other final states: pairs of scalar LQs each of which decays to a \u03c4 lepton and a top quark [53], pairs of scalar and vector LQs each of which decays to a quark (top, bottom, or light-flavor) and a neutrino [54], and singly produced scalar LQs in association with a \u03c4 lepton with the LQ decaying to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark [55]. In this analysis we focus on the \u03c4 \u03c4 jj search channel in which both of the \u03c4 leptons decay hadronically. Hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays account for approximately 65% of all possible \u03c4 lepton final states, so that the pair branching fraction is 42%.",

The event reconstruction is described in section 3, followed by the description of the simulation of the signal and background samples in section 4. The selection criteria defining the signal region (SR), described in section 5, reduce the background contributions to achieve maximum discovery potential. A main challenge of this analysis is to achieve high and well-understood signal selection and trigger efficiencies, with small systematic uncertainty, with SM signatures containing genuine \u03c4 h candidates. The strategy is described in section 6 and relies on the selection of Z(\u2192 )+jets events. A number of additional background-enriched regions are described in section 6. These regions are defined to minimize the systematic uncertainty of the background contributions as well as to cross-check the accuracy of the efficiency measurements. Relevant systematic uncertainties are described in section 7. The results are presented in section 8. The paper concludes with a summary in section 9.",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m inner diameter, providing a field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are the silicon pixel and strip tracker, the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), which includes a silicon sensor preshower detector in front of the ECAL endcaps, and the brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry. The inner tracker measures charged particles within pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and provides an impact parameter resolution of \u223c15 \u00b5m and a transverse momentum resolution of about 1.5% for 100 GeV particles. Collision events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, selects events at a rate of around 100 kHz. The second level, based on an array of microprocessors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

In the PF approach, information from all detectors is combined to reconstruct and identify final-state particles (muons, electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons) produced in the pp collision. PF particles are clustered into jets using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [58] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jets are required to pass identification criteria designed to reject anomalous behavior from the calorimeters. The identification efficiency is >99% for jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 that are within the tracking acceptance [59]. The jet energy scale and resolution in simulation are corrected to match their measured values in data using factors that depend on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet [60,61]. Jets originating from the hadronization of bottom quarks are identified using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [62] which exploits observables related to the long lifetime of b hadrons. For b quark jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, the algorithm's identification efficiency at the loose working point used in this analysis is about 80%, while misidentification rate for light-quark and gluon jets is about 10% [62]. Although a b-tagged jet requirement is not used to define the LQ SR, b quark jets are used to obtain tt-enriched control samples for estimation of the background rate in the SR.",

This algorithm starts from anti-k T jets and reconstructs \u03c4 h candidates from tracks (also referred to as \"prongs\") and energy deposits in strips of the ECAL, in the 1-prong, 1-prong + \u03c0 0 , 2-prong, and 3-prong decay modes. The 2-prong decay mode allows \u03c4 h candidates to be reconstructed even if one track has not been reconstructed. However, given the large rate for jets to be misidentified in this decay mode, the 2-prong decay mode is not used to reconstruct \u03c4 h candidates in the signal region of this analysis. To suppress backgrounds from light-quark or gluon jets, identification and isolation conditions are enforced by requiring the \u03c4 h candidates to pass a threshold value of a multivariate (MVA) discriminator [67] that takes isolation variables and variables related to the \u03c4 lepton lifetime as input. The isolation variables are calculated using a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.5 in the vicinity of the identified \u03c4 h candidate and considering the energy deposits of particles not included in the reconstruction of the \u03c4 h decay mode. The \"tight\" MVA isolation working point [67] is used to define the SR, which results in a \u03c4 h identification efficiency of typically 55% for the kinematic range used in this analysis. Additionally, \u03c4 h candidates are required to be distinguishable from electrons and muons. The algorithm to discriminate a \u03c4 h from an electron utilizes observables that quantify the compactness and shape of energy deposits in the ECAL, to distinguish electromagnetic from hadronic showers, in combination with observables that are sensitive to the amount of bremsstrahlung emitted along the leading track and to the overall particle multiplicity. The discriminator against muons is based on the presence of measurements in the muon system associated with the track of the \u03c4 h candidate.",

Since the dijet and p miss T selection criteria are the same as in the SR, the datato-simulation scale factor SF tt \u00b5\u00b5 = 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 measured in this CR represents a correction for the modeling of the dijet and p miss T selection efficiencies by simulation. Figure 3 (right) shows the S MET T distribution in this CR, after correcting the tt normalization from simulation using the measured scale factor SF tt \u00b5\u00b5 . The agreement gives confidence that the S MET T shape for the tt background can be taken from simulation. An alternate estimate of the scale factor is obtained from a CR defined with the same dijet and p miss T requirements as for the SR but selecting events with one muon and one electron (instead of a \u03c4 h \u03c4 h pair). The resulting estimate, SF tt e\u00b5 = 0.90 \u00b1 0.01, is combined with the measurement from the dimuon CR; the average of the two scale factors (SF tt ) is used to estimate the tt prediction in the SR, and the absolute difference between the two scale factors, 3%, is considered a systematic uncertainty in the estimated tt yield. Therefore, the tt contribution in the SR, N tt SR , is given by N tt SR = N tt SR (MC)SF tt . The measurement of the Z+jets background component is based on both simulation and data. Ideally the Z+jets contribution to the SR would be obtained using a CR obtained with similar \u03c4 h \u03c4 h jj criteria to the SR, but with minimal modifications to the selection to achieve negligible signal contamination. However, such a CR has too few events, resulting in large systematic uncertainty. Instead, since the efficiency of the requirement of two high quality \u03c4 h candidates is known to be well modeled by simulation [67], we use a Z+jetsenriched control sample obtained by requiring two well-identified muons with an invariant mass compatible with the Z-mass peak, instead of two \u03c4 h candidates, and all of the other",

Therefore, these effects are included as systematic uncertainties. The following systematic uncertainties are considered. A p T -dependent uncertainty per \u03c4 h candidate in the measured trigger efficiency results in a 6% uncertainty in the signal and background predictions that rely on simulation. The trigger efficiency is measured per \u03c4 h candidate by calculating the fraction of Z(\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h ) events (selected with a single-\u00b5 trigger), that also pass a \u00b5-\u03c4 h trigger that has the same \u03c4 h trigger requirements as the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h trigger used to define the SR. Systematic effects related to the correct \u03c4 h identification are measured to be 5% per \u03c4 h candidate [75]. This effect is estimated from a fit to the Z(\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) visible mass distribution, using the production cross section measured in the Z(\u2192 ee) and Z(\u2192 \u00b5\u00b5) final states. An additional asymmetric systematic uncertainty of +5% and \u221235% at p T = 1 TeV [67] that increases linearly with p T is included to account for the extrapolation in the \u03c4 h identification efficiency estimate, which is mostly determined by low-p T hadronic \u03c4 lepton decays close to the Z boson peak, to the higher-p T regimes relevant to this analysis. A 3% uncertainty in the reconstructed \u03c4 h energy scale (TES) is used to assign a systematic uncertainty in both the predicted yields and the mass and S MET T shapes for signal and background with total or partial MC estimation [67]. This effect ranges from 3 to 9% depending on the sample. Systematic effects on normalization and shapes due to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES) (2-5% depending on p T and \u03b7) are also included, resulting in 5 to 9% uncertainty in the normalization, depending on the sample. Systematic uncertainties in the shapes, based on the level of agreement between the data and MC distributions in the control samples, are also assigned. The data-to-simulation ratios of the mass and S MET T distributions are fit with a first-order polynomial. The deviation of the fit from unity, as a function of mass or S MET T , is assigned as a systematic uncertainty in the shape. This results in up to 20% systematic uncertainty in a given bin. We have checked that the choice of a first-order polynomial for the fit function adequately describes potential differences between data and MC simulation. A 2.5% uncertainty comes from the measurement of the total integrated luminosity [76], and affects signal and all backgrounds that are determined (in part or entirely) by simulation.",

            "text": "The observed yield is 117 events, while the total predicted background yield is 127.0 \u00b1 11.8 events (see table 2). Table 2 illustrates the relative importance of the different backgrounds. Note, however, that the relative yields of different background processes do not directly reflect the effect on the sensitivity of the analysis, as a binned maximum likelihood fit, in which shape information enters besides the yields, is used to set limits on the signal rate. observed data event rate and shapes are consistent with the SM background expectation. Therefore, exclusion limits for the two signal benchmark scenarios are set, using the distribution in m(\u03c4 h,1 , \u03c4 h,2 , j 1 , j 2 , p miss T ) for the N \u03c4 case and in S MET T for the LQ interpretation. The results are presented as 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the signal production cross sections, estimated with the modified frequentist construction CL s method [80][81][82]. Maximum likelihood fits are performed using the final m(\u03c4 h,1 , \u03c4 h,2 , j 1 , j 2 , p miss T ) and S MET T discrimination variables to derive the expected and observed limits. Systematic uncertainties are represented by nuisance parameters, assuming a gamma function prior for the uncertainties in the data-driven background estimations, log-normal prior for MC-driven normalization parameters, and Gaussian priors for the shape uncertainties. Statistical uncertainties in the shape templates are accounted for by the technique described in ref. [83]. Figure 6 shows the expected and observed limits on the cross section, as well as the theoretical prediction [72,73], as functions of m(W R ) and m(LQ). For heavy neutrino models with strict left-right symmetry, with the assumptions that only the N \u03c4 flavor contributes significantly to the W R decay width and that the N \u03c4 mass is 0.5 \u00d7 m(W R ), W R masses below 3.50 TeV are excluded at 95% CL (expected exclusion 3.35 TeV). For the LQ interpretation using S MET T as the final fit variable, the observed (expected) 95% CL exclusion is 1.02 (1.00) TeV. These results are the most stringent limits to date. ",
