Several novel techniques have been developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties with respect to previous publications, whereas the efficiency of the\u03bd e signal has increased. The value of \u03b8 13 is measured to be sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.090 +0.032   \u22120.029 from a fit to the observed energy spectrum. Deviations from the reactor\u03bd e prediction observed above a prompt signal energy of 4 MeV and possible explanations are also reported. A consistent value of \u03b8 13 is obtained from a fit to the observed rate as a function of the reactor power independently of the spectrum shape and background estimation, demonstrating the robustness of the \u03b8 13 measurement despite the observed distortion.",

Among the three mixing angles, \u03b8 13 has been measured recently by\u03bd e disappearance in short-baseline experiments [1][2][3][4][5] and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance in longbaseline experiments [6,7]. The other two angles had been measured before, 1 while the mass hierarchy of neutrinos and CP-violation phase are still unknown. The discovery potential of future projects critically depends on the values of the mixing angles and, therefore, a precise measurement of \u03b8 13 is essential for deep understandings of neutrino physics expected in the following decades.",

The analysis is based on a new method of energy reconstruction described in section 3. After the delayed coincidence is required, remaining backgrounds are mostly induced by cosmic muons, including long-lived cosmogenic isotopes, proton recoils by muon-induced spallation neutrons and stopping muons. Several novel techniques have been developed in the new analysis to suppress such backgrounds (section 4). In contrast, IBD signal efficiency has increased with the extended signal window and, together with the newly developed analysis methods, detection systematic uncertainties have been reduced by almost a factor of two with respect to the previous analysis (section 5). Remaining backgrounds are estimated by dedicated studies described in section 6 and also directly measured in reactor-off running as shown in section 7. The value of \u03b8 13 is extracted from a fit to the prompt energy spectrum. Additional deviations from the reactor \u03bd e prediction are observed above 4 MeV although the impact on the \u03b8 13 measurement is not significant. A consistent value of \u03b8 13 is also obtained by a fit to the observed rates as a function of reactor power, which provides a complementary measurement independent of the energy spectrum shape and background estimation. Results of the neutrino oscillation analyses and investigation of observed spectral distortion are discussed in section 8 and 9.",

Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the Double Chooz detector. The innermost volume, named \u03bd-target (NT), is filled with 10 m 3 Gd-loaded liquid scintillator [9]. NT is surrounded by a 55 cm thick Gd-free liquid scintillator layer, called the \u03b3-catcher (GC). When neutrons from IBD interactions are captured on Gd in the NT, \u03b3-rays with a total energy of 8 MeV are emitted. These \u03b3-rays are detected either by the NT and/or the GC. The GC is further surrounded by a 105 cm thick non-scintillating mineral oil layer, called the Buffer. The boundaries of the NT, GC and Buffer are made of transparent acrylic vessels, while the Buffer volume is surrounded by a steel tank and optically separated from an outer layer described below. There are low background 10-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) [10,11] positioned on the inner surface of the buffer tank. Orientation and positions of the PMT assemblies and dimensions of the tank walls were verified by photographic survey. The Buffer layer works as a shield to \u03b3-rays from radioactivity of PMTs and the surrounding rock. The inner three regions and PMTs are collectively referred to as the inner detector (ID). Outside of the ID is a 50 cm thick liquid scintillator layer called the inner veto (IV). The IV is equipped with 78 8inch PMTs, among which 24 PMTs are arranged on the top, 12 PMTs at mid-height on the side walls and 42 PMTs on the bottom. The IV works not only as an active veto to cosmic ray muons but as a shield to fast neutrons from outside of the detector. Fast neutrons are often tagged by the IV as well. The whole detector is further surrounded by a 15 cm thick steel shield to protect it against external \u03b3-rays. Each ID and IV PMT is surrounded by mumetal to suppress magnetic field from the Earth and the steel shield [12]. A central chimney, connected to all layers, allows the introduction of the liquids and calibration sources.",

In addition, multi-wavelength LED-fiber systems are used to inject light into the ID and IV from a set of fixed points mounted on the PMT covers.

In addition to these calibration devices, abundant spallation neutrons captured on H, Gd and C and Bi-Po decays from radio-impurity in the liquid scintillator are used for various calibration purposes.

The instantaneous thermal power of each reactor core is provided by EDF with time steps of < 1 minute with an uncertainty of 0.5 % at the full reactor power.\u03bd e 's are produced in nuclear reactors by the \u03b2-decay of fission products, in which more than 99.7 % of fissions originate from four isotopes, 235 U, 239 Pu, 238 U, and 241 Pu. The reference\u03bd e spectra are derived for 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu from fits to their \u03b2 spectrum measured at the ILL research reactor [14][15][16] considering the allowed transitions. It was highlighted that contribution of the forbidden transitions have some impact on the neutrino spectrum [17], but this is under investigation. In addition, a measurement of the spectrum from 238 U [18] is newly used in this analysis with an extrapolation below 3 MeV and above 7.5 MeV, using a combination of the summation method [19] and an exponential-polynomial fit on the data. In the previous analysis, the 238 U contribution was derived from a calculation [20]. Estimation of\u03bd e flux based on the new measurement is larger by 10 % at 3 MeV with respect to the previous calculation for the 238 U contribution, which is itself roughly 10 % of the total\u03bd e flux. Evolution of each fractional fission rate and associated errors are evaluated using a full core model and assembly simulations developed with the MURE code [21,22]. Benchmarks with other codes have been performed [23] in order to validate the simulations. Locations and initial burn-up of each assembly are provided by EDF for every reactor fuel cycle with approximately one year in duration and used as input to the core simulation. In order to suppress the normalization uncertainty in the\u03bd e prediction, Double Chooz used the\u03bd e rate measurement by Bugey4 [24] at a distance of 15 m with corrections for the different fuel composition between Bugey4 and each of the Chooz cores. Systematic uncertainty on the IBD signal rate associated with the flux prediction is evaluated to be 1.7 % of which the dominant component is an uncertainty of 1.4 % in the Bugey4 measurement as shown in table 1, while the uncertainty would have been 2.8 % without use of the Bugey4 rate measurement. Contributions from forbidden \u03b2 decays are effectively integrated in the Bugey4 rate measurement, whereas it neglects possible influence to the spectrum shape.",

Due to limited sampling of the waveform digitizer, the baseline estimation can be biased within \u00b11 ADC count, which results in a gain non-linearity especially below a few photoelectrons [28]. Gain is measured using the data taken with a constant light yield provided by the LED-fiber calibration systems, as g i = \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03c3 2 i /\u00b5 i , where \u00b5 i and \u03c3 i are the mean and standard deviation (RMS) of the observed charge distribution. The parameter \u03b1 is used to correct for the intrinsic spread in \u03c3 i due to single p.e. width and electronic noise. It is considered to be constant for all readout channels and is chosen by making the number of photoelectrons in the H capture of spallation neutrons equal to the hit PMT multiplicity (n).

Calibration data are taken with different light intensities and light injection positions to measure the gain non-linearity of all channels. Figure 2 shows the measured gain as a function of integrated charge for a typical readout channel, overlaid with the gain correction function characterized by three parameters: constant gain at high charge, non-linearity slope at low charge and the transition point. Since the gain and its non-linearity change after power cycles of the readout electronics, the gain is measured upon each power-cycle period.

Time variation of the mean gain is measured to be 1.2 % from the standard deviation of the H capture peak of muon-induced spallation neutrons collected during the physics data taking. Because the magnitude of the variation is energy dependent due to the residual gain non-linearity and inefficiency of single p.e. detection, the time variation correction is applied with a linear dependence on energy. The energy dependence is determined using \u03b1 decays of 212 Po and neutrons captured on H and Gd by minimizing the time variation of the peak energies for the three samples. After the gain calibration is applied, the remaining time variation is considered to be due to the detector response, such as scintillator light yield and readout response. The time variation of the detector response is measured using the peak energy of neutrons captured on H distributed over the NT and GC to be +0.30 %/year, increasing with time, which is calibrated out as part of stability correction. The exact source of the increase is under investigation. Figure 5 shows the stability of the peak energy of 212 Po \u03b1 decays and neutron captures on H and Gd after the stability correction is applied.

Figure 6 shows the remaining discrepancy of the energy scales between the data and MC after the QNL correction is applied. The plot is shown as a function of the average single \u03b3 energy for various \u03b3 and 252 Cf neutron sources deployed at the center of the NT.

This indicates that the cause of the discrepancy is not in the charge reconstruction but in the scintillator modeling. In order to evaluate the LNL, MC simulations are generated with several different combinations of Birks' quenching parameter kB and the light yield of the liquid scintillator within the uncertainties from the lab measurements [29,30]. Varying the light yield of the scintillator changes the ratio of scintillation light to Cherenkov light and results in different non-linearity. Among the several combinations, possible sets of the two parameters, those which show reasonable agreement with data, are retained and a positron MC simulation is generated with each of these sets of parameters.

The Q dev calculation is a measure of the non-uniformity of the observed charge of the neighboring PMTs around the one with maximum charge, which tends to be large for light noise events. The Q dev cut is effective in reducing light noise at high energy around or above the Gd capture peak. Figure 8 shows the reduction of light noise background by the above cuts. The Gd capture peak and the spectra of radioactive contaminants, such as the 2.6 MeV \u03b3 from 208 Tl, are visible after light noise events are rejected.

The lower cut on \u2206T was set at 2 \u00b5s in the previous analysis due to contamination of stopping muons below the cut, thus introducing a systematic uncertainty.

Figure 9 shows the \u2206R distributions for the data and MC simulation, together with the data collected in off-time coincidence windows (see section 6.3).

Incoming neutrons from IBD reactions outside the NT lead to neutron captures on Gd (spill-in) while neutrons created inside the NT may escape to the GC and be captured on H (spill-out). These spill-in and spill-out currents do not cancel each other: there are more spill-in events than spill-out events due to the longer neutron travel distance in the GC in absence of Gd and geometrical considerations. The source of the systematic uncertainty on the spill-in and spill-out current is dominated by the modeling of low energy neutrons scattering on light nuclei, and is particularly sensitive to the molecular bonds. In Double Chooz, a custom neutron simulation code was developed for the neutron thermalization process (see section 2.2). The net spill current is defined as the difference between the number of spill-in and spill-out events. As the spill currents cannot be measured from the data directly, the ratio of the net spill current to the number of IBD interactions in the NT is calculated from our nominal Geant4-based IBD simulation MC to be 2.08 %. The uncertainty of this ratio is estimated from the difference between the nominal 2.08 % and the alternative value, 2.36 %, estimated using a different MC simulation code, Tripoli4 [33], designed for the accurate modeling of low energy neutron physics.",

Some of the cosmogenic isotopes, such as 9 Li and 8 He, emit a neutron in association with their \u03b2 decay, and cannot be distinguished from the IBD signals by the event topology. The lifetime of 9 Li and 8 He are 257 ms and 172 ms, respectively, much longer than the 1 ms muon veto. Contamination from the cosmogenic isotopes (collectively referred to as Li hereafter as the main contribution is 9 Li) is evaluated from fits to the time correlation between the IBD candidates and the previous muons (\u2206T \u00b5 ). The Li rate is evaluated without the Li+He veto (see section 4.3) first, and then the fraction of vetoed events is subtracted later. Muons are divided into sub-samples by the energy in the ID, as the probability to generate cosmogenic isotopes increases with the energy deposits in the detector. Only the sample above 600 MeV * (MeV * represents MeV-equivalent scale as the energy reconstruction is not ensured at such high energy due to non-linearity associated with flash-ADC saturation effects) is sufficiently pure to produce a precise fit result. At lower energies below 600 MeV * , an additional cut on the distance of muon tracks to the vertex of the prompt signal (d) is introduced to reduce accidental muon-IBD pairs: only muons which satisfy d < 75 cm are considered. The inefficiency of muon-Li pairs due to the distance cut is evaluated for each energy range as the product of the acceptance and the lateral profile of the Li vertex position with respect to the muon track. The lateral profile is extracted from the high energy muon sample above 600 MeV * as shown in figure 13. After the correction for inefficiency, the total cosmogenic background rate is determined to be 2.20 +0.35 \u22120.27 events/day. In order to further constrain the background rate, a lower limit is computed separately. A Li-enriched muon sample is selected with the following cuts: 1) E \u00b5 > 300 MeV * if there is more than or equal to one neutron candidates following the muon within 1 ms; 2) E \u00b5 > 500 MeV *  He is also evaluated assuming a fraction of 8 \u00b1 7 % based on the measurement by KamLAND [34], rescaled to account for the different energies of the cosmic muons illuminating the two experiments, and taken into account in the rate estimate and its uncertainty. In the standard IBD selection, Li candidates are rejected by the Li+He veto. The number of Li events rejected by the Li+He veto is determined by a fit to the \u2206T \u00b5 distribution to be 1.12\u00b10.05 events/day. A consistent value is confirmed by a counting approach, in which the number of Li candidates in the off-time windows is subtracted from the number of Li candidates rejected in the IBD selection. After subtracting Li events rejected by the Li+He veto, the final cosmogenic isotope background rate is estimated to be 0.97 +0.41 \u22120.16 events/day. The spectrum shape of cosmogenic isotope background is measured by the Li candidate events which include both 9 Li and 8 He events. Li candidates with neutrons captured on H are also included to reduce statistical uncertainty. Backgrounds in the Li candidates (which are due to accidental pairs of muons and IBD signals) are measured by off-time windows and subtracted. The measured prompt energy spectrum is shown in figure 15, together with the prediction from the 9 Li MC simulation, as reference, which has been newly developed by considering possible branches of the \u03b2-decay chains including \u03b1 and neutron emissions. can be background if the recoil protons are detected in the prompt energy window and, later, a thermalized neutron (either the same neutron or a different one) is captured on Gd.",

The accidental background rate and spectrum shape are measured by the off-time window method, in which the time windows are placed more than 1 sec after the prompt candidate, keeping all other criteria unchanged, in order to collect random coincidences only. A multiple number of successive windows are opened to accumulate statistics. The background rate in the off-time windows is measured to be 0.0701 \u00b1 0.0003(stat) \u00b1 0.0026(syst) events/day, in which corrections for the different dead time from the standard IBD selection and the associated systematic uncertainties on the correction are accounted for. The error on the accidental background rate estimate is larger than that in the previous analysis due to a correction factor introduced to account for the different efficiency of the Li+He veto for accidental coincidences in on-time and off-time windows. The accidental background rate is found to be stable over the data taking period. The prompt energy spectrum of the measured accidental background is shown in figure 17. Estimated background rates are summarized in table 4 including contributions from other background sources not used in the neutrino oscillation fit. The background rate of 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O reactions is evaluated from the contamination of \u03b1 emitters (including 152 Gd) in the detector to be well below 0.1 events/day. 12 B events are produced from 12 C in the detector either through an (n, p) reaction with spallation neutrons or a (\u00b5 \u2212 , \u03bd \u00b5 ) reaction with cosmic muons, and then \u03b2 \u2212 decay with a lifetime of 29.1 ms and a Q-value of 13.4 MeV.

Given the indication from the eRRM fit, the correlation between the rate of the excess and reactor power is further investigated by a dedicated study targeted on the region of the excess. First, assuming the IBD rate is smoothly decreasing with the energy, its rate between 4.25 and 6 MeV, where it is most enhanced, is estimated by an interpolation with a second order polynomial from the observed rate below 4.25 MeV and above 6 MeV as shown in figure 25. Second, the rate of excess is defined as the observed IBD candidate rate between 4.25 and 6 MeV after subtracting the interpolation estimation, and the correlation between the rate of excess and the number of operating reactors is investigated. If the excess is due to an unknown background, the rate of the excess should be independent of the reactor power, while as shown in the inset plot (left) in figure 25, a strong correlation between the rate of excess and the number of operating reactors is confirmed. The significance of the correlation becomes stronger by adding the IBD candidates with neutrons captured on H based on the same data set used in this paper and following the selection criteria described in ref. [2] (right-hand plot in the inset).  figure: points show the correlations between the observed rate of the excess (defined in the text) and the number of operating reactors, and the histograms show the total IBD candidate rate (area normalized). The H capture sample includes accidental background with a rate comparable to the IBD signals and therefore the total rate of the Gd+H sample has an offset due to this background in addition to IBD signals which is proportional to the reactor power.",

Figure 21 shows the energy spectrum of the prompt signal superimposed on the best-fit prediction and the background components. \u22120.048 events/day. The error for each parameter is defined as the range of \u03c7 2 < \u03c7 2 min + 1.0. A consistent value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is thus obtained without the constraint to the background rates and the size of the errors are comparable after the fit. This indicates that the uncertainties on the background rates are strongly suppressed in the R+S fit by the spectral shape information, and the output value of \u03b8 13 is robust with respect to the background estimation.",

Observed rates in the reactor-on and reactor-off periods are separately used in the fit. Figure 22 shows the ratio of the data to the null oscillation prediction after subtraction of the background as a function of the visible energy of the prompt signal. An energy dependent deficit is clearly seen in the data below 4 MeV, which is consistent with the expectation from reactor neutrino oscillation. On the other hand, besides the oscillatory signature, a spectrum distortion is observed at high energy above 4 MeV, which can be characterized by an excess around 5 MeV and a deficit around 7 MeV. In order to examine the impact of the excess on the measurement of \u03b8 13 , a test of the R+S fit is carried out with an artificial excess in the prediction peaked at around 5 MeV. The normalization of the excess is left free in the test fit. Among the outputs of the test fits with different peak energies and the widths of the excess, the maximum variations of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and the output 9 Li+ 8 He rate are within, respectively, 30 % and 10 % of their uncertainties.
