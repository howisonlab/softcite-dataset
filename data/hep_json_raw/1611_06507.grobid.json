            "text": "The associated production of vector bosons and jets (V+jets) in hadronic collisions is a large background source in measurements of several standard model (SM) processes, Higgs boson studies, and many searches for physics beyond the SM. Its description constitutes an important benchmark for perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions. Differential cross sections as a function of kinematic observables characterizing V+jets topologies are sensitive to the contributions from both the hard scattering process and the associated soft QCD radiation, as well as to the parton distribution functions (PDFs). Among the V+jets processes, the case in which a Z/\u03b3 * boson is produced in association with b quarks, pp \u2192 Z + (\u22651b), hereafter denoted as Z(1b), is particularly interesting. Antiquarks are also assumed in the notation, and the Z/\u03b3 * interference contribution is considered to be part of the process. Within the SM, the Z(1b) final state is the dominant background for studies of the associated e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch production of Higgs and Z bosons, in which the Higgs boson decays into a bb pair [1]. Many physics scenarios beyond the SM predict final states with b quarks and Z bosons: new generations of heavy quarks (b , t ) decaying into Z(1b) [2], supersymmetric Higgs bosons produced in association with b quarks [3], and extended SM scenarios with additional SU (2) doublets with enhanced Zbb coupling [4]. The study of the associated production of Z bosons and b quark jets may also provide information useful in describing an analogous process where a W boson is produced, which is more difficult to measure because of higher background contamination.",

The Z boson is reconstructed through its leptonic decay into an electron or muon pair, while the presence of b quarks is inferred from the characteristics of jets (denoted as b jets) that originate from their hadronization products and subsequent decays. In order to characterize Z(1b) production, fiducial differential cross sections are measured as a function of five kinematic observables: the transverse momentum p T and pseudorapidity \u03b7 of the highestp T b jet, the Z boson p T , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets regardless of the flavour of the parton producing them (H T ), and the azimuthal angular difference between the direction of the Z boson and the highestp T b jet (\u0394\u03c6 Zb ). Ratios of the differential cross sections for Z(1b) and Z+jets production, inclusive in jet flavour, are also measured as a function of these five observables. The cancellation of several systematic uncertainties in the cross section ratio allows an even more precise comparison with theory than the differential cross sections themselves.",

            "text": "A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with the definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [11]. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter. The field volume houses a silicon tracker, a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The magnet flux-return yoke is instrumented with muon detectors. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and is located in the 3.8 T field of the superconducting solenoid. For nonisolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90  \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [12]. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [13]. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [14]. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors.",

Diboson events with a leptonic Z boson decay and jets produced in the hadronic decay of the other vector boson are not considered as part of the signal. Samples of simulated events are used to model both the signal and the background processes. The MadGraph 5.1.3.30 [15] event generator is used to simulate Z+jets (including jets from b quarks), W+jets, and tt events; this generator implements a leading-order (LO) matrix element calculation with up to four (three) additional partons in the final state for V+jets (tt) events, using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [16], which is based on the five flavour scheme (5FS). A detailed discussion is given in Sect. 8.2. The parton-level events are interfaced with pythia version 6.424 [17] for parton showering, hadronization, and description of the multiple-parton interactions (MPIs). The pythia6 Z2* tune, which is based on the CTEQ6L1 PDF set, is used [18]. The matrix element and parton shower calculations are matched using the k t -MLM algorithm [19]. The cross section inclusive in jet multiplicity is rescaled to its next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) prediction, computed with fewz 3.1 [20,21] for the Z+jets and W+jets processes, and with the calculation of Ref. [22] for the tt process. To study systematic uncertainties, signal events are also generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [23] version 2.2.1, with next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix elements for zero, one, and two additional partons merged with the FxFx algorithm [24], interfaced with pythia version 8.205 [25] for showering and hadronization. In this case the NNPDF 3.0 NLO PDF set [26] is used. Depending on the flavours included in the matrix element calculation of the event or produced in the parton shower through gluon splitting, the inclusive Z+jets sample can be divided into Z+b quark, c quark, and light-flavour (u, d, s quark and gluon) jet subsamples. As explained in Sect. 6, the jet flavour identification is based on the particle content of the final state.",

Reconstructed electrons must satisfy a set of selection criteria designed to minimize misidentification at a desired efficiency level [13]; the discriminating observables include the measured shower shape in the ECAL and the spatial matching between the electromagnetic deposit in the calorimeter and the reconstructed track associated with it. Additional requirements on electron tracks are used to reject products of photon conversions. Electron isolation criteria exploit the full PF-based event reconstruction, using particles within a cone around the electron direction with radius \u0394R = \u221a (\u0394\u03c6) 2 + (\u0394\u03b7) 2 = 0.3.

The notation p e T refers to the transverse momentum of the reconstructed electron. Pileup can add extra particles, which affect the isolation variable. Accordingly, only charged particles originating from the reconstructed primary vertex are used in the calculation of I charged . The photon and neutral hadronic contribution to the isolation variable coming from pileup is subtracted using the jet area approach [36].

The threshold applied to the discriminating variable gives a b tagging efficiency of about 50% and a misidentification probability of 0.1% for light jets and 1% for c jets. Scale factors, measured in multijet events and dependent on jet p T , are used to correct the b, c, and light-flavour jet efficiencies in the simulation to match those observed in the data [42]. The scale factors for b jets are determined using samples of events enriched in such a flavour of jets. This enrichment is obtained including both multijet events containing a muon geometrically associated with a jet, with high probability of originating from the semileptonic decay of a b hadron, and leptonic and semileptonic tt events, where the leading p T jets are usually b jets. The scale factors are around 0.93, slowly decreasing for jets with p T above 120 GeV. The scale factors for c jets are assumed the same as for b jets, with an uncertainty twice as large. Relatively pure samples of c jets from W + c events, selected using identified muons within the jet, are used to validate this assumption. For light-flavour jets, the same CSV algorithm yields scale factors between 1.1 and 1.4, depending on the jet p T . The calculation is based on tracks with negative signed impact parameter and secondary vertices with negative signed decay lengths, where the sign is defined by the relative direction of the jet and the particle momentum. Finally, events are selected if they contain a Z boson candidate and at least one b-tagged jet.",

The tt background contribution is estimated separately for Z+jets, Z(1b), and Z(2b) events by using the signal selection criteria to produce samples of e\u03bc pairs, which are enriched in tt events with negligible signal contamination. For each measured observable these samples provide the estimates of the tt background; residual non-tt backgrounds in them, amounting to about 29, 8 and 2% respectively, are subtracted using the simulated prediction. The integrals of such esti- mates need to be rescaled by the ratio of the same-flavour lepton to e\u03bc yields. This ratio is determined using control samples for both the same-flavour lepton and e\u03bc selections by inverting the E miss T significance requirement, namely, E miss T significance >30. For the same-flavour lepton samples, this selection removes the contribution from the signal processes, while enhancing the fraction of tt events in the sample. The residual contamination from other non-tt processes is simi-lar in the same-lepton and e\u03bc selections, amounting to about 20, 7, 3% respectively, and is again taken into account using the simulation. The ratio of the e\u03bc to the ee or \u03bc\u03bc yields in the control samples is used to rescale the estimates of this background source for each lepton channel separately. The ratio is determined as the scaling factor for the normalization of the binned dilepton invariant mass (M ) distribution in the e\u03bc sample that minimizes the difference of this distribution from the corresponding same-lepton-flavour M distribution in a least-square fit procedure. The fit of the M distribution is performed in the sideband regions 50-84 GeV and 100-200 GeV, to avoid any assumption about the M shape for both different and same-flavour lepton pairs in the Z peak region. The remaining background sources are estimated using simulation. Diboson events may mimic the Z+b final state when one or more leptons are not reconstructed or when a W or Z boson decays hadronically into a qq pair (in particular a Z boson may decay into a genuine bb pair). Single top quarks produced in association with either a W boson or one or more b jets may also generate a signal-like signature. These events, together with W+jets, can mimic the signal if a lepton of the same flavour is produced in the hadronization or if a hadron is misidentified. The contribution of multijet events is found to be negligible, as has been previously observed in other similar Z+jets analyses [45].",

This fraction is determined from a study of the secondary vertex mass distribution of the leading b-tagged jet, defined as the invariant mass of all the charged particles associated with its secondary vertices, assuming the pion mass for each considered particle. This evaluation is done separately for dielectron and dimuon final states to avoid correlations between channels and to simplify the combination. The secondary vertex mass distributions for b, c, and light-flavour jets produced in association with Z bosons are obtained from the simulation based on the MadGraph event generator interfaced with pythia6 by using the 5FS scheme for PDFs. The sum of the distributions is fitted to the observed distribution with an extended binned likelihood, after subtraction of all non-Drell-Yan background contributions, by varying the three normalization scale factors c b , c c , c udsg for the various components. The c c , c udsg factors are used for the subtraction of the respective components. This procedure reduces the dependence on the normalization of the b hadron production and decay in the simulation because the expected shape of the secondary vertex mass distribution is used. In the case of the Z(2b) selection, as it can be seen in Fig. 1, the contamination from c and light-flavour jets is negligible and is subtracted using simulation; only the c bb scaling factor for the genuine double b jet component is determined from the fit, and it is used only to correct the relative proportion of Z(1b) and Z(2b) events in the simulation, as discussed in Sect. 6.",

For this purpose, the singular value decomposition (SVD) [46] unfolding technique, imple-mented in the RooUnfold toolkit [47], is used. The unfolding procedure is based on a response matrix, which describes the relationship between the particle levels and measured values of a given observable due to the detector resolution and acceptance. The response matrix is calculated using Z(1b) events that are generated with MadGraph in the 5FS, interfaced to pythia6, and followed by the detector simulation. Response matrices are computed separately for the Z(1b) and Z(2b) selections. The proportion of events with exactly one or at least two b quarks in the simulation is reweighted to match that observed in data, as determined by the c bb scaling factor. Fiducial cross sections are defined, based on event generator predictions at the particle level, for leptons and jets reconstructed from the collection of all stable final-state par-ticles, using the same selection criteria as the data analysis. The two leptons (electrons or muons) with the highest transverse momentum and with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are selected as Z boson decay products if their invariant mass is in the range of 71-111 GeV. Electromagnetic final-state radiation effects are taken into account in the generator-level lepton definition by clustering all photons in a cone of radius \u0394R = 0.1 around the final-state leptons. The leptons selected as Z boson decay products are then removed from the particle collection used for the jet clustering at the generator level. The remaining particles, excluding neutrinos, are clustered into jets using the anti-k t algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.5. Generated jets are selected if their distance from the leptons forming the Z boson candidate is larger than \u0394R = 0.5. Jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks are selected if a b hadron is an ancestor of one of the particles clustered in it, and this b hadron has a distance from the jet in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane of \u0394R \u2264 0.5.

Searches for physics processes beyond the SM in Lorentz-boosted topology events depend on precise knowledge of the Z boson p T distribution. The scalar sum H T of the transverse momenta of all selected jets, regardless of their flavour, is related to the structure of the hadronic system recoiling against the boson. The measurement of this observable at high values is potentially sensitive to the presence of intermediate heavy particles decaying hadronically, as predicted, for example, in some SUSY scenarios. Finally, the topology of the system composed of the Z boson and b jet is studied by measuring the cross section as a function of the azimuthal angular separation between the direction of the Z boson and the direction of the highestp T b jet, \u0394\u03c6 Zb .

The azimuthal angular separation \u0394\u03c6 bb between the directions of the two b jets in the transverse plane is useful to identify back-to-back configurations of the b quarks. The distance between the directions of the two b jets in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane is defined as \u0394R bb = \u221a (\u0394\u03b7 bb ) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6 bb ) 2 , where \u0394\u03b7 bb is the separation in pseudorapidity between the two b jets. This variable is sensitive to the different production mechanisms of the Z(2b) final-state b quarks. In particular, it is useful to discriminate between the contributions whose scattering amplitudes are dominated by terms involving gluon splitting, g \u2192 bb, and those where a Z boson is emitted from one of the final-state b quarks. The process qq \u2192 Zbb contributes to both cases, while qg \u2192 ZbbX (with X an additional parton) contributes to the former and      gg \u2192 Zbb to the latter. These contributions correspond, respectively, to the regions where the two b quarks are almost collinear or mostly acollinear. Because two b jets must be reconstructed, this measurement cannot be sensitive to lowangle gluon splitting, where the distance between the jetinitiating partons is smaller than twice the jet size. This region is better explored by searching directly for pairs of b hadrons close in space, as studied in Ref. [9], whose decay products might be part of a single reconstructed jet. Another angular observable of interest is \u0394R min Zb , the angular separation between the Z boson and the closer b jet in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane. This variable is useful for testing multileg tree-level and NLO corrections in which a Z boson is radiated from a quark, because it is sensitive to event topologies with the Z boson in the vicinity of one of the two b jets. Finally, the A Zbb asymmetry between the b jet direction and the Z boson direction is computed using a combination of \u0394R min Zb and \u0394R max Zb (the latter being the \u03b7-\u03c6 separation between the Z boson and the farther b jet):",

In pQCD the amplitude for this process can be computed using two alternative approaches. In the four-flavour scheme (4FS) [50], the b quark mass is explicitly included in the predictions and acts as an infrared cutoff, partly removing possible divergences in the matrix element calculation. This approach corresponds to an effective QCD theory, with n f = 4 quark flavours involved in the computation of the running of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S . In this scheme no b quark PDF is used, and the b quark is always produced explicitly by the gluon splitting g \u2192 bb process. In the 5FS [51] (where n f = 5), the gluon splitting contribution is included within the b quark PDF, and the b quark mass is set to zero in the matrix element calculation.

However, differences appear in fixed-order predictions, where the different ordering of terms in the matrix element expansion gives different results. The comparison of different flavour schemes is interesting because, in pQCD, the evolution of the b quark PDF as a function of the Bjorken x variable shows sizeable differences between tree-level calculations and those at NLO. These differences are introduced by singularities in the Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions that are present only at NLO; they have no impact on the tree-level evolution of the b quark PDF [52].",

A discrepancy of about 20% is seen in the overall normalization for the 4FS-based prediction, of the same order of magnitude as its estimated theoretical  Apart for the normalization difference, the pQCD calculation with massive b quarks (4FS) seems to reproduce, slightly better, the shape of the observed distributions in the soft momentum regime of b jets. For the leading b jet p T spectrum (Fig. 4), the ratio with data is reasonably flat below 80 GeV, whereas it presents a clear slope in the higher p T range. A similar behaviour is clear in the Z boson p T distribution below 130 GeV (Fig. 6) and in the H T spectrum below 200 GeV (Fig. 7). The powheg generator considerably overestimates the soft parts of the p T and H T spectra. The leading b jet |\u03b7| spectrum shape is well reproduced by the Mad-Graph 4FS configuration (Fig. 5), while MadGraph 5FS calculation slightly overestimates the central part of the spectrum. The shape of the distribution of the azimuthal angular separation \u0394\u03c6 Zb between the Z boson and the leading b jet is reproduced within uncertainties by all the calculations (Fig. 8). The NLO MadGraph5_aMC@NLO predictions have similar behaviour to those from LO MadGraph 5FS.

The pseudorapidity distribution (Fig. 5), with an almost flat shape, clearly shows that the ratio for the 4FS-based prediction is about 4%, compared to the 5% of the 5FS-based calculations, while powheg predicts about 6%. The 4FS prediction also fails to reproduce the ratio of the leading jet p T spectra (Fig. 4), which is clearly underestimated below 80 GeV. In contrast, powheg overestimates the spectrum in the soft region by about 30%. Similar discrepancies, although less pronounced, are observed for H T and the Z boson p T . The ratio as a function of the azimuthal separation between the Z boson and the b jet (Fig. 8) is also slightly underestimated by the MadGraph 4FS prediction when the Z boson is approximately back-to-back with respect to the leading b jet, with a difference in the azimuthal angles close to \u03c0 .  Within uncertainties, no global normalization discrepancy is observed, contrary to the Z(1b) case. The leading and subleading jet spectra are slightly underestimated in the soft region by the LO calculations (the leading b jet p T in the first two bins of Fig. 9 and the subleading b jet p T in the first bin of Fig. 10), while the Z boson p T distribution is well reproduced, within uncertainties (Fig. 11). The 4FS predictions overestimate the data at the high end of these p T distributions. The ratios of all theoretical predictions and the data show a slight positive slope for the azimuthal separation (Fig. 14). All the other distributions are well reproduced. In general, given the experimental uncertainties, the measurements do not strongly discriminate between the theoretical predictions. The ratio of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and powheg predictions based on NLO matrix elements with data shows a similar shape.",

The measured fiducial cross sections are compared to several theoretical predictions. The cross sections are measured as a function of various kinematic observables describing the event topology with a Z boson and at least one b jet: the p T and \u03b7 of the leading b jet, the Z boson p T , the scalar sum H T of the jet transverse momenta, and the azimuthal angular difference between the directions of the leading b jet and the Z boson. A comparison is made of the unfolded data with leading-order pQCD predictions based on matrix element calculations matched with parton showering, testing models using the MadGraph event generator, or with the NLO calculations, merging predictions for zero, one, and two extra jets with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, or for the first two jets with powheg in the minlo approach. In most cases the theoretical predictions agree with the data, although the normalization for MadGraph 4FS, which fails to describe simultaneously both the low-and highp T b jet regions, is underestimated by 20%. The ratios of differential cross sections for the production of a Z boson in association with at least one b jet and the inclusive Z+jets production are measured and compared with theoretical expectations. The 4FS-based prediction fails to describe the shape of the ratio as a function of the leading b jet p T , and discrepancies in the shape are also observed for high values of the Z boson p T .",

Within uncertainties, no global normalization discrepancy is observed, contrary to the Z(1b) case. The leading and subleading jet spectra are slightly underestimated in the soft region by the LO calculations (the leading b jet p T in the first two bins ofFig. 9and the subleading b jet p T in the first bin ofFig. 10), while the Z boson p T distribution is well reproduced, within uncertainties(Fig. 11). The 4FS predictions overestimate the data at the high end of these p T distributions. The ratios of all theoretical predictions and the data show a slight positive slope for the azimuthal separation(Fig. 14). All the other distributions are well reproduced. In general, given the experimental uncertainties, the measurements do not strongly discriminate between the theoretical predictions. The ratio of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and powheg predictions based on NLO matrix elements with data shows a similar shape.",
