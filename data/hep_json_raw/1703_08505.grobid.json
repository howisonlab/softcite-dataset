An amplitude analysis is performed in order to disentangle the various intermediate state contributions. To limit the model complexity a data driven regularization procedure is applied. The prominent contributions are the decay modes D 0 \u2192 a 1 (1260) + \u03c0 \u2212 , D 0 \u2192 \u03c3 f 0 (1370) and D 0 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c1(770) 0 . The broad resonances a 1 (1260) + , \u03c0(1300) + and a 1 (1640) + are studied in detail, including quasi-modelindependent parametrizations of their lineshapes. The mass and width of the a 1 (1260) + meson are determined to be m a 1 (1260) + = [1225 \u00b1 9 (stat) \u00b1 17 (syst) \u00b1 10 (model)] MeV/c 2 and \u0393 a 1 (1260) + = [430 \u00b1 24 (stat) \u00b1 25 (syst) \u00b1 18 (model)] MeV. The amplitude model of D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays obtained from CLEO II.V, CLEO III, and CLEO-c data is revisited with improved lineshape parametrizations. The largest components are the decay modes",

Figure 1 shows the dominant processes that contribute to the visible structure in the phase space. The color-favored tree diagram manifests as a cascade whereby a resonance decays into another resonance before decaying into the final state. Due to the identical quark content produced in the weak and spectator interactions, a given process and its CP -conjugate may arise even from the same initial state. Such processes, which we refer to as non-self-conjugate, are also known as flavor-non-specific decays as flavor-tagging is required to distinguish between the source of these two partners despite not being CP eigenstates. The color-suppressed tree diagram and the W -exchange diagram result in self-conjugate intermediate states such as \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c1(770) 0 or \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c6(1020) whose partial waves are eigenstates of CP . Certain intermediate states in D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, for instance K * (892) 0K * (892) 0 , are only accessible via the W -exchange diagram.",

For this reason, we follow an iterative approach. The initial amplitude fit, described in section 6, is performed using an energy-dependent width distribution derived from an uniform phase space population. Afterwards, the energy-dependent JHEP05(2017)143  width is recalculated with the results of the substructure analysis and the amplitude fit is subsequently repeated with the new propagator. It is found that the energy-dependent width is not highly sensitive to the details of the Dalitz plot as this procedure converges after a few iterations. As the a 1 (1260) resonance is very broad, the dispersive term is calculated as well. Figure 4 shows the final iteration of the energy-dependent width and mass. The energy-dependent width varies strongly around s \u2248 0.8 GeV 2 where the energy of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 subsystem is equal to the \u03c1(770) 0 on-shell mass. Around s = 2 GeV 2 , a small hump develops due to the opening of the KK\u03c0 channel. The energy-dependent mass indeed shows a plateau around the nominal mass as expected. Note that as the condition of eq. (4.16) is not explicitly enforced by eq. (4.15), it serves as an independent check of whether the main thresholds have been included [38,47].",

Afterwards, the spin and orbital angular momentum tensors are properly contracted with the polarization vector of the decaying particle to give a Lorentz scalar.

As we consider this as unphysical we do not include it in our default approach but in an alternative model presented in appendix D. In addition, we repeated the model selection procedure under multiple different conditions: From that we obtained a set of alternative models shown in appendix D. Due to the vast number of potential amplitude components and computational limits imposed by the consideration of multiple data samples in the D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 analysis, a staged LASSO method using only the flavor-tagged data, representing over 90% of the available statistics, is employed. The approach taken is based on the assumption that the signal decay proceeds primarily by doubly resonant decays, i.e. cascade and quasi-two-body decays, rather than decay amplitudes with non-resonant components. In Stage 1, only doubly resonant decays along with the simplest non-resonant component (K + K \u2212 ) S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) S are considered. Figure 5(b) shows a plot of the complexity factor \u03bb, against the resulting BIC values.

The interpolated cubic spline has to pass through independent complex knots spaced in the m 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) region around the nominal mass. The position of the knots is chosen ad-hoc. We verified on simulated experiments that with this choice a Breit-Wigner lineshape can be properly reproduced, given there is a real resonance. The fitted magnitudes and phases of the knots are shown in figure 8, where the expectations from a Breit-Wigner shape with the mass and width from the nominal fit are superimposed taking only the statistical uncertainties on the mass and width into account. The interpolated spline generally reproduces the features of the Breit-Wigner parametrization. In particular, the resulting JHEP05(2017)143  Argand diagram shows a circular, counter-clockwise trajectory which is the expected behavior of a resonance. Note that the high-mass tail of the a 1 (1640) is outside of the phase space boundary such that it is not possible to investigate the full phase motion. Similar quasi-model-independent studies are performed for the a 1 (1260) and \u03c0(1300) resonances as shown in figures 9 and 10, respectively. Since the investigated resonances are all very broad, the quasi-model-independent lineshapes can absorb statistical fluctuations in the data, especially near the phase space boundaries. Therefore, the agreement with the Breit-Wigner expectation in all cases indicates that it is qualitatively reasonable that these resonances are indeed real features of the data.",

[13], but only 28.1% in our current analysis. This is because of our modified description of the V V D-wave. In ref. [13], the component labeled as D-wave is  a superposition of D and S waves, a choice which was motivated by the convention used in four-body amplitude analyses at the time. This led to a large interference between the components labeled as S wave and D wave of -15.7%. In this analysis, as we parametrize a pure D-wave, we find an interference fraction between the \u03c6(1020) \u03c1(770) 0 S-and D-waves of -3.7%. Taking these interference fractions into account, the combined \u03c6(1020) \u03c1(770) 0 Sand D-wave fraction of 26% is therefore consistent between both analyses. In contrast to ref. [13], we also find a small, but significant \u03c6(1020) \u03c1(770) 0 P -wave component. Another difference in the two-resonance topology is in the K * (892) 0K * (892) 0 mode, where our results indicate a significant P -and D-wave contribution, while in ref. [13], only an S-JHEP05(2017)143 wave contribution was observed. Note though, that model 6 in ref. [13] has a P -wave in the K * (892) (K\u03c0) P decay of a similar size as our K * (892) 0K * (892) 0 P -wave. The largest differences in our results are, as might be expected, in the cascade topology, because of the significant changes we implemented to improve the description of the lineshapes of resonance decays to three-body final states. We find that the process D 0 \u2192 K * * + K \u2212 , where K * * represents any excited kaon, dominates over D 0 \u2192 K * * \u2212 K + , analogous to the dominance of D 0 \u2192 a 1 (1260) + \u03c0 \u2212 over D 0 \u2192 a 1 (1260) \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. In ref. [13], this was only the case for the K(1270) \u2192 K * (890) \u03c0 amplitude. We also observe a significant K(1270) \u2192 K * (1430) \u03c0 component in agreement with ref.",

The uncertainty due to both the signal fraction and the wrong tag probabilities in the flavor-tagged samples are estimated by repeating the fit and allowing them to vary under Gaussian constraints. The signal fraction uncertainty for the CP -tagged sample is determined by fixing the fraction to unity and repeating the fit. Various assumptions made on the acceptance in the fit model are also considered. As the acceptance comes from MC, we account for differences between data and MC arising from tracking and particle identification as a function of momentum of the daughter particles.

In D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , their impact is studied by recalculating the width considering only decays into the \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 (\u03c0\u03c0) final state for three-body (two-body) resonances. For D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the energydependent widths of the three-body resonances are recalculated assuming a flat phase space distribution. Similarly, the energy-dependent mass of the a 1 (1260) resonance is approximated by a constant and the resulting shifts of the fit parameters are assigned as systematic errors.",

Due to the large amount of possible intermediate resonance components, a model-building procedure has been applied which balances the fit quality against the number of free fit parameters. The prominent contribution is found to be the a 1 (1260) resonance in the decay modes a 1 (1260) \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c0 and a 1 (1260) \u2192 \u03c3 \u03c0. Along with the a 1 (1260), further cascade decays involving the resonances \u03c0(1300) and a 1 (1640) are also seen. The masses and widths of these resonances are determined using an advanced lineshape parametrization taking into account the resonant three-pion substructure. The resonant phase motion of these states has been verified by means of a quasi-model-independent study. In addition to these cascade topologies, there is a significant contribution from the quasi-two-body decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c1(770) 0 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c3 f 0 (1370). The CP -even fraction of the decay D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 as predicted by the amplitude model is consistent with a previous model-independent study. The amplitude model has also been used to search for CP violation in D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, where no CP violation among the amplitudes is observed within the given precision of a few percent.",

It is re-assuring to see that the results we obtain without these constraints are consistent with what one would expect if such constraints had been applied (cf. model A in table20).
