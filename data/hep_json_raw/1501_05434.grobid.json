At KLOE, the study of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 process is currently going to be finalized. At present, about 9000 events have been selected from a data sample of 1.7 fb \u22121 from 2004/2005 data taking campaign. A very good agreement between data and Monte Carlo distributions has been achieved for all interesting kinematical variables. A preliminary invariant-mass spectrum of e + e \u2212 is presented.",

They play an important role in many fields of particle physics, such as the calculation of the hadronic Light-by-Light contribution to the Standard Model value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the search for quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions. Moreover, meson TFF represent a strong \"benchmark\" for theoretical modelling of different processes, being a field in which high precision measurements are possible.",
