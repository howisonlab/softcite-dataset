Current knowledge of the masses of the D + and D + s mesons, and the mass splitting between these states, is more limited. The most precise determination of the D + mass is made by the KEDR collaboration [6] resulting in M (D + ) = 1869.53 \u00b1 0.49 (stat) \u00b1 0.20 (syst) MeV/c 2 . In addition, two measurements of the mass splitting between the D + and D 0 mesons by the MRK2 [7] and LGW [8] collaborations have been reported. These are averaged [4] to give M (D + ) \u2212 M (D 0 ) = 4.76 \u00b1 0.28 MeV/c 2 . No absolute measurement of the D + s mass with a precision better than the MeV/c 2 level exists and the reported values are not in good agreement [4]. More precise measurements of the mass difference relative to the D + meson have been reported by several collaborations [9][10][11][12][13]. These are averaged [4]  The fit of open charm mass data [4] leads to M (D + s ) = 1968.49 \u00b1 0.32 MeV/c 2 . Though this value is significantly more precise than the direct measurement, it would still dominate the systematic uncertainty on the measurement of the B + c mass in the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8D + s decay mode [14].",

Though the prompt sample is larger in size, cuts on the decay time of the D meson are applied at the trigger level to reduce the output rate.

The larger of the differences to the default fit result is assigned as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty. Similarly the effect of the background modelling is estimated by replacing the exponential function with a first-order Chebychev polynomial. The shifts of the mass values observed in these tests are generally much smaller than 0.01 MeV/c 2 and are assigned as systematic uncertainties.
