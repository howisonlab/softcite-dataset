The search is mainly based on the response of the ring imaging Cherenkov detectors to distinguish the heavy, slow-moving particles from muons. No evidence is found for the production of such long-lived states. The results are expressed as limits on the Drell-Yan production of pairs of long-lived particles, with both particles in the LHCb pseudorapidity acceptance, 1.8 < \u03b7 < 4.9. The mass-dependent cross-section upper limits are in the range 2-4 fb (at 95 % CL) for masses between 14 and 309 GeV/c 2 .",

            "text": "Several extensions of the Standard Model (SM) propose the existence of charged massive stable particles (CMSP). Stable particles, in this context, are long-lived particles that can travel through a detector without decaying. These particles can have long lifetimes for a variety of reasons, e.g. a new (approximately) conserved quantum number, a weak coupling or a limited phase space in any allowed decay. In supersymmetric (SUSY) models, CMSPs can be sleptons ( ), charginos, or R-hadrons. R-hadrons are colourless states combining squarks ( q) or gluinos ( g) and SM quarks or gluons. In the gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) model [1][2][3] the breakdown of SUSY is mediated by gauge interactions and can occur at a relatively low energy scale. For a particular range of parameter space in the minimal model (mGMSB) the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle can be a long-lived stau ( \u03c4 1 ), with a mass of the order of 100 GeV/c 2 or higher. The \u03c4 1 is the lightest mass eigenstate, resulting from the mixture of right-handed and e-mail: aurelio.bay@epfl.ch left-handed superpartners of the \u03c4 , dominated by the righthanded component.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (the vertex locator, VELO) surrounding the proton-proton interaction region [15], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [16] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p , of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5 % at low momentum to 1.0 % at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [17].",

For illustration, the \u03b2 spectrum is shown in Fig. 1, for two values of the CMSP mass, at centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The effects of such delayed detection on the efficiencies of the subdetectors are determined from simulation in which the timing information is modelled according to dedicated electronic measurements and tests in beam. The muon chambers have the largest inef-ficiency for slow-particle reconstruction. The maximal delay for a particle to be accepted by the front-end electronics is 12.5 ns [17]. In the most downstream muon chamber, this delay corresponds to the arrival of a particle with \u03b2 = 0.83. To be identified as a muon, the charged particle must be associated with hits in the last four muon chambers, a requirement that particles with \u03b2 < 0.8 fail to meet. The large time-offlight can also bias the reconstructed position of the particle passing through the tracker straw tubes, which accept a maximal drift-time of about 35 ns for tracks passing close to the straw radius of 2.5 mm [16]. These combined effects result in a vanishingly small reconstruction efficiency for particles with \u03b2 < 0.8 but an efficiency above 95 % if \u03b2 > 0.95, as shown in Fig. 1.",

The mGMSB model has six parameters [2,3]: the SUSY breaking scale ( ), the mass scale of the SUSY loop messengers (M m ), the number of messenger supermultiplets (N 5 ), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral Higgs fields (tan \u03b2), the sign of the Higgs mass parameter (\u03bc), and the parameter C grav , which affects the gravitino mass.

The Cherenkov momentum thresholds for muons, protons, and CMSPs with masses of 124 and 309 GeV/c 2 , are given in Table 3 for the three radiators in the LHCb detectors. Only CMSP candidates with momenta above 200 GeV/c are considered. For this momentum range, particles with masses of the order of MeV/c 2 to GeV/c 2 , have Cherenkov angles very close to the saturation value arccos(1/(n\u03b2)), where n is the refractive index of the medium. The fraction of CMSPs with momentum above 2 TeV/c is negligible, and the CMSPs are therefore expected not to produce Cherenkov radiation in the gaseous radiators. Around half of the 124 GeV/c 2 CMSPs have a momentum above the Cherenkov threshold for aerogel, and Cherenkov angles smaller than the saturation value. This allows them to be separated from the background. Only a few percent are expected to be in the momentum range 1.4-2.0 TeV/c, corresponding to Cherenkov angles from 0.225 to 0.234 rad. It is possible to distinguish these angles from the saturation value of 0.242 rad in the aerogel as the angular resolution is about 5.6 mrad.

The DLLx distribution is shown in Fig. 4a for muons from data and simulated Z decays. 1 An anomalous signature in the RICH detectors could also be produced by tracks with wrongly assigned momenta. This can happen if the particle has an absolute electric charge that is different from the proton charge. For instance, a 1 GeV/c 2 proton-like particle is expected to produce Cherenkov light in the two gaseous radiators when the measured momentum is above 30 GeV/c.

The small difference is due to a change in the underlying event and some light from the aerogel for the 124 GeV/c 2 case. A clear separation between the signal and background muon DLLx distributions is observed. The difference in the data and simulated muon distributions is mainly due to the lack of precision in the mapping of the photon detection efficiency in the RICH system. In particular, the peak at DLLx > \u22125 is produced by the decrease of the photon detection efficiency when approaching boundaries in the RICH modules. The simulation only partially reproduces this behaviour and the number of candidates above DLLx = \u22125 is too low by around a factor of two. To compensate for this, 15 % of simulated muon events with DLLx falling close to zero have been shifted by an ad hoc value to obtain the best agreement between data and simulation in the DLLx > \u22125 region, resulting in the distribution shown in Fig. 4b. It is expected that a correct efficiency map should produce such a shift, moving above zero the slightly negative DLLx values. This set of simulated background events is used to train the ANN. Note that only candidates with DLLx > \u22125 are used in the ANN. In  order to assess the systematic uncertainty associated to this correction method, two other procedures are considered. In the first procedure, the ANN training is performed on the original background simulated data set. In the second, the DLLx values for each muon are randomly chosen following a set of templates inferred from the DLLx data distributions as function of p and \u03b7. Despite the fact that this operation is done in bins of p and \u03b7, it is obvious that most of the correlation is lost in the randomisation process. The three methods are found to provide the same final discrimination power and their contributions to the systematic uncertainties are small. This is due to the strong separation between signal and background that is provided intrinsically by the DLLx variable.",

            "text": "A search for pairs of long-lived charged particles, with masses in the range 124-309 GeV/c 2 , using \u03c4 1 pairs predicted by the mGMSB model as a benchmark scenario, is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 , collected with the LHCb detector in the forward pseudorapidity range 1.8 < \u03b7 < 4.9. The candidates are assumed to interact only through the electroweak interaction in the detector. Hence, they behave like heavy muons and their main signature is the absence of a signal in the RICH detectors. The detection efficiency is limited to particles with \u03b2 > 0.8 due to the acceptance in time after beam crossing. The main background contribution comes from Z/\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and is reduced to less than \u223c0.02 events. No events have been observed. Upper limits are set on the Drell-Yan CMSP pair production cross-section. For proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the 95 % CL upper limits for the production crosssection of a pair of CMSPs in the LHCb acceptance vary from 6.1 fb for a mass of 124 GeV/c 2 up to 10.7 fb for a mass of 309 GeV/c 2 . At \u221a s = 8 TeV, they vary from 3.4 to 5.7 fb for the same masses.",
