The measurements are performed with a dimuon data sample collected in 2011 by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb \u22121 . The results are extracted from the dimuon decay angular distributions, in two ranges of \u03d2(nS) transverse momentum (10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15), and in the rapidity interval |y| < 1.2. The results do not show significant changes from low-to high-multiplicity pp collisions, although large uncertainties preclude definite statements in the \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) cases.",

            "text": "Studies of heavy-quarkonium production contribute to an improved understanding of hadron formation within the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1]. Quarkonium production is expected to proceed in two steps [2]. First, a heavy quarkantiquark pair, QQ, is produced, with angular momentum L and spin S. Then this \"pre-resonance\" binds into the measured quarkonium state through a nonperturbative evolution that may change L and/or S. The short-distance QQ production cross sections are functions of the QQ momentum and are calculated in perturbative QCD [3][4][5][6], while the probabilities that QQ pairs of different quantum properties form the observed quarkonium state are parametrized by momentum-independent long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). Since they are expected to scale with powers of the heavy-quark velocity squared, v 2 , in the nonrelativistic limit (v 2 1) most LDMEs are negligible and S-wave vector quarkonia should be dominantly formed from QQ pairs produced as coloursinglet, 3 S [1] 1 , or as one of the 1 S [8] 0 , 3 S [8] 1 and 3 P [8] J colour-octet states. While the colour-singlet LDME can be calculated with potential models, the others, reflecting the complexity of the evolution of a coloured QCD system into a formed hadron, are determined through phenomenological analyses of quarkonium production data [3][4][5][6][7].

However, cross section and polarization measurements at high transverse momentum, p T , are currently limited to pp collisions, so that the LDME universality hypothesis remains a nontrivial assumption requiring direct experimental investigation. Since the nonperturbative quarkonium formation process involves interactions with the QCD medium surrounding the QQ state, allowing it to neutralize its net colour through emission or absorption of soft gluons, it is important to verify if the polarizations (directly related to the LDMEs) depend on the complexity of the hadronic environment created by the collision. Probing if the polarizations are affected by an increase in the multiplicity of particles produced in pp collisions, the topic of the present analysis, is a first step in such a study, to be followed by analogous investigations using proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus data collected at different collision centralities. Such studies are crucial for a reliable interpretation of the quarkonium suppression patterns seen in high-energy http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.065 0370-2693/\u00a9 2016 The Author(s).

The y axis of the polarization frame is reversed between positive and negative rapidity, a definition that avoids the cancellation of \u03bb \u03d1\u03d5 when integrating events over a symmetrical range in rapidity. This is explained in Ref. [16], which provides a pedagogical introduction to quarkonium polarization physics. As in the previous CMS quarkonium polarization measurements [13,17], the analysis is exclusively based on measured data: the 3-momentum vectors of the two muons (containing the spin alignment information of the decaying \u03d2(nS) mesons) and the muon detection efficiencies.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured with drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. The main detectors used in this analysis are the silicon tracker and the muon system, which enable the measurement of muon momenta over the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [18]. The events were collected using a two-level trigger system. The first level uses custom hardware processors to select events with two muons. The high-level trigger, adding information from the silicon tracker, selects opposite-sign muon pairs of invariant mass 8.5 < M < 11.5 GeV, |y| < 1.25 and p T > 5 or 7 GeV (depending on the instantaneous luminosity); the dimuon vertex fit \u03c7 2 probability must exceed 0.5% and the two muons must have a distance of closest approach smaller than 5 mm. Although the trigger logic does not reject events on the basis of the p T of the single muons, at mid-rapidity the bending induced by the magnetic field prevents muons of p T smaller than \u223c3 GeV from reaching the muon stations.",

They must have a good track fit quality, point to the interaction region, and match the muon objects that triggered the event. The selected muons are required to satisfy |\u03b7| < 1.6 and to have p T above 4.5, 3.5, and 3 GeV for |\u03b7| < 1.2, 1.2 < |\u03b7| < 1.4, and 1.4 < |\u03b7| < 1.6, respectively, to ensure reliable detection and trigger efficiencies. The combinatorial background from uncorrelated muons is suppressed by requiring a dimuon vertex fit \u03c7 2 probability larger than 1% and by rejecting events where the distance between the dimuon vertex and the primary vertex is larger than twice its resolution. In events with multiple reconstructed primary vertices (pileup), the one nearest to the point of closest approach between the trajectory of the dimuon and the beam line is selected. The N ch variable is computed by counting \"high purity\" [19] charged tracks, excluding the two muons, of |\u03b7| < 2.4, p T > 500 MeV, and p T measured with better than 10% relative accuracy. Acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies are not corrected for. Each track is assigned a weight reflecting the likelihood that it belongs to the primary vertex [19]; tracks consistent with the vertex have a weight close to unity. The migration of events from one N ch bin to the next, caused by inadvertently counting spurious tracks produced in near-by pileup vertices, is kept negligible by rejecting events with more than 16 vertices. Fig. 1 shows the N ch distribution of the events selected in this analysis.",

For each effect, the systematic uncertainty is the difference between the injected and resulting parameters. The robustness of the framework to measure the signal polarization is validated for several signal and background polarization scenarios. The impact of residual biases that could be caused by uncertainties on the muon or dimuon efficiencies is evaluated by extracting the polarization parameters after applying corresponding variations to the input efficiencies. The background model uncertainty is evaluated by modifying the relative weights of the low-and high-mass sidebands when building the background distributions. A broad range of hypotheses is considered, including the assumption that the background under the \u03d2(1S) (\u03d2(3S)) peak resembles exclusively the low-mass (high-mass) sideband, or assuming that it is reproduced by an equal mixture of the two sideband distributions. Several systematic uncertainties have similar levels, except in the highest N ch bins and the lowest p T range, where the background model uncertainty dominates, especially for the \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) states. For the \u03d2(1S) state and in the HX frame, the N ch -dependent systematic uncertainties are \u223c0.1 for \u03bb \u03d1 and \u223c0.03-0.05 for \u03bb \u03d5 and \u03bb \u03d1\u03d5 , slightly increasing with N ch .

            "text": "1 octet, at high enough p T ). The four curves represent different variations with N ch (linearly in the 0 < N ch < 60 range) of the fraction of events, f , produced through the latter process (defined in the legends). These curves were computed knowing that the polarization of a sample of quarkonium states produced through two different processes, of polarizations \u03bb 0 and \u03bb 1 , depends on f as [25]  Changes in the LDMEs, in particular of the dominant 1 S [8] 0 and 3 S [8] 1 octet terms [7], are not the only possible cause of variations in the measured \u03d2(nS) \u03bb parameters between low-and highmultiplicity pp collisions; the effects of feed-down decays from heavier quarkonia should also be considered. In fact, the polarizations reported here correspond to inclusive \u03d2(nS) samples, not distinguishing mesons emitted in the decays of S-and P-wave bottomonium states from the directly-produced ones. Assuming that all directly-produced S-wave states have identical polarizations, their decays to lighter S-wave states do not induce differences between the measured (inclusive) polarizations and those of the directly-produced mesons. On the contrary, feed-down decays from P-wave states can significantly affect the measured values, especially for the \u03d2(1S) state, presumably the one affected by the largest feed-down fraction. It is presently not possible to reliably evaluate the influence of the feed-down decays on the measured \u03d2(nS) polarizations, for lack of information regarding the \u03c7 b polarizations and their feed-down fractions. Fig. 6-bottom shows how the measured (inclusive) polarization is expected to change as a function of N ch if the directly-produced component (of polarization \u03bb 0 ) is complemented by a feed-down component (of polarization \u03bb 1 ) that contributes with a fraction f , decreasing linearly with N ch from 50% to 0 in the 0 < N ch < 60 range. The six curves correspond to different assumptions for \u03bb 0 and \u03bb 1 , reported in the legends, with \u03bb 1 representing an effective average of the \u03c7 b1 and \u03c7 b2 polarizations (the \u03c7 b1 and \u03c7 b2 \u03bb \u03d1 values must verify \u03bb \u03d1 > \u22121/3 and \u03bb \u03d1 > \u22123/5, respectively [25]). In these scenarios the feed-down fraction is assumed to become negligible at high N ch , where the inclusive \u03bb \u03d1 tends to the direct \u03bb 0 value. At low N ch , where the feed-down contribution is, hypothetically, the highest, the inclusive \u03bb \u03d1 parameter crucially depends on the assumed \u03c7 b polarization. ",
