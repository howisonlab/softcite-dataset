            "text": "The J/\u03c8 resonance, a bound state of cc quarks, was discovered more than forty years ago but its investigation is still actual. Fundamental properties of this meson including the branching fractions of leptonic and hadronic decays are important for understanding the quarkonium decay dynamics. The leptonic width of the J/\u03c8 meson is used in calculations of c-quark mass [1,2] and the hadronic contribution to the muon g \u2212 2 [3]. It is also used for various calculations of radiative corrections due to the vacuum polarization and the initial-state radiation. The current precision of \u0393 ee in the potential models and in the lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations [4,5] is compatible with that of the world-average value [6] and increase of the experimental precision for this value can be crucial for further development of the LQCD calculation techniques. Measurements of the J/\u03c8 widths have a long history. They were studied at MarkI [7] and ADONE [8], and later at BES [9], BaBar [10], CLEO [11], KEDR [12,13] and BESIII [14]. Usually \u0393 ee is measured in J/\u03c8 decays to hadrons, e + e \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final states and the obtained value is the product of \u0393 ee to the corresponding branching fraction. At present the best accuracy in the determination of \u0393 ee has been obtained by the BESIII collaboration [14] based on the \u0393 ee \u2022 B \u00b5\u00b5 (J/\u03c8) measurement in the initial-state radiation process e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 and B \u00b5\u00b5 (J/\u03c8) branching fraction [6]. The best accuracy of the \u0393 ee \u2022 B hadrons value has been reached by combining the result on \u0393 ee [6] with B hadrons from BES [9].",

Assume that we have a perfect simulation procedure capable of reproducing all event characteristics and correlations between them, but it has a set of internal parameters to be tuned. By varying one of the parameters, one should trace the change of the mean value of some observable, for example the mean multiplicity N IP , and the detection efficiency \u03b5. The simulated value of the observable coincides with the measured one at the optimal setting of the parameter. For small variations the detection efficiency linearly depends on the mean multiplicity, therefore the accuracy of the efficiency determination \u03b4\u03b5 = \u2202\u03b5/\u2202 N IP \u03b4 N IP , where \u03b4 N IP is the uncertainty of the experimental value of the multiplicity. In case of several simulation parameters to vary, one should get the set of \u03b5(N IP ) trajectories crossing together at the point which corresponds to an experimental observable. In practice, the simulation procedure is not perfect, thus instead of one intersection point we have the situation depicted in figure 6. The uncertainty of the detection efficiency grows due to difference in trajectory slopes obtained with variations of simulation parameters. The estimate of the uncertainty interval corresponds to the vertical size of the shadow box in figure 6 while the horizontal size is determined by the track multiplicity uncertainty in the experiment.  Figure 6. Detection efficiency dependence on charged multiplicity for different versions of the J/\u03c8 decay simulation. The solid lines correspond to variation of the selected parameters. The dotted line corresponds to the experimental measured charged multiplicity and the rectangular shadow box shows its statistical error. The vertical limits of the shadow box correspond to fit lines crossing the data statistical bounds.",
