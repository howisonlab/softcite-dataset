The analysis is carried out for three center-of-mass energies \u221a s = 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations e \u2212 L e + R and e \u2212 R e + L , for which the polarizations of e \u2212 and e + are P e \u2212 , P e + =(\u221280%, +30%) and (+80%, \u221230%), respectively. Assuming an integrated luminosity of 250 fb \u22121 for each beam polarization at \u221a s = 250 GeV, where the best lepton momentum resolution is obtainable, \u03c3ZH and MH can be determined with a precision of 2.5% and 37 MeV for e \u2212 L e + R and 2.9% and 41 MeV for e \u2212 R e + L , respectively. Regarding a 20 year ILC physics program, the expected precisions for the HZZ coupling and MH are estimated to be 0.4% and 14 MeV, respectively. The event selection is designed to optimize the precisions of \u03c3ZH and MH while minimizing the bias on the measured \u03c3ZH due to discrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs decay modes. For the first time, model independence has been demonstrated to a sub-percent level for the \u03c3ZH measurement at each of the three center-of-mass energies. The results presented show the impact of center-of-mass energy and beam polarization on the evaluated precisons and serve as a benchmark for the planning of the ILC run scenario.",

            "text": "It is one of the most important missions of high energy particle physics to uncover the physics behind electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). The discovery of the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 [1,2] proved the basic idea of the SM that the vacuum filled with the Higgs condensate broke the electroweak symmetry. The SM assumes one doublet of complex scalar fields for the Higgs sector. However, apart from the fact that it is the simplest, there is no reason to prefer the Higgs sector in the SM over any other model that is consistent with experiments. Moreover, the SM does not explain why the Higgs field became condensed in vacuum. To answer this question, we need physics beyond the SM (\"BSM\") which necessarily alters the properties of the Higgs boson. Each new physics model predicts its own size and pattern of the deviations of Higgs boson properties from their SM predictions. In order to discriminate these new physics models, we need to measure with high precision as many types of couplings as possible and as model independently as possible. Because the deviations predicted by most new physics models are typically no larger than a few percent, the coupling measurements must achieve a precision of 1% or better for a statistically significant measurement. This level of sensitivity is available only in the clean experimental environment of lepton colliders.",

            "text": "Most of the Higgs boson measurements at the LHC are of cross section times branching ratio (BR). This is also true at the ILC with one important exception, the measurement of the absolute size of an inclusive Higgs production cross section by applying the recoil technique to the Higgsstrahlung process e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH. The recoil technique involves measuring only the momenta of the decay products of the Z boson which recoils against the Higgs boson, and hence in principle is independent of the Higgs decay mode. The measurement of this cross section \u03c3 ZH is indispensable for extracting the branching ratios, the Higgs total width, and couplings from cross section times branching ratio measurements. The recoil technique, which is only possible at a lepton collider owing to the well-known initial state, is applicable even if the Higgs boson decays invisibly and hence allows us to determine \u03c3 ZH in a completely model independent way. The recoil technique also provides one of the most precise measurements of the Higgs boson mass (M H ), which is necessary for estimating the phase space factor for the HWW * decay to extract the Higgs total width.",

            "text": "Especially high precision measurements of \u03c3 ZH and M H are possible by applying the recoil technique to Higgsstrahlung events where the Z boson decays to a pair of electrons or muons, which profits from excellent tracking momentum resolution and relatively low background levels. Furthermore, in this channel model independence for the measurement of \u03c3 ZH can be demonstrated in practice. This paper reports a study which evaluates the performance of measuring \u03c3 ZH and M H using the Higgsstrahlung process with a Z boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH \u2192 l + l \u2212 H ( l = e or \u00b5). One of the major purposes of this study is to quantify the impact of center of mass energy and beam polarization on the precision of \u03c3 ZH and M H ; the analysis is carried out for three center-of-mass energies (250, 350, and 500 GeV), as well as two beam polarizations (P e \u2212 , P e + ) =(\u221280%, +30%) and (+80%, \u221230%), which will be denoted as e \u2212 L e + R and e \u2212 R e + L , respectively. [5] Unless otherwise specified, the total integrated luminosity is assumed as follows: For each beam polarization 250 fb \u22121 , 333 fb \u22121 , and 500 fb \u22121 are accumulated for \u221a s = 250, 350, and 500 GeV, respectively. The H20 program [6], one of the currently proposed ILC run scenarios which covers startup, energy stages, and a luminosity upgrade, designates that during a 20 year period, a total of 2000, 200, and 4000 fb \u22121 will be accumulated at \u221a s= 250, 350, and 500 GeV, respectively. The analysis results in this paper will be scaled to the luminosities of the H20 program, and will impact the planning of future updates of the run scenario.",

The signal selection efficiency, and hence the production cross section is, in principle, independent of how the Higgs boson decays, since only the leptons from the Z decay need to be measured in the recoil technique. In practice, however, this is not guaranteed since there is a possibility of confusion between the leptons from the Z boson decay and those from the Higgs boson decay.

Although the E vis cut also excludes signal events in which the Higgs boson decays invisibly, Higgs decay model independence is maintained by combining the results obtained from this analysis with a dedicated analysis for invisible Higgs decays [24,25]. This is explained by the fact that the ZH cross section for the SM Higgs boson can be expressed as \u03c3 ZH = \u03c3 ZH,vis +\u03c3 ZH,invis , where \u03c3 ZH,vis and \u03c3 ZH,invis , which are the cross sections of the visible and invisible decay events, respectively, can both be measured individually and model independently. of the signal and major residual background processes, which are 4f_sl and 2f_l defined in Section III C. Figures 10 -12 show the reconstructed M rec spectra of the events remaining in a wide region around the signal M rec peak for all three center-of-mass energies. Only the plots for e \u2212 L e + R are shown for \u221a s=350 and 500 GeV for the sake of brevity. The following can be observed:",

            "text": "From the above formulation, it is apparent that the key to maintaining model independence is to minimize the discrepancies in signal efficiency between decay modes. This is exactly the guideline for designing the data selection methods in Section IV, while still allowing them to achieve high precision of \u03c3 ZH and M H . To cover a large number of Higgs decay modes and monitor their efficiencies, high statistics signal samples (\u223c 40k events) are produced for each major SM decay mode (H \u2192 bb, cc, gg, \u03c4 \u03c4 , WW * , ZZ * , \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3Z), and for each beam polarisation and center-of-mass energy, so that the relative statistical error of each efficiency is below 0.2% in the end for any channel. As for the analysis strategies, from the very beginning, the isolated lepton selection mentioned in Section IV A 1 is tuned to take into account the fact that each decay mode has a different density of particles surrounding the leptons from Z boson decay. Then, as explained in Section IV A 2, the isolated leptons are carefully paired to minimize the chance of including leptons from Higgs decay into the pair [21]. Following these signal selection processes, the cuts on M l + l \u2212 , p l + l \u2212 T , BDT, and M rec are designed to use only kinematical information from the selected leptons so as to avoid introducing bias to the efficiencies of individual Higgs decay modes. Even though the cos (\u03b8 missing ) cut, which counts the missing momentum from the whole event but, in principle uses information of particles from Higgs decay, it is designed to be so loose that there is almost no effect on signal efficiency, while 2-fermion backgrounds can still be suppressed effectively. The E vis cut will not introduce additional bias either, as it simply categorizes the events into visible or invisible Higgs decay, as mentioned in Section IV C. More details on the data selection strategies regarding model independence can be found in [21]. Table  IX shows the efficiencies of each decay mode after each cut for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 H channel at \u221a s=250 GeV. Table IX shows no discrepancy in efficiencies beyond 1%, which demonstrates model independence at a level of better than 0.5% based on the most conservative scenario B. The bias is even smaller at higher center-of-mass energies [21]. For example, at \u221a s=500 GeV, no bias ex- ists beyond the MC statistical error (< 0.2%) for any mode. Regarding the most realistic scenario C, the estimation of potential bias is obtained as follows (using Equations 10 and 11). The known modes are assumed to be H \u2192 bb, cc, gg, \u03c4 \u03c4 , WW * , ZZ * , \u03b3\u03b3, and \u03b3Z, since they will be measured at the LHC or the ILC [29,30]. The total branching ratio for the unknown modes (B x ) is assumed to be 10%, based on the estimation of the 95% C.L. upper limit for branching ratio of BSM decay modes from the HL-LHC [29]. In fact this assumption is rather conservative, because at the ILC the upper limit for BSM decay will be greatly improved and in general any decay mode with a few percent branching ratio shall be directly measured. Since the characteristics of any exotic decay mode are expected to fall within the wide range of known decay modes being directly investigated, we obtain \u03b4\u03b5 max by assuming that the efficiencies of the unknown modes will lie in the range of the efficiencies of known modes; this is, for example, -0.68% from the \u03b3Z mode in the case of the channel shown in Table IX. Then for the known modes, each B i is scaled from their SM values by 90%, following which \u03b5 0 is obtained straightforwardly from B i and i . Each \u2206B i is taken conservatively from the largest uncertainties predicted from the HL-LHC measurements [29] with exceptions of the H \u2192 cc and gg modes which are \u221a s 250 GeV 350 GeV 500 GeV l + l \u2212 H \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X e + e \u2212 X \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X e + e \u2212 X \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X e + e \u2212 X e \u2212 L e + R 0.08% 0.19% 0.04% 0.11% 0.05% 0.09% e \u2212 R e + L 0.06% 0.13% 0.00% 0.12% 0.02% 0.02% very difficult to obtain at the HL-LHC and thus are obtained from the predictions for the ILC [30]. Table X shows for all center-of-mass energies and polarizations in this analysis the relative bias on \u03c3 ZH , which is below 0.1% for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 H channel and 0.2% for the e + e \u2212 X channel. The maximum contribution to the residual bias comes from either the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode or the H \u2192 \u03b3Z mode.",
