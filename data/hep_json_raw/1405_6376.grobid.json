            "text": "The Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule [1] was formulated in the early days of the quark model, stating that all hadronic processes with disconnected quark lines are suppressed. It qualitatively explains phenomena like suppression of \u03c6 meson decays into non-strange particles and suppression of exclusive \u03c6 production in non-strange hadron collisions. Using the known deviation from the ideal mixing angle of the vector mesons \u03c9 and \u03c6, \u03b4 V = 3.7 \u2022 , the production cross section of \u03c6 with respect to that of \u03c9 should be suppressed according to \u03c3 (AB \u2192 X\u03c6)/\u03c3 (AB \u2192 X\u03c9) = tan 2 \u03b4 V = 0.0042, where A, B and X are non-strange hadrons [2]. At low energies, where baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom are most relevant, the ratio can be expressed in terms of meson-meson or meson-nucleon couplings: g 2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03c0 /g 2 \u03c9\u03c1\u03c0 = g 2 \u03c6NN /g 2 \u03c9NN = tan 2 \u03b4 V = 0.0042, where N denotes the nucleon. This is valid provided the coupling ratios g \u03c6\u03c1\u03c0 /g \u03c9\u03c1\u03c0 and g \u03c6NN /g \u03c9NN are equal as advocated in Ref. [3].",

[6]) or as an evasion from the OZI rule because of a hidden strangeness component in the nucleon [7]. Such a strangeness component, possibly polarised, was suggested as an explanation of the sizeable OZI violations observed in pN \u2192 NpV , V = \u03c9, \u03c6 by the SPHINX Collaboration [8].

            "text": "Although being phenomenological in its origin, the OZI rule has been connected to QCD [2]. In a field theoretical approach to the OZI rule, a perturbative treatment based on quark-gluon degrees of freedom requires the scale of a specific process to be much larger than the QCD cut-off parameter \u039b QCD \u2248 200 MeV/c. In charmonium production, where the scale is governed by the charm quark current mass m c \u2248 1275 MeV/c 2 , the quark-antiquark pair is generated by gluon splitting, g \u2192 cc. This is in contrast to the case of strangeness production, where the scale corresponds to the strange quark current mass m s \u2248 95 MeV/c 2 , which is close to \u039b QCD . The validity of the quark-gluon picture can thus be questioned, and the relevant degrees of freedom need to be determined. Gluon splitting can only be used in an effective sense. This has also been discussed in connection to hyperon production in pp \u2192\u039b\u039b production near threshold, where neither meson exchange models nor quark-gluon models give a complete explanation of the experimental data [10]. However, probed at virtualities Q 2 or p 2 \u22a5 1 (GeV/c) 2 , which are large compared to (2m s ) 2 c 2 \u2248 \u039b 2 QCD \u2248 0.04 (GeV/c) 2 , the process can be described in the quark-gluon picture and we expect strangeness suppression to disappear, restoring flavour SU(3) symmetry.",

The difficulty lies in the separation of different reaction mechanisms as a function of transferred energy and angular momentum. The latter is reflected in the anisotropy of the decay angular distributions which can be expressed via the spin density matrix [11]. In the analysis of data from an unpolarised beam impinging on an unpolarised target, symmetries leave one independent element of the spin density matrix, \u03c1 00 , which is a measure for spin alignment (tensor polarisation). It can be extracted from distributions of the angle between the decay plane (3-body decay) or decay axis (2-body decay) of the vector meson and a well-chosen reference axis [12].",

            "text": "For exclusive vector meson production, there are contributions from mainly two classes of processes: resonant and non-resonant production. First, resonant production means diffractive dissociation of the fast proton, where a Pomeron is emitted in the t -channel from the target and excites the beam particle (see Fig. 1, left panel). The target particle receives a small recoil but stays intact. The vector meson is then produced via a baryon resonance. On the other side, there is the non-resonant process including the case when a vector meson is radiated from the proton in the initial or final state. This is possible due to a finite coupling of the vector meson to the meson cloud of the nucleon [21]. These non-resonant processes are summarised in the middle panel of Fig. 1, where the blob in the upper vertex represents point-like and non-point-like interactions. Non-resonant vector meson production also includes central production where a Reggeon or Pomeron from the target and a Reggeon or Pomeron from the beam particle fuse in a central vertex (see Fig. 1, right panel). The production of \u03c9 and \u03c6 in Pomeron-Pomeron collisions does not conserve G-parity and is thus forbidden. Central Production is characterised by large rapidity gaps between all three final state particles. This is equivalent to large gaps between the x F distributions of the outgoing particles. For the pp \u2192 pVp process this results in large x F of the fast proton. Another special case of non-resonant production is the shake-out (see e.g. Ref. [7]) of a qq pair from the sea of one nucleon which becomes on-shell when interacting with a Pomeron from the other nucleon. In the case of shake-out, a rapidity gap is expected between the recoil particle and the other two particles, but not necessarily between the fast proton and the vector meson. Central production and shake-out can in this sense be considered as similar processes in two different regions of phase space. The dynamics of the vector meson is determined by the incoming particles of the production vertex. In the case of Pomeron-Reggeon fusion and shake-out, the dynamics of the vector meson depends on the exchange object(s) while in resonant diffractive production, it depends on the intermediate resonance.",

Energy thresholds of 1 GeV and 2 GeV are applied to ECAL1 and ECAL2, respectively. Furthermore, we require a photon pair in each event with invariant mass within a window around the \u03c0 0 PDG value, which corresponds to \u00b12\u03c3 ECAL , where \u03c3 ECAL is the mass resolution of a photon pair. In the present analysis, the resulting resolution when both photons are detected in ECAL1 (ECAL2) is 10 MeV/c 2 (5 MeV/c 2 ), and 8 MeV/c 2 if one photon is detected in ECAL1 and the other in ECAL2. The momentum of the \u03c0 0 is then recalculated using a fit constrained to the PDG \u03c0 0 mass value to improve the resolution. The \u03c0 + must be identified in the RICH detector. The separation of kaons and pions is done via a log-likelihood method. The likelihood for a pion hypothesis for the measured particle is required to be larger than the likelihood for all other possible particle assignments, where also the distribution of background photons is taken into account [23]. Furthermore, RICH efficiencies are used to correct the particle yields. The sum of energies of the final state particles detected in the spectrometer must be within a window of \u00b15 GeV around the beam energy of 191 GeV, referred to in the following as exclusivity condition. The azimuthal angle of the forward going system (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and the fast proton) and the azimuthal angle of the recoil proton must differ by 180 \u2022 within a window of \u00b116 \u2022 (coplanarity), which corresponds to twice the angular resolution of the RPD.",

The analysis is therefore restricted to 0.6 < x F < 0.9 in both channels in order to compare \u03c6 and \u03c9 production within the same kinematic range.

In each interval, the acceptance-corrected \u03c9 and \u03c6 yields are calculated using the method described in Section 3.3 and corrected for the branching ratios of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays, respectively. The ratio R \u03c6/\u03c9 is calculated in each x F interval.

The violation factor is defined as F OZI = R \u03c6/\u03c9 / tan 2 \u03b4 V , with tan 2 \u03b4 V = 0.0042 being the OZI prediction.

The average value R \u03c6/\u03c9 = 0.0160 \u00b1 0.0003 \u00b1 0.0020 is consistent with the result from SPHINX [8], which is R \u03c6/\u03c9 = 0.0155 \u00b1 0.0005 \u00b1 0.0031. The M p\u03c9 distributions shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the pp \u2192 p\u03c9p cross section may be heavily influenced by the baryon resonances. Unless the resonant contribution is removed from the data set, a measurement of the cross section ratio R \u03c6/\u03c9 does not give sufficient information, neither about the strangeness content of the nucleon nor about other production mechanisms than resonant diffractive production.

Note that if the low-mass resonant region in M p\u03c9 is removed, this results in an OZI violation factor of about 8, independent of x F in the observed range. This agrees well with the results from the SPHINX experiment that operated at a beam energy of 70 GeV [8]. In order to remove the resonant region, SPHINX applied a weaker cut of 1 GeV/c on the p V momentum. This corresponds to mass values of M p\u03c9 of 2.64 GeV/c 2 and M p\u03c6 of 2.8 GeV/c 2 . Applying the same cut on the COMPASS data gives ratios R \u03c6/\u03c9 = 0.032, 0.038 and 0.019 in the three x F bins, which correspond to OZI violation factors F OZI = 7.6, 9 and 4.5 respectively, as summarised in the top part of Table 2 and Fig. 6.

If, conversely, the dominating process is a central Reggeon-Reggeon/Reggeon-Pomeron fusion or in the absence of a resonant system, there is no longer a preferred reference axis and the distributions are expected to be isotropic.

The cos 2 \u03b8 H distributions are shown in Fig. 7 in different x F intervals. The background distribution (open circles) is obtained by sideband subtraction and found to be isotropic. A striking feature of the signal data is that the slope is varying with x F in the case of the \u03c9 meson (see Fig. 7, left), going from a strong negative slope in the interval 0.2 < x F < 0.6 passing through isotropy in the interval 0.7 < x F < 0.8 to a strong positive slope in the interval 0.8 < x F < 0.9. No such behaviour is observed in the case of the \u03c6 meson (see Fig. 7, right), for which the distributions are fairly isotropic in all three x F intervals between 0.6 and 0.9. In the case of the \u03c6 meson, it should however be pointed out that the statistical uncertainty is significantly larger compared to the case of \u03c9 and it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from the \u03c6 decay angular distributions.",

Since both diffractive and central production processes involve the exchange of at least one Reggeon, we define a new reference axis by taking the direction of the momentum transfer from the beam proton in the initial state to the fast proton in the final state, denoted P . In the rest system of the vector meson, this is opposite to the momentum transfer from the target to the recoil. In the case of central production, the dynamics of the vector meson should depend strongly on the exchange, whereas in resonant diffractive production it is instead inherited from the intermediate baryon resonance. The angle \u03b8 EX is calculated in the rest system of the vector meson with the same analyser as before.  The results are shown in Fig. 12. The extracted values of \u03c1 00 are presented in Table 5 and in Fig. 13. The angular distribution of the background (open circles/crosses) is isotropic, which demonstrates that the observed alignment in the signal region is a real physical effect and not an artefact introduced by the experiment. Both \u03c6 and \u03c9 mesons are aligned transverse to the direction of the exchanged Reggeon/Pomeron. The alignment is stronger when x F increases. In production processes without an intermediate state or resonance, the vector meson will \"remember\" the direction of momentum transfer of the incoming Pomeron, which in turn should influence the spin orientation of the vector meson. This is the case in central production and when the vector meson is produced by a shake-out of a qq object in the proton.",

This is in remarkable agreement not only with the SPHINX analysis [8] after removal of the low-M p\u03c9 region, but surprisingly also with data close to threshold from ANKE [33], DISTO [34] and COSY-TOF [35,36]. The high mass part of the M pV spectrum shows no structures, but may still contain N * resonances which probably are broad and largely overlap. The angular distributions are isotropic, which means that either low-spin resonances contribute, which is however unlikely in this mass region, or the contribution of resonances is small. Table 5 Spin alignment \u03c1 00 extracted using P as reference axis. The table includes \u03c6 and \u03c9 production. The results for different p V cuts are also given for \u03c9. The uncertainty is the propagated uncertainty from the linear fits, which in turn includes the quadratic sum of statistical uncertainties and uncertainties from the background subtraction.",

            "text": "In the high-mass continuum, the decays of \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons are both strongly aligned with the direction of the 3-momentum transfer P . The similar behaviour of the alignments together with larger \u03c1 00 values with increasing x F indicates that the production mechanism is the same for \u03c9 and \u03c6 in this region. This may point to a central Pomeron-Reggeon fusion which produces a vector meson. The OZI violation then reflects a hidden flavour-flow with the emitted Reggeon. The observed x F dependence of \u03c1 00 with respect to P , where \u03c1 00 increases with increasing x F , suggests this process since central production favours large x F of the fast proton. A different approach to this reaction is obtained assuming an alignment of the spins of the vector meson with the angular momentum of its emission with respect to P . Then, the transferred angular momentum has to be perpendicular to P . We can regard these events as scattering off a Pomeron radiated from the target proton and absorbed by a colourless object in the beam proton wave function, which carries some fraction of the total momentum. This kind of mechanism may be associated with non-resonant diffractive dissociation. In a very simple picture, the proton disso-ciates into a proton plus a virtual (off-shell) vector meson V * (in Ref. [7], this process is referred to as a shake-out). If the Pomeron emitted from the target recoil proton is absorbed by V * , this could result in an on-shell vector meson recoiling along the direction of momentum transfer of the Pomeron. In other words, we expect that at some energy scale the Pomeron should resolve structures in the extended proton. The data show evidence for this in the observed angular distributions of the vector meson decays, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 and summarised in Table 5. They exhibit large anisotropies increasing with x F , which indicates the presence of a transversely localised process with a dependence of its direction on P . The high OZI violation indicates a higher effective resolution scale in this process and reflects the probability of finding a preformed \u03c6 meson relative to the preformed \u03c9 meson at a resolution scale near m \u03c6 \u2248 1 GeV/c 2 . The natural angular momentum quantisation axis for such a process is the direction of the momentum transfer mediated by the Pomeron. Both \u03c9 and \u03c6 have substantial alignment of their spins perpendicular to this axis, indicating a transferred orbital angular momentum. The latter is naturally oriented perpendicular to the direction of momentum transfer to which the angular momentum of the vector mesons has a tendency to align if spin-orbit forces occur.",

This is in sharp contrast to our data, in which the \u03c9 cross section is thirty times larger than that of the \u03c6.

            "text": "In this work, exclusive \u03c6 and \u03c9 vector meson production in the reaction pp \u2192 pVp has been measured. We find OZI violations ranging from F OZI = 3 to F OZI = 9 depending on the kinematic region. The invariant mass M pV of the forward proton and the vector meson appears to be the most important kinematic quantity in our study to discriminate processes with different mechanisms. The clear structures in the M p\u03c9 spectrum indicate the importance of pp \u2192 pN * , N * \u2192 p\u03c9 in \u03c9 production. This is also supported by the significant alignment of the spin of the \u03c9 meson with respect to the direction of the p\u03c9 system. In the case of decays into a ground state vector meson, the N * has to transfer considerable angular momentum. The absence of structures in the M p\u03c6 spectrum in combination with no observed alignment of the \u03c6 spin with respect to the direction of the p\u03c6 system shows that the decay of the N * resonances into p\u03c6 is OZI suppressed. This indicates that the ss component of such resonances must be very small. The observed OZI violation by a factor 3-4 in this region could be either due to the admixture of other processes or a genuine violation of the predicted g 2 \u03c6NN /g 2 \u03c9NN ratio. Removing the resonance region by requiring M p\u03c9 > 3.3 GeV/c 2 , the OZI violation in the remaining kinematic range is significantly higher, typically of order 8 \u00b1 1. Moreover, the spin of both \u03c9 and \u03c6 are unaligned with respect to the pV system. The behaviour of both vector mesons is the same in the system defined by the transferred momentum. This indicates that the production mechanism in this region for both \u03c9 and \u03c6 is central Reggeon-Pomeron fusion, with the observed OZI violation reflecting a hidden flavour flow. This process can also be regarded as a Pomeron resolving preformed colourless objects in the proton wave function and ejecting them in a shake-out. The direction of the transferred momentum is remembered by the vector meson and is manifested in its decay angular distributions. The OZI violation then reflects the probability of resolving an ss state in the nucleon.",
