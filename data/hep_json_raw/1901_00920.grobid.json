The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) collaboration seeks to discover this particle by looking for the resonant conversion of dark-matter axions to microwave photons in a strong magnetic field. In this paper we report results from an pathfinder experiment, the ADMX \"Sidecar\", which is designed to pave the way for future, higher mass, searches. This testbed experiment lives inside of and operates in tandem with the main ADMX experiment. The Sidecar experiment excludes masses in three widely spaced frequency ranges (4202-4249 MHz, 5086-5799 MHz and 7173-7203 MHz). In addition, Sidecar demonstrates the successful use of a piezoelectric actuator for cavity tuning. Finally, this publication is the first to report data measured using both the TM010 and TM020 modes.",

The stick-slip piezoelectric motors are made by attocube [24] and specified to operate at 10 mK, 31 T, and high vacuum simultaneously. The attocube ANR240/RES rotary and ANPz101eXT12/RES linear motors are mounted to the top end cap of the cavity and are used for tuning rod control and antenna depth adjustment. Figure 2 shows the effect of the rotary piezo actuation of the tuning rod on the Sidecar TM 010 mode as seen in a series of cavity swept response measurements. The cavity frequency is shown to smoothly tune 50 MHz by slowly revolving the rod \u223c2 \u2022 , over the course of several hours. The cavity antenna was made by stripping a section of SMA-terminated, semi-rigid coax. Its coupling to the cavity is measured by directing a swept signal through a circulator towards the antenna. In the case where the antenna is critically coupled to the resonant mode, all power is absorbed into the cavity on resonance. Under normal conditions, the linear piezo motor, with a maximum travel length of 12 mm adjusts the depth of the antenna to maintain a return loss of less than -20 dB relative to the off-resonance reflected baseline.",

During data collection, RF power is occasionally injected into the cavity to simulate an axion signal. Observation of these \"synthetic axions\" confirmed the integrity of the signal path.

A map of the mode structure for a set of tuning rod locations ranging from the center to the wall was created by using an eigenmode solver to find the resonant frequencies over the tuning range of the TM 010 and TM 020 modes. Simulations performed in HFSS [26] are used to identify the relevant mode and calculate its form factor as a function of rod position. Figure 3b shows the form factor of the TM 010 and TM 020 like modes. The axion search data used in this work were collected between August of 2016 and June of 2017 and are composed of three separate data sets labeled in order of increasing frequency and summarized in Table I. Run B is a low magnetic field commissioning run that emphasized testing the piezoelectric tuning capabilities of the experiment, rather than sensitivity. Several months later, a high frequency run (Run C) and a low frequency run (Run A) focused on achieving higher sensitivity over a narrower frequency range. The linear piezo motor responsible for antenna coupling failed early on, causing the loaded Q to be suboptimal and the antenna to remain in an over-coupled state for the duration of the run. The full process by which many raw spectra are combined and converted into limits on the axion-photon coupling (g a\u03b3\u03b3 ) is described in [40]. The procedure begins by taking digitized spectra from the IF band of the receiver, centered at 10.7 MHz, and correcting them for the receiver response. This is done by first dividing each spectrum by the time-independent response, achieved by averaging all of the raw spectra in the data set. Secondly, each spectrum is processed with a Savitsky-Golay filter (length 129 and polynomial order 2) to 95% of the least-deviant power bins to characterize any slowly varying frequency specific receiver structure without fitting out a narrow \u223c5 kHz wide axion signal. Each residual spectrum is then divided by its fit and the baseline of 1 was subtracted to yield unitless spectra with zero mean. Axion-like signals were added to the data to measure the degree of sensitivity degradation caused by the fit. A histogram of all of the residual spectra is well fit by a Gaussian function with \u00b5 = 0.01 and \u03c3 = 0.98, in agreement with the expected probability distribution. The zeromean, unitless spectra are then checked for external interference and finally scaled by the bin resolution, Boltzmann constant, and system temperature T sys to achieve a representation of real power fluctuations in the cavity. The system temperature is calculated by using the Friis   Top: Zoomed-in limits set over the three frequency regions. Regions A and B were scanned using the TM010 mode, while region C was scanned using the TM020 mode.

Due to a failure with one of the cryogenic switches, the noise temperature of the Low Noise Factory amplifier was not measured concurrently with the axion search data. It was measured in situ with a functioning switch in a later run of the sidecar experiment, operating at a physical temperature of 4 K. The system noise contribution from the receiver, including the first-stage amplifier, was calibrated by measuring the change in output rf power as the temperature of the heated load was changed, and found to be 4.0\u00b10.3 K. This was consistent with, but slightly higher than, the manufacturer specification of a 3 K amplifier noise at a physical temperature of 10 K, and so we use our more conservative in situ value. At the end of the single scan correction process, spectra represent thermal noise fluctuations that may contain a very small excess of power from an axion signal. Corrected spectra are then weighted according to their sensitivity, so that data with different system noise, magnetic fields, loaded quality factors, and form factors could be directly summed. Thousands of overlapping and nonoverlapping spectra are added in quadrature to form a single \"grand power spectrum\". For a typical isothermal velocity dispersion v 2 1/2 = 270 km/s, the expected axion signal width is approximately \u2206f \u223c = m a v 2 /h, where h is Planck's constant.

(a) The distribution of the electric fields of the TM010 and TM020-like modes are shown for a tuning angle of 160 \u2022 . (b) Calculated form factor of the TM010 and TM020 modes as a function of mode frequency. Choppy features where the form factor significantly decreases are caused by mode crossings at which the mode of interest tunes into and mixes with an interfering mode.",
