            "text": "Differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter (CP violation) have been observed in several processes and, in particular, in charmless B decays. The current understanding of the composition of matter in the Universe indicates that other mechanisms, beyond those proposed within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, should exist in order to account for the observed imbalance in the matter and antimatter abundances. The study of CP -violating processes may therefore be used to test the corresponding SM predictions and place constraints on extensions of this framework. In this work, a set of CP -violating observables is measured using B 0 meson decays reconstructed in the (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) quasitwo-body final state. 1 Particular emphasis is placed on the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 K * (892) 0 decay (hereafter, denoted by B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 ). Direct CP violation manifests through the difference between partial widths of a decay and its CP conjugate. The first decay in which direct CP violation was observed in B mesons was B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 [1,2]. The measured CP asymmetry of this channel is known to be A CP = \u22120.082 \u00b1 0.006 [3]. Decays of the B 0 meson to \u03c0K final states and to their vector counterparts, \u03c1K * , proceed via a remarkably rich set of contributing amplitudes. For the neutral modes B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 K 0 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 , the tree level contribution, b \u2192 uus (depending on the CKM matrix elements V ub V * us ), is doubly Cabibbo suppressed and higher order diagrams dominate the decay (see figure 1). Such contributions originate from the b \u2192 dds (V tb V * ts ) process that may proceed either via colour-allowed electroweakpenguin or gluonic-penguin transitions. When accounting for the helicity amplitudes of the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 vector-vector (V V ) decay, the electroweak-penguin amplitude contributes with different signs depending on the considered helicity eigenstate. This allows for several interference patterns in the decay and plays an important role in its polarisation since both penguin amplitudes are comparable in magnitude. A detailed discussion on these phenomena can be found in ref. [4]. Other theoretical works [5] predict enhanced direct CP -violating effects in the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 decay due to the interference with the B 0 \u2192 \u03c9K * 0 decay and due to isospin-breaking consequences of this interference. The angular analysis of V V decays also gives access to T-odd triple product asymmetries (TPA), which are observables suitable for comparison with theoretical predictions, such as those in ref. [6].",

            "text": "In the past, the theoretical approach to the study of B decays into light-vector mesons was influenced by the idea that quark helicity conservation and the V\u2212A nature of the weak interaction induce large longitudinal polarisation fractions, of order f 0 \u223c 0.9. However, this prediction holds only for decays dominated by tree diagrams [7,8], whilst in penguindominated decays this hypothesis is not fulfilled [9][10][11]. 2 Low values of longitudinal polarisation fractions in penguin-dominated decays could be accounted by the SM invoking a strong-interaction effect, both in the QCD factorisation (QCDF) [4] and perturbative (pQCD) [13] frameworks. This so-called polarisation puzzle might be resolved by combining measurements from all the B \u2192 \u03c1K * modes (B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * 0 , B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2212 K * + , B + \u2192 \u03c1 0 K * + and B + \u2192 \u03c1 + K * 0 ). This would allow also to probe physics beyond the SM [14,15].",

Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter.

Here the impact parameter significance is defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of a given PV when it is reconstructed with and without the track candidate. In addition, each vector resonance candidate is required to have transverse momentum larger than 900 MeV/c and total momentum larger than 1 GeV/c. The B 0 candidates are formed by combining the aforementioned four tracks, which must form a good quality vertex. These candidates are required to have flight direction aligned with their momentum vector and a small significance, \u03c7 2 IP < 20, of the impact parameter with respect to their production PV. The final-state particle with the largest neural network PID kaon hypothesis is assigned to be the kaon candidate, while the remaining three particles are required to be consistent with the pion hypothesis.

This parallelisation reduces the computing time by a factor \u223c 50 when using Minuit [46] to minimise the likelihood function. The Ipanema framework is implemented using pyCUDA [47] and serves as interface to minimisation algorithms other than Minuit. In particular, it allows to use the MultiNest algorithm [48][49][50], which employs a multimodal nested sampling strategy to calculate the most likely values of the fitted parameters. Not relying on partial derivatives of the minimised function, the MultiNest method is very effective in finding minima of the likelihood function in weighted data samples, like in this work, and is thus preferred to Minuit to obtain the central values of the result. Despite its robustness, MultiNest is much slower than Minuit and therefore the latter was used to evaluate some systematic uncertainties using pseudoexperiments, as explained in section 7.",

The significance of the CP asymmetry is obtained by dividing the value of the asymmetry by the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic uncertainties and is found to be in excess of 5 standard deviations.
