This analysis is made consistent also with \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 data, reported separately. The analysis requires s-channel resonances with a spectrum close to that published earlier for C = +1 states with I = 0; masses for I = 1 states are lower on average by 20 MeV. Two alternative solutions are found, differing only for J P = 2 + and 4 + states by small amounts in masses and widths. Both 3\u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03c0 0 data prefer one of these two solutions. For this preferred solution, observed states have J P C , masses and widths (M , \u0393) in MeV as follows: 4",

Blatt-Weisskopf centrifugal barrier factors B are included explicitly for coupling topp (momentum p in the overall centre of mass frame) and coupling to the decay channel (momentum q); the radius of the centrifugal barrier is set to 0.83 fm from Ref.

Partial waves with J P = 2 + and 4 + may couple to \u2113 = J \u00b1 1 in thepp channel, e.g. 3 F 2 and 3 P 2 . Multiple scattering through the resonance is expected to lead to approximately the same phase \u03c6 for both \u2113 values.

For present data, they are less accurately determined (because of the lack of polarisation data) but are consistent with zero.

The fundamental reason is that no data are available from a polarised target, as was the case for I = 0 in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + channel. Polarisation data play two fundamental roles. Firstly, they separate amplitudes with helicities 0 and 1 in the initial state, hence \u2113 = J \u00b1 1. In the present analysis, separation between 3 P 2 and 3 F 2 amplitudes and between 3 F 4 and 3 H 4 is hampered by the absence of such polarisation information. The second role of polarisation data is that they are phase sensitive. Polarisation measures the imaginary part of interferences between partial waves, while differential cross sections are sensitive to the real parts of interferences. For I = 0, C = +1, the availability of both differential cross sections and polarisations puts tight constraints on all phases. For the present I = 1, C = +1 channels, relative phases are poorly determined when the phase angle between partial waves is close to 0 or \u03c0, because of the lack of polarisation data. This leads to larger errors for several resonances.",

            "text": "A second problem is as follows. Dalitz plots for 3\u03c0 0 data are shown at four representative momenta in Fig. 1. There is just one dominant signal, f 2 (1270)\u03c0, from which to search for resonances. Underneath the f 2 (1270) bands is a broad physics background. This is fitted as \u03c3\u03c0, where \u03c3 stands for the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave amplitude as parametrised in Ref. [6]. Because of the sixfold symmetry of the Dalitz plot, it is hard to separate contributions from low and high masses in \u03c0\u03c0. The \u03c3 amplitude varies slowly with s and its coupling constant is likely to have some s-dependence. We assume the coupling constant may vary linearly with s. There must also be contributions from so-called triangle diagrams [7]. One of the pions from the decay of f 2 (1270) may rescatter from the spectator pion, producing a new resonance. In principle such processes are calculable. They lead to a logarithmic variation of the amplitude with s. Such processes cannot in practice be separated from the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave amplitude. In summary, there is an intrinsic uncertainty about how to parametrise the background. Different parametrisations lead to somewhat different interferences with f 2 (1270) bands. Since the broad background appears dominantly in the J P = 0 \u2212 channel, these differences introduce uncertainties mostly into the determination of singlet partial waves with J P = 0 \u2212 , 2 \u2212 and 4 \u2212 . The fit to angular distributions in Fig. 2 at 1200 and 1350 MeV/c is not perfect. The problem is associated with the crossing of three f 2 (1270) bands, visible on Fig. 1. A possible explanation is that triangle effects of Ref. [7] will have maximum effect at this triple intersection.",

They also used different values of the ratios r 2 between 3 F 2 and 3 P 2 amplitudes and likewise for r 4 between 3 H 4 and 3 F 4 . These defects are rectified here. It turns out to be quite difficult to find a combined fit This change is particularly large for 3\u03c0 0 data at the lowest two momenta. The fit shown in Ref. [1] had a large 3 P 1 intensity there. However, we now find that adding further 3 P 2 states at \u223c 1950 and 2175 MeV produces a very large improvement in the fit, by \u223c 10500 in log likelihood. There is large cross-talk at low momenta between 3 P 2 and 3 P 1 and, to a lesser extent, with 3 F 3 ; these partial waves all produce f 2 (1270)\u03c0 amplitudes with L = 1 and 3 in the final state and differ only by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for different helicities. In the new fit, the 3 P 1 amplitudes shrink to quite small values, and 3 P 2 and 3 F 3 amplitudes grow to large values.

Removing any small amplitude for f 0 (980), f 0 (1300), f 0 (1500), etc. introduces changes in log likelihood up to 250. Table 1 shows masses and widths of resonances in the preferred solution 2. These results supercede those of Refs. [1] and [2]. Statistical errors are very small, typically 5 MeV for masses. Errors in the Tables cover systematic variations in a large number of alternative fits (e.g. omitting f 0 (980)\u03c0, f 0 (1500)\u03c0 or f 2 (1565)\u03c0 final states). The parameters of the 6 + state are set to those of a 6 (2450) of the Particle Data Group, but there is little sensitivity to this choice. For solution 1, masses and widths of all states except 2 + and 4 + show changes from solution 2 no larger than statistical errors, i.e. \u223c 5 MeV.  Generally it should be regarded with suspicion. There are two physics reasons for preferring solution 2. The first is that the upper 2 + and 4 + states are closer to those observed for I = 0, C = +1, shown in the final column of Table  1 for comparison. Although one state might shift significantly in mass, for example because of the opening of a nearby threshold, systematic differences of 60-105 MeV between I = 0 and I = 1 states seems unlikely. The second indication is that the fit to I = 0, C = +1 found a large positive value of r 4 for the upper resonance of 2.7 \u00b1 0.5, closer to the present solution 1. Values of r 2 are similar for I = 0 and 1.",

This does not solve the problem: log likelihood increases by 820, but when masses are released, they drift down again to the solution of Table 1.

In that previous analysis, a lower 1 + state was reported at 2100 MeV. That claim is now withdrawn. The addition of the strong a 2 (1950) state has improved the fit by a very large amount and has reduced the 3 P 1 amplitudes to small values peaking near threshold. Some low mass 1 + contribution is still required, but it optimises at 1930 MeV, below the available mass range, which begins at 1960 MeV. It cannot be regarded as well defined from present data.",

However, the \u03c0 2 (2245) has large errors; also a 2 (1950) and a 1 (1930) are not securely identified in mass and width, though some such contributions are definitely required. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of M 2 against radial excitation number with straight line trajectories with a slope of 1.143 GeV \u22122 . This is the average slope fitted to I = 0 states in Ref. [4]. The pion is not shown on the 1 S 0 trajectory, because its mass is pulled strongly downwards by the instanton interaction. That may affect \u03c0(1300) by an unknown amount. Around 1800 MeV, the VES group reports both \u03c0(1800) and a 0 \u2212 peak in \u03c1\u03c9 at 1750 MeV [12]. If they are distinct, the former is a strong hybrid candidate. Fig. 7 shows the mean mass with an error covering both possibilities. Two possible slopes 1.143 GeV \u22122 and 1.38 GeV \u22122 were discussed in Ref. [13] and trajectories of T-matrix and K-matrix poles were considered. The K-matrix poles are not discussed here, but T-matrix pole trajectories may be investigated fully. The best solution corresponds much better to the first slope. To make an explicit check, we make a set of fits restricting resonance masses to straight-line trajectories.",

As discussed above, when two 0 + resonances are introduced in the mass range 1900-2410 MeV, the 0 ++ sector becomes weakly defined and such readjustment causes only very marginal loss in log likelihood. The 3 P 2 trajectory starts from a 2 (1320) with a 2 (1680) as the radial excitation. For a slope of 1.143 GeV \u22122 , this requires the mass of the next state to be 1980-1990 MeV, one standard deviation above a 2 (1950). The next state is predicted at \u223c 2250 MeV. Although the mass shift required for a 2 (2175) is two standard deviations, we stress that this resonance gives the smallest contribution to the likelihood value. The resulting fit with slope 1.143 GeV 2 for all resonances gives log likelihood only 350 worse than the best fit. There are no visible discrepancies in fits to data and this solution may be considered acceptable under the restrictions imposed. The fit with slope 1.38 GeV \u22122 produces a solution with log likelihood worse by 2200 than the best solution. We conclude that resonance masses for the I = 1 C = +1 sector correspond approximately to the slope of 1.143 GeV 2 , but not to the slope 1.38 Gev \u22122 for T-matrix poles.",
