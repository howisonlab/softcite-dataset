The events selected contain an imbalance in the total transverse momentum, jets identified as containing b quarks, and no identified leptons. The sum of the s-and t-channel single top quark cross sections is measured to be 3.53 obtained at the 95% credibility level. These measurements are combined with previously reported CDF results obtained from events with an imbalance in total transverse momentum, jets identified as originating from b quarks, and one identified lepton. The combined cross section is measured to be 3.02 \u00fe0.49 \u22120.48 pb and a lower limit on jV tb j of 0.84 is obtained at the 95% credibility level. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.93.032011",

Since the production amplitude is proportional to the Wtb coupling, the measurement of the single top quark production cross section offers a way to determine directly the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [2] matrix element V tb . This is the only way to measure V tb without assuming the unitarity of the CKM matrix. Checking the unitarity of the CKM matrix is among the most powerful approaches to test for the presence of broad classes of particles or interactions not described by the standard model (SM). These couplings have been the subject of intense experimental activity in the past three decades.",

The top quark subsequently decays to a W \u00fe boson and a b quark, and fragmentation and hadronization of the b andb quarks result in two jets that can be reconstructed in the detector. For the t-channel process, jets tend to be more boosted along the proton-antiproton beam axis than those originating from the s-channel process. Thus, some of the t-channel jets especially are emitted in regions that are not instrumented and therefore escape the detector acceptance. Examples of SM single top quark production processes dominating at the Tevatron are shown in Fig. 1.",

A multivariate algorithm is used to parametrize the trigger efficiency as a function of several kinematic and angular variables of the event [13]. In the offline analysis, events are accepted if the reconstructed missing transverse energy, after corrections to jet energies to account for detector defects and jet size fluctuations in the calorimeters, is at least 35 GeV. Measured jet energies are corrected to account for nonuniformities in calorimeter response, energy lost outside the jet cone, and underlying event dynamics [14]. The jet energy scale and resolution, as well as the E T resolution, are further improved by incorporating corrections based on charged-particle momentum measurements [15].",

The observed single top quark production cross section is \u03c3 s\u00fet \u00bc 3.53 \u00fe1.25 \u22121.16 pb, obtained by constraining the s-=t-channel ratio to the SM prediction. This measurement is consistent with the SM predicted cross section of 3.15 AE 0.36 pb [4]. The magnitude of V tb is extracted from the single top quark cross section posterior probability density by the relation jV tb j 2 obs \u00bc jV tb j 2 SM \u03c3 s\u00fet obs =\u03c3 s\u00fet SM , where variables with the subscript \"SM\" (\"obs\") correspond to the theoretical predictions (observed values) [31]. We assume jV tb j 2 SM \u00bc 1 and fix the s-=t-channel ratio to the SM prediction. Including the theoretical uncertainty of the signal cross section (5.8% for s-channel, 6.2% for t-channel) [4] and assuming a uniform prior in the interval 0 < jV tb j 2 < 1, a lower bound on jV tb j of 0.63 is obtained at the 95% credibility level (C.L.). Figure 3(a) shows the two-dimensional posterior probability density for the s-and t-channel cross sections, where both channels' contributions are allowed to vary independently and a uniform prior in the plane is assumed. The point that maximizes the posterior probability density is (\u03c3 s \u00bc 1.73 pb, \u03c3 t \u00bc 0.92 pb) and the smallest regions containing 68% and 95% of the integral of the density are indicated. To measure the t-channel cross section, we constrain the s-channel contribution to its SM prediction of 1.05 AE 0.06 pb within its uncertainty, in analogy to the procedure used in Ref. [9] to extract the s-channel single top quark production cross section. We measure the t-channel cross section to be \u03c3 t \u00bc 1.19 \u00fe0.93 \u22120.97 pb, consistent with the SM prediction of 2.10 AE 0.12 pb [4]. The s-channel cross section was measured in an analysis optimized for the purpose [9], yielding \u03c3 s \u00bc 1.12 \u00fe0.61 \u22120.57 pb. These results are combined with those of the most recent CDF measurement of single top quark production in the l\u03bdbb sample [10], which measured the cross section including the tW-channel among the signal processes, yielding \u03c3 s\u00fet\u00fetW \u00bc 3.04 \u00fe0.57 \u22120.53 pb, assuming a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV=c 2 . The combination is achieved by collecting the inputs from the E T bb and the l\u03bdbb analyses and taking the product of the likelihoods of both analyses and simultaneously varying the correlated uncertainties, following the procedure explained above. In the l\u03bdbb analysis, candidate events were selected by requiring TABLE I. Numbers of signal and background events in the twojet signal region in the subsamples with exactly one tightly tagged jet (1 T), one tightly and one loosely tagged jet (TL), and two tightly tagged jets (TT). The signal and background event rates and the associated total uncertainties are the results of a fit of the predictions to the data. The backgrounds are constrained within their theoretical cross section uncertainties and uncertainties from auxiliary measurements, and the signals are left unconstrained. Signal yields for s-channel events are computed using the cross section measured constraining the t-channel contribution to the SM and the yields for t-channel events are from the cross section measurement performed by constraining the s-channel contribution to the SM. exactly one reconstructed charged lepton (e or \u03bc) in the final state. Hence, no such events are included in the E T bb analysis described above. The tW contribution is neglected. This process is kinematically similar to tt production and its inclusion or omission from the fit does not affect the measurement of either the s-channel or the t-channel component. The uncertainties associated with the theoretical cross sections of the tt, VV, and VH production processes, and those associated with the luminosity are taken as fully correlated between the two analyses. The combined measurement results in a single top quark production cross section \u03c3 s\u00fet \u00bc 3.02 \u00fe0.49 \u22120.48 pb, consistent with the SM prediction. From the posterior probability density on jV tb j 2 , a 95% C.L. lower limit of jV tb j > 0.84 is obtained. The two-dimensional posterior probability is shown in Fig. 3(b), where the s-and t-channel contributions are allowed to vary freely. The point that maximizes the posterior probability density is (\u03c3 s \u00bc 1.94 pb, \u03c3 t \u00bc 1.44 pb). The t-channel cross section, measured in the same way as for the E T bb analysis, is \u03c3 t \u00bc 1.65 \u00fe0.38 \u22120.36 pb, in agreement with the SM prediction given above. An s-channel cross section of \u03c3 s \u00bc 1.36 \u00fe0.37 \u22120.32 pb was measured by combining the l\u03bdbb and E T bb s-channel-optimized analyses as reported in Ref. [9].",

            "text": "In summary, an updated measurement of the single top quark production cross section \u03c3 s\u00fet \u00bc 3.53 \u00fe1.25 \u22121.16 pb is obtained in events with missing transverse energy and jets using the full CDF data set. This represents a relative improvement of 40% in overall precision with respect to the previous CDF E T bb analysis [8]. The cross section for the t-channel-only single top quark production process as well as a 95% C.L. lower limit on jV tb j are also obtained. In addition, a combination with the l\u03bdbb CDF result [10] is performed to obtain a s \u00fe t cross section measurement of 3.02 \u00fe0.49 \u22120.48 pb, together with a t-channel-only cross section measurement of 1.65 \u00fe0.38 \u22120.36 pb, which are the final and most precise measurements of these quantities from CDF. The jV tb j > 0.84 95% C.L. lower limit obtained from the combination is the most stringent limit on jV tb j from CDF. Once combined with similar results obtained by the D0 Collaboration, these results are expected to significantly improve the constraints on the parameter space of a broad class of SM extensions.",
