As the number of events observed in data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, is in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, model-independent limits are set on the fiducial cross section for the production of events in this final state. Exclusion limits are also placed in models where dark-matter candidates are pair-produced. For darkmatter production via an axial-vector or a vector mediator in the s-channel, this search excludes mediator masses below 750-1200 GeV for dark-matter candidate masses below 230-480 GeV at 95% confidence level, depending on the couplings. In an effective theory of dark-matter production, the limits restrict the value of the suppression scale M * to be above 790 GeV at 95% confidence level. A limit is also reported on the production of a high-mass scalar resonance by processes beyond the Standard Model, in which the resonance decays to Z \u03b3 and the Z boson subsequently decays into neutrinos.",

The search for energetic \u03b3 + E miss T events, whose rates have a low expected contribution from Standard Model (SM) processes, can thus provide sensitivity to new physics models [1][2][3][4][5], also related to dark matter (DM). Although the existence of DM is well established [6], its nature is yet unknown. One candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP, also denoted by \u03c7 ) that interacts with SM particles with a strength similar to the weak interaction. If WIMPs interact with quarks via a mediator particle, pairs of WIMPs are produced in pp collisions at sufficiently high energy. The \u03c7\u03c7 pair is invisible to the detector, but the radiation of an initial-state photon in qq \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 interactions [7] can produce detectable \u03b3 + E miss T events.",

This paper focuses on simplified models assuming Dirac-fermion DM candidates produced via an schannel mediator with vector or axial-vector interactions [8][9][10]. There are five free parameters in this model: the WIMP mass m \u03c7 , the mediator mass m med , the width of the mediator med , the coupling g q of the mediator to quarks, and the coupling g \u03c7 of the mediator to the dark-matter particle.

The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid which provides a 2 T magnetic field. A high-granularity lead/liquid-argon sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (EM) covers the region |\u03b7| < 3.2. It is segmented longitudinally in shower depth. The first layer has a high granularity in the \u03b7 direction in order to provide an efficient discrimination between single-photon showers and two overlapping photons originating from a \u03c0 0 decay. The second layer is where most of the energy, deposited in the calorimeter by electron-or photon-initiated electromagnetic showers, is collected. Significant energy deposits can be left in the third layer by very high energy showers; this layer can also be used to correct for energy leakage beyond the electromagnetic calorimeter. A steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter covers the range |\u03b7| < 1.7, while the liquid-argon technology with either copper or tungsten as the absorber material is used for the hadronic calorimeters in the end-cap region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2 and for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements in the forward region up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. A muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters. It consists of three large air-core superconducting toroidal magnet systems, precision tracking chambers providing accurate muon tracking out to |\u03b7| = 2.7, and fast detectors for triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system is used to select events for offline analysis [28].",

            "text": "Photons are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter measured in projective towers. Clusters without matching tracks are classified as unconverted photon candidates. A photon candidate containing clusters that can be matched to tracks is considered as a converted photon candidate [50]. The photon energy is corrected by applying the energy scales measured with Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays [51]. The trajectory of the photon is reconstructed using the longitudinal (shower depth) segmentation of the calorimeters and a constraint from the average collision point of the proton beams. For converted photons, the position of the conversion vertex is also used if tracks from the conversion have hits in the silicon detectors. Identification requirements are applied in order to reduce the contamination from \u03c0 0 or other neutral hadrons decaying to two photons. The photon identification is based on the profile of the energy deposits in the first and second layers of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Candidate photons are required to have E \u03b3 T > 10 GeV, to satisfy the \"loose\" identification criteria defined in Ref. [52] and to be within |\u03b7| < 2.37. Photons used in the event selection must additionally satisfy the \"tight\" identification criteria [52], have |\u03b7| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.37 and be isolated by requiring the energy in the calorimeters in a cone of size R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the cluster barycentre, excluding the energy associated with the photon cluster, to be less than 2.45 GeV + 0.022 \u00d7 E \u03b3 T . This cone energy is corrected for the leakage of the photon energy from the central core and for the effects of pile-up [51]. In addition, the scalar sum of the p T of non-conversion tracks in a cone of size R = 0.2 around the cluster barycentre is required to be less than 0.05 \u00d7 E \u03b3 T . Electrons are reconstructed from clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter which are matched to a track in the ID. The criteria for their identification, and the calibration steps, are similar to those used for photons. Electron candidates must fulfil the \"medium\" identification requirement of Ref. [51]. Muons are identified either as a combined track in the MS and ID systems, or as an ID track that, once extrapolated to the MS, is associated with at least one track segment in the MS. Extrapolated muons are also considered; they are reconstructed from an MS track which is required to be compatible with originating from the nominal interaction point. Muon candidates must pass the \"medium\" identification requirement [53]. The significance of the transverse impact parameter, defined as the transverse impact parameter d 0 divided by its estimated uncertainty, \u03c3 d 0 , of tracks with respect to the beam line is required to satisfy |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 < 5.0 for electrons and |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 < 3.0 for muons. The longitudinal impact parameter z 0 must satisfy |z 0 sin \u03b8 | < 0.5 mm for both the electrons and muons. Electrons are required to have p T > 7 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47, while muons are required to have p T > 6 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.7.",

As the \u03b3 +jets background contribution is not significant in these leptonic CRs, the requirement on the ratio E miss T / \u221a E T is not applied. In the one-muon control region (1muCR) the W \u03b3 contribution is enhanced by requiring the presence of a muon; the 1muCR is sufficient to constrain the W \u03b3 normalisation effectively without the need of a similar one-electron control region, which would be contaminated by \u03b3 +jets background. The two-lepton control regions enhance the Z \u03b3 background by requiring the presence of a pair of muons (2muCR) or electrons (2eleCR). In each case, the CR lepton selection follows the same requirements as the SR lepton veto, with the addition that the leptons must be isolated with \"loose\" criteria [53] based on information from the calorimeter and tracking systems. In both 1muCR and 2muCR, the E miss T value is computed disregarding muons, effectively treating them as non-interacting particles, in order to ensure that the E miss T distributions in those CRs are similar to that in the SR. The same procedure is followed for electrons in 2eleCR. In both the Z \u03b3enriched control regions, the dilepton invariant mass m is required to be greater than 20 GeV, and the invariant mass of the leptons and photon, m \u03b3 , is required to be smaller than 1 TeV in order to avoid probing for potential BSM high-mass Z \u03b3 resonances. The normalisation of the dominant Z (\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)\u03b3 background source is largely constrained by the event yields in 2muCR and 2eleCR. The systematic uncertainty due to the extrapolation of the correction factors from CRs to SRs is taken into account (see Sect. 8).",

This background, which increased in 2016 data with respect to 2015 data because of the higher pile-up conditions, is suppressed by the large E miss T and jet-E miss T azimuthal separation requirements and by the requirement E miss T / \u221a E T > 8.5 GeV 1/2 described in Sect. 5. This last requirement reduces the contribution of \u03b3 +jets events in SRI1 to less than 10% of the total background, with a negligible effect on the acceptance for signal events. The fraction of \u03b3 +jets events decreases with E miss T and becomes less than 2% of the total background in SRI3. For the estimation of the residual \u03b3 +jets background, a specific control region (PhJetCR) enriched in \u03b3 +jets events is defined. It uses the same criteria as used for the SRs, but does not apply the requirement on the ratio E miss T / \u221a E T , and requires 85 GeV < E miss T < 110 GeV and azimuthal separation between the photon and E miss T , \u03c6(\u03b3 , E miss T ), to be smaller than 3.0. The latter selection minimises the contamination from signal events, which is estimated to be at most at the level of 1%. The PhJetCR is the same for all SRs; the systematic uncertainty due to the modelling of the \u03b3 +jets background, which affects its extrapolation from the low-E miss T PhJetCR to the SRs with larger E miss T , is taken into account (see Sect. 8).",

To establish a pure sample of electrons, the ee and the e\u03b3 invariant masses (m ee and m e\u03b3 ) are both required to be consistent with the Z boson mass to within 10 GeV, and the E miss T is required to be smaller than 40 GeV. Furthermore, the sidebands to the Z boson mass window are used to estimate and subtract possible contamination from misidentified jets in this sample. The misidentification factor, calculated as the ratio of the number of \u03b3 + e to the number of e + e \u2212 events, is parameterised as a function of p T and pseudorapidity and it varies between 0.59 and 2.5%. Systematic uncertainties in the misidentification factors are evaluated by varying the sideband definition, comparing the results of the method (with or without using the sideband subtraction) with generator-level information about Z (\u2192 ee) MC events, and comparing the misidentification factors in Z (\u2192 ee) and W (\u2192 e\u03bd) MC events.

The likelihood fit includes both the SRs and their CRs.",

Figure 4 (top left) shows the observed and expected contours corresponding to a 95% CL exclusion as a function of m med and m \u03c7 for the simplified model A1. The region of the plane under the limit curves is excluded. The region not allowed due to perturbative unitarity violation is to the left of the line defined by m \u03c7 = \u221a \u03c0/2m med [75]. The line corresponding to the DM thermal relic abundance measured by the Planck collaboration [76] is also indicated in the figure; it is obtained as detailed in Ref. [74]. Figure 4 (top right) shows the contours for the A2 model, while Fig. 4 (bottom left) and (bottom right) show the contours for the V1 and V2 models, respectively. The search excludes mediator masses below the values reported in Table 8 for \u03c7 masses below the values reported in the same table. The limits for the model A1 are more stringent than the limits obtained with the 2015 data only [17], which excluded mediator masses below 710 GeV for \u03c7 masses below 150 GeV. Figure 5 (left) shows the contours corresponding to a 90% CL exclusion translated into the plane of \u03c7 -proton spindependent (SD) scattering cross sections vs. m \u03c7 for the    Fig. 4 The observed and expected 95% CL exclusion contours for a simplified model of dark-matter production involving an axial-vector operator, Dirac DM and couplings g q = 0.25, g \u03c7 = 1 and g = 0 as a function of the dark-matter mass m \u03c7 and the mediator mass m med (upper left). The plane under the limit curve is excluded. The same is shown for an axial-vector operator with couplings g q = 0.1, g \u03c7 = 1 and g = 0.1 (top right), for a vector operator with couplings g q = 0.25, g \u03c7 = 1 and g = 0 (bottom left) and for a vector operator with couplings g q = 0.1, g \u03c7 = 1 and g = 0.01 (bottom right). The region on the left is excluded by the perturbative limit which is relevant for axialvector mediators [77]. The relic density curve [74,76] is also shown: at higher mediator masses, the DM would be overabundant; at lower values, it would be underabundant; for the axial-vector scenario shown in the upper right figure, the region above the relic density curve at high dark-matter masses is also overabundant axial-vector mediator model A1. Bounds on the \u03c7 -proton cross section are obtained following the procedure described in Ref. [77], assuming that the axial-vector mediator with couplings as in A1 is solely responsible for both collider \u03c7 pair production and for \u03c7 -proton scattering. In this plane, a comparison with the result from direct DM searches [78,79] is possible. The limit placed in this search extends to arbitrarily low values of m \u03c7 , as the acceptance at lower mass values is the same as the one at the lowest m \u03c7 value shown here. The search provides stringent limits on the scattering cross section of the order of 10 \u221242 cm 2 up to m \u03c7 masses of about 300 GeV. These results allow complementary limits to be set on the \u03c7 -proton scattering cross section in the low DM mass region where the direct DM search experiments have less sensitivity due to the very low energy recoils that such low-mass dark-matter particles would induce. Figure 5 (right) shows the limit contours in the plane of the \u03c7 -nucleon spin-independent (SI) scattering cross section vs. m \u03c7 for the vector mediator model V1 compared with results of direct DM searches [80][81][82][83]. In this case the limit on the scattering cross section is of the order of 10 \u221241 cm 2 up to m \u03c7 masses of about 500 GeV.",

The effect of the truncation for two representative values of the EFT coupling, g * , is shown in the same figure, assuming that the scale at which  Fig. 5 The 90% CL exclusion limit on the \u03c7-proton scattering cross section in a simplified model of dark-matter production involving an axial-vector operator, Dirac DM and couplings g q = 0.25, g \u03c7 = 1 and g = 0 as a function of the dark-matter mass m \u03c7 .

The limits from the search in the Z \u2192 qq channel with 3.2 fb \u22121 [84] are also reported the three exclusive signal regions by using the multiple-bin fit. The heavy resonances are expected to populate mainly the E miss T > 300 GeV signal region as they would have a hard E miss T spectrum. The upper bound on m \u03b3 applied in 2eleCR and 2muCR (see Sect. 6.1) suppresses the contamination from potential high-mass Z \u03b3 resonances in these control regions. Limits on such a resonance were also placed by bump searches in the very sensitive dileptonic channel and the hadronic channel for masses below and above 1.5 TeV, respectively [84]. Although the Z boson branching ratio to neutrinos is higher than to charged leptons, the presence of E miss T makes the search in this channel much less sensitive than in the dileptonic channel; the region of interest for the analysis discussed here lies at higher masses, where it can complement the searches using Z boson hadronic decays whose limits, obtained with 3.2 fb \u22121 , are reported in the same figure. The observed (expected) limits at 95% CL on the production of a Z \u03b3 resonance are 26 and 43 fb (32 and 58 fb) for masses of 2 and 5 TeV, respectively.",

            "text": "Results are reported from a search for dark matter in events with a high transverse energy photon and large missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC. Data collected by the ATLAS experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 are used. The observed data are consistent with the Standard Model expectations. The observed (expected) upper limits on the fiducial cross section for the production of events with a photon and large missing transverse momentum are 7.0 and 2.3 fb (10.6 and 3.0 fb) at 95% CL for E miss T thresholds of 150 and 300 GeV, respectively. For the simplified dark-matter model considered, the search excludes axial-vector and vector mediators with masses below 750-1200 GeV for \u03c7 masses below 230-480 GeV at 95% CL, depending on the couplings chosen. For an EFT \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03c7\u03c7 model of dark-matter production, values of the suppression scale M * up to 790 GeV are excluded at 95% CL and the effect of truncation for various coupling values is reported. The observed (expected) limits at 95% CL on the production cross section for a narrow Z \u03b3 scalar resonance are 26 and 43 fb (32 and 58 fb) for masses of 2 and 5 TeV, respectively. ",
