This is the case of quantum interferometry studies with antimatter, where micrometric fringes have to be measured. In this framework, we designed and realized a new emulsion based detector characterized by a gel enriched in terms of silver bromide crystal contents poured on a glass plate. We tested the sensitivity of such a detector to low energy positrons in the range 10-20 keV. The obtained results prove that nuclear emulsions are highly efficient at detecting positrons at these energies. This achievement paves the way to perform matter-wave interferometry with positrons using this technology.",

            "text": "The use of nuclear emulsions as tracking detector in particle physics dates back to more than a century ago. From the nineties onwards, a renewed interest was triggered by neutrino physics, thanks to parallel technological advances in the field of emulsion production and automatic scanning [1]. More recently, their exploitation in additional fields of research has begun. Among those, an emulsion based detector is particularly a promising option to measure the free fall of antihydrogen atoms in the Earth's gravitational field at CERN [2]. Its capability to reconstruct antiproton annihilations with micrometric resolution has also been demonstrated [3]. Furthermore, a proof of the detection principle (the observation of the shadow pattern produced by antiprotons propagating through a moir\u00e9 deflectometer coupled to an emulsion detector) was successfully conducted [4].",

It features an enriched content of silver bromide crystals (\u223c55% in volume) and low background 1 , defined in terms of the number of thermal induced grains, that is \u223c1-2 grains/1000 \u00b5m 3 . Emulsion detectors are then produced by pouring the gel on a glass plate at the Laboratory of High Energy Physics of the University of Bern. The glass support is needed for its small thermal expansion coefficient, about one order of magnitude lower than the usual emulsion plastic supports. In fact, this is a relevant point in view of the detection of micrometric fringes over surfaces of several mm 2 . Besides the local sub-micrometric precision provided by the emulsion detectors, it is crucial to keep an overall stability at the micrometric level after the chemical development of the emulsions, which could introduce significant deformations in the reconstructed pattern. A 1.0\u00b10.1 \u00b5m gelatine layer on the emulsion surface protects the sensitive layer against minor damages. It also prevents background enhancement during handling and transportation operations. Furthermore, glycerine is added to the gel at a concentration of 1.5% to allow operation in vacuum, as described in [2]. The densities of the emulsion layer and the protective layer were 4.0 \u00b1 0.3 g/cm 3 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 g/cm 3 respectively.",

This facility allows the tuning of the positron implantation energy from 0.1 to 20 keV. The positrons are emitted by a 22 Na source and moderated by a monocrystalline tungsten foil. The beam operates in vacuum at pressures between 10 \u22128 -10 \u22126 mbar. During the emulsion exposure, the gamma radiation carrying the information of the positron-electron annihilation process was simultaneously collected by two high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) both located at a distance of 9 cm from the target (see Figure 1). The positron rate at the target during the measurement at 18 keV was (7.6 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 3 s \u22121 . This estimate was performed by measuring the intrinsic efficiency of the HPGe detectors for photons of 511 keV (27\u00b11%) using a calibrated 22 Na source and taking into account the solid angle of the detector, the attenuation of the vacuum chamber, the emulsion and the aluminum holder, the positron backscattering, etc. After the exposures to positrons and the chemical development, the emulsions were analysed at the automatic microscopes of the scanning laboratory of the University of Bern, where fast data reconstruction based on GPU technology of large area emulsion surfaces is possible thanks to a recent development [6]. The reconstruction software was optimized for the present study, where positrons with energies at the keV scale have to be detected, to maximize the performances in terms of surface detection and cluster identification. Depending on the actual particle energy, the range in emulsion is limited to a few microns or even less than 1 \u00b5m, so that only 1-2 crystals are involved. Consequently it is not possible to reconstruct tridimensional tracks, as for the standard readout of emulsions exposed to more energetic particles, and isolated clusters need to be identified.",

The exposure time was set to (120 \u00b1 1)s for each energy, in order to have a sufficiently high signal to background ratio. A nearly gaussian positron spot (FWHM about 2.4 mm) was delivered to the emulsions for each energy. Then an area of about 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm 2 around each spot was fully scanned and processed. The positron beam profile at the energy of 15 keV is shown in Figure 2 where different colours account for the number of positrons in 10 4 \u00b5m 2 emulsion surface.  The number of positrons for each spot was evaluated under the assumptions of a gaussian distribution for the positron signal and of a linear background. The vertical beam profile histogram was then fitted and the resulting gaussian integrated to estimate the positron number. The total number of detected positrons as a function of the positron implantation energy is shown in Figure 3. The number of detected positrons after background subtraction ranges between \u223c 3-7\u00d710 5 and the statistical error, evaluated on the integral of the gaussian fit of the signal, was estimated to be between 0.2% -1.2%.

In principle, this could be due to both the increased number of positrons reaching the emulsion layer, and to the enhancement of the detection efficiency with the energy. In order to compare the number of events detected by the emulsion and the effective number of positrons implanted into the emulsion for each positron energy, the positron implantation profile was estimated by means of an algorithm based on the formulation developed by Ghosh et al. [7] and Aers et al. [8], [9], [10]. This semi-empirical method well reproduces the Monte Carlo stopping profiles in elemental multi-layers at the energy range of implanteted positrons investigated in the present work. The Ghosh-Aers formulation was adopted by virtue of its easiness and stability to small uncertainties of the material parameters. Moreover, it also accounts for the positron transmission and reflection in correspondence to each surface. A fraction of positrons is either backscattered by the emulsion protection layer or annihilated in the same layer [11] and the parameters used for the calculation depend on the properties of the multilayer materials, such as density and thickness. Even if their values for the protective and the emulsion layers had to be estimated from the literature [12], the model was considered sufficiently realistic for our purposes.  As they could not be directly measured, a conservative 10% error was assumed reflecting in the uncertanties reported in the table. As already mentioned at the energy of 3 keV and 6 keV, positrons do not reach the emulsion layer and therefore the corresponding values are not listed in the table. The evaluated number of positrons backscattered at the surface of the protective polymer layer does not depend on the energy and was found to be 5 \u00b1 1% [11]. The remaining 95% was considered for the calculation.",

The positron count below the annihilation peak was found to slightly decrease for increasing beam energy (the reduction with respect to the case of 9 keV being approximately 8% at 18 keV). This variation is due to the presence of a tungsten collimator along the positron path (see Figure 1). Indeed at high implantation energies a fraction of positrons does not pass through the collimator hole. This was kept into account by properly reweighting the integrated counts on the emulsions at energies from 9 to 15 keV with the corresponding positron flux. Therefore, the values shown in Figure 3 have been suitably rescaled.",

            "text": "We studied the sensitivity of the emulsion detector using a mono-energetic positron beam at low energies, between 9 keV and 18 keV. For this purpose we developed and realised a new emulsion detector, using a gel with enhanced content of silver bromide crystals poured on a glass plate. Nuclear emulsions were found to be highly efficient at detecting positrons at the considered energy range and the efficiency was found to be independent from the positron implantation energy. The experimental methodology described in this paper paves the way to matter-wave interferometry with positrons. Future exposures with a better knowledge of the incident positron flux for an improved assessment of the emulsion detection efficiency are being considered together with the exposure of an emulsion detector with a thinner protective layer in order to detect positrons with lower energies.
