The coincidence of these two events suggests that we will soon be able to address the question, what lies beyond the standard model? Particle physics's current understanding of the universe is embodied in it. The model has been tested to extreme precision -better than a part in ten thousand -but we suspect that it is only an approximation, and that physics beyond this standard model will appear in the data of the Tevatron and LHC in the near future. This brief review touches on the status of searches for new physics at the time of the conference.",

Their fiducial coverage extends further in \u03b7, and most systems have higher segmentation to handle the more demanding environment of the LHC. At design performance, the LHC will collide bunches every 25 ns (compared to 396 ns for the Tevatron) at an energy of \u221a s = 14 TeV (compared to just under 2 TeV at Fermilab.) The higher bunch intensities will lead to more than five times higher pileup, i.e., five times higher number of extra interactions per crossing, as well, and the overall design instantaneous luminosity of 10 34 /cm 2 /s is also 25 times higher than the maximum achieved at Fermilab.",

A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found elsewhere [9]. The detector consists of the pixel and silicon strip trackers. They provide coverage in the region |\u03b7| < 2.5 and are immersed in a 3.8 T magnetic field to allow momentum determination of charged particles. The electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters are used to detect energy deposits from electrons in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5 as well as to provide an estimate of missing transverse energy due to escaping particles. The electromagnetic calorimeter has an energy resolution of better than 0.5 % for unconverted photons with transverse energies above 100 GeV. A set of gaseous detectors outside the solenoids is used to detect the passage of minimum-ionizing particles, mainly muons.",

The presence of the new particle changes the measured quantity, such as a branching ratio, from its standard model expectation.

Many of the most sensitive early searches at the LHC involve strongly produced particles (which have large cross sections) that decay to hadronic final states (with large branching fractions.) The challenge with these searches is to suppress the equally large multi-jet background. Some of these searches are discussed below, including narrow dijet resonances, jets + E / T SUSY searches, and searches for SUSY in events with b jets and E / T .  Narrow resonances in dijet events. For the conference, ATLAS presented a new search for resonant dijet production of new particles. Using 0.81 fb \u22121 of data, the ATLAS collaboration calculates the invariant mass of pairs of jets (see Fig. 2 left) and looks for structure in the falling spectrum indicative of resonant s-channel production of new particles (e.g., gg \u2192 X \u2192 qq) [11]. These searches are sensitive to many new physics models such as excited quarks and contact interactions, and are also sensitive to quark substructure, and are therefore the modern equivalent of Rutherford scattering -relevant since the conference was dedicated to the Rutherford centennial. No significant excess was observed, and the collaboration presented the results as limits on the cross section times branching ratio times acceptance for both excited quarks (Fig. 2 middle) and for simple parameterized Gaussian shapes (Fig. 2 right.) In the latter case, the results are presented as a function of the mean of the Gaussian for several fractional widths (5-15%). Using these generic assumptions, limits are placed in the range of 1 \u2212 10 \u22122 pb for masses in the range of 1 \u2212 3 TeV/c 2 . CMS has released similar results [12].",

If Rparity is assumed to be conserved, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and usually assumed to be the dark matter candidate, i.e., neutral. In this case, the final state contains missing transverse momentum (E / T ) 1 due to the escaping undetected particles. As such the final state consists of jets and large E / T . The analysis uses 1 fb \u22121 of data collected using a trigger requiring a jet with E T > 75 GeV and E / T > 45 GeV. The measurement is optimized for different squark and gluino final states, and the final number of event counts is extracted by a likelihood fit to the a mass-like variable (m eff ), which is the sum of E / T and the magnitudes of the transverse momenta of the highest momentum jets considered in the analysis. No excess above SM expectation is observed, and limits are set in two ways: an mSUGRA scenario, and a simplified model where the only free parameters are the masses of the squarks and gluinos and the LSP mass is assumed to be zero. The results can be seen in Fig. 3. In the simplified models,   gluino (squark) masses below 700 (875)GeV/c 2 are excluded at the 95% confidence level, while in the mSUGRAinspired model squarks and gluinos of equal mass are disallowed for masses below 950 GeV/c 2 (tan \u03b2 = 10, A 0 = 0 and \u00b5 > 0) [13].

The analysis requires events with at least one jet with p T > 130 GeV/c, an additional jet with p T > 50 GeV/c and E / T > 130 GeV. The displacement of the common vertex of tracks associated with a jet with respect to the interaction point is used to identify b jets. Events with identified leptons are vetoed. There is no evidence for an excess beyond the SM expectations.

One search presented at the conference uses new techniques developed in collaboration between the theoretical and experimental communities that focus on the details of the structure of energy deposits within jets, originally proposed in conjunction with V H searches at the LHC [22]. The paper proposed selecting very boosted Higgs bosons such that the decay products of the Higgs are reconstructed as one jet with sub-jets, rather than as two distinct jets, and an algorithm for detecting such jet substructure. Since then many more techniques based on jet sub-and superstructure have been proposed, including those to detect boosted top quarks (\"top taggers\"), where the t \u2192 W b decay products are not reconstructed as distinct objects. The CMS collaboration has performed a search for Z \u2192 tt process where the top quarks are highly boosted and therefore the decay products of one or both of the top quarks is collimated into one jet (b quark, both hadronic W decay products in one jet) or two jets (both hadronic W decay products in one jet), rather than the usual three jets [23]. The use of this technique extends the sensitivity of the search to higher Z masses. Figure 7 left demonstrates the ability of the top taggers to find W bosons in a top-quark enriched data sample. No excess is observed beyond SM expectation. Analyzing 0.865 fb \u22121 of data, CMS sets a limit on \u03c3 Z \u00d7 B(Z \u2192 tt) < 1 pb for m < 1.1 TeV, as shown in Fig. 7 right.",

In 4.3 fb \u22121 of data, the collaboration reported an excess in the range 120 \u2212 160 GeV/c 2 . The excess was  deemed incompatible with the standard model expectations after taking all known statistical and systematic effects into account. In a conference result, CDF announced a result with an increased dataset (7.3 fb \u22121 ) [25] the significance of the excess increased from 3.2 to 4.1 standard deviations. Figure 8(a) shows the excess from the publication, as well the result from D0 [26]. Analyzing the same amount of data as the CDF publication (4.3 fb \u22121 ) the D0 analysis checks the CDF measurement and rules out a CDF-like excess at more than three standard deviations. At the LHC, ATLAS has also weighed in and cannot confirm the CDF result either [27]. At this point it is unclear what the origin of the difference between the CDF and D0 results is, though the collaborations have released a statement that the data of the two experiments is compatible with each other within 2.5 standard deviations.",
