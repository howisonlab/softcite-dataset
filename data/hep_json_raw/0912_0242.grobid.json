DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.051602 PACS numbers: 11.30.Hv, 12.15.Hh, 13.35.Dx, 14.60.Fg Decays of the lepton to a single charged particle and neutrino(s) probe the standard model (SM) predictions of charged current lepton universality and the unitarity relation of the first row of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix [1]. Previous measurements of universality [2,3], expressible in terms of the coupling strength (g ' ) of lepton of flavor ' to the charged gauge boson of the electroweak interaction are in agreement with the SM where g =g \u00bc g =g e \u00bc 1. Similarly, kaon decay measurements [3,4] sensitive to jV us j, the relative weak coupling between up and strange quarks, yield a value consistent with unitarity (jV ud j 2 \u00fe jV us j 2 \u00fe jV ub j 2 \u00bc 1), where nuclear beta decays provide jV ud j [5] and jV ub j is negligible [3]. However, new physics that couples primarily to the third generation could be revealed through deviations from the SM in precision universality and jV us j measurements involving the . Significant deviations of this nature are unambiguous signatures of new physics that provide crucial but complimentary information to the direct searches for Higgs bosons [6] and other new physics models with, e.g., lepto-quarks [7], heavy gauge W 0 or Z 0 bosons, heavy quarks or leptons, compositeness or extra dimensions [8].",

This Letter addresses both experimental and theoretical aspects of this question by providing the first precision measurements of R K B\u00f0 \u00c0 !K \u00c0 \u00de B\u00f0 \u00c0 !e \u00c0 e \u00de [10] and R K= B\u00f0 \u00c0 !K \u00c0 \u00de B\u00f0 \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00de enabled by the unique combination of a very large sample with particle momenta amenable to particle identification using Cherenkov radiation. By using values of the meson decay constants from lattice QCD [11], we provide two precision determinations of jV us j from decays independent of the OPE framework. We also report on new measurements of R B\u00f0 \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00de B\u00f0 \u00c0 !e \u00c0 e \u00de and R B\u00f0 \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00de B\u00f0 \u00c0 !e \u00c0 e \u00de . R provides an improved measurement of g =g e whereas R and R K , when compared to the muonic branching fractions of the pion and kaon, yield improved measurements of g =g involving pseudoscalar mesons.",

For good particle identification, each track is required to be within the acceptance of the DIRC and EMC, and have a transverse momentum greater than 0.25 GeV to ensure that it reaches the DIRC. The plane normal to the thrust axis divides the event into hemispheres in the CMframe. The ''signal'' hemisphere contains a single track and the ''tag'' hemisphere the other three tracks. Each tag hemisphere track is required to be consistent with being a pion and the energy deposited in the EMC unassociated with any tracks in this hemisphere is required to be less than 0.20 GeV. Also, events that contain track pairs consistent with coming from a K 0 S are vetoed. The signal track momentum is required to lie between 1 and 4 GeV=c. Information from the five detector subsystems is combined in likelihood selectors which identify e, , and K particles and in a neural network which identifies muons. The \u00c0 K separation is provided by the DIRC and DCH whereas \u00c0 separation is primarily accomplished with the IFR and EMC. The identification efficiencies are given in Table I and cross-contaminations are given below. We suppress di-muon and Bhabha backgrounds by requiring signal tracks identified as a lepton to have CMmomentum less than 80% of ffiffi ffi s p =2c. To reduce crossfeed from e into the and K channels, the ratio of deposited electromagnetic energy of a or K candidate track to its measured momentum, E=pc, is required to be less than 0.85. A pion track also passing a loose muon selection is rejected. A similar veto is applied for a kaon track passing the loose muon selection if its measured momentum exceeds 3 GeV=c. Also, events with an EMC energy >f1:0; 0:5; 0:2; 0:2g GeV in the signal hemisphere unassociated with the fe; ; ; Kg track are removed. Pion and kaon control samples from D \u00c3\u00fe ! \u00fe D 0 , D 0 ! \u00fe K \u00c0 decays are used to study and correct for small differences between MC and data. We cross-check these with independent \u00fe (K \u00c0 ) control samples from \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00fe ( \u00c0 ! K \u00c0 \u00c0 K \u00fe ) decays using particle identification of two of the oppositely charged particles and the fact that the wrong sign \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00c0 K \u00fe decays are heavily suppressed. Samples of radiative Bhabha and radiative -pair events provide control samples of electrons and muons. The systematic uncertainty associated with charged particle identification is assessed from the control sample statistical errors, consistency between control samples, and the sensitivity of the control sample corrections to the number of particles near the track. The statistical errors in the more limited crosscheck control samples dominate these errors. Because we use control samples to correct charge conjugate particles separately, charge-dependent detector responses are accounted for by construction.",

This results in less than 0.03% contamination from two-photon events and less than 0.1% contamination from Bhabha events in the electron signal sample. These backgrounds were investigated by studying samples enriched in Bhabha and two-photon events by adjusting the requirements on the thrust, cos\u00f0 CM miss \u00de, and transverse momentum of the event. Potential background from Bhabha events were further probed by studying the number of events having a high signal track momentum as the electron veto was progressively lifted from one, then two, and finally all three tracks in the tag hemisphere. To suppress backgrounds in the \u00c0 ! \u00c0 and \u00c0 ! K \u00c0 channels from decays with undetected neutral particles other than the (e.g., K 0 L mesons, ), we reconstruct the direction of the back-to-back \u00fe \u00c0 system in the CMframe.

These uncertainties include contributions from the particle identification, the sensitivity to detector response including the impact of changing the MC momentum scale and DCH resolution, modeling of hadronic and electromagnetic showers in the EMC, the EMC energy scale, and angular measurements made by these detectors within their modelling uncertainties, the backgrounds, initial-and final-state radiation, radiation in decays, rate and shape of \u00c0 ! \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00fe decays, the trigger, and L e \u00fe e \u00c0 ! \u00fe \u00c0 . The systematic uncertainty on R is dominated by uncertainties in particle identification. The R and R K measurements have additional dominant contributions from the detector modelling and associated backgrounds, due to stronger cuts on the EMC energy necessary to reduce non-backgrounds. Presence of the $20% backgrounds in these channels render them more sensitive to the modelling of the tagside decays. The dominant background uncertainty in the R measurement arises from the electron contamination in the sample investigated by measuring the number of events that fail the E=p electron veto requirement in data and MC. In the R K event sample, the uncertainty arising from decay branching fractions of background modes is 0.58%, which is dominated by the uncertainty of the \u00c0 ! K 0 L K \u00c0 fraction. There is also a 0.49% uncertainty assigned for q q backgrounds, which are studied using events with an invariant mass of the tracks in the tag hemisphere above the mass and cross-checked in regions of thrust and cos\u00f0 CM miss \u00de enriched with these backgrounds.",
