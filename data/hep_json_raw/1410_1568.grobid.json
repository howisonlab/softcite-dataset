            "text": "PACS numbers: 13.20.He, 14.40.Nd The decays of hadrons containing a b quark are dominated by the weak interaction of the b quark. In firstorder calculations, the decay widths of these hadrons are independent of the flavor of the accompanying light quark(s). Higher-order predictions break this symmetry, with the spectator quarks having roles in the time evolution of the B hadron decay [1,2]. The flavor dependence leads to an expected lifetime hierarchy of \u03c4 (B c ) < \u03c4 (\u039b b ) < \u03c4 (B 0 s ) \u2248 \u03c4 (B 0 ) < \u03c4 (B + ), which has been observed experimentally [3]. The ratios of the lifetimes of different b hadrons are precisely predicted by heavy quark effective theories and provide a way to experimentally study these higher-order effects, and to test for possible new physics beyond the standard model [4]. * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c DESY, Hamburg, Existing measurements are in excellent agreement with predictions [3] for the lifetime ratio \u03c4 (B + )/\u03c4 (B 0 ), but until recently the experimental precision has been insufficient to test the corresponding theoretical prediction for \u03c4 (B 0 s )/\u03c4 (B 0 ). In particular, predictions using inputs from unquenched lattice QCD calculations give 0.996 < \u03c4 (B 0 s )/\u03c4 (B 0 ) < 1 [2]. More precise measurements of both B 0 s lifetime and the ratio to its lighter counterparts are needed to test and refine the models.",

All other sources investigated are found to be negligible. The effect of possible mismodeling of the decay length resolution is tested by repeating the lifetime fit with alternative resolution models, using a single Gaussian component. A systematic uncertainty is assigned based on the shift in the measured lifetime. We repeat the fit using different combinatorial background samples using only the sideband data or only the wrong-sign sample. The maximum deviation from the central lifetime measurement is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. To determine the effect of uncertainties on the K factors for the signal events, the fractions of the different components are varied within their uncertainties given in Table I. We also recalculate the K factors using different MC decay models [16] leading to a harder p T distribution of the generated B hadrons. The fraction of each component from semileptonic decays is varied within its uncertainties, and the shift in the measured lifetime is used to assign a systematic uncertainty. The signal fraction parameter, f Ds\u00b5 , is fixed for each mass fit performed. We vary this parameter within its statistical and systematic uncertainty, obtained from fit variations to the background and signal model of the mass PDFs, and assign the observed deviation as the uncertainty arising from this source. Finally, to assess the effect of possible detector mis-alignment, a single MC sample is passed through two different reconstruction algorithms, corresponding to the nominal detector alignment and an alternative model with tracking detector elements shifted spatially within their uncertainties. The observed change in the lifetime is taken as systematic uncertainty due to alignment. Table III lists the contributions to the systematic uncertainty from all sources considered. The most significant effect comes from the combinatorial background determination. Correlations in the systematic uncertainties for the B 0 s and B 0 meson lifetimes are taken into account when evaluating the effect on the lifetime ratio, where the K factor determination dominates.",

Combining this result and that of Ref. [10] with global fits of lifetime measurements in B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 decays [6] gives the most precise determination of the fundamental parameters \u2206\u0393 s and \u0393 s which are important for constraining CP violation in the B 0 s system. Our precise measurement of the ratio of B 0 s and B 0 lifetimes can be used to test and refine theoretical QCD predictions and offers a sensitive test of new physics [4].",
