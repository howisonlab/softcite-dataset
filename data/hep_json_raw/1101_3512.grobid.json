The dataset, corresponding to 85 nb \u22121 , was recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC using a low-threshold single-muon trigger. Events are selected by the presence of a muon with transverse momentum p \u00b5 T > 6 GeV with respect to the beam direction and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 2.1. The transverse momentum of the muon with respect to the closest jet discriminates events containing b hadrons from background. The inclusive b-hadron production cross section is presented as a function of muon transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The measured total cross section in the kinematic acceptance is \u03c3(pp \u2192 b + X \u2192 \u00b5 + X ) = 1.32 \u00b1 0.01(stat) \u00b1 0.30(syst) \u00b1 0.15(lumi)\u00b5b.",

Results on b-hadron production in proton-antiproton collisions at the lower center-of-mass energies, \u221a s, of the CERN SppS Collider [1] and the Tevatron [2-5] have aroused substantial interest because of tensions between the experimental results and the theoretical expectations [6,7]. First results at the LHC from pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV have been reported by the LHCb collaboration for the forward rapidity region using semiinclusive decays [8] and by the CMS collaboration in the central rapidity region using fully reconstructed B + hadron decays [9].",

            "text": "The b-quark production cross section in hadron collisions has been computed at nextto-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD [10][11][12]. The observed large scale dependence of the NLO results is considered to be a symptom of large contributions from higher orders: small-x effects [13,14], where x \u223c m b / \u221a s, are possibly relevant in the low-p T domain, while multiple-gluon radiation leads to large logarithms of p T /m b and may be important at high p T [15]. The resummed logarithms of p T /m b at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy have been matched to the fixed-order NLO calculation for massive quarks [16]. At the nonperturbative level, the b-hadron p T spectrum depends strongly on the parametrization of the fragmentation function [17]. The b-quark production cross section has also been studied in the general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme [18] and the k T factorization QCD approach [19,20].",

The inner tracker is immersed in a 3.8 T axial magnetic field. The pixel tracker consists of three barrel layers and two endcap disks at each barrel end. The strip tracker has 10 barrel layers and 12 end-cap disks at each barrel end. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yokes. In the barrel, there is a drift tube system interspersed with resistive plate chambers (RPCs), and in the end-caps there is a cathode strip chamber system, also interspersed with RPCs. The first-level (L1) trigger used in this analysis is based on the muon system alone, while the high-level trigger (HLT) uses additional information from the inner tracker.",

Since the shape of the p rel \u22a5 distribution in c and light-quark/gluon (udsg) events cannot be distinguished by the fit, the two background components are combined and a fit discriminating the signal component against a single background component is implemented. The udsg background is dominated by hadrons misidentified as muons (mainly in-flight decays) and is determined in data. Hadrons satisfying all muon track selection criteria (without muon detector requirements) are weighted by the misidentification probability and used instead of muons to determine p rel \u22a5 . The misidentification probability has been measured in data [42]. The c background is determined from MC simulation. Muons from sources other than b, c and udsg events are neglected. The largest contribution to the muon event sample from these sources is expected in the highest p \u00b5 T bin (3%, from W decays). The result of the fit in the full sample is displayed in figure 1. A b fraction of 46% is observed. Extensive tests to validate the fitting procedure were performed [43] with repeated fits of MC pseudo-experiments obtained by appropriate random variations. A satisfactory performance of the fit was observed: the fit result does not show a significant bias and the errors are properly calculated by the fitter. The stability of the fit was proven by repeated fits with varied binning. The signal fractions have also been determined with particle flow jets [44] and with a fit to the muon impact parameter distribution.
