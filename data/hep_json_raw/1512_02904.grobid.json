            "text": "The study of heavy-flavor production in pp collisions at LHC energies allows us to test perturbative QCD calculations and provides a reference for studies in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements in p-Pb collisions help to characterize the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the collision (cold nuclear matter effects). ALICE provided measurements of p T -differential cross sections for D-meson production at central rapidity in pp [1,2,3] and p-Pb [4] collisions, and of the nuclear modification factor, R pPb . More differential measurements of charm production in pp and p-Pb collisions can provide further insight on the above topics. The study of heavy-flavor production in pp collisions as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity allows us to investigate the interplay between hard and soft QCD processes responsible for particle production in hadronic collisions. It also provides information on the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI) in the heavyflavor sector. Moreover, the analysis of angular correlations between heavy-flavor particles and charged particles is a tool to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and is sensitive to their production mechanism. Differences between the measurements in pp and p-Pb collisions can give insight on how cold nuclear matter effects affect heavy-quark production and hadronization in p-Pb collisions.",

This observable is defined as the ratio of the D-meson per-event yield in a given multiplicity interval over the multiplicity-integrated yield. The number of track segments in the two innermost layers of the Inner Tracking System in |\u03b7| < 1 is used as multiplicity estimator; it is found to be proportional to the density of charged particles at central pseudorapidity. The fraction f B of D mesons from B-hadron decays (feed-down), evaluated on the basis of FONLL calculations [6], is assumed independent of the charged-particle multiplicity, hence it cancels out in the self-normalized yields. The results obtained for D 0 , D + and D * + mesons are in agreement. This allows us to evaluate a weighted average of the measurements for the three mesons, to reduce the statistical uncertainties.",

J/\u03a8 are reconstructed at central rapidity (|y| < 0.9) in the e + e \u2212 decay channel and at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4) in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channel [13]. A similar increase with event multiplicity is found for the open and hidden charm self-normalized yields, suggesting that this behavior is driven by quark production mechanisms, rather than by their hadronization. The same trend is also observed for the production of open charm and open beauty, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2, where the multiplicity dependence of the self-normalized yields of D meson and non-prompt J/\u03a8 is compared.        The contribution due to D-meson combinatorial background is removed by subtracting the correlation distribution evaluated from the sidebands of the D-meson invariant mass distribution. A correction for detector inhomogeneities and limited acceptance is applied exploiting the event-mixing technique. Efficiency corrections for reconstruction and selection of trigger and associated particles are performed. The contribution of D mesons from B feed-down is subtracted. In particular, the templates of the angular correlations of feed-down D mesons and charged particles are built using PYTHIA simulations [14] and normalized to the amount of feed-down contribution evaluated from FONLL calculations [6]. A projection on the \u2206\u03d5 axis, limited to the range |\u2206\u03b7| < 1, is performed. The azimuthal correlation distributions of D 0 , D + and D * + mesons are compatible within uncertainties. A weighted average of the three D-meson measurements is hence performed, to reduce the statistical uncertainty on the points. The per-trigger azimuthal correlation distributions are fitted with two Gaussian functions on top of a constant (baseline), to extract physical observables such as the near-side yield, near-side width and height of the baseline.",
