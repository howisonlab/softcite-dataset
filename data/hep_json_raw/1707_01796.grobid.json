In the J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution we observe a signal with a statistical significance of 4.1 \u03c3 . Its mass and width are consistent with those of the X(3872). The shape of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution from the observed decay into J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 shows disagreement with previous observations for X (3872). The observed signal may be interpreted as a possible evidence of a new charmonium state. It could be associated with a neutral partner of X(3872) with C = \u22121 predicted by a tetraquark model. The product of cross section and branching fraction of the decay of the observed state into J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is determined to be 71\u00b128(stat)\u00b139(syst) pb.",

Charged partners of the X(3872) have not been observed [26]. The X(3872) hadron is peculiar in several aspects and its nature is still not well understood. In particular, approximately equal probabilities to decay into J /\u03c8 3\u03c0 and J /\u03c8 2\u03c0 final states B(X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c9)/B(X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 [27] indicate large isospin-symmetry breaking. There are several interpretations of this hadron: pure cc-state, tetraquark, meson-meson molecule, cc g meson, glueball, or others (see reviews [28][29][30]). In addition to knowing mass and quantum numbers of this state, the measurement of its width would provide a crucial input to narrow down speculations on its nature. Currently such a measurement can only be done by performing energy scans in pp annihilations, as it is foreseen at FAIR [31,32].",

The data used in the present analysis were obtained by scattering positive muons of 160 GeV/c or 200 GeV/c momentum off solid 6 LiD or NH 3 targets. The total data set accumulated between 2003 and 2011 was used. The target material was arranged in two or three cylindrical cells placed along the beam direction. It was longitudinally or transversely polarized with respect to this direction. The polarization is opposite in consecutive target cells, and it is reversed periodically during data taking. After combining data with opposite polarization, possible effects from residual target polarization have negligible influence on this analysis. Particle tracking and identification were performed using a two-stage spectrometer, covering a wide momentum range from about 1 GeV/c up to the beam momentum. The event trigger was based on scintillator hodoscopes and hadron calorimeters. Different trigger schemes were used for the different data sets. Possible differences in trigger efficiencies are expected to cancel in the determination of absolute production https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2018.07.008 0370-2693/\u00a9 2018 The Author.

In order to select such events, we first require a reconstructed vertex in the target region with an incoming beam muon track, three outgoing muon tracks (two \u03bc + , one \u03bc \u2212 ) and three outgoing pions (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 ). Reconstructed particles are identified as muons if they have momentum above 8 GeV/c and have crossed more than 15 radiation lengths of material. The muon identification efficiency for such energetic particles is higher than 90%. Other charged particles are assumed to be pions. Since the dimuon mass resolution of the setup for the J /\u03c8 peak is about 50 MeV/c 2 [35], candidates for J /\u03c8 decaying into a pair of oppositely charged muons are accepted if their reconstructed mass lies in the range from 3.02 GeV/c 2 to 3.18 GeV/c 2 . With two \u03bc + in a given event, we may reconstruct two J /\u03c8 candidates in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 final state, in which case the event is rejected (\u223c3% of events). The nominal J /\u03c8 mass [24] is assigned to accepted dimuons. In order to select exclusive production in process (2), we require E to match the energy E beam of the beam particle, except for a small recoil energy to the target. Here, E is the sum of energies of the scattered muon, of the J /\u03c8 , and of the three pions in the final state. Since at COMPASS the experimental resolution for E = E \u2212 E beam is about 2 GeV, we require | E| < 4 GeV in order to select exclusive production of the J /\u03c83\u03c0 final state. The total number of selected exclusive \u03bc + J /\u03c82\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03bc + J /\u03c8\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 events is 72 and 49, respectively. The ratio (72/49) corresponds approximately to the ratio of the average numbers of protons and neutrons in the target material that is \u223c 1.3. Fig. 2(a) shows the mass spectrum for the J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 subsystem in reaction (2) from threshold to 5 GeV/c 2 after the aforementioned selection criteria were applied. As there are two equally charged pions per event, this mass spectrum contains contributions from the two possible \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 combinations. The mass spectrum exhibits two peak structures below 4 GeV/c 2 , with positions and widths that are compatible with the production and decay of \u03c8(2S) and X(3872). However, for reasons that will be described below, we prefer to name the particle corresponding to the second peak observed for the reaction (2) as X(3872). We determine the resonance parameters by a maximum likelihood fit to the mass spectrum from threshold to 5 GeV/c 2 , using a sum of two Gaussian functions for the two signal peaks and the background term ",

They found a preference for high \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 masses and a dominance of the X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c1 0 decay mode. The measured two-pion mass spectra for events produced in reaction (2) within a \u00b130 MeV/c 2 mass window around the \u03c8(2S) (blue) and the X(3872) (red) are shown in Fig. 7(a). The result for \u03c8(2S) is in a good agreement with former observations, while the shape of the \u03c0\u03c0 mass distribution for X (3872) looks very different from the well-known results for X(3872). The comparison of the two-pion mass distributions from X(3872) decay obtained by COMPASS and from X(3872) decay obtained by ATLAS [22] (the ATLAS result is taken as a typical high-precision example) is presented in Fig. 7(b). The cut M miss > 3 GeV/c 2 is applied for Fig. 7(b) to reduce underlying background contribution in the X(3872) sample. Our studies show that the observed differ-  ence cannot be explained by acceptance effects. Within statistical uncertainties, the shape of the COMPASS \u03c0\u03c0 mass distribution is in agreement with a three-body phase-space decay and with the expectation for a state with quantum numbers J P C = 1 +\u2212 [40], while the quantum numbers previously determined for the X(3872) are 1 ++ . A possible distortion of the two-pion mass spectrum by non-resonant background under the peak was estimated using the sPlot procedure [43] and was found to be unlikely for reaction (2). The statistical significance of the disagreement between the observed two-pion mass spectrum and the expected one from the known decay X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c1 0 was estimated using the maximum likelihood approach and was found to be between 4.7\u03c3 and 7.3\u03c3 depending on the treatment of the residual background under the X(3872) peak. We investigated the possibility to obtain the observed two-pion spectrum from the decay X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c9 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 where the \u03c0 0 has been lost, and excluded it. A possibility to have visible contribution from the \u03c7 c0,1,2 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03b3 decay, followed by the photon conversion into e + e \u2212 misidentified as \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , was also investigated and excluded.",
