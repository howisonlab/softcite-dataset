Model comparisons indicate a dominant non-diffractive contribution up to moderately large \u03b7 F and small \u03be , with a diffractive contribution which is significant at the highest \u03b7 F and the lowest \u03be . The rapidity-gap survival probability is estimated from comparisons of the data in this latter region with predictions based on diffractive parton distribution functions.",

The jet transverse momentum provides a natural hard scale for perturbative QCD calculations, making the process sensitive to the underlying parton dynamics of diffraction and colour-singlet exchange. A model [8] in which the hard scattering is factorised from a colourless component of the proton with its own partonic content (diffractive parton distribution functions, DPDFs), corresponding to the older concept of a pomeron [9], has been successful in describing diffractive deep inelastic scattering (ep \u2192 e Xp) at HERA [10]. The DPDFs have been extracted from fits to HERA data in the framework of next-to-leading-order QCD, revealing a highly gluondominated structure [11,12]. E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch.",

Tevatron data [7] show a suppression of the measured cross section by a factor of typically 10 relative to predictions. A similar 'rapidity-gap survival probability' factor, usually denoted by S 2 , was suggested by the first results from the LHC [15]. This factorisation breaking is usually attributed to secondary scattering from beam remnants, also referred to as absorptive corrections, and closely related to the multiple-scattering effects which are a primary focus of underlying-event studies [16][17][18]. Understanding these effects more deeply is an important step towards a complete model of diffractive processes at hadronic colliders and may point the way towards a reconciliation of the currently very different theoretical treatments of soft and hard strong interactions.",

            "text": "In both PYTHIA8 and POMWIG, hard scattering in diffractive processes takes place through the factorisable pomeron mechanism [8] illustrated in Fig. 1. A pomeron couples to an incoming proton, acquiring a fraction \u03be of the proton's longitudinal momentum. The proton either scatters elastically (SD) or dissociates to form a higher-mass system (DD). A parton from the pomeron (as described by DPDFs) then undergoes a hard scattering with a parton from the dissociating proton at a scale set by the transverse momenta of the resulting jets. The dissociation system X has an invariant mass M X , such that \u03be = M 2 X /s at a proton-proton centreof-mass energy \u221a s. POMWIG is based on a standard implementation of hard diffractive scattering with a factorisable pomeron, in which both the pomeron flux and the DPDFs are taken from the results of the H1 2006 DPDF fit B 1 [11] and the proton PDF set is CTEQ61 [23]. In contrast, PYTHIA8 provides a simultaneous model of hard and soft diffraction [24], in which a soft diffractive model inherited from PYTHIA6 [25] is smoothly interfaced to a hard diffractive model similar to that in POMWIG. The probability of using the hard model depends on M X . The H1 2006 DPDF fit B is again used for the partonic content of the pomeron and the proton partonic structure is taken from the CT10 PDFs [26]. Several different pomeron flux parameterisations are available in PYTHIA8. In addition to the default Schuler and Sj\u00f6strand (S-S) model [27], alternative parameterisations by Donnachie and Landshoff (D-L) [28] and Berger and Streng [29,30], as well as the Minimum Bias Rockefeller (MBR) model [31], are also considered in this analysis. These models differ primarily in their predictions for the \u03be dependence of the cross section [24]. The DD process in PYTHIA8 is modelled similarly to the SD process. Neither of the diffractive models con- 1 The H1 Fit B DPDFs correspond to the sum of the SD process and the component of the DD process where the lower of the two proton dissociation masses is smaller than 1.6 GeV (see Section 6). sidered here take rapidity-gap destruction effects into account, i.e. they set the rapidity gap survival probability S 2 \u2261 1.",

The beam-line is surrounded by a tracking system, which covers the pseudorapidity 2 range |\u03b7| < 2.5, consists of silicon pixel, silicon strip and straw tube detectors and is immersed in the 2 T axial magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. The calorimeters lie outside the tracking system. A highly segmented electromagnetic (EM) liquid-argon sampling calorimeter covers the range |\u03b7| < 3.2. The EM calorimeter also includes a presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8. The hadronic end-cap (HEC, 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward (FCAL, 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) calorimeters also use liquid argon for their sensitive layers, but with reduced granularity. Hadronic energy in the central region is reconstructed in a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter. The shapes of the cell noise distributions in the calorimeters are well described by Gaussian distributions, with the exception of the tile calorimeter, where the noise has extended tails, and which is thus excluded from the rapidity gap finding aspects of the analysis. Minimum-bias trigger scintillator (MBTS) detectors are mounted in front of the end-cap calorimeters on both sides of the interaction point and cover the pseudorapidity range 2.1 < |\u03b7| < 3.8. The MBTS is divided into inner and outer rings, both of which have eight-fold segmentation. In the analysis, two trigger systems are used at Level-1 (L1), namely the MBTS which efficiently collects low-p T jets, and the calorimeter-based trigger (L1Calo) which concentrates on higher-p T jets. In 2010, the luminosity was measured by monitoring the activity in forward detector components, with calibration determined through van der Meer beam scans [38,39].",

These requirements correspond to the region in which the jet energy scale and resolution are well known and in which the jets are fully contained within the detector. Several sources of background were investigated. To reject contributions from beam interactions with residual gas in the beampipe, muons from upstream proton interactions travelling as a halo around the proton beam, and cosmic-ray muons, events are required to have a primary vertex constructed from at least two tracks and consistent with the beam spot position. In-time pile-up, caused by multiple interactions in one bunch crossing, is suppressed by requiring that there be no further vertices with two or more associated tracks. Out-of-time pile-up, caused by overlapping signals in the detector from neighbouring bunch crossings, was investigated and found to be negligible at the large bunch spacings (>5 \u03bcs) of the chosen runs. Once an event is triggered and the dijet selection criteria are met, the requirement on the primary vertex removes 0.3% and 0.2% of events in the L1Caloand MBTS-triggered data, respectively, while the in-time pile-up suppression cuts remove 9.4% and 6.5%, respectively. The latter values are used to scale the cross sections to account for the corresponding losses. Residual background occurs due to the limited position resolution of the vertex reconstruction, which typically merges pairs of vertices with z 1 cm into a single vertex. The size of this effect is estimated by extrapolation to lower values of the z distribution for pairs of vertices which are resolved and its influence is evaluated by randomly overlaying minimum-bias events on the selected sample. The effect is smaller than 0.5% in all bins of the measured distributions. The residual beam-induced background is studied using 'unpaired' bunch crossings in which only one bunch of protons passes through the ATLAS detector and is found to be negligible.",

The treatment of calorimeter information in the rapidity-gap determination follows the procedure introduced in Ref. [43], such that the requirement p T > 200 MeV for calorimeter clusters from the previous rapidity-gap analysis [2] is removed. Since this transverse momentum requirement corresponds to a very high momentum at large pseudorapidities, the modified approach more completely exploits the capabilities of AT-LAS to detect low-momentum particles in the calorimeters.

This procedure corrects for migrations between the particle and detector levels based on an 'unfolding' matrix, constructed from a combination of PYTHIA8 ND, SD and DD samples, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The MC combination is optimised in a simple fitting procedure in which scaling factors are applied to the ND and (SD+DD) components to best match the data. The IDS unfolding is performed in two dimensions, corresponding to the p T of the leading jet and the target distribution (either \u03b7 F or \u03be ). The results of the IDS procedure depend in general on the number of iterations used. A fast convergence is achieved for both measured distributions and the fourth iteration is chosen as nominal since it optimises the balance between the systematic and statistical uncertainty arising from the unfolding procedure. The unfolding procedure is stable against variations in binning, number of iterations and the scaling factors applied to the diffractive and non-diffractive contributions in the PYTHIA8 model, as discussed further in Section 5.",

The particlelevel gap is defined by the region of pseudorapidity with an absence of neutral particles with p > 200 MeV and charged particles with either p > 500 MeV or p T > 200 MeV. The conclusions are not strongly dependent on the choice of R parameter in the anti-k t jet algorithm, although the cross-section normalisations are about two times larger for R = 0.6 than for R = 0.4.

No attempt has been made to fully assess the model-dependence uncertainty, although changing the ND contribution in the extraction from PYTHIA8 to POWHEG + PYTHIA8 results in an S 2 of 0.15 and indications from elsewhere [14,15] suggest that S 2 might be smaller if NLO models were used. The result is compatible with the values of 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.08 \u00b1 0.04, obtained by CMS in LO and NLO analyses, respectively, using the region 0.0003 < \u03be < 0.002 and a jet R parameter of 0.5 [15]. The result is also compatible with that obtained at lower centre-of-mass energy at the Tevatron [7], which was reevaluated in a subsequent NLO analysis [49] to be between 0.05 and 0.3, depending on the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the parton entering the hard scattering. Theoretical predictions for S 2 at the LHC [50,51] are also compatible with the result here, although the predicted decrease with increasing centre-ofmass energy is not yet established.",

The data are characterised according to the size of the forward rapidity gap, quantified by \u03b7 F and \u03be , which for the single-diffractive case approximates the fractional longitudinal momentum loss of the scattered proton using the information available within the detector acceptance. Non-diffractive Monte Carlo models are capable of describing the data over a wide kinematic range. However, a diffractive component is also required for a more complete description of the data, particularly when both large \u03b7 F and small \u03be are required. The PYTHIA8 model gives the best description of the shape and normalisation of this contribution.",

[2], the clustering algorithm accepts calorimeter cells as cluster seeds if their measured response is approximately five standard deviations above the root-mean-square noise level, with a small dependence of the threshold on pseudorapidity. Cells neighbouring the seed cell are included in the cluster if their measured energies exceed smaller threshold requirements defined by the standard ATLAS topological clustering method.
