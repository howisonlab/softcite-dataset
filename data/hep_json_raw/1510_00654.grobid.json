To confirm the existing difference between the calculated (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 value [1] and the measured one [2], new measurements of the exclusive channels of e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons with better accuracy are required. A contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from e + e \u2212 \u2192 KK\u03c0\u03c0 at the center-of-mass (c.m.) energies below 2 GeV is (3.31 \u00b1 0.58) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , estimated using isospin relations [1]. However, this result strongly depends on assumptions made about the presence of intermediate resonances, necessitating therefore a thorough study of the process dynamics in various KK\u03c0\u03c0 final states (K",

The Cryogenic Magnetic Detector (CMD-3) described in [9] is installed in one of the two beam interaction regions. The detector tracking system consists of the cylindrical drift chamber (DC) and double-layer cylindrical multiwire proportional Z-chamber, both also are used for a trigger and installed inside a thin (0.085 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with 1.3 T magnetic field. DC contains 1218 hexagonal cells in 18 layers and allows one to measure charged particle momentum with 1.5-4.5% accuracy in the (100-1000) MeV/c range, and the polar (\u03b8) and azimuthal (\u03c6) angles with 20 mrad and 3.5-8.0 mrad accuracy, respectively. Amplitude information from the DC wires is used to measure the ionization losses (dE/dx DC ) of charged particles with \u03c3 dE/dx DC =11-14% accuracy. The barrel electromagnetic calorimeters based on liquid xenon (LXe) (5.4 X 0 ) and CsI crystals (8.1 X 0 ) are placed outside the solenoid [10]. The total amount of material in front of the calorimeter is 0.13 X 0 that includes the solenoid as well as the radiation shield and vacuum vessel walls. BGO crystals (13.4 X 0 ) are used as the endcap calorimeter. The flux return yoke is surrounded by scintillation counters which are used to tag cosmic events.",

It can be seen that dE/dx DC differ significantly for kaons and pions for momenta less than 500 MeV/c, while dE/dx LXe differ even at higher momenta, so one can perform K/\u03c0 separation in the whole particle momentum range. The distributions of the ionization losses have different  shapes in the DC and the LXe calorimeter. It is Gaussian for dE/dx DC , while nuclear interactions are likely in the LXe calorimeter, resulting in the wide tails of the dE/dx LXe distribution, in which about 20% of the events are located. Simulation of nuclear interactions of kaons and pions in LXe is not perfect, especially at low momenta, so using simulated dE/dx LXe results in uncontrollable systematic uncertainties. Thus an experimental input is required for studying energy deposition of particles in the LXe calorimeter and ionization losses in the drift chamber are only used in this analysis. This results in a less than 0.5% uncertainty in K/\u03c0 separation estimated from simulation, where the particle type and the number of misidentified particles are known. This uncertainty is negligible compared to the total systematic error (discussed in section 7). We use momentum and dE/dx DC values for each track to construct probability density functions (PDF) for kaons f K (p, dE/dx DC ) and pions f \u03c0 (p, dE/dx DC ), each of which is a sum of Gaussian and logarithmic Gaussian distributions. The parameters of PDF are determined by approximating the dE/dx DC histogram by PDF. The parameters of these functions are fitted by smooth lines which depend on momentum. First we use a sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events to determine f \u03c0 (p, dE/dx DC ), then the function f K (p, dE/dx DC ) is determined using e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events. The control sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events is selected using strong cuts, that reject the background to the level of less than 0.5%. The background in the sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events is about 1% and will discussed below in this section. This procedure is performed separately for simulation and ex- periment. The approximation of the simulated dE/dx DC distribution with a sum of two functions f K (p, dE/dx DC ) and f \u03c0 (p, dE/dx DC ) in the momentum range 470-520 MeV/c is presented in Fig. 4.",

The condition on L KK\u03c0\u03c0 allows one to significantly reduce the number of such background events. Application of the requirements |\u2206E KK\u03c0\u03c0 | < 80 MeV, P tot < 80 MeV/c and L KK\u03c0\u03c0 > \u22123 decreased the background to less than 1% level as estimated using the multihadron Monte Carlo generator [17]. In this generator all experimentally measured processes of e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons up to 2 GeV are used to calculate a total cross section at a given c.m. energy and events of each final state are sampled with a probability proportional to the fraction of its measured cross section in the total one.

Using the total momentum of three detected tracks and momentum conservation, we calculate the energy of the missing particle and add it to the energy of the detected particles to obtain the total energy E 3+1 for these events. The histogram in Fig. 7 shows the difference between the calculated total energy for events with one missing particle and the c.m. energy, \u2206E 3+1 = E 3+1 \u2212 E c.m. . To extract the yield of signal events, we fit this distribution with a signal function and a linear background.

Our results agree with the previous measurements and have comparable or better statistical precision. This final state exhibits complex resonant substructures. Our tentative study of dynamics shows the following major intermediate mechanisms: e + e \u2212 \u2192 (K 1 (1270)K) S\u2212wave \u2192 (K * \u03c0) S\u2212wave K, e + e \u2212 \u2192 (K 1 (1400)K) S\u2212wave \u2192 (K * \u03c0) S\u2212wave K, e + e \u2212 \u2192 (K 1 (1270)K) S\u2212wave \u2192 (\u03c1K) S\u2212wave K, e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c6, e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 0 (500)\u03c6 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1(KK) S\u2212wave . Simulation based on these models is in good agreement with the experimental data and allows one to measure the total cross section with a systematic uncertainty falling from 11.7% at 1500-1600 MeV to 6.1% above 1800 MeV. After VEPP-2000 upgrade it will be possible to perform a more detailed analysis of dynamics using higher statistics and various charge combinations of the KK\u03c0\u03c0 final state. We also plan to improve K/\u03c0 separation by using additionally ionization losses in the xenon barrel calorimeter.",

The likelihood function value is a good parameter for separating K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events from the background. We applied a requirement L KK\u03c0\u03c0 > \u22123 which retains more than 95% of signal events.We assign pion or kaon mass to each track and calculate total energy E KK\u03c0\u03c0 .Figure 6shows a scatter plot of the difference \u2206E KK\u03c0\u03c0 = E KK\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 E c.m. vs the total momentum for events with four tracks assuming all events to be e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and the condition L KK\u03c0\u03c0 > \u22123 applied. Events of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are located near the origin of the coordinates.The width of the E KK\u03c0\u03c0 distribution for K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events is a few times smaller than that of the E 4\u03c0 distribution while the shapes of the background distribution are the same for E 4\u03c0 and E KK\u03c0\u03c0 . For that reason, conditions on \u2206E KK\u03c0\u03c0 and P tot allow to suppress the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) background.

It was found that the main intermediate mechanisms are e + e \u2212 \u2192 (K 1 (1270, 1400)K) S\u2212wave \u2192 (K * \u03c0) S\u2212wave K, their contribution is about 50-90% and depends on c.m. energy. The K 1 (1270) and K 1 (1400) are broad resonances and phase space of the K 1 K system is small at energies smaller than 2 GeV. So a much larger sample is needed for separation of the intermediate states with these particles.",
