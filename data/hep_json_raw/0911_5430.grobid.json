The second normalization (non-single-diffractive or NSD) applies this correction for non-diffractive and double-diffractive processes only, while removing, on average, the single-diffractive contribution.",

            "text": "Multiparticle production is rather successfully described by phenomenological models with Pomeron exchange, which dominates at high energies [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. These models relate the energy dependence of the total cross section to that of the multiplicity production using a small number of parameters, and are the basis for several Monte Carlo event generators describing soft hadron collisions (see for example [12][13][14][15][16]). According to these models, it is expected that the charged-particle density increases by a factor 1.7 and 1.9 when raising the LHC centre-of-mass energy from 900 GeV to 7 and 14 TeV respectively (i.e. intermediate and nominal LHC energies). The difference in charged-particle densities between pp and pp interactions is predicted to decrease as 1/ \u221a s at high energies [17]. This difference was last measured at the CERN ISR to be in the range 1.5-3% [18,19] at \u221a s = 53 GeV. Extrapolating these values to \u221a s = 900 GeV, one obtains a very small difference of about 0.1-0.2%. Therefore, we will compare our measurement to existing pp data and also to different Monte Carlo models.",

The bunches used were the so-called \"pilot bunches\": low intensity bunches used during machine commissioning, with a few 10 9 protons per bunch. The two beams were brought into the nominal position for collisions without a specific attempt to maximize the interaction rate. The nominal r.m.s. size of LHC beams at injection energy is about 300 \u00b5m in the transverse direction and 10.5 cm in the longitudinal (z-axis) direction. However, at this early stage, the beam parameters can deviate from these nominal values; they were not measured for the fill used in this analysis. For the previous fill, for which the longitudinal size was measured, it was found to be shorter, with an r.m.s. of about 8 cm. Assuming Gaussian beam profiles, the luminous region should be smaller than the beam size by a factor of \u221a 2 in all directions. Shortly after circulating beams were established, the AL-ICE data acquisition system [20,21] started collecting events with a trigger based on the Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD), requiring two or more hits in the SPD in coincidence with the passage of the two colliding bunches as inferred from beam pickup detectors. As a precaution, only a small subset of the detector subsystems, including the silicon tracking detectors and the scintillator trigger counters, was turned on, in order to assess the beam conditions provided by the LHC.",

In coincidence with the passage of the bunch of one circulating beam the rate was 0.006 Hz. As soon as the second beam was injected in the accelerator, the event rate increased significantly, to 0.11 Hz. The first event that was analyzed and displayed in the counting room by the offline reconstruction software AliRoot [22] running in online mode is shown in Fig. 1. This marked symbolically the keenly anticipated start of the physics exploitation of the ALICE experiment. 4 The online reconstruction software implemented in the High-Level Trigger (HLT) computer farm [23] also analyzed the events in real time and calculated the vertex position of the collected events, shown in Fig. 2. The distributions are very narrow in the transverse plane (sub-millimetre, including contributions from detector resolution and residual misalignment), of about the expected size in the longitudinal direction and well positioned with respect to the nominal centre of the ALICE detector. This provided immediate evidence that a substantial fraction of the events corresponded to collisions between the protons of the two counter-rotating beams.",

It covers the pseudorapidity ranges |\u03b7| < 2 and |\u03b7| < 1.4 for the inner and outer layers respectively, for particles originating at the centre of the detector.

Each chip contains 8192 channels and also provides a fast trigger signal if at least one of its pixels is hit. The trigger signals from all 1200 chips are then combined in a programmable logic unit which provides a level-0 trigger signal to the central trigger processor. The total thickness of the SPD amounts to about 2.3% of a radiation length. About 83% of the channels were operational for particle detection and 77% of the chips were used in the trigger logic. The SPD was aligned using cosmic-ray tracks collected during 2008 [31], and the residual misalignment was estimated to be below 10 \u00b5m for the modules well covered by mostly vertical tracks.

The achieved resolution depends on the track multiplicity and for this specific vertex reconstruction is approximately 0.1-0.3 mm in the longitudinal direction and 0.2-0.5 mm in the transverse direction. For events with only one charged track, the vertex position is determined by intersecting the SPD tracklet with the mean beam axis determined from the vertex positions of other events in the sample. A vertex was reconstructed in 94% of the selected events. The distribution of the vertex position in the longitudinal direction (z-axis) is shown in Fig. 4. For events originating from the centre of the detector, the vertex-reconstruction efficiency was estimated, using Monte Carlo simulations, to be 84% for INEL interactions and 92% for NSD collisions. These efficiencies decrease for larger |z|-values of the vertex in low-multiplicity events; therefore, only events with vertices within |z| < 10 cm were used. This allows for an accurate charged-particle density measurement in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.6 using both SPD layers. Using the reconstructed vertex as the origin, we calculate the differences in azimuthal ( \u03d5, bending plane) and polar ( \u03b8 , non-bending direction) angles of pairs of hits with one hit in each SPD layer. These tracklets [37] are selected by a cut on the sum of the squares of \u03d5 and \u03b8 , each normalized to its estimated resolution (80 mrad and 25 mrad, respectively). When more than one hit in a layer matches a hit in the other layer, only the hit combination with the smallest angular difference is used. This occurs in only 2% of the matched hits.",

In addition, the timing information from the VZERO detector was used for background rejection by removing events with negative arrival time (see Fig. 3). The event quality and event classification was crosschecked by a visual scan of the whole event sample. In total 29 events (i.e. about 10%) were rejected as beam induced background, which is consistent with the rate expected from previous fills. The remaining background was estimated from the vertex distribution and found to be negligible. The contamination from coincidence with a cosmic event was estimated to be one event in the full sample. Indeed, two cosmic events were identified by scanning, both without reconstructed vertex.",

The vertexfinding efficiency for events with one charged particle in the acceptance is about 80%. The number of zero-track events has been estimated by Monte Carlo calculations. The total number of collisions used for the normalization was calculated from the number of events selected for the analysis, corrected for the vertex-reconstruction inefficiency. In order to obtain the normalization for INEL and NSD events, we further corrected the number of selected events for the trigger efficiency for these two event classes. In addition, for NSD events, we subtract the single-diffractive contribution. These corrections, as well as those for the vertex finding efficiency, depend on the event charged-particle multiplicity, see Fig. 5. The dependence of the event-finding efficiency (combining event selection and vertex finding) on multiplicity was calculated for different interaction types using our detector simulation, and is above 98% for events with at least two charged particles. The averaged combined corrections for the vertex reconstruction efficiency and the selection efficiency is 20% for INEL interactions and much smaller for NSD interactions, due to the cancelation of some contributions.",

At this stage, we have assigned a conservative value of 4% to this uncertainty.

Our conclusion is that the total systematic uncertainty on the pseudorapidity density is less than \u00b17.2% for INEL collisions and \u00b17.1% for NSD collisions. The largest contribution comes from uncertainties in cross sections of diffractive processes and their kinematic simulation. More details about this analysis, corrections, and the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties can be found in [41]. Figure 6 shows the charged primary particle pseudorapidity density distributions obtained for INEL and NSD interactions in the range |\u03b7| < 1.6. The pseudorapidity density obtained in the central region |\u03b7| < 0.5 for INEL interactions is 3.10 \u00b1 0.13(stat.) \u00b1 0.22(syst.) and for NSD interactions is 3.51 \u00b1 0.15(stat.) \u00b1 0.25(syst.). Also shown in Fig. 6 are the previous measurements of proton-antiproton interactions from the UA5 experiment [3]. Our results obtained for proton-proton interactions are consistent with those for proton-antiproton interactions, as expected from the fact that the predicted difference (0.1-0.2%) is well below measurement uncertainties. The measurements at central pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.5) are summarized in Table 2 together with model predictions obtained with QGSM, PHO- JET and three different PYTHIA tunes. PYTHIA 6.4.14, tune D6T, and PHOJET yield respectively the lowest and highest charged particle densities. Therefore, these two have been used for the evaluation of our systematic errors. PYTHIA 6.4.20, tunes ATLAS CSC and Perugia-0, are candidates for use by the LHC experiments at higher LHC energies and are shown for comparison. Figure 7 shows the centre-of-mass energy dependence of the pseudorapidity density in the central region (|\u03b7| < 0.5). The data points are obtained in the |\u03b7| < 0.5 range from this experiment and from references [3,18,19,[45][46][47][48], and are corrected for differences in pseudorapidity range where necessary, fitting the pseudorapidity distribution around \u03b7 = 0. As noted above, there is good agreement between pp and pp data at the same energy. The dashed and solid lines (for INEL and NSD interactions respectively) are obtained by fitting the density of charged particles in the central pseudorapidity rapidity region with a power-law dependence on energy.",

The results are consistent with earlier measurements of primary charged-particle production in proton-antiproton interactions at the same energy. They are also compared with model calculations.",

If one (both) incoming beam particle(s) are excited into a high-mass state, the process is called single (double) diffraction; otherwise the events are classified as nondiffractive. Particles emitted in diffractive reactions are usually found at rapidities close to that of the parent proton.3 We estimate the trigger efficiency for each class using the process-type information provided by Monte Carlo generators; the values vary by up to a factor of two between classes and are listed in Sect. 3. The relative abundance of each class is taken from published data (see text).",
