The particle identification of tracks with p T up to \u223c 2.8 GeV/c is obtained by taking advantage of STAR TOF and TPC detectors with full azimuth coverage. Correlations in \u2206\u03c6 between jets and identified hadrons are presented, and the particle ratios in different regions of azimuth are measured. Particle ratios associated with the trigger jet vs. the recoil jet, and comparisons to inclusive particle ratios can help to distinguish between jet-related (vacuum and medium-modified) and bulk-related contributions to the ratios enhancement.",

            "text": "The particles' production mechanism in heavy ion collisions has been tested with measurements of p T dependent particle ratios. The enhancement of p/\u03c0 (p/\u03c0 \u2212 ) at intermediate p T and mid-rapidity was first observed in central \u221a s NN = 130 GeV Au+Au collisions where the p (p) yield becomes comparable to the \u03c0 (\u03c0 \u2212 ) yield at p T \u223c 1.6 (2.0) GeV/c [1]. This enhancement had not been observed in peripheral and p+p collisions at a wide range of energies. The discovery was followed by further investigations by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations. The enhancement persists at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV. Measurements at PHENIX showed that the p/\u03c0 ratio increases with p T up to \u223c 3.0 GeV/c in the 0-10 % most central Au+Au collisions while it increases and saturates with a value \u223c 0.4 at p T \u223c 1.5 GeV/c in the 60 -92 % centrality [2]. The ratio of central over peripheral binary scaled p T spectra (R CP ) of protons is close to 1 in the p T range of \u223c 1.5 -4.0 GeV/c. This suggests that protons are either less suppressed than pions or that the production mechanism in central Au+Au collisions leads to more copiously produced protons than expected from fragmentation. It was argued then that a good explanation of particle production in this p T region would require more than just hydrodynamics or pQCD (fragmentation) [2].",

            "text": "The p/\u03c0 measurements were extended to a higher p T by the STAR collaboration, reaching the region where particle production is dominated by jet fragmentation (p T \u2265 6 GeV/c) [3]. The new measurements showed the complete p T neighborhood where the unexpectedly high p/\u03c0 is found. The p/\u03c0 ratio gets enhanced at intermediate p T (1.5 -4.5 GeV/c) in 0-12 % most central Au+Au collisions compared to peripheral (60-80%) and d+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV. The ratio peaks at \u223c 2 \u2212 3 GeV/c in central Au+Au and then decreases to approach the value measured in peripheral and d+Au collisions at about p T = 5 GeV/c. The fact that the p/\u03c0 ratio is the same at this high p T suggests that the hadron production mechanism is the same in central and peripheral collisions and that the partons fragmenting into the final state proton and pion lose the same amount of energy while passing through the medium in central Au+Au collisions. There have been attempts to explain the p/\u03c0 anomalous enhancement by coalescence or recombination models and partonic energy loss effects on the p and \u03c0 spectrum [4][5] [6]. It is argued [5] that the recombination of partons is the predominant hadron production mechanism whenever they follow a thermal distribution. Fragmentation becomes the dominant mechanism once the parton distribution becomes a power law. The recombination model correctly predicted a decrease of p/\u03c0 ratio at p T \u223c 4-5 GeV/c and saturation afterwards once the fragmentation processes take over [7]. A very similar coalescence model [4] proposes coalescence of minijet partons with thermal quarks as the source of the p/\u03c0 enhancement. Thep/\u03c0 \u2212 ratio in central \u221a s NN = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions is well described up to p T = 4.0",

The same coalescence model predicted an increase (decrease) of p/\u03c0 (p/\u03c0 \u2212 ) at intermediate p T when going from 200 to 62 GeV [8]. STAR measurements confirmed the general predictions of these two models but showed some quantitative disagreement between models and data [9]. Another suggested explanation of the p/\u03c0 enhancement places its origin on the effect of parton energy loss on the hard component of particle spectrum of Au+Au collisions. The measured spectra are described by a soft (scaling with number of participant pairs) + a hard (scaling with number of binary collisions) components. The hard part is isolated and its modification with respect to N bin scaling is related to a negative boost in the hard component hadrons' p T . The modification of the hard component shows up as an increase of protons in the p T region of p/\u03c0 enhancement [6] We propose to improve our understanding of the production mechanism giving rise to the p/\u03c0 enhancement by studying this ratio in a vacuum fragmenting jet and a medium traversing one. This will allow us to look for medium modification effects on the p/\u03c0 ratio. We will study 0-20 % most central Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV and compare the particle production in the direction of a surface bias (near side) jet and its recoiling partner (away side) in the p T region where the p/\u03c0 ratio peaks.",

It has charged and neutral particle detection capabilities with full azimuth and pseudorapidity coverage of approximately +-1.5 units around mid-rapidity. The charged particles' momenta are reconstructed using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The TPC measures the P10 gas (10% methane, 90% argon) ionization energy loss by particles coming out of the collision. The energy lost is compared to the Bichsel expectation value for particle identification (PID) purposes [10]. Gammas and \u03c0 0 's are detected via the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) which is composed of 4800 towers of size 0.05 x 0.05 in \u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03c6. Each tower is made of alternating lead and scintillator material that is used to measure the transverse energy deposition through radiation [11]. Any track pointing toward a tower can induce radiation energy; therefore, the total momentum of matching tracks (or total energy if the track corresponds to an electron) is subtracted to avoid double counting. The Time of Flight detector had complete azimuth coverage starting on the Run 10 of STAR [12]. Along with the TPC it allows better PID in the region of overlap of the dE/dx expected values for kaon, protons and pions (0.7 -4.0 GeV/c).",

A simple ratio of correlation shapes already shows a smaller p/\u03c0 ratio in the trigger jet axis azimuth direction and its recoiling side as seen in figure 1. We extract the near and away side particle yields from the \u2206\u03c6 correlation by fitting it with a model that includes contributions from near and away side jet Gaussians and a constant background. The fit model used is f (\u2206\u03c6) = B + A near exp(\u22120.5(\u2206\u03c6/\u03c3 near ) 2 ) + A away exp(\u22120.5((\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0)/\u03c3 away ) 2 ). An attempt to include an azimuth quadrupole component in the model did not improve the fit and gave a proton \u03bd 2 consistent with zero and a pion \u03bd 2 = 0.031 \u00b1 0.015 (assuming that \u03bd hadrons 2 \u223c \u03bd jet 2 above 2.0 GeV/c). The small values of the quadrupoles might not be surprising given the high p jet",

The near side p/\u03c0 ratio is significantly lower than the bulk ratio reflecting a near side jet property. The away side p/\u03c0 ratio is larger than the near side and seems smaller than the bulk ratio. This result raises the question whether this is an away side -medium interaction effect. A definite conclusion awaits results of peripheral Au+Au collisions and p+p collisions and a full assessment of systematic uncertainties, both in progress.",
