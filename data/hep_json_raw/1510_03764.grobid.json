This vertex can be described by the complex parameters of an effective Lagrangian. An analysis of angular distributions of the decay products of single top quarks produced in the t-channel constrains these parameters simultaneously. The analysis described in this paper uses 4.6 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Two parameters are measured simultaneously in this analysis. The fraction f 1 of decays containing transversely polarised W bosons is measured to be 0.37 \u00b1 0.07 (stat.\u2295syst.). The phase \u03b4 \u2212 between amplitudes for transversely and longitudinally polarised W bosons recoiling against lefthanded b-quarks is measured to be \u22120.014\u03c0 \u00b1 0.036\u03c0 (stat.\u2295syst.). The correlation in the measurement of these parameters is 0.15. These values result in two-dimensional limits at the 95% confidence level on the ratio of the complex coupling parameters",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle, making the measurement of its production and decay kinematics a unique probe of physical processes beyond the Standard Model (SM). The top quark was first observed in 1995 at the Tevatron [1,2] through its dominant production channel, top-quark pair (tt) production via the flavour-conserving strong interaction. An alternative process produces single top quarks through the weak interaction, first observed at the Tevatron in 2009 [3,4]. The t-channel exchange of a virtual W boson is the dominant process contributing to single top-quark production (see figure 1). The production cross-section is calculated for -1 -JHEP04(2016)023  proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV using a next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD prediction with resummed next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, referred to as approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). With a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV and MSTW2008NNLO [5] parton distribution function (PDF) sets, the cross-section for the t-channel process is calculated to be 64.6 +2.6 \u22121.7 pb [6]. The uncertainties correspond to the sum in quadrature of the error obtained from the MSTW PDF set at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) and the factorisation and renormalisation scale uncertainties.",

These result in very tight constraints on V R and g L , but much looser constraints on g R . Calculations of the anomalous couplings in specific models predict a much larger contribution to g R than to V R or g L [14]. However, within the models studied so far for tensor couplings, the magnitude of g R is expected to be < 0.01 [14,15]. Measurements of the W boson polarisation fractions [16][17][18][19] are sensitive to the magnitude of combinations of anomalous couplings. In order to obtain constraints on Re [g R ] in those measurements, the anomalous couplings are taken to be purely real, V R = g L = 0 is assumed and V L is fixed to 1. In this analysis, the anomalous couplings V L and g R are allowed to be complex, and the ratios Re [g R /V L ] and Im [g R /V L ] are measured.",

Thus \u03b4 + cannot be constrained and f + 0 cannot be separated from P . Constraints on f + 1 are currently better determined from limits on F R [17,18]. The variations that the parameters f 1 and \u03b4 \u2212 induce in the model are demonstrated in figure 3 for t-channel signal events generated with Protos. For regions of the parameter space (f 1 , \u03b4 \u2212 ) close to the SM, only these parameters can be significantly constrained. The dependence of \u03b4 \u2212 on V R and g L is suppressed by x b , while both f 1 and \u03b4 \u2212 are dependent on V L and g R directly or through x W . Thus, to simplify the analysis, only variations in V L and g R are considered, while V R and g L are assumed to be zero. With this assumption, the values of f + 1 and f + 0 are very small. The value of P is also determined from the values of V L and JHEP04(2016)023   g R . The highest-order dependence of f 1 and \u03b4 \u2212 on the couplings V L and g R appear as the ratio g R V L , where the real and imaginary parts of this ratio are measured separately. This motivates quoting the results in both the parameter space (f 1 , \u03b4 \u2212 ) and the coupling space",

The missing transverse momentum vector, with magnitude E miss T , is used to represent the transverse component of the neutrino momentum and the longitudinal component p z \u03bd is chosen such that the resulting W boson is on its mass shell. A quadratic expression is found for p z \u03bd . If there are two possible real values, the value closer to zero is taken. If the solutions are complex, the assumption that the neutrino is the only contributor to the E miss T is not valid. Therefore, the E miss T is rescaled, preserving its direction, in order to have physical (real) solutions for p z \u03bd . If two solutions for E miss T are found, the one resulting in the smaller value of |p z \u03bd | is taken.

Also, the production of a W boson with two jets, where one is identified as containing a b-hadron, can mimic the t-channel final state. Multijet production via the strong interaction can enter the signal region as well, and data-driven techniques are required to accurately model it, as explained at the end of this section.

            "text": "Multijet background events pass the signal region selection if a jet is mis-identified as an isolated lepton or if the event has a non-prompt lepton from the decay of a hadron that appears to be isolated. Since it is neither possible to simulate a sufficient number of those events nor to calculate the rate precisely, dedicated techniques are used to model multijet events and to estimate their production rate, employing both collision data and simulated events. In the electron channel, mis-identified jets are the main source of multijet background events. This is modelled by the jet-lepton method [46], in which an electron-like jet is selected in Pythia di-jet MC with special requirements and redefined as a lepton. In the muon channel, a data-driven matrix method [46,61] based on the muon impact parameter significance is used. An uncertainty of 50% is assigned to the estimated yield based on comparisons of the rates obtained by using alternative methods [46], i.e. the matrix method in the electron channel and the jet-lepton method in the muon channel, and using an alternative variable, i.e. m T ( , E miss T ) instead of E miss T . Table 1 provides the event yields for the electron and muon channels after the event selection. The predictions are normalised to 4.6 fb \u22121 and their uncertainties are derived taking into account the statistical uncertainties of the simulated samples. For the multijet background, the uncertainties on the prediction are the statistical uncertainties of the data and simulated samples of the muon and electron channel, respectively. Figure 4 shows the angular distributions cos \u03b8 * and \u03c6 * after the event selection for the electron and muon channels in data, compared to predictions using SM couplings. The uncertainties are derived taking into account the statistical uncertainties of the data samples for data and simulated samples on the prediction and the 50% systematic uncertainty on the normalisation of the multijet background. Since the number of events in W +light-jets and multijet samples are low, statistical fluctuations and events with large generator weights affect the sample shapes. Therefore, shape templates from events selected without the b-tagging requirement are used for these two backgrounds to smooth the simulated models. In these events, the hardest jet in the event is chosen to take the place of the b-tagged-like jet for the purposes of the event selection and reconstruction. Overall, good agreement between the observed and expected distributions is found.",

The background statistical uncertainty dominates the total \"MC statistics\" uncertainty listed in table 2.

For the background model, constructed from the sum of all predicted backgrounds with an appreciable effect on the distribution, this includes events containing top quarks, primarily from tt production, the distribution of which is affected by changing the values of the couplings V L and g R . The efficiency and resolution models are averages over all unmeasured distributions in the signal. Variations in the values of V L and g R alter those unmeasured distributions, which could lead to a dependence on these couplings for the efficiency and resolution models. For instance, t-channel single top-quark production depends on anomalous coupling in both the top-quark production and decay vertices, so varying the couplings alters production-side distributions, such as the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the top or spectator quark.",

The t-channel signal and tt background events are generated with Protos for both the input MC events and the events used to derive the models. The results of these closure tests can then be compared to the values with which the input events were generated; any trend connecting them other than a line with a slope of one and an intercept of zero indicates a dependence which could bias the measurement. The results of these tests, shown in figure 7, indicate biases in the extracted parameters.",

This is achieved by deriving these models from t-channel signal MC events representing each point in (f 1 , \u03b4 \u2212 ) independently, and calculating the likelihood using the same f 1 and \u03b4 \u2212 in the signal model and in the t-channel signal MC events. The results of these tests, shown in figure 8, indicate that this procedure eliminates the biases shown in figure 7. This procedure for deriving the efficiency, resolution, and background models is used in the measurement. The dashed line with a slope of one and intercept of zero, representing no bias in the measurement, is added to guide the eye. A non-negligible bias is evident, and is represented at the lowest reasonable order with a polynomial fit. For \u03b4 \u2212 a linear fit is sufficient, while for f 1 a quadratic fit gives a better description. The dashed line with a slope of one and intercept of zero, representing no bias in the measurement, is added to guide the eye. All estimates are consistent with this line; linear fits produce a slope consistent with one and an intercept consistent with zero.",
