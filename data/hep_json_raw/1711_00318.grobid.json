The main topic of this contribution are preliminary results for mean negatively charged pion multiplicities \u03c0 \u2212 from central Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions. The data were taken recently by the NA61/SHINE collaboration for a wide range of beam momenta. Measured rapidity distributions dn dy were extrapolated to unmeasured regions to obtain total multiplicities \u03c0 \u2212 . A new scheme to calculate the mean number of wounded nucleons W utilizing the EPOS MC model is described. Using data from other experiments, a comparison of \u03c0 W for different collisions and beam momenta is discussed.",

In order to correct for trigger and reconstruction inefficiencies, one needs to apply a Monte Carlo correction. To this end, the EPOS MC [3] is used in NA61/SHINE. A large statistics of ion collisions is generated and particles are accumulated in bins n i, j gen in transverse momentum p T versus rapidity y. The generated data undergo the regular reconstruction procedure. Selecting negatively charged pions results in the distribution n i, j sel . The correction factor c i, j is then calculated as the ratio of the two Monte-Carlo generated spectra c i, j = n i, j gen /n i, j sel . The final experimental spectra are obtained as n i, j = n i, j data c i, j . In order to estimate the mean \u03c0 \u2212 multiplicity in the full acceptance, one needs to extrapolate the experimental data to unmeasured regions. The extrapolation process consisted of two stepsextrapolation in transverse momentum p T for each bin of rapidity y and extrapolation of dn/dy in rapidity. For the latter a sum of two Gaussian functions was fitted, g(y) = g T (y) + g P (y), where",

Glissando provides values that are consistent with previous measurements and applicable to the wounded nucleon model [6]. EPOS, on the other hand, allows for more detailed centrality analysis and event selection. It is possible to reproduce Glauber-based W values in EPOS and they are in good agreement with Glissando as shown in Fig. 1, where both -statistical and systematic uncertainties are calculated and combined. Therefore, Glauber-based EPOS values are used in later considerations.  Figure 1. Average number of wounded nucleons W calculated by Glissando and EPOS \"a la Glauber\".",

This assumption is based on the compilation of the world data presented in [7] and the model presented therein. Where needed, the data is corrected for slight differences in beam momentum. Applying this correction one can plot the \u03c0 \u2212 / W ratios for different systems for 30A and 150A GeV/c, see Fig. 3. Comparison of the preliminary Be+Be and Ar+Sc results with those from other systems suggest a monotonic increase with W at 150A GeV/c and a constant value at 30A GeV/c. onset of deconfinement is predicted by the SMES [8] model due to the larger number of effective degrees of freedom in comparison to the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. As for the NA61 Ar+Sc, Be+Be and p+p data only the value of \u03c0 \u2212 was obtained, the multiplicities of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 are approximated by multiplying the previously isospin asymmetry corrected \u03c0 \u2212 multiplicities by a factor 3: \u03c0 = 3 \u03c0 \u2212 . This approach is motivated by the fact that the NA61/SHINE acceptance is the largest for \u03c0 \u2212 . The energy dependence of the \u03c0 / W ratio is presented in Fig. 4. The Ar+Sc results follow p+p for low energies whereas for high energies they follow Pb+Pb. No simple systematics are observed at low SPS energies. This might be caused by different physics processes and/or systematic bias in the estimate of W . Full simulation of the fragmentation process and PSD response is needed in order to reduce the latter uncertainty.",
