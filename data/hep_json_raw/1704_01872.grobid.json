            "text": "However, this identification remains in doubt. The \u03c7 c0 (2P ) is expected to decay strongly to DD in an Swave. Here and elsewhere, D refers to either D 0 or D + . The \u03c7 c0 (2P ) \u2192 DD decay mode is expected to be dominant, but has not yet been observed experimentally for the X(3915); in contrast, the decay mode that is observed, X(3915) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9, would be OZI (Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka) [7] suppressed for the \u03c7 c0 (2P ). Since the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) should decay to DD in an S-wave, this state is na\u00efvely expected to have a large width of \u0393 > \u223c 100 MeV [8]; however, the measured X(3915) width of (20 \u00b1 5) MeV is much smaller. We note that there are some specific predictions for the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) width that give small values. For example, the predicted width is 30 MeV in Ref. [9] and between 12 and \u223c100 MeV, depending on the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) mass, in Ref. [10]. If the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) and X(3915) are the same state, then the partial width to J/\u03c8\u03c9, which has been estimated to be \u0393(\u03c7 c0 (2P ) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9) > \u223c 1 MeV [8], is too large. Also, in this case, one can obtain contradictory estimates for the branching fraction B(\u03c7 c0 (2P ) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9) [11]. Furthermore, the \u03c7 c2 (2P ) \u2212 \u03c7 c0 (2P ) mass splitting would be much smaller than the prediction of potential models and smaller than the mass difference for the bottomonium states \u03c7 bJ (2P ) [8,11], which is inconsistent with expectations based on the heavier bottom quark mass.",

An alternative fit to Belle and BABAR data was performed in Ref. [8]. In this fit, the nonresonant \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 DD events are attributed to a wide charmonium state with mass and width M = (3838\u00b112) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (211\u00b119) MeV. However, in this estimate, additional signal sources such as feed-down from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 DD * events were not taken into account; consequently, if the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) is really observed in the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 DD, then the parameters measured in Ref.

The analysis is performed using the 980 fb \u22121 data sample collected by the Belle detector at the asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider KEKB [21]. The data sample was collected at or near the \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), \u03a5(3S), \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances. The integrated luminosity is 1.4 times greater than the luminosity used in the previous analysis [20]. In addition, we use a multivariate method to improve the discrimination of the signal and background events and an amplitude analysis to study the J P C quantum numbers of the DD system.",

An iron fluxreturn located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [22]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm beampipe and a three-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 156 fb \u22121 , while a 1.5 cm beampipe, a four-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining data [23].",

            "text": "The result of the fit to the signal events in the default model are listed in Table I for two X * quantum-number hypotheses: J P C = 0 ++ and J P C = 2 ++ . There are three solutions for the 2 ++ hypothesis; all solutions have very similar likelihood values (|\u2206(\u22122 ln L)| < 1). A significant resonance is observed for both the 0 ++ and 2 ++ hypotheses; the 0 ++ hypothesis is preferred. The significance is calculated using Wilks' theorem [39] with six and twelve degrees of freedom for the 0 ++ and 2 ++ hypotheses, respectively. The global significance calculated using the method described in Ref. [40] is 8.5\u03c3 for the 0 ++ hypothesis. Thus, we observe a new charmoniumlike state that is referred to hereinafter as the X * (3860). The projections of the fit results onto M DD and the angular variables for the case of the X * (3860) with J P C = 0 ++ are shown in Fig. 6 and the amplitudes are shown in Table II. The helicity amplitudes H 1 0 and H 0 0 almost exactly coincide (with large error). This is consistent with pure S-wave production of the X * (3860) [see Eq. (A15)]. Other known states with J P C = 0 ++ or 2 ++ may also contribute to this process. We consider the states with mass \u223c3.9 GeV/c 2 [X(3915) and \u03c7 c2 (2P )] and the states observed in double-charmonium production [X(3940) and X(4160)]. Note that the X(3940) decays to D * D [19,20] and it consequently may be observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8DD only if its quantum numbers are J P C = 2 ++ . As in Ref. [20], because of low statistics we do not consider the possibility that the X * (3860) peak is due to more than one state. We check whether the X * (3860) is compatible with the states listed above by performing a fit with Gaussian constraints to the known resonance parameters [6] on the X * mass and width. For known states with J P C = 2 ++ , the exclusion levels are calculated from MC pseudoexperiments similarly to the comparison of J P C = 0 ++ and 2 ++ hypotheses described in Sec. VI D; for 0 ++ states, the exclusion levels are calculated as \u2206(\u22122 ln L). The calculation is performed for all nonresonant amplitude models. The results are listed in Table III. The X(3915) is excluded at 3.3\u03c3 and 4.9\u03c3 in the case of J P C = 0 ++ and 2 ++ , respectively. Other known states are excluded at more than 5\u03c3. In addition, we compare the X * (3860) and the lattice prediction for the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) provided in Ref. [41]. The parameters  The comparison is performed in the same way as those for the experimentally known states with J P C = 0 ++ ; the results are shown in Table III. The difference of the X * (3860) and predicted \u03c7 c0 (2P ) parameters is at 2.7\u03c3 level. Note that the systematic errors have not been determined in Ref. [41]; thus, the actual level of disagreement should be less than 2.7\u03c3.",
