Three well established methods are used to extract the CP observables. The updated measurement of \u03b3 in the three-body D 0 Dalitz space results in \u03b3 = (57 \u00b1 16) \u2022 . When combining the observables from all B \u2192 DK studies, the best fit value for \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 180] \u2022 is \u03b3 = 67.2 \u2022 with \u03b3 \u2208 [55.1, 79.1] \u2022 at 68%CL and \u03b3 \u2208 [43.9, 89.5] \u2022 at 95%CL. This represents the most precise \u03b3 values directly measured by a single experiment. Furthermore, a new time-dependent approach using B 0 s \u2192 D \u00b1 s K \u2213 decays is used for the first time to measure CP observables and future prospects for \u03b3 at LHCb are given.",

This can be done by exploiting tree-level processes like B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 or B 0 s \u2192 D \u00b1 s K \u2213 , which are sensitive to Standard Model (SM) interactions only. In contrast, it is also possible to extract \u03b3 from loop processes such as two or three-body charmless B transitions. Potential differences in these results could indicate new physics contributions. Comparing direct measurements to indirect SM fits could also indicate tensions within the SM. Examples of two different approaches to measure \u03b3 are described in these proceedings. First the more traditional time-independent measurements already performed by the B-factories in section 2 and then a new, LHCb exclusive, time-dependent way in section 3.",

The sensitivity to \u03b3 arises from the interference of both B mesons, B  In order to resolve the B 0 s oscillations, a good time resolution is mandatory. For the analysis of B 0 s \u2192 D \u00b1 s K \u2213 decays at LHCb [17] it is determined from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The difference of the reconstructed and the true decay time is fitted with a resolution model, which is the sum of three Gaussians. To account for differences in data and simulations we scale the Gaussian's widths according to B 0 s \u2192 D s \u03c0 MC and a data sample of \"fake\" B 0 s constructed from prompt D s mesons which are combined with a random \u03c0. We assume that the differences between B 0 s \u2192 D \u00b1 s K \u2213 and the control channel B 0 s \u2192 D s \u03c0 are negligible for the relevant quantities. The resulting effective time resolution is estimated as \u03c3 t \u2248 50 fs. Another crucial part is the determination of the time acceptance, which is also obtained from MC. The invariant mass distribution of the B 0 s candidates is fitted using an unbinned maximum likelihood method in order to get weights, which separate signal from background components.
