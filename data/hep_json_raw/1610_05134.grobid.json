The search is done with a detector consisting of a ton of Gd-loaded liquid scintillator in a tendon gallery approximately 24 m from the reactor core. The measured antineutrino event rate is 1976 per day with a signal to background ratio of about 22. The shape of the antineutrino energy spectrum obtained from the eight-month data-taking period is compared with a hypothesis of oscillations due to activesterile antineutrino mixing. No strong evidence of 3+1 neutrino oscillation is found. An excess around the 5 MeV prompt energy range is observed as seen in existing longer-baseline experiments. The mixing parameter sin 2 2\u03b814 is limited up to less than 0.1 for \u2206m 2 41 ranging from 0.2 to 2.3 eV 2 with a 90% confidence level.",

An apparent \u03bd e disappearance over a baseline of a few meters in the GALLEX and SAGE gallium experiments exposed to radioactive sources was reported [9]; the ratio of the numbers of measured and predicted events is 0.88 \u00b1 0.05. A number of short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments established limits on the presence of neutrino oscillations with eV mass differences by shape analyses of the measured neutrino energy spectra. Among those experiments, the Bugey experimental limits on sterile neutrinos are the most stringent [10]. Mueller et al. [11] found about a 6% deficit in reactor antineutrino event rates compared with the theoretical expectations for the short-baseline reactor experiments, which is the so-called \"reactor antineutrino anomaly\" (RAA). It can be interpreted as an active-sterile neutrino oscillation with three active neutrinos plus one or more sterile neutrinos, i.e., a 3 + n \u03bd scenario [12,13], compatible with the LSND result. Recent reactor experiments that measured the \u03b8 13 mixing angle, Daya Bay [14], RENO [15], and Double Chooz [16], all confirmed a similar deficit in the measured neutrino event rates. It is also intriguing that these three experiments observed a significant event excess beyond expectations from existing reactor-flux models [13,17,18] at prompt energies around 5 MeV.",

Considering the IBD energy spectrum, which is smoothly peaked at around 3 MeV, the sensitivity for observing an \u223c1 eV 2 mass-squared difference becomes the highest at several meters and falls off as the distance increases. The Daya Bay experiment sets limits on a light sterile neutrino with lower (i.e., < 1 eV 2 ) mass-squared differences [25]. Currently, a number of short-baseline reactor experiments are being developed [26]. Here we report results from the NEOS (neutrino experiment for oscillation at short baseline) experiment for a light sterile neutrino search at a distance of 24 m from a reactor core.",

The excess does not completely disappear even when the data are divided by S 3\u03bd dyb , as shown in Fig. 3(c). This can be explained as that the excess can be contributed differently from each fission element [33]. It is, however, difficult to conclude with the current level of uncertainties. Another large discrepancy other than the 5 MeV excess for the S 3\u03bd hmv case is found at the lowest energy range. The disagreement is as large as 8% at 1 MeV and drops rapidly as the energy increases. For the incident antineutrino flux below 2 MeV and above 8 MeV, where tabulated data do not exist, we used the exponential functions in Refs. [11,33] for an extrapolation. For the comparison with S dyb , the fluctuation shown in the lowest energy range is mainly due to the convolution of the spectrum from the original one with large neutrino energy bin sizes to one with finer prompt energy bin sizes for this work. Other small fluctuations at several energies also seem to have some small structures which are common for both reference spectra but, regarding the uncertainties, are not so significant.",

[12]. The mixing angle parameter sin 2 2\u03b8 14 is excluded for the region significantly less than 0.1 for the 0.2 eV 2 < \u2206m 2 41 < 2.3 eV 2 range. Our limits are compatible with the Bugey-3 result at the 0.2 eV 2 < \u2206m 2 41 < 4 eV 2 range, since the baselines of the two experiments are similar. The Bugey-3 and the Daya Bay are more sensitive than the NEOS at lower \u2206m 2 41 because of their spans of longer baselines. At above 4 eV 2 , our sensitivity drops as a natural consequence of shape-only analysis, while the Bugey-3 and the Daya Bay limits converge to constant sin 2 2\u03b8 14 values since the absolute rates are taken into account based on the ILL-Vogel [38,39] and Huber-Mueller flux models in their analyses, respectively. Our limit curve shows a more ragged shape than that of Bugey-3, because the differences between the data and the model spectrum are more significant by higher statistics and by use of the Daya Bay model spectrum which has smaller errors around the spectral peak range. For a more practical comparison and/or combined analysis of this work with the Bugey-3 data, it would be necessary to revise the Bugey-3 data with the Daya Bay absolute spectrum, which should be more realistic for measurements using similar types of commercial reactors.",

We could set up new stringent upper limits on the \u03b8 14 mixing angle for the \u2206m 2 41 \u223c 1 eV 2 region, thanks to the high signal to background ratio, good energy resolution, and using the most realistic reference antineutrino spectrum. The results are currently limited by uncertainties in the reference spectrum of the Daya Bay and systematics of the NEOS data. The systematic uncertainties in the antineutrino spectrum will be reduced if the reference spectrum from the RENO experiment is available since it uses the same reactor complex. Other ongoing or scheduled experiments [40][41][42][43] with even shorter baselines and/or better L/E resolution are expected to improve the sensitivities. It should be remarked that, in addition to these shortbaseline sterile neutrino searches, future long-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments [44,45] aimed at the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy would require more accurate reference IBD spectra. Recently, the IceCube and MINOS experiments constrained the \u03b8 24 mixing angle forthe 3+1 \u03bd model and rejected the LSND anomaly parameter space for \u2206m 2 41 < 3 eV 2 [46,47], for which the former assumed \u03b8 14 values from the global fits [35,48] and the latter combined \u03b8 14 constraints from the Daya Bay and the Bugey-3 results [34]. Our new limit will further improve the constraints to the LSND anomaly parameter space by combining with the \u03b8 24 measurements.",
