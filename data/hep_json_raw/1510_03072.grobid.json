The measurement is performed in the dilepton decay channels (e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , and e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ). The absolute and normalized differential cross sections for tt production are measured as a function of the jet multiplicity in the event for different jet transverse momentum thresholds and the kinematic properties of the leading additional jets. The differential ttb and ttbb cross sections are presented for the first time as a function of the kinematic properties of the leading additional b jets. Furthermore, the fraction of events without additional jets above a threshold is measured as a function of the transverse momenta of the leading additional jets and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all additional jets. The data are compared and found to be consistent with predictions from several perturbative quantum chromodynamics event generators and a next-to-leading order calculation.",

            "text": "Precise measurements of tt production and decay properties [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] provide crucial information for testing the expectations of the standard model (SM) and specifically of calculations in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high-energy scales. At the energies of the CERN LHC, about half of the tt events contain jets with transverse momentum ( p T ) larger than 30 GeV that do not come from the weak decay of the tt system [5]. In this paper, these jets will be referred to as \"additional jets\" and the events as \"tt+jets\". The additional jets typically arise from initial-state QCD radiation, and their study provides an essential test of the validity and completeness of higher-order QCD calculations describing the processes leading to multijet events. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch A correct description of these events is also relevant because tt+jets processes constitute important backgrounds in the searches for new physics. These processes also constitute a challenging background in the attempt to observe the production of a Higgs boson in association with a tt pair (ttH), where the Higgs boson decays to a bottom (b) quark pair (bb), because of the much larger cross section compared to the ttH signal. Such a process has an irreducible nonresonant background from tt pair production in association with a bb pair from gluon splitting. Therefore, measurements of tt+jets and ttbb production can give important information about the main background in the search for the ttH process and provide a good test of next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculations.",

In the present analysis, the ttbb and ttb (referred to as \"ttbb (ttb)\" in the following) cross sections are measured for the first time differentially as a function of the properties of the additional jets associated with b quarks, which will hereafter be called b jets. The ttbb process corresponds to events where two additional b jets are generated in the visible phase space, while ttb represents the same physical process, where only one additional b jet is within the acceptance requirements. In cases with at least two additional jets or two b jets, the cross section is also measured as a function of the angular distance between the two jets and their dijet invariant mass. The results are reported both in the visible phase space and extrapolated to the full phase space of the tt system to facilitate the comparison with theoretical calculations.",

These samples are produced to determine the systematic uncertainties in the measurement owing to the theoretical assumptions on the modelling of tt events, as well as for comparisons with the measured distributions. The nominal values of \u03bc R and \u03bc F are defined by the Q 2 scale in the event: \u03bc 2 R = \u03bc 2 F = Q 2 = m 2 t + p 2 T (jet), where the sum runs over all the additional jets in the event not coming from the tt decay. The samples with the varied scales use \u03bc 2 R = \u03bc 2 F = 4Q 2 and Q 2 /4, respectively. For the nominal MadGraph sample, a jet-parton matching scale of 40 GeV is chosen, while for the varied samples, values of 60 and 30 GeV are employed, respectively. These scales correspond to jet-parton matching thresholds of 20 GeV for the nominal sample, and 40 and 10 GeV for the varied ones.",

The powheg generator simulates calculations of tt production to full NLO accuracy, and is matched with two parton shower MC generators: the pythia (v. 6.426) Z2* tune (designated as pythia6 in the following), and the herwig [18] (v. 6.520) AUET2 tune [26] (referred to as herwig6 in the following).

The mc@nlo generator implements the hard matrix element to full NLO accuracy, matched with herwig (v. 6.520) for the initial-and final-state parton showers using the default tune. These two generators, powheg and mc@nlo, are formally equivalent up to the NLO accuracy, but they differ in the techniques used to avoid double counting of radiative corrections that may arise from interfacing with the parton showering generators.",

In this method the following constraints are imposed: / E T is assumed to originate solely from the two neutrinos; the W boson invariant mass is fixed to 80.4 GeV [62]; and the top quark and antiquark masses are fixed to a value of 172.5 GeV. Each pair of jets and lepton-jet combination fulfilling the selection criteria is considered in the kinematic reconstruction. Effects of detector resolution are accounted for by randomly smearing the measured energies and directions of the reconstructed lepton and b jet candidates by their resolutions. These are determined from the simulation of signal events by comparing the reconstructed b jets and leptons matched to the generated b quarks and leptons from top quark decays. For a given smearing, the solution of the equations for the neutrino momenta yielding the smallest invariant mass of the tt system is chosen. For each solution, a weight is calculated based on the expected invariant mass spectrum of the lepton and b jet from the top quark decays at the parton level. The weights are summed over 100 randomly smeared reconstruction attempts, and the kinematics of the top quark and antiquark are calculated as a weighted average. Finally, the two jets and lepton-jet combinations that yield the maximum sum of weights are chosen for further analysis. Combinations with two b-tagged jets are chosen over those with a single b-tagged jet. The efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction, defined as the number of events with a solution divided by the total number of selected tt+jets events, is approximately 94 %. The efficiency in simulation is similar to the one in data for all jet multiplicities. Events with no valid solution for the neutrino momenta are excluded from further analysis. In events with additional jets, the algorithm correctly identifies the two jets coming from the tt decay in about 70 % of the cases.",

This method is optimized for ttbb topologies in the dilepton final state of the tt system. The BDT is set up using the TMVA package [64]. To avoid any dependence on the kinematics of the additional jets, and especially on the invariant mass of the two additional jets, the method identifies the jets stemming from the tt system by making use of properties of the tt system that are expected to be mostly insensitive to the additional radiation. The variables combine information from the two final-state leptons, the jets, and / E T . All possible pairs of reconstructed jets in an event are considered. For each pair, one jet is assigned to the    T ; and the difference between the invariant mass of the two b jets and two leptons and the invariant mass of the bb pair, m bb + \u2212 \u2212 m bb . The complete list of variables can be found in Appendix A. The main challenge with this method is the large number of possible jet assignments, given four genuine b jets and potential extra jets from additional radiation in each event. The basic methodology is to use the BDT discriminant value of each dijet combination as a measure of the probability that the combination stems from the tt system. The jets from the tt system are then identified as the pair with the highest BDT discriminant. From the remaining jets, Events / 0.4 (   The BDT training is performed on a large and statistically independent sample of simulated ttH events with the Higgs boson mass varied over the range 110-140 GeV. The ttbb events are not included in the training to avoid the risk of overtraining owing to the limited number of events in the available simulated samples. The simulated ttH (bb) sample is suited for this purpose since the four b jets from the decay of the tt system and the Higgs boson have similar kinematic distributions. Since it is significantly harder to identify the jets from the tt system in ttH events than in ttbb events, where the additional b jets arise from initial-or final-state radiation, a good BDT performance with ttH events implies also a good identification in ttbb events. The distributions of the BDT discriminant in data and simulation are shown in Fig. 4 for all dijet combinations in an event, and for the combination with the highest weight that is assigned to the tt system. The subset \"Minor bkg.\" includes all non-tt processes and tt+Z/W/\u03b3 events. There is good agreement between the data and simulation distributions within the statistical uncertainties.",

The ttbb and ttb processes are combined into a single template because they only differ by the kinematic properties of the second additional b jet. Details about the definition of the b jets and the acceptance are given in Sect. 7. The second template includes the background contribution coming from ttcc and tt+light-jets events (referred to as \"tt other\"), where ttcc events are defined as those that have at least one c jet within the acceptance and no additional b jets. This contribution is not large enough to be constrained by data, therefore it is combined with the tt+light-jets process in a single template. The third template contains the remaining background processes, including tt2b, which corresponds to events with two additional b hadrons that are close enough in direction to produce a single b jet. This process, produced by collinear g \u2192 bb splitting, is treated separately owing to the large theoretical uncertainty in its cross section and insufficient statistical precision to constrain it with data. The normalizations of the first two templates are free parameters in the fit. The third is fixed to the corresponding cross section described in Sect. 3, except for the cross section for the tt2b process, which is corrected by a factor of 1.74 +0.69 \u22120.74 [65]. The normalization factors obtained for the template fit correspond to 1.66 \u00b1 0.43 (tt+HF) and 1.00 \u00b1 0.01 (tt other).

The dominant contribution arises from the ttbb process. The tt decays into \u03c4 leptons decaying leptonically are included as signal to increase the number of ttb and ttbb events both in data and simulation. It has been checked that the distribution of the variables of relevance for this analysis do not differ between the leptons directly produced from W boson decays and the leptons from \u03c4 decays within the statistical uncertainties in the selected ttb and ttbb events. In general, the variables presented are well described by the simulation, after correcting for the heavy-flavour content measured in data, although the simulation tends to predict smaller values of \u0394R bb than the data. After the full selection, the dominant background contribution arises from dilepton tt events with additional light-quark, gluon, and c jets, corresponding to about 50 and 20 % of the total expected yields for the ttb and ttbb cases, respectively.

The uncertainty in the modelling of the hard-production process is assessed by varying the common renormalization and factorization scale in the MadGraph signal samples up and down by a factor of two with respect to its nominal value of the Q in the event (cf. Sect. 3). Furthermore, the effect of additional jet production in MadGraph is studied by varying up and down by a factor of two the threshold between jet production at the matrix element level and via parton showering. The uncertainties from ambiguities in modelling colour reconnection (CR) effects are estimated by comparing simulations of an underlying-event (UE) tune including colour reconnection to a tune without it (Perugia 2011 and Perugia 2011 noCR tunes, described in Ref. [33]). The modelling of the UE is evaluated by comparing two different Perugia 11 (P11) pythia tunes, mpiHi and TeV, to the standard P11 tune. The dependency of the measurement on the top quark mass is obtained using dedicated samples in which the mass is varied by \u00b11 GeV with respect to the default value used in the simulation. The uncertainty from parton shower modelling is determined by comparing two samples simulated with powheg and mc@nlo, using either pythia or herwig for the simulation of the parton shower, underlying event, and hadronization. The effect of the uncertainty in the PDFs on the measurement is assessed by reweighting the sample of simulated tt signal events according to the 52 CT10 error PDF sets, at the 90 % CL [25].",

For the ttb and ttbb cross sections, the total uncertainty, including all systematic uncertainties, is only about 10 % larger than the statistical uncertainty. The experimental uncertainties with an impact on the normalization of the expected number of signal events, such as lepton and trigger efficiencies, have a negligible effect on the final cross section determination, since the normalization of the different processes is effectively constrained by the template fit.",

The response matrix A i j that corrects for migrations and efficiencies is calculated from simulated tt events using MadGraph. The generalized inverse of the response matrix is used to obtain the unfolded distribution from the measured distribution by applying a \u03c7 2 technique. To avoid nonphysical fluctuations, a smoothing prescription (regularization) is applied. The regularization level is determined individually for each distribution using the averaged global correlation method [70]. To keep the bin-to-bin migrations small, the width of bins in the measurements are chosen according to their purity and stability. The purity is the number of events generated and correctly reconstructed in a certain bin divided by the total number of reconstructed events in the same bin. The stability is the ratio of the number of events generated and reconstructed in a bin to the total number of events generated in that bin. The purity and stability of the bins are typically larger than 40-50 %, which ensures that the bin-to-bin migrations are small enough to perform the measurement. The performance of the unfolding procedure is tested for possible biases from the choice of the input model (the tt MadGraph simulation). It has been verified that by reweighting the tt simulation the unfolding procedure based on the nominal response matrix reproduces the altered shapes within the statistical uncertainties. In addition, tt samples simulated with powheg and mc@nlo are employed to obtain the response matrices used in the unfolding for the determination of systematic uncertainties of the model (Sect. 6.2). Therefore, possible effects from the unfolding procedure are already taken into account in the systematic uncertainties.",

The measurements are presented for two different phase-space regions, defined by the kinematic and geometric attributes of the tt decay products and the additional jets. The visible phase space is defined by the following kinematic requirements: The full phase space is defined by requiring only the additional jets or b jets be within the above-mentioned kinematic range, without additional requirements on the decay products of the tt system, and including the correction for the corresponding dileptonic branching fraction, calculated using the leptonic branching fraction of the W boson [62].",

In general, the MadGraph generator interfaced with pythia6, and powheg interfaced both with herwig6 and pythia6, provide reasonable descriptions of the data. The mc@nlo generator interfaced with her-wig6 does not generate sufficiently large jet multiplicities, especially for the lowest jet p T threshold. The sensitivity of MadGraph to scale variations is investigated through the comparison of different renormalization, factorization, and jet-parton matching scales with respect to the nominal MadGraph simulation. Variations in the jet-parton matching threshold do not yield large effects in the cross section, while the shape and normalization are more affected by the variations in the renormalization and factorization scales, which lead to a slightly worse description of the data up to high jet multiplicities, compared to their nominal values. In Fig. 8, the results are compared to the predictions from MadGraph and MG5_aMC@NLO interfaced with pythia8, and the powheg generator with the hdamp parameter set to m t = 172.5 GeV (labelled powheg (h damp = m t ) in the legend), interfaced with pythia6, pythia8, and her-wig6. The MadGraph and MG5_aMC@NLO simulations interfaced with pythia8 predict larger jet multiplicities than measured in the data for all the considered p T thresholds. In general, no large deviations between data and the different powheg predictions are observed.",

The dominant production mechanism of pp \u2192 ttbb is gluon-gluon (gg) scattering, while in the case of pp \u2192 ttjj, the quark-gluon (qg) channel is equally relevant. The |\u03b7| distributions of the additional b jets seem to be more central than the corresponding distributions of the additional jets, see Figs. 10 and 13. This difference can be attributed mainly to the contribution of the production via the qg channel, which favours the emission of jets at larger |\u03b7|. The distributions of the differential cross section as a function of m bb peak at smaller invariant masses than those as a function of m jj , presented in Figs. 11 and 14, because of the larger contribution of the gg channel. Given the large uncertainties in the ttbb measurements, no statistically significant differences can be observed in the shape of the p T distributions of the additional b jets compared to the additional jets, shown in Figs. 9 and 12.",

In both cases, detector effects are unfolded using the MadGraph simulation to obtain the results at the particle level. The additional jets at the generator level are defined as all jets within the kinematic acceptance, excluding the two b jets originating from the b quarks from top quark decay (see Sect. 7). For each value of the p T and H T thresholds the gap fraction at the generator level is evaluated, along with the equivalent distributions after the detector simulation and analysis requirements. Given the high purity of the selected events, above 70 % for any bin for the leading additional jet p T and H T , and above 85 % for any bin for the subleading additional jets, a correction for detector effects is applied by following a simpler approach than the unfolding method used for other measurements presented here. The data are corrected to the particle level by applying the ratio of the generated distributions at particle level to the simulated ones at the reconstruction level, using the nominal MadGraph simulation. The measured gap fraction distributions are compared to predictions from MadGraph interfaced with pythia6, powheg6 interfaced with pythia6 and herwig6, mc@nlo interfaced with herwig6, and to the MadGraph predictions with varied renormalization, factorization, and jet-parton matching scales. Figure 19 displays the gap fraction distribution as a function of the p T of the leading and subleading additional jets, and H T . The lower part of the figures shows the ratio of the predictions to the data. The light band indicates the total uncertainty in the data in each bin. The threshold, defined at the value where the data point is shown, is varied from 25 GeV (lower value compared to previous measurements [5]) to 190 GeV. In general, MadGraph interfaced with pythia6 agrees with the data distributions of the three variables, while powheg interfaced with pythia6 and herwig6 also provide a good description of the data, though they tend to predict a lower gap fraction than the measured ones. The mc@nlo generator interfaced with herwig6 describes the data well as a function of the leading additional jet p T . However, it predicts higher values of the gap fraction as a function of the subleading jet p T and H T . Modifying the renormalization and factorization scales in Mad-Graph worsens the agreement with data, while variations of the jet-parton matching threshold provide similar predictions as the nominal MadGraph simulation, in agreement with the results shown before.",
