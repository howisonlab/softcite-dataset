The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 36 fb \u22121 . No significant deviation from the standard model is observed. Limits are set at 95% confidence level on energy scales for two general classes of nonresonant models. For a class of fermion contact interaction models, lower limits ranging from 20 to 32 TeV are set on the characteristic compositeness scale \u039b. For the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali model of large extra dimensions, the first results in the dilepton final state at 13 TeV are reported, and values of the ultraviolet cutoff parameter \u039b T below 6.9 TeV are excluded. A combination with recent CMS diphoton results improves this exclusion to \u039b T below 7.7 TeV, providing the most sensitive limits to date in nonhadronic final states.",

            "text": "Nonresonant enhancements of the production rate of high invariant mass lepton pairs in proton-proton (pp) collisions have been predicted in several models [1,2] of phenomena beyond the standard model (SM). In these models, the differential cross section for the production of charged lepton pairs can be described by the equation: 1) where m is the invariant mass of the two leptons, d\u03c3 DY /dm is the SM Drell-Yan (DY) differential cross section, \u03b7 X is a model specific form factor, and the signal contribution terms are separated into an interference term (I) and a pure signal term (S). Interference between new physical processes and the SM DY process is possible when the new process acts on the same initial state and yields the same final state. For the analysis presented in this paper we consider two nonresonant scenarios: a contact interaction arising from the existence of fermion substructure; and the effects of virtual spin-2 gravitons as predicted by models with large extra dimensions. The existence of three generations of quarks and leptons has led to speculation [1] that these particles may be composed of more fundamental constituents, which have been called \"preons\". The preons would account for the properties of quarks and leptons via a new strong gauge interaction, analogous to the color interaction in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Below a given energy scale \u039b, the main effect of this QCD-like interaction is to bind the preons into singlet states with respect to the new gauge interaction. Given the JHEP04 (2019)114present limits on the substructure of quarks and leptons, it is expected that \u039b would be on the order of at least several TeV. For parton interactions at a center-of-mass energy \u221a\u015d much lower than \u039b, the presence of preon bound states would result in a flavor-diagonal \"contact interaction\" (CI) [3]. Assuming quarks and leptons share common constituents, the Lagrangian for the CI process qq \u2192 , where is a charged lepton, can be expressed as 2) where q L = (u, d) L is a left-handed quark doublet; q R represents a sum over the righthanded quark singlets (u-and d-type); and L and R are the left-and right-handed leptons, respectively. By convention, g 2 contact /4\u03c0 = 1 and the helicity parameters \u03b7 ij are taken to have unit magnitude. The compositeness scale, represented by \u039b, is potentially different for each of the individual terms in the Lagrangian. Therefore, the individual helicity currents for \"left-left\" (LL), \"right-right\" (RR), and the combination of \"left-right\" (LR) and \"right-left\" (RL) in eq. (12), together with their scales (\u039b LL , \u039b RR , and \u039b LR ), are considered separately in this search, and in each case all other currents are assumed to be zero. The combination of LR and RL is referred to simply as LR throughout the paper. A given \u03b7 ij can be related to the form factor in the differential cross section in eq. 1.1by",

Theories extending the SM with additional dimensions have been studied extensively [4]. The model with large extra dimensions developed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) [2] describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory. It has the potential to solve, at the TeV scale, the so-called \"hierarchy problem\", which arises from the large difference between the Higgs boson mass [4] and the energy scale, referred to as the Planck mass M Pl , at which gravity is expected to become strong. This is achieved via an extension of spacetime by n additional compactified spatial dimensions of size L. In the ADD model, all SM particles are confined to the four-dimensional subspace (the brane), while gravity can propagate to all D = n + 4 dimensions (the bulk). If L is sufficiently large, the D-dimensional fundamental Planck mass M D , which is related to M Pl in three dimensions by 4) can then be probed at the TeV scale. The aforementioned compactification of the additional dimensions results in periodic boundary conditions, and thus a quasi-continuous spectrum of Kaluza-Klein graviton modes. As the interaction scale increases, more graviton modes are excited, leading the ADD model to predict a nonresonant excess of lepton pairs at high dilepton masses originating from the decay of virtual gravitons. These processes can be characterized by the single energy cutoff scale \u039b T in the Giudice-Rattazzi-Wells (GRW) convention [5], the string scale M S in the Hewett convention [6], or the number of",

A mass-dependent correction factor is applied in order to reach next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative QCD, and to account for weak effects at NLO, as well as pure quantum electrodynamics effects. This factor is derived as the ratio of the cross sections calculated by fewz 3.1b2 [27] to those calculated with powheg, using a combination of PDFs from pdf4lhc15 [28][29][30] and the lux [31] PDF set for the photon PDFs. This correction factor also accounts for photoninduced processes [32,33], stemming from \u03b3\u03b3 initial states.

The uncertainty in muon efficiency, as a function of p T and \u03b7, is determined from differences between data and simulation.

The uncertainty in the resolution is found to scale with p T . The remaining uncertainties are applicable to both the electron and muon channels. The simulated backgrounds are normalized using data at the Z boson peak, and a systematic uncertainty is assigned to cover the observed difference between data and simulation before normalization. The uncertainty in the cross section calculation of the simulated diboson and tt events is found to be a constant 7%. Uncertainty in the PDF leads to uncertainties in the simulated DY yields. The uncertainty is determined with the pdf4lhc procedure [28][29][30] using replicas of the nnpdf 3.0 PDF set [25]. Other uncertainties in the NNLO DY cross section, such as due to the scale of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , have a negligible effect on the event yields. The precision in estimating the misreconstructed jet background is limited by the amount of data at high dilepton mass, and a conservative uncertainty of 50% is assigned. The systematic uncertainty in the simulation of pileup is derived from the 5% precision on the total inelastic pp scattering cross section that is used in the procedure to reweight the simulated event samples.

The limits are more stringent for models with constructive interference than those with destructive interference. The expected limits are comparable for the electron and muon channels, which are shown separately. The observed limits are more stringent for the muon channel than for the electron channel, but are consistent within statistical fluctuation. Assuming a universal contact interaction for electrons and muons, exclusion limits can be determined for the combined data sets. These limits, shown in figure 3, range from \u039b LL > 20 TeV for destructive interference to \u039b RR > 32 TeV for constructive interference.",

Differentiating between the BB and BE pseudorapidity categories enhances the sensitivity as the signal is expected to be more central than the SM backgrounds. The most frequently studied parameter conventions, i.e., GRW, Hewett, and HLZ, have been considered. Figure 4 shows the 95% CL exclusion limits for the respective UV cutoff parameters in both the electron and muon channels. The combined 95% CL exclusion limit on the cross section in the GRW model is shown in figure 5, alongside the corresponding exclusion limits on the UV cutoff parameters. The lower limit on \u039b T at 95% confidence level is 6.9 TeV, which excludes a string scale M S below 6.1 TeV in the Hewett parameter convention. In the HLZ convention, this translates to lower limits on M S of 5.5 to 8.2 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions.",

Combining the data of the individual electron, muon, and photon channels, 95% CL exclusion limits are calculated using the Theta limitsetting framework [47]. As the scales of the interactions corresponding to the considered search regions, m \u03b3\u03b3 > 500 GeV and m > 1.8 TeV, differ substantially, the uncertainties are taken to be uncorrelated between the diphoton and dilepton analyses. To ensure a consistent interpretation of the exclusion limits in the combination of all three channels, no higher-order correction factor is assumed. Figure 6 shows the individual and combined limits, and the limits from the \u221a s = 8 TeV dilepton measurement [8] are also shown. The highest sensitivity is given by the combination of all three channels as exhibited by the expected limits. However, an underfluctuation measured in the photon channel still results in the best observed limits. A summary of the exclusion limits on the respective UV cutoff parameters is given in table 2. The lower limit on \u039b T increases to 7.7 TeV, while the limits on M S increase to 6.9 TeV in the Hewett convention and 6.1 to 9.3 TeV in the HLZ convention.",
