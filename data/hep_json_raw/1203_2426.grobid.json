            "text": "The modern theory of the strong force, which binds quarks inside hadron matter, is quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1,2]. In the QCD framework only color-singlet states can exist due to confinement, and only some combinations of color states produce an attractive potential, leading to a bound state. Therefore, the field of hadronic physics is the study of strong interaction in all visible matters and understanding of fundamental questions in terms of QCD. Recently the experimental situation in this field appeared quite exciting. Especially, the situation changed dramatically in the last ten years. After the Belle Collaboration claimed the observation of a new and narrow resonance around 3.872 GeV/c 2 , decaying into J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 + , named X(3872) [3], many similar charmonium and bottomonium states was found. Most of these states do not fit in the standard charmonium/bottomonium model. This review talk is devoted to the experimental signatures of these hadron spectroscopy, in particular, these exotic states. These results are from experiments at both e + e \u2212 and hadron colliders. Most of the new charmonium states observed in the last few years are from B factory experiments BABAR and Belle. Many new observations of hadron spectroscopy also come from the \u03c4 \u2212charm factory experiments BESIII and CLEO-c, and from hadron colliders including experiments at Tevatron and LHC, as well as fixed target experiments, such as COMPASS. The analysis techniques adopted in the search for hadron spectroscopy depend on the production mechanisms at different experiments. In the B factories at e + e \u2212 machine, the hadron can be produced in a B meson decay, e.g. B \u2192 Kh, and in the s-channel direct production, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 h or with an initial state radiation (ISR) for hadron state carrying J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , and in the two photon fusion production, as well as double quarkonium production, e.g. e + e \u2212 \u2192 (cc)(cc). At hadron collider, prompt productions coexist with the production in B meson decays. At a fixed-target experiment like COMPASS, the production mechanisms are mainly from three mechanisms: central production, diffractive dissociation and photoproduction. In this paper, for the reported experimental results, the first error and second error will be statistical and systematic, respectively, if they are not specified.",

The KLOE Collaboration performed analysis based on data sample of 1.7 fb \u22121 collected at \u221a s = 1.02 GeV in the \u03c6 meson mass region. By using the radiative decay \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7, the decay rate for the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 (\u03b3) has been firstly obtained to be BR(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 (\u03b3)) = (2.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [5]. As a result, the measured branching ratio is fully radiation inclusive. The measurement is in agreement with theoretical predictions, which are in the range (2.41 \u2212 2.67) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [6][7][8]. Figure 1 shows the mass distribution of four electrons. Precise measurements of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay rates provide important information to test the Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) [9]. The decays \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 are expected to get contributions from the box anomalies which proceed through a vector meson resonance, described by the Vector Meson Dominance (VDM) [10]. According to the effective theory the \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 processes are supposed to proceed both via a resonant contribution, mediated by the \u03c1 meson, and a non-resonant direct term, connected to the box anomaly. Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 558 fb \u22121 at \u03c6 peak, the KLOE measured the ratio of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 using the decay \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 [11]. The preliminary result is BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3) BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.1838 \u00b1 0.0005 \u00b1 0.0030.",

The rare and forbidden decays of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 could be reached at the BESIII experiment [14]. The BESIII Collaboration made a precision measurement of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0s via the decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 [15]. The branching fractions are determined to be BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (3.83 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.39) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (3.56 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.34) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . For the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the branching ratio is consistent with the CLEO-c measurement [16], and the precision is improved by a factor of four.

An important issue is about the nature of \u03b7(1405) and \u03b7(1475) states, which are not well established. By using the decays of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 in BESIII, clear f 0 (980) signals are observed on both \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 spectra as shown in Fig. 2, the width of the observed f 0 (980) is much narrower (less than 10 MeV) than that in other processes [13]. By taking events in the window of f 0 (980) on the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) mass spectrum, evidence of f 1 (1285)/\u03b7(1295) is observed in the low mass region of f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 as shown in Fig. 3  [15]. It is interesting that a clear peak around 1400 MeV is also observed on the mass of f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 (see Fig. 3). Angular analysis indicates that the peak on 1400 MeV is from \u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 decay. The BESIII Collaboration measured the product branching fraction of \u03b7(1405) production to be BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(1405)) \u00d7 BR(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 ) \u00d7 BR(f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (1.50 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22125 and BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(1405)) \u00d7 BR(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 ) \u00d7 BR(f 0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (7.10 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b1 0.72) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [15], respectively. According to PDG values [13], one obtains the ratio BR(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 )/BR(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 a 0 (980)\u03c0 0 ) \u223c 25%. It is the first time that we observe anomalously large isospin violation in the strong decay of \u03b7(1405) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 (for example, the ratio of the isospin violating \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 to the isospin covering \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 is about 0.8%). Following BESIII measurement, in reference [17], the authors interpret this puzzle as an intermediate on-shell KK * + c.c. rescattering to the isospin violating f 0 (980)\u03c0 0 by exchanging on-shell kaon. Further experimental study on the \u03b7(1405) parameters and identification of quantum number are needed at BESIII.",

The best fit to the data is obtained when the \u03c0 1 \u03c0 amplitude is included.

The \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum for events where either M (\u03b7\u03c0 + ) or M (\u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 ) is in a 100 MeV/c 2 mass window centered on the a 0 (980) mass is shown in Fig. 6 (right). Three peaks are observed on the \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, two of them in the low mass side are f 1 (1285) and \u03b7(1405). The structure near 1.8 GeV/c 2 is the first observation. A fit to the three signal peaks leads to M = 1877.3 \u00b1 6.3 +3.4 \u22127.4 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 57 \u00b1 12 +19 \u22124 MeV/c 2 for the X(1870) structure with the statistical significance of 7.2\u03c3. Here the three signal peaks are parametrized by Breit-Wigner functions convolved with a Gaussian resolution function and multiplied by an efficiency curve, which are both determined from signal MC samples and fixed in the fit. Whether the resonant structure of X(1870) is due to the X(1835), the \u03b7 2 (1870), an interference of both, or a new resonance still needs further study such as a PWA that will be possible with the larger J/\u03c8 data sample.",

With the BESIII data, a PWA analysis is performed to determine the parameters of the pp mass threshold structure, which we denote as X(pp) [31]. Only events of M pp < 2.2 GeV/c 2 are considered in the PWA. Four components, the X(pp), f 2 (1910), f 0 (2100) and 0 ++ phase space (PS) are included in the PWA fit. The intermediate resonances are described by Breit-Wigner propagators, and the parameters of the f 2 (1910) and f 0 (2100) are fixed at PDG values. In the fit, the pp final state interaction (FSI) effect is also considered by using the Julich formulation [32]. Figure 7 shows comparisons of the mass and angular distributions between the data and the PWA fit projections. In the optimal PWA fit, the X(pp) is assigned to be a 0 \u2212+ state, which is 6.8\u03c3 better than other J P C assignment. In the fit, a Breit-Wigner and S-wave final state interaction (I=0) factor can well describe the pp mass threshold structure. The PWA fits are also performed without the correction for FSI effect. The corresponding log-likelihood value worsen by 25.6 than those with FSI effect included. With the inclusion of Julich-FSI effects, the mass, width and product BR  for the X(pp) are measured to be:",

The \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c transition is also a source of information on the \u03b7 c mass and width. There is currently a 3.3\u03c3 inconsistency in previous \u03b7 c mass measurements from J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (averaging 2977.3 \u00b1 1.3 MeV/c 2 ) compared to \u03b3\u03b3 or pp production (averaging 2982.6 \u00b11.0 MeV/c 2 ) [13]. The width measurements also spread from 15 to 30 MeV, it is around 10 MeV in the earlier days of experiments using J/\u03c8 radiative transition [35,36], while the recent experiments, including photon-photon fusion and B meson decays, gave higher mass and much wider width [37][38][39][40]. The recent study by the CLEO-c experiment [41], using both \u03c8(2S) and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c decays, and pointed out there was a distortion of the \u03b7 c line shape. The CLEO-c attributed the \u03b7 c line-shape distortion to the energy-dependence of the M1 transition matrix element. In the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c from CLEO-c, the distorted \u03b7 c lineshape can be described by the relativistic Breit-Wigner (BW) distribution modified by a factor of E 3 \u03b3 together with a dumping factor to suppress the tail on the higher photon energies. The KEDR Collaboration did the same thing but tried different dumping factor [42].",

For a hindered M1 transition the matrix element acquires terms proportional to E 3 \u03b3 , which, when combined with the usual E 4 \u03b3 term accounting for the wave function mismatch between the radial excited \u03c8(2S) and the ground-state \u03b7 c (1S) transitions, lead to contributions in the radiative width proportional to E 7 \u03b3 . Thus, the \u03b7 c lineshape is described by a BW modified by E 7 \u03b3 convoluted with a resolution function. It is important to point out that the interference between \u03b7 c and non-resonance in the signal region is also considered. The statistical significance of the interference is 15\u03c3. This affects the \u03b7 c resonant parameters significantly. By assuming all non-resonant events interfere with the \u03b7 c , the BESIII analysis obtains \u03b7 c mass and width, M = 2984.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.6 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 32.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 1.0 MeV, respectively. Two solutions of relative phase are found for each decay mode, one represents constructive interference, the other for destructive. Regardless which solution one takes, the mass, width of the \u03b7 c and the overall fit are always unchanged. The relative phases for constructive interference or destructive interference from each mode are consistent with each other within 3\u03c3, which may suggest a common phase in all the modes under study. The fit with common phase for each mode shows the relative phase \u03c6 = 2.40 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b1 0.08 rad (constructive) or \u03c6 = 4.19 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.09 rad (destructive). The physics that the interference phase is the same for the six channels is yet to be understood. Figure 9 shows the fit results in the six \u03b7 c decay modes.

A bump is observed around 3635 MeV/c 2 on the mass spectrum as shown in Fig. 10.

The resonances \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 are described by the corresponding Monte Carlo (MC) shape convolved a Gaussian which takes account the small difference on the mass shift and resolution between data and MC. So the mass resolution for the \u03b7 c (2S) in the fitting is fixed to the linear extrapolation of the mass resolutions from the \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 signals in data.

            "text": "A measurement of the \u03c8(3770) meson parameters has been reported by the KEDR experiment based on data samples during the scans of the center-of-mass energy range from 3.67 to 3.92 GeV at the VEPP-4M e + e \u2212 collider in 2004 and 2006 [56]. The observed multihadron cross sections were fitted as a function of the center-of-mass energy using some assumptions about the behaviour of then non-resonant form factor. The data points corrected for the detector efficiency together with several fitting curves are shown in Fig. [? ] (left). Unlike Ref. [57], KEDR experiment did not observe any shape anomaly. The interference of resonant and nonresonant production essential in the near-threshold region has been taken into account as suggested in Ref. [58]. The analysis assumes the domination of \u03c8(2S) in the non-\u03c8(3770) part of the D-meson form factor. It is also worth noting that correct accounting of the resonance-continuum interference can help in solving the \u03c8(3770) non-DD puzzle [59].  It is known that for two interfering resonances the ambiguity can appear in the resonance amplitudes and the interference phase [60]. Figure 12 (right) shows the results of the two solutions corresponding to vector dominance models (VDM). The KEDR experiment presented the results on the mass ad width of \u03c8(3770) are M = 3779.1 +1.8 \u22121.7 \u00b1 0.6 +0.2 \u22120.3 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 25.2 +4.6 \u22124.1 \u00b1 0.5 +0.5 \u22120.2 MeV, where average values of the mass and total width of the two VDM solutions are used and the third error arises from the model dependence. The results agree with those from BABAR [61] also taking into account interference and disagree with all results obtained ignoring this effect including that by BESII [62]. The KEDR also obtained two possible solutions for the \u03c8(3770) electron partial width Most of the potential models strongly support the first solution and can barely tolerate the second one [63][64][65]. The X(3872) resonance is the forerunner of the new charmonium family. It was discovered by Belle [3] in the B \u2192 KX decay, with X \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and confirmed by BABAR [66,67], CDF [68] and D0 [69], and now by CMS [70,71] and LHCb [72]. The quantum number J P C of the X(3872) state is not yet fully established. A study of the angular decay distributions performed by the CDF experiment gave nonnegligible probabilities only for 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ [68], where C = + is also confirmed by the observation of the X \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 decay [73]. Table 2 summarizes the measurements of the X(3872) mass. The new world average is M = 3871.67 \u00b1 0.17. The close proximity of the worldaveraged mass to the D * 0D0 (m D * 0 + mD0 = 3871.79 \u00b1 0.30 MeV/c 2 ) mass threshold has engendered speculation that the X(3872) might be a loosely bound D * 0D0 molecule or a tetraquark state [74]. Despite a large experimental effort, the nature of this new state is still uncertain and several models have been proposed to describe it. With full dataset (711 fb \u22121 ) collected by the Belle detector, the difference in masses of the X(3872) states produced in B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 and B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 decays is determined to be [75]: \u2206M X(3872) = (\u22120.69 \u00b1 0.97 \u00b1 0.19) MeV/c 2 , which is consistent with zero and disagrees with theoretical predictions based on a diquark model for the X(3872) [76]. We conclude from this that the same particle is produced in the two processes and use a fit to the combined neutral and charged B meson data samples to determine: M X(3872) = (3871.84 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b1 0.19) MeV/c 2 . This result agrees with the current world-average value of 3871.67 \u00b1 0.17 MeV/c 2 as listed in Table 2. The width of the X(3872) signal peak is consistent with the experimental mass resolution and we set a 90% CL limit on its natural width of \u0393 X(3872) < 1.2 MeV, improving on the previous limit of 2.3 MeV. The details of the analysis can be found in [75]. The production ratio of X(3872) in the B 0 and B + meson decays are measured to be :",

The BaBar result for this ratio is R(X) = 0.41 \u00b1 0.24 \u00b1 0.05 [67]. Both BABAR [78] and Belle [75] experiments had searched the charged partner of the X(3872) decaying into \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 by using B \u2192 K\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 decay, and shows no evidence for a charged partner to the X(3872) decaying as X + \u2192 \u03c1 + J/\u03c8. The current data favor isospin I = 0. However, the close proximity of the D * 0D0 threshold may induce large isospin violations, as pointed out by N. A. Tornqvist [79]. Unfortunately, in Belle experiment, an attempt to discriminate between J P C = 1 ++ and 2 \u2212+ with an angular analysis of X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 didn't brought to any conclusion, due to the lack of statistics [75]. Radiative decays of the X(3872) are important in understanding its nature. The decay of X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 established its charge parity to be +1. Both BaBar [80] and Belle [73] searched for the the X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 and X(3872) \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03b3 decays, that are predicted to dominate for a molecule. The BABAR Collaboration [80] show that BR(X(3872) \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03b3) is almost three times that of BR(X(3872) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3), while, the Belle Collaboration find no evidence for X(3872) \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03b3, and determine the ratio to be : R \u2261 B(X(3872)\u2192\u03c8 \u2032 \u03b3) B(X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3) < 2.1 (at 90% C.L.) [73]. The possibility of a \u03c8(2S)\u03b3 dominance seems to be excluded. The X(3872) state may not have a large cc admixture with a D * 0 D molecular component as was expected on the basis of the BABAR result [80].",

With an integrated luminosity of 34.7 pb \u22121 collected by the LHCb experiment, the production of the X(3872) particle is observed in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV.

The Y (4260) is the first one found by BABAR Collaboration [81]. Now four states were discovered at the B-factories [81][82][83][84]: the Y (4008) and the Y (4260) decaying to J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the Y (4350) and the Y (4660) decaying to \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The Y (4260) has been also confirmed by the CLEO-c experiment [85,86] that could extensively produce it by running at open charm energy region. This allowed to observe also the Y \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and the Y \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 modes. The Belle experiment performs an analysis to compare the Y (4260) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and the Y (4260) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 rates. According to the isospin symmetry, the second one should be half of the rate of the first one. The cross-sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 as function of mass have been measured, and by fitting to the cross-sections data, they obtain \u0393 ee \u00d7 BR(Y (4260) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (3.19 +1.82+0.64 \u22121.53\u22120.35 ) eV, which is consistent with the isospin expectation by comparing to the measured \u0393 ee \u00d7 BR(Y (4260) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [13].",

The details of the analysis can be found in [92,93]. The M M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) spectrum with the combinatorial background and K s contributions subtracted, and the signal function resulting from the fit overlaid, are shown in Fig. 14  A clear two-peak structure is seen without any significant non-resonant contribution. By assuming that the spin-parity for both structures is J P = 1 + , a \u03c7 2 fit to the M M (\u03c0) distributions is performed. In the fit, two P -wave BW amplitudes and a non-resonant contribution is used. The results of the fit are shown in Fig. 15 and are summarized in Table 3. The nonresonant amplitude is found to be consistent with zero. In the fit, the hypothesis of two resonances is favored over the hypothesis of a single resonance (no resonances) at the 7.4 \u03c3 (17.9 \u03c3) level. Therefore, the two charged structures are named as Z  Results of the fits are summarized in Table 4. The combined statistical significance of the two peaks exceeds 10\u03c3 for all tested models and for all \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay modes. This \"coincidence\" can be explained by a molecular-like type of new states, i.e., their structure is determined by the strong interaction dynamics of the B * B and B * B * meson pairs [95]. The \u03a5(5S) \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays seem to be saturated by the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650) intermediate states; this decay mechanism may be responsible for the high rate of the \u03a5(5S) \u2192 h b (mP )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process measured recently by the Belle Collaboration [90].",

Especially, I gave a review of the exotic candidates ob-served so far. Although a lot of great progresses have been made in the last few years, the situation is far from being completely clarified. In most case, new data and high statistics are needed, and they are expected to come from the LHC and the future flavor factories. At the same time, the analysis effort of the B-Factory experiments is still on going and new results are expected to come in the near future. Finally, we need more theoretical efforts to make further investigations, for example, in the case of \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and h b (nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 interpretation and their connections with the e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons cross sections. In conclusion, hadron spectroscopy is still an intriguing field, new or more precise measurements will continue to provide, in the near future, important information to better understand QCD and its effective treatments, with a broad impact on many other fields.",

For the analysis of the \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , in addition of the the missing mass M M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) associated with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system, the events are further identified by the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair with an invariant mass in the range of 8.0 GeV/c 2 < M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 11.0 GeV/c 2 . Figure 16 shows Dalitz plots of the events in the signal regions for the three decay channels under study. In all cases, two horizontal bands are evident in the \u03a5(nS  in [93,94]. Results of the fits to \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 signal events are shown in Fig. 17, where one-dimensional projections of the data and fits are compared. To com-",
