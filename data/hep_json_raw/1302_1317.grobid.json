An excess of B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates with respect to the background expectations is observed with a statistical significance of 3.5 standard deviations. A branching fraction of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = (3.2 +1.5 \u22121.2 ) \u00d7 10 \u22129 is measured with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit. The measured branching fraction is in agreement with the expectation from the Standard Model. The observed number of B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates is consistent with the background expectation and an upper limit on the branching fraction of B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u221210 is obtained.",

Enhancements of the branching fractions of these decays are predicted in a variety of different extensions of the Standard Model, an overview is given in Ref. [4]. In one popular example, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the enhancement is proportional to tan 6 \u03b2, where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields. For large values of tan \u03b2, this search belongs to the most sensitive probes for physics beyond the SM which can be performed at collider experiments.

The first part of the dataset has already been analyzed [7] and was used to produce the lowest published limit on the decay rate of both decays B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Two main improvements have been implemented over the previous analysis: the use of particle identification to select B 0 (s) \u2192 h + h \u2212 decays which are used to calibrate the geometrical and kinematic variables, and a refined estimate of the exclusive backgrounds. The updated estimate of the exclusive backgrounds is also applied to the 2011 data and the results reevaluated. The results obtained with the combined 2011 and 2012 data sets supersede those of Ref. [7]. Candidate B 0 s,d \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events are required to be selected by a hardware and a subsequent software trigger [8], dominantly by single and dimuon lines. The first step of the final analysis is a simple selection, which removes the dominant part of the background and keeps about 60% of the reconstructed signal events. A second selection step, based on a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) reduces 80% of the remaining background while retaining 92% of the signal. More details on the selections are given in Ref. [6] ",
