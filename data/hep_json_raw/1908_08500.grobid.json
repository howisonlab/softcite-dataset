            "text": "A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is presented where at least one Higgs boson is produced and decays to two photons in the decay chains of pair-produced SUSY particles. Two analysis strategies are pursued: one focused on strong SUSY production and the other focused on electroweak SUSY production. The presence of charged leptons, additional Higgs boson candidates, and various kinematic variables are used to categorize events into search regions that are sensitive to different SUSY scenarios. The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.5 fb \u22121 . No statistically significant excess of events is observed relative to the standard model expectations. We exclude bottom squark pair production for bottom squark masses below 530 GeV and a lightest neutralino mass of 1 GeV; wino-like chargino-neutralino production in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) for chargino and neutralino masses below 235 GeV with a gravitino mass of 1 GeV; and higgsino-like chargino-neutralino production in GMSB, where the neutralino decays exclusively to a Higgs boson and a gravitino for neutralino masses below 290 GeV.",

            "text": "The Higgs boson (H) provides an intriguing opportunity to explore physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Many scenarios of physics beyond the SM postulate the existence of cascade decays of heavy states involving Higgs bosons [1,2]. In minimal supersymmetry (SUSY) [3], a Higgs boson may appear in processes involving the bottom squark ( b), the SUSY partner of the bottom quark. Bottom squarks are produced via strong interactions and then may decay to a Higgs boson, quarks, and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). Similarly charginos or neutralinos produced through the electroweak interaction may decay to a Higgs boson and the LSP. Of particular interest are gaugemediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) scenarios, where the lightest neutralino may decay to a Higgs boson and the gravitino LSP ( G) [4,5]. Similar searches have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations using proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC at center-of-mass energies of 8 [6,7] and 13 TeV [8][9][10][11].",

The branching ratio for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 of 0.227% from the SM is assumed. The dominant backgrounds are SM production of diphoton and photon+jets, which are modeled by functional fits to the diphoton mass distribution. The SM Higgs boson background constitutes a small fraction of the background for most of the phase space used in the search and is estimated from simulation samples. We have designed a new analysis to extend our sensitivity to both strong and electroweak SUSY production over the previously published result [8]. Two analysis strategies are pursued: one focuses on the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos by introducing additional event categories containing one or two charged-lepton candidates, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to SUSY signatures involving W and Z bosons, and the other is optimized for strong production by categorizing events in the number of jets and the number of jets identified as originating from the fragmentation of b quarks (\"btagged\"). The use of the two strategies enhances the overall sensitivity of the search, and increases the robustness of the result by exploring alternative phase space regions. Finally, we interpret the results in various simplified model scenarios of SUSY as summarized in figure 1, including bottom squark pair production, chargino-neutralino, and neutralino-pair production.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system [12], composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [13].",

Simulated samples of SM Higgs boson production through gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, associated production with a W or a Z boson, bbH, and ttH are generated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo v2.2.2 [14] event generator. The Higgs boson mass is assumed to be 125 GeV for the simulated event samples and is within the uncertainty of the currently best measured value [15,16]. The Higgs boson production cross sections are taken from ref. [17] and are computed to next-to-next-to-leading order plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithm in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) coupling constant and to NLO in the electroweak coupling constant. For the gluon fusion production mode, the sample is generated with up to two extra partons from initial-state radiation (ISR) at NLO accuracy and uses the FxFx matching scheme described in ref. [18]. The SUSY signal MC samples are generated using MadGraph5 amc@nlo at leading order accuracy with up to two extra partons in the matrix element calculations, with the MLM matching scheme described in ref. [19]. For samples simulating the 2016 data set, pythia v8.212 [20] is used to model the fragmentation and parton showering with the CUETP8M1 tune [21], while for samples simulating the 2017 data set, pythia v8.226 is used with the CP5 [22] tune. The NNPDF3.0 [23] and NNPDF3.1 [24] parton distribution function (PDF) sets are used for the 2016 and 2017 simulation samples, respectively. The production cross section for squark pair production is computed at NLO plus next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy in QCD [25][26][27][28][29][30] under the assumption that all SUSY particles other than those in the relevant diagram are too heavy to participate in the interaction. The cross sections for higgsino pair production are computed at NLO+NLL precision in the limit of mass-degenerate higgsinos \u03c7 0 2 , \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , and \u03c7 0 1 , with all the other sparticles assumed to be heavy and decoupled [31][32][33].

They are propagated by profiling the associated unconstrained functional form parameters. The fraction of the total uncertainty due to the nonresonant background fit ranges from 75% to 99%, and is above 90% for most search region bins. The subdominant systematic uncertainties in the SM Higgs boson background and SUSY signal are propagated through independent log-normal nuisance parameters that take both theoretical and instrumental effects into account. These systematic uncertainties affect the event yield predictions of the SM Higgs boson background and SUSY signal in the different search region bins, and are propagated as shape uncertainties. The independent systematic effects considered include missing higher-order QCD corrections, PDFs, trigger and object selection efficiencies, jet energy scale uncertainties, b-tagging efficiency, lepton identification efficiencies, fast simulation p miss T modeling, and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The typical size of these effects on the signal and background yields are summarized in table 4, and are approximately the same for the SP and EWP analyses. Systematic uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are estimated by the use of the procedure outlined in ref. [56], where the factorization (\u00b5 F ) and renormalization (\u00b5 R ) scales are varied independently by factors of 0.5 and 2.0. The PDF systematic uncertainties are propagated for the SM Higgs background as a shape uncertainty using the LHC4PDF procedure [57].",

For more compressed regions of the signal model parameter space, where the neutralino mass approaches the Higgs boson mass, the search region bins with large p \u03b3\u03b3 T in the leptonic categories contribute significantly to the search sensitivity. The search region bins with small values of p \u03b3\u03b3 T and small values of the kinematic variables M R , R 2 , and m T2 typically have low sensitivity to the simplified models considered due to higher levels of background, but are included to maintain inclusivity for this search.",
