The top quark decay includes an electron or a muon while the Higgs boson decays into a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds is observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction are derived in the T quark mass range 700 to 1800 GeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, values of the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction greater than 0.8 and 0.7 pb are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming left-and right-handed coupling of the T quark to standard model particles, respectively. This is the first analysis setting exclusion limits on the cross section of singly produced vector-like T quarks at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.",

Given the limited impact that vector-like quarks have on the properties of the SM Higgs boson, they are not similarly constrained [15]. E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. This letter presents the results of the first search for singly produced vector-like top quark partners with charge +2/3 (T) at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. Single production is of particular interest, since its rate dominates over the rate of pair production at large quark masses. Many of the models mentioned above predict that the T quark will predominantly decay to thirdgeneration SM quarks via three channels: tH, tZ, and bW [15]. Searches for T quarks have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations setting lower limits on the T quark mass ranging from 715 to 950 GeV for various T quark branching fractions [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. While most of the past searches considered pair production of the T quarks via the strong interaction, the single production mode where the T quark is produced via the weak interaction has recently been investigated by the ATLAS Collaboration [16,19,20] at 8 TeV, and is targeted in this letter. The strength of the T quark coupling to electroweak bosons has an effect both on the cross section and the width of the T quark [23]. There are no a priori constraints on the electroweak T quark coupling. Therefore, not only the general coupling to the electroweak sector but the couplings of the T quark to bW, tZ, and tH can also take arbitrary values. The present analysis targets decays of the T quark into a Higgs boson and a top quark. It will be sensitive to the existence of a T quark only if sufficiently large couplings to bW or tZ are present as well, since the T quark production through a Higgs http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2017.05.019 0370-2693/\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The search is optimised for decays of the T quark into a Higgs boson and a top quark, where the top quark decay includes a lepton (electron or muon) and the Higgs boson is required to decay into b quarks. For a T quark mass in the TeV range, the Higgs boson and the top quark obtain large Lorentz boosts leading to merged jets and nonisolated leptons in the final state. Jet substructure analysis in combination with algorithms for the identification of b quark jets (b tagging) can efficiently identify boosted decays of the Higgs boson into b quark pairs [22]. An additional distinctive feature of the signal is the presence of a jet in the regions close to the beam pipe, a so-called forward jet. This jet results from the light-flavour quark that is produced in association with the T quark. Background processes due to top quark pair production are dominant, followed by W+jets and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet processes. For every event, a T quark candidate four-momentum is reconstructed, with mass M T . Events are selected by imposing requirements on the T quark candidate and other attributes of the event. The M T variable is used as the final discriminant in a combined signal plus background fit to the data. The shape of the total background is estimated from a signal-depleted region in the recorded data.",

The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The momentum resolution for electrons with transverse momentum p T \u2248 45 GeV and above from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for non-showering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [27].

Two different jet sizes are used independently: jets with a size parameter of 0.4 (\"AK4 jets\") and 0.8 (\"AK8 jets\"). Jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of the charged particle momenta in the jet that are identified as originating from the primary interaction vertex, and the neutral particle momenta. An area-based correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings (\"pileup\") [31]. The energy of a jet is found from simulation to be within 5-10% of the true jet momentum at particle level over the entire p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events [32]. A smearing of the jet energy is applied to simulated events to mimic detector resolution effects observed in data. For the identification of b jets, the combined secondary vertex b tagging algorithm is used [33]. The algorithm uses information from secondary b hadron decay vertices to distinguish b jets from other jet flavours. The jet energy resolution is typically 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Jets are reconstructed up to |\u03b7| = 5 while b tagging is restricted by the tracker acceptance to |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

Systematic uncertainties are included as nuisance parameters. For rate-only uncertainties a log-normal prior is assigned. A flat prior is used for the signal strength. Shape uncertainties in the signal templates are taken into account using template morphing with cubic-linear interpolation, where the cubic interpolation is used up to the one sigma deviation and the linear interpolation beyond that. For the background normalization a Gaussian prior with 100% width is used. The statistical uncertainty in the background estimate is included with the \"Barlow-Beeston light\" method [59], which uses a Gaussian approximation of the uncertainty in each bin. A bias-test is performed by injecting a signal into the fitted data. The biases are observed to be negligible.",
