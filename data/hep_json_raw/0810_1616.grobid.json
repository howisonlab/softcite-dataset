The accurate knowledge of properties of heavy flavor physics plays an essential role for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Asymmetric-energy e + e -B factories (BaBar and Belle) run their operation and will upgrade B factories to become super Belle. The size of available B meson samples will be dramatically increased. Also the data size of Tevatron experiments (CDF, D0) are on the order of PetaByte. Therefore we use new concept of e-Science for heavy flavor physics. This concept is about studying heavy flavor physics anytime and anywhere even if we are not on-site of accelerator laboratories and data size is immense. The component of this concept is data production, data processing and data analysis anytime and",

However, the origins of families are unknown in the standard model. Only the charged-current electroweak interaction can change flavors in the standard model. Electroweak eigenstates are not mass eigenstates, which introduced CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix [1]. There are only the standard model connections between generations. CKM matrix elements are fundamental parameters of the standard model. They cannot be predicted theoretically but can be measured by experiments. CKM matrix has three rotation parameters and one phase parameter. Even if the non-zero phase parameter implies CPV (Charge Parity Violation) in flavor transitions, its origin is still one of the mysteries of elementary particle physics. The CPV can occur when multiple B decay amplitude interfere each other. B system is uniquely situated for CPV studies due to mixing, long lifetime, large prediction cross section, rich decay set and heavy quarks, which is theoretically accessible.",
