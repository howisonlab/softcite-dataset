Our flagship channel is the decay into three charged pions: p + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + + p recoil , for which COMPASS has acquired the so far world's largest dataset of roughly 50 M exclusive events using an 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam. Based on this dataset, we performed an extensive partial-wave analysis. In order to extract the resonance parameters of the \u03c0 J and a J states that appear in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + system, we performed the so far largest resonance-model fit, using Breit-Wigner resonances and non-resonant contributions. This method in combination with the high statistical precision of our measurement allows us to study ground and excited states. We have found an evidence of the a 1 (1640) and a 2 (1700) in our data, which are the first excitations of the a 1 (1260) and a 2 (1320), respectively. The relative strength of the excited states with respect to the corresponding ground state is larger in the f 2 (1270) \u03c0 decay mode compared to the \u03c1(770) \u03c0 decay mode. We also study the spectrum of \u03c0 2 states in our data. Therefore, we simultaneously describe four J PC = 2 \u2212+ waves in the resonancemodel fit by using three \u03c0 2 resonances, the \u03c0 2 (1670), the \u03c0 2 (1880), and the \u03c0 2 (2005). Within the limits of our model, we can conclude that the \u03c0 2 (2005) is required to describe all four 2 \u2212+ waves properly.",

Each dynamical amplitude is multiplied by a coupling amplitude C k \u03b1 \u03b1 (t ), which determines the strength and phase with which each component contributes to the corresponding wave. We use independent coupling amplitudes for each t bin. Thus, also in this analysis step, we impose no model for the t dependence of the components. We simultaneously describe all 11 t bins in one resonance-model fit, keeping the mass and width parameters of each resonance component the same in each t bin.

The huge amount of information condensed in this fit, in combination with the information from the t -resolved analysis allows us to study ground as well as excited states. We observe signals of the a 1 (1640) and a 2 (1700), which are the first excitations of the a 1 (1260) and a 2 (1320),respectively. As both states appear in the high-mass tails of the dominant ground states, we extract their parameters with large systematic uncertainties. Our estimate for their widths is systematically larger in comparison to previous observations, which might indicate an imperfect separation of the wave components in the corresponding mass regions. We also observe, that the \u03c1(770) \u03c0 decay mode of the 1 ++ and 2 ++ waves is dominated by the ground states, while the excited states are more dominant in the f 2 (1270) \u03c0 decay mode. Also in the 2 \u2212+ waves we observe that the different resonances contribute with different relative strength to the different decay modes. Furthermore, we require a second excited state, the \u03c0 2 (2005), to describe properly all four 2 \u2212+ partial waves simultaneously. To reduce the systematic uncertainties and further clarify the existence of higher states, models that are based on the principles of unitarity and analyticity are mandatory, especially in waves where the non-resonant contributions are important.",
