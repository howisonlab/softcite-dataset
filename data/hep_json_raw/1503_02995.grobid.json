            "text": "Excited charmed mesons are of great theoretical and experimental interest as they allow detailed studies of QCD in an interesting energy regime. Good progress has been achieved in identifying and measuring the parameters of the orbitally excited states, notably from Dalitz plot (DP) analyses of three-body B decays. Relevant examples include the studies of [3] decays, which provide information on excited neutral and charged charmed mesons (collectively referred to as D \u00c3\u00c3 states), respectively. First results on excited charm-strange mesons have also recently been obtained with the DP analysis technique [4][5][6]. Studies of prompt charm resonance production in e \u00fe e \u2212 and pp collisions [7,8] have revealed a number of additional high-mass states. Most of these higher-mass states are not yet confirmed by independent analyses, and their spectroscopic identification is unclear. Analyses of resonances produced directly from e \u00fe e \u2212 and pp collisions do not allow determination of the quantum numbers of the produced states, but can distinguish whether or not they have natural spin parity (i.e. J P in the series 0 \u00fe ; 1 \u2212 ; 2 \u00fe ; \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1). The current experimental knowledge of the neutral D \u00c3\u00c3 states is summarized in Table I (here and throughout the paper, natural units with \u210f \u00bc c \u00bc 1 are used). The D \u00c3 0 \u00f02400\u00de 0 , D 1 \u00f02420\u00de 0 , D 0 1 \u00f02430\u00de 0 and D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de 0 mesons are generally understood to be the four orbitally excited (1P) states. The experimental situation as well as the spectroscopic identification of the heavier states is less clear.",

One of the most powerful methods to determine \u03b3 uses B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decays, with the neutral D meson decaying to CP eigenstates [12,13]. The sensitivity to \u03b3 arises due to the interference of amplitudes proportional to the CKM matrix elements V ub and V cb , associated withD 0 and D 0 production respectively. However, a challenge for such methods is to determine the ratio of magnitudes of the two amplitudes, r B , that must be known to extract \u03b3. This is usually handled by including D-meson decays to additional final states in the analysis. By contrast, in B \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3\u00c3 K \u2212 decays the efficiency-corrected ratio of yields of [14]. The decay B \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3\u00c3 K \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 0 K \u2212 where the D meson is reconstructed in CP eigenstates can be used to search for CP violation driven by \u03b3. Measurement of the first two of these processes would therefore provide knowledge of r B in B \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3\u00c3 K \u2212 decays, indicating whether or not a competitive measurement of \u03b3 can be made with this approach.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector [17] surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [18] placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data taking. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [19]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [20].",

The mass and width of the D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de 0 resonance are determined from the fit to improve the fit quality. Since the mass and width of the D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de 0 state have not been precisely determined by previous experiments, these parameters are also allowed to vary in the fit. The masses and widths of the D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de 0 and D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de 0 are reported in Table VI. The spin of the D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de 0 state has not been determined previously. Fits are performed with all values up to 3, and spin 1 is found to be preferred with changes relative to the spin-0, -2 and -3 hypotheses of 2\u0394NLL \u00bc 37.3; 49.5 and 48.2 units, respectively. For comparison, the value of 2\u0394NLL obtained from a fit with the D \u00c3 1 \u00f02760\u00de 0 state excluded is 75.0 units. The alternative models discussed in Sec. VIII give very similar values and therefore do not affect the conclusion that the D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de 0 state has spin 1. The values of the complex coefficients and fit fractions returned by the fit are shown in Table VII. Results for the interference fit fractions are given in Appendix B. The total fit fraction exceeds unity mostly due to interference between the D \u00c3 0 \u00f02400\u00de 0 and S-wave nonresonant contributions. The consistency of the fit model and the data is evaluated in several ways. Numerous one-dimensional projections (including several shown below and those shown in Sec. V) show good agreement. A two-dimensional \u03c7 2 value is determined by comparing the data and the fit model in 100 equally populated bins across the SDP. The pull, i.e. the difference between the data and fit model divided by the uncertainty, is shown with this SDP binning in Fig. 7. The \u03c7 2 value obtained is found to be within the bulk of the distribution expected from simulated pseudoexperiments. Other unbinned fit quality tests [48] also show acceptable agreement between the data and the fit model.

Therefore, the resonant contributions to the decay are also first observations. The significance of the B \u2212 \u2192 D \u00c3 1 \u00f02760\u00de 0 K \u2212 observation is investigated by removing the corresponding resonance from the DP model. A fit without the D \u00c3 1 \u00f02760\u00de 0 component increases the value of 2\u0394NLL by 75.0 units, corresponding to a high statistical significance. Only the systematic effects due to uncertainties in the DP model could in principle significantly change the conclusion regarding the need for this resonance. However, in alternative DP models where a D\u03c0 resonance with spin 3 is added and where the B \u00c3 v contribution is removed, the shift in 2\u0394NLL remains above 50 units. The alternative models also do not significantly impact the level at which the D \u00c3 1 \u00f02760\u00de 0 state is preferred to be spin 1.
