            "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began colliding protons at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the end of March 2010. In the subsequent months, the luminosity has increased more or less exponentially: approximately 16 nb \u22121 had been delivered to each experiment at the start of the BEACH2010 workshop, and at the time of writing these proceedings this has risen to approximately 2 pb \u22121 . Production of charmed hadrons is a natural topic to probe with these data samples: the cross sections are large enough to make precise measurements even with limited data samples, and early studies on charm distributions will improve our understanding of hadronic events at the LHC for subsequent analyses. It is anticipated that O(70 pb \u22121 ) will be delivered during the 2010 run, and O(1 fb \u22121 ) in 2011 [1]. In this note, we discuss the status of measurements of the cross section for prompt production of open and hidden charm mesons in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV in bins of rapidity y and transverse momentum p t .",

This motivates the design of LHCb [2], a singlearm forward spectrometer, which instruments the angular range 15 < \u03b8 x < 300 mrad and 15 < \u03b8 y < 250 mrad, corresponding to approximately 2.0 < \u03b7 < 5.2, where \u03b8 x and \u03b8 y are the x and y projections of the polar angle, \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity, and the z-axis corresponds to the nominal beam direction. This coverage is complementary to the other large LHC experiments [3,4,5]. The LHCb detector includes a silicon microstrip Vertex Locator (VELO) which is positioned at 5 mm from the beam during data-taking; five downstream tracking stations which use a combination of silicon pixels and drift chambers; two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors with three different radiators to cover the momentum range 2 < p < 100 GeV/c; a calorimeter consting of a Scintillator Pad Detector (SPD) to detect charged particles, an electromagnetic calorimeter with a preshower detector, and a hadronic calorimeter; five muon stations; and a magnet with a field integral of 4 Tm.",
