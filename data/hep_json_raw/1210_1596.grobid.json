Data taken with the CLEO-c detector at \u221a s = 3.772 GeV and 4.170 GeV, with integrated luminosities of 805 pb \u22121 and 586 pb \u22121 , respectively, have been used to study e + e \u2212 annihilations into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 , and pp. The dimensional counting rule prediction that at large Q 2 the quantity Q 2 F (Q 2 ) for pseudoscalar mesons is nearly constant, and should vary only weakly as the strong coupling constant, \u03b1S(Q 2 ), is confirmed for both pions and kaons. However, the measurements are in strong quantitative disagreement with the predictions of the existing QCDbased models. For protons, it is found that the timelike form factors continue to remain nearly twice as large as the corresponding spacelike form factors measured in electron elastic scattering, in significant violation of the expectation of their equality at large Q 2 . Further, in contrast to pions and kaons, a significant difference is observed between the values of the corresponding quantity |Q 4 |GM (|Q 2 |)/\u00b5p for protons at |Q 2 | = 14.2 GeV 2 and 17.4 GeV 2 . The results suggest the constancy of |Q 2 |GM (|Q 2 |)/\u00b5p, instead, at these large |Q 2 |.",

The measurement of pion and kaon timelike form factors by CLEO at Q 2 = 13.48 GeV 2 [5] revealed that while the dimensional counting rule prediction of a \u03b1 S /|Q 2 | variation of the form factors [6] was apparently confirmed, the measured form factors were factors 4\u22128 larger than predicted. Further, the ratio F \u03c0 (|Q 2 |)/F K (|Q 2 |) was also found to be nearly twice as large as the QCD prediction that it should be equal to the ratio of the squares of the decay constants, f 2 \u03c0 /f 2 K at large Q 2 [7]. These large differences from theoretical predictions raise important questions about how valid the asymptotic predictions are at the measured momentum transfers, and make it imperative to extend the measurements to larger momentum transfers.",

The main body of the data comprise of e + e \u2212 annihilations at center-ofmass energies \u221a s = 3772 MeV (|Q 2 | = 14. No measurements of the branching fractions for non-DD two-body decays of either \u03c8(3772) or \u03c8(4160) to light hadrons exist [9], but they can be estimated using the perturbative QCD (pQCD) prediction that the hadronic decays of \u03c8(nS) states scale with the principle quantum number n in the same way as the dilepton decays. The measured values, B(\u03c8(3770) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and B(\u03c8(4160) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ), are \u2248 10 3 times smaller than B(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) [9].

This leads to the estimates that with more than 5.2 million \u03c8(3772) and \u03c8(4160) formed in the present measurements, the numbers of resonantly produced \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 , and pp are \u223c 0.04, 0.4, and 1.8, respectively. In other words, the resonance contribution to their yield is expected to be vanishingly small, and the counts observed in the present analysis can be entirely attributed to the timelike electromagnetic form factors.",

Also shown in the figure are three illustrative theoretical predictions. The Q 2 behavior of the prediction of the QCD sum rule inspired model [16] disagrees strongly with the data. The pQCD prediction of Gousset and Pire [17] is nearly a factor two smaller than our measurements, and the latest AdS/QCD prediction by Brodsky and de Teramond [18] reproduces the data below 5 GeV 2 , but falls to 2/3 of the observed values for |Q 2 | > 5 GeV 2 .

This is reminiscent of the fact that for the spacelike momentum transfers for the equivalent form factors, F 1 (Dirac) and F 2 (Pauli), it is QF 2 /F 1 which is found to be constant, rather than Q 2 F 2 /F 1 as predicted [7].",

For pions and kaons we find that the dimensional counting rule prediction of \u03b1 S /Q 2 variation of the form factors with |Q 2 | holds very well. However, the existing theoretical predictions for pions fail by large factors to predict the magnitude of the form factors. We find F \u03c0 (|Q 2 |)/F K (|Q 2 |) = 1.21(3) and 1.09(4) for |Q 2 | = 14.2 GeV 2 and 17.4 GeV 2 , respectively. These are in agreement with F \u03c0 (|Q 2 |)/F K (|Q 2 |) = 1.19(17) measured at 13.48 GeV 2 [5], and in large disagreement with the asymptotic prediction that they should be equal to the ratio of the squares of the decay constants, f 2 \u03c0 /f 2 K = 0.67(1). For protons, we find that the timelike form factors continue to be a factor two or more larger than the corresponding spacelike form factors, as shown in Fig. 2. We find the unexpected result that |Q 4 |G M (|Q 2 |)/\u00b5 p at |Q 2 | = 14.2 GeV 2 is 22(4)% smaller than at |Q 2 | = 17.4 GeV 2 . The difference is suggestive of the nearconstancy of |Q 2 |G M (|Q 2 |)/\u00b5 p , instead.",
