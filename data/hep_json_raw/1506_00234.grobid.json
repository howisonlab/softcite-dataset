However, they rely on the use of control samples to subtract the charge-asymmetric background originating from hadrons wrongly identified as leptons or leptons from light hadron decays, and to compute the charge-dependent lepton identification asymmetry that may produce a false signal. The systematic uncertainties associated with the corrections for these effects constitute a severe limitation of the precision of the measurements. Particularly obnoxious is the case when a lepton from a direct B semileptonic decay is combined with a lepton of equal charge from a charm meson produced in the decay of the other B. As the mixing probability is rather low, this background process is enhanced with respect to the signal, so that stringent kinematic selections need to be applied. Authors of [14] suggest that at least a part of the D0 dilepton discrepancy could be due to charm decays.",

The positions of points along the trajectories of charged particles measured with the SVT are used for vertex reconstruction and for measuring the momentum of charged particles, including those particles with low transverse momentum that do not reach the DCH due to the bending in the magnetic field. The energy loss in the SVT is used to discriminate lowmomentum pions from electrons. Higher-energy electrons are identified from the ratio of the energy of their associated shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) to their momentum, the transverse profile of the shower, the energy loss in the DCH, and the information from the Cherenkov detector (DIRC). The electron identification efficiency is 93%, and the misidentification rate for pions and kaons is less than 1%.",

As discussed above, this sample consists of about 75% genuine K R , where the residual number of events with a K T is mostly due to mixing. Therefore we select events with a second high-momentum lepton, with charge opposite to that of the first lepton. According to the simulation, this raises the K R purity in the sample to about 87%. Finally, we use topological variables, correlating the kaon momentum-vector to those of the two leptons, to raise the K R purity in the sample to about 95%. Due to the large number of events, the fit complexity, and the high number of floated parameters, the time needed for an unbinned fit to reach convergence is too large; therefore we perform a binned maximum likelihood fit.
