            "text": "A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production, as predicted by the Standard Model, is presented, where one of the Higgs bosons decays via the H \u2192 bb channel and the other via one of the H \u2192 W W * /Z Z * /\u03c4 \u03c4 channels. The analysis selection requires events to have at least two b-tagged jets and exactly two leptons (electrons or muons) with opposite electric charge in the final state. Candidate events consistent with Higgs boson pair production are selected using a multi-class neural network discriminant. The analysis uses 139 fb \u22121 of pp collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. An observed (expected) upper limit of 1.2 (0.9 +0.4   \u22120.3 ) pb is set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section at 95% confidence level, which is equivalent to 40 (29 +14 \u22129 ) times the value predicted in the Standard Model.",

            "text": "In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported the observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson (H ) [1,2]. So far, measurements of the spin and couplings of the new particle are consistent with those predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism of the SM [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. The SM predicts non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs (H H) in proton-proton (pp) collisions, referred to as non-resonant H H production, with the dominant production modes at the LHC proceeding via the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) process. The ggF process has two leading order contributions: the first corresponds to the so-called 'triangle diagram', which includes the Higgs boson selfcoupling, and the second is the so-called 'box diagram', which includes a heavy-quark loop with two fermion-fermion-Higgs ( f f H) vertices. These two amplitudes interfere destructively, resulting in a low cross-section of only 31.05 \u00b1 1.90 fb for the ggF H H production mode, computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and including finite top-quark mass effects [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. Feynman diagrams illustrating these two contributions are shown in Fig. 1. The measurement of non-resonant H H production at the LHC stands as an important test of the BEH mechanism. In many beyond-the-SM (BSM) theories, H H production can be enhanced by modifying the Higgs boson self-coupling, \u03bb H H H , or the top-quark Yukawa coupling, y t , and/or by introducing new contact interactions between E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have performed searches for non-resonant H H production in a variety of final states at 13 TeV [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. No significant excess of events beyond SM expectations is observed in these searches, with the ATLAS and CMS data-analyses setting observed (expected) limits on non-resonant H H production to be no larger than 6.9 (10.0) and 22.2 (12.8) times the predicted rate in the SM, respectively [34,35].",

The selection of candidate events with oppositely charged leptons is based on a combination of single-lepton and dilepton triggers. 2 The use of a given trigger depends on the flavour and the transverse momenta (p T ) of the two (p T -ordered) leptons in the event, and on the data-taking period. Single-lepton triggers with p T thresholds between 22 and 28 GeV are given priority over dilepton triggers. The criteria of the dilepton triggers are checked only if no single-lepton trigger criteria are met and have p T thresholds as low as 19 (10) GeV for the leading (subleading) lepton. At least one reconstructed lepton (or lepton pair) has to match a corresponding trigger object, in which case their offline p T must be higher than the trigger threshold by at least 2 GeV, in order to be on the efficiency plateau of the corresponding trigger.",

The generated signal events were reweighted with form factors that take into account the finite mass of the top-quark [46,47]. SM background processes were simulated using different MC event generators. The MC matrix element (ME) event generators and PDF sets, the parton showering (PS) and the underlying event (UE) modelling, UE tuned parameters (tune), and the accuracy of the theoretical cross-sections used to normalise the simulated processes are summarised in Table 1. Each SM background process is normalised to the best available respective theoretical cross-section. The mass of the Higgs boson was set to 125 GeV for all signal and background processes. The H H branching fractions (BF) predicted by the SM [13] are used for all Higgs boson decays. MadSpin [48] was used to model top-quark spin correlations and EvtGen [49] was used to model properties of b-and c-hadron decays for processes using Pythia and for the signal processes. SM top-quark pair production (tt) and the production of single top-quarks in association with W bosons (W t) contribute with significant background contamination in the bb \u03bd \u03bd final state. At next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy, there exists non-trivial interference between these two processes that may be enhanced in phase-space regions wherein there are high fractions of W t events [50]. Two schemes are typically used to remove the overlap between these two processes: the so-called diagram removal (DR) and diagram subtraction (DS) schemes [51]; the former is used in the present analysis to remove the overlapping events and the latter is used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty in corresponding background event yields. Because of these effects, the sum of the simulated tt and W t processes is considered as a single background process and referred to as the 'Top' process in what follows.",

However, the sum of all three signal components is evaluated as the signal when performing the statistical analysis. Additionally, all processes that make up the training sample (H H \u2192 bbW W * , Top, Z-, and Z-\u03c4 \u03c4 ) have the same weight during the training of the classifier. The training sample is composed of simulated candidate events with m > 20 GeV and having one or more b-tagged jets, where events with exactly one b-tagged jet are included to increase the number of events available for training. For the training events with exactly one b-tagged jet, each observable that requires at least two b-tagged jets is set to its mean value as computed with the full set of training events that contain at least two b-tagged jets. Observables that require two b-tagged jets are defined using the leading two b-tagged jets. The classifier contains two fully connected hidden layers each with 250 nodes. Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations are used for each layer [117]. In order to improve the robustness of the training and to reduce effects due to overtraining, there is a dropout layer that randomly drops 50% of the nodes between the two fully connected layers during training [118]. The classifier produces four outputs that are passed through a softmax activation, constraining their sum to one [36].",

These normalisation corrections have a uniform prior and are checked in two validation regions, VR-1 and VR-2, enriched with events from the Top and Z /\u03b3 * + HF processes. The control and validation regions are defined in Table 3 and are kinematically close to the signal regions. CR-Top (CR-Z+HF) and VR-1 (VR-2) are defined by inverting the m bb (m ) requirements relative to those of the signal regions but retain a selection of the high d H H region similar to the signal regions. The d H H selections were relaxed to increase statistical power, independent checks showed that this did not have a significant impact on the post-fit normalisation corrections in Table 3. VR-1 keeps only those events with m bb > 140 GeV, excluding the region m bb < 100 GeV which is included in CR-Top, due to significant contamination of Z /\u03b3 * + HF events. The correlations between the m and m bb observables and d H H after the preselection are observed to be small and do not prevent the use of the former two in the construction of the analysis regions defined in Table 3, as d H H is found to rely mainly on the information provided by the additional input observables listed in Table 2. This absence of strong correlation ensures that the measurements made in the tails of d H H in the control regions can be extrapolated to those in the signal regions.",

The uncertainties due to the modelling of initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR, respectively) in the generators used to simulate the Top background processes are evaluated using the method described in Ref. [122]. The Top background composition is varied within the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions for the tt and single-top-quark W t cross-sections [65,68,123]. The uncertainty arising from the interference between the NLO predictions for tt and W t processes is estimated by taking the difference between the predicted Top background yields obtained with the DR and DS schemes used for the NLO W t calculation [122]. The uncertainties due to PDF variations are computed as the envelope of the central values of the nominal NNPDF3.0 PDF set and the CT14, MMHT14, and PDF4LHC15_30PDF PDF sets [124]. All uncertainties except those in the scale variations, cross-section, and interference are considered as fully correlated between the tt and W t pro- The uncertainties due to experimental sources arise primarily from the mismeasurement of reconstructed object momenta and from the mismodelling of reconstruction efficiencies. These uncertainties include uncertainties from the mismodelling of the jet energy scale (JES) [109] and jet energy resolution (JER) [126]. Additional uncertainties for b-tagged jets arise from the mismodelling of the b-tagging efficiency [111] and from the mismodelling of the rates at which charm-and light-flavoured jets are selected as b-tagged jets [127,128]. Lepton-related uncertainties arise from the mismodelling of the electron [104] (muon [105]) reconstructed energy (momentum) measurements, as well as in the mismodelling of their reconstruction and identification efficiencies [104,105]. The E miss T scale and resolution [113] uncertainties, as well as uncertainties from the mismodelling of pile-up, trigger efficiency and luminosity, are also taken into account. The uncertainty in the combined 2015-2018 integrated luminosity is 1.7% [129], obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [130] for the primary luminosity measurements.

Due to spincorrelation effects present in the H \u2192 W W * \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd decay within the dominant H H \u2192 bbW W * signal process, the signal events exhibit values of m that are typically below 60 GeV. By selecting low values of m , the signal purity can therefore be enhanced while rejecting a large component of the SM Z boson and Top backgrounds. Additionally, m bb has a peak at the mass of the Higgs boson for the signal process and therefore provides an effective means to define selections in which the H H contribution is enhanced. The signal selection criteria therefore require m \u2208 (20, 60) GeV and m bb \u2208 (110, 140) GeV. The m > 20 GeV requirement is enforced in order to remove contamination from low-mass resonances and Z /\u03b3 * processes. The signal selection criteria are further broken down into same-flavour (SF), i.e. ee or \u03bc\u03bc, or different-flavour (DF), i.e. e\u03bc, regions. Separating by dilepton flavour enhances the separation power between the signal and Z /\u03b3 * background; the former has roughly equal probabilities for the SF and DF final states and the latter leads predominantly to SF final states.

An additional uncertainty in the Z /\u03b3 * process is computed by taking the difference between the nominal Sherpa 2.2.1 samples with samples generated using MadGraph 5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8. The dominant uncertainties in the total background estimates in SR-SF are the Z /\u03b3 * + HF modelling uncertainties (8%), primarily that due to comparison of Sherpa 2.2.1 and MadGraph 5_aMC@NLO, and the parton shower uncertainty affecting the Top background process (5%). The uncertainties in the background estimates in SR-DF are dominated by the uncertainty due to the parton shower affecting the Top background process (12%), the uncertainty in the Top normalisation correction \u03bc Top (10%), the uncertainty due to the comparison between the generators used for the Top process (7.5%), and the uncertainty due to the modelling of ISR and FSR in the Top process (5%). Systematic uncertainties in the signal acceptance due to varying \u03bc r and \u03bc f , as well as PDF-induced uncertainties, are evaluated using the same procedure as for the Top background process. The resulting scale (PDF) uncertainties are < 3% (< 1%) in both signal regions. The uncertainty due to the parton shower modelling is computed by comparing Herwig7 with Pythia8, and is found to be 8% (9%) in SR-SF (SR-DF). The uncertainty in the H H production cross-section, evaluated to be 5%, is included as an uncertainty in \u03c3 SM (gg \u2192 H H) when computing the upper limits on the cross-section ratio in Table 5.

A complete list is provided inTable 2. The event-wide input observables are sensitive to the presence of Higgs hemispheres in the signal and are largely angular in nature or take advantage of the fact that the final state objects from each of the Higgs bosons in the signal tend to be near to each other. The observables H R T2 and m bb T2 are non-standard high-level observables that are not straightforward functions of the momenta of the final-state objects. By construction, H R T2 can take values between zero and one; it peaks near one for signal and is more broadly distributed for background.The m bb T2 observable is defined similarly to the M bb T2 observable in Ref. [119] but does not include the final-state leptons. As discussed in Ref. [119], for the Top backgrounds m bb T2 generally has values below the mass of the top-quark due to kinematic constraints while for the Z /\u03b3 * processes, which have little-to-no E miss T",
