            "text": "The A N DY project at RHIC was proposed to measure the analyzing power for Drell-Yan production. Test runs took place during polarized proton operations of RHIC in 2011 and 2012 with a model of the A N DY apparatus in place. In total, an integrated luminosity of 9 pb \u22121 with beam polarization of 50% was sampled. The primary detector components were a hadron calorimeter (HCal) that spanned the pseudorapidity interval 2.4 < \u03b7 < 4.0 and a small electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal). Basic goals for A N DY test running were to establish the impact of a third interaction region on RHIC performance and to demonstrate HCal calibration. Energy scale of HCal was established using neutral pion reconstruction and checked with hadronic response. In addition, data with a trigger based on HCal energy sum were taken to study jet events. First measurements of analyzing power in the forward jet production are reported.",

            "text": "Large transverse single spin asymmetries (SSA) measured in inclusive pion production in pp-collisions [1,2] have stimulated significant theory development to understand the spin structure of the proton. However, this process is not easy to describe due to contributions from several mechanisms related to initial and final state interactions. Simpler processes from the theoretical point of view, such as Drell-Yan, prompt photon or jet production, should be considered to disentangle the different mechanisms. In particular, inclusive jet production is of interest since it has no final state (Collins effect) contribution, and arises only from the Sivers effect. From naive expectations, jet SSA should be small because jets integrate over charged and neutral pions, and opposite sign asymmetry for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 leads to cancellations. Theoretical models also expect jet SSA in the forward region to be small [3,4].",

The A N DY setup in 2011 run is described in [5], and included zero-degree calorimetry (ZDC) for luminosity monitoring and a check of polarization direction. For 2012 run HCal Left/Right modules were modified into an annular detector of 20\u00d712 cells with a 2\u00d72 hole for the beam pipe, and ECal was put on rails so that it could be moved out not to shadow HCal for jet measurements. The luminosity was 2\u00d7 higher compared to the 2011 run. Data were taken with two basic triggers: 1) energy sum in HCal Left/Right half, excluding two outer perimeters to ensure that jets are contained in the detector, with the threshold \u223c 35 GeV; 2) energy sum in ECal to measure trigger bias on jets.",

This method relies on mirror symmetry in the setup geometry, and cancels systematics, such as detector and luminosity asymmetries, through second order. To check time-dependent systematics, the asymmetry \u01eb was computed in x F bins for each RHIC fill and fitted by a constant function. \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom from these fits were close to 1, meaning that systematic errors are small. Bunch shuffling, i.e. random reversing of the spin direction for half of the filled bunch crossings that creates effectively unpolarized collisions, was used as another estimate of systematics. Mean value of the asymmetry calculated for \u223c100 random patterns was \u223c(10 \u22124 \u221210 \u22125 ), resulting in the systematic uncertainty in A N less than 2\u00d710 \u22124 . The analyzing power A N was calculated using fill-averaged beam polarization 0.52 for both beams, and is shown in Fig.2 for the cone and anti-k T jet finders. The results from the two algorithms are consistent within statistical errors. A N at x F > 0 is small (\u223c10 \u22123 ) and positive (up to 6\u03c3). Jet A N was also measured for ECal-triggered events, and turned out to be at the level (1-3)% for x F > 0.
