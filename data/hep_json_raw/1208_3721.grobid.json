Compared to J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 , relatively little is known concerning \u03c7 cJ decays [1]. More experimental data on exclusive decays of P-wave charmonia is important for a better understanding of the nature of \u03c7 cJ states, as well as testing QCD based calculations. Although these states are not directly produced in e + e \u2212 collisions, they are produced copiously in radiative decays of \u03c8 \u2032 , with branching fractions around 9% [1]. The large \u03c8 \u2032 data sample taken with the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) located at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPCII) provides an opportunity for a detailed study of \u03c7 cJ decays.",

There must be at least one \u03c0 0 candidate. A 1C kinematic fit is performed to the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3pn\u03c0 \u2212 hypothesis constraining the mass of the missing particle to that of the neutron, where the three photons are a \u03c0 0 candidate together with another photon. Kinematic fits are carried out over all possible three-photon combinations. The kinematic fit with the smallest \u03c7 2 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3pn\u03c0 \u2212 is retained, and \u03c7 2 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3pn\u03c0 \u2212 < 10 is required. If there is more than one \u03c0 0 candidate among the three photons, the pair with the invariant mass closest to the \u03c0 0 mass is assigned to be from the \u03c0 0 decay.

Selecting \u03c7 c0 events in the pn\u03c0 \u2212 decay mode, |M pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u2212 M \u03c7c0 | < 45 MeV/c 2 , the efficiency corrected p\u03c0 \u2212 andn\u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distributions are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5 (b), respectively.

The pn invariant mass is shown in Fig. 5 (c). A large enhancement in the pn threshold region is observed, which is also visible as a diagonal band along the upper right-band edge in the Dalitz plot in Fig. 5 (d). A similar threshold enhancement has qualitatively been observed elsewhere, such as a pp threshold enhancement in B meson decays [20][21][22][23][24][25], \u03c8 \u2032 decays [26], and in the shape of the timelike electromagnetic form factor of the proton measured at BaBar [27].",

To determine the systematic error associated with this procedure, an alternative method is used, where the efficiency, including the effect of these structures for \u03c7 cJ \u2192 pn\u03c0 \u2212 , is determined by re-weighting MC events generated according to phase space by the ratio of data and MC events in the two-dimensional distribution of p\u03c0 \u2212 versusn\u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass.

Fitting procedure As described above, the yields of the \u03c7 cJ signal events are derived from fits to the invariant mass spectra of pn\u03c0 \u2212 and pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . To evaluate the systematic uncertainty associated with the fitting procedure, we have studied the following aspects: (i) Fitting range: In the nominal fit, the mass spectra of pn\u03c0 \u2212 and pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are fitted from 3.30 GeV/c 2 to 3.60 GeV/c 2 and from 3.30 GeV/c 2 to 3.64 GeV/c 2 , respectively. We have changed these intervals to 3.32\u22123.60 GeV/c 2 in the case of pn\u03c0 \u2212 and 3.32\u22123.62 GeV/c 2 for pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events. The differences in the finally obtained branching fractions by changing the fit intervals, are taken as the systematic uncertainties associated with the fit intervals. (ii) Signal lineshape: The partial width for an E1/M1 radiative transition is proportional to the cube of the radiative photon energy (E 3 \u03b3 ), which leads to a diverging tail in lower mass region. Two damping functions have been proposed by the KEDR [30] and the CLEO [31] collaborations and have been used in addition to the standard approach in the formula describing the fit to the signal lineshape. Differences with respect to the fit not taking into account this damping factor have been observed, and the greater of the two differences is taken as the systematic uncertainty associated with the signal lineshape. (iii) Mass resolution parameterization: A single Gaussian formula instead of the modified Gaussian formula (Formula 2) has been used to describe the instrumental mass resolution. The resulting differences for the final branching fractions are taken as the systematic uncertainties. (iv) Mass resolution: Studies have shown that the \u03c7 cJ mass resolutions, as simulated by MC, are underestimated. To evaluate the systematic effects associated with this aspect, the invariant masses of pn\u03c0 \u2212 and pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 in the MC samples are smeared with a Gaussian function, where the width of this Gaussian depends on the invariant mass as well as on the channel. The same fitting processes as in the nominal cases are performed on the smeared mass spectra of pn\u03c0 \u2212 and pn\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and the detection efficiencies are recalculated. The efficiency difference between the smeared and unsmeared case is taken as the systematic uncertainty. (v) Background shape: To estimate the uncertainties due to the background parameterizations, a second order instead of a third order Chebychev polynomial is applied in the fitting. Again, the difference between the two cases is used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty.",

For the other \u03c7 cJ decay modes, the branching fractions are measured for the first time. A comparison of individual branching fraction shows good agreement between charge conjugate channels. The measurements improve the existing knowledge of the \u03c7 cJ states and may provide further insight into  ",
