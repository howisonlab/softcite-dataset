The right part of Fig. 1 includes a scheme of the waveform shape after pole-zero correction. The falling edge of the pole-zero corrected waveform is flat and its value should correspond to the amount of collected charge. However, events of the same energy can have (slightly) different values of collected charge due to the drift-path-dependent charge trapping, providing a degraded energy resolution [6]. To account for charge trapping effects, the time constant used in the standard pole-zero correction is modified as 1/\u03c4 = 1/\u03c4 PZ + 1/\u03c4 CT , where \u03c4 PZ is the standard pole-zero time constant and \u03c4 CT is the time constant associated with charge trapping. While the standard pole-zero correction can be obtained by studying the response of the electronic system, \u03c4 CT is chosen to be the value that minimizes FWHM. After including \u03c4 CT , the falling edges are aligned for events with the same energy, as in Fig. 1. The raw energy value is evaluated at a fixed time pickoff from t 0 of the trapezoidal filtered signal after correction.",

Weekly, Majorana Demonstrator takes around 3 hours of data with 228 Th sources inserted into the shield (90 minutes for each module) [3]. This data is used to calibrate each detector individually. The calibration process has two steps. In the first step, an initial linear energy scale is determined from electronic noise at zero energy and the position of the 208 Tl 2614 keV photopeak in the weekly calibration data. In the second step, combined statistics of all calibrations in a subset of data are used to perform a simultaneous linear fit to eight photopeaks in the calibration spectrum. An improved energy calibration is obtained, as shown in Fig. 2 with the eight peaks indicated. These peaks are at 239 keV ( 212 Pb), 241 keV ( 224 Ra), 277 keV ( 208 Tl), 300 keV ( 212 Pb), 583 keV ( 208 Tl), 727 keV ( 212 Bi), 861 keV ( 208 Tl) and 2614 keV ( 208 Tl). Peaks due to FIGURE 1.

First, they are filtered by a data cleaning process to remove non-physical waveforms while retaining >99.9% of true physics events [8]. As the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 event would not be produced by muons, a muon veto cut is applied to reject events within 1s of a triggering of the muon veto system [9]. 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 is a single-detector and spatially single-site process since the emitted electrons deposit their total energy within a small range compared with the ability of the detector to localize the energy deposition. This feature is used to reject a range of backgrounds, including multiple Compton-scattered photons, with two different cuts. The first cut is the multiplicity cut, which rejects any events that trigger more than one detector within a \u223c4 \u00b5s time window. The inefficiencies of this cut and the muon veto are negligible but the dead times are taken into account in the exposure calculation. The other cut, known as AvsE [10], rejects events with multiple energy depositions in the same detector based on the relationship between the maximum current (A) and energy (E). This cut is tuned using 228 Th calibration source data, where 90% of single-site events are retained. Furthemore, a delayed charge recovery (DCR) cut removes alpha particles that impinge upon the passivated surfaces of PPC HPGe detectors [11]. These events deposit energy in the passivated surface, and the generated charge carriers are released to the bulk slowly, which modifies the slope of the falling edge. The DCR parameter is related to the falling edge slope which allows the removal of such background with a signal efficiency of 99%.",
