            "text": "With increasing accuracy of the measurement of m s , the counterpart of m d in the B 0 s -B 0 s system [7], a more precise knowledge of m d becomes important, as the ratio m d / m s together with input from lattice QCD calculations [8,9] constrains the apex of the CKM unitarity triangle [10,11]. Therefore, the measurement of m d provides an important test of the Standard Model [12,13]. Furthermore, m d is an input parameter in the determination of sin 2\u03b2 at LHCb [14]. This Letter presents a measurement of m d , using a dataset corresponding to 1.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, using the decay channels B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + (D \u2212 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 ) and B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * 0 ( J /\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and their charge conjugated modes. For a measurement of m d , the flavour of the B 0 meson at production and decay must be known. The flavour at decay is determined in both decay channels from the charge of the final state kaon; contributions from suppressed B 0 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 amplitudes are negligible. The determination of the flavour at production is achieved by the flavour tagging algorithms which are described in more detail in Section 4.",

The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and pre-shower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The cut on the BDT classifier is optimised in order to maximise the significance of the B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + signal. Several input variables are used: the IP significance, the flight distance perpendicular to the beam axis, the vertex quality of the B 0 and the D \u2212 candidate, the angle between the B 0 momentum and the line segment between PV and B 0 decay vertex, the angle between the D \u2212 momentum and the line segment between PV and the D \u2212 decay vertex, the angle between the D \u2212 momentum and the line segment between the B 0 decay vertex and D \u2212 decay vertex, the IP and p T of the \u03c0 + track, and the angle between the \u03c0 + momentum and the line segment between PV and B 0 decay vertex.

In both cases the final state is similar to the signal, except for an additional neutral pion that is not reconstructed. This leads to two additional peaking components with invariant masses lower than those of the signal candidates. Therefore, for the measurement of m d only candidates with an invariant mass in the range 5200 m < 5450 MeV are used.",

The relative uncertainty on m d is 1.2%, where it is around 0.6% for m s [7]. Thus, the uncertainty on the ratio m d / m s is dominated by m d . As the systematic uncertainties in the m d and m s measurements are small, the error on the ratio can be further improved with more data.",
