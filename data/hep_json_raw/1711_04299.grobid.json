The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb \u22121 . The underlying event activity is quantified in terms of the charged particle multiplicity, as well as of the scalar sum of the charged particles' transverse momenta in different topological regions defined with respect to the Z boson direction. The distributions are unfolded to the stable particle level and compared with predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators, as well as with similar CDF and CMS measurements at center-of-mass energies of 1.96 and 7 TeV respectively.",

            "text": "The production of particles in a hadron-hadron collision includes contributions from partonparton scatterings, initial-state radiation (ISR), final-state radiation (FSR), and beambeam remnant (BBR) interactions. The large parton densities accessible in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC result in a significant probability of more than one parton-parton scattering in the same pp collision, a phenomenon known as multiple parton interactions (MPI). The combination of particle production from MPI (excluding the parton-parton scattering with the highest momentum transfer) and BBR interactions is commonly called the underlying event (UE). The UE usually produces particles at low transverse momentum (p T ) that cannot be experimentally distinguished from the particles produced from ISR and FSR. These processes cannot be completely described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, and require phenomenological models, whose parameters are tuned by means of fits to data.",

            "text": "The experimental measurement of the UE is often based on a process that defines the scale of the hardest parton-parton scattering, along with a phase space region with enhanced sensitivity to particle production associated with the UE activity. A number of measurements [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] have been performed by the Tevatron and LHC experiments at various center-of-mass energies, ranging from 0.3 TeV to 13 TeV, and using a variety of hard processes including events with high-p T charged particles or jets, Z+jets, and tt+jets. Measurements of the UE associated with different hard processes are useful to test the level JHEP07(2018)032 of universality of the underlying MPI dynamics. Events with a harder scale are expected to correspond, on average, to proton-proton interactions with a smaller impact parameter and therefore with more MPI [10]. Such increased UE activity is observed to plateau at high energy scales, which indicates that the smallest impact parameters have been reached and hence maximum matter overlap in the pp collision [11].",

Underlying event measurements based on Z boson production have been carried out previously at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [9] and 7 TeV [3,8] by Tevatron and LHC experiments. Z boson production is a process with a clean experimental signature and well understood theoretically, allowing clear identification of the UE activity. Measurements with Z bosons also make it possible to partially distinguish the MPI and ISR/FSR contributions [3,12]. In this paper, the properties of the UE are measured as a function of conventional observables related to the impact parameter of the pp collision, such as the number of charged particles and the scalar sum of their p T . The data are corrected for detector effects and compared to Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, as well as with earlier results at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [9] and 7 TeV [3]. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the data and simulated samples used for the validation and unfolding studies. Section 3 gives a brief description of the CMS detector, whereas section 4 describes the event and track selection criteria, and the observables used for quantification of the UE. The unfolding procedure and systematic effects are discussed in section 5, and the final results are presented in section 6. Finally, the analysis is summarized in section 7.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid, covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes based on three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and is located in the 3.8 T field of the superconducting solenoid. For nonisolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90 (45-150) \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [23]. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [24].",

            "text": "T . Because of the large spatial separation, the contribution of the hadronic recoil is small in the transverse region, and becomes even smaller in the towards region. The activity in the three regions becomes similar as p \u00b5\u00b5 T approaches zero; this observation again corroborates the hypothesis that differences in the UE activity for the three regions are due to varying parton radiation contributions. Unlike the UE measurement with leading jet/track [3,6], in the present analysis the UE activity is not zero when p \u00b5\u00b5 T approaches zero. This behavior reflects the fact that the initial scale in the Z boson events, given by the lepton pair invariant mass in the range 81-101 GeV, is already large enough to determine a significant overlap between the transverse parton densities of the colliding protons, and hence a large number of MPI. From the UE measurements using the leading charged particle (jet) approach [3,6], it is observed that the MPI contribution reaches its maximal value at an energy scale of 5 (12)(13)(14)(15) GeV. Above this energy, there is a slow rise in the number of particles produced, which is mainly attributed to the increase in the parton radiation contributions. In the present measurement, the minimum scale is set by the dimuon mass (81-101 GeV), which is larger than the energy where the MPI contribution saturates. Therefore, the increase in UE activity with p \u00b5\u00b5 T should be mainly ascribed to the rise in the recoil hadronic contribution and associated ISR/FSR [3].   sample, which uses herwig++ for parton showering and hadronization, overestimates the UE activity by 10-15% in all topological regions, whereas when pythia8 is used the measured distributions are reproduced within 5%. The MadGraph sample in combination with pythia8 also reproduces the measurement within 5%. The mc@nlo predictions (not shown in the figures) have the same level of agreement with the data as MadGraph. Color reconnection between the produced partons influences the multiplicity and p T of final-state particles. Its global impact in the measured UE observables is evaluated by comparing the pythia8 predictions with and without CR, and is found to be negligible.",
