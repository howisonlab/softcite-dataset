            "text": "The non-invariance of weak interactions under the combined application of charge conjugation (C ) and parity ( P ) transformations is accommodated within the Standard Model by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism [1,2]. The violation of the CP symmetry was discovered in neutral-kaon decays [3], and later observed with B 0 [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12], B + [13] and B 0 s mesons [12,14]. First evidence for CP violation in the b-baryon sector was found more recently [15]. The decays \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 are mediated by the same quark-level transitions contributing to charmless two-body B 0 and B 0 s decays to charged pions and kaons, where nonzero values of the CP asymmetries are well established [14]. The inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout.",

[32] and subtracting A K 0 D = (0.054 \u00b1 0.014)% [32] and the pion detection asymmetry. The momentum-dependent values are then weighted with the background-subtracted [40] momentum distribution of kaons from \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 decays to obtain A K \u2212 D = (\u22120.76 \u00b1 0.23)%, where the dominant uncertainty is due to the finite size of the samples used. The pion detection asymmetry is obtained in an analogous way, adopting the approach of Ref. [33], and is determined to be A \u03c0 \u2212 D = (0.13 \u00b1 0.11)%. A different approach is followed for the proton detection asymmetry, since no measurement of this quantity is available to date. Simulated events are used to obtain the reconstruction efficiency defined as the number of reconstructed over generated decays, in bins of proton momentum. Then, according to Eq. (5), an asymmetry is defined and weights are computed from the background-subtracted [40] proton-momentum distributions of \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays. The proton detection asymmetries for both decays are found to be equal, consistent with the fact that the kinematics of the protons for the two decays do not exhibit significant differences, as shown in Fig. 2. The common value is A p D = (1.30 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.65)%, where the first uncertainty is due to the finite amount of simulated events and the second is associated to the knowledge of the material budget of the LHCb detector. The third uncertainty is due to the assumptions made on the proton and antiproton crosssections used in the computation. The PID asymmetries are calculated using calibration samples with the aid of simulation to account for the limited phase-space coverage of the protons from \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The dominant uncertainty comes from different PID performances in data and simulation in the phase-space region where simulated events are used. This discrepancy has been studied us- Asymmetries related to different trigger efficiencies for the charge-conjugated final states may arise. The efficiency for a charged hadron to be responsible for the affirmative decision of the hardware trigger is determined as a function of transverse  [25]. The asymmetry of the software trigger is also studied using B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, determining the charge asymmetry of the fraction of B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays for which both final-state hadrons fire the software trigger with respect to those for which only one hadron fires. The total trigger asymmetries are measured to be A Several sources of systematic uncertainties associated with the fit model are investigated. The alternative models used to determine systematic uncertainties associated with the choices of the invariant-mass shapes consist in turn of: adding a Gaussian function to the invariant-mass resolution model used for signals and cross-feed backgrounds to account for long tails due to candidates with a poor determination of the final-state particles momenta; changing the value of the parameter governing the final-state photon radiation effects according to its uncertainty; substituting the exponential function used to model the combinatorial background with a linear function and removing the partially reconstructed background component by rejecting candidates with m pK \u2212 (m p\u03c0 \u2212 ) lower than 5.5 GeV/c 2 . When testing alternative models, 250 pseudoexperiments are generated according to the baseline fit model and using as input the central values of the baseline results. Fits are performed to each of the generated samples using the baseline model and then the alternative models. The mean and the root mean square of the distribution of the difference between the raw asymmetries determined by the two sets of fits are added in quadrature and the resulting value is taken as a systematic uncertainty.",
