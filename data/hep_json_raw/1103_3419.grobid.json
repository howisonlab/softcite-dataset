We determine M [h b (1P )] = (9898. Bottomonium is the bound system of bb quarks and is considered an excellent laboratory to study quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energies. The system is approximately non-relativistic due to the large b-quark mass, and therefore the quark-antiquark QCD potential can be investigated via bb spectroscopy [1].",

The natural widths of the \u03a5(nS) states are negligible compared to the detector resolution. The high-side tail is due to Initial State Radiation (ISR) photons. This latter function is analogous to the well-known Crystal Ball function [10] but has the tail on the higher rather than lower side. We thus refer to it as a 'reversed Crystal Ball' (rCB) function. The fitted M miss spectra from this band are shown in Figs. 1 (b)-(d), and the resulting yields, deviations of peak positions from world average values [11] and width parameters (\u03c3) of the rCB function for the \u03a5(nS) states are displayed TABLE I.
