Data were collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s = 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb-1. This analysis searches for W ^ bosons in the W^ \u2192 tb\u00af decay channel in final states with an electron or muon plus jets. The search covers resonance masses between 0.5 and 5.0 TeV and considers right-handed W ^ bosons. No significant deviation from the Standard Model (SM) expectation is observed and upper limits are set on the W^ \u2192 tb\u00af cross section times branching ratio and the W ^ boson effective couplings as a function of the W ^ boson mass. For right-handed W ^ bosons with coupling to the SM particles equal to the SM weak coupling constant, masses below 3.15 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. This search is also combined with a previously published ATLAS result for W ^ \u2192 tb\u00af in the fully hadronic final state. Using the combined searches, right-handed W ^ bosons with masses below 3.25 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Many approaches to theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) introduce new charged vector currents mediated by heavy gauge bosons, usually referred to as W ^ . For example, the W ^ boson can appear in theories with universal extra dimensions, such as Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM W boson [1][2][3], or in mod els that extend fundamental symmetries of the SM and propose a massive right-handed counterpart to the W boson [4][5][6]. Little-Higgs [7] and composite-Higgs [8,9] theories also predict a W ^ boson. The search for a W ^ boson decaying into a top quark and a b-quark (illustrated in Fig. 1) explores models potentially inacces sible to searches for a W ^ boson decaying into leptons [10][11][12][13][14][15].",

            "text": "For instance, in the right-handed sector, the W ^ boson cannot decay into a charged lepton and a hypothetical right-handed neu trino if the latter has a mass greater than the W ^ boson mass (mixing between W ^ and SM W bosons is usually constrained to be small from experimental data [16]). Also, in several theories be yond the SM the W ^ boson is expected to couple more strongly to the third generation of quarks than to the first and second gener ations [17,18]. Searches for a W ^ boson decaying into the tb\u00af final state1 have been performed at the Tevatron [19,20] in the leptonic top-quark decay channel and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in both the leptonic [21][22][23][24][25] and fully hadronic [26,27] final states, and the most recent results exclude right-handed W ^ bosons with masses up to about 3.6 TeV at the 95% confidence level. A previ ous ATLAS search in the leptonic channel [24] using proton-proton ( pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s = 8 TeV yielded a lower limit of 1.92 TeV on the mass of W ^ boson with right handed couplings. More recently, the CMS Collaboration reported results using a 13 TeV pp data set of 35.9 fb-1 [25], yielding a lower limit of 3.6 TeV on the mass of right-handed W ^ bosons. A search by the ATLAS Collaboration in the fully hadronic decay of the tb\u00af final state using 36.1 fb-1 of 13 TeV data yielded lower limits on the mass of right-handed W ^ bosons at 3.0 TeV [27]. In each of these analyses, the coupling strength of the W ^ boson to right-handed particles was assumed to be equal to the SM weak coupling constant. ton, ^, is either an electron or a muon. Right-handed W ^ bosons, denoted W R , are searched for in the mass range of 0.5 to 5.0 TeV. A general Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian is used to describe the cou plings of the W R boson to fermions as a function of its mass [29,30]. The mass of the right-handed neutrino is supposed to be larger than the mass of the W R boson, thus non-hadronic decays of the W R boson have a negligible branching fraction. In this weakly coupled model, the resulting branching fraction of the W R to the tb\u00af final state increases as a function of mass from 29.9% at 0.5 TeV to 33.3% at 5TeV.",

            "text": "The ATLAS detector at the LHC covers almost the entire solid angle around the collision point.2 Charged particles in the pseudo rapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 are reconstructed with the inner detector (ID), which consists of several layers of semiconductor detectors (pixel and strip) and a straw-tube transition-radiation tracker, the latter extending to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector provides four measurements per track; the closest layer to the interaction point is known as the insertable B-layer [31,32], which was added in 2014 and provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking performance. The ID is immersed in a 2 T magnetic field provided by a superconduct ing solenoid. The solenoid is surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting air-core toroid magnet systems. The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Elec tromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap highgranularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters, within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2. There is an additional thin LAr pre sampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. For |\u03b7| < 2.5, the LAr calorimeters are divided into three layers in depth. Hadronic calorimetry is pro vided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The forward solid angle out to |\u03b7| = 4.9is covered by copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are optimized for elec tromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. The muon spectrometer comprises separate trigger and high-precision track ing chambers that measure the deflection of muons in a magnetic field generated by the three toroid magnet systems. The ATLAS de tector selects events using a tiered trigger system [33]. The first level is implemented in custom electronics and reduces the event rate from the LHC crossing frequency of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz. The second level is implemented in software running on a commodity PC farm which processes the events and reduces the rate of recorded events to 1.0 kHz.",

The dominant background processes for this signature are therefore the production of W / Z +jets (jets aris ing from light and heavy partons), electroweak single top quarks (t-channel, Wt and s-channel), tt\u00af pairs and dibosons (WW, WZ, and ZZ).

These initial background normalizations are taken as starting values, and the final normalization is determined through a maximum-likelihood fit of the background templates to the data in which the background normalizations are parameters of the fit (described in Section 7).

            "text": "The background arising from multijet production consists of events with a jet that is misreconstructed as a lepton or with a non-prompt lepton that satisfies the lepton identification cri teria. The simulation of this background source is challenging as it suffers from large systematic uncertainties and does not reli ably reproduce the observed data in regions enriched with multijet events. Therefore the multijet background is estimated from data with the so-called matrix method, which is used to disentangle the mixture of non-prompt leptons found in the multijet back ground and prompt leptons originating from W / Z bosons [75]. This method uses a data sample, with loosened identification cri teria, dominated by multijet production and with a small contam ination of electroweak (EW) W / Z +jets production. The probability that a jet from multijet production which passes the loose selec tion also satisfies the tight selection criteria is estimated in this control region. The multijet purity in this sample is improved by subtracting, using MC simulation, the EW contamination to remove bias due to prompt-lepton sources. The efficiency for prompt lep tons passing the loose selection to also pass the tight selection is determined using tt\u00af MC samples, corrected using comparisons of MC and data Z \u2192 ^^ events. The number of multijet back ground events satisfying the selection criteria is estimated from these efficiencies using data events that satisfy all criteria, ex cept that loose lepton identification criteria are used. While this data-driven method is a significant improvement on the use of MC simulation, the low number of events and inherent systematic variations of the EW contribution lead to a significant systematic uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties on the multijet background are evaluated [76] using various definitions of multijet control re gions and by considering systematic uncertainties associated with object reconstruction and MC simulation. The uncertainty on this background is taken as 50% of the total rate and treated as uncor related between selected regions. Fig. 3 shows the distributions of the reconstructed invariant mass of the W ^ boson candidate for data and for background pre dictions in the 2-jet 1-tag VRHF and 4-jet 2-tag VRtt\u00af validation regions. Background templates are fit to data in each VR using the same statistical method as for the signal region except that the normalizations of tt\u00af and W +jets backgrounds are constrained to the post-fit rates obtained in the signal region (see Section 7).",
