In the neutral B meson sector, the mass eigenstates do not coincide with the flavor eigenstates as a result of BB mixing. In addition to measurable mass splittings between the mass eigenstates [3], the B s system also exhibits a sizeable difference in the decay widths \u0393 L and \u0393 H , where the subscripts L and H refer to the light and heavy mass eigenstates, respectively. This difference is due to the large decay width to final states accessible to both B 0 s andB 0 s . In the absence of CP violation, the mass eigenstates are also eigenstates of CP. The summed decay rate of B 0 s andB 0 s to the CP-even D \u00fe s D \u2212 s final state can be written as [4] \u0393B0",

Compared to theB 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s D \u00fe s decay, which is dominated by tree-level processes, theB 0 s \u2192 K \u00fe K \u2212 decay is expected to have larger relative contributions from SMloop amplitudes [4,33,34], and, therefore, one should not naively average the effective lifetimes from these two decays. Moreover, if non-SM particles contribute additional amplitudes, their effect is likely to be larger inB 0 [35]. The value of \u0393 L obtained in this analysis may be compared to the value inferred from the time-dependent analyses of J=\u03c8K \u00fe K \u2212 and J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays.

Effects due to the mass difference between theB 0 s and B 0 mesons are negligible. A tighter BDT selection is imposed to optimize the expected signal-to-background ratio, which results in signal and background efficiencies of 87% and 11%, respectively.
