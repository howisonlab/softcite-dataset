The scientific program with a high-performance detector such as KLOE covers several fields in particle physics: from measurements of interest for the development of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) in quark-confinement regime to fundamental tests of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and CPT invariance. It includes precision measurements to probe lepton universality, CKM unitarity and settle the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and to the fine-structure constant at the M Z scale.",

The test has been successful and presently DA\u03a6NE is delivering up to 15 pb \u22121 /day, with solid hopes to reach soon 20 pb \u22121 /day [1,2].

            "text": "KLOE is a multipurpose detector, mainly consisting of a large cylindrical drift chamber with an internal radius of 25 cm and an external one of 2 m, surrounded by a lead-scintillating fibers electromagnetic calorimeter. Both are immersed in the 0.52 T field of a superconducting solenoid. Peculiar to KLOE is the spherical, 10 cm radius, beam pipe which allows all of the K 0 S mesons produced in \u03c6 decays to move in vacuum before decaying. Details of the detector can be found in Refs. [4,5,6,7,8]. From 2000 to 2006, KLOE has acquired 2.5 fb \u22121 of data at the \u03c6(1020) peak, plus additional 250 pb \u22121 at energies slightly higher or lower than that. The \u03c6 meson predominantly decays into charged and neutral kaons, thus allowing KLOE to make precision studies in the fields of flavor physics and low energy QCD. The latter can also be addressed using \u03c6 radiative decays into scalar or pseudoscalar particles. Test of discrete symmetries conservation can be performed using several different methods. Most notably, CPT conservation can be tested via quantum interferometry measurements with neutral kaons, a technique which exploits the quantum correlation between the K 0 L and the K 0 S produced in \u03c6 decays. A collection of the main physics results of KLOE can be found in Ref. [9].",

In a first phase, two different devices (LET and HET) will be installed along the beam line to detect the scattered electrons/positrons from \u03b3\u03b3 interactions. In a second phase, a light-material internal tracker (IT) will be installed in the region between the beam pipe and the drift chamber to improve charged vertex reconstruction and to increase the acceptance for low p T tracks [11]. Crystal calorimeters (CCALT) will cover the low \u03b8 region, aiming at increasing acceptance for very forward electrons/photons down to 8 \u2022 . A new tile calorimeter (QCALT) will be used to instrument the DA\u03a6NE focusing system for the detection of photons coming from K L decays in the drift chamber. Implementation of the second phase is planned for late 2011. The integrated luminosity for the two phases, from here on dubbed as step-0 and step-1, will be 5 fb \u22121 and 20 fb \u22121 , respectively.",

Therefore, precision tests of the universality relations probe physics beyond the SM and are sensitive to several SM extensions [12,13,14,15]. A simple dimensional analysis argument reveals that deviations from the universality relations scale as \u2206 \u223c M 2 W /\u039b 2 , where \u039b is the scale associated with new physics (NP). Therefore, testing the universality relations at the 0.1% level allows us to put non-trivial constraints on physics scenarios at the TeV scale that will be directly probed at the LHC. Kaon physics currently plays a prominent role in testing both quark-lepton universality, through the V us entry in the CKM unitarity relation |V ud | 2 + |V us | 2 + |V ub | 2 = 1, and lepton universality, through the measurement of |V us | \u00d7 f + (0) and the helicity suppressed ratio \u0393 (K \u2192 e\u03bd(\u03b3))/\u0393 (K \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd(\u03b3)).

Using a phenomenological ansatz for the q 2 -dependence of the form factor one interpolates to q 2 = 0 where f + (0) is extracted, thereby introducing a major systematic uncertainty. A new method based on the use of partially twisted boundary conditions has been developed [39] which allows this uncertainty to be entirely removed by simulating directly at the desired kinematical point q 2 = 0.

Instead, the convergence of the SU(2) chiral expansion is much better and, thanks to the light pion masses reached in recent lattice calculations, the uncertainty related to chiral extrapolation to the physical point is kept at the percent level [47]; ii) little is known about the details of the chiral and continuum extrapolation in Ref. [42] (HPQCD) which is currently the most precise lattice prediction for f K /f \u03c0 ; iii) there is also some concern about the staggered fermion formulation used by MILC [40,41], HPQCD [42], Aubin et al. [45] and NPLQCD [46]. These results would have to be confirmed by conceptually clean fermion formulations. Therefore it is not obvious to decide which is the value to be used for f + (0) and f K /f \u03c0 . A dedicated working group, the FLAVIAnet lattice averaging group (FLAG), has just started to compile and publish lattice QCD results for SM observables and parameters. They have identified those published results demonstrating good control over systematic uncertainties. A first status report is given in Ref. [49].",

These data together with the value of |V us |/|V ud | from the measurement of the K \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u03bd(\u03b3) branching ratio [52] and the extraction of |V ud | from superallowed nuclear \u03b2 decays, provide the basis for testing the unitarity of the quark-flavor mixing matrix. A test of lepton universality and improvements of the bounds on NP scenarios have also obtained from the measurements of |V us | from leptonic and semileptonic decays.",

This experimental evaluation is completely independent from lattice estimates. Figure 1 shows the experimental results on f + (0) from the scalar FF dispersive measurements, using Callan-Treiman relation and f K /f \u03c0 = 1.189 (7). The value of f + (0) = 0.964(5) from lattice UKQCD/RBC is also shown for comparison. The NA48 result is difficult to accommodate and it violates the theoretical bound f + (0) < 1 pointing to the presence of right-handed currents from physics beyond the SM. The fit probability of the worldf 0 (t) data (excluding NA48) is 39% and the average is in good agreement with lattice calculations.

Due to the presence of the K*(892) resonance which dominates the decay distribution between 0.8 and 1.2 GeV, the vector FF dominates this decay except for the threshold region where the scalar form factor plays an important role. With the present accuracy the scalar FF cannot be determined from data and is thus taken as an input to the analysis.

The different precision results on \u03bb \u2032 + are in good agree- Table 4: Recent results on the slope \u03bb \u2032 + and the curvature \u03bb \u2032\u2032 + of the vector form factor in units of 10 \u22123 from the analysis of \u03c4 \u2192 K\u03c0\u03bd \u03c4 [81,78,79,80] and K e3 decays [20,83].",

At present, the sensitivity of the quark-lepton universality test through the G CKM measurement is competitive and even better than the measurements from \u03c4 decays and the electroweak precision tests [92]. Thus unitarity can also be interpreted as a test of the universality of lepton and quark weak couplings to the W boson, allowing bounds to be set on extensions of the SM leading to some kind of universality breaking. For instance, the existence of additional Z \u2032 gauge bosons, giving different loop-contributions to muon and semileptonic decays, can break gauge universality [12]. The measurement of G CKM can set constraints on the Z \u2032 mass which are competitive with direct search at the colliders. When considering supersymmetric extensions, differences between muon and semileptonic decays can arise in the loop contributions from SUSY particles [13,14]. The slepton-squark mass difference could be investigated improving present accuracy on the unitarity relation by a factor of \u223c2-3.",

This duality between space and its symmetry algebra is rather rigid and very sensitive to the introduction of new elements in the structure of the space. Galilei space-time and the Galilei algebra are linked by an analogous duality relation, and in going from Galilei to Minkowski space-time, thus adding the light-cone structure, one must replace the Galilei symmetries with the Poincare' ones. Similarly, we found that the additional space-time elements introduced by different proposals of the space-time quantization typically affect also the description of the symmetries. And indeed over the last decade or so the scenarios with broken Poincare's symmetries [118,119,120,121] or those alternatively introducing the novel concept of deformed Poincare's symmetries [122,123,124], have experienced a fast-growing popularity in the quantum-gravity studies.",

This ill-defined operator is a consequence of the foamy structure [136] of space-time, whereby the quantum metric fluctuations at Planck scales induce quantun decoherence of matter. The particle field theoretical system is an open quantum mechanical system interacting with the environment of quantum gravity. The reason for ill-defined CP T operator in such cases is of more fundamental nature than the mere non-commutativity of this operator with the local effective Hamiltonian of the matter system in Lorentz-symmetry violating SME models. Quantum-gravity induced decoherence is in operation and the very concept of a local effective Lagrangian may itself break down. R. Wald [137] has elegantly argued, based on elementary quantum mechanical analysis of open systems, that the CP T operator is ill-defined for systems which exhibit quantum decoherence, that is they are characterised by an evolution of initially pure quantum mechanical states to mixed ones. This was interpreted as a microscopic time arrow in quantum gravitational media which induce such decoherence. Hence such open systems are characterised by intrinsic CP T violation, a terminology we shall use from now in order to describe this particular type of CP T symmetry breakdown.",

As a result of the weak nature of quantum gravitational interactions, this ill-defined nature of CP T operator is perturbative in the sense that the antiparticle state still exists, but its properties, which under normal circumstances would be connected by the action of this operator, are modified [132,142]. The modifications can be perceived [143,144] as a result of the dressing of the (anti-)particle states by perturbative interactions expressing the effects of the medium. As argued in Refs. [132,142], the perturbatively ill-defined nature of the CP T operator implies modified Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlation among the entangled states in meson factories, which are uniquely associated with this effect, termed as \u03c9-effect.",

Indeed, in such models, inspired by string theory, the \u03c9-effect is the result of local distortions of space-time in the neighborhood of space-time defects, which interact -via topologically non-trivial interactions (string capture / splitting)only with electrically neutral matter string states, due to electric charge conservation. The recoil of the Planck-mass defect results in metric deformations along the direction of motion of the string state, g 0i \u223c \u2206k i /M P = \u03b6k i /M P , where \u2206k i = \u03b6k i denotes the momentum transfer of the matter state. On average, \u03b6k i = 0, so Lorentz invariance holds macroscopically, but one has non trivial quantum fluctuations \u03b6 2 k i k j \u221d \u03b4 ij \u03b6 2 |k| 2 . It can be shown [143,144] that as a result of such stochastic effects of the space time foam, neutral entangled states -such as the ones in meson factories -exhibit \u03c9-like effects, with the order of magnitude estimate:",

It is further assumed that possible CP T -violating effects beyond the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR) can be described at low energies within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). 1 This starting point together with a few mild mathematical assumptions immediately implies that CP T violation is necessarily accompanied by Lorentz-symmetry breakdown [134,135], a result sometimes called the anti-CP T theorem. In what follows, CP T and Lorentz-symmetry breakdown therefore can be treated on an equal footing. Note that the converse of this statement, namely that Lorentz-symmetry breakdown always comes with CP T violation, is not true in general. In the following we will discuss how the connection between CP T and Lorentz-symmetry breaking can be exploited for CP T -violation searches in neutral meson systems.",

For practical reasons, most of these observational results constrain SME coefficients for stable or quasistable particles (i.e., photons, electrons, protons, and neutrons) [177]. Experimental tests of CP T and Lorentz symmetry for unstable particles are more difficult, and the majority of the corresponding SME coefficients remain unbounded. The extraction of experimental limits for such unstable particles therefore assumes particular urgency.

The w\u03be formalism provides a convenient parametrization of \u039b that is independent of phase conventions, valid for arbitrary-size CP T and T breaking, model independent, and expressed in terms of mass and decay rates insofar as possible [178]. In this formalism, the CP T violation determined by \u2206\u039b is controlled by the parameter \u03be K . On the other hand, the usual parametrization of \u039b depends on the phase convention and can be applied only if both CP T and T violation are small. In this conventional parametrization, CP T violation is governed by the coefficient \u03b4 K . The relation between \u03be K and \u03b4 K is given by \u03be K \u2248 2\u03b4 K .",

This dependence on the direction is associated with Lorentz-invariance violation, in accordance with the above considerations involving the anti-CP T theorem. It thus becomes apparent that the standard assumption of a constant parameter \u03b4 K for CP T violation is incompatible with unitary quantum field theory. More specifically, the presence of the 4-velocity in Eq. 29implies that CP T observables will typically vary with the magnitude and orientation of the meson momentum. Additional effect is the motion of the laboratory: the CP T -and Lorentz-violating SME coefficient \u2206a \u00b5 is taken as space-time constant, and it is conventionally specified in the Sun-centered celestial equatorial frame. But Earthbased laboratories move with respect to this frame so sidereal (and in principle seasonal) variations of observables are possible. Thus, time, direction, and momentum binning is required for CP T tests in neutral-mesons systems. Moreover, different laboratories have different orientations in the celestial equatorial frame and hence can be sensitive to different components of \u2206a \u00b5 .",

Such effects need not necessarily be correlated across various particles species, so measurements in different physical systems are typically inequivalent. In the quark sector, neutral meson interferometry is currently the only precision method for CP T -violation searches. While various experiments have placed tight constraints on CP T breakdown in the K, D, and B d systems, only KLOE has been sensitive to all four CP T -violating SME coefficients, and KLOE-2 has the unique opportunity to perform a complete CP T test in the kaon sector.",

The complementarity principle was phrased by Niels Bohr in an attempt to express the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum physics. According to this principle, and in sharp contrast to classical physics, in quantum physics we cannot capture all aspects of reality simultaneously, the information obtained in one single setup being always limited. By choosing the setup, e.g. the double-slit parameters, and thus the quantum state under investigation, the predictability, i.e., the a-priori knowledge of the path is simply calculated (particle-like information), whereas the interference pattern (wave-like information) is observed by the experiment. In the case of pure state, the sum of the squares of these two quantities adds up to one, i.e., available information, particle-like and wave-like, is conserved. This principle has been investigated both in theory and experiment mainly for photons, electrons and neutrons propagating through a double slit or through an interferometer. The neutral kaon system is optimal for testing Bohr's complementarity: it is an interfering system with no need of experimental devices for effecting interference and at an energy scale not usually tested from other systems. Moreover, the CP violation makes these kaonic systems special. Via Bohr's complementarity relation new light can be shone upon CP violation by showing that it moves information about reality to other aspects without violating the complementarity principle, i.e., from predictability P to coherence V and vice-versa, as discussed in Ref. [181].",

The decision to erase or not the mark of the meter system -and therefore to observe or not the interference-can be taken long after the measurement on the object system has been completed.

In the first, the erasure of the \"which way\" information is fully-actively performed by an experimenter, i.e., choosing the appropriate experimental setup. In the second class erasure is obtained by a probabilistic process, e.g. a beam splitter. The erasure of the \"which way\" information is in this case partially active. Both options of erasure can be tested with the neutral kaon system. In addition, neutral kaons can be measured by a different, completely passive procedure. Herewith we obtain four different erasure options, two more than with usual quantum systems. An example of active measurement is placing a matter block into the beam for the determination of kaon strangeness from final-state particle identification. It is active because the experimenter chooses to measure the strangeness of the kaons during their time evolution and also the time when the measurement is performed. But there is as well the option of simply waiting for the kaon decay. If by chance a semileptonic decay is detected then the kaon strangeness is determined as well, without the experimenter's control on the mode and the decay time, with a passive-measurement procedure.",

In general all decoherence effects including CP Tviolation related to decoherence phenomena should manifest as a deviation from the QM prediction I(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; \u2206t = 0) = 0. Hence the reconstruction of events in the region \u2206t \u2248 0, i.e., with vertices close to the IP, is crucial for precise determination of the parameters related to the CP T violation and to the decoherence. The vertex resolution affects the I(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; \u2206t) distribution precisely in that region as shown in Fig. 6, and impacts the measurement of the decoherence parameter in two ways: i) reducing the sensitivity of the fit with respect to the accuracy expected from statistical fluctuations only; ii) introducing a source of systematic uncertainty. The major upgrade planned at KLOE-2 is the addition of the vertex detector between the spherical beam pipe and the drift chamber as presented in Sect. 1, designed to reach an experimental resolution on charged vertices of \u03c3 \u2206t \u2248 0.3 \u03c4 S . In Fig. 7, the statistical uncertainty on several decoherence and CP T -violating parameters is shown as a function of the integrated luminosity for the case \u03c3 \u2206t \u2248 \u03c4 S (KLOE resolution), and for \u03c3 \u2206t \u2248 0.3 \u03c4 S (KLOE-2 resolution with the inner tracker). The improvement on vertex resolution leads to an increase of the experimental sensitivity by a factor of two. The physics program concerning interferometry is summarized in Tab. 7, where the KLOE-2 sensitivity to the main parameters that can be extracted from I(f 1 , f 2 ; \u2206t) with an integrated luminosity of 25 fb \u22121  are listed and compared with the best published measurements.

The kinematic constraints applied to fully reconstructed final states have allowed KLOE to improve by a factor of ten the upper limit on this channel and to increase the sensitivity on the CP and CP T tests using the unitary condition (Bell-Steinberger relation) as explained in Ref. [202]. KLOE, with a K S tagging efficiency of about 23% and a selection efficiency on the signal of \u223c 25% has found 2 events to be compared with 3.13 expected by Monte Carlo simulation of the background sources. Since then, further improvements on the clustering procedure to recover erroneously-split photon clusters are proven to reduce contamination by a factor of six while leaving the signal efficiency unaffected. There are currently studies underway to evaluate the increase in acceptance from the installation of the crystal calorimeters (cf. Sec.1), and in the K S tagging efficiency resulting from the addition of the K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 sample to the events with K L interactions in the calorimeter used in the KLOE analysis.

The K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 amplitudes contain two terms, from inner bremsstrahlung, IB, and direct emission, DE. Due to the large contribution from low-energy photons collinear with pions, the IB amplitude is in general much larger than DE. The IB component is suppressed by CP -invariance for K L and by \u2206I = 1/2 rule for K \u00b1 , thus allowing the measurement of the DE term in these decays. Electric transitions only are allowed for the IB part, E IB , while the DE component can be separated into electric (E1) and magnetic (M 1) dipole terms [219,220]. Summing over photon helicities cancels out the interference between electric and magnetic terms. At lowest order, O(p 2 ), there is only the bremsstrahlung contribution. At O(p 4 ) both E1 and M 1 transitions contribute. E1 and M 1 are CP -allowed for charged kaons while CP -simmetry suppresses E1 transitions in the K L decays.

Both background sources can be safely removed by energy cuts and kinematic contraints coming from completely reconstructed final states. KLOE-2 can select a K S tagged sample of \u223c 3 \u00d7 10 8 events/fb \u22121 which corresponds to a total counting of radiative decays of \u223c 8 \u00d7 10 5 /fb \u22121 with at least 120/fb \u22121 events contributing to the interference. Since the dominant IB term, the interference and the contribution from counterterm combinations have a different dependence on E * \u03b3 so that a precision measurement of the photon energy distribution can disentangle the different components. Among other kaon radiative decays, accessible channels at KLOE-2 are the K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0e + e \u2212 , particularly the K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 mode.

With a preliminary analysis based on \u223c1 fb \u22121 , KLOE has obtained 974 cleanly identified events providing the BR measurement with a statistical error of 5%. Differently from NA48, negligible errors are related to the normalization which is done by K S tagging and K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 counting. The evaluation of systematics indicates they could be brought to the per cent level, so that KLOE-2 can reduce the error to 1%. The K S amplitude is dominated by the CP -even IB component needed to estimate the CPviolating term in the K L decay to the same final state. A test of the CP symmetry in this channel can be performed through the measurement of the angular asymmetry between \u03c0\u03c0 and e + e \u2212 planes.",

            "text": "In the case of \u03b7 \u2032 , it was argued that the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 can be related via \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 mixing to the isospin-conserving \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 decay and the ratio BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0)/BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0) gives the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mixing angle or the quark-mass difference [252]. This scenario has been recently criticized [253] and it was shown that the relation between the two hadronic decays is more complicated [238] and cannot be expressed by one mixing parameter only. The same work [238] emphasizes that a significant contribution to the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 from the \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 intermediate state and thus lower values of the r \u03b7 \u2032 ratio are expected. A fit to all data (until 2006) on rates and Dalitz plot parameters of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 hadronic decays leads to BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) \u223c0.01 [253]. Large contributions from \u03c1 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 should also manifest in the Dalitz plot distribution. The \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay has been observed by GAMS-2000 [254] on the basis of 62 candidates and an expected background of 34 events. The measured partial width of about 300 eV is very close to \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) but due to the different total widths for the contributions of isospin-conserving and radiative decays to the \u03b7 \u2032 , it leads to BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = 0.15%. The Dalitz plot slope is consistent with zero within large errors: \u03b1 = \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.3 [255]. GAMS-4\u03c0 has recently collected 235 \u00b1 45 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 events, obtaining the BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (1.8 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and \u03b1 = \u22120.59 \u00b1 0.18 [256]. In 2008, CLEO [257] has identified 20.2 +6.1 \u22124.8 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays corresponding to BR(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (37 +11 \u22129 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This result is much lower than predictions from Ref. [253], pointing to a smaller contribution than expected from the r \u03b7 \u2032 measurement. This is also confirmed by the relatively uniform Dalitz plot distribution found by the same experiment [257]. To solve this open question new data on \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 providing stringent constraints on all hadronic \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decays [238,231] are needed. In the first KLOE-2 run we expect \u22488,000 events produced. The experimental challenge in this case is the background suppression, mostly from \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 Fig. 10: Diagrams for the triangle and box anomalies.",

The box anomaly is a higher term of WZW describing the direct coupling of three pseudoscalar mesons with the photon (Fig. 10). The \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decays provide a good tool to investigate the box anomaly, which describes the notresonant part of the coupling.

Many efforts have been done to correctly describe contributions of the box anomaly to the two decays. Some examples, which have implemented unitary effects via final-state (FS) interactions, are: HLS, where the hidden local symmetries have been used to evaluate the WZW term [258]; the chiral unitary approach using Bethe-Salpeter equation [239]; the N/D structure matching the one loop corrections obtained with an Omnes function [259]. The \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decay has been measured in 1970s [260,261]. The analysis of the two data sets, 7,250 and 18,150 events respectively, shows some contradiction. Theoretical papers trying to combine the two measurements have found discrepancies in data treatment and problems with obtaining consistent results [258,262]. Therefore new measurements are needed to clarify the scenario. KLOE has collected 5 \u00d7 10 6 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decays. This sample allows a detailed investigation of the di-pion invariant mass distribution. The main background is due to the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , with a natural signal to background ratio (S/B) of 1/200. The energy resolution for photons is improved exploiting the kinematic contraints to the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decays, leading to a final S/B of \u223c 20/1 with a selection efficiency on the signal of about 60%. The preliminary analysis of 130 pb \u22121 provides 10 5 signal events. Studies are under way to finalize the selection procedure in order to obtain an efficiency as independent as possible from the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass and thus an accurate investigation of the box anomaly effect.",

            "text": "Pseudoscalar production at the \u03c6 factory (Fig. 11) associated to internal conversion of the photon into a lepton pair allows the measurement of the form factor F P (q 2 1 = M 2 \u03c6 , q 2 2 > 0) of the pseudoscalar P in the kinematical region of interest for the VMD model. The vector meson dominance assumption generally provides a good description of the photon coupling to hadrons but in the case of the transition form factor of the \u03c9 meson [265,266] where standard VMD fails in predicting the strong rise of the coupling in the (0.4 < M l + l \u2212 < 0.6) GeV region. Recently, a model for implementing systematic corrections to the standard VMD calculations has been proposed [267] which correctly describes the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 experimental results, and predicts deviation from standard VMD for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 decay spectrum. The only existing data on the latter process come from the SND experiment at Novosibirsk which has measured the M ee invariant mass distribution on the basis of 74 events [268]. The accuracy on the shape does not allow any conclusion on the models. The predictions can be tested with the analysis of KLOE and KLOE-2/step0 data, e.g., selecting the \u03b7 sample by means of the reconstruction of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays. This kind of procedure has been tested on a 90 pb \u22121 sample obtaining, as a figure of merit for the KLOE-2 reach, a clean sample with a selection efficiency of 15% which translates to 12,000 events/fb \u22121 .",

These decays allow the study of the \u03b7 meson internal structure, measuring the virtual- photon 4-momentum via the invariant mass of the lepton pair [275]. This is important for the connections with light-by-light physics [272]. In particular, the comparison of the kinematical distributions of the \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 e + e \u2212 to \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 e + e \u2212 can provide significant information on the underlying processes. These decays can also probe some physics beyond the SM: CP violation in \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 [276] and light CP-odd Higgs of the NMSSM (next-tominimal supersymmetric SM) in \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [277].

The \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay has been already studied with KLOE [273], which measured an asymmetry A \u03c6 in the angle between the \u03c0\u03c0 and ee decay planes consistent with zero to the 3% precision level, while theoretical predictions allow this quantity to be up to 2%. The largest contribution to the uncertainty of this measurement comes from the statistical error. In KLOE the minimal transverse momentum of reconstructed tracks, P Tmin , is 23 MeV. It limits the selection efficiency to \u223c8%. The installation of the inner tracker, in the second phase of the KLOE-2 experiment would reduce P Tmin to 16 MeV improving at the same time the tracking resolution, beneficial for the rejection of photon-conversion events mimicking the signal [273]. With a sample of 20 fb \u22121 and the increase in the efficiency from both acceptance and easier background rejection, KLOE-2 could obtain A \u03c6 with 0.8-1% precision.",

Big theoretical efforts to evaluate the BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) were originally motivated by the large branching fraction obtained by experiments dating back 40 years. ChPT terms [278]  At O(p 6 ) the counterterms of the chiral lagrangian can not be determined by experimental input only so that the prediction of the decay rate goes beyond pure ChPT constrained by experimental data. In Ref. [278] large N C expansion and resonance saturation were used to determine the O(p 6 ) LECs in the Lagrangian, obtaining \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = 0.18 eV. The contribution from a 0 (980) was also estimated, \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) a0 = 0.02 eV but the relative phase with respect to the VMD term is unknown. The uncertainty from the sign of the interference term is quoted as the dominant contribution to the theoretical error at O(p 6 ), \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 eV or BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (1.40\u00b10.14)\u00d710 \u22124 . Higher order terms in ChPT have been also studied, e.g. in Ref. [278] where all-order VMD counterterms have been added, obtaining \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (0.42 \u00b1 0.2) eV with the uncertainty again mostly from the sign of the interference term. On the experimental side, several measurements have been published since 1970s with smaller and smaller values of the branching fraction, decreased by three order of magnitude from 1967 to 1981 when the GAMS-2000 experiment measured BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (7.1 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . In 2005 the AGS/Crystal Ball collaboration has obtained an even lower value, BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (3.5 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , updated to BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (2.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22124 in year 2008 with a revised analysis aiming at the optimization of the selection criteria and fitting procedure of the experimental spectra. The prelimary KLOE result [279] is BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (8\u00b13)\u00d710 \u22125 , 1.8 -\u03c3 lower than the ChPT prediction at O(p 6 ) and 2.2-\u03c3 lower than the AGS/CB measurement. Using the KLOE preliminary result on the branching fraction and the analysis efficiency obtained of \u223c 5%, 1,300 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3 events are expected from the first year of data-taking at KLOE-2, thus allowing an accuracy of 3% . Moreover, KLOE-2 can provide the the m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution with sufficient precision to solve the ambiguity connected to the sign of the interference between VMD and scalar terms as shown in Fig. 15.",

The KLOE experiment has measured the branching ratio and the spectral function of the decays \u03c6 \u2192 S\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3, \u03c0 0 \u03b7\u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 [298,299,300] obtaining within the Kaon Loop phenomenological model the coupling of scalar mesons to the \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b7\u03c0 0 pairs. While in the latter only the a 0 (980) can contribute, in the \u03c0\u03c0 channel both, the f 0 (980), and the \u03c3 whose existence has been debated since a long time, are expected. KLOE has fitted the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 invariant mass fixing the parameters of the \u03c3 meson from other measurements and phenomenological fits. Data from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 phase shift were also taken into account. For the charged channel, due to the large background from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 dominated by the \u03c1 pole, no sensitivity to the \u03c3 meson is shown by the fit. The present analysis of KLOE data is based on \u223c500 pb \u22121 . KLOE-2 will have a 20 times larger sample, so that the \u03c3 could also show up in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel. Moreover, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 forwardbackward asymmetry (A F B ) is expected to be affected by the presence of the \u03c3. This asymmetry is generated by the different behaviour under C-conjugation of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 amplitude for initial state radiation (ISR) with respect to the other contributions (final state radiation (FSR) and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 (f 0 (980) + \u03c3) \u03b3. In Fig. 17 A F B is shown for two sets of KLOE data, collected at \u221a s = m \u03c6 and \u221a s = 1 GeV. In the second case no scalar should be present due to the low value of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 cross section. A combined fit to the invariant mass spectrum and asymmetry is of interest at KLOE-2 for the study of the properties of the f 0 (980) and \u03c3 mesons.",

Indeed, the available kinetic energy of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair is [0, 137] MeV, suppressing high angular momentum contribution. Furthermore, the exchange of vector mesons is forbidden by G-parity conservation. For these reasons, only scalar mesons can participate to the scattering amplitude. The decay can be mediated by the \u03c3, a 0 (980) and f 0 (980) exchange and by a direct contact term due to the chiral anomaly [230]. The scalar contribution can be determined by fitting the Dalitz plot of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 system. The golden channel for KLOE-2 is the decay chain \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The signal can be easily identified requiring the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 invariant masses. Such final state was already studied at KLOE to measure the branching fraction of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 decay [301]. The analysis efficiency was 22.8%, with 10% residual background contamination. With O(10) fb \u22121 , we expect 80,000 fully reconstructed events. Following Ref. [230] we have written the matrix element of the decay and built a MC generator. In Fig. 18 the m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution is shown with and without the \u03c3 contribution with the expected KLOE-2 statistics. Good sensitivity to the parameters of the \u03c3 meson is therefore expected from the study of this channel.  ",

Therefore the K L vertices are uniformly distribuited in a small region around the IP. Cuts on the vertex position are the most effective way to remove K S K L background.

The effective fine-structure constant at the scale M Z \u03b1(M 2 Z ) plays a crucial role in basic EW radiative corrections of the SM.

As M H , the mass of the Higgs boson, is the only relevant unknown parameter in the SM, important indirect bounds on this missing ingredient can be set by comparing the calculated quantity in Eq.(63) with the experimental value of sin 2 \u03b8 S . These constraints can be easily derived using the simple formulae of Refs. [315,316,317,318,319,320], which relate the effective EW mixing angle sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff (measured at LEP and SLC from the on-resonance asymmetries) with \u2206\u03b1(M 2 Z ) and other experimental inputs such as the mass of the top quark. It is important to note that an error of \u03b4\u2206\u03b1(M 2 Z ) = 35 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [321] in the effective electromagnetic coupling constant dominates the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction of sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff , inducing an error \u03b4(sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff ) \u223c 12 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (which is not much smaller than the experimental one \u03b4(sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff ) EXP = 16 \u00d7 10 \u22125 determined by LEP and SLD [322,323]) and affecting the Higgs boson mass bound. Moreover, as measurements of the effective EW mixing angle at a future linear collider may improve its precision by one order of magnitude [324], a much smaller value of \u03b4\u2206\u03b1(M 2 Z ) will be required as discussed in the next subsection. It is therefore crucial to assess all viable options to further reduce this uncertainty. The latest global fit of the LEP Electroweak Working Group, which employs the complete set of EW observables, leads at present to the value M H = 87 +35 \u221226 GeV and the 95% C.L. upper limit of 157 GeV (Fig. 19) [323]. This limit increases to 186 GeV when including the LEPII direct search lower limit of 114 GeV. Fig. 19: The line is the result of the Electroweak Working Group fit using all data [323]; the band represents an estimate of the theoretical error due to missing higher order corrections. The vertical bands show the 95% C.L. exclusion limits on M H from the direct searches.",

In the 1990s, detailed evaluations of this dispersive integral have been carried out by several authors [327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337].

Thus projects such as KLOE-2 are crucial for a better determination of the effective fine structure constant and the muon g \u2212 2 [306].",

As in the case of the effective fine-structure constant at the scale M Z , the SM determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is presently limited by the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization and, in turn, by our knowledge of the low-energy total cross section for e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons. Indeed, the hadronic leading-order contribution a HLO \u00b5 , due to the hadronic vacuum polarization correction to the one-loop diagram, involves long-distance QCD effects which cannot be computed perturbatively. However, using analyticity and unitarity, it was shown long ago that this term can be computed from hadronic e + e \u2212 annihilation data via the dispersion integral [377] ",

This cross section was extracted for \u221a s between 0.59 and 0.97 GeV with a systematic error of 1.3% and a negligible statistical one. More recently KLOE published a new measurement with larger statistics and a systematic error of 0.9% [379].

The BaBar data have been included in a new evaluation of the lowest order hadronic contribution to a \u00b5 : a HLO \u00b5 = 6955.0 (41.0) \u00d7 10 \u221211 [385]. The term a HLO \u00b5 can alternatively be computed incorporating hadronic \u03c4 -decay data, related to those of hadroproduction in e + e \u2212 collisions via isospin symmetry [337,386,Fig. 20: The pie diagrams show the fractions of the total contributions and (errors) 2 from various energy intervals in the dispersion integrals in Eqs. (64), (65). The diagrams for the LO hadronic contribution to g \u2212 2, shown in the first row, correspond to sub-contributions with energy boundaries at 0.6, 0.9, 1.4, 2 GeV and \u221e, whereas for the hadronic contribution to the effective fine-structure constant, shown in the second row, the boundaries are at 0.6, 0.9, 1.4, 2, 4, 11.09 GeV and \u221e. In the (error) 2 diagrams, the contributions arising from the treatment of the radiative corrections to the data are also included [378]. 387]. Unfortunately, even if isospin violation corrections are taken into account [388,389,390,391], the \u03c4 -based value is higher than the e + e \u2212 -based one, leading to a small (\u223c2 \u03c3) \u2206a \u00b5 difference [392]. As the e + e \u2212 data are more directly related to the a HLO \u00b5 calculation than the \u03c4 ones, the latest analyses do not include the latter. Also, recently studied additional isospin-breaking corrections somewhat reduce the difference between these two sets of data (lowering the \u03c4 -based determination) [393,394,392], and a new analysis of the pion form factor claims that the \u03c4 and e + e \u2212 data are consistent after isospin violation effects and vector meson mixing are considered [395,396,397].",

            "text": "The higher-order hadronic term is further divided into two parts: a HHO \u00b5 = a HHO \u00b5 (vp) + a HHO \u00b5 (lbl). The first one, \u221298 (1)\u00d710 \u221211 [344], is the O(\u03b1 3 ) contribution of diagrams containing hadronic vacuum polarization insertions [398]. The second term, also of O(\u03b1 3 ), is the hadronic lightby-light contribution; as it cannot be determined from data, its evaluation relies on specific models. Three major components of a HHO \u00b5 (lbl) can be identified: charged-pion loops, quark loops, and pseudoscalar (\u03c0 0 , \u03b7, and \u03b7 \u2032 ) pole diagrams. The latter ones dominate the final result and require information on the electromagnetic form factors of the pseudoscalars (c.f. Sect  [403,383], lie be-tween them. If we add the second of these two results to the leading-order hadronic contribution, for example the value of Refs. [382,383], and the rest of the SM contributions, we obtain a SM \u00b5 = 116591793(66) \u00d7 10 \u221211 . The difference with the experimental value is then \u2206a \u00b5 = a EXP \u00b5 \u2212a SM \u00b5 = 296 (91) \u00d710 \u221211 , i.e., 3.3 standard deviations (all errors were added in quadrature). Slightly higher discrepancies are obtained employing the values of the leadingorder hadronic contribution reported in Refs. [380,381] or [344]. Recent reviews of the muon g\u22122 can be found in Refs. [373,382,383,404,405,406,407,408,409,410]. Hypothetical errors in the SM prediction that could explain the present discrepancy with the experimental value were discussed in Ref. [411,412]. The authors concluded that none of them looks likely. In particular, a hypothetical increase of the hadroproduction cross section in lowenergy e + e \u2212 collisions could bridge the muon g\u22122 discrepancy, but it was shown to be unlikely in view of current experimental error estimates. If, nonetheless, this turns out to be the explanation of the discrepancy, it was shown that the 95% C.L. upper bound on the Higgs boson mass is then reduced to about 130 GeV which, in conjunction with the experimental 114.4 GeV 95% C.L. lower bound, leaves a narrow window for the mass of this fundamental particle.",

Figure 21 shows an up-to-date compilation of this data. The main improvements have been achieved in the region below 5 GeV: between 2 and 5 GeV (where the data are now closer to the prediction of pQCD), the BESII collaboration reduced the error to \u223c7% [339] (before it was \u223c15%); between 1 and 4.5 GeV BaBar measured various final states with more than two hadrons with a systematic accuracy between 5% and 15%, as shown in Tab. 15; below 1 GeV, the CMD-2 and SND collaborations at Novosibirsk, KLOE at Frascati and BaBar at Stanford measured the pion form factor in the energy range around the \u03c1 peak with a systematic error of 0.8%, 1.3%, 0.9%, and 0.5%, respectively. The CMD-2 and SND collaborations at Novosibirsk and BESII in Beijing were performing the hadronic cross section measurements in a traditional way, i.e., by varying the e + e \u2212 beam energies. KLOE, BaBar, and more recently Belle used the method of radiative return [418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425], as reviewed in Refs. [426,427].

            "text": "Cross sections of exclusive final states are also important for the spectroscopy of vector mesons whose properties provide fundamental information on interactions of light quarks. The \u03c9(1420), \u03c1(1450), \u03c9(1650), \u03c6(1680), and \u03c1(1700) have been found between 1 and 2 GeV [18] but even their basic parameters (M, \u0393, \u0393 ee ) are poorly known. The mass of these states is in satisfactory agreement with QCD which actually predicts three sets of vectors \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 from 1 to 2 GeV [428]. Recent studies of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 by SND [429] and BaBar [413] as well as e + e \u2212 \u2192 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 by CMD-2 [430] and BaBar [351], have significantly affected the \u03c9(1420) and \u03c9(1650) parameters. In the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state the cross sections measured by SND and BaBar are in good agreement at \u221a s < 1.4 GeV, whereas above this energy the BaBar cross section is more than two times larger than what previously measured by DM2 [431]. The estimated values of the leptonic width of the \u03c9(1420) and \u03c9(1650) states are significantly higher than what found in Ref. [428]. The \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700) are expected to predominantly decay into four pions. Various measurements of both 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 agree with each other [432,433,434,414] showing one broad structure only, while three interfering \u03c1's have been observed in the twopion decay of the \u03c4 -lepton [435]. A peculiar interference pattern or the existence of additional exotic states close to the regular qq states and mixed with them [436,437] can explain these results. It is also possible that the \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700) have different decay modes. BaBar has recently reported the observation of two structures at \u223c 1.5 GeV [417]. The broad one in the KK * state (width of 418 \u00b1 25 \u00b1 4 MeV) could be interpreted as the overlapping of \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700) mesons, but the one in the \u03c6\u03c0 0 final state with a smaller width of 144 \u00b1 75 \u00b1 43 MeV, should have a different origin. Its properties are very close to those of the C(1480) observed more than 20 years ago in \u03c0 \u2212 p collisions [438]. The \u03c6\u03c0 0 cross section also exhibits some narrow structures at 1.9 GeV, which could be the \u03c1(1900) earlier observed in the 3\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 \u2212 state photoproduction [439], in the total R at e + e \u2212 collider [440] as well as in both 3\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 \u2212 and 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 cross sections measured by DM2 [441] and BaBar [416] (although with a larger width). The statistical significance of these findings is not sufficient to exclude that an OZI-violating decay mode of the \u03c1(1700) was observed [416]. BaBar also reports clear evidence for the \u03c1(2150) meson in the \u03b7 \u2032 (958)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and f 1 (1285)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross sections [351]. Finally, BESII has recently reported evidence for a very broad (\u223c800 MeV) K + K \u2212 state at about 1.5 GeV produced in J/\u03c8 decays [442], with isovector quantum numbers which have been obtained from a partial-wave analysis. These measurements can hardly be reconciled with what was observed to both K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 L final states. Evidence for the \u03c6(1680) was only based on an old observation of the structure in the K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state by DM1 [443]. BaBar has recently confirmed the resonance in both KK * and \u03c6\u03b7 [417] modes while Belle has found it in the \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state [444]. There is, however, a conflicting result of FOCUS [445], which observes a structure with similar parameters in the K + K \u2212 and does not observe it in the KK * channel.",

How can this error be reduced? Let us consider the region around the \u03c1 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 threshold: i) the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 region between 0.5 and 1 GeV has been studied by different experiments. CMD-2 and SND have performed an energy scan at the e + e \u2212 collider VEPP-2M ( \u221a s \u2208 [0.4-1.4] GeV) with \u223c10 6 and \u223c4.5\u00d710 6 events respectively, and systematic fractional errors from 0.6% to 4% in the cross sections, depending on \u221a s. The pion form factor has also been measured by KLOE using ISR, and more recently by BaBar. KLOE collected more than 3.1 million events, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 240 pb \u22121 , leading to a relative error of 0.9% in the energy region [0.6-0.97] GeV dominated by systematics. BaBar has presented a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) cross section measurement based on half a million selected events. The pion form factor is obtained by the ratio \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3) which allows a systematic error of 0.5% in the \u03c1 region increasing to 1% outside; ii) the threshold region [2m \u03c0 -0.5 GeV] provides 13% of the total \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 contribution to the muon anomaly: a HLO \u00b5 [2m \u03c0 -0.5 GeV] = (58.0\u00b12.1)\u00d7 10 \u221210 . To overcome the lack of precision data at threshold energies, the pion form factor is extracted from a parametrization based on ChPT, constrained from spacelike data [447]. The most effective way to measure the cross section near the threshold in the timelike region is provided by ISR events, where the emission of an energetic photon allows the study of the two pions at rest. However at DA\u03a6NE, the process \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 with one missing photon is hundreds of times more frequent than the signal, and therefore a precision measurement requires an accurate evaluation of the background. Furthermore, irreducible background due to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 is also present while running at the \u03c6-resonance peak. The background issue can be largely overcome by taking data at \u221a s < M \u03c6 : KLOE has analysed about 200 pb \u22121 of integrated luminosity at 1 GeV and a new measurement of the pion form factor has been recently presented [448]. Figure 22 shows the statistical precision that can be reached in the region below 1 GeV with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 at 1 GeV for each bin of \u2206s = 0.01 GeV 2 . This luminosity leads to a statistical error on a HLO \u00b5 of a few per mill. The experimental systematic error could be kept at the same level (now is at 1%) by taking data at 1 GeV, where the background conditions (mainly from \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) which especially affect the threshold region, are much more favourable. The theoretical error, of the order of 0.6%, dominated by the uncertainty on the radiator function (=0.5%), could be reduced to a few per mill in the future. The dependence on the theory is much reduced by the measurement of the \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3/\u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 ratio where the main uncertainty on the radiator function and vacuum polarization cancel out in the ratio so that with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 at 1 GeV a fractional error of 0.4% could be reached.",

            "text": "The region [1-2.5] GeV, with an uncertainty on \u03c3 had of roughly 11%, is the most poorly known, and contributes about 55% of the uncertainty on a HLO \u00b5 and 40% of the error on \u2206\u03b1 (5) had (M 2 Z ) [306]. In this region BaBar has published results on e + e \u2212 into three and four hadrons, obtained with an integrated luminosity of 89 fb \u22121 [413]. KLOE-2 can improve both the exclusive and inclusive measurements. At 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 luminosity, a scan in the region from 1 to 2.5 GeV aiming at an integrated luminosity of 20 pb \u22121 per point corresponds to few days of data taking for each energy bin. By assuming an energy step of 25 MeV, the whole region would be thus scanned in one year of data taking. As shown in Fig. 23, the statistical yield would be one order of magnitude higher than what achieved with 1 ab \u22121 at BaBar, and better than what expected at BESIII with 10 fb \u22121 at 3 GeV. Figure 24 shows the statistical error on the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 channels which can be achieved by an energy scan of 20 pb \u22121 per point, compared with Babar published (89 fb \u22121 ) and tenfold (890 fb \u22121 ) statistics. The energy scan allows a statistical accuracy at 1% level for most of the energy points. In addition, KLOE-2 can benefit of the high machine luminosity and use ISR as well.  The energy scan for a precision measurement of the cross sections requires the knowledge of the energy of the beams circulating in the collider with a fractional accuracy of O(10 \u22124 ), i.e., \u223c100 keV at 1 GeV. Two well estabilished techniques exist: the resonant depolarization (RD) technique and Compton backscattering (CBS) of laser photons against the electron beam, as reviewed in Ref. [449]. The RD technique provides an accuracy of 1-3 keV and is based on polarized electrons, a requirement not easy to fullfil at the low-energy colliders and making in addition the energy determination a very time-consuming task. The CBS method is less accurate, but does not need of any special condition on the beams. For this reason, it seems more suitable for DA\u03a6NE. The measurement procedure consists of the acquisition of the order of 10 6 events providing an accurate determination of the photon Compton spectrum. In one acquisition hour at VEPP-4M [449] a statistical accuracy on the beam energy of 70-100 keV has been obtained with the CBS method. The simultaneous measurement of the energy of the scattered electron can be used to improve the precision on the beam energy. This is what has been done at the GRAAL beam at the ESRF machine in Grenoble. The GRAAL beam is a Compton-backscattered beam with maximal photon energy of 1.5 GeV (\u03c9 l = 3.51 eV, E e = 6 GeV), mainly devoted to photonuclear reactions [450]. At GRAAL the determination of the \u03b3-ray energy is achieved by tagging the scattered electrons which are separated from the primary beam by machine optics (bending magnets and quadrupoles) downstream to the laser-beam interaction region. The tagging detector consists of a silicon \u00b5strip placed in a suitable position along the machine lattice, and measuring the displacement of these electrons from the orbit of nominal-energy particles. From the displacement, the energy of the electron is inferred and thus the photon one. The advantage of this approach lies in the great accuracy of the position measurements of the silicon strip detectors. A precision in the energy beam to the 10 keV level was actually achieved with the \u00b5strip detectors [451].",

The region between 1 and 2.5 GeV is at present the most poorly known and is crucial especially for the hadronic corrections to the effective fine structure constant at the M Z scale. In order to improve the theoretical accuracy of a HLO \u00b5 the precision measurement of the hadronic cross section close to the \u03c0\u03c0 threshold is also required. In both regions KLOE-2 can give important contributions bringing the accuracy on a HLO \u00b5 to about 3\u00d710 \u221210 . The result can be achieved by measuring both i) the ratio \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3) with 0.4% accuracy at 1 GeV with ISR and ii) the hadronic cross section in the [1-2.5] GeV region with [1][2]% fractional error. This would represent a factor of two improvement on the error of a HLO \u00b5 , needed to clarify the 3-\u03c3 discrepancy in conjuction with the proposed muon g \u2212 2 experiments at FNAL [365] and J-PARC [452].",

            "text": "The ability of photons to probe such structure naturally depends on the photon wavelength. This is readily illustrated by looking at the integrated cross-sections from Mark II [457], Crystal Ball [458] and Belle [460,461] shown in Fig. 26 for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . It is worthwhile to consider these processes from the crossed channel viewpoint in which the photon scatters off a pion. At low energies the photon has long wavelength, and so sees the whole hadron and couples to its electric charge. Thus the photon sees the charged pions. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross-section is large and its value is a measure of the electric charge of the pion. In contrast, the neutral pion cross-section is small. However, as the energy increases the photon wavelength shortens and recognises that the pions, whether charged or neutral, are made of the same charged constituents, namely quarks, and causes these to resonate, as illustrated in Fig. 27. Thus both channels reveal the well-knownqq tensor meson, the f 2 (1270), seen as a peak in Fig. 26, with its production cross-section related to the average charge squared of its constituents.",

The three shaded bands delineate the energy regions where KLOE-2 can make a contribution discussed in the text. and when these are charged, the photons couple to these, Fig. 28. The intrinsic make-up of the state, whetherqq, qqqq or glueball, is obscured by the large coupling to the pions to which the \u03c3 decays. Data reveal a similar situation applies to the heavier, and seemingly much narrower, f 0 (980). This state has equally large hadronic couplings and is only narrow because it sits just belowKK threshold, to which it strongly couples. Experimental results discussed below suggest the two photons largely see its meson decay products too, regardless of whether the f 0 (980) is intrinsically aKK molecule or not [464,465,466,467,468,473,474,475,476,477].",

A key role is played by the general S-matrix properties of analyticity, unitarity and crossing symmetry. When these are combined with the low energy theorem for Compton scattering, these anchor the partial wave amplitudes close to \u03c0\u03c0 threshold [480,481,482,483] as described in Refs. [484,485,486,478] and so help to make up for the lack of full angular coverage in experiments. Crucially, unitarity imposes a connection between the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 partial wave amplitudes and the behaviour of hadronic processes with \u03c0\u03c0 final states. Below 1 GeV the unitarity sum is saturated by the \u03c0\u03c0 intermediate state, while above it theKK channel is critically important. Beyond [1.4-1.5] GeV multipion processes start to contribute as \u03c1\u03c1 threshold is passed. Little is known about the \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 channel in each partial wave. Consequently attention should be restricted to the region below 1.4 GeV, where \u03c0\u03c0 andKK intermediate states dominate. The hadronic scattering amplitudes for \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 andKK \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 are known and so enable the unitarity constraint to be realised in practice and in turn allow an Amplitude Analysis to be undertaken.",

The \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 coupling depicted in Fig. 30 is obtained assuming vector meson dominance: the \u03c3 meson decays to \u03c1\u03c1 with transitions  \u03c1-\u03b3 whose strength is described by VMD. The underlying dynamics in \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 is similar to \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 assuming [286] the \u03c3 as a bound state of two diquarks: the process is described by the tunneling probability for a quark to escape its diquark shell and bind with an anti-quark of the anti-diquark to form a standard qq meson. Running at \u221a s = M \u03c6 the electron tagger is essential to reduce the large background, mainly from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L , with the K L escaping from the detector and the K S decaying to neutral pions, K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The tagger is also important to close the kinematics of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0\u03c0 allowing a precise reconstruction of the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass (W \u03b3\u03b3 ). Leptons from \u03b3\u03b3 interactions, with E <510 MeV, follow a path through the machine optics different from the orbit of the circulating beams. The trajectories of these off-momentum electrons have been studied by means of a MC simulation, to evaluate their exit point from the DA\u03a6NE beam pipe and to find proper location for the tagger devices. This study is based on BDSIM [496], a GEANT4 extension toolkit capable of simulating particle transport in the accelerator beamline. Particles coming from the IP with energies from 5 to 510 MeV have been simulated with 0.5 MeV step. The results clearly indicate the need to place two different detectors in different regions on both sides of the IP: the Low Energy Tagger (LET) to detect leptons with energy between 150 and 400 MeV and the High Energy Tagger (HET) for those with energy greater than 420 MeV. The LET region is one meter from the IP, inside the KLOE magnetic field (Fig. 31). In the LET region the correlation between the energy and the position of the leptons is weak. For this reason the LET detector is a crystal calorimeter able to measure the electron energy with a resolution better than 10% over the range  MeV. The HET detector Fig. 31: View of one of the two LET detectors (the most external box) on the DA\u03a6NE beam-line.",

(71) The t-channel with quasi-real photons dominates the production cross-section, however in general the s and the interference contributions are not negligible. The two-photon decay widths of \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 can be extracted from the cross-section of the process (70), of interest among other issues to determine the pseudoscalar mixing angle and improve on the KLOE analysis of the gluonium content in the \u03b7 \u2032 , as discussed in Sect. 4.2.6. Moreover, the transition form factors F P \u03b3 * \u03b3 * (m 2 P , q 2 1 , q 2 2 ) at spacelike momentum transfers can be measured from the same process (70). They are important to discriminate among different phenomenological models, relevant for the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the g \u2212 2 of the muon [383,497].",

Assuming that the bulk of high energy quark loops is associated with pseudoscalar exchange, in Ref. [517,518,519] (10.7 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10 \u221210 is obtained. Taking into account these results, the authors of Ref. [402] quote as central value the one in [401] with the error as evaluated in Ref. [517,518,519]:",

In particular, imposing as many as possible short-distance QCD constraints [514,515,516,517,518,519,399,401] has already result in a better understanding of the dominant \u03c0 0 exchange. At present, none of the light-by-light hadronic parametrization satisfies fully all short-distance QCD constraints. In particular, this requires the inclusion of infinite number of narrow states for other than two-point functions and two-point functions with soft insertions [527]. The dominance of certain momenta configurations can help to minimize the effects of short distance QCD constraints not satisfied, as in the model of Ref. [401].",

The experimental data are summarized in Fig. 36. The region below 1 GeV 2 is still poorly measured and KLOE-2 can cover this region for both \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons.

A non exhaustive list of these observations includes the 511 keV gamma-ray signal from the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite [536], the excess in the cosmic ray positrons reported by PAMELA [537], the total electron and positron flux measured by ATIC [538], Fermi [539], and HESS [540,541], and the annual modulation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal [542,543]. An intriguing feature of these observations is that they suggest [544,545,546,547,548,549,550,551,552,553]) the existence of a WIMP dark matter particle belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the SM particles are uncharged. An abelian gauge field, the U boson with mass near the GeV scale, couples the secluded sector to the SM through its kinetic mixing with the SM hypercharge gauge field 4 The kinetic mixing parameter, \u03ba, can naturally be of the order 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 .  [504] while the other is from the F \u03c0\u03b3\u03b3 * (m 2 P , Q 2 , 0) expression given in Ref. [533]. Center: the \u03b7 transition form factor as measured by CELLO and by CLEO in the specified \u03b7 decay channels. Right: the \u03b7 \u2032 form factor as measured by CELLO and by CLEO in the specified \u03b7 \u2032 decay channels. The curves in the central and left panel represent the CLEO parametrization for the form factors [504].",

The condition m U \u226a m WIMP , where m WIMP is the mass of the DM naturally leads to an enhanced WIMP annihilation cross section in the galaxy, as required by the data. If the DM is also charged under a non-abelian group, higgsed or confined near the GeV scale, then its spectrum naturally implements an inelastic DM scenario [557], thereby explaining the annual modulation signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA [542,543] and reconciling it with the null results of other experiments [545,546,557,558]. In this case, there could be many particles, such as hidden sector higgs and gauge bosons or hidden sector mesons, baryons, and glueballs, with masses near the GeV scale.",

Moreover, the integrated luminosity of the B-factories is larger than that of DA\u03a6NE. However, the production cross-sections scale as 1/s, where s is the squared center-of-mass energy, which partially compensates for the lower luminosity of DA\u03a6NE. In addition, there are scenarios with a confined secluded gauge group, in which searches at DA\u03a6NE are easier than at the B-factories. A rather comprehensive discussion of these effects can be found in Refs. [559,560]. In particular, the authors of Ref. [560] explicitely discuss the physics potential of DA\u03a6NE. It turns out that a wide spectrum of physics channels can be studied with KLOE, with rather different detection potentials to the B-factories, as further discussed in Ref. [562].",

The constraints on the couplings of a new U (1) gauge group kinetically mixing with hypercharge from measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment (shaded regions) [579] are also shown. The dotted lines correspond to the lower bounds on the range of couplings that could be probed by a search at LEP for rare Z-decays to various exotic final states, assuming that branching ratios as low as 10 \u22125 can be probed. Original figures and more details can be found in [560]. This decay channel was already addressed in Ref. [563] in which the possible existence of a low-mass (\u223c10-100 MeV) U boson was postulated in the framework of models with scalar DM candidates [580]. The most relevant physics background comes from the QED radiative process with equal final state, which can be rejected by cutting on the invariant mass of the lepton pair [563]. A possible instrumental background that has to be taken into consideration for the electron channel is due to e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events with subsequent conversion of one of the two photons on the beam pipe, with a probability of \u223c2%, that is particularly relevant for low U -boson masses.

The background due to QED l + l \u2212 \u03b3 events with a photon lost by the calorimeter, is highly suppressed due to the high detection efficiency of this device. Moreover, this kind of background would give rise to a missing momentum equal to the missing energy, while in the case of the signal these two quantities will be sizeably different, due to the non-zero h \u2032 mass. In this case, differently from the one discussed above the key ingredient is the very high resolution of the DC as compared to the calorimeter one. A third advantage in terms of both background rejection and detection efficiency is that the leptons tend to be produced at large angle (the angular distribution of the process is proportional to sin 3 \u03b8, for m h \u2032 , m U \u226a \u221a s). Finally, for a wide choice of m U and m h \u2032 the trigger efficiency should exceed 90%.",

            "text": "in models with a confined sector, such as the one of Ref. [546], one has hidden sector quarks which can be produced through an off-shell U boson. The cross-section for this process can be very large, of O(pb) and larger as shown in Fig. 38 (bottom). Once produced, these hidden-sector quarks can confine into hidden-sector vector mesons, that can easily decay back to leptons, and hidden-sector scalar mesons that cannot, so that a possible resulting signal is multileptons plus missing energy. Recently, the BaBar collaboration has searched for 4 lepton events in the three possible channels, 4e, 4\u00b5 and 2e2\u00b5. A preliminary upper limit on \u03b1 D \u03ba 2 of order 10 \u22129 , slightly dependent on the W D gauge boson mass, has been set for M WD in the range [0.5-5] GeV [581]. We briefly discuss the implications for DA\u03a6NE of taking seriously the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation of DAMA/LIBRA and the null results of the other direct detection experiments [557,558]. In proposals to generate the iDM splitting among the dark matter states from new non-Abelian gauge interactions in a \u223c GeV-mass hidden sector, it is also natural to assume that scattering is mediated by the U -boson [545]. In such models, the signal rate and spectrum reported by DAMA/LIBRA constrain the couplings of the U to the SM electromagnetic current. This allows us to estimate the inclusive cross-section for production of hidden-sector states at DA\u03a6NE for a given iDM model. The expected cross-sections can be O(pb), at least for m U \u223c GeV. However, since the expected production cross-sections scale as \u223c m 4 U , very low-mass U 's may evade detection in existing data. The expected cross-sections are shown in Fig. 40. The coefficientC in these figures roughly measures the effective strength of the DM coupling to nuclei, and thus affects the predicted production crosssection at DA\u03a6NE. Also shown are the constraints on the couplings of a new U (1) gauge group kinetically mixing with hypercharge from measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment [579]. The green dotted lines correspond to the lower bounds on the range of couplings that could be probed by a search at LEP for rare Z-decays to various exotic final states, assuming that branching ratios as low as 10 \u22125 can be probed; m DM is set to 1 TeV. The upper plot, where m X = 0.2 GeV, the number of hidden-sector flavors, N f = 1, and the number of colors in the hidden sectors, N c = 3, shows various choices of C = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0}; in the bottom one, \u03b1 D = {1, \u03b1, 10 \u22124 } withC = 0.01. Note that the off-shell production crosssection scales linearly with the number of dark flavors N f and dark colors N c . On both plots constraints from a \u00b5 as well as the rare Z decay sensitivity region are also shown. The details involved in generating this figure are discussed in [560], to which we refer the interested reader.",

Specifically, we estimate the number of background events at given m 2 U by taking the shape of the background distribution and normalizing it to the PDG branching fraction. Given this number of background events (in a window of size determined by momentum resolution of 0.4% ), the value of \u01eb for which S/ \u221a B = 5 is plotted. We emphasize that this is only an estimate of possible reach, assuming 8 billion total \u03c6's. While it is simple to scale for different integrated luminosity, as the reach is proportional to L 1/4 , the actual reach requires detailed study fully including detector effects. Different choices of form factor significantly modify the reach near the upper end of the kinematically accessible range for m U , but have little effect at the low end. The kink in the curve just above 0.2 GeV is from the sudden drop in U \u2192 e + e \u2212 branching fraction when the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay mode opens up. At around : Reach for U \u2192 e + e \u2212 at KLOE in the process \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U . Top: KLOE reach in e + e \u2212 .

Therefore, relatively sizable contributions at higher order are expected. At O(p 6 ) the counterterms of the chiral lagrangian can not be determined by experimental input only so that the prediction of the decay rate goes beyond pure ChPT constrained by experimental data. In Ref.[278] large N C expansion and resonance saturation were used to determine the O(p 6 ) LECs in the Lagrangian, obtaining \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = 0.18 eV. The contribution from a 0 (980) was also estimated, \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) a0 = 0.02 eV but the relative phase with respect to the VMD term is unknown. The uncertainty from the sign of the interference term is quoted as the dominant contribution to the theoretical error at O(p 6 ), \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 eV or BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (1.40\u00b10.14)\u00d710 \u22124 . Higher order terms in ChPT have been also studied, e.g. in Ref.[278] where all-order VMD counterterms have been added, obtaining \u0393 (\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (0.42 \u00b1 0.2) eV with the uncertainty again mostly from the sign of the interference term. On the experimental side, several measurements have been published since 1970s with smaller and smaller values of the branching fraction, decreased by three order of magnitude from 1967 to 1981 when the GAMS-2000 experiment measured BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (7.1 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . In 2005 the AGS/Crystal Ball collaboration has obtained an even lower value, BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (3.5 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , updated to BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (2.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22124 in year 2008 with a revised analysis aiming at the optimization of the selection criteria and fitting procedure of the experimental spectra. The prelimary KLOE result[279] is BR(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3) = (8\u00b13)\u00d710 \u22125 , 1.8 -\u03c3 lower than the ChPT prediction at O(p 6 ) and 2.2-\u03c3 lower than the AGS/CB measurement. Using the KLOE preliminary result on the branching fraction and the analysis efficiency obtained of \u223c 5%, 1,300 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3 events are expected from the first year of data-taking at KLOE-2, thus allowing an accuracy of 3% . Moreover, KLOE-2 can provide the the m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution with sufficient precision to solve the ambiguity connected to the sign of the interference between VMD and scalar terms as shown inFig. 15.",
