            "text": "The total cross section for hadron production in e + e \u2212 annihilation is usually parameterized in terms of the ratio R, which is defined as R = \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons)/\u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), where the denominator is the lowest-order QED cross section, \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = \u03c3 0 \u00b5\u00b5 = 4\u03c0\u03b1 2 /3s. The measured R values are consistent with the three-color quark model predictions. At the open flavor thresholds where resonance structures show up, measurements of R value are used to determine resonance parameters. For the high mass charmonium resonances, the \u03c8(3770) was measured by MARK-I [1], DELCO [2], MARK-II [3] and BES [4] [5]; the \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) were measured by DASP [6]; and the \u03c8(4415) was measured by DASP [6] and MARK-I [7]. There were also some other measurements of R values as reported in Refs. [8,9,10], but no attempt was made to determine resonance parameters. The resonance parameters in the Particle Data Group (PDG)'s compilation remained unchanged for more than 20 years up to the 2004 edition [11]. The resonance parameters for the three high mass resonances were updated by PDG2006 [12], based on K. Seth's evaluation [13] using combined BESII [14] and Crystal Ball [10] data.",

We find that the results are sensitive to the form of the energy dependent total width, but not sensitive to the form of background. The DASP background function has six continuum production channels, while the effective interaction theory predicts different energy-dependence of the hadronic width for different decay channels. However in both cases the best fits give unreasonable results. This may be understood as the inclusive data can not supply enough information to determine the relative strength of different decay channels. To understand the detailed structures and components of the high mass charmonia states, it is necessary to collect data at each peak with sufficiently high statistics, and to develop more reliable physical models. This is one of the physics tasks of a tau charm factory, and might be further studied with BESIII that is under construction.",

In general the relative difference is within 3%, and for a few energy points the maximum difference is about 6%. Our results are in agreement with the previous experiments in most cases, but large differences are observed in some of the parameters, such as the mass of the \u03c8(4160). This is mainly due to the reconsideration of the radiative correction factors, and the inclusion of interferences between the resonances.
