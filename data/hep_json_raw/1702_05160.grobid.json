            "text": "We present a search for a light sterile neutrino using three years of atmospheric neutrino data from the DeepCore detector in the energy range of approximately 10 \u2212 60 GeV. DeepCore is the low-energy sub-array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The standard three-neutrino paradigm can be probed by adding an additional light (\u2206m 2 41 \u223c 1 eV 2 ) sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos do not interact through the standard weak interaction, and therefore cannot be directly detected. However, their mixing with the three active neutrino states leaves an imprint on the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations for energies below 100 GeV. A search for such mixing via muon neutrino disappearance is presented here. The data are found to be consistent with the standard three neutrino hypothesis. Therefore we derive limits on the mixing matrix elements at the level of |U\u00b54| 2 < 0.11 and |U\u03c44| 2 < 0.15 (90% C.L.) for the sterile neutrino mass splitting \u2206m 2 41 = 1.0 eV 2 .",

            "text": "Neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon in which a neutrino can be detected as a different weak eigenstate than initially produced after traveling some distance to its detection point. It arises due to the mixing between neutrino mass-and flavor eigenstates and existence of nonzero mass differences between the mass states. The effect is confirmed by a variety of measurements of neutrinos produced in the Sun [1][2][3][4][5][6], in the atmosphere [7][8][9], at nuclear reactors [10][11][12][13] and at particle accelerators [14][15][16][17]. The data from these experiments are often interpreted within the framework of three weakly interacting neutrino flavors, where each is a superposition of three neutrino mass states. However, not all data from neutrino experiments are consistent with this picture. An excess of electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam was found at the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) [18] and MiniBooNE experiments [19]. In addition, the rates of some reactor [20] and radio-chemical [21] experiments are in tension with predictions involving three neutrino mass states. The tension between data and theory can be resolved by adding new families of neutrinos with mass differences \u2206m 2 \u223c 1 eV 2 . However, the measurement of the Z 0 boson decay width at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider limits the number of the weakly interacting light neutrino states to three [22]. This implies that new neutrino species must be \"sterile\" and not take part in the standard weak interaction. The simplest sterile neutrino model is a \"3+1\" model, which includes three standard weakly-interacting (active) neutrino flavors and one heavier 1 sterile neutrino. The addition of this fourth neutrino mass state modifies the active neutrino oscillation patterns.",

This modifies the amplitude and energy of the muon neutrino oscillation minimum. The strength of the change is proportional to the amount of matter along the neutrino trajectory, and is therefore more pronounced for neutrinos crossing the Earth's core.

The properties of the refrozen ice, such as effective scattering length, change the angular profile of reconstructed events. This systematic uncertainty is treated in a similar way to the DOM efficiency. Ten discrete systematic sets with different effective scattering coefficients between 0.01 cm \u22121 and 0.033 cm \u22121 are used to determine a bin-by-bin effect of the refrozen ice properties on the event rate.

The best fit values for the standard neutrino mixing parameters are \u2206m 2 32 = 2.52\u202210 \u22123 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.541 (assuming normal neutrino mass ordering), which are different from the results of [30]. The best fit point for \u2206m 2 32 is now 1 \u03c3 lower compared to the previous measurement. Although the data set and analysis methods used in the two analyses are similar, there are a few differences responsible for the change. Since the publication of [30] the Monte Carlo simulation and event reconstruction have been improved. In particular, there is a new charge calibration used for the PMTs in simulation that leads to an update of the effective energy scale in the detector reconstruction. This leads to a change in the reconstructed position of the muon disappearance minimum, which is proportional to \u2206m 2 32 . A more stringent event selection is also implemented to improve atmospheric muon background rejection; however, the impact on the measurement of the atmospheric mixing angle is small (<0.3 \u03c3). Figure 9 shows the exclusion contours obtained in this study compared to a search performed by the Super-Kamiokande experiment [66], where the limit |U \u03c4 4 | 2 < 0.18 (90 % C.L.) is obtained. Using three years of Ice-Cube DeepCore data improves the world best limit on the |U \u03c4 4 | 2 element by approximately 20 % at 90 % C.L. The MINOS experiment also derives a constraint on |U \u03c4 4 | 2 < 0.20 (90 % C.L.) [67], however this limit is only provided for a single mass splitting of \u2206m 2 41 = 0.5 eV 2 . As there is no explanation of how that result scales with \u2206m 2 41 , it is difficult to compare with the results obtained with IceCube DeepCore.",

The dark (light) red dash-dotted lines represent the 90 % (99 %) C.L. exclusions assuming an inverted mass ordering (IO). The dashed lines show the exclusion from the Super-Kamiokande experiment [66].
