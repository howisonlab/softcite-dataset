An event-to-event comparison to air-Cherenkov measurements of the same air showers with the Tunka-133 photomultiplier array confirms that the radio reconstruction works reliably. The Tunka-Rex reconstruction methods and absolute scales have been tuned on CoREAS simulations and yield energy and X max values consistent with the Tunka-133 measurements. The results of two independent measurement seasons agree within statistical uncertainties, which gives additional confidence in the radio reconstruction. The energy precision of Tunka-Rex is comparable to the Tunka-133 precision of 15 %, and exhibits a 20 % uncertainty on the absolute scale dominated by the amplitude calibration of the antennas. For X max , this is the first direct experimental correlation of radio measurements with a different, established method. At the moment, the X max resolution of Tunka-Rex is approximately 40 g/cm 2 . This resolution can probably be improved by deploying additional antennas and by further development of the reconstruction methods, since the present analysis does not yet reveal any principle limitations.",

At higher energies the flux of cosmic-rays is too low to perform direct measurements with statistical significance. Consequently, the knowledge is poorer and relies on the measurement of secondary-particle cascades called air showers. These indirect cosmic-ray measurements use the atmosphere as a calorimeter. The energy of the primary particle can be estimated from the energy contained in the shower. The type of the primary particle can, for example, be deduced from the longitudinal shower development.",

Thus, the mass composition can be statistically estimated from measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, X max . Established air-shower techniques are the measurement of secondary particles on ground, the measurement of fluorescence or air-Cherenkov light by dedicated telescopes or nonimaging detectors on ground. The latter two methods have a relatively high accuracy for the energy and for X max , but are limited to dark and clear nights. Detection of the radio emission by air showers is an additional technique, which does not suffer from this intrinsic limitation of the exposure. The radio signal is sensitive to the shower energy [1] and X max [2][3][4][5], too, but it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally that the accuracy for both variables is competitive with those of the other techniques, as indicated by simulation-based studies, e.g., [6][7][8].",

The amplitude of this emission is proportional to the shower energy and to sin \u03b1, with \u03b1 the angle between the geomagnetic field and the shower direction. On a weaker level the Askaryan effect contributes, i.e., radio emission due to the time variation of the net charge excess in the shower front [10][11][12]. The interference of both effects leads to an azimuthal asymmetry of the radio footprint [5,13]. Finally, the refractive index of air causes Cherenkov-like effects for both emission mechanisms [14][15][16].",

Tunka-133 is fully efficient for all zenith angles \u03b8 \u2264 50 \u2022 at energies above 10 16.2 eV [18], which covers the full energy range of Tunka-Rex. For Tunka-133 measurements, the energy of the primary particle E pr is reconstructed from the flux of the Cherenkov light at 200 m distance to the shower axis, and X max is reconstructed from the steepness of the amplitude-distance function. Using these methods, Tunka-133 features an energy resolution of about 15 %, and an X max resolution of about 28 g/cm 2 [19]. For comparison, the average difference between the extreme cases of a pure proton and a pure iron composition is in the order of 100 g/cm 2 . Since Tunka-133 triggers Tunka-Rex, the same air showers are measured simultaneously with the air-Cherenkov and the radio detector.",

In the central area covering about 1 km 2 the spacing is approximately 200 m. The outer antennas contribute only to a few events (see figure 1). The air-Cherenkov array Tunka-133 covers the inner area with 133 photomultipliers, and features additional photomultipliers in the outer area. Upon a coincidence trigger of the photomultipliers, both the radio and the air-Cherenkov detector are read out in parallel. The electric field of the -2 - radio signal measured by Tunka-Rex is reconstructed in an effective bandwidth of 35-76 MHz. Details on the detector setup and its calibration can be read in reference [17]. The reconstruction of Tunka-133 is fully efficient and has a reliable reconstruction for events with zenith angles \u03b8 \u2264 50 \u2022 . Therefore, only events with \u03b8 \u2264 50 \u2022 have been selected for the present analysis (see figure 2). For these events the Tunka-133 reconstruction of the shower provides: energy of the primary particle E pr , atmospheric depth of the shower maximum X max , and axis, i.e., the direction and point of incidence on the ground (= shower core). For all Tunka-Rex events we used the shower core of Tunka-133 as input, because of the denser spacing of the photomultipliers compared to that of the antennas. The direction was only used as cross-check: events are considered false-positive, i.e., contaminated by background pulses and excluded from the analysis, if the directions reconstructed from the radio and air-Cherenkov arrival times deviate by more than 5 \u2022 [17].",

            "text": "For the selection of Tunka-Rex events we applied a quality cut based on the signal-tonoise ratio in individual antenna stations. The signal has to exceed a signal-to-noise ratio, SNR \u2261 (S/N ) 2 \u2265 10 in at least three antenna stations, where the signal S is the maximum of an envelope on the electric-field strength of the pulse, and the noise N the root-mean square of the electric field in a time window before the signal. This cut is set such that pure background has a chance of about 5 % to pass in an individual antenna, which balances efficiency and purity. Given 25 antenna stations, this leads to a non-negligible probability -3 - that in a true event antenna stations with false-positive signals are contained. To exclude most of these false-positive signals, we sort the antennas by their distance to the shower axis. After two antenna stations failing the SNR cut, any further antenna stations are excluded from the analysis for the particular event. Thus, the risk that an event is contaminated by a station with false-positive signal is reduced to approximately 10 %. If surviving falsepositive signals significantly impact the event reconstruction, they are removed by the cut requiring the 5 \u2022 agreement between the direction reconstructed by Tunka-Rex and Tunka-133. Thus, the remaining data set is assumed to be practically free of false-positive signals. Finally, for the X max reconstruction we apply additional quality cuts: at least one antenna above threshold has to be at a distance r axis > 200 m to the shower axis, since X max is reconstructed from the slope of the lateral distribution, which requires a sufficient lever arm. Moreover, the shower core has to be inside the central area of the array (dashed circle in figure 1), and the estimator for the statistical reconstruction uncertainty of Tunka-Rex must not exceed a certain value: \u03c3(X radio max ) \u2264 50 g/cm 2 . Reconstruction of the electric-field strengths (= amplitude) in individual antenna stations is performed with a modified version of the 'Auger Offline' software developed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration [26]. This software applies all known experimental characteristics to the recorded signals, in particular the frequency-dependent gain and pulse distortion of the various components in the signal chain as determined by calibration measurements [17]. For the reconstruction of the electric-field vector the simulated direction dependence of the antenna gain is used, which has been validated for a few selected directions by calibration measurements.",

(35, 40, . . . , 75 MHz), since these frequencies are often contaminated by RFI background. 1 Since the radio emission from the air shower is broadband, it is significantly less affected by the filter than the narrow-band disturbances. The background remaining after filtering still on average increases the measured pulse height E meas compared to the true pulse height E true , as already seen at the LOPES experiment [27] and assumed for early experiments [28]. We studied this effect by adding measured background to about 300 CoREAS simulations (figure 3), and found that the parametrization given in reference [27] has to be slightly modified introducing a normalization factor k = 4.1 adapted for Tunka-Rex. This normalization factor reflects the different ways how the noise level is measured in LOPES (mean of local maxima in the instantaneous amplitude) and Tunka-Rex (root mean square of the electric field, which corresponds to the mean power of noise). Thus, we use the following formula to correct for the average effect of noise:",

Most of the events used for the energy reconstruction are at energies above 10 17 eV. The fraction does not reach 100 % because some Tunka-133 events have small geomagnetic angles. Also, there were occasional technical issues in single antenna stations. For the high-quality events used for the X max reconstruction, the threshold is slightly higher: above an energy of about 6 \u2022 10 17 eV, all events used for energy reconstruction pass also the high-quality cuts required for X max reconstruction (see figure 5). Apart from technical issues (e.g., missing or malfunctioning antennas), the fraction shown in figure 5   reference is the fully efficient Tunka-133 trigger. The total number of Tunka-Rex events passing the quality cuts is larger [17], since in contrast to the air-Cherenkov detection, radio detection is more efficient for inclined air showers.

Our approach makes use of the fact that the asymmetry to first order only depends on the shower geometry, which can be reconstructed independently from the LDF by arrival time measurements. Based on CoREAS simulations made for the Tunka-Rex setup, the azimuthal asymmetry of the footprint is parametrized as function of the antenna position -7 -JCAP01(2016)052 using a constant typical value of \u03b5 asym = 8.5 % for the relative strength of the Askaryan effect. 2 Using this parametrization, we correct all measured amplitudes in individual antennas for the azimuthal asymmetry, and obtain a one-dimensional lateral distribution in which the amplitude depends only on the distance to the shower axis. Simultaneously, we correct for the relative strength of the geomagnetic Lorentz force, since this depends only on the shower geometry, too, namely on the geomagnetic angle \u03b1. Thus, we use the following equation to obtain the corrected amplitude E cor (r), which is later used to fit a radially symmetric lateral-distribution function:",

After this correction of the amplitude measured at each antenna station, the lateral distribution is approximately azimuthally symmetric around the shower axis. Thus, to first order the amplitude depends only on the distance to the shower axis r, and the lateral distribution can be fitted with a one-dimensional function the parameters of which depend on energy and distance to the shower maximum. Figure 6 shows an example event with many stations, where the asymmetry correction leaves the energy reconstruction almost unchanged, since the LDF fit averages the asymmetry out. However, the X max reconstruction is slightly improved for this event (Tunka-Rex X max is 613\u00b115 g/cm 2 and 621\u00b115g/cm 2 before and after correction, respectively, and the Tunka-133 X max is 657 \u00b1 28 g/cm 2 ).

Moreover, the shape of the lateral distribution depends mainly on the distance to the shower maximum and has two main features: first, a bump caused by Cherenkov-like effects [14,15,32,33], the existence, size and position of which depend on the distance to the shower maximum; second, an exponential tail [1,34], the slope of which depends on the distance to the shower maximum, too. This means that even a one-dimensional LDF should contain at least three free parameters: one for the energy scale, and two for the shape, namely the width of the bump, and the slope of the exponential fall-off. For this purpose we use the following lateral distribution function: amplitude at the axis distance r 0 . The shape parameter a 1 determines the slope of the exponential fall-off, and the shape parameter a 2 is related to the width of the Cherenkov bump. The distance parameter r 0 is a purely technical parameter. Using a minimizing chi-square fit, the shape of the function does not depend on the choice of r 0 , i.e, for different r 0 the resulting function is exactly the same, but just described with a different set of values for the parameters E r 0 , a 1 and a 2 . However, the choice of r 0 affects the uncertainties and correlations of the fit parameters, which is why a specific choice of r 0 can simplify the reconstruction of E pr , X max , and their statistical uncertainties. We set this distance parameter r 0 to 120 m for the reconstruction of the primary energy E pr based on E 120 , and to 180 m for the X max reconstruction based on a 1 , as these turned out to be the optimum values in the CoREAS simulation study.",

The shape parameter a 1 , i.e., the slope at 180 m axis distance is strongly correlated with the distance to the shower maximum. The second shape parameter a 2 is correlated with a 1 , and weakly depends on energy and zenith angle. Thus, fitting a 2 as a free parameter would complicate the reconstruction of X max significantly. For this reason we decided to perform the fit with only two free parameters, and to fix the parameter a 2 using a parametrization depending on zenith angle \u03b8 and the primary energy E pr (details in appendix A). After fixing a 2 , the LDF is fit to the data points. E 120 carries the whole sensitivity to the primary energy E pr , and the remaining free shape parameter a 1 carries the whole X max sensitivity of the LDF. Furthermore, reducing the number of free parameters in the LDF from three to two brings the additional advantage that we can use events with only three antenna stations above threshold (about half of the Tunka-Rex events in the present analysis).",

The simplification is to assume that the energy is exactly proportional to the amplitude, as expected for 100 % coherent emission. This means that the exponent b = 0.93 of reference [8] is set to 1 instead and, thus, is not present in the equation used here. The reason for applying this simplification is that with the present statistics and quality of the measured data, we have found no evidence for b = 1. Moreover, there is no significant difference in the resulting energy precision whether b is set to 0.93 or 1. Consequently, at the moment we lack experimental justification for introducing b as an additional parameter and decided for the simpler solution. The simplification requires a different proportionality coefficient \u03ba L , which has been determined with the same set of CoREAS simulations.

When combining both seasons, the average deviation between the Tunka-Rex and Tunka-133 energy values is (17 \u00b1 2) %, which is only slightly larger than the 15 % energy resolution reported by Tunka-133 [19]. Also for the position of the shower maximum there is a clear correlation between the radio and air-Cherenkov reconstructions (figure 8). Due to the stricter quality cuts the event statistics is lower than for the energy correlation. Still, the correlation is significant. This again indicates that also the reconstruction of X max works reliably for the selected, highquality radio events. Because of the lower statistics, the X max reconstruction precision of Tunka-Rex cannot be estimated very accurately. The standard deviation of the X max difference between both detectors is (47\u00b15) g/cm 2 , which reflects the combination of the unknown Tunka-Rex uncertainty and the Tunka-133 uncertainty of 28 g/cm 2 [19].

The derived Tunka-Rex precision is slightly better than 40 g/cm 2 , as expected from CoREAS simulations when including realistic background [8]. Since the average spacing of the Tunka-133 photomultipliers is half of the average antenna spacing, this result does not necessarily imply that the radio X max precision is in--12 -JCAP01(2016)052 trinsically worse than the air-Cherenkov precision.

However, the electromagnetic shower component is relatively well understood, and as estimated by other experiments [35], this uncertainty on the 'invisible' energy is only a few percent. Moreover, we assume that the CoREAS radio extension of CORSIKA simulates the absolute radio amplitude emitted by the electromagnetic shower component correctly, i.e., with errors which are small against the calibration scale uncertainty of 18 %, which is supported by recent experimental tests [17,36]. Still, the fraction of energy going in the electromagnetic shower component depends on the mass of the primary particle. Thus, the parameters in the method slightly depend on the assumed mass composition of the primary particles, in particular also the parameter \u03ba L determining the energy scale. For the present analysis, we determined \u03ba L as average of proton and iron simulations with the hadronic interaction model QGSJET-II.04 [37]. If we had taken a pure proton or a pure iron composition to determine \u03ba L of equation (3.4), the reconstructed energy would be 4 % smaller or larger, respectively.",

The Tunka-Rex scale uncertainty of 20 % roughly corresponds to that of AERA [38] and LOPES [36], which compared the radio measurements to air-fluorescence and particle measurements on ground. LOFAR as well features an absolute calibration of the radio amplitude with similar accuracy [40], but experimental checks of the energy accuracy are limited by the poor energy resolution of the LORA particle detector array [5]. For X max reconstruction, the resolution of LOPES has been significantly worse, using a simpler method in a more radio-loud environment than Tunka-Rex. The much denser array LOFAR is located in a more radio-quiet environment similar to the situation of Tunka-Rex. Its X max reconstruction is also based on CoREAS simulations using two different methods. With an X max reconstruction based on a fitted LDF (like in our approach), the precision of X max at LOFAR is only slightly better than our resolution [5]. However, with a more computing-intensive method using many simulations for each individual event [4], the precision by LOFAR is at least twice as good as ours. This indicates that in addition to the planned deployment of additional antennas, also further improvements in the reconstruction methods could increase the X max resolution of Tunka-Rex.",

The reconstruction methods have been developed and tuned using simulations with CORSIKA and its radio extension CoREAS. For both parameters we find a strong correlation between Tunka-Rex and Tunka-133 consistently in two seasons of data taking. This confirms experimentally that the radio measurements are indeed sensitive to energy and shower maximum. For X max this is the first direct confirmation based on a cross-check with a different, established experimental technique, namely air-Cherenkov measurements.",

The total scale uncertainty of Tunka-Rex is dominated by the uncertainty of the amplitude calibration, and in total is in the order of 20 %. This is comparable to the scale uncertainty of particle detector arrays, like KASCADE-Grande [45]. Since the calibration uncertainty dominates the total scale uncertainty of Tunka-Rex, any improvement in the calibration accuracy will directly propagate to the energy-scale accuracy. Consequently, further efforts on the calibration will be necessary to increase the accuracy to the same level as the currently leading fluorescence and air-Cherenkov techniques. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, the scale accuracy of fluorescence measurements is 14 % [35]. This now is in reasonable reach for future radio measurements, which unlike fluorescence measurements are available around-the-clock. Hence, radio measurements can be used to determine the absolute energy scale of air-shower measurements.",

The quality cut on events inside of the inner area (r < 500 m, dashed circle in figure 1) was discovered a posteriori by us, i.e., after we had frozen the reconstruction methods for the unblinding procedure.
