Uncertainties in the luminosity measurement at the LHC limit the absolute precision of cross section measurements and hence the ability to probe small differences in coupling strengths. It is therefore important to perform precise luminosity measurements and to explore different approaches to doing so. The challenge will be particularly daunting at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), where processes will be measured with excellent statistical precision, but under data-taking conditions where the mean number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (pileup or PU) is as large as 200.",

In this method, the Z cross section is measured at low instantaneous luminosities soon after the completion of the van-der-Meer (vdM) beam-beam scans that are used for absolute luminosity scale calibration [1]. The luminosity uncertainty will, in this period, mainly be the one on the normalization, typically about 1% -1.5% [2,3]. The muon efficiency can be assumed to be measured with a precision similar to that of the nominal Z cross section measurements performed under nominal data-taking conditions (see e.g. Ref. [4]). The luminosity in production running is then determined using the ratio of efficiency-corrected Z boson yields measured in the same fiducial volume as in the low instantaneous luminosity run. With this procedure the luminosity uncertainty is composed of two components:",

Uncertainties in the absolute luminosity scale are actively being improved. The LHCb collaboration has measured the absolute luminosity scale with a precision of 1.1% for their 8 TeV dataset. It is thus expected that uncertainties in the calibration transfer to nominal high pileup data-taking conditions will dominate the luminosity uncertainty. In particular, accurate calibration transfer requires that the methods used to measure the luminosity be highly linear, since the pileup values for production running can be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the pileup values employed during vdM scans. Another important source of transfer calibration uncertainty is long-term calibration drift, which can occur, for example, as the result of detector aging.",

This component can, for example, be studied in a data-driven procedure by embedding simulated hard-scattering events into a data sample recorded by minimum or zero bias triggers. The second is the modeling of the detector used to reconstruct simulated events in the collider experiments.",

The method exploits the excellent precision of luminosity measurements for low pileup data-taking periods and the correlation between uncertainties of muon efficiency measurements. Implementation of the method will require further detailed studies of muon efficiency uncertainties and relies on excellent understanding of lepton efficiency measurements using the tag-and-probe method. Similarly, the method can be used for any other physical production mechanism with sufficient rate and well studied reconstruction efficiencies.",
