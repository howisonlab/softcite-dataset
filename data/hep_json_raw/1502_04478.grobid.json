The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Decays of CP-even h bosons to \u03c4 \u03c4 or bb pairs with the Z boson decaying to electron or muon pairs are considered, as well as h \u2192 bb decays with the Z boson decaying to neutrinos. No evidence for the production of an A boson in these channels is found and the 95% confidence level upper limits derived for \u03c3 (gg \u2192 A) \u00d7 BR( A \u2192 Zh) \u00d7 BR(h \u2192 ff ) are 0.098-0.013 pb for f = \u03c4 and 0.57-0.014 pb for f = b in a range of m A = 220-1000 GeV. The results are combined and interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models.",

            "text": "The addition of a second Higgs doublet leads to five Higgs bosons after the electroweak symmetry breaking. The phenomenology of such a model is very rich and depends on the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets, the CP properties of the Higgs potential and the values of its parameters and the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs doublets with the fermions. In general, it is possible to accommodate in the model a Higgs boson compatible to the one discovered at the LHC. In the case where the Higgs potential of the 2HDM is CP-conserving, the Higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking are two CP-even (h and H ), one CP-odd ( A) and two charged (H \u00b1 ) Higgs bosons. Many theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) include a second Higgs doublet, such as the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [4][5][6][7][8], axion models (e.g. Ref. [9]) and baryogenesis models (e.g. Ref. [10]). Searches for a CP-odd Higgs boson are reported in Refs. [11][12][13][14].",

In order to suppress top-quark background, which is larger than in the bb channel, events are rejected if any of the following conditions is satisfied: there is a jet with |\u03b7| > 2.5; there are four or more jets; one of the b-tagged jets is the third-highest-p T jet. In order to select a sample for which the trigger efficiency is high, H T is required to be above 120 GeV (150 GeV) for events with two (three) jets. There are also requirements on the separation between the two b-jets in the \u03b7-\u03c6 space, R jj , to suppress Z + jets and W + jets backgrounds as described in Ref. [43]. As in the bb channel, the h boson is selected by requiring 105 < m bb < 145 GeV. It is not possible to accurately reconstruct the invariant mass of the A boson due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state. Therefore, the transverse mass is used as the final discriminant: 2 , where E bb T and p bb T are the transverse energy and transverse momentum of the b-jet pair system. As in the bb channel, the resolution is improved by scaling each b-tagged jet four-momentum by 125 GeV/m bb .",

In particular, the free parameters are the Higgs boson masses (m h , m H , m A , m H \u00b1 ), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets (tan \u03b2), the mixing angle between the CP-even Higgs bosons (\u03b1) and the potential parameter m 2 12 that mixes the two Higgs doublets. The Yukawa coupling arrangements distinguish four different 2HDM models, determining which of the two doublets, 1 and 2 , couples to up-and down-type quarks and leptons. In the Type-I model, 2 couples to all quarks and leptons, whereas in the Type-II, 1 couples to down-type fermions and 2 couples to up-type fermions. The Lepton-specific model is similar to Type-I apart from the fact that the leptons couple to 1 , instead of 2 . The Flipped model is similar to Type-II apart from the leptons coupling to 2 , instead of 1 . In all these models, the limit cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2192 0 is such that the light CP-even Higgs boson, h, has indistinguishable properties from a SM Higgs boson with the same mass. The cross sections for production by gluon fusion are calculated using SusHi [49][50][51][52][53][54] and the branching ratios are calculated with 2HDMC [55].

The cross section for the b-associated production uses an empirical matching of the cross sections in the four-and five-flavor schemes[56]. Cross sections in the four-flavor scheme are calculated according to Refs.[57,58] and cross sections in the five-flavor scheme are calculated using SusHi. The relative efficiencies for the b-associated and gluon fusion production as well as the predicted cross-section ratio are taken into account when deriving the constraints in the two-dimensional planes shown inFig. 4.

One muon is allowed to be reconstructed in the forward region (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.7)of the muon spectrometer, or to be identified in the calorimeter with p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 0.1[37]. The highest-p T lepton must satisfy p T > 20 GeV, and the second (third) lepton in p T order must satisfy p T > 15 GeV (p T > 10 GeV). Among all the possible lepton quadruplets in an event the one minimizing the sum of the mass differences with respect to both the Z and h bosons is chosen.Two different analysis categories are defined based on the lepton flavors in the Higgs boson decay: ee or \u03bc\u03bc (SF), and e\u03bc (DF).The expected background is very different in the two cases. For the SF channel, the background is dominated by Z Z ( * ) production with Z \u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc decays. For the DF channel, the main background is from the Z Z ( * ) process through the Z \u2192 \u03c4 lep \u03c4 lep decay chain, but other backgrounds are also important. The signal-to-noise ratio in the SF category is improved by using a set of requirements specifically targeted to suppress the main Z Z ( * ) background. First, a veto on the on-shell production of Z boson pairs is introduced, requiring the invariant mass of the h boson leptons to lie outside",

Furthermore, a requirement that the highest-p T lepton of the pair associated with the h boson has p T > 15 GeV is applied, since it is found to be effective against backgrounds from Z + jets production. The total acceptance times selection efficiency varies from 6.5% (1.5%) for DF (SF) channel for m A = 220 GeV, to around 20% for both channels for the highest A boson masses considered.",
