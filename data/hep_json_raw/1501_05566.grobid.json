The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. No excess of events is observed beyond the expected standard model background and upper limits are set on |V \u03bcN | 2 as a function of Majorana neutrino mass m N for masses in the range of 40-500 GeV, where V \u03bcN is the mixing element of the heavy neutrino with the standard model muon neutrino. The limits obtained are |V \u03bcN | 2 < 0.00470 for m N = 90 GeV, |V \u03bcN | 2 < 0.0123 for m N = 200 GeV, and |V \u03bcN | 2 < 0.583 for m N = 500 GeV. These results extend considerably the regions excluded by previous direct searches.",

            "text": "The non-zero masses of neutrinos and mixing between flavors have been well established by neutrino oscillation experiments and provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model (SM) [1]. The most compelling way of explaining the smallness of the neutrino masses is the \"seesaw\" mechanism, which can be realized in several different schemes [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In the simplest model, the SM neutrino mass is given by m \u03bd \u2248 y 2 \u03bd v 2 /m N , where y \u03bd is a Yukawa coupling of \u03bd to the Higgs field, v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value in the SM, and m N is the mass of a new heavy neutrino state (N). In this scheme, N is a Majorana particle (which is its own antiparticle), so processes that violate lepton number conservation by two units are possible. In this paper we describe a search for heavy Majorana neutrinos using a phenomenological approach [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. We follow the studies in Refs. [17][18][19] and consider a heavy neutrino that mixes with the SM muon neutrino, with m N and V \u03bcN as free parameters of the model. Here V \u03bcN is a mixing element describing the mixing between the heavy Majorana neutrino and the SM muon neutrino.",

SM neutrino ( = e, \u03bc, or \u03c4 ), from which limits on |V \u03bcN | 2 as a function of m N can be derived for Majorana neutrino masses up to approximately 90 GeV. More recently, the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC extended the search region up to about 200 GeV [22]. Several experiments have obtained limits in the low-mass region (m N < 5 GeV), including LHCb [23] at the LHC. The searches by L3, DELPHI, and LHCb allow for a finite heavy neutrino lifetime such that it decays with a vertex displaced from the interaction point, while in the search reported here it is assumed that the N decays with no significant displacement of the vertex. Precision electroweak measurements can be used to constrain the mixing elements, resulting in indirect 90% confidence level limits of |V \u03bcN | 2 < 0.0032 independent of heavy neutrino mass [24].",

The azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured in the plane perpendicular to the z axis, while the polar angle \u03b8 is measured with respect to this axis. Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. A two-level trigger system selects the most interesting events for analysis.",

Its magnitude is referred to as / E T . Jets are formed from clusters based on the anti-k T algorithm [39], with a distance parameter of 0.5, and are required to be within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. Muon candidates are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4 and to be consistent with originating from the primary vertex. Muon candidates are reconstructed by matching tracks in the silicon tracker to hits in the outer muon system, and are also required to satisfy specific track quality and calorimeter deposition requirements [29]. Muon candidates must be isolated from other activity in the event, which is insured by requiring their relative isolation parameter (I rel ) to be less than 0.05. Here I rel is defined as the scalar sum of transverse energy present within  [41] has been used. Further selection requirements are made based on two Majorana neutrino mass search regions. In the low-mass search region (m N 80 GeV) the W-boson propagator is on-shell and the final state system of \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 qq should have an invariant mass close to m W .

These requirements suppress contamination from W and Z boson decays. We also require the loose muon and jet to be separated in azimuth by \u03c6 > 2.5. This away-side jet is used as a tag and the loose muon is a probe used to determine the misidentification probability. The transverse energy of the tag jet is an essential ingredient to calibrate the characteristics of the probe (loose muon).",

In both the lowmass range (40 < m N < 90 GeV) and the high-mass range (m N > 90 GeV) the control region is the same as the signal selection, without the final optimized selections but with either missing transverse energy greater than 50 GeV or one or more jets that are tagged as originating from a b quark. In the low-mass control region we predict a total background of 51.4 \u00b1 1.9 (stat) \u00b1 8.3 (syst) events compared to an observed yield of 45 events, while in the high-mass control region we predict a total background of 87.6 \u00b1 2.5 (stat) \u00b1 12.3 (syst) compared to the observed yield of 81 events. The misidentified muon background accounts for about 2/3 of the total background in both regions.
