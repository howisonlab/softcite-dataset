New generations of experiments using advanced detectors at high-energy particle colliders perform measurements with a precision unprecedented in high-energy particle physics. This review summarises the major exciting experimental results measured at the highest energies and pertaining to the electroweak interaction. Comparisons with the theory, the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) [1], are used to test the theory and to constrain its free parameters. The data sets analysed for the precision measurements presented here have been accumulated at the world's highest-energy particle colliders over the last two decades. They verify the SM as a renormalisable field theory correctly describing nature.",

This centre-of-mass energy corresponds to the mass of the Z boson, the heavy neutral exchange particle of the electroweak interaction, which is thus produced in resonance, e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z. While SLC provided interactions at a fixed centre-of-mass energy corresponding to the maximum of the Z resonance cross section, the LEP-I collider provided collisions at several centre-of-mass energy points, thereby scanning the Z resonance lineshape in the range from 88 GeV to 94 GeV. By increasing the LEP center-of-mass energy up to 209 GeV (LEP-II, 1996, the precision measurements of Z-boson properties at LEP-I were complemented by measurements of the properties of the W-boson, the charged carrier of the electroweak interaction, in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 at LEP-II.",

            "text": "Proton-antiproton collisions are provided by the Tevatron collider operating at the Fermi Na-tional Accelerator Laboratory close to Chicago in the USA, at centre-of-mass energies of 1.8 TeV (Run-I, 1992-1996) and 2.0 TeV (Run-II, since 2001), and are studied by the experiments CDF [29] and D\u00d8 [30]. Results from the Tevatron experiments important for the electroweak interaction include measurements of the mass of the W boson, as well as the discovery of the sixth and heaviest quark known today, the top quark, in 1995 and the measurements of its properties, in particular its mass. In addition, key measurements were performed in dedicated experiments at lower interaction energies, notably the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [32], as well as the measurements of parity violation effects in atomic transitions [33,34,35], in Moller scattering [36,37] and in neutrino-nucleon scattering [38]. The following sections summarise the major experimental measurements of particular relevance to electroweak physics, starting with electronpositron collisions at the Z pole and above the W-pair threshold, the measurements at the Tevatron collider, and the specialised measurements at lower momentum transfer. The combined set of experimental results is compared to predictions based on the Standard Model of particle physics and used to constrain its free parameters. In particular, the predictive power of the SM and the precision of the electroweak measurements is elucidated by the predictions of the masses of heavy fundamental particles, such as W boson, top quark and Higgs boson, which are contrasted with the direct measurements of these quantities.",

These nine pseudo observables reduce to five under the assumption of neutral-current charged-lepton universality. The results of the four LEP experiments are compared in Figure 1.5; combined numerical results [69] are also reported in Table 1.1. The \u03c7 2 /dof of the combination indicates that the model describes the data well. The mass of the Z boson is determined with a precision of 23 ppm, and its total width with per-mill precision. Uncertainties due to the absolute and relative LEP beam-energy calibration [70] affect the averaged results on m Z and \u0393 Z at the level of 1.7 MeV and 1.2 MeV, respectively, showing how precise a LEP beam energy calibration was achieved. The measurement of luminosity affects \u03c3 0 had only. Both statistical and systematic uncertainties on efficiency and acceptance contribute to the total uncertainty on R 0 \u2113 , while the forward-backward asymmetries are still statistics dominated. Neutral current lepton universality is strongly favoured by the results for R 0 \u2113 and A 0, \u2113 FB as shown in Figure 1.6, where the contours for electrons, muons and taus largely overlap. Numerical results imposing lepton universality are also reported in Table 1.1.  ",

Distributions of several tagging observables [98,99,100,101,102,103,104], comparing heavy quarks samples with light quark background, are shown in Figure 1.13. The impact parameter is the distance of closest approach of a track to the reconstructed interaction point or primary vertex, and is thus large for tracks originating from the decay of long-lived hadrons. In case the secondary decay vertex is reconstructed, the siginificance of its distance from the primary production vertex is again large for long-lived hadrons containing heavy quarks. In case the decay vertx is measured, the mass of the decaying object is reconstructed using a pseudo-mass technique, and used to check whether it is compatible with a heavy objects. Semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons produce leptons with high total momentum as well as high momentum transverse to the jet containing the decaying hadron. As an example, the performace of the combined tagging algorithms used in the R b analyses is reported in Table 1.5 for the five experiments. The small beam pipe and low repetition rate of SLC allows the SLD experiment to employ detector systems reaching superior tagging performance. ",

These corrections are small, typically +0.0002 for R b and \u22120.0002 for R c depending slightly on the invariant mass cutoff of the qq-system imposed in the analysis. Corrections of similar origin have to be applied to the asymmetries, as even the data denoted \"peak\", taken at the maximum annihilation cross section, is at a \u221a s value slightly different from m Z while the asymmetries are strongly varying as a function of energy. These corrections on the asymmetries are summarised in Table 1.6. Table 1.6: Corrections to be applied to the quark asymmetries as A 0, q FB = A qq FB (pk) + \u03b4A FB . The row labelled \"other\" denotes corrections due to \u03b3 exchange, \u03b3-Z interference, quark-mass effects and imaginary parts of the couplings. However, for the asymmetries, the largest corrections are those for QCD effects, which are, in contrast to the case of partial widths, by construction not absorbed in the definition of the electroweak asymmetry parameters. The dominant QCD corrections arise from gluon radiation and depend on whether the jet axis or thrust axis is used to determine the polar angle in the analysis.

The asymmetry measurements are compared to the expectation as a function of \u221a s in Figure 1.17. Good agreement with the expected \u221a s dependence is observed. In a second analysis, the off-peak forward-backward asymmetry measurements are all transported to the \"peak\" centre-of-mass energy [69].

The results for the different charged lepton species agree well as expected from lepton universality. With this assumption, a combined value of A \u2113 = 0.1501 \u00b1 0.0016 (38) is obtained, where this average has a \u03c7 2 /dof of 7.8/9, corresponding to a probability of 56%.

The distributions of all three quantities are affected by the mass and total decay width of the W boson, allowing to measure these quantities. The transverse mass is always smaller than the invariant mass of the decaying W boson. It approaches the invariant mass when the W boson decay products lie in the transverse plane. This cutoff or Jacobian peak allows the W mass to be extracted from the position of the upper edge of the transverse mass distribution. The result is more precise than that derived from the other distributions. The transverse mass distribution also facilitates the measurement of the total width of the W boson. A non-zero total decay width effectively leads to a smearing, since the decaying W bosons have an invariant mass distributed according to a Breit-Wigner functional form. Since a Breit-Wigner falls off more slowly than Gaussian resolution effects, the number of W events with measured transverse mass above the nominal cut-off of m W depends strongly on the total width of the W boson.",

Typical events of each type are shown in Figures 1.32 to 1.35. The LEP experiments analyse all possible decay modes and event signatures. Hadronic events, W + W \u2212 \u2192 qqqq are selected with typical efficiencies of 85% and purities of 80%. Events must contain at least four well separated jets and no large missing energy.

Leptonic events, W + W \u2212 \u2192 \u2113\u03bd \u2113 \u2113\u03bd \u2113 are selected by requiring two acoplanar charged leptons, which rejects the main background arising from dilepton production, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 . Efficiencies ranging from 30% to 70% and purities ranging from 75% to 90% are achieved, where the lower values are obtained if both leptons are \u03c4 leptons and the higher values if both leptons are electrons or muons. Semi-leptonic events, W + W \u2212 \u2192 qq\u2113\u03bd \u2113 , are tagged by the presence of a high-energy charged lepton. In addition, events must contain two hadronic jets and missing energy due to the neutrino. The main background arises through inclusive lepton production in qq events, where the missing energy is given by initialstate radiative photons lost in the beam pipe. Semi-leptonic events are selected with an efficiency between 30% and 90% and a purity between 70% and 95%, where the lower values are obtained for qq\u03c4 \u03bd events and the higher values for qqe\u03bd e and qq\u00b5\u03bd events.",

Especially at higher energies, the influence of the s-channel Feynman diagrams is clearly visible, establishing qualitatively as well as quantitativley the \u03b3WW and ZWW triplegauge-boson couplings of the electroweak interaction. Combining all energy points, the ratio of measurement to theory is determined to be 0.995 \u00b1 0.009, a successfull precision test of the theory [156].   The comparison of the branching fractions of W decay, determined for the three leptonic modes and the inclusive hadronic mode, is shown in Figure 1.37. In general, good agreement is observed between the results of the four experiments. The combined results [156] agree well with the SM expectation except in the case of W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays, where all experiments measured a branching fraction higher than expected. The combination under assumption of lepton universality also agrees with the expectation, because the electron and muon decay modes are measured to be slightly smaller than expected.

However, at higher centre-of-mass energies, the cross section flattens out and becomes independent of m W . At these energies, where the bulk of the LEP-II luminosity was collected, the method of direct reconstruction is most sensitive in determining the mass and also the total width of the W boson. The four fermions arising in W-pair decay are reconstructed in the detector, in particluar energy and direction, and paired to form two W bosons. The invariant mass of each paired fermion system corresponds to the invariant mass of the decaying W boson, and follows a Breit-Wigner distribution convoluted with the detector resolution. A kinematic fit of the measured energies and angles, enforcing a 4-fermion final state, overall energy-momentum conservation as well as equal mass of the two W bosons in an event, is performed. Such a procedure allows the determination of the unmeasured neutrino kinematics in qq\u2113\u03bd \u2113 events and improves the resolutions in the kinematics of the measured fermions by a factor of up to four. Spectra of reconstructed invariant masses are shown in Figure 1.38. The W-mass peak around 80 GeV is clearly visible. Its width is given by the total decay width of the W boson and the detector resolution. These distributions are analysed by the four LEP experiments in order to extract the pole mass and total decay width of the W boson [161,162,163,164], where a definition of mass and width using a Breit-Wigner with s-dependent width is used.

            "text": "where the two results show a correlation of 20%. Systematic uncertainties affecting the mass measurements are compared in Table 1.21. The largest systematic uncertainty affecting both channels arises from the uncertainty in the modeling of quark fragmentation and hadronisation. In addition, the hadronic channel suffers from additional sources of uncertainty, which are related to the fact that the two hadronic W-boson decays strongly overlap in space-time. Thus, cross talk between the two hadronic system arising through the strong interaction may lead to four-momentum exchange between them so that the invariant masses of the  visible decay products measured in the detector can not be attributed uniquely to one of the two decaying W bosons. Such FSI effects can arise due to (i) Bose-Einstein correlations (BE) between identical neutral hadrons, mainly pions, or (ii) colour-reconnection effects (CR) in the perturbative or non-perturbative evolution of the qq systems originating from the two W bosons. Dedicated studies are performed to analyse in detail particle correlations and the particle and energy flow in qqqq events between jets to search for BE and CR effects. In case of BE, the effects within a jet are measured to be at the same strength as observed between jets from Z boson decay, excluding b quarks as these are suppressed in W decays. Of relevance for the W mass, however, is the strength of inter-W BE. These are measured by com-paring genuine W + W \u2212 \u2192 qqqq with two combined W + W \u2212 \u2192 qq\u2113\u03bd \u2113 events where the leptons are removed. The mixed events properly contain the intra-W correlations while inter-W correlations are absent. Hence any difference to W + W \u2212 \u2192 qqqq events must be attributed to inter-W correlations. The analyses of the LEP experiments result in a combined limit of 30% in the data on the strength of a model describing such BE correlations in the Monte Carlo simulation [156]. This limit is turned into a systematic uncertainty on the mass of the W boson using the same model. A similar strategy is followed in limiting possible CR effects. Again, for the W mass reconstruction, only inter-W effects are relevant since intra-W effects do not change the invariant mass of a hadronic system. To limit CR, the particle flow in W + W \u2212 \u2192 qqqq between jets from the same W boson is compared to that between jets from different W bosons. Interpreting the particle flow with the help of CR models allows to constrain model parameters, for example limiting the model parameter k i describing CR in the SK-I model to a value of at most 2.13 combining the LEP analyses [156]. The consequences for the mass are then evaluated using the same SK-I model, comparing k i = 0 with k i = 2.13.",

These leptons are easy to identify in the hadronic event environment and constitute an important selection tool; the more leptons, the higher the efficiency and purity. The common signature of all tt events consists of the bb system; hence in several tt analyses b-tagging is explicitely used in the event selection. On the balance of branching fraction, efficiency and purity of the selected sample, the semileptonic channel offers best prospects for high precision measurements of top-quark properties. Electroweak single-top production, a charged weak current process mediated by W-boson echange, has an expected cross section only slightly smaller than tt production, a strong process. However, single-top production is much harder to observe experimentally, as only one heavy top quark is produced. Only very recently, first evidence for single-top production has been reported by D\u00d8 and also found by CDF [167,168]. For a robust and precise mass measurement, large samples top quarks must be selected with high efficiency and purity. Hence, for the study of top-quark properties such as its mass, tt events are used.",

The number of combinations can be reduced by using b-tagging to identify the two b jets among the six jets, and by a matrix-element based probability assignment to find the most likely combination representing a tt decay.

Some old physics effects are: theoretical uncertainties in PDFs, iso-spin violating PDFs, quark-antiquark asymmetries for sea quarks, nuclear shadowing asymmetries between W and Z interactions, etc. Some new physics effects are: a new heavy Z boson, contact interactions, leptoquarks, new fermions, neutrinos oscillations, etc. Most of the old and new physics effects are, however, severely constrained by NuTeV itself or other precision electroweak measurements, thus cannot explain the full effect. It seems, however, that PDF uncertainties should be investigated, and in particular the partly leading-order analysis employed by NuTeV should be assessed and eventually improved to next-to-leading order.",

The muon decays through the charged weak current into an electron and two neutrinos. Because of the parity violation of the charged weak current, the muon spin is correlated with the direction of flight of the electron. This correlation allows the muon spin to be measured by observing the electron signal at a fixed direction from the muon beam. The E821 experiment used 24 electromagnetic calorimeters, placed symmetrically along the inside of the storage ring, to measure the time of the muon decay and the decay electron energy.

Since the SM calculation is sensitive to the full particle content of the theory through loops of virtual particles, any measured excess could indicate the existence of new particles not found so far. Typical diagrams contributing to the calculation are shown in Figure 1.49, and are classified as pure QED, weak, hadronic and light-by-light diagrams. The pure QED contribution is by far the dominant term but known extremely precisely [186,187]. The weak [188], hadronic [189,190,191] and light-by-light [188] contributions are all much smaller but have larger uncertainties. Adding all contributions, the error on the SM calculations [189,190,191] is dominated by the leading-order hadronic contribution (6-7 units, depending on calculation), followed by the hadronic light-by-light contribution (3.5 units).

The fit has a \u03c7 2 /dof of 16.0/10, corresponding to a probability of 9.9%. The results of the fit are reported in Table 1.22. The fitted hadronic vacuum polarisation is nearly unchanged compared to the input measurement Equation 59, showing that the data has only a low sensitivity to it. However, the parameter is crucial in the determination of the mass of the Higgs boson as evidenced from the sizeable correlation coefficient of 0.89. The fitted strong coupling constant is one of the most precise determination of this quantity, and in good agreement with other determinations [206,184]. The mass of the Z boson in this SM analysis is identical to that derived in the model-independent analysis of Section 1.2, but now m Z changed its role to a parameter of the theory, in terms of which all other observables are calculated. Even though Z-pole radiative corrections are sensitive to log 10 (m H /GeV) only, the mass of the Higgs boson is nevertheless constrained within a factor of two and lies in the region below 1 TeV as required by theory, showing the self-consistency of this analysis.",

In general, the many precise results presented here are in good agreement with the SM expectations, thus contraining any hypothetical theories beyond it. The notable exceptions, all at the level of about three standard deviations, are: (i) the (final) forward-backward asymmetry in e + e \u2212 \u2192 bb measured at the Z pole, (ii) the (still preliminary) leptonic W-decay branching fractions measured in e + e \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 at LEP-II, and (iii) the left-handed quark couplings combination measured in neutrino-nucleon scattering by the NuTeV experiment. While the first two are likely to be of statistical nature, the last one may also be explained through an improved theoretical understanding of hadronic physics inside the atomic nucleus. The precision measurements test the theory at loop level, verifying the SM as a renormalisable field theory correctly describing nature. The data impose very tight constraints on any new physics beyond the SM. Any extended theory must be consistent with the SM or one or more Higgs doublet models such as super-symmetry. Masses of heavy fundamental particles are predicted from the analysis of reactions where these particles are not directly produced but occur as virtual particles in loops contributing to the process under study. The predictions of W-boson mass and top-quark mass agree well with the direct measurements, constituting crucial tests of the electroweak SM. In addition, the mass of the as yet unobserved Higgs boson is constrained, with the result: m H < 144 GeV at 95% confidence level. The direct observation of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass, expected for the next few years, will complete this domain of the electroweak interaction, but may also lead to new surprises.",

The LHC is a W/Z/top factory, allowing for high-statistics measurements in any final state with leptons.
