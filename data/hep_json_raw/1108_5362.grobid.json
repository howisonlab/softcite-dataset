We conclude that all observed discrepancies between data and model can be attributed to uncertainties in the standard model background modeling, and hence we do not see any evidence for physics beyond the standard model.",

Despite this success, there are strong motivations to expect new phenomena at energies at the order of the electroweak scale. For example, the Higgs boson [2] receives quantum corrections to its mass through loop diagrams. The scalar nature of the Higgs boson leads to a quadratic divergence, with an upper limit of the integral set by the highest scale, i.e., the Planck mass (10 19 GeV). To maintain the Higgs mass close to the electroweak scale, it is necessary to fine tune a parameter in the theory to within M W /M Planck \u2248 10 \u221216 [3].",

If any particular final state or distribution found discrepant with the SM remains significantly discrepant after systematic uncertainties are considered, then it warrants claim for the presence of physics beyond the SM. The benefit of this approach is that we can look in a coordinated way at many channels, applying expectations from the SM and a model of the detector in a relatively straightforward manner, to search for discrepancies between data and the SM.",

A simplified example for the e + jets + X final state (X = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 , \u03b3) is used to illustrate the procedure. The e + jets + X state is dominated by W \u2192 e\u03bd events, but there is a significant contribution from multijet and Drell-Yan events. We use the normalization factor for the Drell-Yan process, determined through a separate fit to the ee + X final state (X = \u00b5, \u03c4 , \u03b3), in the e + jets fit. We also fix the scale factors to one for rare processes which have contributions that are too small to fit accurately in e + jets, such as the tt contribution. We then fit for the SM W boson and multijet contributions in the data. The fit optimizes agreement between the distributions in data and the SM prediction for the variables listed above. The result of the fit is two overall weights, one for W \u2192 e\u03bd and one for multijet \u2192 e + jets.",

Second, it calculates a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (and resulting fit probability) for the consistency of all the kinematic distributions in any final state with the predicted SM distributions. Both of these results require additional interpretation because of the large number of trials (number of final states and/or the number of distributions) involved. When observing many final states, some disagreement is expected from statistical fluctuations in the data. Thus the Poisson probability used to determine agreement is corrected to reflect this multiple testing. A similar effect occurs when comparing kinematic distributions, and again the probabilities are first converted to standard deviations and then corrected for the number of distributions examined.",

The sleuth algorithm is quasi-model independent, where \"quasi\" refers to the assumption that the physics beyond the SM will appear as an excess of events in some final state at large p T . For sleuth, the vista exclusive X + 0 jet and X + 1 jet final states are merged, as are the X + 2 jets and X + 3 jets final states, and light-lepton universality is assumed, combining eX and \u00b5X channels. Underlying these assumptions is the belief that any new physics will leave similar signatures in events with no radiative jets or one radiative jet, and in electron and muon final states. Therefore combining these final states increases the statistics in each final state while reducing the trials factor needed to account for looking in multiple final states. In each final state, the p T distribution is scanned to find the cutoff above which the significance of any excess in data relative to the SM background is maximal, with the condition that at least three events be observed above the cutoff. This defines the most interesting region for this final state. Next, pseudo-experiments are generated with pseudo data pulled from the SM background expectation for this final state, and the fraction of pseudo-experiments is determined in which the most interesting region is at least as interesting as the most interesting region found in real data. This gives the probability that the most significant excess observed in the considered final state arise from a background fluctuation. Finally, a corrected probability is estimated from the fraction of hypothetical experiments that would produce a region in any final state at least as interesting as the most interesting region observed among all final states in real data. We define a significant output from sleuth as one with a corrected probability of < 0.001 (that is over 3 Gaussian standard deviations from the SM prediction using a one-sided confidence interval).",

IV B 6, the muon smearing modeling is based on muons from Z and J/\u03c8 decays, dominated by muons below 60 GeV, and is not as reliable at high p T . The prime signature of poorly simulated high p T muons is an excess of E T because of the mismodeling of the resolution of the mismeasured track. The \u2206\u03c6 between the positive muon and E T in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 + E T final state is shown in Fig. 10b, where the excess tends to be for events where the E T is collinear with a muon.

This broad search for BSM physics is based on 1.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider in the D0 experiment. Using the vista algorithm, a total of 117 exclusive final states and 5543 kinematic distributions were compared to the SM background predictions. Only two out of 117 exclusive final states, \u00b5 \u00b1 + 2 jets + E T and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 + E T , show a statistically significant discrepancy. Given the known modeling difficulties in both final states together with our neglect in this study of systematical uncertainties, we cannot attribute the observed discrepancies to sources of physics beyond the standard model. A quasimodel-independent search for new physics was also performed using the algorithm sleuth by looking for statistically significant excess at high p T in a wide array of exclusive final states. No additional final states cross the discovery threshold in sleuth beyond the excesses noted by vista. ",
