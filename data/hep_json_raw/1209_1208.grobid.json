The LHCb experiment at CERN is the ideal place for these searches as it has recorded the worlds largest sample of beauty mesons. The status of the rare decay analyses with 1 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV of ppcollisions collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 is reviewed. The worlds most precise measurements of the angular structure of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays is discussed, as well as the isospin asymmetry measurement in B \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays. The most stringent upper exclusion limit on the branching fraction of B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays is shown, as well as searches for lepton number and lepton flavor violating processes.",

They can proceed via loop level electroweak (Z 0 , \u03b3) penguin or box diagrams. In extensions to the SM, new virtual particles can enter at loop level, modifying the amplitude of the process or the Lorentz structure of the decay vertex. Possible deviations from the SM predictions on branching fractions or angular distributions could lead to the discovery of physics beyond the SM.",

An angular analysis of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays 2 allows a stringent test of the Lorentz structure of the electroweak penguin process and is particularly sensitivity to right-handed currents.

For the B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 system, no SM calculation of A I exists, but it is similarly expected to be close to zero.

All measurements are consistent with each other and the B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 measurement is also consistent with the SM prediction. The B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 measurements are consistent amongst the experiments but are less consistent with the naive expectation that A I = 0.

The inclusive \u03c4 \u2212 production crosssection at LHCb is very large, about 80 \u00b5b. The composition of the \u03c4 \u2212 production can be calculated from the bb and cc [24] cross-sections measured at the LHCb experiment and the inclusive branching ratios b \u2192 \u03c4 and c \u2192 \u03c4 [25]. About 80% of the produced \u03c4 \u2212 -leptons originate from D \u2212 s decays. LHCb has performed a search for the decay \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 using 1.0 fb \u22121 of data [26].

As the data sample increases this limit is expected to scale with the square root of the luminosity, with possible further reduction depending on improvements in the analysis. The large integrated luminosity that will be collected by the upgraded LHCb experiment will provide a sensitivity corresponding to an upper limit of a few times 10 \u22129 [27].",
