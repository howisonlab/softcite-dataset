            "text": "The comparison of cross-section predictions with data on single-inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions, p+p \u2192 h + X, is important for understanding perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). For hadrons produced with transverse momenta p T \u226b \u039b QCD , the cross section factorizes into a convolution involving long-distance and short-distance components [1,2]. Long-distance components include universal partondistribution functions (PDFs) describing the partonic structure of the initial hadrons and fragmentation functions (FFs) for the final-state hadron. The short-distance part describes the hard scattering of partons. The longdistance components, PDFs and FFs, can be extracted from other processes, such as deep-inelastic scattering and hadron production in e + e \u2212 colliders. This allows for a test of the short-distance part of the convolution, which can be estimated using pQCD. In particular, differences between data and predictions can indicate the importance of neglected higher-order terms in the expansion or power-suppressed contributions [3].",

However, at lower \u221a s, in particular in fixed-target experiments with 20 < \u223c \u221a s < \u223c 40 GeV, NLO pQCD calculations significantly underpredict hadron production, by factors of three or more [3]. The consistency between NLO estimations and data at low \u221a s was improved [3,12,13] by including the resummation of large logarithmic corrections to the partonic cross section to all orders in the strong coupling \u03b1 s . The corrections are of the form \u03b1 k s ln 2k 1 \u2212x 2 T for the kth-order term in the perturbative expansion. Herex T \u2261 2p T / \u221a\u015d , where T = p T /z is the transverse momentum of the parton fragmenting into the observed hadron with a fraction z of the parton transverse momentum, and \u221a\u015d = \u221a x 1 x 2 s is the partonic center-of-mass energy where x 1 , x 2 are momentum fractions carried by two interacting partons. The corrections are especially relevant in the threshold regimex T \u2192 1 in which the initial partons have just enough energy to produce a high-transverse-momentum parton fragmenting into the observed hadron. In this regime gluon Bremsstrahlung is suppressed, and these corrections are large [12]. However, the addition of the resummed next-to-leading-log (NLL) terms to an NLO calculation may not provide the best means of describing data in a given kinematic region, for example, when the (unknown) higher-order terms that are omitted from the calculation have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the NLL terms. It is therefore important to test pQCD calculations against data in a region of intermediate \u221a s, to better define the kinematic ranges over which pQCD calculations can be applied with confidence.",

The new results allow tests of NLO and NLL predictions based on an independent measurement. In addition, the theoretical calculations make use of different fragmentation functions than for identified particle calculations. Alternatively, assuming the reliability of the short-distance aspects of the theory, the data may be used to refine our knowledge of fragmentation functions. Present measurements also cover a greater p T range than the identified charged-hadron cross sections, where the measured momentum ranges for pions, kaons, and protons are 0.3-3 GeV/c, 0.4-2 GeV/c and 0.5-4.5 GeV/c respectively [14]. These cross-section measurements of nonidentified charged hadrons (combinations of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p \u00b1 ) are also important as baselines for extracting nuclear modification factors in high-p T hadron production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC [15,16].",

This makes the asymmetry reported here, A LL (p+p \u2192 h \u00b1 + X), sensitive to the polarized gluon PDF \u2206G(x) at leading order, and more sensitive to its sign than processes dominated by gluon-gluon scattering or which produce isospin-symmetric particles. For example, preferential fragmentation of up quarks into positive pions and down quarks into negative pions, combined with the fact that the up quark helicity PDF is positive and the down quark helicity PDF is negative, would lead to an ordering of the asymmetries of pions (charged and neutral) directly sensitive to the sign of the gluon helicity PDF. Positive \u2206G(x) would lead to A \u03c0 + LL \u2265 A \u03c0 0 LL \u2265 A \u03c0 \u2212 LL , whereas a negative \u2206G(x) would imply an opposite ordering.

Distributions of the matching variables (difference between the projected track position and actual hits on PC3, termed PC3d\u03c6 and PC3dz) are fit with the combination of a signal Gaussian and a second Gaussian for background. Figure 1 demonstrates the method for a sample p T bin. The width of the fit to the signal distribution is used to impose a simultaneous selection window of 2\u03c3 for both matching variables. The background to these measurements comes from several sources. One source is soft electrons from the magnet pole faces, and another is decays in flight of \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 . Not all of these electrons are rejected by the RICH cut. Off-vertex electrons and daughter particles with a perpendicular momentum kick from the decay are reconstructed as apparent high-p T tracks, but with wide Gaussian track matching distributions. The background fraction in each of the p T bins is determined by using the distributions of the matching variables. Background fractions, which are 2-5% for p T \u2264 2.75 GeV/c and \u223c 30% in the highest p T bin, are subsequently subtracted from hadron yields.",

Feed-down contributions to the detected protons and antiprotons from weak decays of \u039b's and heavier hyperons are estimated using input \u039b and \u039b spectra from p + p measurements at \u221a s = 63 GeV at the ISR [46,47] and at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV at PHENIX with a geant3 [48]-based simulation of the PHENIX detector. The fractional contributions of the feed-down protons and antiprotons are independent of p T above p T = 2 GeV/c and are close to 7 and 15% respectively. Below p T = 2 GeV/c the fractions increase with decreasing p T and are roughly 25 and 60% for protons and antiprotons respectively at p T = 0.5 GeV/c. Background-subtracted yields are corrected for angular resolution of the DC and for smearing of the reconstructed momenta resulting from multiple scattering of tracks, which depends on hadron mass. To account for the acceptance of the PHENIX detector system and the varying efficiency for different hadrons, single-particle Monte-Carlo simulations are performed and verified by comparing the live detector area between data and Monte Carlo, and appropriate correction factors are determined separately for each hadron species.  Figure 2 shows the efficiencies for the three positive hadron species. The small efficiency for kaons is due to decays in flight. The large decrease in efficiency at low p T is due to the fact that the fixed pseudorapidity accep- tance of the detector corresponds to a narrow range in rapidity for smaller p T /m. The efficiencies are parameterized (Ae BpT +C) as a function of p T . Table I shows the fit-function parameters. The fit values are used for the calculation of cross sections. The species-dependent corrections are applied according to their production fraction ( Fig. 3) in the hadron mixture. The production fractions were determined from identified hadron spectra from PHENIX [14], as well as earlier data from the ISR [46]. Dotted and dashed lines in Fig. 2 represent fits with individual data sets. Parameterized fits of the form Ae BpT + C (for positive pions and negative kaons) and Ae BpT + C + Dp T (for all other species) are performed under the constraint that the sum of the relative fractions is 1. Table II gives the fit-function parameters.",

The integrated luminosity L int = NBBC \u03c3BBC , required for normalization of the invariant cross section, is calculated using the count of BBC-triggered events and the BBC normalization parameter \u03c3 BBC .

Table III shows the systematic uncertainties of cross section measurements from various sources. The largest contribution (11-24%) to the p T -dependent systematic uncertainty comes from the correction for the acceptance and detection efficiencies. The uncertainty on the cross section due to this correction factor is determined by varying the selection parameters in the MC simulations. The trigger bias introduces a 2.5% uncertainty in the overall normalization, in addition to the 11% uncertainty on \u03c3 BBC . Determination of the background fraction and the production fraction of separate hadron species each introduces a 1-5 % p T -dependent systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties from other sources, for example the correction for momentum resolution, the correction for the active area of the detector in experiment and Monte Carlo, are \u223c1-2%. Table IV show the inclusive chargedhadron cross sections from p + p collisions at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV as a function of p T .

On the upper panels of both plots in Fig. 4 the cross sections are compared to NLO and NLL calculations at a factorization, renormalization and fragmentation scale of \u00b5 = p T [49]. The calculations were performed using Martin-Roberts-Stirling-Thorne (MRST2002) PDFs [50] and deFlorian-Sassot-Stratmann (DSS) fragmentation functions [51]. The NLO predictions have been shown to describe midra-pidity cross section results for neutral pions [52,53] and charged hadrons [45] at \u221a s = 200 GeV within \u223c 20% for a scale choice of \u00b5 = p T . For the present results at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV, however, the NLO calculations underpredict the data by as much as \u223c 80% in the case of positive hadrons and \u223c 60% in the case of negative hadrons for the same scale choice. The lower two panels in the Fig. 4 plots show the dependence of the theoretical calculations on the choice of factorization, renormalization and fragmentation scale (\u00b5) for three different values (p T , p T /2, and2p T ). The inclusion of higher-order terms in the NLL calculations leads to a considerably smaller scale dependence.",

Comparison of the present results to the calculations at NLO with and without NLL terms included indicates that in the measured kinematic range, NLL terms make relevant contributions to the cross section. However, the tendency of the NLL calculations to overpredict the data, by as much as \u223c 40% in the case of positive hadrons and \u223c 50% in the case of negative hadrons for a scale choice of p T , may indicate that there are terms in the full next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) expansion that are of comparable magnitude and opposite sign to those in the NLL calculation. These measurements corroborate similar indications from neutral pion cross section results [40] and identified hadron cross section results [14] at PHENIX. The present measurements can also be useful in a future determination of inclusive charged-hadron fragmentation functions, as progress in pQCD has allowed inclusion of p+p cross section measurements and semi-inclusive deepinelastic lepton-nucleon scattering data in FF parameterizations along with the traditionally used e + e \u2212 data since 2007 [51,54,55].",

The comparison with pQCD calculations shows that the NLO estimations are consistent with cross section results within a large scale uncertainty. NLL calculations with their reduced scale dependence are also consistent with the data, indicating that the threshold resummation of logarithmic terms is relevant in the kinematic region measured; however, the overprediction of the data by up to \u223c 50% if the NLL terms are included suggests that contributions from NNLO terms may also be important. This corroborates other recent results from PHENIX [14,40] with similar indications. The asymmetry results are the first measurements for charged hadron production in polarized p + p collisions at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV and are consistent with the asymmetries found using several other probes at different collision energies at RHIC [4,5,8,10,40,53]. Experimental measurements of a variety of processes covering a broad kinematic range are essential to advancing our understanding of QCD in hadronic interactions and nucleon structure, and the present measurements contribute towards that end.",
