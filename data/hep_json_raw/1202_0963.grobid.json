The diphoton channel has the advantage that the branching ratio for spin-2 gravitons is twice that to leptons. Two isolated photons are selected with E T > 70 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.44. The resulting diphoton invariant mass distribution with 2.2 fb \u22121 of data is shown in Fig. 1  [4]. The expected background arising from irreducible SM diphoton production is estimated using simulation, scaled by a next-to-leading order mass dependent K factor. Instrumental backgrounds, arising from \u03b3+jet and dijet processes, in which the jets are misidentified as photons, are estimated using a datadriven fake rate method. Observing no excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution above SM expectations, upper limits are set on the production cross section for RS a e-mail: toyoko.orimoto@cern.ch gravitons, using the CL S technique [5,6]. The limits on the cross section are translated into lower limits on the model parameters ( Fig. 2), where M 1 is the mass of the first graviton excitation, andk is a dimensionless parameter which quantifies the strength of the graviton coupling to SM fields. We exclude at the 95% confidence level (CL) resonant graviton production in the RS1 model with values of M 1 < 0.86 \u2212 1.84 TeV, depending onk. tron and dimuon invariant mass distributions from 1.1 fb \u22121 of data can be seen in Fig. 3 [7]. The expected background from irreducible SM Drell-Yan production is estimated using simulation, normalized to the Z 0 peak in data. Backgrounds with prompt leptons (tt, tW, dibosons) are crosschecked using a data-driven method counting e-\u00b5 pairs. Backgrounds with jets misidentified as leptons (W+jet, dijets) are estimated using a fake rate measured from a jetenriched data sample. Lastly, cosmic muon backgrounds are rejected by imposing topological criteria. The dilepton analysis is a shape-based search, making no assumptions on the absolute background rate; this is achieved by normalizing the results to the Z 0 peak. We set limits, using a Bayesian technique, on the ratio (R \u03c3 ) of the cross section for Z (or G KK ) production to the cross section for SM Z 0 production (Fig. 4). The limits on R \u03c3 can be interpreted as lower limits on Z (G KK ) mass. We exclude at 95% CL a Z with SM-like couplings (Z SSM ) with mass < 1940 GeV, the superstring-inspired Z \u03c8 < 1620 GeV, and RS G KK < 1450 (1780) GeV fork =0.05 (0.10).",

            "text": "In this analysis, each event is divided into hemispheres, such that each hemisphere contains the final products of each top. Then, the top decays are classified into categories, depending on the how boosted the top is: (1) \"high boost\" tops are those in which all three jets are merged into one top jet and (2) \"moderate boost\" tops are those in which only two out of three of the jets are merged. We conduct the search in two categories: \"type 1+1\", which have two highly boosted top jets, or \"type 1+2\", which are threejet events. Jets are reconstructed using particle flow and Cambridge-Aachen clustering algorithms. The dominant background comes from QCD multijets, which is estimated with a data-driven top-tagging mistag rate. The small continuum tt contribution is estimated with simulation. The limits are evaluated with a counting experiment, using a Bayesian procedure. Fig. 8 depicts the 95% CL upper limits on the product of the cross section of Z and the branching ratio for its decay into tt pairs [18]. With 886 pb \u22121 , we exclude the KK gluon masses between 1.0 \u2212 1.5 TeV.",
