For Pb+Pb collisions, the spectra are presented as a function of collision centrality, which is determined by the response of the forward calorimeters located on both sides of the interaction point. The nuclear modification factors R AA and R CP are presented in detail as a function of centrality, p T and \u03b7. They show a distinct p T -dependence with a pronounced minimum at about 7 GeV. Above 60 GeV, R AA is consistent with a plateau at a centralitydependent value, within the uncertainties. The value is 0.55 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b1 0.04(syst.) in the most central collisions. The R AA distribution is consistent with flat |\u03b7| dependence over the whole transverse momentum range in all centrality classes.",

Charged hadrons of high transverse momentum (p T ) are a tool that can be used to study this strongly interacting matter [5,6]. Since the start of the LHC operation with heavy ions in 2010, it has been possible to study charged-particle production in HI collisions in a new energy regime. The first results from the LHC experiments showed that jets emerging from the medium created in such collisions have lower energy than expected in the absence of medium effects [7,8]. The measurement of fully reconstructed jets by the ATLAS experiment revealed that the energy loss of the high-energy partons in the medium, commonly referred to as jet quenching, results in a lower yield of jets at fixed p T . The yield is suppressed in central",

Collisions with complete nuclear overlap are called central collisions, and as the distance between nuclear centres increases, the collisions become more and more peripheral. The hard scattering rate is higher in more central collisions because of greater nuclear overlap where more nucleons in one nucleus can hard-scatter with nucleons in the other. Such an enhancement is expected by the Glauber model to be proportional to the product of nucleon densities in the transverse plane; the ratio is corrected for this by T AA , which is estimated as the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions over their cross section [18]. Neglecting isospin effects, the nucleon-nucleon hadron-production cross section can be approximated by the corresponding pp cross section, \u03c3 NN \u2248 \u03c3 pp , and thus the nuclear modification factor can be expressed as 1) where N evt is the number of Pb+Pb events, d 2 N Pb+Pb /d\u03b7dp T is the differential yield of charged particles in Pb+Pb collisions and d 2 \u03c3 pp /d\u03b7dp T is the differential charged-particle production cross section measured in pp collisions. It is expected that in the absence of nuclear effects, the ratio R AA will be unity in the region of p T where hadron production is dominated by hard scattering processes. The modifications of the particle spectra can also be studied using the nuclear modification factor R CP , defined as the ratio of the charged-particle yield in each centrality class -2 -",

The transverse energy measurements used by the trigger system is evaluated at the electromagnetic scale. The MB events were required either to have the transverse energy, E T , in the whole calorimeter exceeding 50 GeV at the L1 trigger or to have an ID track reconstructed in the event in coincidence with the ZDC signals on both sides. For a jet trigger, events were preselected for reconstruction by the HLT if they deposited a transverse energy of E T > 10 GeV in the calorimeters at L1 or if the ZDC produced signals in coincidence on both sides of the detector. Such events were analysed by the HLT using a jet-finding algorithm on calorimeter towers after underlying-event subtraction [20]. All events containing a jet found with the anti-k t algorithm [21] with radius parameter R = 0.2 and with E T , estimated in the trigger system, of at least 20 GeV were accepted. The HLT uses algorithms very similar to those used in the offline jet reconstruction. 2013 PYTHIA 1.9 \u00d7 10 7 Table 1. Summary of the data and simulation samples used in the analysis. \"MB\" stands for minimum bias. For Pb+Pb data, the column \"Recorded\" lists how many events for a given datataking period, trigger and centrality interval were written to disk. \"Sampled\" is the total number of events, of which only a fraction were recorded. The \"NN collisions\" column in Pb+Pb lists the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions equivalent to the \"Sampled\" events based on the Glauber model [18]. For pp data, the meaning of the column \"Recorded\" is analogous. \"Luminosity\" is the total luminosity for a given run, while \"Collisions\" gives the equivalent number of protonproton collisions for that luminosity. For the simulation samples, the tables specify the origin of the underlying event (for the Pb+Pb samples) and the hard scattering event. The last columns sum up the total number of generated events. These events may be further broken down, such as by kinematic selection on the underlying hard scattering (see text).",

The histograms show the E T of the jet to which the track is matched vs. the track p T . The reconstructed p T of the track is typically lower than the measured jet energy, reflecting the fragmentation process. Matches of tracks to jets with E T less than the track p T result from the finite resolution of the jet energy measurement or track momentum reconstruction, or from badly reconstructed or fake tracks. The solid line shown in the plot corresponds to E T = 0.8 \u00d7 p T \u2212 10 GeV which was chosen as the cut of the track-to-jet energy balance.",

Since jets are selected from each trigger only in an exclusive E T range, the contribution of tracks to the total spectrum rises and falls with E T . The effect of such a jet trigger interval selection is demonstrated by comparison of closed squares (with selection) and open squares (without selection) corresponding to the jet trigger with E T threshold of 40 GeV. Without applying a jet trigger interval selection the ratio starts at low p T at a value significantly below unity. The ratio then rises to unity where it remains flat, consistent with the combined sample of all tracks. However, the statistical uncertainty of the ratio is significantly larger than that for the samples obtained with the higher jet trigger thresholds due to the difference in the integrated luminosity associated with each trigger.",

In figure 11, charged-particle Pb+Pb spectra in the 0-5% centrality interval are shown for eight regions of |\u03b7|. Both figures show the spectra divided by the T AA of the corresponding centrality interval compared with the charged-particle production cross sections measured in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV. The charged-hadron yields in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions, depicted by diamond markers in figure 10, show a p T dependence similar to that of pp collisions. Going from peripheral to central collisions, the T AA -scaled Pb+Pb yields increasingly deviate from the pp spectra. This deviation is largest for p T less than 1 GeV and in the p T range 3-30 GeV. Figure 12 shows the nuclear modification factor R CP for four centrality classes (0-5%, 10-20%, 30-40%, 50-60%) with respect to the 60-80% class.

Statistical uncertainties are smaller than the marker size. Systematic uncertainties are shown by open boxes. The different centrality intervals are scaled down by powers of ten for plot clarity. Each centrality interval is divided by the corresponding T AA and plotted together with the pp cross section scaled by the same factor shown with solid lines. The total systematic uncertainty on the Pb+Pb spectra includes the uncertainty of T AA . statistical uncertainty of the value at the minimum is negligible. The measurement of R CP is restricted to p T < 95 GeV because it is limited by the small sample size in the 60-80% centrality class.  The R AA measured as a function of p T shows a characteristic non-flat p T shape which becomes more pronounced for more central collisions. They first increase with increasing p T reaching a maximum at p T \u2248 2 GeV, a feature commonly associated with the Cronin effect [43]. Then, R AA decreases with higher p T reaching a minimum at p T \u2248 7 GeV, where the charged-particle suppression is strongest. The rate of charged particles is noticeably suppressed even in the 60-80% centrality interval, reaching a minimum of 0.66\u00b10.09(syst.), where the effects of jet quenching are expected to be smallest. The suppression is strongest in the most central 0-5% collisions, where the minimum is 0.14 \u00b1 0.01(syst.). The statisti-    cal uncertainties in this p T region are negligible compared to the systematic uncertainties. Above this p T , R AA generally increases with increasing p T up to \u2248 60 GeV and then reaches a plateau, consistent with zero slope, at a value of 0.55 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) \u00b1 0.04(syst.) for the most central collisions.",

The ALICE experiment used a similar pseudorapidity interval, |\u03b7| < 0.8. The comparison reveals agreement of the measurements within their uncertainties.

The statistical uncertainties, which are typically smaller than the size of markers, are shown with vertical bars and the systematic uncertainties with brackets or grey bands.  Figure 16 shows R AA as a function of the mean number of participating nucleons, N part , in the four momentum intervals corresponding to the local maximum of R AA in the region 1.7 < p T < 2.0 GeV, the local minimum in the region 6.7 < p T < 7.7 GeV, the plateau region 59.8 < p T < 94.8 GeV and to the p T interval where R AA has an intermediate magnitude, between the minimum and plateau value, in the region 19.9 < p T < 22.8 GeV. In all momentum intervals R AA decreases with N part , however the decrease is strongest for the minimum interval and weakest in the plateau region. In the maximum and intermediate momentum ranges the R AA values are consistent for N part < 100, but then deviate at larger N part . In the most central collisions, R AA in the maximum interval is comparable to that in the plateau p T region. Comparing the plateau region to the R AA dependence on JHEP09(2015)050 N part measured with the jets of comparable energy [9], both distributions show similar trend. They have also similar values for peripheral collisions, but in the more central collisions the jet R AA reaches lower values.",

The widths of the d 0 distributions increase with decreasing p T due to the increase of multiple scattering. All tracks satisfy the selection criteria listed in section 5.1.Figure 2(a) shows the d 0 versus p T scatter plot for all tracks in the MB events in the 60-80% centrality interval. The width of the d 0 distribution decreases with increasing transverse momentum of the tracks. At very high p T it approaches the limit of about 10 \u00b5m defined by the Pixel detector resolution. At p T < 2 GeV and large |d 0 | a significant fraction of tracks originate from weak decays (mainly K 0 S and \u039b 0 ) inside the pixel detector. At higher p T , the region with |d 0 | exceeding 100 \u00b5m is unpopulated. The distribution of track parameters shown in figure 2(a) is similar to that in pp collisions, since both systems have relatively low occupancy and thus similar ID tracking performance.The d 0 distributions in the 0-5% most central collisions, shown in figure 2(b), are different from those in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, the d 0 distribution extends to large values even for high-p T tracks. To understand the origin of these tracks it is necessary to compare figure 2(b) to a distribution obtained from a sample of events measured under the same occupancy conditions obtained for the jet-triggered sample, shown in figure 2(c).",
