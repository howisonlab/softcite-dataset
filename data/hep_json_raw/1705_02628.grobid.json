The cross section is corrected for detector effects and compared to calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics at nextto-leading order accuracy, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections.

            "text": "The pairwise production of hadronic jets is one of the fundamental processes studied at hadron colliders. Dijet events with large transverse momenta can be described by parton-parton scattering in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Measurements of dijet cross sections can be used to thoroughly test predictions of perturbative QCD (pQCD) at high energies and to constrain parton distribution functions (PDFs). Previous measurements of dijet cross sections in proton-(anti)proton collisions have been performed as a function of dijet mass at the SppS, ISR, and Tevatron colliders [1][2][3][4][5][6]. At the CERN LHC, dijet measurements as a function of dijet mass are reported in Refs. [7][8][9][10][11]. Also, dijet events have been studied triple-differentially in transverse energy and pseudorapidities \u03b7 1 and \u03b7 2 of the two leading jets [12,13]. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules. The ECAL consists of 75 848 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage in pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.48 in a barrel region and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.0 in two endcap regions. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity and 0.087 in azimuth (\u03c6). In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5 \u00d7 5 arrays of ECAL crystals to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. For |\u03b7| > 1.74, the coverage of the towers increases progressively to a maximum of 0.174 in \u0394\u03b7 and \u0394\u03c6. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. The forward hadron (HF) calorimeter extends the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors and uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m from the interaction region, one on each end, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.",

The iterative D'Agostini algorithm with early stopping [24][25][26], as implemented in the RooUnfold package [27], is employed for the unfolding. The response matrix, which relates the particle-level distribution to the measured distribution at detector level, is derived using a forward smearing technique. An NLOJet++ prediction, obtained with CT14 PDFs [28] and corrected for NP and EW effects, is approximated by a continuous function to represent the distribution at particle level. Subsequently, pseudoevents are distributed uniformly in p T,avg and weighted according to the theoreti-cal prediction. These weighted events are smeared using the jet p T resolution to yield a response matrix and a prediction at detector level. By using large numbers of such pseudoevents, statistical fluctuations in the response matrix are strongly suppressed.",

For the evaluation of the model uncertainties some variations on the input parameters are considered. The strangeness fraction is chosen in agreement with Ref. [67] to be f s = 0.31 and is varied between 0.23 and 0.39. Following Ref. [55], the b quark mass, set to 4.5 GeV, is varied between 4.25 and 4.75 GeV. Similarly, the c quark mass, set by default to 1.47 GeV, is varied between 1.41 and 1.53 GeV.

The parameterisation uncertainty is estimated by including additional parameters in the fit, leading to a more flexible functional form of the PDFs. Each parameter is successively added in the PDF fit, and the envelope of all changes to the central PDF fit result is taken as parameterisation uncertainty. The increased flexibility of the PDFs while estimating the parameterisation uncertainty may lead to the seemingly paradoxical effect that, although new data are included, the total uncertainty can increase in regions, where direct con-straints from data are absent. This may happen at very low or at very high x, where the PDF is determined through extrapolation alone. Furthermore, the variation of the starting scale Q 2 0 to 1.6 and 2.2 GeV 2 is considered in this parameterisation uncertainty.",

Somewhat larger uncertainties in the valence quark distributions are observed in the fit using the dijet data with respect to those obtained from the inclusive jet cross section.

The model (mod) and parameterisation (par) uncertainties are evaluated in the same way as in the PDF determination. The consideration of scale uncertainties in a global PDF fit is an open issue in the PDF community because it is unclear how to deal with the correlations in scale settings among the different measurements and observables. Therefore they are not taken into account in any global PDF fit up to now, although an elaborate study of the effect of scale settings on dijet cross sections has been performed in Ref. [68], which also reports first combined PDF and \u03b1 S (M Z ) fits using LHC inclusive jet data. Following Ref. [53], where the final uncertainties and correlations Both results, \u03b1 S (M Z ) = 0.1199 +0.0015 \u22120.0016 (all except scale) with +0.0026 \u22120.0016 (scale, refit) and +0.0031 \u22120.0019 (scale, \u03b1 S (M Z ) series), are in agreement with Ref.

Similarly, it is observed that the second procedure leads to somewhat larger scale uncertainties, because there is less freedom for compensating effects between different gluon distributions and the \u03b1 S (M Z ) values. Since this latter uncertainty is the most consistent to be compared with previous fixed-PDF determinations of \u03b1 S (M Z ), it is quoted as the main result. The dominant source of uncertainty is of theoretical origin and arises due to missing higher order corrections, whose effect is estimated by scale variations.",

The impact of the data on the PDFs is demonstrated by performing a simultaneous fit to cross sections of deep-inelastic scattering obtained by the HERA experiments and the dijet cross section measured in this analysis. When including the dijet data, an increased gluon PDF at high x is obtained and the overall uncertainties of the PDFs, especially those of the gluon distribution, are significantly reduced. In contrast to a fit that uses inclusive jet data, this measurement carries more information on the valence-quark content of the proton such that a more flexible parameterisation is needed to describe the low-x behaviour of the u and d valence quark PDFs. This higher sensitivity is accompanied by slightly larger uncertainties in the valence quark distributions as a consequence of the greater flexibility in the parameterisation of the PDFs.",
