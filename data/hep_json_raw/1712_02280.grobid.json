The search is based on the analysis of data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . No significant excess of events is observed above the expected single-parton scattering yields. A 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.32 pb is set on the inclusive cross section for same-sign WW production via the double-parton scattering process. This upper limit is used to place a 95% confidence level lower limit of 12.2 mb on the effective double-parton cross section parameter, closely related to the transverse distribution of partons in the proton. This limit on the effective cross section is consistent with previous measurements as well as with Monte Carlo event generator predictions.",

These short-distance inelastic processes, called multiple-parton interactions (MPI), usually produce particles with relatively small transverse momenta (p T ) that predominantly constitute the so-called \"underlying event\". With increased parton densities at high center-of-mass energies, there is a nonnegligible probability for the production of high-p T or high-mass particles even from the secondhardest parton-parton scattering, a process known as double-parton scattering (DPS). The production cross section for a DPS process, \u03c3 DPS AB , involving two independent processes \"A\" and \"B\" with respective individual production cross sections \u03c3 A and \u03c3 B , can be factorized as:",

            "text": "The measurement of the DPS cross section is important as it provides valuable information on the distribution of partons inside the proton in the transverse direction and on the correlations between them [2][3][4][5][6][7]. DPS also constitutes a background to searches for new physics, in rare final states with multiple heavy particles, as well as to measurements of standard model processes, such as the associated production of a Higgs and a W or Z boson [8,9]. Studies of DPS have been proposed using a variety of processes, including double Drell-Yan (DY) production [10], the production of same-sign W bosons [3], W or Z boson production in association with jets [11,12], and four-jet production [13,14]. A number of experiments have previously measured DPS cross sections, using various final states at different collision energies [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. The magnitude of the cross section for a given DPS process depends on the value of \u03c3 eff and on the cross sections for the individual single-parton scattering (SPS) processes involved, according to eq. (1.1). In the simplest approaches, \u03c3 eff is expected to be independent of collision energy and of the processes involved [2,4,5,23,24]. Values of \u03c3 eff \u2248 20 mb are predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, tuned to reproduce low-p T MPI measurements [25], that assume the independence of \u03c3 eff with respect to the scale of MPI, as defined by the momentum transfer in a given parton-parton interaction. However, the existing measurements of \u03c3 eff have large systematic uncertainties [21] and hence it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion about the dependence of \u03c3 eff on either the process or the collision energy. It is therefore important to perform further DPS cross section measurements using a variety of processes at different center-of-mass energies.",

            "text": "This paper presents the first measurement of the DPS process for same-sign WW events in the dilepton final state using pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. In the case of WW production via DPS, the scale of the second hard interaction is comparable to the mass of the W boson, which is the largest scale explored experimentally so far in DPS cross section measurements. Only same-sign WW events are considered in order to suppress the contribution from the DY and SPS processes. Leptonic decays of the two W bosons into either a pair of muons or an electron-muon pair are considered, as only these W decay channels result in a properlyreconstructed final state that is not completely overwhelmed by background. Figure 1 illustrates the production of a same-sign W boson pair via the DPS process (left) and via a selection of leading order SPS processes (right). A set of DPS-sensitive observables is used in a multivariate analysis based on boosted decision trees (BDT) to enhance the signal sensitivity. The shape of the BDT discriminant is then used to set a limit on the cross section for same-sign WW production via DPS, and subsequently on \u03c3 eff . This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, a brief description of the CMS detector is presented, followed by a description of the data and the simulated samples in section 3. The event selection criteria, a description of the BDT, and the systematic uncertainties affecting the measurement are described in section 4. The results are presented in section 5, and section 6 summarizes the studies presented here. Figure 1.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected and measured using the gasionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger and data acquisition systems is designed to select potentially interesting events with high efficiency [26]. The L1 trigger uses information collected by the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in less than 4 \u00b5s. The detector data are pipelined to ensure negligible deadtime up to a L1 rate of 100 kHz. After L1 triggering, data are transferred from the readout electronics of all subdetectors to the high-level trigger processor farm, where a further reduction of event rate to few hundred Hz is achieved for the purpose of data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [27].",

The contribution from this background for the dimuon channel is found to be negligible. A b jet veto is applied in the electron-muon final state to reduce the contribution from this source.

Region 1 is used for the dimuon final state while Region 2, which additionally requires the presence of at least one b-tagged jet, is used in the electron-muon final state, since it includes a major contribution from semileptonically decaying tt events. Both regions require the presence of only one loosely identified (\"loose\") lepton in order to suppress Z \u2192 + \u2212 contributions. Also, to further reduce the contributions from W/Z boson decays in the regions enriched with misidentified leptons, the transverse mass of the lepton and p miss T , m T ( , p miss T ), is required to be less than 20 GeV and p miss T to be less than 20 GeV. The backgrounds with one prompt and one misidentified lepton are estimated using the tight-fail control sample that is constructed by requiring that one of the leptons passes the loose selection criteria only, whilst the other passes the full lepton selection criteria. Similarly, another control sample with fail-fail lepton pairs is defined in which both of the leptons pass only the loose selection criteria. Finally, the selection criteria, given in table 1, are applied to these samples and the resulting numbers of events are scaled using the lepton misidentification rate to estimate the contributions from prompt-misid. and misid.-misid. backgrounds in the signal region.",

[38]. A factor of 1.5\u00b10.3 with respect to the predicted leading-order cross section is determined. Charged dilepton finalstates from DY and tt decays contribute to the background when the charge of one of the leptons is misidentified. These processes also contribute to the background if a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton is misidentified as an electron or a muon and combines with a prompt lepton to form a same-sign electron-muon pair. The charge misidentification probability for electrons in the data is found to be compatible with that from the simulation; these backgrounds can therefore be estimated using the simulated samples. However, due to the limited statistical precision of the MC simulated samples, the shapes of the kinematic observables are obtained with opposite-sign electron-muon pairs in order to increase the sample sizes; all the other selection criteria given in table 1 are applied unchanged. The resulting distributions are then normalized to the corresponding same-sign yields. The JHEP02(2018)032 normalizations of these two backgrounds are cross-checked by constructing control regions enriched with these backgrounds. To construct a DY-enriched control region, opposite-sign pairs of electrons and muons are required to have a dilepton invariant mass that satisfies 40 < m < 80 GeV, and a dilepton transverse mass that satisfies m T < 60 GeV. For the dileptonic tt decays, a control region enriched with top quark events is constructed by inverting the b jet veto criteria in the opposite-sign WW selection requirements.",

The ratio of the efficiencies obtained from the data and simulation is used to scale the selection efficiency in the simulated samples. The uncertainty on this scale factor for the trigger efficiency is of the order of 1% and is also applied to all the simulated samples. The systematic uncertainty associated with the lepton identification efficiency (1% for muons and 4% for electrons) is applied to all simulated samples. The lepton momentum scale has uncertainties due to detector misalignment [38]. For the muons, a momentum scale uncertainty of 1%, independent of its \u03b7, is JHEP02(2018)032  assigned. A momentum scale uncertainty of 2% is assigned for electrons in the barrel, and 4% for electrons in the endcaps of the ECAL. The lepton momentum scale affects the final predicted yields by 1-2% in each channel. The effects of the jet energy scale uncertainty and the jet energy resolution are evaluated by shifting the p T of the leptons and the jets by their respective uncertainties, with the effect being propagated to p miss T [47,48,52]. These uncertainties cause the predicted event yields to vary by 2-4% for the dimuon and by 5% for the electron-muon channels, respectively.",

The analyzed data were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2012 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The results presented here are based on the analysis of events containing two same-sign W bosons decaying into either same-sign muon-muon or electron-muon pairs. Several kinematic observables have been studied to identify those that can better discriminate between DPS and the single-parton scattering (SPS) backgrounds. These observables with discriminating power are used as an input to a multivariate analysis based on boosted decision trees. No excess over the expected contributions from SPS processes is observed. A 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit of 0.32 pb is placed on the inclusive cross section for same-sign WW production via DPS. A corresponding 95% CL lower limit of 12.2 mb on the effective double-parton cross section is also derived, compatible with previous measurements as well as with Monte Carlo event generator expectations.",
