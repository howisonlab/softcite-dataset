The 4 events are produced in the decays of resonant Z and Higgs bosons and the nonresonant Z Z continuum originating from qq, gg, and qg initial states. A total of 476 signal candidate events are observed with a background expectation of 26.2 \u00b1 3.6 events, enabling the measurement of the integrated cross section and the differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the four-lepton system. In the mass range above 180 GeV, assuming the theoretical constraint on the qq production cross section calculated with perturbative NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak corrections, the signal strength of the gluon-fusion component relative to its leading-order prediction is determined to be \u03bc gg = 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 (stat.) \u00b1 0.5 (syst.) \u00b1 0.8 (theory).",

For the four-lepton (4 , = e, \u03bc) production, both the integrated cross section and the differential cross sections as functions of invariant mass (m 4 ) and transverse momentum (p 4 T ) of the 4 system are measured in a mass range 80 < m 4 < 1000 GeV. In addition, the 4 signal strength of gluon fusion (ggF) production relative to its leading-order (LO) QCD estimate is measured. These measurements test the validity of the Standard Model (SM) through the interplay of QCD and electroweak effects for different 4 production mechanisms as described by the LO Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 1. The 4 signal events come from the decays of resonant Z and Higgs bosons and the non-resonant ZZ continuum produced from qq, gg, and qg initial states, which are briefly discussed below.",

The cross section significantly increases when both Z bosons are produced on-shell, resulting in a rise in the m 4 spectrum around 180 GeV.

It consists of silicon pixel and strip detectors surrounded by a straw tube tracker that also provides transition radiation measurements for electron identification. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. For |\u03b7| < 2.5, the liquid-argon electromagnetic calorimeter is finely segmented and plays an important role in the electron identification. The MS includes fast trigger chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.4) and high-precision tracking chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.7. A three-level trigger system selects events to be recorded for offline physics analysis.",

The production through the qg initial state is an NLO contribution to the qq process. The CT10NLO [15] set of parton distribution functions (PDFs), with QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales (\u03bc R , \u03bc F ) set to m 4 are used to calculate the cross section and generate the kinematic distributions. The NNLO QCD [16] and the NLO electroweak (EW) [17] corrections are applied to the NLO cross section calculated by POWHEG-BOX as a function of the 4 mass for the kinematic region where both Z bosons are produced on-shell. Following the same approach as described in Ref. [8], the 4 event distributions are re-weighted to match those expected when using QCD scales of m 4 /2. This is done to unify the QCD scales used in simulation of the qq and the gg processes. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

In the unfolding of binned data, the effects of the experimental acceptance and resolution are expressed in terms of a response matrix, where each element corresponds to the probability of an event in the i-th generator level bin being reconstructed in the j-th measurement bin. The response matrix is combined with the measured spectrum to form a likelihood, which is then multiplied by a prior distribution to produce the posterior probability of the true spectrum. The SM prediction is used as the initial prior, and once the posterior probability is obtained, it is used as the prior for the next iteration. The spectrum becomes insensitive to the initial prior after a few iterations. The differences between successive iterations are used to estimate the stability of the unfolding method. In this analysis four iterations are performed.",

The fit result is \u03bc gg = 2.4 \u00b1 1.0(stat.) \u00b1 0.5(syst.) \u00b1 0.8(theory). This result corresponds to a gg-initiated cross section of 3.1 fb, which has the same relative uncertainties as \u03bc gg itself in the inclusive fiducial volume as defined in Table 2 with the additional requirement of m 4 > 180 GeV. The largest uncertainty is statistical. The theoretical uncertainty is mainly due to the normalisation uncertainty of the qq \u2192 Z Z process.",

These theoretical studies confirm that the gluon soft-collinear approximation predicts similar K -factors for off-shell Higgs-boson and interference, hence supporting the assumption of a similar K -factor for the continuum Z Z production. These theoretical calculated K -factors are compatible with the result obtained by this analysis, where the gg-initiated 4 events are produced predominantly from the continuum Z Z production.",

The background for + ee final states arises from associated production of a Z boson with other objects namely jets misidentified as electrons, which can be light-flavour hadrons misidentified as electrons, photon conversions reconstructed as electrons, or electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. For both the + \u03bc\u03bc and + ee cases, the numbers of background events are estimated from a fit performed simultaneously to three mutually exclusive control regions, each of them providing information on one or more background components. The fit is based on the mass of the leading dilepton, m 12 , which peaks at the Z mass for the Z + jets component and has a broad distribution for the tt component. The three control regions are fit simultaneously to extract the different components of the reducible background, using a profile likelihood approach where the input template shapes for Z + jets and tt are obtained from simulation. The fitted yields in the control regions are extrapolated to the signal region using efficiencies, referred to as transfer factors, obtained from simulation. Independent validation regions are used to check the extrapolations.
