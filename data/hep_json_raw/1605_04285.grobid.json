The dataset used was recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . Six signal selections are defined that best exploit the signal characteristics. The data agree with the Standard Model background expectation in all six signal selections, and the largest deviation is a 2.1 standard deviation excess. The results are interpreted in a simplified model where pair-produced gluinos decay via the lightest chargino to the lightest neutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to masses of approximately 1.6 TeV depending on the mass spectrum of the simplified model, thus surpassing the limits of previous searches.",

The partner particles of the SM fermions (quarks and leptons) are the scalar squarks (q) and sleptons (\u02dc ). In the boson sector, the supersymmetric partner of the gluon is the fermionic gluino (g), whereas the supersymmetric partners of the Higgs (higgsinos) and the electroweak gauge bosons (winos and bino) mix to form charged and neutral mass eigenstates called charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 1,2 ) and neutralinos (\u03c7 0 1,2,3,4 ). In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) [7,8] two scalar Higgs doublets along with their Higgsino partners are predicted. SUSY addresses the SM hierarchy problem [9][10][11][12] provided that the masses of at least some of the supersyme-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch metric particles (most notably the higgsinos, the top squarks and the gluinos) are near the TeV scale.",

Other supersymmetric particles not entering the decay chain described are not considered in this simplified model and their masses are set to high values. The gluino decay is assumed to proceed only via virtual first-and second-generation quarks, hence no bottom or top quarks are produced in the simplified model. The free parameters of the model are the masses of the gluino (mg), the chargino (m\u03c7\u00b1 1 ), and the neutralino (m\u03c70 1 ).

The soft-lepton 2-jet region provides sensitivity to scenarios characterised by a relatively heavy neutralino and a small mass separation between the gluino, the chargino and the neutralino. Due to the small mass separation, most of the decay products tend to be low p T , or soft. Thus, a highp T initial-state radiation (ISR) jet recoiling against the rest of the event is required, in order to enhance the kinematic properties of the signal and to provide separation with respect to the backgrounds. The soft-lepton 5-jet region is designed to be sensitive to the configurations in parameter space with a large mass gap between the gluino and chargino and a small separation between m\u03c7\u00b1 1 and m\u03c70",

A data-driven matrix method, following the implementation described in Ref. [16], confirms this background is consistent with zero. This is mainly a result of the improved lepton reconstruction and identification and the higher threshold on E miss T with respect to the previous searches performed in this final state [16]. As this background is found to be negligible it is ignored in all aspects of the analysis. Figure 2 visualises the criteria that define the control regions in the soft-lepton and hard-lepton channels. Based on these, separate control regions are defined to extract the normalisation factors for tt and W +jets by requiring at least one, or no, b-tagged signal jets, respectively. The crosscontamination between these two types of control regions is accounted for in the fit. Figure 3 shows the E miss T distribution in selected softlepton and hard-lepton control regions. The normalisation of the W +jets and tt simulations are adjusted to match the observed number of data events in the control region, so that the plots illustrate the modelling of the shape of each variable's distribution. In general, good agreement between data and background simulations is found within the uncertainties in all the control regions used in the analysis.",

The dark grey dashed line indicates the expected limit with the yellow band representing the \u00b11\u03c3 variation of the median expected limit due to the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
