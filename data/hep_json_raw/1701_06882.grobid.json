            "text": "The production of prompt photons in proton-proton (pp) collisions, pp \u2192 \u03b3 + X, provides a testing ground for perturbative QCD (pQCD) with a hard colourless probe. All photons produced in pp collisions that are not secondaries from hadron decays are considered as \"prompt\". Two processes contribute to promptphoton production in pp \u2192 \u03b3 + X: the direct process, in which the photon originates directly from the hard interaction, and the fragmentation process, in which the photon is emitted in the fragmentation of a high transverse momentum (p T ) parton [1,2]. Measurements of inclusive prompt-photon production were used recently to investigate novel approaches to the description of parton radiation [3] and the importance of resummation of threshold logarithms in QCD and of the electroweak corrections [4]. Comparisons of prompt-photon data and pQCD are usually limited by the theoretical uncertainties associated with the missing higherorder terms in the perturbative expansion. The extension of the recent next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) pQCD calculations for jet production [5] to prompt-photon production 1 will allow a more stringent test of pQCD. To make such a test with small experimental and theoretical uncertainties, it is optimal to perform measurements of prompt-photon production at high photon transverse energies and at the highest possible centre-of-mass energy of the colliding particles.",

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The inner-detector system is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector is closest to the interaction region and provides four measurements per track; the innermost layer, known as the insertable B-layer [24], was added in 2014 and provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking performance. The pixel detector is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four three-dimensional measurement points per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by the transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The calorimeter system covers the range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters; for |\u03b7| < 2.5 the LAr calorimeters are divided into three layers in depth. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid angle coverage is completed out to |\u03b7| = 4.9 with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. Events are selected using a first-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the maximum event rate of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [25].",

Only events taken in stable beam conditions and satisfying detector and data-quality requirements are considered. The total integrated luminosity of the collected sample amounts to 3.16 \u00b1 0.07 fb \u22121 [26,27]. Events were recorded using a single-photon trigger, with a transverse energy threshold of 120 GeV. The trigger efficiency for isolated photons with 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . The transverse energy is defined as E T = E sin \u03b8 , where E is the energy.",

An initial selection is derived using the information from the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral shower shape in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, where most of the photon energy is contained. The final tight selection applies stringent criteria [28] to these variables, different for converted and unconverted photon candidates. It also places requirements on the shower shape in the finely segmented first calorimeter layer to ensure the compatibility of the measured shower profile with that originating from a single photon impacting the calorimeter. When applying the photon identification criteria to simulated events, corrections are made for small differences in the average values of the shower-shape variables between data and simulation. The efficiency of the photon identification varies in the range 92-98% for E \u03b3 T = 125 GeV and 86-98% for E \u03b3 T = 1 TeV, depending on \u03b7 \u03b3 and whether the photon candidate is classified as unconverted or converted [28,29]. For E \u03b3 T > 125 GeV, the uncertainty in the photon identification efficiency varies between 1% and 5%, depending on \u03b7 \u03b3 and E \u03b3 T . The photon energy measurement is made using calorimeter and tracking information. A dedicated energy calibration [30] is then applied to the candidates to account for upstream energy loss and both lateral and longitudinal leakage; a multivariate regression algorithm to calibrate electron and photon energy measurements was developed and optimised on simulated events. The calibration of the layer energies in the calorimeter is based on the measurement performed with 2012 data at \u221a s = 8 TeV [30]. The overall energy scale in data and the difference in the energy resolution's constant term 4 between data and simulation are estimated with a sample of Z -boson decays to electrons recorded in 2012 and reprocessed using the same electron reconstruction and calibration scheme as used for the 2015 data taking and event processing. The energy scale and resolution corrections are checked using Z -boson decays to electrons recorded in the 2015 data set. Uncertainties in the measurements performed with this sample are estimated following a procedure similar to that discussed in Ref. [30]. The difference between the values measured with the 2015 data and those predicted from the reprocessed 2012 data is also taken into account in the uncertainties. The uncertainty in the photon energy scale at high E \u03b3 T is typically 0.5-2.0%, depending on \u03b7 \u03b3 . Events with at least one photon candidate with calibrated 3 Conversion vertex candidates are reconstructed from pairs of oppositely charged tracks in the inner detector that are likely to be electrons [28]. 4 The relative energy resolution is parameterised as",

The isolation transverse energy is computed from topological clusters of calorimeter cells [31] and is denoted by E iso T . The measured value of E iso T is corrected for leakage of the photon's energy into the isolation cone and the estimated contributions from the underlying event (UE) and additional inelastic pp interactions (pile-up). The latter two corrections are computed simultaneously on an eventby-event basis [18] and the combined correction is typically 2 GeV. The combined correction is computed using a method suggested in Refs. [32,33]: the k t jet algorithm [34,35] with jet radius R = 0.5 is used to reconstruct all jets taking as input topological clusters of calorimeter cells; no explicit transverse momentum threshold is applied. The ambient-transverse energy density for the event (\u03c1), from pile-up and the underlying event, is computed using the median of the distribution of the ratio between the jet transverse energy and its area. Finally, \u03c1 is multiplied by the area of the isolation cone to compute the correction to E iso T . In addition, for simulated events, data-driven corrections to E iso T are applied such that the peak position in the E iso T distribution coincides in data and simulation.

Fragmentation into hadrons was performed using the Lund string model [38] in the case of Pythia, and in Sherpa events by a modified version of the cluster model [39]. The LO NNPDF2.3 [40] PDFs were used for Pythia (NLO CT10 [41] for Sherpa) to parameterise the proton structure. Both samples include a simulation of the UE. The event-generator parameters were set according to the \"A14\" tune for Pythia [42] and the \"CT10\" tune for Sherpa. All the samples of generated events were passed through the Geant4-based [43] ATLAS detector-and triggersimulation programs [44]. They were reconstructed and analysed by the same program chain as the data. Pile-up from additional pp collisions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings was simulated by overlaying each MC event with a variable number of simulated inelastic pp collisions generated using Pythia8 with the A2 tune [45]. The MC events were weighted to reproduce the distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing (\u03bc) observed in the data, referred to as \"pile-up reweighting\"; in this procedure, the \u03bc value in the data is divided by a factor of 1.16 \u00b1 0.07, a rescaling which improves the agreement between the data and simulation for the observed number of primary vertices and recovers the fraction of visible cross-section of inelastic pp collisions as measured in the data [46].",

The Sherpa samples were generated with LO matrix elements for photon-plus-jet final states with up to three additional partons (2 \u2192 n processes with n from 2 to 5); the matrix elements were merged with the Sherpa parton shower [47] using the ME+PS@LO prescription. While the bremsstrahlung component was modelled in Pythia by final-state QED radiation arising from calculations of all 2 \u2192 2 QCD processes, it was accounted for in Sherpa through the matrix elements of 2 \u2192 n processes with n \u2265 3; in the generation of the Sherpa samples, a requirement on the photon isolation at the matrix-element level was imposed using the criterion defined in Ref.

A detailed assessment of the uncertainties in the photon energy scale and resolution is made using the same method developed with 8 TeV data [30]. The sources of uncertainty include: the uncertainty in the overall energy scale adjustment using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 ; the uncertainty in the non-linearity of the energy measurement at the cell level; the uncertainty in the relative calibration of the different calorimeter layers; the uncertainty in the amount of material in front of the calorimeter; the uncertainty in the modelling of the reconstruction of photon conversions; the uncertainty in the modelling of the lateral shower shape; the uncertainty in the modelling of the sampling term; the uncertainty in the measurement of the constant term in Z -boson decays. Additional systematic uncertainties are included to take into account the differences between the 2012 and 2015 configurations. These uncertainties are modelled using independent components to account for their \u03b7 dependence. All the components are propagated through the analysis separately to maintain the full information about the correlations. The systematic uncertainties in the measured cross sections due to the effects mentioned above are estimated by varying by \u00b11\u03c3 each individual source of uncertainty separately in the MC simulations and then added in quadrature. The resulting uncertainty increases from about 2% at E \u03b3 T = 125 GeV to about 5% at E \u03b3 T \u223c 1 TeV except in the 1.56 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.81 7 The photon identification efficiencies from data-driven methods and MC simulations were compared in Ref. [28]. No significant difference is observed between the data-driven measurements and the nominal or corrected (for the small differences in the average values of the shower-shape variables between data and simulation) simulation for E T and the choice of inverted photon identification variables used in the selection of non-tight photons. To study the dependence on the specific choices, these definitions are varied over a wide range. The lower limit on E iso T in regions B and D is varied by \u00b11 GeV, which is larger than any difference between data and simulations and still provides a sufficient sample to perform the data-driven subtraction. The upper limit on E iso T in regions B and D is removed. The resulting uncertainty in the measured cross sections is negligible. Likewise, the choice of inverted photon identification variables is varied. The analysis is repeated using different sets of variables: tighter (looser) identification criteria are defined by applying tight requirements to an extended (restricted) set of shower-shape variables in the first calorimeter layer. The resulting uncertainty in the measured cross sections is typically smaller than 2%.",

The predictions based on MMHT2014, CT14 and NNPDF3.0 are very similar, the differences being much smaller than the theoretical scale uncertainties. For most of the points, the theoretical uncertainties are larger than those of experimental origin. Differences are observed between data and the predictions of up to 10-15% depending on E \u03b3 T and |\u03b7 \u03b3 |; since the theoretical uncertainties are 10-15% and cover those differences, it is concluded that the NLO pQCD predictions provide an adequate description of the measurements.",
