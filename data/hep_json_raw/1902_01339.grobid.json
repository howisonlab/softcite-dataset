            "text": "Exclusive vector meson (VM) photoproduction, \u03b3 p \u2192 VMp, has received renewed interest following recent studies of ultraperipheral collisions involving ions and protons at the CERN LHC [1,2]. In such collisions, photon-induced interactions predominantly occur when the colliding hadrons are separated by a distance larger than the sum of their radii. In this case, one of the hadrons may emit a quasi-real photon that fluctuates into a quark-antiquark pair with the quantum numbers of the photon, which can then turn into a VM upon interacting with the other hadron. The interaction of the VM with the hadron proceeds via the exchange of the vacuum quantum numbers, the so-called pomeron exchange. Proton-lead (pPb) collisions are particularly interesting for studying photon-proton interactions [3,4] because the large electric charge of the Pb nucleus strongly enhances photon emission. Also, in these events, one can determine the photon direction and hence the photon-proton centre-of-mass energy W \u03b3 p unambiguously. This advantage is not present in e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch symmetric colliding systems such as pp interactions. Exclusive VM photoproduction is interesting because the Fourier transform of the t distribution, with t being the squared four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex, is related to the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the struck partons in the plane transverse to the beam direction. Furthermore, some models suggest that the energy dependence of the integrated cross section and that of the t distribution may provide evidence of gluon saturation, as discussed in Refs. [5][6][7][8][9][10].",

The LHCb Collaboration has studied exclusive J/\u03c8(1S), \u03c8(2S), and \u03a5 (nS) photoproduction in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [13,14]. Exclusive photoproduction of \u03c1 (770) 0 mesons was first studied in fixed-target experiments at W \u03b3 p values up to 20 GeV [15,16]. Experiments at the HERA electron-proton collider at DESY have studied this process at W \u03b3 p values ranging from 50 to 187 GeV, both with quasi-real photons and for photons with larger virtualities [17,18]. The HERA data have provided clear experimental evidence for the transition from the soft to the hard diffractive regime [19,20]. More recently, exclusive photoproduction of \u03c1 (770) 0 mesons has been studied by the STAR Collaboration in ultraperipheral AuAu collisions at the BNL RHIC collider [21][22][23], and by the ALICE Collaboration in PbPb collisions [24]. The cross sections measured by the ALICE and STAR Collaborations in photon-nucleus interactions are 40% lower than both the prediction from the Glauber approach and the corresponding measurements in photon-proton interactions [24,25]. However, the Glauber approach reproduces the measured cross sections well at lower energies. This is an indication that nuclei do not behave as a collection of independent nucleons at high energies. In the present analysis, exclusive photoproduction of \u03c1 (770) 0 mesons in the",

The invariant mass distribution is then unfolded using the iterative D'Agostini method [36], which is regularized by four iterations. In particular, the Bayesian iterative unfolding technique is used, as implemented in the roounfold package [37]. This procedure leads to corrections for experimental effects including possible data migration between bins. The response matrix is obtained from starlight. The average of the combined acceptance and efficiency is 0.13 and is almost independent of both p T and \u03b7, whereas it is sensitive to the invariant mass. The invariant mass shape of the \u03c1 (770) 0 in photoproduction deviates from that of a pure Breit-Wigner resonance [38]. Several parameterizations of the shape exist. One of the most often used is the S\u00f6ding formula [39], where a continuum amplitude B is added to a Breit-Wigner distribution. Following the recent results by the STAR Collaboration [23] and the earlier ones by the DESY-MIT Collaboration [40], a further relativistic Breit-Wigner component is added to account for \u03c9(783) photoproduction, followed by the decay",

If the fit is repeated without the \u03c9(783) \u2212 \u03c1 (770) 0 interference component, the result for |B/A| changes by less than its statistical uncertainty.

As mentioned in Sect. 5, the proton dissociative background template is obtained by requiring a signal in at least one of the forward detectors: HF, CAS-TOR, or ZDC. To calculate the systematic uncertainty related to the estimation of this background, the analysis is repeated five times and each time alternative combinations of forward detectors are used to obtain the proton dissociative template. The following variations are studied: (i) HF alone; (ii) CAS-TOR alone; (iii) ZDC alone; (iv) HF or CASTOR; (v) HF or ZDC. For each of these combinations the proton dissociative contributions are obtained in each |t| and rapidity bin. The maximum deviations from the nominal results are taken as conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty. The resulting effect on the integrated exclusive \u03c1 (770) 0 photoproduction cross section is smaller than 10%.",

The resulting cross section changes by up to 8%, depending on the rapidity and |t| interval studied. Another contribution to the model dependence uncertainty comes from the reweighting procedure of the starlight MC described in Sect. 6. This uncertainty is evaluated by varying the reweighting parameter b within its uncertainty; it is found to increase as a function of |t|, and reaches 32% for the highest |t| bin. The second contribution turns out to be dominant for all the rapidity and |t| intervals studied. The uncertainty in the extrapolation to the region |t| < 0.025 GeV 2 is model dependent. We estimated this uncertainty by studying different fitting functions to the differential cross section measurements. In particular, we studied a dipole form [28], a pure exponential e \u2212bt , and a modified exponential e \u2212bt+ct",

The CMS and HERA data are also fitted with the function \u03c3 = \u03b1W \u03b4 \u03b3 p as shown in Fig. 8. The fit yields \u03b4 = 0.24 \u00b1 0.13 (stat) \u00b10.04 (syst). Only statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are considered in these fits.  7700 photoproduction in the rapidity interval \u22121.2 < y \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 < 0. The square symbols indicate the H1 results, and the triangles the ZEUS results. The error bars show the statistical uncertainty, while the shaded areas represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. For the H1 data [18], the error bars represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature, and for the ZEUS data [17] the reported uncertainties are negligible",

The cross section for this process is measured in the photon-proton centre-  of-mass energy interval 29 < W \u03b3 p < 213 GeV. The results are consistent with those of the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at HERA, indicating that ion-proton collisions can be used in the same way as electron-proton ones, with ions acting as a source of quasi-real photons. The combination of the present data and the earlier, lower energy results agrees with theory-inspired fits. The differential cross section d\u03c3/d|t| for \u03c1 (770) 0 photoproduction is measured as a function of W \u03b3 p .   [45][46][47][48] and HERA [17,18] data are also shown.
