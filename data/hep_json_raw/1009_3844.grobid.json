            "text": "Measurements and theoretical descriptions of weak radiative hyperon decays have often disagreed. In 1964 Hara proved that \u03a3 + and \u039e \u2212 decay asymmetries vanish in the SU (3) limit [1]. Introducing weak breaking of SU(3) symmetry one expects to observe small decay asymmetries [2]. In contrast to this, a large negative decay asymmetry in the weak radiative decay \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u03b3 was first measured at Berkeley [3] and later confirmed [4]. To address this observation, several models were developed which tried to obtain large decay asymmetries in spite of weak SU(3) breaking. One category consists of pole models, which satisfy the Hara theorem by construction, and approaches based on chiral perturbation theory. These predict negative decay asymmetries for all weak radiative hyperon decays [5,6,7]. Calculations based on vector meson dominance and quark models, using measured data as input, are also able to describe the decay asymmetries in a consistent, but not yet fully satisfying picture [8,9]. For discrimination between these different approaches, precise experimental inputs are important.",
