A satisfactory description of the data is obtained when including a contribution representing an exotic \u03b7 c (1S)\u03c0 \u2212 resonant state. The significance of this exotic resonance is more than three standard deviations, while its mass and width are 4096 \u00b1 20 +18 \u221222 MeV and 152\u00b158 +60 \u221235 MeV, respectively. The spin-parity assignments J P = 0 + and J P = 1 \u2212 are both consistent with the data. In addition, the first measurement of the B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 c (1S)K + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction is performed and gives",

Different interpretations have been proposed about their nature [2][3][4], including their quark composition and binding mechanisms. In order to improve the understanding of these hadrons, it is important to search for new exotic candidates, along with new production mechanisms and decay modes of already observed unconventional states.",

            "text": "The Z c (3900) \u2212 state, discovered by the BESIII collaboration in the J/\u03c8 \u03c0 \u2212 final state [9], and confirmed by the Belle [10] and CLEO [11] collaborations, can be interpreted as a hadrocharmonium state, where the compact heavy quark-antiquark pair interacts with the surrounding light quark mesonic excitation by a QCD analogue of the van der Waals force [12]. This interpretation of the Z c (3900) \u2212 state predicts an as-yet-unobserved charged charmoniumlike state with a mass of approximately [3800]MeV whose dominant decay mode is to the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 system. 2 Alternatively, states like the Z c (3900) \u2212 meson could be interpreted as analogues of quarkonium hybrids, where the excitation of the gluon field (the valence gluon) is replaced by an isospin-1 excitation of the gluon and light-quark fields [13]. This interpretation, which is based on lattice QCD, predicts different multiplets of charmonium tetraquarks, comprising states with quantum numbers allowing the decay into the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 system. The \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 system carries isospin I = 1, G-parity G = \u22121, spin J = L and parity P = (\u22121) L , where L is the orbital angular momentum between the \u03b7 c and the \u03c0 \u2212 mesons. Lattice QCD calculations [14,15] predict the mass and quantum numbers of these states, comprising a I G (J P ) = 1 \u2212 (0 + ) state of mass [4025 \u00b1 49]MeV , a I G (J P ) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 ) state of mass [3770 \u00b1 42]MeV , and a I G (J P ) = 1 \u2212 (2 + ) state of mass [4045 \u00b1 44]MeV . The Z c (4430) \u2212 resonance, discovered by the Belle collaboration [16] and confirmed by LHCb [17,18], could also fit into this scenario. Another prediction of a possible exotic candidate decaying to the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 system is provided by the diquark model [19], where quarks and diquarks are the fundamental units to build a rich spectrum of hadrons, including the exotic states observed thus far. The diquark model predicts a J P = 0 + candidate below the open-charm threshold that could decay into the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 final state. Therefore, the discovery of a charged charmonium-like meson in the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 sys- In this article, the B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 c K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay is studied for the first time, with the \u03b7 c meson reconstructed using the p p decay mode. The decay is expected to proceed through K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 intermediate states, where K * 0 refers to any neutral kaon resonance, following the diagram shown in Fig. 1a. If the decay also proceeds through exotic resonances in the \u03b7 c \u03c0 \u2212 system, denoted by Z \u2212 c states in the following, a diagram like that shown in Fig. 1b would contribute. The B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 c K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay involves only pseudoscalar mesons, hence it is fully described by two independent kinematic quantities. Therefore, the Dalitz plot (DP) analysis technique [20] can be used to completely characterise the decay.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system con-sisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ringimaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a hadron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-tracks secondary vertex with a significant displacement from any PV. At least one charged particle must have a large transverse momentum and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [24,25] is used to identify secondary vertices that are consistent with b-hadron decays.",

The p p invariant-mass distribution of \u03b7 c candidates is described by the convolution of a nonrelativistic Breit-Wigner function and a Gaussian function describing resolution effects. Using simulated samples, the p p invariant-mass resolution is found to be \u2248 [5]MeV . Given the width \u03b7 c = [32.0 \u00b1 0.8]MeV [8], the impact of the detector resolution on the \u03b7 c lineshape is small. The J/\u03c8 resonance, having a small natural width, is parametrised using an Hypatia function, with tail parameters fixed to the values obtained from the corresponding simulated sample. The same resolution parameter is used for the \u03b7 c and J/\u03c8 contributions, which is free to vary in the fit to the data. The \u03b7 c and J/\u03c8 masses are also floating, while the \u03b7 c natural width is Gaussian constrained to the known value [8]. The NR B 0 \u2192 p pK + \u03c0 \u2212 contribution is parametrised with an exponential function with the slope free to vary in the fit. All yields are left unconstrained in the fit. A possible term describing the interference between the \u03b7 c resonance and the NR p p S-wave is investigated and found to be negligible. The result of the fit to the weighted p p invariant-mass distribution is shown in Fig. 3.

A new value of the ratio R is computed for each source of systematic uncertainty, and its difference with the nominal value is taken as the associated systematic uncertainty. The overall systematic uncertainty is assigned by combining all contributions in quadrature. The systematic uncertainty arising from fixing the shape parameters of the Hypatia functions used to parametrise the B 0 and J/\u03c8 components is evaluated by repeating the fits and varying all shape parameters simultaneously.
