A special dataset recorded in 2012 with a small number of interactions per beam crossing (below 0.004) and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 160 \u00b5b \u22121 was used. A minimumbias trigger was utilised to select a data sample of more than 9 million collision events. The multiplicity, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles are shown in different regions of kinematics and chargedparticle multiplicity, including measurements of final states at high multiplicity. The results are corrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generator models which simulate the full hadronic final state.",

Multiple parton-parton interactions (MPI) contribute to multiplicity fluctuations and are simulated as part of the ND processes. The diffractive processes consist of single-diffractive dissociation (SD) and double-diffractive dissociation (DD). Pythia 8 is used with the A2 [27] and Monash [28] tunes. The A2 tune was performed on minimum-bias and underlyingevent data, utilising the MSTW2008 LO [29] parton distribution function (PDF). The Monash tune was made using a re-analysis of fragmentation-sensitive measurements with e + e \u2212 collisions, combined with minimumbias and underlying-event tuning for hadron-hadron data, utilising the NNPDF23LO PDF. Pythia 6 employs the AMBT2B [30] tune with the CTEQ6L1 [31] PDF. The AMBT2B tune was evaluated using jet and minimumbias data. \u2022 Epos [32]. This model implements a parton-based Gribov-Regge theory [33], which is an effective QCDinspired field theory describing hard and soft scattering simultaneously. Epos has been primarily designed for Pb+Pb interactions and cosmic air showers. The LHC tune [34] is used here, which modifies the modelling of radial flow to be more applicable for small-volume, highdensity regions, as are found in pp interactions. \u2022 Qgsjet-II [35] using the default tune. This model provides a phenomenological treatment of hadronic and nuclear interactions within a Reggeon field theory framework, and includes soft and semi-hard parton processes within the \"semi-hard pomeron\" approach. Qgsjet-II was also developed for the simulation of cosmic rays. Qgsjet-II and Epos calculations do not rely on the standard PDFs as used in the Pythia generators.",

A number of further quality criteria were also applied. The track must have at least one hit in the pixel detector. A hit in the innermost layer of the pixel detector was required should the extrapolated track have passed through an active region in that layer. At least two, four or six SCT hits are required to be associated with a track for 100 < p T \u2264 200 MeV, 200 < p T \u2264 300 MeV, or p T > 300 MeV, respectively. The SCT hit requirements are relaxed in the event of a track trajectory passing through inactive SCT modules. The probability of the track hypothesis being correct, estimated using the track fit \u03c7 2 and n dof , was required to be greater than 0.01 for p T > 10 GeV in order to remove tracks with a mis-measured high p T due to interactions with the material or combinatorial fake highp T tracks. The distance of closest approach in the transverse (|d PV 0 |) and the longitudinal plane (|z PV 0 \u2022 sin \u03b8 |) was also required to be less than 1.5 mm with respect to the primary vertex. These constraints reduce the total fraction of non-primary tracks in the data from around 6 to 2 % (see Sect. 6). The average efficiency to reconstruct a track above p T > 100 MeV is approximately 70 %. The efficiency of the two impact param- eter requirements is around 94 %, i.e. applied together they remove approximately 6 % of all tracks that would pass the other track selection criteria. Figure 1a shows the normalised distribution of all selected tracks as a function of pseudorapidity in the most inclusive phase space. The models reproduce the data well with discrepancies in \u03b7 at a level of up to 3 %, which stem from the imperfect description of the p T spectra ( The distributions of the average number of hits per reconstructed track in data and MC simulation as a function of pseudorapidity are shown in Fig. 10 in Appendix A, using events selected for the most inclusive phase space.",

The reconstruction efficiency of these short-lived particles and their decay products is strongly momentumdependent and close to zero for most particles within the measured kinematic range. However, the predicted fraction of the total generated particles associated with charged strange baryons varies with p T as well as between MC models. For example, the fractions predicted by Pythia 8 A2 and Epos LHC are 5 and 13 %, respectively for p T \u223c 5 GeV. To lower the model dependence on the overall track reconstruction efficiency, the contribution of such particles to the distributions under study was excluded from the measurement definition. The residual small contamination of reconstructed tracks, which is less than 0.01 % in \u03b7 and up to 5 % at high transverse momentum (30 < p T < 50 GeV), was estimated from simulation using Epos LHC and subtracted, and a systematic uncertainty was assigned following comparisons of the predictions of different MC models.",

The trigger efficiency was therefore parameterised as a function of n BS sel , which is defined as the number of tracks in an event that satisfy all track quality criteria; however, instead of the nominal requirements for the impact parameters d PV 0 and z PV 0 , only a constraint on the transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam spot, |d BS 0 | < 1.8 mm, was applied in order to minimise correlations between the trigger and vertex efficiency corrections.",

In order to maximise the recorded data yield, both triggers were combined such that either of the two triggers was required to trigger the event, in which case the corresponding trigger efficiency was applied; this was done due to pre-scale factors that evolved differently for each trigger during the run. The result for the trigger requirement in which the signal in at least one of the MBTS modules was above threshold is presented in Fig. 3a as a function of n BS sel for the most inclusive phase space. In the p T > 500 MeV phase space, the efficiency was measured to be above 98 % for n BS sel = 1 and it rises more rapidly to 100 % at higher track multiplicities than in the most inclusive phase space. The efficiency for the trigger requirement in which a signal above threshold was required in at least two of the MBTS modules is lower by about 4 % for the (n BS sel = 2, p T > 100 MeV) event category, and about 2 % lower for events with n BS sel = 1 and p T > 500 MeV.

The shape of the \u03b7 distribution is strongly affected by the amount of material traversed by charged particles, in particular the passive material in supporting structures between the Pixel and SCT detector.

This is the dominant uncertainty on 1/N ev \u2022 dN ch /d\u03b7, and the leading or next-toleading uncertainty in all other distributions. \u2022 Different p T spectra in the MC models and data lead to differences of up to 2 % in the average track reconstruction efficiency per n ch interval. For the final dN ev /dn ch spectra in the most inclusive phase space, this effect becomes as large as 12 % at the highest multiplicities. \u2022 The relative uncertainty on the fraction of non-primary tracks is 15 %, while the relative uncertainty on the fraction of reconstructed strange baryons is 50 %, as described in Sect. 6. The total uncertainty of both sources in the corrected distributions is 3.5 % or smaller and is not a dominant uncertainty in any region. \u2022 Different particle types have different reconstruction efficiencies. For example, at p T \u223c 1 GeV the reconstruction efficiency of charged pions is \u223c 82 %, whereas for kaons and protons it is \u223c80 and \u223c75 %, respectively. Although the MC generators give consistent efficiencies, the relative fractions of these generated particles vary between the models. For example, Pythia 8 A2 (Epos LHC ) gives fractions of 77 % (72 %), 14 % (18 %) and 9 % (10 %) for generated pions, kaons and protons, respectively, at p T \u223c 1 GeV. Differences in particle composition therefore lead to an uncertainty on the overall track reconstruction efficiency, which varies between 0.2 and 1 % for the corrected distributions. This is not a dominant uncertainty in any region. \u2022 Systematic uncertainties on the overall track reconstruction efficiency that are associated with the choice of track-particle matching algorithms (0.4 %) and the choice of physics models for MC simulation (0.3 %) are also accounted for, and are not a dominant uncertainty in any region of the corrected distributions. \u2022 To account for momentum resolution differences between data and MC simulation, which can arise, for example, via imperfect knowledge of the detector alignment, an uncertainty of 5 % was assigned to tracks with p T < 150 MeV.",

With the fiducial definition of primary charged particles that was used in this study (\u03c4 > 300 ps), the central primary-charged-particle multiplicity at \u03b7 = 0 per event and unit of pseudorapidity was measured to be 5.64 \u00b1 0.10 in events containing n ch \u2265 2 primary charged particles with transverse momentum p T > 100 MeV, and Table 1 Central primary-charged-particle density 1/N ev \u2022 dN ch /d\u03b7 at \u03b7 = 0 for five different phase spaces.

The precision of these results is 30-40 % better than for the previous highest precision ATLAS measurements at 0.9 and 7 TeV. Compared with earlier studies, this paper also presents ATLAS measurements of final states at high multiplicities of n ch \u2265 20 and n ch \u2265 50. Predictions of various Monte Carlo models were compared with the data, and it was found that the best description is given by the Epos LHC tune, followed by the Pythia 8 A2 and Monash tunes. The measurements presented here are expected to provide valuable constraints for the tuning and further understanding of soft QCD physics models. of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
