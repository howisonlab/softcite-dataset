The CP asymmetries are measured to be S f = 0.058 \u00b1 0.020(stat) \u00b1 0.011(syst) and Sf = 0.038 \u00b1 0.020(stat) \u00b1 0.007(syst). These results are in agreement with, and more precise than, previous determinations. They are used to constrain angles of the unitarity triangle, | sin (2\u03b2 + \u03b3) | and \u03b3, to intervals that are consistent with the current world-average values.",

For an initially produced B 0 meson, the same equations hold except for a change of sign of the coefficients in front of the sine and cosine functions. No CP violation in the decay is assumed, i.e. only tree-level processes contribute to the decay amplitudes. It is also assumed that |q/p| = 1, where q and p are the complex coefficients defining the heavy and light mass eigenstates of the B 0 system, and \u2206\u0393 = 0, where \u2206\u0393 is the decay-width difference between the two mass eigenstates. These assumptions follow from the known values of these quantities [6]. Under these assumptions, the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms of eq. (1.1) are given by where \u03b4 is the CP -conserving phase difference between theb \u2192cud andb \u2192\u016bcd decay amplitudes.

The most relevant variables entering the BDT are the quality of the fit of the B 0 vertex and that of the kinematic fit to calculate the B 0 decay time, the transverse momentum of the D \u2212 candidate, and the quality of the fit of the companion-particle track. The requirement placed on the BDT response is chosen to maximise the expected sensitivity to S f and Sf as derived from a set of simulated samples of signal plus background that are passed through the entire analysis.

Each tagging decision is weighted by the estimated mistag probability \u03b7, which dilutes the sensitivity to the CP asymmetry. To correct for potential biases in \u03b7, a function \u03c9 (\u03b7) is used to calibrate the mistag probability which provides an unbiased estimate of the mistag fraction \u03c9 (\u03c9), i.e. the fraction of incorrectly tagged candidates for a B 0 (B 0 ) meson, for any value of \u03b7.",

This can result in different tagging efficiencies and mistag probabilities for initial B 0 and B 0 mesons. Asymmetries in the tagging efficiency are found to be consistent with zero in simulation and data for both taggers and are therefore neglected in the baseline fit, but considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. This is not the case for the asymmetries of the mistag probability, which can bias the determination of the CP asymmetries and must be corrected for.

In both cases, distributions of p T and pseudorapidity of the B 0 candidate, number of tracks and PVs in the event, and the composition of software trigger decisions are weighted to match those of the B 0 \u2192 D \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 signal sample.
