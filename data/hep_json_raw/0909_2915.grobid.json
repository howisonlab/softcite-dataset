The charged current pion production interactions account for the biggest background for the neutrino oscillation disappearance measurements. Recently, three experiments (K2K [2], MiniBooNE [3,4] and SciBooNE [5,6]) have presented results for CC pion production cross section in the few-GeV neutrino energy region on nuclear targets. With high statistic samples it is possible to determine neutrino cross sections in this region with better precision than data from previous experiments [7,8,9] . Here, we present the ratio of cross sections of the charged current single pion production (CCl;r+, v^X -^ ji^n^X') and quasielastic scattering {CCQE, v^n -^ jJ-^p) as obtained from the MiniBooNE experiment. In this measurement the largest sources of uncertainty coming from the neutrino flux determination largely cancels out.",

CCQE interactions on carbon are generated using the relativistic Fermi gas model [13] tuned to better describe the observed distribution of CCQE interactions in MiniBooNE [14]. Resonant CCl;r+ events are simulated using the Rein and Sehgal (R-S) model [15], as implemented in NUANCE with an axial mass Ml\"'= 1.1 GeV. The angular distribution of the decaying pions in the center of mass of the recoUing resonance foUows the heficity ampfitudes of [16]. In MiniBooNE, 87% of CCl;r+ production is predicted to occur via the A(1232) resonance, but 17 higher mass resonances and their interferences, as well as a nonresonant background that accounts for roughly 6% of CCl;r+ events, are also included in the model. Coherently produced CCl;r+ events are generated using the R-S model [16] with the R-S absorptive factor replaced by NUANCE'S pion absorption model and the overaU cross section rescaled to reproduce MiniBooNE's recent measurement of neuttal current coherent ;r\u00b0 production [17]. Coherent ;r+ production is predicted to compose less than 6% of the MiniBooNE CCl;r+ sample due to the smaU coherent cross section [18,19] and the dominance of the A++ resonance. A GEANT3-based detector model simulates the response of the detector to particles produced in these neuttino interactions. ",

Solely for the purpose of comparison, we now extract a similarly corrected value. The FSI-corrected ratio is defined as the ratio of CCl;r+ to CCQE events at the initial vertex and before any hadronic re-interactions. Thus, the signal fractions and cut efficiencies for the FSI-corrected ratio include corrections for intra-nuclear hadron re-scattering based on the MC's model for nuclear effects [12]. The measurement proceeds exactly as for the observed ratio, except that now we define CCln^ and CCQE, rather than CCl;r+-like and CCgS-like, events as signal for the respective samples.",

Our result agrees with both ANL, which used a deuterium target, and K2K, which used C^H^. In order to make this comparison, the MiniBooNE and K2K results have been re-scaled to an isoscalar target. To perform this correction, we rescale the ratio by a factor of (1 -r)i'p, where r is the ratio of neutrons to protons in the target and Sp is the fraction of ;r+ production that is predicted (by MC) to occur on protons. The resulting scaling factor is 0.80 for MiniBooNE; for K2K we use the factor of 0.89 provided in [9]. The results have not been corrected for their differing nuclear targets nor for the application of explicit invariant mass requirements (although the latter are similar). ANL used an explicit cut on invariant mass W < 1.4 GeV [7] . While no invariant mass cut is used in this analysis, the MiniBooNE spectrum is such that CCln^ events occur only in the region W <\\.6 GeV; similarly, K2K's measurement covers the region W < 2 GeV [9] .",
