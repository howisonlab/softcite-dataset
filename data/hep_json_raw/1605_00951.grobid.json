Total cross-sections are measured and combined into charge ratios, asymmetries, and ratios of W +jet and Z+jet production cross-sections. Differential measurements are also performed as a function of both boson and jet kinematic variables. All results are in agreement with Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "Measurements of vector boson production in association with jets in the forward region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be used to test the Standard Model (SM) and provide constraints on the parton density functions (PDFs). LHCb is the only detector at the LHC with precision tracking coverage in the forward region, allowing sensitivity to PDFs at a different range of Bjorken-x compared to ATLAS and CMS [1]. LHCb measurements typically probe PDFs at x as low as 10 \u22124 and at high x [2]. This article reports total and differential cross-section measurements of W and Z production in association with jets, hereafter referred to as W j and Zj, respectively. 1 The measurements are performed using data collected during 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s =8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.98 \u00b1 0.02 fb \u22121 . The W and Z bosons are identified through the W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decay channels. This work extends measurements of the Zj production cross-section at 7 TeV [3,4] and ratios of the production cross-sections at 7 and 8 TeV [5]. It also complements previous studies of inclusive electroweak boson production at LHCb, where the electroweak bosons decay to muons [6][7][8].",

For W boson decays, this corresponds to requiring that the muon has a pseudorapidity, \u03b7 \u00b5 , in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 \u00b5 < 4.5 and transverse momentum, p \u00b5 T , greater than 20 GeV. 2 For Z boson decays, both muons are required to fulfil these kinematic requirements, and in addition, the dimuon invariant mass, M \u00b5\u00b5 , is required to be in the range 60 < M \u00b5\u00b5 < 120 GeV. The fiducial criteria for these measurements require at least one jet to have transverse momentum p jet T > 20 GeV, and jet pseudorapidity, \u03b7 jet , in the range 2.2 < \u03b7 jet < 4.2. The jet is also required to be separated by a radius \u2206R of 0.5 from the charged lepton(s) produced in the boson decay, where \u2206R is the sum in quadrature of the difference in pseudorapidity and the difference in azimuthal angle between the jet and the lepton. In addition, the W j measurement requires that the transverse component of the vector sum of the muon and jet momenta, p \u00b5+j T , is greater than 20 GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T algorithm [9], with the R parameter set to 0.5. Jet energies are defined at the hadron level, and do not include the contribution of neutrinos in the jet.",

For the Zj measurement, the differential cross-sections are determined as a function of p jet T , \u03b7 jet , the boson rapidity, y Z , and the difference in azimuthal angle between the Z boson and the jet, |\u2206\u03c6|. The jet transverse momentum distributions and the |\u2206\u03c6| distribution tend to be sensitive to higher-order effects within perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [10], while measurements of the (pseudo)rapidity distributions are sensitive to the PDFs that parameterise the structure of the proton. The ratio of the W + j to the W \u2212 j cross-sections is measured, as is the ratio of the W j cross-sections to the Zj cross-section.

The efficiency of the GEC requirement at the hardware stage of the trigger is again evaluated in a similar fashion to the inclusive analyses, where the efficiency is measured in a Zj sample selected with a looser trigger requirement [6][7][8].

The correction is determined from simulation as the ratio of events produced in a specific bin to those recorded by the detector in the same bin. The correction varies between 0.9 and 1.0, where the largest corrections are seen at low p jet T and in the highest and lowest \u03b7 jet bins. For the Zj sample, the acceptance factor, A i , is identically equal to unity as the selection mirrors the fiducial acceptance exactly. In the case of the W j selection, the requirement of p \u00b5-jet+j T > 20 GeV differs from the fiducial requirement of p \u00b5+j T > 20 GeV. Consequently, the acceptance factor accounts for differences between these two variables arising from extra activity that may be present in the neighbourhood of the signal muon. This factor is evaluated using simulation, which is reweighted in bins of jet p T and pseudorapidity to match next-to-leading order predictions obtained from aMC@NLO.

A similar level of agreement is observed between data and simulation by comparing kinematic distributions in regions with enhanced fake-jet populations. The uncertainty in the muon reconstruction efficiency is determined by re-evaluating the cross-section with the total efficiency varied by one standard deviation around the central value. An additional 1% systematic uncertainty is also applied to account for differences in efficiencies observed between inclusive Z events and Zj events. The uncertainty on the jet reconstruction efficiency is evaluated by comparing the differences in efficiency between Zj data and simulation where the quality requirements are varied about their nominal values. This results in an uncertainty of 1.9%. The uncertainty on the selection efficiency, 1%, includes the statistical uncertainty due to the limited size of the \"pseudo-W j\" data sample and the uncertainty on the corrections evaluated from simulation for differences between W j and \"pseudo-W j\" events. The uncertainty on the GEC efficiency is taken to be the sum in quadrature of the accuracy of the method, 0.3% [7,8], and the difference observed between W + j, W \u2212 j and Zj events in simulation, typically smaller than 0.2%. The uncertainty on the efficiency with which jets are selected is evaluated by varying the selection requirements and determining how the fraction of events rejected agrees between data and simulation, using the methods described in ref.

The difference is typically 0.8-1.5%, depending on the distribution considered.

An additional uncertainty due to the resolution of the jet pseudorapidity in data is also considered and obtained by comparing the difference between the jet pseudorapidity calculated using just the charged component of the jet and using both the charged and neutral components in Zj data and simulation.

The calorimeter energy scales are modelled to an accuracy of better than 10%. This is confirmed by comparing the fraction of p jet T carried by neutral final-state particles between data and simulation, and evaluating how much the calorimeter response can be varied before disagreement is observed. The jet energy resolution at LHCb is modelled in simulation to an accuracy of about 10% [3,5]. The analysis is repeated with the simulated p jet T smeared by 10%; the change in the final result of approximately 0.3% is assigned as the relevant uncertainty. Combining these effects yields an energy scale uncertainty of about 3%, consistent with previous studies [3] considering the p T balance in Z +1-jet events. In order to determine the effect on the measurement, the analysis is repeated with the energy scale varied to cover possible differences between data and simulation.

            "text": "Measurements of the forward W and Z boson cross-sections in association with jets at \u221a s = 8 TeV are presented. The W bosons are reconstructed in the decay W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 and the Z bosons in the decay Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5. Total cross-sections are presented in the forward fiducial region in addition to measurements of the charge ratio and asymmetry of W j production and the ratio of W j to Zj production. Differential cross-sections are presented as a function of p jet T , \u03b7 jet , \u03b7 \u00b5 in the case of W j production, and for Zj production, where a full reconstruction of the final state is possible, measurements are presented as a function of p jet T , \u03b7 jet , y Z , and the azimuthal separation of the Z boson and the jet, |\u2206\u03c6|. The W j charge ratio and asymmetry are presented as a function of \u03b7 \u00b5 . All measurements are observed to be in agreement with predictions obtained at O(\u03b1 2 s ) interfaced with a parton shower in order to achieve NLO plus leading-log accuracy. The measurements of the charge ratio and asymmetry of W j production are also compared to predictions obtained at O(\u03b1 2 s ) in fixed order perturbative QCD and show good agreement.    Figure 5. The measured bin-averaged differential Zj production cross-section is shown as a function of (left) \u03b7 jet and (right) p jet T . The experimental measurements are shown as bands, while the theoretical predictions are shown as points, horizontally displaced for presentation. The ratio of the predicted to measured cross-sections is shown below the distribution.",
