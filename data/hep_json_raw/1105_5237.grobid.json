A 95% confidence level combined lower limit is set on the mass of a first generation scalar leptoquark at 339 GeV for \u03b2 = 0.5, where \u03b2 is the branching fraction of the leptoquark to an electron and a quark.

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics has an intriguing but ad hoc symmetry between quarks and leptons. In some theories beyond the SM, such as SU(5) grand unification [1],   [2], composite models [3], technicolor [4][5][6], and superstring-inspired E 6 models [7], the existence of a new symmetry relates the quarks and leptons in a fundamental way. These models predict the existence of new bosons, called leptoquarks. The leptoquark (LQ) is coloured, has fractional electric charge, and couples to a lepton and a quark with coupling strength \u03bb. The leptoquark decays to a charged lepton and a quark, with unknown branching fraction \u03b2, or a neutrino and a quark, with branching fraction (1 \u2212 \u03b2). A review of LQ phenomenology and searches can be found in Refs. [8,9]. Constraints from experiments sensitive to flavour-changing neutral currents, lepton-family-number violation, and other rare processes [10] favour LQs that couple to quarks and leptons within the same SM generation, for LQ masses accessible to current colliders.",

Prior to the results of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, direct limits on the mass of the first generation scalar LQ have also been set by the Tevatron [13,14] and LEP [15][16][17][18] experiments, assuming prompt LQ decay. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment published a stricter lower limit of 384 GeV [19] on the mass of first generation scalar LQs for \u03b2 = 1 in the dielectron-plus-dijet (eejj) channel, using a sample collected in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 33 pb \u22121 . Recently, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC has also obtained an exclusion on the mass of first generation scalar LQs [20]. This Letter presents the results of a search for pair-production of first generation scalar LQs using events containing an electron, missing transverse energy, and at least two jets (e\u03bdjj) using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In proton-proton collisions at the LHC, LQs are predominantly pair-produced via gluongluon fusion with a cross section that depends on the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s but is nearly independent of \u03bb. This cross section depends on the mass of the LQ and has been calculated at the next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD [21]. LQs could also be produced singly with a cross section that is dependent on \u03bb. The results of this study are based on the assumption that \u03bb is sufficiently small that single-LQ production can be neglected. The data were collected in 2010 by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 . The eejj and e\u03bdjj combined results are also presented.",

The polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive z-axis and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured in the xy plane. Pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, of 6 m internal diameter, providing a field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry. The ECAL has an energy resolution of better than 0.5% for unconverted photons with transverse energies above 100 GeV, and 3% or better for electrons of energies relevant to this analysis. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have granularity \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 = 0.087 \u00d7 0.087 (where \u03c6 is measured in radians). In the (\u03b7, \u03c6) plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystals arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. The muons are measured in the pseudorapidity window |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made of three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching the muons to the tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a transverse momentum (p T ) resolution between 1 and 5%, for p T values up to 1 TeV. The inner tracker measures charged particles within |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and provides an impact parameter resolution of \u223c 15 \u03bcm and a p T resolution of about 1.5% for 100 GeV particles. Events must pass a first-level trigger made of a system of fast electronics and a high-level trigger that consists of a farm of commercial CPUs running a version of the offline reconstruction software optimized for timing considerations.

The systematic uncertainty on trigger, reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiency for electrons is assessed using Z \u2192 ee events from data, using methods similar to those discussed in Ref. [43]. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity of the data sample is 4% [44]. The effect of the PDF uncertainties on the signal acceptance is estimated using an event reweighting technique that uses the LHAPDF package [45] and it is found to be negligible (less than 1%). Uncertainties on the signal acceptance due to the presence of additional hadronic jets produced as a result of QCD radiation in the initial and final states are negligible.

An upper limit on the LQ cross section in the absence of the leptoquark signal is therefore set using a Bayesian approach [40] featuring a flat signal prior, Poisson statistics, and log-normal priors to integrate over the systematic uncertainties marginalized as nuisance parameters. The systematic uncertainties for the background are dominated by the tt and W + jets normalization uncertainty and the uncertainty on the W + jets background shape. Systematic uncertainties on the signal efficiency are dominated by the uncertainty on the electron selection efficiencies and the jet energy scale. Fig. 2 (left) and Table 4 show the 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit on the LQ pair-production cross section times 2\u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2)",

The contribution of the main backgrounds has been determined by MC studies and the uncertainty estimated by a comparison with the data. The number of observed events passing a selection optimized for exclusion of the LQ hypothesis is in good agreement with the predictions for standard model background processes. A Bayesian approach that includes treatment of the systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters has been used to set upper limits on the LQ cross section. Prior CMS results in the dielectron channel are combined with this electron + neutrino search. A 95% confidence level combined lower limit is set on the mass of a first generation scalar leptoquark at 339 GeV for \u03b2 = 0.5. These results represent the most stringent direct limits to date for values of \u03b2 greater than 0.05.",
