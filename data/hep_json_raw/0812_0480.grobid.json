Moreover, decays to final states containing kaons provide a direct determination of the strange quark mass and Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element |V us | [1,2,3]. Although the measurements of the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay from CLEO used sufficiently large statistics, the overall uncertainty is as large as \u223c10% [4]. Furthermore, the branching ratio of this decay, recently measured by BABAR [5], is visibly smaller than the previous world average value [6]. The resonant states in \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay have been studied only with poor statistics by CLEO [7]. The resonance study is itself of interest for strange spectral function measurements and leptonic CP violation studies. Theoretically, two intermediate resonances, the \u03c1(770) and K * 0 (892), are both expected to contribute to tau decay into K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 : \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c1 0 (770)(\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03bd \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 (\u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 [8].

Since 1999, the Belle experiment has accumulated approximately 850 fb \u22121 data until the summer of 2008. The Belle detector is a largesolid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a super-conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [10]. In this study, we used 668.9 fb \u22121 data collected on the \u03a5(4S) resonance, 10.58 GeV, and 60 MeV below it (off-resonance), which corresponds to the production of 6.15 \u00d7 10 8 \u03c4 -pairs.",

Also the detector response of all MC data sets is simulated with the GEANT [13] simulator. The TAUOLA generator uses a decay model for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 , where the process is mediated by K 1 (1270) and K 1 (1410) resonances and their interference (we will call this decay model as \"normal\" decay model, in the following). To check for a possible bias of efficiency due to the specific decay model used, events assuming phase-space decay of \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 were also generated using the KKMC program. The evaluated efficiencies for M(K\u03c0\u03c0) for both cases are compared in Fig. 5. The relative difference of efficiencies between the normal decay and the phase space decay is around 1 %, so small that it is negligible.",

For all cases, the uncertainty of the track finding efficiency is the most important source of systematic uncertainty, which is estimated from the comparison of real and MC data for D * \u2192 \u03c0D 0 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0K 0 S (K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decay sample.

The effect of the uncertainty of luminosity and cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 [15] are rather small, because we used { e, \u00b5 } events for the normalization.

The uncertainty due to gamma veto is evaluated by using the different selection criteria of gamma energy.

The results are based on the 669 fb \u22121 \u03c4 pair sample collected by the Belle detector. The result for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay mode is compared with previous measurements in Fig. 11. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are compatible with a recent precision measurement from BABAR, although the branching ratio of this study is more consistent with the previous world average values.  +3.2/-3.0 +3.2/-3.0 +3.2/-3.0 +3.1/-2.9 Efficiency matrix and PID +1.5/-1.5 +1.7/-1.7 +1.9/-1.9 +2. +3.7/-3.6 +4.9/-4.7 +3.9/-3.7 +4.0/-3.9 Branching ratio \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 (8.41 \u00b1 0.00(stat.) +0.34 \u22120.33 (sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 (3.25 \u00b1 0.02(stat.) +0.16 \u22120.15 (sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 (1.53 \u00b1 0.01(stat.) +0.06 \u22120.06 (sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K + K \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 (2.60 \u00b1 0.23(stat.) +0. 10 \u22120.10 (sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22125",

The cross-feed background components are re-scaled using the branching ratio value calculated above.Table IIIsummarizes the various contributions to the systematic uncertainties on the branching ratio. For all cases, the uncertainty of the track finding efficiency is the most important source of systematic uncertainty, which is estimated from the comparison of real and MC data for D * \u2192 \u03c0D 0 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0K 0 S (K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decay sample. The uncertainty of the efficiency migration matrix includes that of the kaon identification efficiency and lepton identification efficiency, which are important sources of the systematic errors. The uncertainty of the kaon identification efficiency is evaluated from the comparison of real and MC data for D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + s , and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + events, while \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 /\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events are used for the estimation of lepton identification efficiency uncertainty. The effect of the uncertainty of luminosity and cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212[15] are rather small, because we used { e, \u00b5 } events for the normalization.
