Measurement of these neutrinos provides powerful constraints on the radiogenic heat of the Earth and tests on the Earth models. Since the prediction of\u03bde's in geoneutrino flux is subject to neutrino oscillation effects, we performed a calculation including detailed oscillation analysis in the propagation of geoneutrinos and reactor neutrinos generated around the Earth. The expected geoneutrino signal, the reactor neutrino background rates and the systematic error budget are provided for a proposed 3-kiloton neutrino detector at the Jinping underground lab in Sichuan, China. In addition, we evaluated sensitivities for the geoneutrino flux, Th/U ratio and power of a possible fission reactor in the interior of the Earth.",

The Earth surface heat flow is currently estimated to be 46 \u00b1 3 TW [2,3]. The driving power comes mainly from the radiogenic energy of the heat producing elements (HPE) potassium, thorium and uranium, and the initial inheritance of primordial energy that resulted from the accretion of the planet and the gravitational differentiation of metal sinking to the center of the Earth.",

Both studies disfavor the Earth model that driving power comes only from radiogenic energy, yet cannot distinguish among the predictions due to the detection uncertainty contributed mainly by the low statistics, the backgrounds, and the uncertainty of HPE distribution in the Earth. In addition, the ratio of uranium and thorium in geoneutrinos are still limited by the low statistics and the backgrounds. Additional experimental approaches are needed.",

Also, the difference in the geoneutrino energy spectrum discussed in Sec. II does not influence the detection result with the IBD detection method. The prompt positron will decelerate and annihilate with an electron, yielding gammas. The energy deposited in the detector by the deceleration and annihilation of the positron, called visible energy, can be approximately calculated by E vis = E\u03bd e \u22120.784 MeV. Here, E vis is the visible energy of the positron, and E\u03bd e is the initial neutrino energy. The tiny neutron recoil energy is neglected. The neutron is detected via neutron capture on hydrogen or another nuclide. For a liquid scintillator or slow liquid scintillator [31], the neutron capture is on hydrogen, which generates a single gamma of 2.2 MeV. A typical target proton number is 7.2 \u00d7 10 31 / kiloton for a slow scintillator. To avoid redundant scaling between different target masses and live times, the unit Terrestrial Neutrino Unit (TNU) is introduced for the electron antineutrino events detected via the IBD reaction in the geoneutrino calculation. 1 TNU = 1 event / 10 32 protons / 1 year, assuming 100% detection efficiency. The IBD event rates in Jinping are calculated as",

At present, the Earth model contributes \u00b115.0% uncertainty for crustal geoneutrino prediction, while oscillation parameters contribute +1.8% \u22121.7% . Nearly 50% of the geoneutrino signals comes within 300 km distance from the detector [26]; therefore, a clear understanding of the local geological environment is fundamentally important. The local geology around Jinping has been heavily studied because of the many devastating earthquakes in the region, and still requires further effort toward an accurate local lithospheric model. With improvements on local crust composition and oscillation parameters, supposing an optimistic \u00b11.0% uncertainty in the Earth model, and \u00b11.0% uncertainty in oscillation parameters, this test on BSE models will be significantly improved as shown by the dashed dotted lines in Fig. 6.
