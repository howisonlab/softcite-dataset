No evidence is seen for either state. Upper limits on the ratios of the production cross-sections of the B c (2 1 S 0 ) + and B c (2 3 S 1 ) + states times the branching fractions of B c (2 1 S 0 ) + \u2192 B + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B c (2 3 S 1 ) + \u2192 B * + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 over the production cross-section of the B + c state are given as a function of their masses. They are found to be between 0.02 and 0.14 at 95% confidence level for B c (2 1 S 0 ) + and B c (2 3 S 1 ) + in the mass ranges [6830, 6890]  MeV/c 2 and [6795, 6890] MeV/c 2 , respectively.",

            "text": "The B c meson family is unique in the Standard Model, as its states contain two different heavy-flavour valence quarks. It has a rich spectroscopy, predicted by various models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] and lattice QCD [15]. The ground state of the B c meson family, the B + c meson, was first observed by the CDF experiment [16,17] at the Tevatron collider in 1998. 1 Recently, the ATLAS collaboration reported observation of an excited B c state with a mass of 6842 \u00b1 4 (stat) \u00b1 5 (syst) MeV/c 2 [18]. Since the production cross-section of the B c (2 3 S 1 ) + state is predicted to be more than twice that of the B c (2 1 S 0 ) + state [8,13,19,20], the most probable interpretation of the single peak is either a signal for B c (2 3 S 1 ) + \u2192 B * + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , followed by B * + c \u2192 B + c \u03b3 with a missing low-energy photon, or an unresolved pair of peaks from the decays B c (2 1 S 0 ) + \u2192 B + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B c (2 3 S 1 ) + \u2192 B * + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . 2 The B c (2 1 S 0 ) + and B c (2 3  \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), is predicted to be between 39% and 59% [8,13]. The low-energy photon in the B * c (2S) + decay chain is not reconstructed. The B * c (2S) + state",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector (TT) located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware stage, events are required to have at least one muon with high p T or a hadron with high transverse energy. At the software stage, two muon tracks or three charged tracks are required to have high p T and to form a secondary vertex with a significant displacement from the interaction point.",

The track reconstruction efficiency is studied in a data control sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays using a tag-and-probe technique [38], in which one of the muons is fully reconstructed as the tag track, and the other muon, the probe track, is reconstructed using only information from the TT detector and the muon stations. The track reconstruction efficiency is the fraction of J/\u03c8 candidates whose probe tracks match fully reconstructed tracks. The particle-identification (PID) efficiency of the two opposite-charge pions is determined with a data-driven method, using a \u03c0 + sample from D * -tagged D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays. The total efficiency \u03b5 B + c is determined to be 0.0931 \u00b1 0.0005, where the uncertainty is the statistical uncertainty of the simulated sample.

The sources of systematic uncertainties that affect the upper limit calculation are studied and summarised in table 2. The systematic uncertainty on N B + c comes from the potentially imperfect modelling of the signal, and has been studied using pseudoexperiments. The uncertainty on \u03b5 B + c is due to the limited size of the simulated sample. The uncertainty on N B comes both from differences between the combinatorial backgrounds in the opposite-sign and the same-sign data samples and from the potential mismodelling of the background. The former is studied by performing a large set of pseudoexperiments, in which the samples are generated by randomly taking candidates from the data sample, while the candidates in M (B + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2208 [6785, 6900] MeV/c 2 are taken from the same-sign sample. The M (B + c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distributions of the pseudosamples are fit using the same function as in the nominal background modelling. The difference between the mean value of N B obtained from the pseudoexperiments and the nominal value is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The potential mismodelling of the background is estimated by using the Bukin function [39] as an alternative model and the differences to the nominal results are taken as systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties on \u03b5 B     between 0.02 and 0.14. Theoretical models predict that the ratio R has no significant dependence on y and p T of the B + c mesons [19], allowing comparison with the ATLAS result [18]. The most probable interpretation of the ATLAS measurement is that it is either the B * c (2S) + state or a sum of B c (2S) + and B * c (2S) + signals under the \u2206M \u223c 0 scenario. For both interpretations of the ATLAS measurement, the comparison of the ratio R between the LHCb upper limits in the vicinity of the peak claimed by ATLAS at M (B  ",
