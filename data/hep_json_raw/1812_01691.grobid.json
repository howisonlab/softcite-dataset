The data were collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC in the laboratory pseudorapidity range \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2. Asymmetric beam energies of 4 TeV for protons and 1.58 TeV per nucleon for Pb nuclei were used, corresponding to a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. Collisions with either the proton (p+Pb) or the ion (Pb+p) traveling towards the negative \u03b7 hemisphere are studied. The jet cross sections are unfolded to stable-particle level cross sections with p T 3 GeV, and compared to predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators. In addition, the cross section ratio of p+Pb and Pb+p data is presented. The results are discussed in terms of the saturation of gluon densities at low fractional parton momenta. None of the models under consideration describes all the data over the full jet-energy range and for all beam configurations. Discrepancies between the differential cross sections in data and model predictions of more than two orders of magnitude are observed.",

However, in the low-x kinematic regime considered in this paper, this approach is expected to fail, whereas the Balitsky-Fadin- Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equations [16][17][18], which evolve the parton densities as a function of 1/x, should be better suited to describe forward jet production. Both the DGLAP and BFKL equations are linear equations, i.e., they account for parton splitting and radiation, but not for parton recombination, processes. The BFKL and DGLAP equations predict a rapid rise of the gluon density towards small x, a result that has been experimentally confirmed by measurements at HERA [19]. This rise is mitigated when next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections are taken into consideration. Despite this, the growth of the gluon density with decreasing x ultimately will result in a violation of unitarity (i.e., the cross section for parton scatterings will exceed the total inelastic hadronic cross section), and the linear evolution equations alone will not be sufficient to describe forward jet data. To solve this, it has been hypothesized [3] that at sufficiently small values of x, nonlinear gluon recombination processes will slow-down the uncontrolled growth of the PDFs. Such a parton \"saturation\" regime, characterized by a virtuality scale known as the saturation scale Q s (x), is described by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equations [20,21]. Saturation effects are expected to become important in the kinematic region where the gluon density, xg(x, Q 2 ), times the transverse extent of the gluons, \u03b1 S (Q 2 )/Q 2 , becomes equal to the transverse area of the hadron \u03c0R 2 had [22]:",

Collisions in which either the proton (p+Pb) or the 208 Pb ion (Pb+p) travels towards the negative \u03b7 hemisphere (where CASTOR is located) are studied. Asymmetric beam energies of 4 TeV for the protons and 1.58 TeV per nucleon for the lead nuclei were used, yielding a proton-nucleon center-of-mass energy of \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. This implies that the center-of-mass system of the p+Pb collisions is shifted with respect to the laboratory frame, and the Pb+p center-of-mass system is boosted in the opposite direction. Therefore, the effective acceptance of CASTOR in the center-of-mass frame is different for the p+Pb and Pb+p beam setups. Jet cross sections, unfolded to the stable-particle level, and ratios of p+Pb to Pb+p cross sections are studied, and compared to the predictions from Monte Carlo (MC) event generators including, or not, parton saturation effects.",

A diagram of CASTOR is shown in figure 1. It consists of tungsten absorbers and quartz detection plates. The CASTOR calorimeter is segmented into 16 azimuthal sectors and each sector is longitudinally segmented into 14 modules. The first two modules comprise the electromagnetic section, which is approximately 20 radiation lengths deep. The remaining twelve modules constitute the hadronic section and are approximately nine nuclear interaction lengths deep. Thus, the overall depth of CASTOR is approximately ten nuclear interaction lengths. CASTOR is a non-compensating calorimeter with a relative response to incident pions with respect to electrons of approximately 50% at an energy of 100 GeV. The intrinsic relative jet-energy resolution of CASTOR is approximately 25 (10)% for fully contained jets (i.e., jets that do not suffer from transverse leakage) of 550 (2500) GeV. It should be noted though that CASTOR has no \u03b7 segmentation; this leads to substantial transverse leakage JHEP05(2019)043 Figure 1. A schematic drawing of one half of the CASTOR calorimeter and its mechanical support structure. The diameter of CASTOR is roughly 0.6 m and it is approximately 1.6 m in length. The transversal and longitudinal segmentation in eight sectors and fourteen modules, respectively, can be clearly distinguished. The 112 small cylinders represent the photomultiplier tubes of CASTOR. These are mounted on light guides, which transport the Cherenkov radiation out of the detector. It may be observed that CASTOR has only transverse and no \u03b7 segmentation.",

This model uses a combination of soft pomeron exchange (as in Regge-Gribov theory [42,43]) and a semihard contribution based on the convolution of a nonperturbative pre-evolution, a DGLAP-based hard evolution, and standard leading order QCD 2 \u2192 2 cross sections [44]. The semihard contribution has been tuned to HERA structure function data and is recast as a hard pomeron amplitude. Saturation is modeled through pomeron-pomeron interactions and is implemented by modifying the x dependence of the pomeron amplitudes. In ref. [45], however, it is shown that this leads to too strong a suppression of the hard component, a shortcoming that will be remedied in an upcoming version of the model. Similar to epos-lhc, the qgsjetii-04 model is based on the Regge-Gribov theory for the soft interactions and hard matrix elements convolved with DGLAP evolution for the hard scatterings. In this case, pomeron self-interactions result in saturation effects. The Cosmic Ray Monte Carlo CRMC package v1.5.6 [46] is used to generate the cross sections for the epos-lhc, hijing, and qgsjetii-04 models.",

Such an approach is considered to be valid in configurations with very asymmetric fractional momenta, resulting, for example, in forward jet production. The TMDs are obtained from the Kutak-Sapeta (KS) framework [51], combined with linear (BFKL) or nonlinear (BK) evolution with running coupling, respectively. The strength of the nonlinear term can be varied; here, a default strength of 75% is used, with a variation of \u00b125% to reflect the sensitivity to nonlinear evolution. The parton density used in the collinear framework is the CTEQ10 NLO set [52]. The katie program is used to calculate leading order hard scattering matrix elements for the 2 \u2192 1 process (g * q \u2192 q or g * g \u2192 g) with incoming offshell gluons. The subsequent hadronization is modeled using cascade v2.4.13 [53]. A more in-depth description of the predictions that are included in the present paper can be found in ref. [54].",

            "text": "The aamqs predictions [24] for the forward jet spectra are also obtained using hybrid factorization. At the parton level, the aamqs model generates quarks and gluons from gq \u2192 q and gg \u2192 g hard processes, along with initial-and final-state radiation based on DGLAP evolution. The TMD is related to a dipole scattering amplitude in coordinate space via a Fourier transform and, in this paper, an implementation based on the McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model [55][56][57] is used to derive the dipole scattering amplitude within the color glass condensate framework [20,21,[58][59][60][61][62][63]. In this framework the hard partons act as color sources for a classical non-Abelian background field, which is formed by numerous soft gluons. The aamqs calculations are performed at leading order in \u03b1 S . The evolution of the TMD is performed using the BK equation with running coupling strength. For the collinear PDFs the CTEQ6 LO set was used [64]. Multiple parton interactions are included JHEP05 (2019)043in the framework, and hadronization is performed using the Lund string fragmentation model [65], as implemented in pythia. To account for missing higher-order effects in the katie and aamqs models, the overall jet cross section normalization may be modified using a constant K-factor. This factor is fixed to unity for the predictions presented in this paper. Full next-to-leading order calculations [66] may lower the jet cross sections by approximately 40%.",

[68] that this selection effectively suppresses the contribution of photon-induced and diffractive events to a negligible level. To mitigate the effect of pileup in data, only events with at most one reconstructed primary vertex [69] are selected. After the event selection has been applied, the CASTOR jet spectrum is found to be independent of the instantaneous luminosity of the collisions, confirming that pileup does not impact the results of this analysis. Dedicated eventselection filters are applied to remove beam-gas scattering events and interactions of the beam with the beam pipe. By studying the occurrence of events satisfying the online and offline criteria in a zero bias event sample, in which only the presence of beams within the CMS detector is required, the trigger is found to be fully efficient for events that fulfill the offline selection criteria.",

These energy-dependent calibration functions are obtained from simulation as follows. First, a particle-level jet is matched to a detector-level jet. Subsequently, it is required that the particle-level jet is isolated (i.e., that there is no other particle-level jet contributing to the detector-level jet) and contained (i.e., the jet is incident in the region \u22126.1 < \u03b7 < \u22125.7).

For the Pb+p data and simulations, the energy spectrum extends well beyond the incoming energy per nucleon of 1.58 TeV, because the jet algorithm picks up energy deposits originating from the ion remnants, for which the spectra are not corrected. The detector-level distributions indicate that hijing yields the best overall description of the data, although the description of the beam remnants can certainly be further improved. The epos-lhc and qgsjetii-04 models underestimate the measurements, in particular in the high-energy part of the p+Pb spectrum. The ratio of energy spectra of p+Pb to Pb+p data is shown in figure 3.",

To perform the unfolding, jets at the detector and stable-particle levels are matched in \u03c6 to create a response matrix. Because of the lack of \u03b7 resolution of CASTOR, it is not possible to match jet pairs in the distance R between the detector-and particle-level jets. The procedure also corrects for stable-particle level jets not found at detector-level (missed jets) and for fake jets. It is found that 100 (p+Pb) and 720 (Pb+p) Bayesian iterations are needed to obtain a stable result. The relatively large number of iterations can be explained by the broadness of the response matrices. Two main effects are responsible for this broadness. One is the intrinsic energy resolution of CASTOR. The other is the lack of \u03b7 segmentation, which causes large transversal leakage. This leads to a further broadening of the response matrix. This is outlined in more detail in ref. [74]. In the unfolding procedure all jets with energy above 150 GeV are taken into account. However, in order to avoid large model-dependent correction factors arising from migrations of jets over the 150 GeV cutoff, the unfolded jet energy spectra are presented in section 6 starting from an energy threshold of 550 GeV, corresponding to a transverse momentum of p T = E/ cosh(\u03b7) \u2248 3 GeV. From this cutoff onwards the fraction of missed and fake jets is smaller than 10 and 5%, respectively. The unfolding procedure and its validation are discussed in ref. [74]. Finally, the cross section ratio of p+Pb to Pb+p is obtained from the individually unfolded spectra.",

The ratio of the cross sections in p+Pb to Pb+p data is shown in figure 5 (right). The latter distribution would be in principle expected to be directly sensitive to parton saturation effects, independently of any particular data-model comparison. Indeed, whereas jets in the p+Pb data probe the ion parton density at low values of x and are therefore sensitive to possible enhanced saturation effects in nuclei, the Pb+p cross section would be sensitive to the low-x content of the proton, which is expected to be less affected by saturation. In principle, strong parton saturation effects would lead to depletion of the cross section ratio towards low jet energy. However, because the \u03b7 selection is made in the laboratory frame (\u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2), and not in the center-of-mass frame, different center-of-mass \u03b7 ranges are being compared (the Lorentz-boost between the p+Pb and Pb+p center-of-mass frames results in an \u03b7 shift of \u2206\u03b7 = 0.87). The ratio of spectra in figure 5 (right) is thus sensitive to proton and lead parton distributions evaluated at different x, thereby complicating the interpretation of the data.
