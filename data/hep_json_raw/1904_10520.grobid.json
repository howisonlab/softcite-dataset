The measured B \u039b differs from the widely used value 4, 5 and from predictions in which the hypertriton is modeled as a \u039b weakly bound to a deuterium nucleus 6-9 . Our results place stringent constraints on the hyperon-nucleon interaction 10, 11 , and provide critical inputs for studying neutron star interiors, where strange matter may be present 12 . The same data also permit more precise comparison between the masses of the hypertriton and the antihypertriton. Matter-antimatter symmetry 13 pertaining to the binding of strange and antistrange quarks (s ands) in a nucleus is thus tested quantitatively for the first time. No deviation from the expected exact symmetry is observed.",

            "text": "The CPT theorem [14][15][16][17] holds that all processes must exactly conserve the combined operation of C (charge conjugation, which interchanges a particle with its antiparticle), P (parity, which reverses the direction of all spatial axes), and T (time reversal). One implication is that every particle should have a mass and lifetime identical to those of its antiparticle, but opposite electric charge and magnetic moment 13 . No CPT violation has ever been observed 13,18,19 . Qualitatively different tests of CPT symmetry are a continuing priority for fundamental physics, as are revisitations of past tests with improved accuracy. While CPT invariance has been verified to a precision of 10 \u221219 in the strange quark sector for kaons 18 , we present here the first test of CPT in a nucleus having strangeness content.",

            "text": "Hypernuclei are natural hyperon-baryon correlation systems, and thus provide direct access to the hyperon-nucleon (Y N) interaction through measurements of the binding energy B \u039b in a hypernucleus 20, 21  . However, in a half-century of research, the creation of the hypertriton and precise measurements of its properties have proven difficult in contrast to the study of heavier hypernuclei that are produced via the traditional method of a kaon beam incident on a nuclear target 22 . Early measurements of the hypertriton B \u039b are consistent with zero and span a wide range characterised by a full width at half maximum of 2.1 MeV 4, 5, 23 . Modern facilities now permit an improved understanding of the Y N interaction via more precise measurements of hyperon binding in hypernuclei, such as the lifetime measurement for the hypertriton 24 . Progress in understanding the Y N interaction and the equation of state of hypernuclear matter has astrophysical implications in the understanding of neutron star properties. Inclusion of hyperons in the cores of neutron stars softens the equation of state, and thus reduces the stellar masses 12,22,25 . In model calculations, the maximum mass of the neutron star can vary from 0.4 to 2.4 of solar masses, depending on the strength of the \u039bNN three-body repulsive potential which is directly related to the \u039b binding energy in hypernuclei 25,26 .",

In this phase, called the quark-gluon plasma 27 (QGP), quarks are free to move throughout the volume of the nuclear collision region. The QGP exhibits fluid properties with an exceptionally low ratio of viscosity to entropy density 28 , and a far higher vorticity than any other system produced in a laboratory or observed in nature 29 . The QGP persists for only a few times 10 \u221223 seconds, then cools and transitions into a lower temperature phase comprised of mesons, baryons and antibaryons, including the occasional antinucleus or antihypernucleus 9, 11 . Thus these collisions offer an ideal laboratory to explore fundamental physics involving nuclei, hypernuclei, and their antimatter partners.",

The TPC is immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.5 T parallel to the beam direction, and is used in conjunction with the HFT for charged particle tracking in three dimensions.

We obtain B \u039b = 0.41 \u00b1 0.12(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.) MeV This binding energy is presented in Fig. 4 (left panel) along with earlier measurements 4, 31-33 from nuclear emulsion and helium bubble chamber experiments. The current STAR result differs from zero with a significance of 2.6\u03c3. The masses used for \u039b, \u03c0 \u2212 , p, d and 3 He in the early measurements of B \u039b were different from contemporary standard CODATA 30 and PDG 18 values. Thus the early B \u039b values have been recalculated using the most precise mass values known today, and the recalibrated results are shown by short horizontal magenta lines in Fig. 4 (left panel; see Methods section for details). Even after recalibration, the central value of the current STAR measurement is larger than the measurement from 1973 4 which is widely used. It has been pointed out in Ref. 23 that for measurements of B \u039b for p-shell hypernuclei, there exists a discrepancy in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 MeV between emulsion data and other modern measurements. Whether the effect would be similar in s-shell hypernuclei such as the hypertriton is unclear, but such a discrepancy is much larger than the systematic uncertainty assigned to emulsion measurements 34 . Until this discrepancy is well understood, an average of the current measurement with early results can not be reliably carried out. In addition to measurements, theoretical calculations of B \u039b for 3 \u039b H are also available (see right panel of Fig. 4). For example, Dalitz calculated B \u039b = 0.10 MeV in 1972 35 , while B \u039b values in the range 0.01-0.37 MeV were obtained through an ab initio calculation in 2002 36 . More recent theoretical calculations have yielded larger B \u039b values. In 2008, B \u039b = 0.262 MeV was obtained through SU(6) quark model baryon-baryon interactions 37 , and B \u039b was found to be 0.23 MeV using auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) in 2018 38 . The dispersion of the results from the different calculations emphasizes the need for a precise determination of B \u039b from experiments. In a related matter, the latest compilation of measurements yields a 3 \u039b H lifetime (30 \u00b1 8)% shorter than the free \u039b lifetime 39 . A calculation in which the closure approximation was introduced to evaluate the wavefunctions by solving the three-body Faddeev equations, also indicates that the 3 \u039b H lifetime is (19 \u00b1 2)% smaller than that of \u039b 39 . The larger B \u039b value and shorter lifetime suggest a stronger Y N interaction between the \u039b and the nuclear core in 3 \u039b H, which may require a re-evaluation of the inference that the 3 \u039b H can be regarded as a simple weakly-bound \u039b-deuteron system. In summary, we report the first test of CPT invariance in the sector of hypernuclear matter where (anti)strange quarks play a role in (anti)nuclear binding. The relative mass difference between the hypertriton and antihypertriton is [ 1.1 \u00b1 1.0(stat.) \u00b1 0.5(syst.)] \u00d7 10 \u22124 , consistent with no violation of CPT symmetry. Prior comparisons of nuclear binding for nuclei and antinuclei involved only up and down quarks, and this measurement both includes a strange quark and improves the uncertainty for mass number A = 3 by roughly an order of magnitude. We also report a new measurement of the \u039b hyperon binding energy in the hypertriton: B \u039b = 0.41 \u00b1 0.12(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.) MeV. The value differs from zero with a significance of 2.6\u03c3, and is larger than the prior measurement from 1973 4 which is widely used. Models in which the hypertriton is treated as a weakly-bound \u039b-deuteron system predict smaller B \u039b values. These results constrain the hyperon-nucleon interaction, providing improved data to understand the role of hyperons in neutron stars, and thus have wide-ranging implications spanning nuclear physics, particle physics, and astrophysics.",

In the studies being updated here, Q (Q ) was determined from the length of decay daughter tracks, based on the range versus energy relationship for that charged particle species in nuclear emulsion or in a He bubble chamber. The published B \u039b values were calculated using the contemporaneous mass values for \u039b, \u03c0 \u2212 , p, d, 3 He, as reproduced in Table 1, which can be seen to differ from the best current numbers. Q 0 (Q 0 ) has been recalculated using current numbers and the B \u039b values for past emulsion and bubble chamber studies are thus recalibrated in this letter.  41 1875.50 40,45,46 2808.22 40,45,46 Bohm et al.
