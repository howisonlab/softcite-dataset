The results of the electron and muon channels are combined, and we measure the total production cross section and the differential cross section d\u03c3/dp \u03b3 T , where p \u03b3 T is the momentum of the photon in the plane transverse to the beamline. The results obtained are consistent with the standard model predictions from next-to-leading order calculations. We use the transverse momentum spectrum of the photon to place limits on anomalous ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings.",

The tracking system, consisting of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) and a scintillating fiber tracker (CFT), provides coverage for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| 3 [14]. The CPS is located immediately before the inner layer of the calorimeter and has about one radiation length of absorber followed by several layers of scintillating strips. The calorimeter consists of a central cryostat sector (CC) with coverage |\u03b7| 1.1 and two end calorimeters (EC) which extend coverage to |\u03b7| \u2248 4.2. The electromagnetic (EM) section of the calorimeter is segmented into four longitudinal layers (EMi, i = 1, 4) with transverse segmentation of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.1 \u00d7 0.1, except in EM3, where it is 0.05 \u00d7 0.05.

The pp interaction vertex must be reconstructed within \u00b160 cm of the center of the D0 detector along the beam (z) axis. For the electron channel, a sample of candidate Z-boson events is collected with a suite of single-electron triggers. The electrons are selected by requiring an EM cluster in either the CC (|\u03b7| < 1.1) or EC (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.5) regions of the EM calorimeter with transverse momentum p T > 25 (15) GeV/c for the electron candidate with the highest (next-to-highest) transverse energy contained within a cone of radius \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.2, centered on the axis of the EM shower. At least 90% of the cluster energy must be deposited within the EM section of the calorimeter. Electron candidates, with a shower shape consistent with that of an electron, are required to be spatially matched to a track and to be isolated in both the calorimeter and tracking detectors. To suppress jets and photons misidentified as electrons, a likelihood discriminant is built using a set of variables sensitive to differences in tracker activity and energy deposits in the calorimeter: the number of tracks and the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of all tracks within \u2206R < 0.4 of the EM cluster, the fraction of energy deposited in the EM section of the calorimeter, the longi-tudinal and transverse shower profile in the calorimeter, the ratio between the transverse energy in the calorimeter and the transverse momentum of the electron associated track. To further suppress jets misidentified as electrons, in particular for high instantaneous luminosity conditions, a neural network algorithm is trained on Drell-Yan Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 and jet data, using information from the calorimeter and CPS: the numbers of cells above a threshold in EM1 within \u2206R < 0.2 and 0.2 < \u2206R < 0.4 of the EM cluster, the number of CPS clusters within \u2206R < 0.1 of the EM cluster, and the squared-energy weighted width of the energy deposit in the CPS. Events where both electrons are contained within the EC are excluded because of the small signal acceptance. Candidate events where the Z boson decays into two muons are collected using a suite of single-muon triggers. Within the muon channel, muon candidates are required to be within |\u03b7| < 2 and matched to a well-isolated track in both the tracker and the calorimeter with transverse momentum p T > 15 GeV/c.

            "text": "Here, N data and N data \u03b3 are the number of measured Z and background-subtracted Z\u03b3 events in data sample, respectively. The factor (\u03c3 Z \u00d7 B) NNLO FEWZ is calculated with the fewz next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) generator [17]- [18], with the CTEQ6.6 parton distribution functions (PDF) [19]. The fewz theoretical prediction is 262.9 \u00b1 8.0 pb, where the dominant uncertainty is from the choice of PDF. The term B is the branching fraction for Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 , which in the SM is 3.4% for either electrons or muons. The factor \u03ba corrects for the resolution effects that would cause events not to pass the selections on the generator-level quantities, e.g. a generator-level photon with p \u03b3 T < 10 GeV/c, but to pass the reconstruction requirements, e.g. a reconstructed photon with p \u03b3 T > 10 GeV/c. This factor is only used for Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 events, and corrects for the photon energy smearing that dominates in the first p \u03b3 T bin. The muon p T resolution affects both Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 and Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 and the corresponding correction cancel in the ratio of cross sections. For the events that pass the generator-level requirements, the factors (A \u00d7 ID ) \u03b3 and (A \u00d7 ID ) provide the fraction of events that pass the analysis requirements, with all acceptances measured relative to the kinematic requirements at the generator level for the and \u03b3 final states, respectively. Events migrate between bins in p \u03b3 T because of finite detector resolution, and these effects are taken into account in calculating (A \u00d7 ID ) \u03b3 as a function of p \u03b3 T , while (A \u00d7 ID ) is calculated for the entire sample. To estimate \u03ba and A \u00d7 ID , we use inclusive Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 events generated with the pythia [20] generator with final-state radiation simulated using photos [21] and the CTEQ6.1L [22] PDF set. Because pythia is a leading-order (LO) generator and does not reproduce the observed p Z T spectrum in data, generated events are weighted to reflect the p Z T distribution observed in Ref. [23]. Events are then traced through the D0 detector using a simulation based on geant [24]. Data events from random beam crossings are overlaid on the simulated interactions to reproduce the effects of multiple pp interactions and detector noise. Simulated interactions are reweighted that take into account the observed differences between data and simulation, e.g., z coordinate of the vertex, instantaneous luminosity, trigger efficiency, lepton identification (ID) efficiency, photon ID efficiency, and resolution effects. Here, the factor (A \u00d7 ID ) has values of 0.15 (0.17) in the electron channel (muon channel). When no constraints on M \u03b3 are applied, the factor \u03ba has average values of 0.83 \u00b1 0.01 (stat.) and 0.85 \u00b1 0.01 (stat.) for the electron and muon channels, respectively, and the average value of (A \u00d7 ID ) \u03b3 is 0.12 for both the electron and muon channels. Values for (A \u00d7 ID ) \u03b3 and \u03ba are similar for the subsample requiring M \u03b3 > 110 GeV/c 2 .",

We find that the effect introduces a 1.5% systematic uncertainty on the total cross section. The dominant uncertainty corresponding to the calculation of A \u00d7 ID is due to choice of the PDF set. There are 20 free parameters in the CTEQ6.1L parametrization of the PDF that reflect fits to data from previous experiments. The uncertainties on acceptance and efficiencies due to the PDF parametrization are estimated using the CTEQ6.1M PDF uncertainties, following Ref. [25]. We find a total PDF uncertainty of 3.5%, dominated by the uncertainty on the acceptance-correction to the full geometrical lepton acceptance. The photon ID efficiency is determined from a simulated sample of photons and is estimated to have an uncertainty of 10% for p \u03b3 T < 15 GeV/c and 3% for p \u03b3 T > 15 GeV/c. To reduce the contribution of FSR in the data samples, we calculate the cross section with and without the M \u03b3 > 110 GeV/c 2 requirement. To combine the electron and muon channels, we utilize the BLUE method [26], which averages the results of measurements with correlated systematic uncertainties. We assume the PDF and photon ID efficiency uncertainties to be 100% correlated between the two channels. The total cross section results can be found in Tables I and II. The measurements are consistent with the NLO mcfm [27] prediction using CTEQ6.6 PDF set [19] and the renormalization and factorization scales evaluated at the mass of the W boson, M W = 80 GeV/c 2 . The PDF uncertainties associated with the SM prediction are evaluated following Ref. [25]. We reevaluate the values for the p \u03b3 T spectrum calculated by NLO mcfm with the renormalization and factorization scales set to 160 GeV/c 2 and again at 40 GeV/c 2 and use these as estimates of the theoretical uncertainty of one standard deviation relative to the central NLO mcfm value.

            "text": "To set limits on anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings, we generate Z\u03b3 events for different values of the anomalous couplings using the NLO Monte Carlo generator of Ref. [2]. SM Drell-Yan production is included by reweighting the p \u03b3 T spectrum to mcfm for vanishing anomalous couplings. As shown in Fig. 5, anomalous Z\u03b3 couplings would contribute to an excess of high en- ergy photons as compared to the SM prediction. We apply the following generator-level requirements: M > 60 GeV/c 2 , \u2206R \u03b3 > 0.7, p \u03b3 T > 10 GeV/c, |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1, and M \u03b3 >110 GeV/c 2 , generate p \u03b3 T templates as a function of the anomalous couplings, and use the known acceptance and resolution functions to fold the predicted generator-level distribution into a reconstructionlevel distribution for p \u03b3 T . Using Poisson statistics for p \u03b3 T > 30 GeV/c, we define a likelihood function to compare the combined electron and muon channels with a predicted distribution for given values of anomalous couplings. In the absence of any significant deviation from the SM prediction, we set one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) limits on the anomalous coupling parameter values at the 95% C.L. A combined log-likelihood function using all data is defined by the sum of the individual log-likelihood functions of the electron and muon channels. We include the effect of systematic uncertainties associated with transforming a Monte Carlo p \u03b3 T template from the generator-level into a reconstructed distribution and find that these uncertainties contribute to the value of the calculated limits on the order of 1%. We generate a 10 \u00d7 10 grid of templates for the p \u03b3 T distribution as a function of h V 03 and h V 04 for |h V 03 | < 0.1 and |h V 04 | < 0.01, while setting all other coupling parameters to zero, and the limits are derived by varying about the maxima of the log-likelihood functions for the 95% C.L [30]. Results for the 1D limits for \u039b = 1.2 TeV and 1.5 TeV are shown in Table V. The 1D and 2D limits on the anomalous couplings parameters are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, utilizing the electron and muon channels.    In these figures, the dotted lines represent the theoretical limits on the anomalous coupling values, beyond which S-matrix unitarity is violated. Because the h V 04 parameters come from dimension-eight operators, the limits are more constrained than those of h V 03 couplings, which are dimension-six.",

Both the total production cross sections and differential cross sections d\u03c3/dp \u03b3 T are consistent with the SM at NLO predicted by mcfm [27]. We observe no deviation from SM predictions and place 1D and 2D limits on the CP -even anomalous Z\u03b3 couplings for \u039b = 1.2 and 1.5 TeV. When combining with the previous D0 analyses, the limits are comparable to those found in the most recent CDF result [8], which uses \u2248 5 fb \u22121 in the \u03b3 and \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 channels and \u039b = 1.5 TeV. Our results include the first unfolded photon differential cross section d\u03c3/dp \u03b3 T , as well as the most precise measurement of the total production cross section of Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3.
