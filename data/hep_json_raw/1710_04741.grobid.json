We show that the center-of-mass energy dependences of the charged-particle production sensitive to the underlying event (\"transverse\" region) and to the hardest partonic interaction (\"towards\" and \"away\" regions) in pp collisions can be both understood in terms of the change of the inclusive average multiplicity. Within uncertainties, the corresponding particle production as a function of the leading charged particle shows no significant \u221a sdependence for the three regions once they are scaled according to the relative change in multiplicity. The scaling properties reported here are well reproduced by PYTHIA 8.212 tune Monash 2013 and suggest an universality of the underlying event in hadronic interactions at high \u221a s. Based on the simulations, we observed that the same scaling properties are also present in the average number of multi-partonic interactions as a function of the leading charged particle. Moreover, the multiplicity distributions associated to the underlying event exhibit a KNO scaling.",

For instance, considering minimum bias proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, most of the partonic interactions at mid-rapidity are among gluons with x \u2248 2p T / \u221a s \u2248 10 \u22123 [1]. An accurate description of these processes is essential for simulating single pp interactions as well as the pile up effects that become important in high intensity runs at hadron colliders.",

The number density and the summed p T were both scaled considering the factors f = 1, 1.842 and 2.191 for pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9, 7 and 13 TeV, respectively. Figure 3 shows the number densities (top panel) and the summed p T (bottom panel) for the three regions considered after scaling by 1/f factor. In this representation these quantities show, within uncertainties, little center-of-mass energy dependence. For the towards and the away regions, we observe that the multiplicity density increases monotonically with the p leading T scale. While in the transverse region, after a monotonic increase at low p leading T (< 5 GeV/c), the distribution tends to",

            "text": "energy dependence of such quantities as a function of the hard transverse momentum scale can be explained as a consequence of the change in the average multiplicity density of primary charged particles. The study was conducted considering charged particles with p T > 0.5 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Such a scaling property was observed for three regions sensitive to different processes: towards and away (sensitive to the fragmentation products of the hardest partonic interaction), and transverse (the most sensitive to the underlying event activity) regions. Since the scaling is reproduced by PYTHIA 8.212, we performed an analysis and found that the same scaling is unveiled if one considers the average number of multi-partonic interactions instead of charged particles multiplicity or summed p T . Indeed, for p leading T \u2265 10 GeV/c the relative change in the number of multi-partonic interactions (going from \u221a s = 0.9 TeV to higher energies) agrees (within 10%) with the relative change in the average multiplicity calculated using charged particles within |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c. In addition, we found that multiplicity distributions in the underlying-event region exhibit a KNO scaling which is expected for a single pp collision involving a large number multi-partonic interactions emitting independently. The results support the existence of MPI and allows us to learn about the geometry in pp collisions. Therefore, the results presented here may serve as a useful input to understand the new data provided by the LHC experiments, in particular the new phenomena discovered in high multiplicity pp collisions.",
