The results are based on different techniques, such as the identification of semileptonic b-decays into muons and inclusive jet measurements with secondary vertex tagging. The measurements probe b-quark production in different regions of transverse momenta. The experimental results are compared with next-to-leading order QCD predictions and various Monte Carlo models.",

Firstly, in order to test QCD predictions which have been computed at next-to-leading order (NLO) precision but are still characterized by large scale dependence. Secondly, because b-jets represent an important source of background for many of the most interesting physics searches, as the Higgs boson and Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. Most recent measurements performed at Tevatron [1,2,3,4], HERA [5,6,7,8] and LEP [9] are in reasonable agreement with QCD predictions in most regions of the phase space.",

The results are obtained with data collected in March-July 2010. A first measurement is based on the identification of semileptonic decays of b quarks into muons and jets. Muons from b-and c-quark decays can be distinguished using the transverse momentum relative to the jet, which is on average larger for b-events than in c-decays and for muons from light hadrons. This measurement probes the production process at low transverse momenta. A second measurement is based on the reconstruction of the secondary vertex in jets from the B-hadron decays, exploiting the high spatial resolution of the silicon pixel tracker. This measurement extends to large b-quark transverse momenta. Both results are compared to NLO QCD predictions and various Monte Carlo (MC) models.",

Theoretical predictions for the cross section measurement were obtained with PYTHIA 6.4 [12], HERWIG 6.5 [13], MC@NLO 3.4 [14], FONLL [15] and POWHEG [16]. The CTEQ6L1 and CTEQ6M parton densities [17] were used for PYTHIA and MC@NLO predictions, respectively.

The b-tagged sample purity was also estimated from data, using template fits to the secondary vertex mass distribution, and the results were found to be in good agreement with MC expectations, well within the 3% statistical uncertainty. This constrains the charm mistag rate to within 20% of the MC expectation. The correction factor C unfolds the measured p T back to particle level using the ansatz method [23].",

We find an overall good agreement between data and Pythia in the jet transverse momentum range 30 < p T < 150 GeV and rapidity |y| < 2.0, within about 2% statistical uncertainty and 21% systematic uncertainty. We also observe a reasonable agreement between the MC@NLO calculation and the measured overall b-jet fraction, within the 21% systematic uncertainty, but observe significant shape differences in p T and y. The inclusive b-jet prediction is calculated with MC@NLO, using the CTEQ6M PDF set and the b-quark mass of 4.75 GeV. The results are compared to a NLO theory prediction (MC@NLO) and to the Pythia MC, and are found to be in good agreement with Pythia and in reasonable agreement with MC@NLO.

The measurements utilize different techniques and cover a wide range of b-quark transverse momenta. The results were compared to NLO QCD predictions and various Monte Carlo models. The cross section measured with semileptonic decays into muons is above NLO QCD predictions at low momenta and central pseudorapidities. The b-jet cross section measured with secondary vertex tagging for p T > 18 GeV is in reasonable agreement with NLO QCD but exhibits shape differences at large rapidities. It is foreseen to extend the measured kinematic range by analyzing the larger data samples collected in the 2010 LHC run.",
