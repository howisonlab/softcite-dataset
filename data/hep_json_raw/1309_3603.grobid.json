CP-violating weak phase \u03c6 s and \u2206\u0393 s from flavortagged time-dependent angular analysis of B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 by ATLAS New phenomena beyond the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) may alter CP violation in B-decays. A channel that is expected to be sensitive to new physics contributions is the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 (quark content B 0 s \u2261 bs [1]). CP violation in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 decay occurs due to interference between direct decays and decays occurring through B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing. The oscillation frequency of B 0 s meson mixing is characterized by the mass difference \u2206m s of the heavy (B H ) and light (B L ) mass eigenstates. The CP-violating phase \u03c6 s is defined as the weak phase difference between the B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing amplitude and the b \u2192 ccs decay amplitude. In the SM the phase \u03c6 s is small and can be related to CKM quark mixing matrix elements; a value of \u03c6 s \u22122\u03b2 s = \u22120.0368 \u00b1 0.0018 rad is predicted in the SM [2]. Many models describing a new physics predict larger \u03c6 s values whilst satisfying all existing constraints, Email address: Igor.Gorelov@cern.ch (Igor V. Gorelov) 1 This talk is presented on behalf of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, CERN. including the precisely measured value of \u2206m s [3,4]. Another physical quantity involved in B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing is the width difference \u2206\u0393 s = \u0393 L \u2212 \u0393 H of B L and B H . Physics beyond the SM is not expected to affect \u2206\u0393 s as significantly as \u03c6 s [5]. The decay of the pseudoscalar B 0 s to the vector-vector final-state J/\u03c8\u03c6 results in an admixture of CP-odd and CP-even states, with orbital angular momentum L = 0, 1 or 2. The CP states are separated statistically through the time-dependence of the decay and angular correlations among the final-state particles.",

This decay is forbidden at tree level in the SM, resulting in small SM rates. From the theoretical side, robust calculations are now possible for much of the phase space of this decay and the calculations also indicate that new physics could give rise to readily observable effects. Finally, this decay mode is relatively easy to select and reconstruct at hadron colliders. Two important observables in the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 (892)(\u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay are the forwardbackward asymmetry of the muons, A FB , and the longitudinal polarization fraction of the K * 0 (892), F L . The relevant angular variables are the angle \u03b8 l defined as the angle between the positive (negative) muon momentum and the direction opposite to the B 0 (B 0 ) in the dimuon reference frame and the angle \u03b8 K defined as the angle between the kaon momentum and the direction opposite to the B 0 (B 0 ) in the K * 0 (K * 0 ) rest frame. The decay rate distribution of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is described as a function of \u03b8 l and \u03b8 K and is measured in several q 2 (\u2261 m 2 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )) bins. The main results of the analysis, F L and A FB are extracted from unbinned extended maximum likelihood fits to three variables: m(B 0 ) and the two angular variables. The results yielded by fits for every q 2 bin are compared to SM predictions [9]. Deviations from the SM predictions may indicate new phenomena.",

The data for this analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity L dt \u2248 2.4 fb \u22121 collected at \u221a s = 7 TeV by a dimuon trigger, which requires the presence of at least two muon candidates of p T (\u00b5 \u00b1 ) > 4.0 GeV/c and |\u03b7(\u00b5 \u00b1 )| < 2.4 each. Offline, the events are required to contain at least one pair of reconstructed muons, and each pair is fitted using a vertexing algorithm. The corresponding J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidate with fitted common vertex is selected with the invariant mass, m(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) \u2208 (2.7, 3.5) GeV/c 2 . The muon tracks of the selected J/\u03c8 are again fitted to a common vertex with an additional hadron track of p T (h) > 1 GeV/c and with the K \u00b1 mass assigned. The three-track vertex fit is performed by constraining the muon tracks to the J/\u03c8 world average mass [1]. The B + candidates with p T (B + ) > 9 GeV/c and |y(B + )| < 2.3 in the mass range m(B + ) \u2208 (5.040, 5.800) GeV/c 2 are kept for further analysis. The number of reconstructed B + mesons is obtained using a binned maximum likelihood fit to the invariant mass of the selected candidates per every (\u2206p T , \u2206y) bin. The cross section d 2 \u03c3(pp \u2192 B + + X)/d p T dy for four \u2206y and eight \u2206p T intervals, covering the range of |y| < 2.25 and p T \u2208 (9, 120) GeV/c are presented in Fig. 4 [15]. The measured differential cross section is compared with the QCD NLO calculations. The predictions are obtained using Powheg+Pythia and MC@NLO+Herwig and are quoted with an uncertainty from renormalization and factorization scales and bquark mass of the order of (20 \u2212 40)%. Within these uncertainties, Powheg+Pythia predictions are in agreement both in absolute scale and in the shape with the measured p T and y double differential distributions. At low |y|, MC@NLO+Herwig predicts lower production cross section and a softer p T spectrum than the one observed in data, which becomes harder for |y| > 1.0. An FONLL calculation with f b \u2192 B + = (40.1\u00b11.3)% to fix the overall scale, is in a good agreement with the measured spectra, in particular at p T < 30 GeV/c range.  Figure 4: Double-differential cross section of B + production as a function of p T for different rapidity ranges: (left plot) The data points are compared to NLO predictions from Powheg and MC@NLO; (right plot) the data points are compared with FONLL predictions (see also inset) and the CMS results as well.",
