At the HLT, the sequence of algorithms for b-jet triggers consists of two major steps: the calorimeter jet reconstruction and the bjet identification. This is a major difference compared to the b-jet trigger configuration in 2010 which was exclusively relying on tracking information at the HLT [3] (b-jet triggers were not actively selecting events in 2010 due to the relatively low LHC instantaneous luminosity). Each step includes a set of reconstruction algorithms ending with an hypothesis algorithm to stop the trigger execution as soon as it is clear that it doesn't fulfill the trigger requirement anymore. Three main features must be evaluated to perform the b-jet selection: reconstruct tracks of charged particles, measure the primary interaction vertex and estimate the b-tagging discriminant variables.

            "text": "The b-jet trigger rejection is evident from figure 7 where the rate at the output of the three trigger levels is shown for a particular b-jet trigger in a run with peak instantaneous luminosity of 2\u00d710 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . This particular trigger was designed for the all-hadronic tt final state. Other b-jet triggers were implemented and running online for benchmark channels such as H \u2192 bb, especially useful for the low Higgs mass region still to be fully explored, and for supersymmetric models with no leptons in the final state. The combination of the online plus offline b-tagging efficiency and mis-tag rate is a key ingredient to fully integrate b-jet triggers into physics analyses. Since detailed tracking information is not perfectly reproduced by the simulation, these measurements are currently being derived with data-driven techniques and are carried out using analyses already employed in ATLAS for the offline b-tagging [6]. These methods mainly explore muon properties from heavy-flavour decays or explicit reconstruction of B hadron decay chains. To successfully apply these methods a set of dedicated triggers collected muons close to jets in 2011, obtaining a sample enriched in B hadrons with a muon in the decay chain. Triggers with different jet thresholds were used to obtain a rather flat jet transverse momentum spectrum, as clearly shown in figure 8. In the second part of 2011, an additional trigger was deployed online to enable the b-jet efficiency measurement using techniques based on the reconstruction of the top quark.",
