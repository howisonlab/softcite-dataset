From the Lagrangians in Eqs. (1) and (3) we can infer that the higher the value of , the lower the production cross section of the heavy composite Majorana neutrino. Since N is its own antiparticle, it can be produced either as a neutrino or an antineutrino. In pp collisions it can be produced in association with a lepton through quark-antiquark annihilation (qq \u2192 + N ). This process can occur via both gauge and contact interactions. The latter is dominant for a wide range of values, including the ones to which we are sensitive in this search. Fig. 2 (top) shows the leading order (LO) production cross section, as a function of the N mass, for the case = 9 TeV, which is one of the values considered in this Letter whose calculation is based on Ref.

These previous searches have been performed in the qq ( = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) channels, considering two leptons and two spatially separated jets. However, in our case, this selection has limited acceptance for gauge boson mediated decays, for which the two jets are expected to overlap, as they originate from highly Lorentz-boosted hadronic W boson decay products. We overcome this constraint by selecting events with at least one jet with angular radius large enough to contain a merged pair of partons. Such a requirement is also highly efficient for heavy composite Majorana neutrino decays mediated by the contact interaction, where we select only one of the two decay jets, as described later in this paper. This final selection, considered for the first time in a search for heavy neutrinos, could improve the sensitivity of searches for heavy neutrinos in the framework of other models, such as the one considered in Refs. [19,20].",

The finely segmented ECAL consists of nearly 76 000 lead-tungstate crystals that provide coverage up to |\u03b7| = 3.0. The HCAL consists of a sampling calorimeter, which utilizes alternating layers of brass as an absorber and plastic scintillator as an active material, covering the range |\u03b7| < 3, and is extended to |\u03b7| < 5 by a forward hadron calorimeter. The muon system covers the region |\u03b7| < 2.4 and consists of up to four planes of gas ionization muon detectors installed outside the solenoid and sandwiched between the layers of the steel flux-return yoke.

The signal region for the search for heavy composite Majorana neutrinos is defined by requiring two leptons, selected without specifying the charge, with invariant mass m > 300 GeV and at least one large-radius jet satisfying the previously described requirements. The requirement on m is introduced in order to reduce the DY background and part of the tt background, without affecting the signal acceptance. With this selection, the total efficiency for events entering the signal region is expected to be about 50% in the eeqq channel and 75% in the \u03bc\u03bcqq channel, for masses of N greater than 1 TeV and = 9 TeV. We find that the total signal efficiency varies by at most 25% for signal samples produced with of 1 and 13 TeV, while it changes less than 3% for signal samples generated with between 5 and 13 TeV. A shape-based analysis is performed, searching for evidence of a signal by considering the distribution of the mass of the two leptons and the leading large-radius jet, m J . This variable provides good discrimination between the signal and the SM background contributions, as can be seen in Fig. 4.",

These two sources of background are always considered together in this analysis and the combination is referred to as tt + tW. The estimation is performed using a control sample in data free of signal contamination. This control sample consists of qq events in which one lepton is required to be an electron and the other a muon. The acceptance and efficiency differ between muons and electrons, and we find that the overall event efficiency depends most strongly on the kinematics of the leading lepton. We therefore define samples of separate and distinct final states e\u03bcJ and \u03bceJ, where the first named lepton is the leading one, as control samples for the signal samples eeJ and \u03bc\u03bcJ, respectively. All other requirements are the same for both the control and signal samples. We have verified that the m eeJ and m \u03bc\u03bcJ distributions are well-modelled by the corresponding m e\u03bcJ and m \u03bceJ distributions using the MC samples. Fig. 3 shows good agreement between data and expectation from MC simulation for the m e\u03bcJ and the m \u03bceJ distributions. Backgrounds from processes other than tt + tW in these control samples are estimated from simulation and subtracted prior to being transferred to the signal region. The final tt + tW contribution is estimated from the mass shapes of the different flavour control regions scaled to the signal regions by transfer factors. The transfer factors depend on m J and are estimated in bins corresponding to those of Fig. 3, which are then used for the final mass distributions in the signal regions. They are evaluated using MC simulation and account for differences in acceptances and efficiencies of selected e\u03bcqq and \u03bceqq events of the control regions with respect to the selected eeqq and \u03bc\u03bcqq events of the signal regions.",

We verify this with a method developed in the CMS search for Z -like resonances in electron pair or muon pair final states [37].

The contamination from sub dominant backgrounds in these control regions has a negligible effect on the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties related to the background estimations vary between 20 and 30% (40 and 100%) from the lowest to the highest mass bin in which the tt + tW (DY) processes contribute. The uncertainty associated with the estimation of the W+jets and diboson backgrounds, which together represent only a small fraction of the events in the signal region, has a negligible impact on the limit calculation. The uncertainty in the acceptance associated with the PDFs is evaluated in accordance with the PDF4LHC recommendations [38], using the PDF4LHC15 Hessian PDF set with 100 eigenvectors. The PDF uncertainty amounts to 10% for the DY background and 4% for the signal. Uncertainties related to the trigger, and to lepton reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies are measured by dedicated analyses using Z \u2192 events [32,33] and amount on average to 3% (6%) for the background and 4% (10%) for the signal in the electron (muon) channel. The systematic uncertainty in the lepton energy scale and resolution are found to be approximately 5% (6%) for the background and 3% (4%) for the signal. The uncertainty related to jet energy scale amounts to 3% (4%) for the background of the eeqq (\u03bc\u03bcqq ) channel, and around 1% for the 2.4 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b1 0.1 3 .2 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b1 0.4 signal regardless of the channel. Uncertainties related to jet energy resolution correspond to 2 and 4% for the background and the signal, respectively, in both channels. The imperfect modelling of pileup interactions leads to a systematic uncertainty of about 4% for background and 2% for signal. The uncertainty in the total integrated luminosity amounts to 2.3% for the 2015 data [13]. Table 1 lists the estimated background yields, the total number of observed events for each channel and the number of events ex-  Distributions of m J are shown in Fig. 4, where the data are compared with the estimated SM backgrounds and two different signal hypotheses are superimposed.
