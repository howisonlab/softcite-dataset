            "text": "Following the ending of the Tevatron collider program, we can review the significant progress that has been made in the diboson sector over the ten years of Run 2. At the start of Run 2, WW was the only massive diboson state to have been measured, with only a handful of events. In the intervening years, the WZ and ZZ processes have been observed (in 2007 and 2008 respectively), and the new availability of theoretical tools such as \uf76d\uf763\uf766\uf76d [1] and \uf76d\uf763@\uf76e\uf76c\uf76f [2] has allowed the standard model to be tested in the diboson sector. Measuring diboson production addresses the basic physics interest of observing fundamental electroweak processes. Measuring increasingly small cross-sections is a stepping-stone to new physics; and as diboson production is a major background to Higgs searches, it is important to understand it. Furthermore, measuring diboson production allows access to triple gauge couplings, which could provide indications of new physics.",

Events are selected with an electron or muon, a photon, and missing transverse energy ( E T ). This analysis uses a neural network for photon identification to improve sensitivity to WW\u03b3 coupling. Backgrounds are at the 20 \u2212 25% level, overwhelmingly W+jets, and are estimated from data. An important property of the standard model prediction at leading order is that interference between the s-and t-channel amplitudes produces a zero in the total W\u03b3 yield at a specific angle \u03b8 * between the W boson and the incoming quark in the W\u03b3 rest frame. Although it is difficult to measure the angle directly, this so-called 'radiation amplitude zero' is also visible in the charge-signed photon-lepton rapidity difference as a dip at around -1/3. Figure 1 shows the dip, a e-mail: aidan.robson@glasgow.ac.uk compared with the signal prediction from the Baur-Berger dedicated event generator [3] interfaced to \uf770\uf779\uf774\uf768\uf769\uf761 [4] for showering. The measured cross-section for the kinematic region E T (\u03b3) > 15 GeV and \u2206R( \u03b3) > 0.7 is \u03c3(pp \u2192 W\u03b3 + Z \u2192 \u03b3 + X) = (7.6\u00b10.4(stat)\u00b10.6(sys)) pb, in good agreement with the standard model prediction 7.6\u00b1 0.2 pb. If there were anomalous triple gauge couplings, the photon E T spectrum would be modified and more high-E T photons observed. The photon E T spectrum may therefore be used to derive limits on anomalous WW\u03b3 couplings. A binned likelihood fit to data is used, and the 1-d limits 95% CL limits obtained are \u22120.4 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 < 0.4 and \u22120.08 < \u03bb \u03b3 < 0.07 for a new physics scale \u039b = 2 TeV.",

Again, a neural network technique that uses five variables from tracking, calorimetry, and the preshower detectors provides robust differentiation between photons and jets. Background is at the 5 \u2212 10% level and is dominated by Z+jets. Around 1000 events are observed in each of the final states Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 + \u03b3 and Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 + \u03b3. The Z\u03b3 system has the property that initial state photon radiation (ISR) may be selected preferentially over final state photon radiation by requiring the three-body invariant mass M( \u03b3) to be above the Z boson mass. With M( \u03b3) > 110 GeV/c 2 , around 300 events are observed in each of the final states. The differential cross-section d\u03c3/d p T (\u03b3) is measured, using matrix inversion to unfold the experimental distribution, and is shown in Figure 2 both for all M( \u03b3), and for the ISR-dominated sample M( \u03b3) > 110 GeV/c 2 . Prior to this analysis, these differential distributions had not been shown. The data are compared with the NLO prediction from \uf76d\uf763\uf766\uf76d, and are seen to be consistent. Total cross-sections are also quoted: for the kinematic region |\u03b7(\u03b3)| < 1, E T (\u03b3) > 10 GeV, \u2206R( \u03b3) > 0.7 and M( \u03b3) > 60 GeV/c 2 the result is \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3) = (1.09 \u00b1 0.04(stat) \u00b1 0.07(sys)) pb, to be compared with the standard model prediction 1.10\u00b10.03 pb; and for M( \u03b3) > 110 GeV/c 2 the result is \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z\u03b3 The most stringent anomalous coupling limits in Z\u03b3 are from CDF, in another 2011 result [5]. Here, Z \u2192 + \u2212 + \u03b3 events are selected with M( \u03b3) > 100 GeV/c 2 , and Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd is also included through events having E T > 50 GeV. For the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd + \u03b3 selection, events with tracks having p T > 10 GeV or jets having E T > 15 GeV are rejected, and calorimeter timing information is used to reject cosmic-ray tracks.",

Events having two oppositely-charged leptons and E T are selected. Around 12% of the acceptance comes from \u03c4 leptons decaying to electrons or muons. Control samples such as same-sign dileptons check background modelling. The analysis uses a matrix element probability approach, where transfer functions derived from simulation are applied to the measured four-vectors, which are inputs to matrix elements that allow the computation of probabilities that an event comes from signal or one of several background processes. These probabilities are put together in a likelihood ratio, and the cross-section is extracted from a fit as shown in Figure 1. With 3.6 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, CDF measures \u03c3(pp \u2192 WW) = (12.1 \u00b1 0.9(stat) +1.6 \u22121.4 (sys)) pb. A small excess in the high tail of the lepton p T spectrum makes anomalous triple gauge coupling limits less stringent than expected. The probability that the observed dis-tribution is drawn from the standard model is not too small (7%), so the small excess is ascribed to a statistical fluctuation. The best limits come from D0's 1 fb \u22121 analysis [8], and at 95% CL are \u22120.54 < \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 < 0.83, \u22120.14 < \u03bb \u03b3 = \u03bb Z < 0.18, and \u22120.14 < \u2206g Z 1 < 0.30 for a new physics scale \u039b = 2 TeV.",

            "text": "Given their similarity to key Higgs boson signatures, there have been ongoing efforts to observe diboson production in final states with jets. Two CDF analyses observed WW and WZ production in the \u03bd j j final state in 2010. This final state is very similar to that expected from WH associated production. W+jets is the overwhelming background. In the first analysis, the background contribution from QCD was fitted from data using the E T distribution, where for the analysis selection, QCD enters at low values, and electroweak processes have high values. The signal was extracted from a \u03c7 2 fit to the dijet mass distribution as shown in Figure 5, giving an extracted cross-section \u03c3(WW + WZ) = (18.1 \u00b1 3.3(stat) \u00b1 2.5(sys)) pb with 5.2\u03c3 significance [14]. The second analysis used a matrix element technique, for which the final  event probability discriminant is shown in Figure 5. Here, the extracted cross-section was \u03c3(WW + WZ) = 16.5 +3.3 \u22123.0 pb, with 5.4\u03c3 significance [14].",

A random forest multivariate discriminant is used to separate signal from background, and since Z bosons can decay to b-quark pairs but W bosons cannot, b-tagging is employed both to improve the significance of the observation, and to separate the WW and WZ components. Both the random forest discriminant output, and the dijet invariant mass for the no b-tag data sample, are shown in Figure 6. A cross-section \u03c3(WW + WZ) = 19.6 +3.1 \u22123.0 pb is measured, with 8\u03c3 significance, and contours of the separated WW and WZ cross-sections are given in Figure 6.",
