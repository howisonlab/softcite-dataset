If such interactions exist, particles of DM could be produced at the LHC. Since DM particles themselves do not produce signals in the LHC detectors, one way to observe them is when they are produced in association with a visible SM particle X(=g, q, \u03b3 , Z , W , or h). Such reactions, which are observed at colliders as particles or jets recoiling against an invisible state, are called ''mono-X'' or / E T +X reactions (see e.g Refs. [1][2][3][4][5]), where / E T is the missing transverse momentum observable in the detector.",

            "text": "Early Tevatron and LHC Run-1 searches for / E T +X signatures at CDF [6], ATLAS [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] and CMS [15][16][17][18][19][20][21], employed a basis of contact interaction operators in effective field theories (EFTs) [22,23] to calculate the possible signals. These EFTs assume that production of DM takes place through a contact interaction involving a quark-antiquark pair, or two gluons, and two DM particles. In this case, the missing energy distribution of the signal is determined by the nature and the mass of the DM particles and the Lorentz structure of the interaction. Only the overall production rate is a free parameter to be constrained or measured. Provided that the contact interaction approximation holds, these EFTs provide a straightforward way to compare the results from different collider searches with non-collider searches for DM. The EFT describes the case when the mediator of the interaction between SM and DM particles are very heavy; if this is not the case, models that explicitly include these mediators are needed [5,22,24,[24][25][26][27][28]. Some ''simplified models'' [29][30][31] of DM production were constructed, including particles and interactions beyond the SM. These models can be used consistently at LHC energies, and provide an extension to the EFT approach. Many proposals for such models have emerged (see, for example Refs. [32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48]). At the LHC, the kinematics of mono-X reactions occurring via a TeV-scale mediator can differ substantially from the prediction of the contact interaction. The mediator may also produce qualitatively different signals, such as decays back into the SM particles. Thus, appropriate simplified models are an important component of the design, optimization, and interpretation of DM searches at ATLAS and CMS. This has already been recognized in the CDF, ATLAS and CMS searches quoted above, where both EFT and selected simplified model results are presented.",

This report intends to follow this strategy, firstly focusing on simplified models that allow the exploration of scenarios where the mediating scale is not as large. In the limit of large mediator mass, the simplified models map onto the EFT operators. Secondly, this report considers specific EFT benchmarks whenever neither a simplified model completion nor other simplified models yielding similar kinematic distributions are available and implemented in one of the event generators used by both collaborations. This is the case for dimension-5 or dimension-7 operators with direct DM-electroweak boson couplings. 3 Considering these models as separate experimental benchmarks will allow to target new signal regions and help validate the contact interaction limit of new simplified models developed to complete these specific operators. Results from these EFT benchmarks should include the condition that the momentum transfer does not probe the scale of the interaction; whenever there is no model that allows a direct mapping between these two quantities, various options should be tested to ensure a given fraction of events within the range of applicability of the EFT approach. Experimental searches should in any case deliver results that are independent from the specific benchmark tested, such as fiducial cross-sections that are excluded in a given signal region.",

In this case, both simplified models leading to mono-boson signatures and contact interaction operators are considered. Details of the state of the art calculations and on the implementation of the simplified models in Monte Carlo generators are provided in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the treatment of the presentation of results for the benchmark models from contact interaction operators. Section 6 prescribes how to estimate theoretical uncertainties on the simulation of these models. Section 7 concludes the report. Further models that could be studied beyond early searches and their implementation are described in Appendix A. For these models, either the implementation could not be fully developed by the time of this report, or some of the grounding assumptions were not fully met. Some of these models have been used in previous ATLAS and CMS analyses and discussed thoroughly within the Forum. They are therefore worth considering for further studies and for Run-2 searches, since they lead to unique / E T +X signatures that are not shared by any other of the models included in this report.

A 300 and A 500 in the table denote the acceptance of the / E T > 300 GeV and / E T > 500 GeV cut, respectively. All figures in this Section have been obtained using the model implementation within the POWHEG generator (v3359) [61], interfaced to Pythia 8 [62] for the parton shower. case where M med > 2m \u03c7 , nor for the off-shell case where M med < 2m \u03c7 . Only the production cross sections change. Differences in kinematic distributions are expected only close to the transition region between on-shell and off-shell mediators. Special care needs to be taken when coupling strengths are combined with extremely heavy mediators. Fig. 4 suggests a change in the shape of the / E T distribution for a M med = 5 TeV mediator once \u0393 min /M med is of the order of a percent or lower. Such heavy mediators, although inaccessible with early LHC data, are interesting since they provide a good approximation for benchmark EFT models. The observed difference among the simplified models in the plot arises from the fact that the region of low invariant masses of the DM pair, m\u03c7 \u03c7 , is suppressed due to narrow Breit-Wigner peak that only probes a narrow window of parton distribution functions. For wider mediators, the low mass region is significantly enhanced by parton distribution functions at low Bjorken x, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). This explains why the sample with the narrowest mediator in Fig. 4 is heavily suppressed in terms of production cross section and also gives different / E T shape. Furthermore, Fig. 4 compares the vector model with 5 TeV mediator to the D5 EFT sample and reveals that the simplified models with larger mediator widths (e.g. for couplings of 1 where \u0393 min /M med \u223c 0.5) are the ones resembling the kinematics of contact interactions. This reflects the fact that in an EFT there is no enhancement due to on-shell mediators, leading to a closer resemblance to an off-shell regime where no peak in the m\u03c7 \u03c7 distribution is present. In case of narrow width mediators, e.g. \u0393 min /M med \u223c 0.05, even larger mediator masses need to be chosen in order to significantly suppress the peak in the m\u03c7 \u03c7 distribution and reproduce the kinematic shapes of an EFT model. Fig. 5(b) verifies that the choice of 10 TeV mediator mass is sufficient to achieve that.",

A 300 and A 500 in the table denote the acceptance of the / E T > 300 GeV and / E T > 500 GeV cut, respectively. The suppression by \u03b2 3 for m \u03c7 \u223c M med can be seen for the curves representing axial DM coupling. radiation of bosons [65], in combination with the low branching ratios if leptons from boson decays are required in the final state. The rates for the Higgs boson radiation is too low for these models to be considered a viable benchmark [48]. However, the presence of photons, leptons from W and Z decays, and W or Z bosons decaying hadronically allow backgrounds to be rejected more effectively, making Z/\u03b3 /W+ / E T searches still worth comparing with searches in the jet+ / E T final state (see e.g. Ref. [66]). In the case of a spin-1 mediator, an example Feynman diagram for these processes can be constructed by taking Fig. 1   [44,67,68]. An example of a model of this type is discussed in Appendix A.4.",

No preference is given between the two models as they have the same kinematics, although it is worth noting that the pseudo-scalar model has been used for a DM interpretation of the DAMA signal and of the galactic center  excess [72]. Like in the case of the vector and axial-vector models described in , the differences between the cross sections for the scalar and pseudo-scalar samples with the same m \u03c7 and M med are increasing with the DM mass for fixed mediator mass, with the pseudo-scalar model yielding larger cross sections.

The optimized parameter grid in the M med -m \u03c7 plane for scalar and pseudo-scalar mediators is motivated by similar arguments as in the previous section. Therefore, a similar pattern is followed here, with the exception of taking of the electroweak effects to tt production suggest that one can only expect percent level contributions for g q \u223c O(1) [73]. Therefore, keeping g q = g \u03c7 = 1 is a reasonable choice in the case of the scalar and pseudo-scalar mediators. Contrary to the vector and axial-vector models, note that couplings of 1 lead to \u0393 min /M med \u2272 0.1, ensuring the narrow width approximation is applicable. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the highest mediator masses has to be re-evaluated. The generator level cross section times the acceptance at / E T > 500 GeV for the model with couplings g q = g \u03c7 = 1, light DM of m \u03c7 = 10 GeV and a M med = 500 GeV scalar mediator is at the order of 10 fb, i.e. just at the edge of the early Run-2 sensitivity. Increasing the mediator mass to 1 TeV pushes the product \u03c3 \u00d7 A down to approximately 0.1 fb, below the LHC sensitivity. Therefore, we choose to remove the 2 TeV mediator mass from the grid and present the final grid with 33 mass points only, as shown in Table 5. One point at very high mediator mass (10 TeV) is added for each of the DM masses scanned, to aid the reinterpretation of results in terms of contact interaction operators (EFTs).",

[78] considers two extreme cases for this model in terms of cross-sections: the case in which all mediator flavors are present, leading to the maximal cross-section, and the case in which only right-handed down-type mediators are present. Neither of the models in this reference include couplings to the third quark generation, leading to a violation of the MFV assumption. In the case of purely down-type right-handed squarks this is still safe from flavor constraints. Furthermore, reintroducing the third generation squarks would lead to models that produce qualitatively similar signals in the mono-jet and SUSY squark searches, the main difference being the production cross-section. At the same time the presence of third generation squarks will lead to further constraints from other searches such as those for mono-bjets, for stops and for sbottoms, as discussed in Section 2.3.2. The studies in this Section are performed using a model with a mediator coupling to all three generation, following Ref. [46]. Further differences between the two models (hypercharge, chirality) only lead to a change in the cross-section. The LO UFO model is interfaced to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.3, but it was not possible to go beyond parton-level studies and interface those models to a parton shower in time for the conclusion of this Forum. The state of the art for calculating these models is LO+PS, and the implementation of multi-parton merging has been studied in detail [78,[81][82][83], and further studies should be undertaken prior to generating signal samples for early Run-2 LHC searches.",

In the MSSM, most of these processes are sub-dominant, even if resonantly enhanced, because the production is proportional to weak couplings. In the more general theories considered here, g is free to take on large values of order 1 or more, and thus diagrams neglected in MSSM simulation can occur at a much higher rate here.

[87,88]. We describe the b-FDM model of Ref. [88], created to explain the Galactic Center (GC) gamma-ray excess observed in data collected by the Fermi-LAT collaboration [89,90]. This model favors couplings to third-generation quarks via Yukawa couplings, therefore respecting the MFV assumption.  [91,92]. In the case where the top coupling is the main DM coupling, the signal is very similar to a signal from a stop quark, since unlike the other t-channel cases there is no top in the initial state parton distribution functions (PDFs). This is the reason why it was not considered as an additional model. More recent literature shows that other flavor states could also contribute to LHC signals, as shown in Ref. [93], but such models will have to be investigate on a longer timescale with respect to that of this Forum.",

On the contrary, both the SM and DM partial width have comparable contributions in case of scalar and pseudo-scalar mediators if the top quark channel is open (M med > 2m t ). However, mostly g \u03c7 defines the minimal width for M med < 2m t due to the Yukawa-suppressed light quark couplings. The performance of the cross section scaling is demonstrated in Fig. 35 where two mass points M med = 100 GeV and 1 TeV with m \u03c7 = 10 GeV are chosen and rescaled from the starting point g q = g \u03c7 = 1 according to Eq. (19) to populate the whole g q -g \u03c7 plane. This means the width is not kept constant in this test and this is done in purpose in order to point out deviations from the scaling when the width is altered. For each mass point, the rescaled cross section is compared to the generator cross section and the ratio of the two is plotted. For the given choice of the mass points, the scaling seems to work approximately within the precision of \u223c 20% in the region where \u0393 min < M med . Constant colors indicate the lines along which the cross section scaling works precisely and there is a remarkable resemblance of the patterns shown in the plots of the mediator width. To prove the scaling along the lines of constant width works, one such line is chosen in Fig. 36 for a scalar mediator, defined by M med = 300 GeV, m \u03c7 = 100 GeV, g q = g \u03c7 = 1, and the rescaled and generated cross sections are found to agree within 3%.",

In such models the full theory may be expected to contain additional operators with Higgs-Dark Matter couplings [104].

Ultraviolet completions where the operators are generated through loops of states charged under U(1) Y and/or SU (2) L have been proposed in [106] and their LHC signatures have been studied in [107]. If these new charged particles are light, the high-p T gauge bosons that participate in the / E T processes considered here are able to resolve the substructure of the loops. This generically suppresses the cross sections compared to the EFT predictions [108], and thus will weaken the bounds on the interaction strengths of DM and the EW gauge bosons to some extent. Furthermore, the light charged mediators may be produced on-shell in pp collisions, rendering direct LHC searches potentially more restrictive than / E T searches. Making the above statements precise would require further studies beyond the timescale of this forum.",

In monojet analyses, i.e. when final states are selected with a few jets and / E T , observables and in particular the / E T spectrum depend upon the accuracy of the simulation of QCD radiation. For the vector and axial vector models, the current state of the art is NLO+PS. It is particularly simple to obtain simulations for these processes at NLO+PS and even for merged samples at NLO accuracy, starting from SM implementations. We therefore recommend simulations to be performed at NLO+PS, and in case multi-jet observables are employed, by merging samples with different multiplicities. Results at such accuracy can be obtained either in dedicated implementations, such as that of POWHEG [61], or via general purpose NLO tools like Mad-Graph5_aMC@NLO employing available UFO models at NLO. A testing version of the full set of these UFO models has been made available only in June 2015 [113]. For this reason, it was not used as part of the studies of this Forum on initial Run-2 benchmark models. Nevertheless, we encourage further study of these UFO models by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.",

Because of the complexity of performing NLO calculations for this class of processes and in particular the absence of general methods for computing two-loop virtual contributions, only LO predictions are currently available. These can be interfaced to shower programs exactly as usual tree-level Born computations, i.e. by considering one parton multiplicity at a time or by merging different parton multiplicities via CKKW or MLM schemes to generate inclusive samples with jet rates at LO accuracy. For spin-0 mediators in the mono-jet final state, the top-quark loop is the most important consideration. The matrix element implementation with exact top-loop dependence of the s-channel spin-0 mediated DM production is available in MCFM [41,114] 13 at fixed order and in POWHEG [43] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [113] for event generation at LO+PS level. The POWHEG and MCFM implementations include the finite top quark mass dependence for DM pair production and one extra parton at LO. The same processes are available in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.3 and could be made available in the future in codes like Sherpa+OpenLoops/GoSam, including up to two extra partons in the final state.

Since this is a generation cut, the user must check that the choice of bornktmin does not change the cross section for signal events passing analysis selections. It is a good practice to use 10-20% smaller / E T value in the input card than the final analysis selection, and check that the final result is independent, by exploring an even smaller value of bornktmin.

In this report we have mostly employed MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO provides a flexible and easy-to-use framework for implementing new models via the FeynRules package. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO can perform both LO and NLO calculations in QCD, matched/merged to parton showers [83]. For NLO ones, dedicated UFO model implementations at NLO should be used. Several UFO models at NLO are publicly available that although not developed specifically for DM, are suitable to make mode independent simulations at NLO accuracy, including multiparton merging via the FxFx technique [121]. A dedicated DM UFO implementation has been developed and it has been released as a testing version [113].",

The largest differences among the samples are visible for the 1 \u2192 2 jets transition where the 30 GeV and 50 GeV scale lead to a drop of the rates around the matching scale values.

The production cross section of the Z+bb process can be calculated in the 'five-flavor scheme', where b quarks are assumed massless, and the 'four-flavor scheme', where massive b quarks are used [129][130][131]. Data slightly favor the cross-section predictions in the five-flavor scheme [132] for the 1 b-jet signature. In this document we have preferred the 5-flavor scheme due to its simplicity and cross section agreement within the SM. The PDF used to calculate these cross section is NNPDF3.0 (lhaid 263000). On the other hand, both data [132][133][134] and theoretical studies [135,136] suggest that the best modeling of an inclusive Z+bb sample especially for what concerns b-quark observables, is achieved at NLO+PS using a 4-flavor scheme and a massive treatment of the b-quarks. In Fig. 68 we show that, at LO, as expected, no appreciable difference is visible in the kinematics between either flavor scheme used for DM+bb. In our generation we have used NNPDF3.0 set (lhaid 263400).",

It also describes some that are known to be under development as the report was finalized. This document primarily presents studies related to simplified models. The presentation of results for EFT benchmark models is also discussed. The studies contained in this report are meant to highlight the use of EFTs as a benchmark that is complementary to simplified models, and to demonstrate how that collider results could be presented a function of the fraction of events that are valid within the contact interaction approximation.",

First and foremost, to accommodate the urgent need of a basis set of simplified models, this work has made many grounding assumptions, as stated in the introduction. Departures from these assumptions have not been fully explored. As a consequence, the list of models and implementations employed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for early LHC Run-2 searches is not meant to exhaust the range of possibilities for mediating processes, let alone cover all plausible models of collider dark matter production. Rather, it is hoped that others will continue the systematic exploration of the most generic possibilities for collider dark matter production, building upon the framework used in this report just as this report has relied heavily on the work of many others. This also applies to models that exist in literature but do not have an implementation yet: we hope that this work will further encourage the theory and generator community to improve the implementation of new models as well as the precision of the calculations of existing ones. The role of constraints on the mediator particles from direct past and present collider searches should also be developed further.",

The cross sections for the various mono-X and VBF signatures produced by this model are displayed in Fig. A.80.   3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 8.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 9.63 \u00d7 10 \u22122 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u03c3 SI (pb) 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 \u03c3 LHC (fb) 1.7 \u00d7 10 2 7.7 \u00d7 10 2 4.3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22121 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22122",

The aim of these codes is to provide a public library of LHC analyses that have been reimplemented and validated, often by the collaborations themselves. Such libraries can then be used to analyze validity of a BSM scenario in a systematic and effective manner. The availability of public libraries further facilitates a unified framework and can lead to an organized and central structure to preserve LHC information long term. The reimplementation of an analysis consists of several stages. Typically, the analysis note is used as a basis for the implementation of the preselection and event selection cuts in the user analysis code within the recasting frameworks. Signal events are generated, and passed through a parameterized detector simulation using software such as Delphes or PGS [103,191]. The reconstructed objects are then analyzed using the code written in the previous step, and the results in terms of number of events are passed through a statistical analysis framework to compare with the backgrounds provided by the collaborations.",

Appendix A. Additional models for dark matter searches A.1. Models with a single top\u2212quark + / E T Many different theories predict final states with a single top and associated missing transverse momentum (monotop), some of them including dark matter candidates. A simplified model encompassing the processes leading to this phenomenology is described in Refs. [155-157], and is adopted as one of the benchmarks for Run 2 LHC searches. The simplified model is constructed by imposing that the model Lagrangian respects the electroweak SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y gauge symmetry and by requiring minimality in terms of new states to supplement to the Standard Model fields. As a result, two monotop production mechanisms are possible. In the first case, the monotop system is constituted by an invisible (or long-lived with respect to detector distances) fermion \u03c7 and a top quark. It is produced as shown in the diagram of A.72(a) where a colored",
