Dijet masses up to about 4.5 TeV are probed. No resonancelike features are observed in the dijet mass spectrum. Limits on the cross section times acceptance are set at the 95% credibility level for various hypotheses of new phenomena in terms of mass or energy scale, as appropriate. This analysis excludes excited quarks with a mass below 4.06 TeV, color-octet scalars with a mass below 2.70 TeV, heavy W 0 bosons with a mass below 2.45 TeV, chiral W \u00c3 bosons with a mass below 1.75 TeV, and quantum black holes with six extra space-time dimensions with threshold mass below 5.66 TeV.",

The studies reported here select events containing two or more jets. The two highest-p T (\"leading\" and \"subleading\") jets are combined to determine the dijet invariant mass, m jj . High-transverse-momentum (high-p T ) dijet events are produced copiously by QCD processes, and can reach the highest mass scales accessible in LHC pp collisions. The QCD processes, along with a subpercent admixture of additional Standard Model (SM) processes, create a smooth rapidly falling spectrum in m jj . Many NP models describe new particles or excitations created as s-channel resonances with appreciable branching ratios to final states involving quarks and gluons (q and g), and can produce dijet final states. If the resonance width is sufficiently narrow, these NP signals would appear as local excesses (bumps) in the dijet mass spectrum over the smooth SM background.",

At the LHC, the CMS and ATLAS experiments have continued this program, starting from the first 2010 data [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. The most recent published ATLAS results used the 2011 data set of 4.8 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV [13]. In 2012, the LHC delivered an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 [15] in proton-proton (pp) collisions, roughly a factor of 4 more than used for previous dijet studies.

            "text": "8 TeV in 2012 increased the sensitivity in searches for new phenomena, and pushed exclusion limits to higher masses and energy scales. This increased kinematic reach, combined with a new online event selection strategy employed in the present analysis, provides the largest dijet invariant mass range coverage to date, from 250 GeV to 4.5 TeV. No significant excess is observed above the background. A number of NP models are compared to data to derive limits. The models chosen span a range of characteristic masses (or energy scales) and cross sections, and are complementary in terms of the flavor of their final-state partons. The benchmark models under consideration include excited quarks (q \u00c3 ) decaying to qg [16,17], color-octet scalars (s8) decaying to gg [18][19][20][21], heavy W 0 gauge bosons decaying to qq 0 [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29], two forms of chiral W \u00c3 gauge bosons [30][31][32][33] and quantum black holes [34][35][36][37] decaying to a mixture of quarks and gluons. The current dijet search also sets limits on new generic resonances whose intrinsic width is convolved with effects due to parton distribution functions (PDFs), parton shower, nonperturbative effects and detector resolution.",

Effects from additional pp interactions in the same and neighboring bunch crossings are corrected for using the calibration procedure described in Ref. [42]. Simulated QCD multijet events are used for the derivation of the jet calibration to the hadronic scale. They are produced with the event generator PYTHIA [43] 8.160, using the CT10 PDF [44] and the AU2 set of parameters to describe the nonperturbative effects tuned to ATLAS data (the AU2 tune) [45]. Detector effects are simulated using GEANT4 within the ATLAS software infrastructure [46,47]. Additional simulated minimum-bias events are overlaid onto the hard scattering, both within the same bunch crossings and within trains of consecutive bunches. The same software used to reconstruct data is used for the Monte Carlo (MC) samples. The level of agreement between data and MC simulation is further improved by the application of calibration constants obtained with in situ techniques based on momentum balancing between central and forward jets, between photons or Z bosons and jets, and between high-momentum jets and a recoil system of low-momentum jets [48].",

Dijet events from the delayed data stream fall primarily into the region between 750 GeV and 1 TeV. They are used to further increase the size of the analysis data set as follows. First, two independent data sets are built from the delayed and normal trigger streams. The m jj distributions from the two data sets have checked to be in agreement with a shape-only Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, leading to a probability of 86% for their compatibility. The two dijet mass distributions measured from these data sets are then averaged, using the effective integrated luminosity as a weight. The delayed stream increases the luminosity recorded in this region of phase space by up to an order of magnitude.

            "text": "The functional form was selected using a data set consisting of a quarter of the full data, a quantity known to be insensitive to resonant new physics at dijet masses above 1.5 TeV after the previous public result on 13 fb \u22121 of data [55]. A range of parametrizations were tested on the blinded data set using a k-fold cross-validation and there was found to be no substantial difference between the standard function of Eq. (1) and higher-order parametrizations, so the function with a simpler form and a published precedent was selected. The \u03c7 2 value of the fit to the blinded data set was 37 for 56 degrees of freedom using the parametrization of Eq. 1. The fit function showed good agreement to both the fully simulated dijet mass spectrum obtained from the simulated PYTHIA 8.160 QCD multijet events mentioned in Sec. III, corrected for next-to-leadingorder effects using the NLOJET ++v4.1.3 program [56,57] as described in Ref. [11], and from a large-statistics sample of generator-level events, for which the \u03c7 2 of the fit was 58 for 55 degrees of freedom. While the number of data events is matched or surpassed by the number of fully simulated events starting from dijet masses of roughly 2 TeV, the generator-level statistics is sufficient to reproduce that of data. The \u03c7 2 value of the fit to data shown in Fig. 2 is 79 for 56 degrees of freedom. Signif.",

Furthermore, to prevent any NP signal from biasing the background estimate, if the most significant local excess from the background fit has a p-value smaller than 0.01, the corresponding region is excluded and a new background fit is performed.

The acceptance for W 0 bosons decaying to quarks ranges from 48% at masses below 1200 GeV to 40% at 3200 GeV, driven by the rapidity selection criteria.

The sine of the mixing angle in this model (sin \u03d5 X ) is set to zero, producing leptophobic decays of the W \u00c3 that are limited to quarks. With sin \u03d5 X \u00bc 1, a leptophilic W \u00c3 would instead be produced with branching ratios divided equally between quarks (3 families \u00d7 3 flavors \u00d7 8.3%BR \u00bc 75%) and leptons (3 families \u00d7 8.3%BR \u00bc 25%).

The full template shape is considered in the limit-setting procedure, both in the fits to the data performed during the marginalization procedure 4 and in the likelihood for the determination of the 95% C.L. limit. The limit on \u03c3 \u00d7 A from data is interpolated linearly on the x axis and logarithmically on the y axis between the mass points to create a continuous curve in signal mass. The exclusion limit on the mass (or energy scale) of the given NP signal occurs at the value of the signal mass where the limit on \u03c3 \u00d7 A from data is the same as the theoretical value, which is derived by interpolation between the generated mass values.

Since the two fit functions provide background estimates that differ beyond statistical uncertainties, an additional uncertainty is introduced due to the choice of fitting function. The difference between the two background estimates is treated as a one-sided nuisance parameter, with a Gaussian prior centered at zero corresponding to the background estimate from Eq. (1) and truncated to one-\u03c3 corresponding to the background estimate from Eq. (2). The marginalized posterior indicates a preference for the alternative function. (2) Background fit quality: the uncertainty on the background parametrization from the fit is estimated by refitting bin-by-bin Poisson fluctuations of the data, as described in Ref. [77]. The resulting uncertainty is calculated by refitting a large number of pseudoexperiments drawn from the data, and defining the fit error from the variation in fit results in each bin: AE1\u03c3 in the uncertainty corresponds to the central 68% of pseudoexperiment fit values in the bin. (3) Jet energy scale: shifts to the jet energy due to the various jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty components are propagated separately through the analysis of the signal templates. Changes in both shape and acceptance due to the JES uncertainty in the simulated signal templates are considered in the limit setting. Combined, the JES uncertainty shifts the resonance mass peaks by less than 3%: this is the JES shift used for Gaussian and Breit-Wigner limits. (4) Luminosity: a 2.8% uncertainty [15] is applied to the overall normalization of the signal templates. (5) Theoretical uncertainties: the uncertainty on the signal acceptance for the model-dependent limits due to the choice of PDF is derived employing the PDF4LHC recommendation [78] using the envelope of the error sets of the NNPDF 2.1 [79] and MSTW2008LO. Renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties on the signal acceptance are considered for the W 0 and s8 signals but found negligible. Since the W 0 cross section estimation used in this analysis includes NNLO corrections, the uncertainties on cross section due to variations of the renormalization and factorization scales, the choice of PDF, and PDF \u00fe \u03b1 s variations on the theoretical cross section are considered as well. The effect of the jet energy resolution uncertainty is found to be negligible. Similarly, effects due to jet reconstruction efficiency and jet angular resolution lead to negligible uncertainties.",

In addition, novel trigger techniques have been employed to extend the search to low dijet masses. The data sample used in the current analysis consists of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, and the resulting dijet mass distribution extends from 250 GeV to approximately 4.5 TeV.

Apply the kinematic selection on the parton \u03b7, p T , and jy \u00c3 j used in this analysis, as in Sec. III. (2) Smear the signal mass distribution to reflect the detector resolution. The smearing factors derived from full ATLAS simulation of QCD dijet events can be taken from Fig. 11. 3Since a Gaussian signal shape has been assumed in determining the limits, any long tails in the reconstructed m jj should be removed in the sample under study. The recommendation (based on optimization using q \u00c3 templates) is to retain events with m jj between 0.8M and 1.2M. The mean mass, m, should be recalculated for this truncated signal. (4) The fraction of MC events surviving the first four steps determines the modified acceptance, A. (5) From the table in HepData, select m G so that m G \u00bc m. If the exact value of m is not among the listed values of m G , check the limit for the two values of m G that are directly above and below m, and use the larger of the two limits to be conservative. (6) To retain enough of the information in the full signal template, and at the same time reject tails that would invalidate the Gaussian approximation, the following truncation procedure is recommended. For  this mass point, choose a value of \u03c3 G =m G such that the region within AE2\u03c3 G is well contained in the (truncated) mass range.

            "text": "The following detailed procedure is appropriate for setting limits involving resonances that approximate a Breit-Wigner (BW) shape and extend with a low-mass tail due to effects of parton luminosity. For signals that are very narrow or whose tails deviate significantly from a BW, a truncation of the signal template suggested in the Gaussian limits in Sec. A 1 might be more appropriate. The results of Figs. 9 and 10 are provided in Tables I and II on HepData. (1) Generate a hypothetical new particle, with mass set to M and intrinsic width \u0393. As the PDF used to obtain those limits is CT10, the same choice is recommended for the event generation. Nonperturbative effects should be simulated after the hard scattering. (2) Smear the signal mass distribution to reflect the detector resolution. The smearing factors for the dijet mass are derived from full ATLAS simulation and can be taken from Fig. 11. 3The kinematic selection detailed in Sec. III should be applied to the simulated events. It should be checked at this point that the shape of the template after the y \u00c3 < 0.6 cut does not change significantly. For example, in a simple model with a flat distribution for the cosine of the polar angle of the jets in the rest frame of the resonance (cos \u03b8 \u00c3 ) that decays into two back-to-back jets (y lead \u2248 \u2212y sublead ), a cut on jy \u00c3 j \u00bc 0.5 \u00c3 jy lead \u2212 y sublead j < 0.6 imposes a cut on the unboosted rapidity distribution (jy lead;sublead j < 0.6). In the mass ranges investigated, this corresponds to a more stringent constraint than the \u03b7 BW < 2.8 acceptance correction, leading to an acceptance of \u223c0.5 that does not depend on dijet mass. Deviations from a flat acceptance of up to 20% can be observed in the tails of models with different angular distributions (q \u00c3 ; s8; W 0 ). 4The fraction of generated events surviving the first three steps determines the signal acceptance, A. (5) From the tables available in HepData, select the one corresponding to the production mode for the new resonance (gluon-gluon, gluon-quark, quark-quark or quark-antiquark) as the parton luminosities and hence the signal shapes differ. (6) Compare the tabulated 95% C.L. upper limit corresponding to the chosen M and \u0393=M values to the \u03c3 \u00d7 A obtained from the theoretical cross section of the model, multiplied by the acceptance defined in step (3) above and taking into account its branching ratio into dijets. If the exact values of M and \u0393=M are not among the listed values of m BW and \u0393 BW =m BW , check the limit for the two values of m BW that are directly above and below M, and use the more conservative of the two limits.",
