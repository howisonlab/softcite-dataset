We select events with two oppositely charged particles, assumed to be pions, with pseudorapidity j\u03b7j < 1.3 and with no other particles detected in j\u03b7j < 5.9. We require the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 system to have rapidity jyj < 1.0. The production mechanism of these events is expected to be dominated by double pomeron exchange, which constrains the quantum numbers of the central state. The data are potentially valuable for isoscalar meson spectroscopy and for understanding the pomeron in a region of transition between nonperturbative and perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The data extend up to dipion mass M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u00bc 5000 MeV=c 2 and show resonance structures attributed to f 0 and f 2 \u00f01270\u00de mesons. From the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 and K \u00fe K \u2212 spectra, we place upper limits on exclusive \u03c7 c0 \u00f03415\u00de production.",

            "text": "In quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions between quarks and gluons, calculations of hadronic interactions are most reliable in the perturbative regime of high four-momentum transfer squared, i.e., for distance scales much less than the size of hadrons, typically 1 fm. Diffractive processes with low transverse-momentum (p T ) [1] hadrons involve nonperturbative physics where Regge theory describes scattering processes [2,3]. The data presented in this paper, from proton-antiproton (pp) collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0.9 and 1.96 TeV, extend the experimental study of central exclusive production to above the charmonium threshold, where the calculation of exclusive \u03c7 c production by gluon fusion involves perturbative QCD processes [4,5]. Elastic scattering and other diffractive interactions are characterized by a large region of rapidity [1], \u0394y (or \u0394\u03b7 as an approximation), devoid of hadrons, called a rapidity gap. Such processes are described in Regge theory by the exchange of a pomeron, P, which at leading order is a pair of gluons in a color-singlet state [2]. Central exclusive production is here defined to be pp \u2192 p \u00f0\u00c3\u00de \u2295 X \u2295p \u00f0\u00c3\u00de , where X is a specific central (jy X j < 1) state and \u2295 represents a large region of rapidity, 1.3 < j\u03b7j < 5.9, where no particles are detected. The incident particles remain intact or dissociate diffractively (p \u2192 p \u00c3 ) into undetected hadrons. In this study we do not detect outgoing (anti)protons, and we include events where they dissociate into hadrons with j\u03b7j > 5.9. With two large rapidity gaps and central hadrons, the process is expected to be dominated by double pomeron exchange, DPE [2,3]. Only at hadron colliders with center-of-mass energy ffiffi ffi s p \u2273 50 GeV [6,7] are rapidity gaps larger than \u0394y \u00bc 3 possible with central state masses M\u00f0X\u00de up to about 2500 MeV=c 2 .",

Thus, DPE is a quantum number filter, favoring states having valence gluons, such as glueballs, i.e., hadrons with no valence quarks. Such states are expected in QCD, but 40 years after being proposed [13], their existence is not established [14]. More measurements in different production modes and decay channels should provide insight on the issue. In addition to its role in meson spectroscopy, DPE studies shed light on the nature of the pomeron. Data at different collision energies provide additional tests of the theory; in Regge theory the cross section for p \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u00fep, with the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 in a fixed central region, decreases approximately like 1= ln\u00f0s\u00de [15,16].",

The data, binned in M\u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00de and p T \u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00de, are divided by the acceptance and L eff to obtain the differential cross sections. The systematic uncertainty on the cross sections is dominated by the luminosity (6%) and the choice of exclusivity cuts, which affect both the candidate event selection and L eff . These cuts are varied in the data over a reasonable range, and the resulting systematic uncertainty is shown in the plots as shading.  Figure 3 shows the mass region from 1600 MeV=c 2 to 3600 MeV=c 2 , with a fit to a fourth-order polynomial. There is some structure up to 2400 MeV=c 2 .

However, our data include dissociation, with higher masses M\u00f0p \u00c3 \u00de allowed at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1.96 TeV, since we require gaps to \u03b7 \u00bc AE5.9 at both energies.

This is approximately uniform up to a sharp drop at M\u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00de \u00bc 1000 MeV=c 2 seen in previous experiments [3], where the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de and the K \u00fe K \u2212 threshold occur. The absence of a \u03c1 0 signal is expected, as it is forbidden in DPE, and the cross section for photoproduced \u03c1 0 -mesons is small, especially for 96 TeV for two charged particles, assumed to be \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 , with p T > 0.4 GeV=c, j\u03b7j < 1.3 and jy\u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00dej < 1.0 between two rapidity gaps 1.3 < j\u03b7j < 5.9. Only statistical errors are shown; systematic uncertainties contribute approximately 10% at all masses. The lines show predictions of Ref. [23] with two different pion form factors. We previously observed exclusive \u03c7 0 c production in the J=\u03c8 \u00fe \u03b3 decay channel [9], but the mass resolution was not sufficient to resolve the three \u03c7 c states, and the \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 mesons have much higher branching fractions to the J=\u03c8 \u00fe \u03b3 final state than the \u03c7 c0 \u00f03415\u00de. If all the J=\u03c8 \u00fe \u03b3 events were attributed to the \u03c7 c0 \u00f03415\u00de, d\u03c3=dyj y\u00bc0 \u00bc76AE 10\u00f0stat\u00deAE10\u00f0syst\u00de nb. The \u03c7 c0 \u00f03415\u00de decays to \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 (0.56%) and K \u00fe K \u2212 (0.61%), and the \u03c7 c1 \u00f03510\u00de and \u03c7 c2 \u00f03556\u00de mesons have smaller branching fractions to these channels. In addition, the CDF II mass resolution is approximately 25 MeV=c 2 , less than the mass difference between these states. We do not see significant excesses of events at M\u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00de \u00bc 3415 MeV=c 2 or at M\u00f0\u03c0\u03c0\u00de approximately 3280 MeV=c 2 where the K \u00fe K \u2212 final state would appear in this distribution. Using the known branching fractions [22], efficiency, and L eff , we find d\u03c3=dyj y\u00bc0 \u00f0\u03c7 c0 \u00de < 35.5 (23.4) nb at 90% C.L. in the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 (K \u00fe K \u2212 ) decay channels, respectively. These limits imply that \u227250% of our previous J=\u03c8 \u00fe \u03b3 events were from the \u03c7 c0 \u00f03415\u00de [9].",
