            "text": "Decays of the \u03a5(5S) resonance to channels with B + and B 0 mesons are studied using a 23.6 fb \u22121 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. Fully reconstructed B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 , B + \u2192D 0 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decays are used to obtain the charged and neutral B production rates per bb event, f (B + ) = (72.1 +3.9 \u22123.8 \u00b1 5.0)% and f (B 0 ) = (77.0 +5.8 \u22125.6 \u00b1 6.1)%. Assuming equal rates to B + and B 0 mesons in all channels produced at the \u03a5(5S) energy, we measure the fractions for transitions to two-body and three-body channels with B meson pairs, f (BB) = (5.5 +1.0 \u22120.9 \u00b1 0.4) %, f (BB * + B * B ) = (13.7 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 1.1) %, f (B * B * ) = (37.5 +2.1 \u22121.9 \u00b1 3.0) %, f (BB \u03c0) = (0.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 0.3) %, f (BB * \u03c0 + B * B \u03c0) = (7.3 +2.3 \u22122.1 \u00b1 0.8) %, and f (B * B * \u03c0) = (1.0 +1.4 \u22121.3 \u00b10.4) %. The latter three fractions are obtained assuming isospin conservation. New aspects of beauty dynamics can be explored using the large data sample recently collected by Belle at the center-of-mass (CM) energy of the \u03a5(5S) resonance (also referred to as \u03a5(10860)). Decays of bottomonium states with masses higher than the mass of the \u03a5(4S) are almost unexplored with only a very limited number of experimental and theoretical studies to date. At the \u03a5(5S) energy a bb quark pair can be produced and hadronize into various final states, which can be classified as two-body B 0 s (B 0 sB 0 [1,2], two-body B (BB, BB * , B * B , B * B * ), three-body (BB \u03c0, BB * \u03c0, B * B \u03c0, B * B * \u03c0), and four-body (BB \u03c0\u03c0) channels. Here B denotes a B + or B 0 meson andB denotes a B \u2212 orB 0 meson. The excited states decay to their ground states via B * \u2192 B\u03b3 and B * s \u2192 B 0 s \u03b3. Moreover, a bb quark pair can also hadronize to a bottomonium state accompanied by \u03c0, K or \u03b7 mesons, for example through a \u03a5(5S)\u2192 \u03a5(1S) \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay [3]. In addition, initial-state radiation (ISR) can affect the final states listed above and must be taken into account [4]. Fractions for all of these channels provide important information about b-quark dynamics.",

Within the large uncertainties this fraction is 1.6\u03c3 larger than the B 0 s event fraction f s = (18.0 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 3.2)%, directly measured by Belle [2]. Both values for this fraction were obtained assuming that contributions from channels with bottomonium states are negligibly small. Among the B +/0 pair events CLEO found the two-body fractions for the B * B * and BB * + B * B channels to be (74 \u00b1 15 \u00b1 8)% and (24 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 3)% [5], respectively.

The B * B * channel is predicted to be dominant with the fraction over all bb events within the range (30 \u2212 69)% [9,10]. In these model calculations the other two possible channels have smaller fractions with predictions covering a broad range. Multibody channels have also been theoretically studied [11,12]; the three-body fractions are found to be about two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the two-body fractions. Interesting information about a possible gluonic component of the \u03a5(5S) can also be obtained from measurements of the three-body decays [13], if 200 or more events can be reconstructed in a three-body channel.",

Therefore the five B decay modes are treated simultaneously everywhere below. First, events in the signal bands shown in Fig. 1 are projected onto M bc . To describe combinatorial backgrounds under the signal, we define sidebands, which have the same shape as the signal region, but are shifted by \u00b170 MeV in \u2206E, and project similarly onto M bc . Assuming that background is distributed linearly in \u2206E, we model the combinatorial background by taking the average of the two sideband M bc distributions. Figure 2(a) shows the M bc distributions for the pos-sible two-, three-and four-body channels obtained from MC simulation for the B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + decay. The threebody and four-body channels are simulated assuming a pure phase-space decay model. Figure 2(a) shows that the two-body channels are well separated. The three-body BB \u03c0, BB * \u03c0 + B * B \u03c0 and B * B * \u03c0 channels have broader distributions in the higher mass region M bc > 5.35 GeV/c 2 . The four-body BB \u03c0\u03c0 channel is the cross-hatched peak on the right side of Fig. 2(a). The matrix elements responsible for the three-and four-body decays are not known, and the rates of the three-and four-body contributions cannot be obtained in a model-independent way from a fit to these M bc distributions. We therefore restrict the fit to the region 5.268 GeV/c 2 < M bc < 5.348 GeV/c 2 to extract the two-body channel fractions. To obtain the sum of the other contributions in the large M bc region, only the events from the interval 5.348 GeV/c 2 < M bc < 5.440 GeV/c 2 are selected. For these distributions we apply a fit procedure similar to that used above to obtain the full f (B +/0 ) production rate for the entire interval 5.268 GeV/c 2 < M bc < 5.440 GeV/c 2 . The total signal yield, summed over all modes and channels in this region, is 228.7 +22.9 \u221222.3 . The fitting procedure used to extract the production rates of the two-body decay channels treats the five signal and five sideband M bc distributions simultaneously. The following four components with fixed shapes and floating normalizations are included in the fit for each distribution: BB, BB * + B * B , B * B * , and combinatorial background. The shapes of the signal components are taken from MC simulation, and those of combinatorial background are modeled by the sideband data. The normalization parameters (channel fractions) for the two-body components are constrained to be equal for all five stud-ied B decays. The sum of background-subtracted M bc distributions for the five studied B decays is shown in Fig. 2(b), where the result of the likelihood fit in the region 5.268 GeV/c 2 < M bc <5.348 GeV/c 2 used to obtain two-body channel fractions is superimposed. The fractions obtained from the fit are listed in Table II. The systematic uncertainties include all those described above as well as uncertainties due to the M bc signal shape modeling (3%). To reconstruct the three-body channels, we look for an additional charged pion produced directly in the B ( * )B( * ) \u03c0 + channels. For each charged pion not included in the reconstructed B candidate, we form rightsign B + \u03c0 \u2212 ,B 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , B 0 \u03c0 + or B \u2212 \u03c0 + combinations. We then compute the variables M mis bc and \u2206E mis for the missing B meson, using the energy and momentum of the reconstructed B\u03c0 combination in the CM:",

If the difference were due to BB \u03c0\u03c0 events, we would expect 4 \u00b1 2 events in the three rightmost bins of the \u2206E mis + M mis bc \u2212 m B distribution of Fig. 3(b), where only one is observed. In addition, the four-body channel is theoretically expected to have a rate at least an order of magnitude smaller than the three-body channel rates, because there is limited phasespace for the creation of an additional pion. Instead, we find that the deficit can be explained by ISR contributions such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(4S)\u03b3 \u2192 BB\u03b3. We calculate a probability of \u223c 10 % for hard photon emission [4] by the electron or positron beam with subsequent B production, and estimate that \u223c40 % of such events are due to radiative return to the \u03a5(4S) resonance. This esti-mate agrees with the observed residual and explains the peaking structure on the right side of Fig. 2(b), which is dominated by radiative return to the \u03a5(4S) or slightly higher energies. We analyze other potential sources and backgrounds for the events in the multibody region. The rate for a bb event to produce the \u03a5(4S) and two pions is expected to be less than 1 % [3]. The wide J P = 1 + B * * meson can be produced at the \u03a5(5S) CM energy with a subsequent decay resulting in three-or four-body channels, however this process is expected to be negligible due to the very small phase-space. The decay B 0 s \u2192 B + e \u2212\u03bd e could contribute as a background to the multibody channels, however, the corresponding branching fraction is estimated to be less than 10 \u22124 .",
