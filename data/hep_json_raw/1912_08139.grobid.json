In the dilepton mass-squared range 0.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and the pK \u2212 mass range m(pK \u2212 ) < 2600 MeV/c 2 , the ratio of branching fractions is measured to be R \u22121 pK = 1.17 +0.18 \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.07, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This is the first test of lepton universality with b baryons and the first observation of the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 .",

Since FCNCs are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM) and can only proceed through amplitudes involving electroweak loop (penguin and box) Feynman diagrams, these transitions are an ideal place to search for effects beyond the SM. The potential contributions of new particles to these processes can be manifested as modifications in the rate of particular decay modes, or changes in the angular distribution of the final-state particles. Hints for possible disagreement with the SM have been reported, for example in several measurements of angular observables [1][2][3][4] of rare b \u2192 s + \u2212 decays. The SM predictions of these quantities are affected by hadronic uncertainties and more precisely predicted observables are desirable.",

The most precise measurements of R K in the q 2 range between 1.1 and 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and R K * 0 in the regions 0.045 < q 2 < 1.1 GeV 2 /c 4 and 1.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 have been performed by the LHCb collaboration and, depending on the theoretical prediction used, are respectively 2.5 [10], 2.1-2.3 and 2.4-2.5 [11] standard deviations below their SM expectations [5,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. Further tests of LU in other b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions are therefore critical to improve the statistical significance of the measurement and to understand the origin of any discrepancies. At the LHC, \u039b 0 b baryons are produced abundantly and b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions can also be studied in their decays. The full set of angular observables in \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays has been measured in ref. [22] and CP asymmetries have been determined using \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays [23]. This paper presents the first test of LU in the baryon sector, through the measurement of the ratio of branching fractions for \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 decays, 1 R pK . Both the experimental signature of the decays and the large data sample available motivate the choice of \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 + \u2212 decays for this study. Similarly to other R H ratios, R pK is expected to be close to unity in the SM [24].",

[25]. The spin one-half of the \u039b 0 b baryon and the rich resonant structure of the pK \u2212 hadronic system [23,26] indicate a similar situation in \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 + \u2212 decays, where complementary constraints could be derived once the pK \u2212 resonant structures are analysed. Following the observations of ref. [23] on the hadronic system, this analysis is restricted to invariant masses m(pK \u2212 ) < 2.6 GeV/c 2 , where most of the signal occurs. The analysis is performed in a wide q 2 region between 0.1 GeV 2 /c 4 and 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 . The lower boundary is chosen to be far enough from the dimuon kinematic threshold so that the effect of radiative corrections is negligible on the R pK ratio, using similar arguments to those discussed in ref. [5]. The upper boundary is set to reduce contamination from the radiative tail of the J/\u03c8 resonance. Contamination from \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c6(\u2192 + \u2212 ) decays is estimated to be negligible, therefore no veto around the \u03c6 mass is applied to the dilepton spectrum.",

This approach helps to mitigate the significant differences in reconstruction between decays with muons or electrons in the final state, which are mostly due to bremsstrahlung emission and the trigger response. The experimental quantities relevant for the LU measurement are the yields and the reconstruction and selection efficiencies of the four decays entering the double ratio. The definition of R \u22121 pK ensures that the smaller electron yields are placed in the numerator, granting a likelihood function with a more symmetrical distribution. In order to avoid experimental biases, a blind analysis is performed. In addition to the determination of the R \u22121 pK ratio, this analysis provides the first measurement of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fraction and the first observation of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay. Due to the lack of information on the exact resonant content in the pK \u2212 spectrum, it is challenging to compute the expected branching fraction of these decays in the SM, for which no prediction has been found in the literature. Predictions for specific excited \u039b resonances, \u039b * , in the decays \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b * + \u2212 with \u039b * \u2192 pK \u2212 , have been computed [28,29] but cannot be directly compared to this result.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic (ECAL) and a hadronic (HCAL) calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger system consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and JHEP05(2020)040 muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The hardware muon trigger selects events containing at least one muon with significant p T (with thresholds ranging from \u223c 1.5 to \u223c 1.8 GeV/c, depending on the data-taking period). The hardware electron trigger requires the presence of a cluster in the ECAL with significant transverse energy, E T , (from \u223c 2.5 to \u223c 3.0 GeV, depending on the data-taking period). The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex, with a significant displacement from any primary pp interaction vertex. At least one charged particle must have significant p T and be inconsistent with originating from any PV. A multivariate algorithm [32] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.",

The pK \u2212 invariant mass is required to be smaller than 2600 MeV/c 2 . Each particle is required to have a large momentum and p T , and to not originate from any PV. In particular, for muon and electron candidates the p T is required to be greater than 800 MeV/c and 500 MeV/c, respectively. Kaon candidates must have a p T larger than 250 MeV/c and the proton p T is required to be larger than 400 MeV/c in Run 1, and 1000 MeV/c in Run 2. All the particles must originate from a good-quality common vertex, which is displaced significantly from all reconstructed PVs in the event. When more than one PV is reconstructed, that with the smallest \u03c7 2 IP is selected (and referred to as the associated PV), where \u03c7 2 IP is the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without tracks associated to the considered \u039b 0 b candidate. The momentum direction of the \u039b 0 b is required to be consistent with its direction of flight. When interacting with the material of the detector, electrons radiate bremsstrahlung photons. If the photons are emitted upstream of the magnet, the photon and the electron deposit their energy in different ECAL cells, and the electron momentum measured by the tracking system is underestimated. A dedicated procedure, consisting in a search for neutral energy deposits in the ECAL compatible with being emitted by the electron, is applied to correct for this effect. The limitations of the recovery technique degrade the resolution of the reconstructed invariant masses of both the dielectron pair and the \u039b 0 b candidate [11]. The distribution of q 2 as a function of the four-body invariant mass for \u039b 0 b candidates is shown in figure 1 for both muon and electron final states. In each plot, the contributions due to the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) resonances are visible. Despite the recovery of bremsstrahlung photons, the e + e \u2212 invariant-mass distribution has a long radiative tail towards low values. Due to the correlation in the measurement of the q 2 and the pK \u2212 + \u2212 invariant mass, the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c8(2S) contributions are visible as diagonal bands. Signal \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 + \u2212 candidates form a vertical band, which is less prominent for the electron mode due to worse mass resolution and lower yield. The effect of the resolution motivates the choice of invariant-mass ranges considered for the analysis, which is presented in table 1. The \u039b 0 b invariant-mass resolution and the signal and background contributions depend on the way in which the event was selected by the hardware trigger. The data sample of decay modes involving e + e \u2212 pairs is therefore divided into two mutually exclusive categories: candidates triggered by activity in the event which is not associated with any of the signal decay particles (L0I), and candidates for which at least one of the electrons from the \u039b 0 b decay satisfies the hardware electron trigger and that are not selected by the previous requirement (L0E). For the decay modes involving a pair of muons, at least one of the two leptons must satisfy the requirements of the hardware muon trigger.",

            "text": "After all the selection procedures described above, the dominant remaining background is that originating from the combination of random tracks in the detector. This source is referred to as combinatorial background, and its properties vary between different q 2 regions. The separation between the signal and the combinatorial background is achieved using a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm [39], which exploits the gradient boosting technique [40]. The classifier is constructed using variables such as transverse momenta, the quality of the vertex fit, the impact parameter \u03c7 2 of the final-state particles, the angle between the direction of flight and the momentum of the \u039b 0 b candidate, and the minimum p T of the hadron pair and of the lepton pair. For each run period, a single BDT classifier is trained for the resonant and nonresonant decays, where final states involving muons and electrons are treated separately. The classifiers are trained using simulated \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 + \u2212 decays, which are corrected for known differences between data and simulation (see section 4), to represent the signal, and candidates in data with pK \u2212 + \u2212 invariant mass larger than 5825 MeV/c 2 are used to represent the background samples. To avoid potential biases and to fully exploit the size of the data sample for the training procedure, a k-folding technique [41] is adopted, with k = 10. For each decay mode and run period, the cut applied on the classifier is optimised using a figure of merit defined as N S / \u221a N S + N B , where N S is the expected signal yield and N B is the expected background yield, which is estimated by fitting the invariant mass sidebands in data. The BDT selection suppresses the combinatorial background by approximately 97% and retains 85% of the signal. The efficiency of each classifier is independent of m(pK \u2212 + \u2212 ) in the regions used to measure the signal yields. Once all the selection requirements are applied, less than 2.5% of the events contain multiple candidates. In these cases, one candidate per event is selected randomly and retained for further analysis. The effect of the multiple candidate removal cancels in the ratios measured in this analysis.",

This quantity is found to be r \u22121 J/\u03c8 = 0.96\u00b10.05, where the uncertainty combines both statistical and systematic effects.

In the first case, the distribution presents a tail at low mass, due to unrecovered losses, but no tail at high mass and is thus modelled by a single CB function. The other two present a smaller tail at low mass, since energy losses are partially recovered, but also a tail at high mass, due to wrongly associated photons, and are modelled by the sum of two bifurcated CB functions. The tail parameters of these functions are fixed from fits to simulated signal. The proportions between the three cases are also obtained from simulation. Combinatorial and misidentified backgrounds are modelled in an analogous way to the muon mode. However, partially reconstructed backgrounds of the type \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 , where the \u03c0 0 is not reconstructed, cannot be efficiently excluded in this case, due to the worse resolution and the wider invariant-mass range used in the electron mode fit. This background is modelled using kernel estimation techniques applied to simulated \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK * \u2212 e + e \u2212 events, with K * \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 , since this is the most realistic physical background contributing to this type of decay. The yield of this component is free to vary in the fit to data. Finally, \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) decays that lose energy by bremsstrahlung can also pollute the nonresonant \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 candidates in the low invariant-mass region. This contribution is modelled using simulated events. Its yield is constrained in the fit, based on the measured \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) yield and the probability of such q 2 migration determined using simulated samples.

Uncertainties that are uncorrelated between different trigger and data-taking categories are taken into account as Gaussian constraints on the input parameters to the fit, so that they are accounted for by the uncertainty returned by the fit. Correlated uncertainties are accounted for by smearing the likelihood profile for the given parameter of interest. The main systematic uncertainties on the ratio of branching fractions, r B , come from the procedure used to correct the simulation for the imperfect description of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay model and the detector response. The first one is evaluated by reweighting the distributions of m(pK \u2212 ), q 2 and the helicity angles, cos \u03b8 K and cos \u03b8 , in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 simulation to match those observed in data, instead of the amplitude model of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) decay explained in section 4. The distributions of m(pK \u2212 ), q 2 and the helicity angles are corrected separately and the systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature. Since this is a decay-model effect, it is correlated between different data-taking periods. For the other corrections applied to simulation, which affect the efficiency ratios included in the fit, the systematic uncertainty is evaluated using an alternative parameterisation of the correction, as well as different control samples to deter- mine the corrections. After all the corrections are applied, a small disagreement between data and simulation is seen in the proton momentum and impact parameter distributions. An associated systematic effect is estimated by correcting these distributions to match those observed in data. A bootstrapping technique is used to evaluate the effect of the limited size of the simulated samples used to calculate the corrections. The systematic uncertainties accounting for data and simulation differences are computed separately for each data-taking period and trigger category and are thus uncorrelated.",

However, some additional sources have to be considered, which are specific to the electron mode and are related to the worse resolution of the nonresonant decay compared to the resonant one. The systematic uncertainty related to the normalisation modes takes into account both the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) yield uncertainties. Its value is smaller in Run 2, due to the smaller background level in the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) data, resulting from the tighter requirement on the proton p T . Signal decays that migrate in and out of the 0.1 < q 2 < 6 GeV 2 /c 4 window due to resolution effects are taken into account in the efficiency determination. However, potential mismodelling of the q 2 resolution or its distribution in the simulation can introduce a systematic bias. The first effect is estimated JHEP05(2020)040 by smearing the q 2 distribution of \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 decays in simulation according to the differences observed between \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) data and simulated candidates. Similarly, the effect of an alternative q 2 model is estimated by weighting simulated \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 events to match the q 2 distribution of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 decays generated with the model described in ref. [45]. This uncertainty is taken to be fully correlated between trigger categories and data-taking periods. Potential disagreement between the resolution in simulation and data for the m corr variable, which is only used in the selection of \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 candidates, is studied with \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) candidates. A correction is obtained by comparing the distribution of this quantity for \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) candidates in data and simulation and is applied to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 simulation. No significant variation on the efficiency is found but a systematic contribution corresponding to one half of its uncertainty is conservatively assigned and considered to be fully correlated between trigger categories and data-taking periods. Systematic uncertainties affecting the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 fit model are evaluated using pseudoexperiments. The scale factor of the signal width is varied by \u00b15%, the kernel of the nonparametric models describing the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 e + e \u2212 , B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 e + e \u2212 , \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 J/\u03c8(\u2192 e + e \u2212 ) backgrounds is varied and a component describing cascade H b \u2192 H c (\u2192 K \u2212 + \u03bd e X) \u2212 \u03bd e Y decays is added to the model. The largest effect comes from the limited knowledge of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 0 invariant-mass shape. It is alternatively obtained from simulated decays with an intermediate \u2206 resonance decaying to p\u03c0 0 , decays with an intermediate \u039b(1810) resonance decaying to pK * \u2212 , followed by K * \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and from decays with no resonant structure. The latter approach gives the largest variation in the signal yield with respect to the default fit model, which is assigned as systematic uncertainty. Ignoring this background in the fit model is also considered, but provides a smaller difference in the signal yield. These uncertainties are treated as fully correlated between trigger categories and data-taking periods. The systematic uncertainties associated to the measurement of R \u22121 pK are summarised in table 4. As a cross-check, the effect of all the corrections applied to the simulation is evaluated by removing them and estimating the change in the R \u22121 pK value. A 8.5% effect is observed on the double ratio.",

The measurement is performed in the range 0.1 < q 2 < 6 GeV 2 /c 4 and m(pK \u2212 ) < 2600 MeV/c 2 and the result is found to be R \u22121 pK = 1.17 + 0.18 \u2212 0.16 \u00b1 0.07, compatible with unity within one standard deviation. This result is also in agreement with the deviations observed in lepton-universality tests with B mesons [10,11], denoted R K and R K * 0 . More data is needed to confirm or exclude the presence of New Physics contributions in these decays. It should be noted that the current analysis is affected by different experimental uncertainties than those of lepton-universality tests performed with B mesons, such as the backgrounds that affect the extraction of the signal yields from data, or the control modes which are used to calibrate the simulation and measure the double ratio. Consequently, it provides an independent test of the SM.",
