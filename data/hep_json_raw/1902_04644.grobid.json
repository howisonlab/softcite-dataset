Ultralight bosons such as axions, axion-like particles, or dark photons could make up most of the dark matter. Couplings between such bosons and nuclear spins may enable their direct detection via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: As nuclear spins move through the galactic dark-matter halo, they couple to dark matter and behave as if they were in an oscillating magnetic field, generating a dark-matter-driven NMR signal. As part of the cosmic axion spin precession experiment (CASPEr), an NMR-based dark-matter search, we use ultralow-field NMR to probe the axion-fermion \"wind\" coupling and dark-photon couplings to nuclear spins. No dark matter signal was detected above background, establishing new experimental bounds for dark matter bosons with masses ranging from 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221216 to 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u221214 eV.",

Elucidating the nature of dark matter will profoundly affect our understanding of cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics, providing insights into the evolution of the universe and potentially uncovering new physical laws and fundamental forces beyond the standard model. While the observational evidence for dark matter is derived from its gravitational effects at the galactic scale and larger, the key to solving the mystery of its nature lies in directly measuring nongravitational interactions of dark matter with Standard-Model particles and fields.",

            "text": "To date, experimental efforts to directly detect dark matter have largely focused on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), with masses between 10 and 1000 GeV (3,4). Despite considerable efforts, there have been no conclusive signs of WIMP interactions with ordinary matter. The absence of evidence for WIMPs has reinvigorated efforts to search for ultralight bosonic fields, another class of theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates (5), composed of bosons with masses smaller than a few electron volts. A wide variety of theories predict new spin-0 bosons such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) as well as spin-1 bosons such as dark photons (1,6). Their existence may help to answer other open questions in particle physics such as why the strong force respects the combined charge-conjugation and parity-inversion (CP) symmetry to such a high degree (7), the relative weakness of the gravitational interaction (8), and how to unify the theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity (9).",

Another method to search for dark-matter bosonic fields was recently proposed: dark-matter-driven spin precession (17)(18)(19), detected via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques (18)(19)(20)(21)(22). These concepts were recently applied to data measuring the permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron and successfully constrained ALP dark matter with masses \u2272 10 \u221217 eV (22).",

For the next phase of the experiment, a substantial sensitivity improvement can be obtained by using so-called hyperpolarization methods to achieve much higher, nonequilibrium nuclear-spin polarization.

After polarization, each transient acquisition starts following a magnetic p-pulse (corresponding to a 180\u00b0flip of the 13 C spin along any direction). The external AC magnetic field's phase varies between transient acquisitions (orange). As a result, the sidebands generally have different phases in each transient spectrum. Averaging the transients yields a spectrum in which the sidebands are destructively averaged out (purple). Shifting each transient by a phase equal to the external field's accumulated phase restores the sidebands' phase coherence, yielding a spectrum with high SNR sidebands (orange). For clarity, only one of the two Zeeman-split J-coupling peaks and its two sidebands are shown. Bottom: Result of the phase-shifting procedure for actual data. (A) Transients are averaged using 2001 phase increments and stacked into a two-dimensional plot. (B) Side view of (A); sidebands are rescaled by a factor 10 for clarity. (C) Averaging with f = 0 rad corresponds to averaging the transients without phase shift; sidebands are averaged out and carrier peaks appear with maximum amplitude. When the optimal phase (for w/2p = 0.73 Hz, f = 2.93 rad) is approached, sidebands appear. These spectra were acquired in an experiment during which the AC field frequency and amplitude were set to 0.73 Hz and 0.24 nT.

Because parahydrogen can be flowed continuously into the sample, a steady-state polarization enhancement can be achieved (38), improving the experimental duty cycle.

We recall that the bosonic dark matter fields are coherent for a time t DM on the order of 10 6 periods of oscillation.

For integration times longer than the coherence time of the bosonic field T tot > t DM , the datasets have to be coherently averaged in sets of duration t DM using the phase-cycling procedure. This yields T tot /t DM sets of coherently averaged data. To profit from longer integration time and further increase the SNR, these sets can be incoherently averaged by averaging their power spectra, yielding a further SNR scaling as (T tot t DM ) 1/4 [see supplementary materials in (18)].
