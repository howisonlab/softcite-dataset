Assuming the ratio between the production cross sections \u03c3(W W ) and \u03c3(W Z) as predicted by the standard model, we measure the total W V (V = W, Z) cross section to be \u03c3(W V ) = 19.6 +3.2 \u22123.0 pb, and reject the background-only hypothesis at a level of 7.9 standard deviations. We also use b-jet discrimination to separate the W Z component from the dominant W W component. Simultaneously fitting W W and W Z contributions, we measure \u03c3(W W ) = 15.9 +3.7 \u22123.2 pb and \u03c3(W Z) = 3.3 +4.1 \u22123.3 pb, which is consistent with the standard model predictions. The study of the production of V V (V = W, Z) boson pairs provides an important test of the electroweak sector of the standard model (SM). In pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, the next-to-leading order (NLO) SM cross sections for these processes are \u03c3(W W ) = 11.7 \u00b1 0.8 pb, \u03c3(W Z) = 3.5\u00b10.3 pb and \u03c3(ZZ) = 1.4\u00b10.1 pb [1].

The D0 detector dijet mass resolution for W/Z decays of \u2248 18% results in significant overlap of W \u2192 qq and Z \u2192 qq dijet mass peaks. Therefore, we first consider W W and W Z simultaneously and measure the total W V cross section assuming the ratio of W W to W Z cross sections as predicted by the SM.

The fixed-order matrix element (FOME) generator alpgen [14] with CTEQ6L1 PDF is used to generate W +jets, Z+jets, and tt events. The FOME generator comphep [15] is used to produce single topquark MC samples with CTEQ6M PDF [13]. Both alpgen and comphep are interfaced to pythia for parton showering and hadronization. The MC events undergo a geant-based [16] detector simulation and are reconstructed using the same algorithms as used for D0 data. The effect of multiple pp interactions is included by overlaying data events from random beam crossings on simulated events. The next-to-NLO (NNLO) cross section is used to normalize the Z+jets (light and heavyflavor jets) [17]. The approximate NNLO cross section [18] is used to normalize the tt samples, while the single top-quark MC samples are normalized to the approximate next-to-NNLO cross section [19]. The normalization of the W +jets MC sample (for all flavor contributions) is determined from data.

This analysis uses a random forest (RF) classifier [26,27], from which the output distribution is used as a final variable to measure the production cross sections by performing a template fit. Fifteen well-modeled variables [28] that demonstrate a difference in probability density between signal and at least one of the backgrounds are used as inputs to the RF. Among these variables the invariant mass of the jet pair provides most of the discrimination between signal and background. The RF is trained using a fraction of each MC sample. The remainder of each MC sample, along with the multijet background samples, is then evaluated by the RF and used in the measurement. Depending on the source, we consider the effect of systematic uncertainty on the normalization and/or on the shape of differential distributions for signal and backgrounds [28]. Systematic effects on the differential distributions of the alpgen W +jets and Z+jets MC events from changes of the renormalization and factorization scales and of the parameters used in the MLM parton-jet matching algorithm [29] are also considered. Uncertainties on PDFs [30], as well as uncertainties from object reconstruction and identification, are evaluated for all MC samples.",

The W +jets normalization factor from the fit is consistent with the theoretical NNLO pre- diction [32]. The yields for signal and each background are given in Table I. Though the total diboson yield includes a small contribution from ZZ \u2192 \u2113\u2113qq events (1.5%), in which one of the charged leptons escapes detection, the cross sections presented here are corrected for this contribution assuming that the ratios between W W , W Z and ZZ cross sections are given by the SM.

Figure 1 shows the background-subtracted RF output distribution summed over all sub-channels after the fit. As a cross check, we perform the measurement using the dijet mass distributions in place of the full RF output distributions [28].
