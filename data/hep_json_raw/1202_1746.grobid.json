The selection cuts for suppressing the backgrounds while keeping very high signal efficiencies are described, along with the data-driven algorithms implemented to estimate the background yields and the systematic uncertainties. With an integrated luminosity of 1.66 fb \u22121 , upper limits at 95% CL on the SM-like Higgs cross section \u00d7 branching ratio exclude cross sections from about one to two times the expected value from the Standard Model in the range 150 < m H < 420 GeV. No evidence for the existence of the SM Higgs boson has been found so far.",

The signature of signal events is very clean: two pairs of same-flavour, opposite-charge, high-p T isolated leptons pointing to the same reconstructed vertex are looked for. Mass constraints can be set on the dilepton invariant mass: also at low m H , at least one Z boson is on-shell, therefore at least one pair of leptons has m + \u2212 m Z .",
