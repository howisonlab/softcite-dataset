The analysis was performed on a data sample of 2.98 \u00d7 10 8 events collected with a minimum-bias trigger. The corresponding integrated luminosity is L int = 4.8 nb \u22121 . Reconstructing the decay D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + , with \u03c6 \u2192 K \u2212 K + , and its charge conjugate, about 480 D \u00b1 s mesons were counted, after selection cuts, in the transverse momentum range 2 < p T < 12 GeV/c. The results are compared with predictions from models based on perturbative QCD. The ratios of the cross sections of four D meson species (namely D 0 , D + , D * + and D + s ) were determined both as a function of p T and integrated over p T after extrapolating to full p T range, together with the strangeness suppression factor in charm fragmentation. The obtained values are found to be compatible within uncertainties with those measured by other experiments in e + e \u2212 , ep and pp interactions at various centre-of-mass energies.",

            "text": "The measurement of open charm production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides a way to test predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the highest available collision energies. Charm and beauty production cross sections can be computed in perturbative QCD (pQCD) using the factorization approach [1,2]. In this scheme, cross sections are computed as a convolution of three terms: the parton distribution functions of the incoming protons, the partonic hard scattering cross section, and the fragmentation process. The partonic hard scattering cross section is computed through a perturbative calculation [1,2], while the parton distribution functions and the fragmentation process are parametrized on experimental data. In particular, the fragmentation describes the non-perturbative transition of a charm quark to a hadron. It is modelled by a fragmentation function, which parametrizes the fraction of quark energy transferred to the produced hadron, and by the fragmentation fractions, f (c \u2192 D), which describe the probability of a charm quark to hadronize into a particular hadron species.",

The measured p T -differential cross sections for prompt D 0 , D + and D * + are described within uncertainties by theoretical predictions based on pQCD at next-to-leading order (e.g. in the general-mass variableflavour-number scheme, GM-VFNS [5]) or at fixed order with nextto-leading-log resummation (FONLL [6]). The central value of the GM-VFNS predictions for these three mesons lies systematically above the data. On the other hand, the data tend to be higher than the central value of the FONLL predictions, as it was observed at lower collision energies, namely at the Tevatron [7,8], where hadronic decays of D mesons were reconstructed, and at RHIC, where measurements of electrons from semileptonic D and B decays were performed [9,10]. Heavy flavour production in hadronic collisions can be calculated also in the framework of k T -factorization with unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDFs) to account for the transverse momenta of the initial partons [11][12][13][14]. Calculations of inclusive production cross section of D mesons based on this approach in the leading order (LO) approximation were recently published for LHC energy and compared to experimental results [15,16].",

Preliminary results for D + s production at the LHC were reported by the LHCb Collaboration for prompt mesons at forward rapidity [17] and by the ATLAS Collaboration at central rapidity [18]  [19].

A p T dependence is expected for these ratios, due to differences in the fragmentation function of the charm quark in the four considered meson species, and because of the different contributions from decays of higher excited states. In this sense, the measurement of the ratios between the D meson species can provide information on the fragmentation functions that can be used in the pQCD models based on the factorization approach. The suppression of strange meson production in the charm fragmentation is quantified by the strangeness suppression factor, \u03b3 s , which is computed from the measured D 0 , D + and D + s cross sections extrapolated to full p T range, as defined in Section 6. The values measured at the LHC can be compared with those measured for different energies and different colliding systems [29].",

According to QCD calculations on the lattice, under the conditions of high energy-density and temperature that are reached in these collisions, the confinement of quarks and gluons into hadrons vanishes and a transition to a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) occurs [30]. Charm hadrons are a powerful tool to study the properties of the QCD medium created in these collisions [31][32][33]. In particular, the D + s meson is sensitive to strangeness production in heavy-ion collisions. Strange quarks are abundant in the QGP, resulting in an enhanced production of strange particles with respect to pp collisions [34][35][36][37]. Hence, at low momentum, the relative yield of D + s mesons with respect to non-strange charm mesons (such as D 0 and D + ) is predicted to be enhanced in nucleus-nucleus collisions [38][39][40], if the dominant mechanism for D meson formation at low/intermediate momenta is in-medium hadronization of charm quarks via coalescence with strange quarks [41][42][43].",

The various corrections applied to obtain the production cross sections are illustrated in Section 4. This also includes the estimation of the fraction of promptly produced D + s mesons. The various sources of systematic uncertainties are discussed in detail in Section 5.

The dE/dx samples measured by the TPC are reduced, by means of a truncated mean, to a Gaussian distribution with a resolution of \u03c3 dE/dx /(dE/dx) \u2248 5.5% [46]. The TOF detector is positioned at 370-399 cm from the beam axis and covers the full azimuth for the pseudo-rapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.9. The particle identification is based on the difference between the measured time-of-flight and its expected value, computed for each mass hypothesis from the track momentum and length. The overall resolution on this difference is about 160 ps and it includes the detector intrinsic resolution, the contribution from the electronics and the calibration, the uncertainty on the start time of the event (i.e. the time of the collision), and the tracking and momentum resolution. The start time of the event is defined as the weighted average between the one estimated using the particle arrival times at the TOF [47] and the one measured by the T0 detector. The T0 detector is composed of two arrays of Cherenkov counters located on either side of the interaction point at +350 cm and \u221270 cm from the nominal vertex position along the beam line. In this analysis, the time-of-flight measurement provides kaon/pion separation up to a momentum of about 1.5 GeV/c. The data sample used for the analysis consists of 298 million minimum-bias (MB) pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity L int = 4.8 nb \u22121 , collected during the 2010 LHC run period. The minimum-bias trigger was based on the information of the SPD and the VZERO detectors. The VZERO detector is composed of two arrays of scintillator tiles with full azimuthal coverage in the pseudo-rapidity regions 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7. Minimum-bias collisions were triggered by requiring at least one hit in either of the VZERO counters or in the SPD (|\u03b7| < 2), in coincidence with the arrival of proton bunches from both directions. This trigger was estimated to be sensitive to about 87% of the pp inelastic cross section [48,49]. It was verified by means of Monte Carlo simulations based on the PYTHIA 6.4.21 event generator [50] (with Perugia-0 tune [51]) that the minimumbias trigger is 100% efficient for events containing D mesons with p T > 1 GeV/c and |y| < 0.5 [3]. Events were further selected offline to remove the contamination from beam-induced background using the timing information from the VZERO and the correlation between the number of hits and track segments (tracklets) in the SPD detector.",

Before running the EvtGen decayer, the B admixture cross section predicted by FONLL was split into that of B 0 , B + , B 0 s and \u039b b by assuming the same p T shape for all hadrons and the production fractions from [52], namely 40.1% of B 0 , 40.1% of B + , 10.5% of B 0 s and 9.3% of beauty baryons. The resulting fraction of prompt D + s mesons, f prompt , depends on the p T interval, on the applied selection cuts, and on the parameters used in the FONLL calculation for the B meson cross section. It ranges from 0.93 in the lowest transverse momentum interval (2 < p T < 4 GeV/c) to \u22480.87 at high p T (>6 GeV/c).",

The estimated uncertainty is 4% per track, which results in 12% for the three-body decay of D + s mesons. Another source of systematic uncertainty originates from the residual discrepancies between data and simulation for the variables used to select the D + s candidates. The distributions of these variables were compared for candidates passing loose topological cuts, i.e. essentially background candidates, and found to be well described in the simulation. The effect of the imperfect implementation of the detector description in the Monte Carlo simulations was estimated by repeating the analysis with different sets of cuts. The cut values were changed in order to vary the efficiency of signal selection by at least 20% in all p T intervals. A systematic uncertainty of 15% was estimated from the spread of the resulting corrected yields. Part of this uncertainty is due to residual detector misalignment effects not fully described in the simulation. To estimate this contribution, the secondary vertices in the simulation were reconstructed also after a track-by-track scaling of the impact parameter residuals with respect to their true value. In particular, a scaling factor of 1.08, tuned to reproduce the impact parameter resolution observed in the data (see [3]), was used. The resulting variation of the efficiency was found to be 4% in the lowest p T interval used in this analysis and less than 1% for p T > 6 GeV/c. This contribution was not included explicitly in the systematic uncertainty, because it is already accounted for in the cut variation study.",

In addition, the PID efficiency, was estimated by comparing the reduction of signal yield due to the PID selection in data and in simulation, when the same topological cuts are applied. Due to the limited statistical significance, this check could be performed in data only for D + s candidates integrated over the transverse momentum range 4 < p T < 12 GeV/c. From these studies, a systematic uncertainty of 7%, independent of p T , was assigned to the PID selection. The contribution to the measured yield from D + s decaying into the K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + final state via other resonant channels (i.e. not via a \u03c6 meson) was found to be less than 1% due to the much lower selection efficiency, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2 for the case of the decay through a K * 0 . The contamination from other decay chains (all having smaller branching ratios than the two reported in Fig. 2) was also found to be negligible. The effect on the selection efficiency due to the shape of the D + s p T spectrum used in the simulation was estimated from the relative difference between the Monte Carlo efficiencies obtained using two different p T shapes, namely those from PYTHIA [50] with Perugia-0 tune [51] and from the FONLL pQCD calculation [1,6]. The resulting contribution to the systematic uncertainty was found to be 3% in the two lowest p T intervals, where the selection efficiency is strongly p T dependent, and 2% at higher p T . The systematic uncertainty from the subtraction of feed-down D mesons was estimated following the same approach as used for D 0 , D + and D * + mesons [3]. The contribution of the FONLL perturbative uncertainties was included by varying the heavyquark masses and the factorization and renormalization scales, \u03bc F and \u03bc R , independently in the ranges 0.5 < \u03bc F /m T < 2, 0.5 < \u03bc R /m T < 2, with the constraint 0.",

The uncertainty on the tracking efficiency cancels completely in the ratios between production cross sections of mesons reconstructed from three-body decay channels (D + , D * + and D + s ), while a 4% systematic error was considered in the ratios involving the D 0 mesons, which are reconstructed from a two-particle final state.

Thus, the perturbative uncertainty cancels almost completely in the ratio, as it can be seen in Fig. 4 where, for both FONLL and GM-VFNS, the line shows the result obtained from the central values of the theoretical predictions, and the shaded area spans the region between the ratios computed with the upper and lower limits of the theoretical uncertainty band. The predictions from FONLL and GM-VFNS agree within uncertainties with the measured particle ratios.   [57] with r = 0.1. The uncertainty on the extrapolation factor was obtained as a quadratic sum of the uncertainties from charm mass and perturbative scales, varied in the ranges described above, and from the CTEQ6.6 parton distribution functions [67]. Furthermore, to account for the uncertainty on the D + s fragmentation function, the extrapolation factors and their uncertainties were also computed using the FONLL predictions for D 0 , D + and D * + mesons and the envelope of the results was assigned as systematic uncertainty. The resulting value for the extrapolation factor is 2.  [3] were corrected to account for the updated value of the pp minimum-bias cross section. The systematic uncertainties on the ratios were computed taking into account the correlated and uncorrelated sources as described above. The resulting values are reported in Table 4 and shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 5 together with the results by other experiments that measured prompt charm production: LHCb [17], e + e \u2212 data (taken from the compilation in [68]), and ep data in photoproduction from ZEUS [29] and DIS from H1 [22]. The error bars are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties and do not include the uncertainty on the decay branching ratios, which are common to all experiments. The particle ratios for ZEUS and e + e \u2212 were computed from the compilation of fragmentation fractions f (c \u2192 D) published in [29] after updating the branching ratios of the considered decay channels to the most recent values [52]. For the ZEUS data, the systematic uncertainties were propagated to the particle ratios by properly taking into account correlated and uncorrelated sources [69]. For the H1 data, the D meson ratios were computed starting from the unconstrained values of f (c \u2192 D) published in [22], taking into account the correlated part of the systematic uncertainty and subtracting from the quoted 'theoretical' uncertainty the contribution due to the decay branching ratio [70]. Also in this case, a correction was applied to account for the updates in the branching ratios of the considered decay channels. The ALICE results are compatible with the other measurements within uncertainties. The values predicted by PYTHIA 6.4.21 with the Perugia-0 tune are also shown in the figure, as well as those from a canonical implementation of the Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM) [71]. The values from PYTHIA were obtained by integrating the prompt D meson yields in the range |y| < 0.5 and p T > 0. The SHM, which computes the hadron abundances assuming that particles originate from a hadron gas in thermodynamical equilibrium, provides a good description of the measured hadron yields in heavy-ion collisions at various energies and centralities [72], but it can also be applied to small systems like pp [73,74] and e + e \u2212 [75,76]. The SHM results used for the present comparison were computed for prompt D mesons, assuming a temperature T of 164 MeV and  [18,22,29,68]. Predictions from PYTHIA 6.4.21 with the Perugia-0 tune and from a canonical implementation of the statistical hadronization model (SHM) [71] are also shown. The gray band represents the uncertainty on the SHM predictions due to the uncertainty on the volume and on the strangeness fugacity (see text for details).",

The measured differential cross section is described within uncertainties by the prediction from the GM-VFNS calculation, which is based on perturbative QCD at NLO with the collinear factorization approach, and it is compatible with the upper side of the uncertainty band of calculations based on the k T -factorization approach at LO.

The D * + s mesons produced in the c quark fragmentation were made to decay with PYTHIA and the resulting D + s were summed to the primary ones to obtain the prompt yield.

On the other hand, in both the pQCD calculations, the p T dependence of the ratios of the D meson production cross sections arises from the different fragmentation functions used to model the transfer of energy from the charm quark to a specific D meson species [28,65,66] and from the different contribution from decays of higher excited states. The parton fragmentation models used in the calculations provide an adequate description of the measured data. The measured D + s /D 0 and D + s /D + ratios do not show a significant p T dependence within the experimental uncertainties, thus suggesting a small difference between the fragmentation functions of c quarks to strange and non-strange mesons. A higher statistics data sample would be needed to conclude on a possible p T dependence of the ratios of strange to non-strange D meson cross sections.6.2. p T -integrated D + s cross section and D meson ratiosThe visible cross section of prompt D + s mesons, obtained by integrating the p T -differential cross section in the measuredp T range (2 < p T < 12 GeV/c), is \u03c3 D + s vis 2 < p T < 12 GeV/c, |y| < 0.5 = 53 \u00b1 12(stat.) +13 \u221215 (syst.) \u00b1 2(lumi.) \u00b1 3(BR) \u03bcb.The production cross section per unit of rapidity, d\u03c3 /dy, at midrapidity was computed by extrapolating the visible cross section to the full p T range.

The extrapolation factor was taken as the ratio between the total D + s production cross section in |y| < 0.5 and the cross section integrated in |y| < 0.5 and in the p T range where the experimental measurement is performed. In particular, the central value of the extrapolation factor was computed from the prediction based on the p T -differential cross section of c quarks from FONLL, the fractions f (c \u2192 D) from ALEPH[23],",
