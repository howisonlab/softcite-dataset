With a fiducial exposure of (3.69 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10 31 proton \u00d7 year after all selection cuts and background subtraction, we detected (14.3 \u00b1 4.4) geo-neutrino events assuming a fixed chondritic mass Th/U ratio of 3.9. This corresponds to a geo-neutrino signal S geo = (38.8 \u00b1 12.0) TNU with just a 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 probability for a null geo-neutrino measurement. With U and Th left as free parameters in the fit, the relative signals are S Th = (10.6 \u00b1 12.7) TNU and S U = (26.5 \u00b1 19.5) TNU. Borexino data alone are compatible with a mantle geo-neutrino signal of",

By measuring the geo-neutrino flux from all these elements, it is in principle possible to deduce the amount of the radiogenic heat produced within the Earth, an information facing large uncertainty and being of crucial importance for geophysical and geochemical models. The first experimental investigation of geo-neutrinos from 238 U and 232 Th was performed by the KamLAND Collaboration [1,2], followed by their observation with a high statistical significance of 99.997% C.L. by Borexino [3] and KamLAND 1  [4]. Both these experiments are using large-volume liquid-scintillator detectors placed in underground laboratories shielded against cosmic muons. Due to either low statistics and/or systematic errors, these measurements do not have the power to discriminate among several geological models. Analysis combining the results from different sites have higher prediction power, as it was shown in [4] and [6]. Therefore, new measurements of the geo-neutrino flux are highly awaited by this newly-born inter-disciplinary community. Several projects entering operation such as SNO+ [7] or under the design phase as LENA [8] or Hanohano [9], have geo-neutrinos among their scientific aims. In this work we present a new Borexino measurement of the geoneutrino signal with 2.4 times higher exposure with respect to [3]. For the first time, Borexino attempts a measurement of the individual geo-neutrino signals from the 238 U and 232 Th chains. We provide a detailed comparison of our measurement with the predictions of several geological models. In a combined analysis of the Borexino and KamLAND [4] data we provide an estimate of the mantle geo-neutrino signal.",

Several calibration campaigns with radioactive sources [10] allowed us to decrease the systematic errors of our measurements and to optimize the values of several input parameters of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The 278 tons of ultra-pure liquid scintillator (pseudocumene (PC) doped with 1.5 g/l of diphenyloxazole) are confined within a thin spherical nylon vessel with a radius of 4.25 m. The detector core is shielded from external radiation by 890 tons of buffer liquid, a solution of PC and 3-5 g/l of the light quencher dimethylphthalate. The buffer is divided in two volumes by the second nylon vessel with a 5.75 m radius, preventing inward radon diffusion. All this is contained in a 13.7 m diameter stainless steel sphere (SSS) on which are mounted 2212 8 PMTs detecting the scintillation light, the so-called Inner Detector. An external domed water tank of 9 m radius and 16.9 m height, filled with ultra-high purity water, serves as a passive shield against neutrons and gamma rays as well as an active muon veto. The Cherenkov light radiated by muons passing through the water is measured by 208 8 external PMTs also mounted on the SSS and define the so-called Outer Detector. A detailed description of the Borexino detector can be found in [11,12]. 1 An update of geo-neutrino analysis from KamLAND Collaboration [5] was released after the submission of this Letter and thus it was not considered in the combined analysis presented below.",

Since the vessel contamination is low, the vessel shape can be calculated only on a weekly basis. The precision of this method is 1.6%. It was calibrated by comparing the vessel shapes with those obtained by a dedicated LED calibration system [10]. The systematic error on the position reconstruction of\u03bd e candidates is 3.8% [3].

These transition periods are not used for solar-\u03bd studies, but, with special care can be used for \u03bd e studies. The 214 Bi(\u03b2)-214 Po(\u03b1) delayed coincidence has a time constant very close to the neutron capture time in PC. The \u03b1 particles emitted by the 214 Po usually show a visible energy well below the neutron capture energy window. However, in 1.04 \u00d7 10 \u22124 or in 6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 of cases, the 214 Po decays to excited states of 210 Pb and the \u03b1 is accompanied by the emission of prompt gammas of 799.7 keV and of 1097.7 keV, respectively. In liquid scintillators, the \u03b3 of the same energy produces more light with respect to an \u03b1 particle [22]. Therefore, for these (\u03b1 + \u03b3 ) decay branches the observed light yield is higher with respect to pure \u03b1 decays and is very close to the neutron capture energy window. We have observed such candidates restricted to the purification periods, having the corresponding increased Q delayed and positive (\u03b1-like) Gatti parameter. In order to suppress this background to negligible levels during the purification periods, we have increased (with respect to [3]) the lower limit on Q delayed to 860 p.e. and applied a slight Gatti cut on the delayed candidate as described above.",

The predicted amount of U and Th in the mantle can be obtained by subtracting their relatively well known crustal abundances from the BSE estimates. The mantle geo-neutrino signal on the Earth surface depends not only on the absolute abundances of the radioactive elements but also on their distribution in the present mantle. For a fixed mass of U and Th, the extreme cases of S geo (Mantle) are obtained by distributing their abundances either homogeneously in the mantle (so-called high model) or in an enriched layer close to the core-mantle boundary (so-called low model) [34,35]. In this perspective our results are summarized in Fig. 3, which is obtained by combining the expected geo-neutrino signal from the crust (LOC + ROC) with those from different BSE models reported in Table V of [6]. The current result cannot discriminate among the different BSE models.",

First, the corresponding LOC + ROC crustal contributions taken from [6] and [33], respectively, were subtracted from the measured S geo sig- The Earth releases radiogenic heat, H geo , together with geoneutrinos in a well fixed ratio, however the observed geo-neutrino signal depends both on the abundances of the individual radioactive elements and on their distribution inside the Earth. To extract the radiogenic heat power from a measured S geo is therefore model dependent. We have calculated the expected S geo (U + Th) as a function of the radiogenic heat produced by U and Th, H geo (U + Th), for the Borexino and KamLAND sites (see Fig. 4), and compared it to the Borexino and KamLAND [4] results. The allowed regions between the red and blue lines in the plane S geo (U + Th) and H geo (U + Th) contain models consistent with geochemical and geophysical data. For each total mass of U and fixed Th/U ratio, the maximal geo-neutrino signal (red line) can be obtained by maximizing the radiogenic material in the crust and allowing uniform distribution in the mantle. Similarly, the minimal signal (blue line) is obtained for the minimal radiogenic mass in the crust with the rest concentrated in a thin layer at the bottom of the mantle. The expected signal from the crust is taken from Table V of [6]. We have chosen as a reference the BSE model from [29], predicting that the silicate Earth contains m(U) = (0.8 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10 17 kg with mass ratios Th/U = 3.9 and K/U = 12 000. The green regions are allowed by the BSE model [29]. The arrow \"Min\" indicates the contribution of the crust only. The arrow for the fully radiogenic model indicates 39.3 TW: it assumes that the total Earth surface heat flux of (47 \u00b1 2) TW [38] is completely due to radiogenic heat from U, Th, and K. Taking the relative proportions from the BSE of [29], we get that in a fully radiogenic Earth, U, Th, and K produce 19.1, 20.2, and 7.7 TW, respectively.",
