            "text": "A measurement of the top quark-antiquark pair production cross section \u03c3 tt in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016. Dilepton events (e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , e + e \u2212 ) are selected and the cross section is measured from a likelihood fit. For a top quark mass parameter in the simulation of m MC t = 172.5 GeV the fit yields a measured cross section \u03c3 tt = 803 \u00b1 2 (stat) \u00b1 25 (syst) \u00b1 20 (lumi) pb, in agreement with the expectation from the standard model calculation at next-to-next-toleading order. A simultaneous fit of the cross section and the top quark mass parameter in the powheg simulation is performed. The measured value of m MC t = 172.33 \u00b1 0.14 (stat) +0.66   \u22120.72 (syst) GeV is in good agreement with previous measurements. The resulting cross section is used, together with the theoretical prediction, to determine the top quark mass and to extract a value of the strong coupling constant with different sets of parton distribution functions.",

At the CERN LHC, measurements with increasing precision have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in several different decay channels and at four pp collision energies [1][2][3][4][5]. Precise theoretical predictions of \u03c3 tt have been performed in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) [6][7][8][9]. The calculations depend on several fundamental parameters: the top quark mass m t , the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S , and the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The measurements of \u03c3 tt have G. Vesztergombi, A. C.

            "text": "The value of m t significantly affects the prediction for many observables, either directly or via radiative corrections. It is a key input to electroweak precision fits [18] and, together with the value of the Higgs boson mass and \u03b1 S , it has direct implications on the SM predictions for the stability of the electroweak vacuum [19]. In QCD calculations beyond leading order, m t depends on the renormalization scheme. In the context of the \u03c3 tt predictions, the pole (on-shell) definition for the top quark mass m pole t has wide applications; however, it suffers from the renormalon problem that introduces a theoretical ambiguity in its definition. The minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization scheme has been shown to have a faster convergence than other schemes [20]. The relation between the pole and MS masses is known to the four-loop level in QCD [21]. Experimentally, the most precise measurements of the top quark mass are obtained in so-called direct measurements performed at the Tevatron and LHC [22][23][24][25]. Except for a few cases such as Ref. [26], the measurements rely on Monte Carlo (MC) generators to provide the relation between the top quark mass and an experimental observable. Current MC generators implement matrix elements at leading or next-to-leading order (NLO), while higher orders are simulated through parton showering. Studies suggest that the top quark mass parameter m MC t , as implemented in current MC generators, corresponds to m pole t to an uncertainty on the order of 1 GeV [27,28]. A theoretically well-defined mass can be determined by comparing the measured tt cross section to the fixed-order theoretical predictions [1,4,[10][11][12].",

            "text": "With the exception of the quark masses, \u03b1 S is the only free parameter in the QCD Lagrangian. While the renormalization group equation predicts the energy dependence of \u03b1 S , i.e. it gives a functional form for \u03b1 S (Q), where Q is the energy scale of the process, actual values of \u03b1 S can only be obtained from experimental data. By convention and to facilitate comparisons, \u03b1 S values measured at different energy scales are typically evolved to Q = m Z , the mass of the Z boson. The current world-average value for \u03b1 S (m Z ) is 0.1181\u00b10.0011 [29]. In spite of this relatively precise result, the uncertainty in \u03b1 S still contributes significantly to many QCD predictions, including cross sections for top quark or Higgs boson production. Very few measurements allow \u03b1 S to be tested at high Q, and the precision on the world-average value for \u03b1 S (Q) is driven by low-Q measurements. A determination of \u03c3 tt was used by the CMS Collaboration to extract the value of \u03b1 S (m Z ) at NNLO for the first time [11]. In the prediction for \u03c3 tt , \u03b1 S appears not only in the expression for the parton-parton interaction but also in the QCD evolution of the PDFs. Varying the value of \u03b1 S (m Z ) in the \u03c3 tt calculation therefore requires a consistent modification of the PDFs. The full correlation between the gluon PDF, \u03b1 S , and m t in the prediction for \u03c3 tt has to be accounted for.",

The data set was recorded by CMS in 2016 at a centre-ofmass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The measurement is performed using a maximum-likelihood fit in which the sources of systematic uncertainty are treated as nuisance parameters. Distributions of observables are chosen as input to the fit so as to further constrain the uncertainties. The fitting procedure largely follows the approach of Ref. [4]. In this analysis, the number of events is significantly larger than in previous data sets, thus providing tighter constraints. The dominant uncertainties come from the integrated luminosity and the efficiency to identify the two leptons. The correlation between the three decay channels is used to constrain the overall lepton identification uncertainty to that of the better-constrained lepton, which is the muon.",

In contrast, the experimental dependence of \u03c3 tt on the value of \u03b1 S (m Z ) used in the simulation is negligible [11]. For the extraction of a theoretically well-defined m t , the dependence of the cross section on the assumption of a m MC t value can be reduced by including m MC t as an additional free parameter in the fit [30]. In this paper, the cross section \u03c3 tt is first measured for a fixed value of m MC t = 172.5 GeV, and then determined simultaneously with m MC t . In the simultaneous fit, input distributions sensitive to the top quark mass are introduced in order to constrain m MC t . For the measured parameter m MC t , the same systematic uncertainties are taken into account as in Ref. [31]. Finally, the measured value of \u03c3 tt at the experimentally constrained value of m MC t is used to extract \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m t in the MS scheme, using different PDF sets. For m t , the pole mass scheme is also considered.",

Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

The nuisance parameters displayed in this figure show similar trends to those in Fig. 7, described above.

In the MMHT14nnlo, CT14nnlo, and NNPDF3.1nnlo PDFs, the value of \u03b1 S (m Z ) is assumed to be 0.118. In ABMP16nnlo, \u03b1 S (m Z ) is fitted simultaneously with the PDFs. The ABMP16nnlo PDF employs the MS scheme for the heavy-quark mass treatment in its determination. Similar to the value of \u03b1 S (m Z ), the value of m t (m t ) in the ABMP16nnlo set is obtained in a simultaneous fit with the PDFs. For the other PDFs, the values of m pole t are assumed, as listed in Table 4.

Assuming a top quark mass in the simulation of m MC t = 172.5 GeV, a visible cross section is measured in the fiducial region using dilepton events (e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , e + e \u2212 ) and then extrapolated to the full phase space.
