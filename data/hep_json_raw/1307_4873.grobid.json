The major contributing channels are optimized for the main production modes, the associated production with a vector boson (V H, with V = W, Z), the vector boson fusion, and the gluon-gluon fusion, and the different decay modes H \u2192 bb, H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , H \u2192 W + W \u2212 , and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. A significant excess of events is observed in the mass range 115 < M H < 140 GeV. The local significance corresponds to 3.0 standard deviations at m H = 125 GeV, consistent with the mass of the new particle observed at the LHC. The observed signal strengths in all channels are consistent with the presence of a standard model Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV. We also present prospects for spin/parity tests to be performed in the V H \u2192 Vbb channels.",

This exclusion limit and those reported hereafter are all defined at the 95% C.L. After the end of searches at LEP, precision electroweak tests, including the W-boson mass mesurement from LEP, and the W-boson mass and top-quark mass measurements from the Tevatron Run I, contributed to constrain further the Higgs boson mass. In Summer 2002, the constraint from the electroweak fit read M H < 193 GeV [2]. This was greatly improved thanks to the top mass and W mass measurements using the first data of Tevatron Run II, so that in Winter 2007, the indirect constraint was M H < 144 GeV [3] which narrowed down substantially the expected mass range for the Higgs boson.",
