These goals are to be achieved by performing a two-dimensional phase diagram (T \u2212 \u03bc B ) scan -measurements of hadron production as a function of collision energy and system size. With its large acceptance and good particle identification NA61/SHINE also performs detailed and precise particle production measurements for the T2K, Pierre Auger Observatory and KASCADE-Grande experiments. This contribution summarizes current status and future plans as well as presents the first physics results of the NA61/SHINE experiment. \u00a71.

It measures hadron production in various collisions (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Ca, Xe+La) at various beam energies (13A, 20A, 30A, 40A, 80A and 158A GeV). 7) These new data, together with Pb+Pb reactions recorded by NA49 will allow to cover the region, where the critical point is expected (Fig. 1).

Also, comparison with the UrQMD model revealed discrepancies at low momenta and low azimuthal angles (Fig. 3). Taking into account the NA61/SHINE results, a patch has been released to correct the model. 14) The measurements of K + spectra from p+C interactions at 31A GeV have just been released. 15) First \u03c0 \u2212 results relevant to the study of the properties of the onset of deconfinement are presented in Fig. 4. The rapidity spectra from p+C interactions at 31A GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV are compared in Fig. 4 (left). The mean pion multiplicity in the forward hemisphere is approximately proportional to the mean number of wounded nucleons of the projectile nucleus. At the energy of  the onset of deconfinement (30A GeV) the mean pion multiplicity in central Pb+Pb collisions agrees with the Wounded Nucleon Model 16) predictions. An exponential function was fitted to the transverse mass spectra at mid-rapidity (0 < y < 0.2) in the range of 0.2 < m T \u2212 m \u03c0 < 0.7 GeV/c 2 . The fitted inverse slope parameter T is plotted in Fig. 4 (right) for p+C at 31A GeV (this analisis), 158A GeV, 17) and central Pb+Pb at 30A 10) and 158A GeV. 10) An increase is observed both when increasing the system size, and when the collision energy. In statistical models this behaviour can be interpreted as a temperature and radial flow increase. \u00a75. Summary NA61/SHINE has the potential to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and guarantees systematic data on the onset of deconfinement. The two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram is in progress. p+p interactions were already registered at all six energies. First Be+Be run took place in November 2011. Charged pion spectra have been used for computation of the T2K \u03bd \u03bc beam properties, as well as for improving the UrQMD model.",
