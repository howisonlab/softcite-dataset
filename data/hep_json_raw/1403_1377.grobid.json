A CP \u2192K\u03c0 is used to extract the strong phase difference \u03b4 K\u03c0 between the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed process D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and Cabibbo-favored D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + . By taking inputs of other parameters in world measurements, we obtain cos \u03b4 K\u03c0 = 1.03 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.01. This is the most accurate result of cos \u03b4 K\u03c0 to date and can improve the world constrains on the mixing parameters and on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 in the CKM matrix.",

The M BC distribution, shown in Figure 1, which has a peak at the mass of the D meson and a smooth background cut-off at the point of the beam energy, are fitted by a signal shape derived from MC simulation, convoluted with a smearing Gaussian function, and a background function modeled with the ARGUS function 7 .
