One such project is the development of a validation framework, which checks the compatibility of evolving computing environments and technologies with the experiments software for as long as possible, with the aim of substantially extending the lifetime of the analysis software, and hence of the usability of the data. The framework is designed to automatically test and validate the software and data of an experiment against changes and upgrades to the computing environment, as well as changes to the experiment software itself. Technically, this is realised using a framework capable of hosting a number of virtual machine images, built with different configurations of operating systems and the relevant software, including any necessary external dependencies.",

            "text": "The problem of data persistence and preservation is not new, but is becoming more prominent with the advent of so called big data, in particular within the applied sciences. However, until recently high energy physics (HEP) had little or no tradition or clear model of long-term preservation of data in a meaningful and useful way, and the data from the majority of older experiments have simply been lost. Attempts to preserve previous data sets have in general not been a planned initiative by the original collaboration but a push by knowledgeable people, usually at a later date. This is despite several clear scenarios where preservation of HEP data is beneficial for a number of reasons including: to allow the re-analysis of data taken at a unique centre of mass energy and/or with unique initial state particles, especially if new theoretical predictions or analysis techniques become available; to aid the combination of data sets between similar experiments; for verification of new phenomena found by another HEP experiment; and to allow the use of real HEP data in scientific training, education and outreach.",

            "text": "The start of the 21st century saw the end of operation of several particle colliders including LEP (e + e \u2212 , where data taking ended in 2000), HERA (e \u00b1 p, 2007), PEP-II (e + e \u2212 , 2008), KEKB (e + e \u2212 , 2010) and the Tevatron (pp, 2011), providing unique data sets in terms of initial state particles or centre of mass energy or both. As the experiments at each of these colliders continued to publish their final results and conclude their core physics programmes, the question of what should be done with the data naturally presented itself. Inspired by a lack of concrete solutions or guidelines to the problem of data preservation in HEP, an international study group on data preservation and long-term analysis in high-energy physics, DPHEP, was formed at the end of 2008 to address the issue in a systematic way. The composition of the group was initially driven by BaBar and the HERA experiments H1, ZEUS and HERMES, who were soon joined by Belle, BES-III and the Tevatron experiments CDF and D\u00d8. The LEP experiments are also represented in DPHEP and the LHC experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb joined the study group in 2011. The laboratories and associated computing centres at BNL, CERN, DESY, Fermilab, JLAB, KEK and SLAC are also all members of DPHEP, in addition to several funding agencies. A series of seven workshops have taken place since 2009 and DPHEP is officially endorsed with a mandate by the International Committee for Future Accelerators, ICFA.",

In addition to the data, the various software, such as simulation, reconstruction and analysis software need to be considered. If the experimental software is not available the possibility to study new observables or to incorporate new reconstruction algorithms, detector simulations or event generators is lost. Without a well defined and understood software environment the scientific potential of the data may be limited. Just as important are the various types of documentation, covering all facets of an experiment. Considering this inclusive definition of HEP data, the DPHEP Collaboration has established a series of data preservation levels, as summarised in table 1. The levels are organised in order of increasing benefit, which comes with increasing complexity and cost. Each level is associated with use cases, and the preservation model adopted by an experiment should reflect the level of analysis expected to be available in the future.",

Previous data preservation experiences in HEP indicate that new analyses and complete reanalyses are only possible if all the necessary ingredients to retrieve, reconstruct and understand the data are accounted for. Only with the full flexibility provided by a level 4 preservation model does the full potential of the data remain. Most experiments in DPHEP plan for a level 4 preservation programme, although different approaches are employed concerning how this goal should be achieved. One option, typically realised using virtualisation, is to freeze the current system to keep the software and environment alive as long as possible. Although this will provide a workable solution for the mediumterm future, the operability of the software and correctness of the results are not guaranteed. If changes are needed it will become more difficult the longer software is frozen and future compatibility issues may arise, in addition to the inevitable security concerns.",

In this way, the working version of the experimental software is actively migrated to more modern platforms and future-proof resources, substantially extending the lifetime of the software, and hence the data, whilst retaining the flexibility to apply any necessary changes. The success of such migrations depends on having a robust and complete set of validation tests. Virtualisation techniques are again used, in this case to provide a coherent platform to build and validate software and environments created according to the recipes provided by the experiments.",

Figure 2 details the results of this evaluation by the H1 Collaboration, which is implementing a full level 4 preservation programme, expected to comprise of up to 500 tests in total. The structure of the tests is divided into two parts. Firstly the compilation of approximately 100 individual H1 software packages and the identified external dependencies is carried out, where the resulting binaries are stored as tar-balls on the common storage within the sp-system. Secondly, a series of validation tests is performed on the full spectrum of the H1 software, using the compiled software. Whereas some of these tests examine the results of stand alone executables and are run in parallel, many are run sequentially and form discrete parts in one of several full analysis chains: from MC generation and simulation, through multi-level file production and ending with a full physics analysis and subsequent validation of the results.",

Current situation and opportunity for expansion A software preservation system has been developed at DESY, supporting a series of validation tests defined by the HERA experiments, to ensure that these unique data are available for analysis for the next 10 years or more. The process of defining and implementing the complete set of validation tests for the whole chain of software to be preserved is still ongoing and is expected to take another year. From the IT side, the current version of the sp-system is very light for the user tests implemented so far and the common storage allows communication between the sp-system and the experiment tests using only a few shell variables. These variables describe for example the location of the input file of the tests, the test outputs and the external software on the client. Using thin layers of scripts, a separation of the user part from the details of the sp-system is possible, allowing already existing user tests to be integrated into the sp-system or tests developed within the sp-system to be ported to other test platforms. By design the sp-system is expandable and able to host and validate the requirements of multiple experiments, and can be thought of as a tool to aid migration in order to detect problems and incoherence, as well as identifying and reporting the reasons behind them.",
