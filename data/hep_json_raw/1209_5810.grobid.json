This analysis, featuring a search for a sidereal time dependence of the events, is the first test of Lorentz invariance using a reactor-based antineutrino source. No sidereal variation is present in the data and the disappearance results are consistent with sidereal time independent oscillations. Under the Standard-Model Extension (SME), we set the first limits on fourteen Lorentz violating coefficients associated with transitions between electron and tau flavor, and set two competitive limits associated with transitions between electron and muon flavor.",

A path to more exotic physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) may be gained by carefully examining the oscillation behavior. In particular, the collected electron antineutrino sample also provides an opportunity to search for the violation of Lorentz invariance.",

The as-yet-unseen violation of this principle is predicted to occur at the Planck scale and is especially interesting as it can occur dynamically via spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking [3]. The process of neutrino oscillation, in which a neutrino of one flavor transforms into another flavor after traveling a distance, is due to interference between the slightly different Hamiltonian eigenstates of the propagating particle. The experimental observable, oscillation probability, is therefore quite sensitive to small couplings between neutrinos and a possible Lorentz violating field.",

We probe this field by searching for such a dependence among the collected electron antineutrino events. The antineutrino vector is set using the antineutrino source and the location of the detector.

The \"inner detector,\" composed of three concentric cylindrical regions separated by acrylic, is used to observe and efficiently reconstruct these events as well as mitigate background. The innermost 10 m 3 cylinder contains 1 g/l gadolinium-doped scintillator and forms the antineutrino target. Surrounding this is the \"gamma catcher,\" designed to detect gamma-rays escaping the target volume. The gamma catcher volume is then enveloped by a non-scintillating oil buffer in which 390 10 inch PMTs are immersed. The inner detector is surrounded by a steel vessel that forms an optically isolated outer cylinder filled with scintillator.

The data consist of 8249 IBD candidates, collected with 227.9 live days and 33.7 GWton-years exposure. There are 497 background events expected in this sample. The background is mainly composed of (1) cosmogenic radioisotopes, such as 8 He and 9 Li, which decay via the emission of \u03b2n, (2) cosmogenic stopping muons as well as fast neutrons that interact multiple times in the inner detector, and (3) accidental coincidence of a radioactivity-induced prompt signal followed by a neutron-like event. Background event rate as a function of sidereal time is treated as a constant. As the dominant background contributions to the Double Chooz analyses arise as the result of cosmic ray muons, we study the time dependence of muon veto rate in order to justify this assumption. The maximum variation in muon veto rate as a function of sidereal time is about 0.5%. A background variation in time at this level would create a maximum variation in disappearance probability of \u223c0.03%.",

The reactor flux and detector operations are both weak functions of solar time due to human activity as the cores turned on/off multiple times during the run and detector calibrations are generally done during the daylight hours. Day-night effects are well accounted for in the MC prediction. All uncertainties are included in a covariance matrix, fully describing the predicted statistical and systematic errors. The 3.93 minute/day difference between sidereal and solar time, compounded over the \u223c1 year physics run, largely removes any potential for an unaccounted modulation in sidereal time associated with small modulations related to solar dependence. The detector and background prediction uncertainties are considered uncorrelated with each other and fully correlated in sidereal time. A thorough explanation of the various uncertainties and their determination can be found in Ref. [2], noting that correlations in time (as opposed to antineutrino energy in the reference) are most important here. The total fractional uncertainty with respect to the MC expectation is 2.9%. The statistical uncertainty contributes at the level of 1.1% and systematic uncertainties are led by the reactor flux and detector response (1.7%) and the background prediction (1.7%).",

The BF results for both fits are dominated by the sidereal time independent terms, (C)\u0113\u03c4 and (C)\u0113\u03bc. We examine the significance of the results below. The flatness of the sidereal time distribution is analyzed using a frequentist approach. A large sample of randomized pseudoexperiments, based on the MC expectation and the total error matrix and with an injected sidereal time independent (\"flat\") disappearance, is generated in order to determine the fraction of samples that present a more or less flat solution than the one found here. We introduce a normalization factor of 91.8%, consistent with the counting-only disappearance probability, in order to ensure that we are testing the null hypothesis that there is no sidereal time dependence rather than the null hypothesis that there is no antineutrino disappearance. The \u2206\u03c7 2 is defined as the minimum \u03c7 2 from the flat hypothesis minus the minimum \u03c7 2 from each e \u2212 \u03c4 or e\u2212\u00b5 fit. This frequentist study shows that 60.0% (41.8%) of pseudoexperiments have a larger \u2206\u03c7 2 than the real data and that the e \u2212 \u03c4 (e \u2212 \u00b5) results are consistent with sidereal time independent oscillations. In the absence of a sidereal dependence, we proceed to set limits on the relevant time dependent SME coefficients. Limits on the SME coefficients and allowed regions around the BF parameters are determined by constructing a five and three dimensional parameter space, corresponding to the e \u2212 \u03c4 and e \u2212 \u00b5 fits, respectively. By assuming the minimum of the least squares fit estimator follows a \u03c7 2 distribution, a 68% CL (95% CL) hyper-volume can be defined as the region enclosed by the constant \u03c7 2 hyper-surface with minimum \u03c7 2 plus 5.9 (11.3) for the e \u2212 \u03c4 fit, and 3.5 (8.0) for the e \u2212 \u00b5 fit.

That is, each pseudoexperiment sample is convolved with the BF oscillation probability equation. A new fit is then performed and the BF parameters are tallied. We find that the above choices for",
