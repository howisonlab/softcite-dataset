            "text": "Forward-backward correlation strength (b) as a function of pesudorapidity intervals for experimental data from p+p non-singly diffractive collisions are compared to PYTHIA and PHOJET model calculations. The correlations are discussed as a function of rapidity window (\u2206\u03b7) symmetric about the central rapidity as well as rapidity window separated by a gap (\u03b7gap) between forward and backward regions. While the correlations are observed to be independent of \u2206\u03b7, it is found to decrease with increase in \u03b7gap. This reflects the role of short range correlations and justifies the use of \u03b7gap to obtain the accurate information about the physics of interest, the long range correlations. The correlation strength from PYTHIA are in agreement with the available experimental data while those from the PHOJET give higher values. For p+p collisions at \u221a s = 7, 10 and 14 TeV, the correlation strength from PHOJET are lower compared to those from PYTHIA, this is in contrast to the observations at lower energies. The experimental b value shows a linear dependence on ln \u221a s with the maximum value of unity being reached at \u221a s = 16 TeV, beyond the top LHC energy. However calculations from the PYTHIA and PHOJET models indicate a deviation from linear dependence on ln \u221a s and saturation in the b values being reached beyond \u221a s = 1.8 TeV. Such a saturation in correlation values could have interesting physical interpretations related to clan structures in particle production. Strong forward-backward correlations are associated with cluster production in the collisions. The average number of charged particles to which the clusters fragments, called the cluster size, are found to also increase linearly with ln \u221a s for both data and the models studied. The rate of increase in cluster size vs. ln \u221a s from models studied are larger compared to those from the data and higher for PHOJET compared to PYTHIA. Our study indicates that the forward-backward measurements",

            "text": "Understanding the mechanism of particle production in p+p collisions is one of the first goals of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Several new results from the LHC experiments in terms of particle multiplicities at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.36, 2.76 and 7 TeV are being compared to various models of particle production 2,3,4,5,6,7 . The most popular models for comparison to data from p+p collisions being PYTHIA 8,9,10,11 and PHOJET 12,13 . The PHOJET model combines the ideas based on a dual parton model (DPM) 14,15 on soft process of particle production and uses lowest-order perturbative QCD for hard process. Regge phenomenology is used to parameterize the total, elastic and inelastic cross-sections. The initial and final state parton shower are generated in leading log-approximation. PYTHIA on the other hand uses string fragmentation as a process of hadronization and tends to use the perturbative parton-parton scattering for low to high p T particle production. Initial results have shown that both models do not have perfect agreement with multiplicity measurements at LHC energies studied so far 2,3,4,5,6,7 . However it may be mentioned that several of these models in turn are used to obtain various correction factors for the experimental measurements. In this paper we suggest that the correlations between the particles produced in forward and backward rapidities can be used to discriminate between the various models of particle production, more reliably at the LHC energies.",

            "text": "The forward-backward correlations previously observed had several physical interpretations. The correlations over small range in rapidity are believed to be dominated by short-range correlations as due to resonance decays, those occurring over large rapidity range could be interpreted to be due to multiple parton interactions. In early 1985, a statistical interpretation of the forward-backward correlations observed in ISR energies was provided 16 . The interpretation was based on clusters being produced in these hadronic collisions according to a negative binomial distribution and the final hadrons are a result of the decay of these clusters. An extended version of such a statistical scenario can be found in Ref. 17 . A more dynamical interpretation was provided based on the DPM as in Ref. 18 . The experimental data was also interpreted in terms of a model based on a unitarized model which included soft and semi-hard components (minijets). In such a model the average number of particles produced was proportional to the effective number of inelastic collisions. The increase of forward-backward correlations with \u221a s was fully generated by the superposition of the different impact parameter contributions to the inelastic cross section 19 . The extension of this interesting idea is to consider a weighted superposition of two classes of events in hadronic collisions: soft and semi-hard processes.",

Such a formulation is found to give a fairly good description of data from STAR Collaboration in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV 21 . Studies of forward-backward correlations provide baseline measurements to look for long range rapidity correlation in heavy-ion collisions. STAR experiment has recently made this relative (comparison between p+p and different collision centrality Au+Au collisions at the center of mass energies of 200 GeV) measurements to claim the existence of a large long range correlation in central Au+Au collisions 22 . Although the experimental data cannot differentiate whether the actual underlying mechanism is due to those in a dual parton model 14,15 DPM or a Color Glass Condensate 23,24 , both however require that the long range correlations are produced by multiple parton-parton interactions. Further it is argued that the clustering of color sources could lead to forward-backward correlations 25 .

            "text": "Most of the existing forward-backward correlation results at high energies are from p+p collisions. The current work presents the predictions of the correlation co-efficient from PYHTIA and PHOJET models in p+p collisions at LHC energies and compares them to extrapolations of results from p+p collisions. So it is essential to check using models if a difference is expected in correlation values between p+p and p+p collisions at a given \u221a s. Note however that the STAR Collaboration has measured the strength of charged particle forward-backward multiplicity correlation, b in p+p collision at \u221a s = 200 GeV 28 . It is about 3 -4 times smaller than the one measured by UA5 in p+p collision at the same energy apparently 27 . The eta gap in STAR is 0.2 where as in UA5 it is 0.5. Also both the experimental  acceptances are different. STAR has | \u03b7 | < 1.0 where as UA5 has | \u03b7 | < 4. Fig. 2 shows the correlation co-efficient (b) calculated using non-singly diffractive events from PYTHIA model at \u221a s = 900 GeV as a function of \u2206\u03b7 for p+p and p+p collisions. No appreciable difference is observed between the two colliding systems for correlations studied as a function of \u2206\u03b7 and \u03b7 gap . Also shown for comparison are the charged particle correlation co-efficient results from UA5 experiment. Usually due to experimental limitations the analysis is carried out with a lower p T cut off. As seen in Fig. 2 a typical experimental cut-off of 100 MeV on p T does not seem to change the correlation values as a function of \u2206\u03b7 and \u03b7 gap . We have also investigated the effect of weak decay particle contributions to this analysis. The difference between weak decay on and weak decay off for p+p collisions is noticeable for smaller \u2206\u03b7 and the difference vanishes as we go to larger \u2206\u03b7. This is along expected lines, as decay effect will introduce short-range correlations. The effect of finite charged particle detection efficiency has been studied by varying it between 86% to 94%, no appericiable change is observed. The effect of a different tuned version of PYTHIA (D6T) has also been investigated. This also does not seem to affect the observed correlations by a large amount. The bottom panel of the figure shows the ratio of the correlation from simulation with various effects to the correlation measured by UA5 experiment. One observes that for the study with respect to \u2206\u03b7 the variations lie within 20%. For the study with respect to the \u03b7 gap , the ratio is close to unity upto a value of \u03b7 gap 4 units, then the simulation starts to diverge away from the measurements. The following observations can be made: (a) The correlation strength both in experimental data and simulations are observed to be almost independent of \u2206\u03b7, (b) correlations seem to increase with \u221a s, and (c) PYTHIA model calculations agrees well with the experimental data, while PHOJET tends to give higher correlations for all the measured \u221a s. This can be seen from the ratio of the correlation value from model to data in the bottom panel of the Fig. 3. As the larger \u2206\u03b7 includes contribution from smaller \u2206\u03b7 intervals, such a data may not provide accurate information about long range correlations. These correlations could include significant short-range correlations.   seen from the ratio of correlations from models to that from data as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The agreement with the highest energy data by both the models poses the question whether at LHC energies the current measurements will have the distinguishing power. To investigate this possibility, we now discuss the predictions at three LHC energies of \u221a s = 7, 10 and 14 TeV from PYTHIA and PHOJET models.   and 14 TeV p+p collisions, similar to the trend seen at lower energies p+p collisions. Although PYTHIA tends to predict a slightly increasing trend at larger \u2206\u03b7. Both models also predict a decreasing trend of b as a function of \u03b7 gap at \u221a s = 7, 10 and 14 TeV as was observed for lower energies. The decrease in b with respect to \u03b7 gap from PYTHIA is slower compared to that from PHOJET at 7, 10 and 14 TeV. Both models clearly suggest that the correlation strength should saturate at higher energies, with PHOJET indicating that saturation could occur as early as \u221a s = 1.8 TeV.",

However for top LHC energies of \u221a s = 7, 10, 14 TeV, the correlation strength from PHOJET is lower compared to PYTHIA, suggesting a transition at an intermediate energy accessible at LHC. The measured correlation strength are found to increase linearly with ln \u221a s and extrapolation suggests it will reach unity (maximum value) around \u221a s = 20 TeV, beyond the beam energy reach at LHC. However model calculations suggest the correlation values tends to saturate starting at \u221a s = 2 TeV.
