Overall the uncertainties on the CKM matrix elements are dominating the theoretical error budget [1].

            "text": "The full schematic of the detector can be seen in Fig. 1, and a detailed description of the experimental set-up can be found in [12]. A differential Cherenkov counter (KTAG) identifies kaons in the beam line with a time resolution of \u223c100 ps, which is matched to downstream activity to reject beam induced background. It is followed by the beam spectrometer (GTK) measuring the kaon momentum. Immediately following the decay volume, a straw spectrometer (STRAW) measures the downstream tracks momentum. A Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) provides particle identification for \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u00b5 \u00b1 , e \u00b1 in the momentum range 15 GeV/c-35 GeV/c. These measurements allow to build the squared missing mass variable m 2 miss \u2261 (p K \u2212 p \u03c0 ) 2 , where p K and p \u03c0 are the 4-momenta of the beam and downstream tracks under the kaon and pion hypothesis, respectively. This variable is used to discriminate between the signal and background kinematics, allowing a 10 4 rejection factor. Finally a set of highly efficient veto for muons, photons and inelastic interaction provide an almost hermetic coverage reaching a 10 7 suppression factor. The events are reconstructed according to the signal signature described above: a single track topology is selected by spatially matching a reconstructed track in the STRAW with signals in the CHOD and RICH detectors. A K + identified in the KTAG detector and traced in the GTK is matched in time with the upstream track. The kaon decay vertex is built at the intersection of the two tracks and is required to be in a 50 m long region starting 10 m downstream of the last GTK station. The \u03c0 + identification is performed using in combination the RICH and the calorimeters, providing a total muon rejection of 10 \u22128 for a \u03c0 + efficiency of 64 %, measured on independent samples of kinematically selected K \u03c0\u03c0 and K \u00b5\u03bd . The remaining background is principally K \u03c0\u03c0 decays, which are further suppressed using the electromagnetic calorimeters (LKr, SAC, IRC, LAVs). Events with extra energy deposits in-time with the \u03c0 + track are rejected, providing a \u03c0 0 suppression of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 . The signal region defined in the m 2 miss variable is driven by its resolution (10 \u22123 GeV 2 /c 4 ) and is divided into two sub-regions (R1 and R2) below and above the K \u03c0\u03c0 peak respectively. The 4-momenta used in the squared missing mass computation can be reconstructed using different methods: using STRAW or RICH for p \u03c0 , and using GTK or the nominal beam parameters for p K . Imposing constraints on m 2 miss reconstructed using various combinations of these methods protects against mis-reconstruction of the momenta. A sample selected using calorimeters only is used to measure the kinematic suppression factors, which is 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for K \u03c0\u03c0 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for K \u00b5\u03bd . The expectations for the final background contamination are verified in control regions on the side of the signal regions R1 and R2 for K \u03c0\u03c0(\u03b3) and K \u00b5\u03bd , or estimated from MC for K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd (K e4 ). The final acceptance for the signal, extracted from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, is 1 % (3 %) in R1 (R2), for a total acceptance of A \u03c0\u03bd\u03bd = 4 %.",

The first phase of the experiment aims at observing a K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd signal, before increasing the sensitivity and moving to the second phase with a measurement of B(K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) from about 100 events. A secondary K L beam with 1.4 GeV/c peak energy is used by the experiment. The neutral kaons are allowed to decay in a 3 m long fiducial region evacuated at 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 bar.",

By assuming the two \u03b3 come from a neutral pion, the longitudinal vertex position Z vtx and the \u03c0 0 missing transverse momentum P t can be computed and define the signal region. The fiducial volume is further surrounded by veto systems to reject events with additional particles. ",

The upper limit set on the branching fraction is B(K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) < 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 (90% C.L.) . The main background sources are K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays and halo neutrons interactions with the detector. Dedicated runs with an aluminium target have been performed to improve the discrimination between neutron and photon clusters in the CsI calorimeter. This resulted in a factor 5 improvement on the reduction of neutron induced background. Other improvements on the experimental system further reduce the impact of neutron interactions. Finally the installation of a new beam pipe charged veto allowed to reduce the acceptance loss by 40 %.",

Their branching ratios are both currently known to a very good precision in the SM, with uncertainties mostly arising from the precision on the CKM matrix elements. The analysis performed at the NA62 experiment reports one observed event with 0.27 expected SM signal event and 0.15 background events. This result validates the chosen decay-in-flight technique and allows to set a limit at 90 % C.L. of B(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) < 10 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . The KOTO experiment published a result which sets the limit B(K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) < 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90 % C.L. for the neutral channel.
