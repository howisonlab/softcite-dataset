The Born cross sections of these two processes are measured at each center-of-mass energy. The measured energy-dependent Born cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 shows an enhancement around 4.2 GeV. The measurement is compatible with an earlier measurement by Belle.",

            "text": "During the last decade, new charmoniumlike vector states, such as the Y (4260), Y (4360) and Y (4660), have been observed by BABAR [1,2], Belle [3][4][5][6] and CLEO [7]. The masses of these new Y states are above the DD production threshold, ranging from 4.0 to 4.7 GeV/c 2 . Since all of them are produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation (either directly or via the initial state radiation (ISR) process), and since they have been observed to decay in dipion hadronic transitions to the J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(3686), one would naturally interpret these states as vector charmonium excitations. However, peculiar features of these Y states reveal an exotic nature that likely excludes a conventional charmonium interpretation. These features include a discrepancy with the spectrum of vector charmonium states predicted by the potential model given in reference [8], a surprisingly large coupling to final states without open-charm mesons [9,10], and a lack of observation in the inclusive hadronic cross section [11]. Also, very recently, several charged charmoniumlike statesthe Z c (3900) \u00b1 [4,12,13], Z c (3885) \u00b1 [14], Z c (4020) \u00b1 [15], Z c (4025) \u00b1 [16], as well as their isospin partners, the neutral states Z c (3900) 0 [13] and Z c (4020) 0 [17] -were observed in the same mass region as these Y states. This suggests that the nature of the Y states could be related to that of the Z c states. Moreover, the observed cross sections as a function of center-of-mass (CM) energy for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [1,3,4,7], \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) [2,5,6], \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [15], \u03b7J/\u03c8 [18] and \u03c9\u03c7 c0 [19] are inconsistent with each other. These observations hint at the existence of a more complicated and mysterious underlying dynamics.",

The chi-square of the kinematic fit, \u03c7 2 4C , is required to be less than 40. If there are more than two photons in an event, the combination of \u03b3\u03b3\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 with the least \u03c7 2 4C is chosen. To suppress the backgrounds from radiative Bhabha and radiative dimuon events associated with a random photon candidate, the energy of each selected photon is further required to be larger than 80 MeV. Figure 1 depicts scatter plots of the invariant mass of lepton pairs, M (\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ), versus that of two photons, M (\u03b3\u03b3), for data taken at \u221a s = 4.230 and 4.260 GeV. A clear accumulation of events is observed around the intersection of the \u03b7 and J/\u03c8 mass regions, which indicates e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 signals. There is no significant signal observed around the intersection of the \u03c0 0 and J/\u03c8 mass regions. MC studies show that dominant backgrounds are from the radiative Bhabha and dimuon events, and are expected to be distributed uniformly around the J/\u03c8 and \u03b7/\u03c0 0 mass regions. A significantly larger background yield is observed in the e + e \u2212 mode than in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode, which is due to the much larger Bhabha scattering cross section compared with the dimuon cross section. MC simulations show that the resolution of the invariant mass distributions of lepton pairs is about 10.7 MeV/c 2 for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode and 11.5 MeV/c 2 for the e + e \u2212 mode.

The following three aspects are considered when evaluating the systematic uncertainty associated with the fit procedure. (1) Fitting range: In TABLE IV. Summary of systematic uncertainties (%) in the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 for energies with significant signal in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (e + e \u2212 ) mode.

An alternative fit with a different fit range, from 0.25 to 0.85 GeV/c 2 , is performed. The differences in the yield are treated as the systematic uncertainty from the fit range. (2) Signal shape: In the fit, the signal shape is described by a shape obtained from a MC simulation convoluted with a Gaussian function.

The difference in the yield with respect to the nominal fit is considered as the systematic uncertainty from the signal shape. (3) Background shape: In the fit, background shapes are described as a second-order polynomial function. The fit with a third-order polynomial function for the background shape is used to estimate its uncertainty. For the data sets where no evident \u03b7 signal is found, the frequentist method is employed to determine upper limits on the Born cross section, and the numbers of signal and background events are obtained by counting the entries in signal and sideband regions. Two different sideband regions, either the \u03b7 sideband region or the J/\u03c8 sideband region, are used to estimate the uncertainty from the background shape.

            "text": "In summary, using data samples collected with the BE-SIII detector at 17 energies from 3.810 to 4.600 GeV, we performed an analysis of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8. Statistically significant \u03b7 signals are observed at \u221a s = 4.190, 4210, 4220, 4230, 4245, 4260, 4360 and 4420 GeV, and the corresponding Born cross sections are measured. In addition, we searched for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8. No significant signals are observed and the upper limits at the 90% C.L. on the Born cross section are set. A comparison of the Born cross sections \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8) in this measurement to that of previous results [18,26] is shown in Fig. 4, and a very good agreement is achieved. The measured Born cross sections are also compared to that of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 obtained from Belle [4]. Different lineshapes are observed in these two processes, which indicate that the production mechanism of the \u03b7J/\u03c8 clearly differs from that of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 in the vicinity of \u221a s = 4.1-4.6 GeV. This could indicate the existence of a rich spectrum of Y states in this energy region with different coupling strengths to the various e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 to that of previous measurements [18,26]. The blue dots are results from Belle, the black star dot is from BESIII(2012) and the red square dots are the results obtained in this work. The errors of the Belle data only include the statistical uncertainty. For the previously published BESIII results and our data, the errors reflect both statistical and systematical uncertainties.",
