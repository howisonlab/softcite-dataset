The selected events are accepted if they pass a set of kinematic cuts chosen to enhance the signalto-background ratio. The invariant mass distribution of the two jets (m jj ), representing the candidate decay products of the hadronically decaying boson, is obtained from all the selected events. The W W + W Z signal yield (N W V ) is obtained by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the m jj distribution using templates based on MC simulations. The fit is performed on events in an m jj range much larger than the range where the signal peaks, allowing the nearly signal-free m jj regions to constrain the rate of the W + jets events, which are the largest background. Because of the finite dijet mass resolution, there is considerable overlap between the m jj peaks from W W \u2192 \u03bdqq and W Z \u2192 \u03bdqq decays. Given the expected uncertainties in this measurement, and the relatively small contribution from the W Z process (about 20% of the total signal yield), no attempt is made to distinguish between the W W and W Z contributions in this analysis. Instead, the signal yield is obtained under the assumption that the ratio of the W W and W Z cross sections is equal to the SM prediction.",

Various assumptions can be made to decrease the number of free parameters. In this analysis, limits are given using the so-called LEP scenario [59] in which the following additional constraints, derived from SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge invariance, are imposed:  Figure 4.

The effect of an aTGC of \u03bb Z = \u03bb \u03b3 = 0.05 is shown for comparison (white histogram) on top of the SM predictions (coloured histograms). The rightmost bin includes overflow. The bottom panels show the ratio between the data and the SM prediction overlaid with the systematic uncertainty on the shape of the p Tjj distribution. The binning in the plots is the same as that one used to perform the calculation of the limits.

Then the probability of observing such a small likelihood ratio is determined through pseudo-experiments, in which pseudo-data are generated by randomly sampling the probability density function. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated in the fit via nuisance parameters which affect the rates and p Tjj distribution shapes of the signal and background processes. The same sources of systematic uncertainty are included as are described for the m jj fit in section 9, except for those found to be negligible, such as the effect of PDF uncertainties on the signal. In addition, an uncertainty is included on the p Tjj distribution shape of the signal due to increasing and decreasing the scales by a factor of two. The factorisation and renormalisation scales are varied simultaneously by the same amount. As can be seen in figure 4, at very high p Tjj the statistical uncertainties dominate, whereas at lower values of p Tjj the systematic uncertainties are more important.",

All limits are given at 95% CL, and calculated within the LEP scenario. The form factor \u039b FF used for each limit calculation is specified on the figure 5; \u039b FF = \u221e is equivalent to no form factor. The limits for each parameter are obtained while fixing the other two parameters to zero. In the CMS \u03bdjj analysis and the in ATLAS and CMS W \u03b3 analyses, no limits on \u2206g Z 1 were given. The ATLAS W W and W Z analyses gave limits on \u2206g Z 1 , but with \u2206\u03ba Z = 0 rather than \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 = 0, so they are not comparable with these results and are thus excluded. For the ATLAS W W result, the published limits on \u2206\u03ba Z are converted to limits on \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 using the formula \u2206\u03ba Z = \u2212\u2206\u03ba \u03b3 tan 2 \u03b8 w . The ATLAS W Z analysis published limits on \u2206\u03ba Z , which can also be converted to \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 , but those limits are not shown, since they are much larger than the other limits in this figure. The limits obtained in this analysis are competitive with the limits from the other analyses. Compared to the fully leptonic W W analyses from hadron colliders, the limits shown here are slightly more stringent for \u03bb and \u2206g Z 1 and slightly worse for \u2206\u03ba \u03b3 . In table 4, the limits are shown for each of the five aTGC parameters when no relationship between the different parameters is imposed. In this scenario, \u2206g Z 1 has very little effect on the W W process, whereas \u2206\u03ba Z has very little effect on the W Z process.  Thus, analyses that restrict themselves to either the W W process or the W Z process have limited sensitivity to at least one of the aTGC parameters. In contrast, this analysis combines the two processes, and therefore has good sensitivity to all five aTGC parameters. As an illustration, this analysis has four times better expected limits on \u2206g Z 1 than the ATLAS W W \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd analysis [3], and four times better expected limits on \u2206\u03ba Z than the ATLAS W Z \u2192 \u03bd analysis [4].",
