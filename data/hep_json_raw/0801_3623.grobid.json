The instantaneous luminosity at D\u00d8 is measured by counting the number of inelastic collisions that produce charged particles within the acceptance of the luminosity monitor [2]. The determination of the luminosity has recently been improved through studies of the multiplicities observed in the luminosity monitor [3]. These studies indicated that the fraction of observable inelastic collisions was overestimated in our previous analysis [4]. For this analysis the estimated integrated luminosity increased from 226 pb \u22121 to 257 pb \u22121 and the luminosity uncertainty decreased from 6.5% to 6.1%. The corrected value for \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z)\u2022Br(Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) is 209 \u00b1 13(stat.) \u00b1 16(syst.) \u00b1 13(lum.) pb. The new value is in reasonable agreement with the NNLO standard model predictions of 252 +5",
