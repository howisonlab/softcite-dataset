            "text": "A search for Higgs boson production in association with a W or Z boson, in the H\u2192 W W * decay channel, is performed with a data sample collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb \u22121 and 20.3 fb \u22121 , respectively. The W H production mode is studied in two-lepton and three-lepton final states, while twolepton and four-lepton final states are used to search for the ZH production mode. The observed significance, for the combined W H and ZH production, is 2.5 standard deviations while a significance of 0.9 standard deviations is expected in the Standard Model Higgs boson hypothesis. The ratio of the combined W H and ZH signal yield to the Standard Model expectation, \u00b5 V H , is found to be \u00b5 V H = 3.0 +1.3   \u22121.1 (stat.) +1.0 \u22120.7 (sys.) for the Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV. The W H and ZH production modes are also combined with the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes studied in the H \u2192 W W * \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd decay channel, resulting in an overall observed significance of 6.5 standard deviations and \u00b5 ggF+VBF+VH = 1.16 +0.16   \u22120.15 (stat.) +0.18 \u22120.15 (sys.). The results are interpreted in terms of scaling factors of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons (\u03ba V ) and fermions (\u03ba F ); the combined results are: |\u03ba V | = 1.06 +0.10   \u22120.10 , |\u03ba F | = 0.85 +0.26 \u22120.20 .",

            "text": "In the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions, the Brout-Englert-Higgs [1][2][3] mechanism induces the electroweak symmetry breaking that provides mass to elementary particles. The mechanism postulates the existence of an elementary scalar particle, the Higgs boson. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have observed the Higgs boson with a mass (m H ) of about 125 GeV [4,5]. The measurements of the Higgs boson couplings to SM particles, and its spin and CP quantum numbers, are essential tests of the SM [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Higgs boson production in association with a W or Z (weak) boson, which are respectively denoted by W H and ZH, and collectively referred to as V H associated production in the following, provides direct access to the Higgs boson couplings to weak bosons. In particular, in the W H mode with subsequent H\u2192 W W * decay, the Higgs boson couples only to W bosons, at both the production and decay vertices. Searches for V H production have been performed at both the Tevatron and LHC colliders, in events with leptons, b-jets and either missing transverse momentum or two central jets. Evidence for V H production has been recently reported in the Tevatron combination [13] while no V H production has been observed so far at the LHC [14][15][16][17][18][19][20].",

The data were collected in 2011 and 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively. In the SM, for m H = 125 GeV, the cross sections of the W H and ZH associated production modes, followed by the H\u2192 W W * decay, are 0.12 pb and 0.07 pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 0.15 pb and 0.09 pb at \u221a s = 8 TeV [21], respectively. Four topologies are considered, with two, three or four charged leptons in the final state (only electrons or muons are considered). The analyses are optimised to search for both the W H and ZH production modes; a combined result for V H is also presented. The V H results are then further combined with the H\u2192 W W * \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd analysis of gluon fusion (ggF) and vector boson fusion (VBF) production, for which the ATLAS Collaboration has reported the observation of the Higgs boson in the H\u2192 W W * decay channel with a significance of 6.1 standard deviations [22].",

To maximise the analysis sensitivity to the V H(H\u2192 W W * ) process in each of these decay modes, the data samples for each topology, except for the opposite-sign 2 channel, are further subdivided into several signal regions (SRs). Additional kinematic regions, with orthogonal selection criteria, designated as control regions (CRs), are used to normalise the major backgrounds in each SR by extracting normalisation factors. The final results are extracted from a fit that simultaneously considers all SRs and CRs. The 4 channel is split into two samples according to the number of same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs, namely 4 -2SFOS and 4 -1SFOS. The sample containing two SFOS pairs suffers from a higher background contamination than the sample with one SFOS pair. The 3 analysis requires at least one opposite-charge lepton pair, therefore the 3 system must have total charge of \u00b11. This analysis separates events with three sameflavour (SF) leptons, one SFOS lepton pair and zero SFOS lepton pairs, which have different signal-to-background ratios. For the 3 -3SF and 3 -1SFOS channels a multivariate analysis",

The isolation criteria are chosen to maximise the sensitivity to the V H(H\u2192 W W * ) process at m H = 125 GeV. The track-based isolation is built on the computation of the scalar sum of the p T of tracks associated with the primary vertex and inside a cone, constructed around the candidate lepton, of size \u2206R = 0.2 2 and excluding the track of the candidate lepton. The calorimeter-based isolation uses the scalar sum of the transverse energies measured within a cone of \u2206R = 0.2, excluding the energy of the calorimeter cluster associated with the lepton itself. For the 8 TeV data the electron calorimeter-based isolation algorithm uses topological clusters [62], while for the 7 TeV data it uses calorimeter cells. Cell-based isolation is used for muons in the calorimeter in both the 8 TeV and 7 TeV analyses. The calorimeter and track isolation criteria differ between the 8 TeV and 7 TeV data samples and are not the same for all the channels. The upper bound of the calorimeter-based isolation energy varies from 7% to 30% of the lepton p T , while the sum of the p T of the tracks in the cone is required to be smaller than 4% to 12% of the lepton p T , where tighter cuts are applied at low p T . Less stringent isolation criteria on energy and p T are required for the 7 TeV data sample, due to the lower level of pile-up compared to the 8 TeV data sample.",

The former, which benefits from the large rapidity coverage of the calorimeter and its sensitivity to neutral particles, is referenced as E miss T [68].

The quantity E miss T is calculated as the negative vector sum of the momenta of muons, electrons, \u03c4 leptons, photons, jets and clusters of calorimeter cells that are not associated with these objects (the \"soft term\"). In the 8 TeV analysis, to suppress the pile-up effect, the ratio of the scalar p T sum of all soft term tracks associated with the primary vertex to the scalar p T sum of all soft term tracks from all vertices is employed. This ratio is used to scale all soft-event contributions to E miss T [69]. The track-based missing transverse momentum measurement is used to reduce the effects of pile-up on the resolution of the calorimeterbased variant [70]. It is calculated as the vector sum of the transverse momenta of tracks with p T > 500 MeV that originate from the primary vertex. This quantity is called p miss T , and the analysis selections are applied to its magnitude, p miss T . In order to include neutral components in the calculation of p miss T in final states with jets, the sum of track momenta in jets is replaced by their energy measured in the calorimeter.",

The different uncertainty sources are treated according to their correlations across the data taking periods, among different analyses, between signal and background sources. Whenever an effect is expected to affect coherently the event yields in two event samples (SRs and/or CRs), for instance the muon reconstruction efficiency for both signal and background, a 100% correlation is assumed and the yields are varied coherently in the fit through the introduction of a single parameter (nuisance parameter). Alternatively when an uncertainty source is not expected to affect the event yields coherently, for instance trigger and luminosity uncertainties across different data taking years, different nuisance parameters are introduced to represent uncorrelated effects.",

Section 8.4 reports the significance for W H, ZH and combined V H production, moreover it shows the measurement of their cross sections divided by their SM expectations (\u00b5).

In the 2 -DFOS and 2 -SS1jet categories the numbers of observed events are slightly larger than the expectation. The lepton flavour composition of the events in the 2 -SS channel is shown in table 12, in which the high event yield of the 2 -SS1jet SR mainly originates from the \u00b5\u00b5 and \u00b5e channels. The behaviour of the observed data yield as a function of the data period was studied. The events were uniformly distributed according to the acquired luminosity as expected, excluding temporary failures of the detector subsystems as an explanation of the excess. Moreover it was checked that known detector defects were not increasing the rate of particular background sources. Finally, the kinematic distributions of the events were analysed in order to look for striking features pointing to some particular missing background contribution. Because no particular problem was found, the data excesses were attributed to statistical fluctuations.    Figure 7.

Only the relative sign between \u03ba V and \u03ba F is observable and hence in the following only \u03ba V > 0 is considered, without loss of generality. Sensitivity to the sign results from negative interference, in the gg \u2192 ZH process, between the box diagram in which both the Z and H bosons are produced directly from the heavy-quark loop and the triangle diagram in which only the Z * is produced and subsequently radiates a Higgs boson [81].

The product \u03c3(gg \u2192 H) \u2022 Br(H\u2192 W W * ), which is measured with good accuracy, does not depend on |\u03ba F | in the limit |\u03ba F | \u03ba V .

On the other hand \u00b5 VBF and \u00b5 V H , as measured for the H\u2192 W W * decay, should vanish in the limit |\u03ba F | \u03ba V due to the increased value of the Higgs boson total width and the consequent reduction of the H\u2192 W W * branching fraction. The observation of significant excesses in the VBF and V H production modes therefore leads to an exclusion of the |\u03ba F | \u03ba V region.

Associated W H production is studied in the final states in which the three W bosons decay to leptons or where one W boson decays to hadrons while the others decay leptonically. The two-lepton and four-lepton final states are used to search for ZH production. The dataset corresponds to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb \u22121 and 20.3 fb \u22121 recorded by the ATLAS experiment with LHC proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively. For the Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV, the observed (expected) deviation from the background-only hypothesis, which includes the Standard Model expectation for H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , corresponds to a significance of 2.5 (0.9) standard deviations. The ratio of the measured signal yield to its Standard Model expectation for the V H production is found to be \u00b5 VH = 3.0 +1.3 \u22121.1 (stat.) +1.0 \u22120.7 (sys.). A combination with the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion analyses using the H \u2192 W W * \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd decay is also presented. Including V H production the observed significance for a Higgs boson decaying to W W * is 6.5 \u03c3 with an expectation of 5.9 \u03c3 for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass JHEP08(2015)137 m H = 125.36 GeV. The combined signal strength is \u00b5 = 1.16 +0.16 \u22120.15 (stat.) +0.18 \u22120.15 (sys.). The data were analysed using a model where all Higgs boson couplings to the vector bosons are scaled by a common factor \u03ba V and those to the fermions by a factor \u03ba F . They are measured as |\u03ba V | = 1.06 +0.10 \u22120.10 and |\u03ba F | = 0.85 +0.26 \u22120.20 .",
