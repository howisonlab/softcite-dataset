Such a measurement is particularly important to test the Standard Model (SM) calculation for the (g\u22122) of the muon, where a long standing 3\u03c3 discrepancy is observed. I will review the ISR activity in KLOE in the last 20 years from the measurement of the hadronic cross section to the first direct determination of the time-like complex running \u03b1(s) in the region below 1 GeV.",

In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice (see Fig 1, left). Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a 5 members crew left on 24 April 1916 on a 7 m boat, the James Caird, from Elephant Island in the South Shetland Islands for a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the island of South Georgia (see Fig. 1, right). Shackleton indeed succeeded to reach the island, and on 30 August, after four attempts, Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. Every single man survived.",

Such a mental attitude especially applies when the object of a research is a precision measurement, as was the trip of the James Caird boat to South Georgia, a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean.

The high luminosity reached at flavor factories made it possible to compensate the smaller cross section of the radiative process, making ISR an alternative and competitive method with respect to the traditional energy scan [3]. From the theoretical side the development of the PHOKHARA Monte Carlo event generator [4], based on exact QED NLO predictions, together with improved Monte Carlo codes for luminosity measurement, like BABAYAGA [5] or BHWIDE [6] and MCGPJ [7], made it possible to reach the sub per cent accuracy on the measurement of ISR cross sections [8].",

Particularly a bias in the evaluation of the trigger correction was found, which together with a reevaluation of the luminosity (due to an improved version of Bhabha generator BABAYAGA [5]), resulted in a few % discrepancy in the two spectra below the \u03c1 peak, and a slightly smaller value of a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 (below one standard deviation) [21]. In the meantime a new analysis called (KLOE08 in the following) was carried out with the same SA selection criteria for pion tracks and photon angles as of KLOE05 on 240 pb \u22121 of data taken in 2002 [21]. With respect to KLOE05, KLOE08 profits from lower machine background and more stable DA\u03a6NE operation in 2002. Data filters and analysis technique were improved, together with a refined knowledge of the detector response and of the KLOE simulation and analysis, including a new version of generator PHOKHARA, with next-to-leading-order ISR and FSR corrections, as well as simultaneous emission of one ISR and one FSR photon [4]. All these refinement resulted in an improved 0.9% total systematic uncertainty consistent with KLOE05, with a total error smaller by 30%, confirming the 3\u03c3 discrepancy on the muon g-2. In view of the improvements of the analysis and the superior quality of the 2002 data, KLOE08 superseded KLOE05 [21].",

To reach the dipion threshold, a new measurement (called KLOE10 in the following) was performed where a photon was detected in the calorimeter at large polar angles, 50 o < \u03b8 \u03b3 < 130 o , in the same region where also pion tracks are detected (so called Large Angle (LA) selection) [22]. However, compared to the measurements with photons at small angles, these conditions imply a reduction in statistics of about a factor of 5, and an increase of the background from the process \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 o , as well as the irreducible background from events with final state radiation and from \u03c6 radiative decays. To reduce the background contamination and the related uncertainties, the analysis was performed on 232.6 pb \u22121 of data taken in 2006 at 1 GeV (i.e. 20 MeV below the \u03c6 mass). The KLOE10 analysis measured a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 in the region 0.1-0.85 GeV 2 with a 1% experimental systematic error and 0.9% theoretical one dominated by uncertainty on final state radiation (FSR) model. KLOE10 showed a good agreement with the previous KLOE measurements (see Fig. 3), allowing to cover 70% of the leading order hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly with 1% total error. It showed also a reasonable agreement with the results from the Novosibirsk experiments CMD-2 and SND (see Fig. 4, left); while comparing with the BaBar result it showed agreement below 0.4 GeV 2 (corresponding to a value of M \u03c0\u03c0 of 630 MeV), while above 0.4 GeV 2 the BaBar result is higher by 2-3% ( Fig. 4, right).",

As shown in Ref. [29] it's possible to extract the pion form factor by normalizing to the muon ISR differential cross section. In this approach the integrated luminosity as well as the radiation function H cancel in the ratio, as does the vacuum polarisation. In addition using the same fiducial volume, acceptance corrections to \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 and \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 spectra almost cancel resulting in a per mille systematic uncertainty. However the price to pay is to perform an additional analysis on muon events at subpercent level. The same sample of 239.2 pb \u22121 of KLOE08 was analyzed with the small angle photon selection (called KLOE12 in the following) [30]. While the analysis for \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 is essentially the same as for KLOE08, the analysis for \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 is new and is based on the following main features: 1) separation between \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 and \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 events obtained assuming the final state of two charged particles with equal track mass M T RK and one photon: the M T RK < 115 MeV (M T RK > 130 MeV) selection leads to 9\u00d710 5 (3. techniques, such as a kinematic fit or tighter cuts on the quality of the charged tracks, all providing consistent results; 2) trigger, particle identification and tracking efficiencies checked from data control samples. The \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 cross section measurement was compared with the one obtained by PHOKHARA MC [4], and a good agreement is found [30]. Then the pion form factor has been extracted and compared with the one from KLOE10, showing good agreement (see Fig. 6, left). The value for a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 computed with KLOE12 was in good agreement with the previous KLOE results, providing therefore a strong cross check of the systematics and confirming the 3\u03c3 discrepancy between the experimental value and the Standard Model prediction of the muon g-2 (see Fig. 6 right). . Left: pion form factor |F \u03c0 | 2 obtained by \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3/\u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 ratio (KLOE12) compared with previous KLOE measurements. Right: compilation of recent results for a \u00b5 compared with the experimental value.

This has been done by using the PHOKHARA MC event generator, which includes next-to-leading-order ISR and FSR contributions [4]. Figure 7, left, shows the ratio of the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 cross-section from data with the corresponding NLO QED calculation from PHOKHARA generator including the Vacuum Polarization effects. The agreement between the two cross sections is excellent. We use Eq. (1) to extract the running of the effective QED coupling constant \u03b1(s). By setting in the MC the electromagnetic coupling to the constant value \u03b1(s) = \u03b1(0), the hadronic contribution to the photon propagator, with its characteristic \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 interference structure, is clearly visible, see Fig. 7, right. The prediction from Ref. [40] is also shown. While the leptonic part is obtained by perturbation theory, the hadronic contribution to \u03b1(s) is obtained via an evaluation in terms of a weighted average  compilation of R had (s), based on the available experimental e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons annihilation data (for an up to date compilation see [41] and references therein).",
