            "text": "Transverse momentum (p T ) spectra of neutral pions and \u03b7 mesons in pp collisions at the LHC are interesting for several reasons. First, the measurement of these spectra helps characterize particle production in a new energy regime and allows to test phenomenological rules like m T scaling and x T scaling observed at lower \u221a s. More importantly, these measurements test perturbative QCD at the highest available energies. With the current data in the range p T < 30 GeV/c one constrains the gluon fragmentation function used in these calculations. Moreover, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra in pp are a basic ingredient in the extraction of direct photons as they are the dominant sources of the photons from hadron decays. Finally, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 p T spectra in pp collisions provide a reference for the study of nuclear effects in Pb-Pb collisions with the aid of the nuclear modification factor [1].",

            "text": "Perturbative QCD calculations are based on a factorization of phenomenological parton distribution and fragmentation functions (FF) and calculable parton cross sections. The parton distribution functions in the Bjorken-x range around x \u2248 0.01, relevant for the data presented here, are well under control. Gluon fragmentation functions, however, are not so well constrained from e + e \u2212 data as gluon jets are a subleading NLO correction in these reactions [2]. Pion and \u03b7 meson production at moderate p T 30 GeV/c at the LHC, on the other hand, is dominated by gluon fragmentation. For instance, at \u221a s = 7 TeV about 90 % of the neutral pions at p T = 10 GeV/c come from gluon fragmentation [3]. At the RHIC energy of \u221a s = 0.2 TeV the fraction of neutral pions from gluon fragmentation at the same p T is about 40 % [3]. Hence, the measurement of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra in collisions of hadrons provides important constraints for the gluon fragmentation function.",

            "text": "The ALICE detector [8] at the LHC measures photons and neutral mesons in three different ways: with PHOS, with EMCAL, and with photon conversions. PHOS is a homogenous electromagnetic calorimeter made of lead tungstate (PbWO 4 ) crystals. It subtends a pseudo-rapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.13 and an azimuthal range \u2206\u03c6 = 60 \u2022 . EMCAL is a lead scintillator sandwich calorimeter. In its current form it subtends |\u03b7| < 0.7 and \u2206\u03c6 = 100 \u2022 (\u2206\u03c6 = 40 \u2022 in 2010). Electron-Positron pairs from photon conversions between the beam pipe and the middle of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) (radial distance R \u2248 180 cm) can be detected with the TPC [9,10]. The detector material in this range (11.4 % of a radiation length X 0 ) corresponds to a photon conversion probability of p conv \u2248 8.5 %. The lower p T threshold for the detection of an electron or positron is p T,min \u2248 50 MeV/c. The measurement of photon conversions provides a detailed study of the material budget of the ALICE experiment. Up to the middle of the TPC the ALICE material budget agrees within +3.4 %/\u22126.2 % with its implementation in the GEANT simulation package.",
