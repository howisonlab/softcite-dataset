We propose to search for the EDM of strange and charm baryons at LHC, extending the ongoing experimental program on the neutron, muon, atoms, molecules and light nuclei. The EDM of strange \u039b baryons, selected from weak decays of charm baryons produced in p p collisions at LHC, can be determined by studying the spin precession in the magnetic field of the detector tracking system. A test of CP T symmetry can be performed by measuring the magnetic dipole moment of \u039b and \u039b baryons. For short-lived \u039b + c and \u039e + c baryons, to be produced in a fixedtarget experiment using the 7 TeV LHC beam and channeled in a bent crystal, the spin precession is induced by the intense electromagnetic field between crystal atomic planes. The experimental layout based on the LHCb detector and the expected sensitivities in the coming years are discussed. from INFN (Italy), MinECo and GVA (Spain).",

The existence of permanent EDMs requires the violation of parity (P) and time reversal (T ) symmetries and thus, relying on the validity of the CP T theorem, the violation of CP symmetry. Since EDM searches started in the fifties [1,2], there has been an intense experimental program, leading to limits on the EDM of leptons [3][4][5], neutron [6], heavy atoms [7], proton (indirect from 199 Hg) [8], and \u039b baryon [9]. New experiments are ongoing and others are planned, including those based on storage rings for muon [10,11], proton and light nuclei [12-a e-mail: fernando.martinez@ific.uv.es b e-mail: nicola.neri@mi.infn.it 14]. Comprehensive reviews on EDM experiments can be found in Refs. [15][16][17][18][19][20][21].",

The SM Lagrangian of strong interactions contains a CP-violating term proportional to the QCD vacuum angle \u03b8 ; however, no CP violation has been observed in the strong interactions. A stringent upper bound, \u03b8 < \u223c 10 \u221210 , is derived from the experimental limit on the EDM of the neutron, <3.0 \u00d7 10 \u221226 e cm (90% C.L.) [6]. This degree of tuning in the value of \u03b8 is known as the \"strong CP\" problem. Several solutions have been proposed, among which is the Peccei-Quinn mechanism [22][23][24] that predicts the axion as a candidate for dark matter.",

A sizeable spin precession angle for the short-lived \u039b + c and \u039e + c baryons would be possible by exploiting the intense electromagnetic field between crystal atomic planes. The charm baryon decays can be reconstructed using the LHCb detector. From one month dedicated runs, sensitivities at the level of 10 \u221217 e cm can be reached. This research would extend the physics program of the proposed experiment [34,35] for the measurement of charm baryon MDMs.",

The angular distribution for non-channeled particles allows to determine the initial polarization along the y axis, which compared to the final polarization allows to extract the gyromagnetic and gyroelectric factors. The same method applies to both \u039b + c and \u039e + c baryons. For \u039b + c decaying to two-body final states such as pK * 0 , \u0394 ++ \u03c0 \u2212 , \u039b(1520)\u03c0 + and \u039b\u03c0 + , the angular distribution is described by Eq. 1, where \u03b1 is a parity violating coefficient depending on the final state,k the direction of the final state baryon in the \u039b + c helicity frame, and s the \u039b + c polarization vector. In the case of the \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + decay, the \u03b1 parameter is measured to be \u03b1 \u039b\u03c0 + = \u22120.91 \u00b1 0.15 [38].

Eventually, a Dalitz plot analysis would provide the ultimate sensitivity to the EDM measurement. The initial polarization s 0 of \u039b + c particles produced from the interaction of 7 TeV protons on a fixed target has not been measured. However, a measurement of \u039b + c polarization from 40-70 MeV/c neutron on carbon target gives s 0 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 [56], and a measurement from interaction of 230 MeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 on copper target yields s 0 = \u22120.65 +0.22 \u22120.18 [57].",

Tracking devices upstream of the dipole magnet Table 1 Dominant \u039b production mechanisms from heavy baryon decays and estimated yields produced per fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, shown separately for SL and LL topologies. The \u039b baryons from \u039e \u2212 decays, produced promptly in the p p collisions, are given in terms of the unmeasured production cross section SL events  (VErtex LOcator and Tracker Turicensis) and downstream the magnet (T stations) are modelled to have rectangular shape. The height and width of the tracking layers along the beam axis are determined by the detector angular acceptance, between 10 and 250 mrad (300 mrad) in the vertical (horizontal) direction, as illustrated in (left) Fig. 3. Particle trajectories are approximated by straight lines defined by the momentum directions. Table 2 summarizes the geometric efficiencies for \u039b baryons decaying in different regions of the detector volume, for three different SL topologies. Region R 1 is defined such that the z position of the \u039b decay vertex is in the range [0-40] cm from the collision point and the decay products are within the detector acceptance. Events in the R 2 region have a \u039b decay z position in the range  cm. Charged particles produced together with the \u039b baryon are required to be within the VELO and T1-T3, or the VELO and TT acceptances, to insure a precise reconstruction of the \u039b origin vertex. Events in the R 1 region provide the measurement of the initial \u039b polarization vector; events in the R 2 region allow to determine the polarization as a function of the \u039b decay length in the magnetic field region. Among the latter, \u039b baryons decaying towards the end of the magnet (M 3 region in Table 2) provide most of the sensitivity to the EDM and MDM. These events are sketched in (right) Fig. 3. The total geometric efficiency for R 1 and R 2 regions is about 16%, with small differences among SL topologies, and about 2.4\u00d710 10 \u039b baryons per fb \u22121 can be reconstructed.",

Fixed-target collision events can be recorded in short dedicated runs or in parallel to the p p data taking, if the background caused by the insertion of a fixed target in the beam halo is negligible with respect to p p collisions. Both solutions have to be studied in detail using ad-hoc simulations. The \u039b + c cross section can be estimated from the total charm production cross section measured by the PHENIX experiment in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [73], \u03c3 cc = (567 \u00b1 57 stat. \u00b1 193 syst. ) \u00b5b, rescaled to \u221a s = 114.6 GeV assuming a linear dependence on \u221a s. By applying the \u039b + c fragmentation function used in Ref. [73], \u03c3 \u039b + c /\u03c3 cc \u2248 5.6%, compatible with theoretical predictions [74], the \u039b + c cross section is \u03c3 \u039b + c \u2248 18.2 \u00b5b. The channeling efficiency in silicon crystals, including both channeling angular acceptance and dechanneling effects, is estimated to be \u03b5 CH \u2248 10 \u22123 [75], while the fraction of \u039b + c baryons decaying after the crystal is \u03b5 DF (\u039b + c ) \u2248 19%, for \u03b3 = 1000 and 10 cm crystal length. The geometrical acceptance for \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decaying into the LHCb detector is \u03b5 geo \u2248 25% according to simulation studies.

The LHCb software-based trigger for the upgrade detector [69] is expected to have efficiency for charm hadrons comparable to the current high level trigger [46], i.e. \u03b5 trigger \u2248 80%. A specific trigger scheme for the fixed-target experiment can be adopted to enhance the trigger efficiency for \u039b + c decays close to 100%. For example, a trigger based on the energy loss in a instrumented silicon crystal was used in the E761 experiment to enhance the rate of reconstructed channeled \u03a3 + baryons [48]. The tracking efficiency is estimated to be 70% per track, leading to an efficiency \u03b5 track \u2248 34% for a \u039b + c decay with three charged particles.

The \u039b strange baryons are selected from weak charm baryon decays produced in p p collisions at \u2248 14 TeV center-of-mass energy, while \u039b + c and \u039e + c charm baryons are produced in a fixed-target experiment to be installed in the LHC, in front of the LHCb detector. Signal events can be reconstructed using the LHCb detector in both cases. The sensitivity to the EDM and the MDM of the strange and charm baryons arises from the study of the spin precession in intense electromagnetic fields. The long-lived \u039b precesses in the magnetic field of the detector tracking system. Shortlived charm baryons are channeled in a bent crystal attached to the target and the intense electric field between atomic planes induces the spin precession. Sensitivities for the \u039b EDM at the level of 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u221218 e cm can be achieved using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 50 fb \u22121 to be collected during the LHC Run 3. A test of CP T symmetry can be performed by measuring the MDM of \u039b and \u039b baryons with a precision of about 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 on the g factor. The EDM of the \u039b + c (\u039e + c ) can be searched for with a sensitivity of 1.3 (2.0) \u00d7 10 \u221217 / \u221a t (month) e cm with dedicated runs or running in synergetic mode with the LHCb experiment, in parallel to p p collisions. Both solutions have to be studied in details using ad-hoc simulations. The proposed experiment would allow about two orders of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity for the \u039b EDM and the first search for the charm baryon EDM, expanding the search for new physics through the EDM of fundamental particles.",

            "text": "The variation of the \u039b momentum direction in the laboratory frame results in an initial polarization vector which is not fixed to be perpendicular to the magnetic field. The relative orientation of the spin and magnetic field vectors is determined by two rotations. On one hand, the polarization vector from the equation of motion is given in the comoving rest frame reached from the laboratory frame, S L , by a pure boost. This is usually referred to as canonical frame [77]. However, the analyser, given by Eq. (1), is defined in the is correlated with its apparent production point on the z plane in S L intersecting the PV. These points are shown by the short-dashed lines traced back from the \u039b trajectory (intersecting the H decay point). The angle \u03b8 (\u03b8 L ) is formed by the \u039b momentum in the S H (S L ) frame with respect to the z axis in S H particle helicity frame. The two rest frames, canonical and helicity, are related by the rotation between the S L and S \u039bL frames, defined by the \u039b and H momentum directions in S L (see Fig. 1). One the other hand, the choice of the S \u039bL frame induces a second rotation of the polarization components with respect to the S \u039b frame, where the \u039b longitudinal polarization is maximal, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This is known in the literature as Wick rotation. To avoid dilution effects, the change of the polarization has to be analysed as a function of the kinematics of the decay. For example, a longitudinally polarized \u039b with polarization s 0 along z in S \u039b would have a transverse component in S \u039bL of magnitude s 0 sin \u03b1, with sin \u03b1 = (m \u039b /m H )( p (L) H / p (L) \u039b ) sin \u03b8 [77]. As shown in Fig. 6, the \u039b helicity angle \u03b8 and the spin direction are related to the \u039b impact parameter in the laboratory [82]. The relation can be exploited to define ensembles of \u039b particles having similar initial polarization, therefore improving the sensitivity to detect the spin change.",

Since no correlation matrix is provided in the article, the errors are calculated assuming no correlation among the helicity amplitude results obtained for the above quasi two-body decays when integrating over all the decay angles, except for the helicity angle of the baryon daughter of the \u039b + c . The computed \u03b1 parameters are listed in Table 4.",
