The following three decays are considered: H \u2192 e\u03c4 , H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 , and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 . The searches are based on the data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. No significant excess is observed, and upper limits on the lepton-flavour-violating branching ratios are set at the 95% confidence level: Br(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < 1.04%, Br(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < 1.43%, and Br(Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < 1.69 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .",

            "text": "The most stringent bounds on the LFV decays of the Higgs and Z bosons other than H \u2192 \u03bce are derived from direct searches [20]. The CMS Collaboration has performed the first direct search for LFV H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 decays [21] and reported a small excess (2.4 standard deviations) of data over the predicted background. Their results give a 1.51% upper limit on Br(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) at the 95% confidence level (CL). The ATLAS Collaboration has also performed a search [22] for the LFV H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 decays in the final state with one muon e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch and one hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton, \u03c4 had , and reported a 1.85% upper limit on Br(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) at the 95% CL. The most stringent indirect constraint on H \u2192 e\u03bc decays is derived from the results of searches for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 decays [23], and a bound of Br(H \u2192 e\u03bc) < O(10 \u22128 ) is obtained [24,25]. The bound on \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 decays suggests that the presence of a H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 signal would exclude the presence of a H \u2192 e\u03c4 signal, and vice versa, at an experimentally observable level at the LHC [25]. It is also important to note that a relatively large Br(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) can be achieved without any particular tuning of the effective couplings, while a large Br(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) is possible only at the cost of some fine-tuning of the corresponding couplings [25]. Upper bounds on the LFV Z \u2192 e\u03bc, Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 and Z \u2192 e\u03c4 decays were set by the LEP experiments [26,27]: Br(Z \u2192 e\u03bc) < 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , Br(Z \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < 9.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , and Br(Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 95% CL. The ATLAS experiment set the most stringent upper bound on the LFV Z \u2192 e\u03bc decays [28]: Br(Z \u2192 e\u03bc) < 7.5\u00d710 \u22127 at 95% CL.",

The first study is a search for H \u2192 e\u03c4 decays in the final state with one electron and one hadronically decaying \u03c4 -lepton, \u03c4 had . The second analysis is a simultaneous search for the LFV H \u2192 e\u03c4 and H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 decays in the final state with a leptonically decaying \u03c4 -lepton, \u03c4 lep . A combination of results of the earlier ATLAS search for the LFV H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 had decays [22] and the two searches described in this paper is also presented. The third study constitutes the first ATLAS search for LFV decays of the Z boson with hadronic \u03c4 -lepton decays in the channel Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 had . The search for LFV decays in the \u03c4 lep analysis is based on the novel method introduced in Ref. [29]; the searches in the \u03c4 had analyses are based on the techniques developed for the SM H \u2192 \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had search. All three searches are based on the data sample of pp collisions collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Given the overlap between the analysis techniques used in the H \u2192 e\u03c4 had search and in the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 had search, from here on they are referred to as the \u03c4 had channels; the H \u2192 \u03c4 lep search is referred to as the \u03c4 lep channel, where = e, \u03bc.",

In the \u03c4 had channels, the Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and multi-jet backgrounds are estimated from data, while the other remaining backgrounds are estimated from simulation, as described below.",

In this approach, essential features such as the modelling of the kinematics of the produced boson, the modelling of the hadronic activity of the event (jets and underlying event) as well as contributions from pile-up are taken from data. Therefore, the dependence on the simulation is minimised and only the \u03c4 -lepton decays and the detector response to the \u03c4 -lepton decay products are based on simulation. This hybrid sample is referred to as embedded data in the following. A detailed description of the embedding procedure can be found in Ref. [40].",

The associated production (Z H and W H) samples are simulated using PYTHIA8.

In the H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 and H \u2192 e\u03c4 decays, the \u03c4 -lepton decays are treated as unpolarised because the left-and right-handed \u03c4 -lepton polarisation states are produced at equal rates.

The uncertainties on the W +jets normalisa- tion and m MMC e\u03c4 shape corrections are treated as uncorrelated between SR1 and SR2. The uncertainties in r QCD (\u00b113%) and in the normalisation (\u00b113%) and modelling of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 also play an important role. The normalisation uncertainty (\u00b17%) for the Z \u2192 ee (with e \u2192 \u03c4 misid had ) background has a limited impact on the sensitivity because of a good separation of the signal and Z \u2192 ee peaks in the m MMC e\u03c4 distribution. The other major sources of experimental uncertainty, affecting both the shape and normalisation of signal and backgrounds, are the uncertainty in the \u03c4 had energy scale [34], which is measured with \u00b1(2-4)% precision (depending on p T and decay mode of the \u03c4 had candidate), and uncertainties in the embedding method used to model the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 background [35]. Less significant sources of experimental uncertainty, affecting the shape and normalisation of signal and backgrounds, are the uncertainty in the jet energy scale [37,62] and resolution [63]. The uncertainties in the \u03c4 had energy resolution, the energy scale and resolution of electrons, and the scale uncertainty in E miss T due to the energy in calorimeter cells not associated with physics objects are taken into account; however, they are found to be only \u00b1(1-2%). The following experimental uncertainties primarily affect the normalisation of signal and backgrounds: the \u00b12.8% uncertainty in the integrated luminosity [64], the uncertainty in the \u03c4 had identification efficiency [34], which is measured to be \u00b1(2-3)% for 1-prong and \u00b1(3-5)% for 3prong decays(where the range reflects the dependence on p T of the \u03c4 had candidate), the \u00b12.1% uncertainty for triggering, reconstructing and identifying electrons [33], and the \u00b12% uncertainty in the b-jet tagging efficiency [38].",

The first effect is due to events containing misidentified and non-prompt leptons, together referred to as non-prompt in the following. These leptons originate from misidentified jets or from hadronic decays within jets. They contribute differently to the \u03bce and e\u03bc samples because the origin of the non-prompt lepton is different for electrons and for muons. The second effect originates from the different dependencies on p T and |\u03b7| that the trigger efficiency and reconstruction efficiency can have for electrons and muons. The non-prompt effect is accounted for by estimating the non-prompt background separately from the other backgrounds. The efficiency effect is accounted for by scaling the m coll distribution of the e\u03bc sample with a scale factor parameterised as a function of the sub-leading lepton p T , p 2 T . As shown in Sect. 5.5, the e\u03bc-\u03bce symmetry is restored when these two effects are taken into account. Smaller effects, which might depend on other parameters such as \u03b7 or p 1 T , are found to be negligible. Events containing non-prompt leptons The background contribution due to non-prompt leptons is estimated with the matrix method described in Refs. [68,69], which relies on the difference in identification efficiency between prompt and non-prompt leptons. Two lepton categories are defined: tight leptons, which must satisfy all the lepton identification criteria described in Sect. 2, and loose leptons, which are not required to satisfy the primary vertex and isolation criteria. By measuring separately for prompt and non-prompt leptons the tight-to-loose lepton efficiencies, defined as the fraction of loose leptons that are also tight, one can determine the non-prompt background contribution from the number of data events that have two leptons that are either loose or tight. The efficiencies for prompt and non-prompt leptons, parameterised as a function of p T and \u03b7, are derived from data with the tag-and-probe method. Prompt efficiencies are derived from an opposite-sign sample enriched in Z \u2192 e \u00b1 e \u2213 and Z \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 .

Three LFV decays are considered: H \u2192 e\u03c4 , H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 , and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 . The search for the Higgs boson decays is performed in the final states where the \u03c4lepton decays either to hadrons or to leptons (electron or muon). The search for the Z boson decays is performed in the final state with the \u03c4 -lepton decaying into hadrons. No significant excess is observed, and upper limits on the LFV branching ratios are set. The observed and the median expected 95% CL upper limits on Br(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) are 1.04% and 1.21 +0.49 \u22120.34 %, respectively. This direct search for the H \u2192 e\u03c4 decays places significantly more stringent constraints on Br(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) than earlier indirect estimates. In the search for the H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 decays, the observed and the median expected 95% CL upper limits on Br(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) are 1.43% and 1.01 +0.40 \u22120.29 %, respectively. A small deficit of data compared to the predicted background is observed in the search for the LFV Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 decays. The observed and the median expected 95% CL upper limits on Br(Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) are 1.69 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 2.58 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , respectively. tion of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
