CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) and availability of circularly and linearly polarized tagged photon beams provide unique conditions for this type of experiments. Recent addition of the Frozen Spin Target (FROST) gives a remarkable opportunity to measure double and triple polarization observables for different pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction processes. For the first time, a complete or nearly complete experiment becomes possible and will allow model independent extraction of the reaction amplitude. An overview of the experiment and its current status is presented.",

            "text": "Among the most exciting and challenging topics in sub-nuclear physics today is the study of the structure of the nucleon and its different modes of excitation, the baryon resonances. Initially, most of the information on these excitations came primarily from partial wave analysis of data from \u03c0N scattering. Recently, these data have been supplemented by a large amount of information from pion electro-and photoproduction experiments. Yet, in spite of extensive studies spanning decades, many of the baryon resonances are still not well established and their parameters (i.e., mass, width, and couplings to various decay modes) are poorly known. Much of this is due to the complexity of the nucleon resonance spectrum, with many broad, overlapping resonances. While traditional theoretical approaches have high-lighted a semi-empirical approach to understanding the process as proceeding through a multitude of s-channel resonances, t-channel processes, and nonresonant background, more recently attention has turned to approaches based on the underlying constituent quarks. An extensive review of the quark models of baryon masses and decays can be found in Ref. [1] . Most recently lattice QCD is making significant progress in calculations of baryon spectrum. While these quark approaches are more fundamental and hold great promise, all of them predict many more resonances than have been observed, leading to the so-called \"missing resonance\" problem. One possible reason why they were not observed because they may have small coupling to the \u03c0N . At the same time they may have strong coupling to other final states \u03b7N , \u03b7 \u2032 N , KY, 2\u03c0N .x Table 1. Polarization observables in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction. The entries in parentheses signify that the same polarization observables also appear elsewhere in the table. There are three objects in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction which can be polarized: photon beam, target nucleon and recoil baryon. There are 16 observables which can be measured. Table 1 lists all of them in three groups: beam-target, beam recoil and target-recoil. The photoproduction reactions can be described in terms of four complex amplitudes. Therefore, in order to be able to perform full reconstruction of the amplitude one need to measure at least eight carefully chosen observables from at least two different groups. This implies requirement of having polarized beam, polarized target and recoil polarimetry. Hyperons have a remarkable feature: their weak decay is self-analyzing. This gift of nature allows us to measure their polarization without polarimeter.",

High quality data for the cross sections of \u03c0 0 [2] , \u03c0 + [3] , \u03b7 [4] , \u03b7 \u2032 [5] and kaon photoproduction were obtained.

Then, to get helicity asymmetry, E, this raw asymmetry was corrected for beam and target polarization and effective dilution factor. At this stage of the analysis we used very rough estimate of these corrections A very preliminary results for helicity asymmetry for \u03c0 + photoproduction are presented in Figures 4 -7. This represents about 10% of available statistics.    One can see that asymmetry is large and energy evolution displays various structures in angular dependence. This is just one example of what is coming in near future. The analysis of all other final states is underway.",
