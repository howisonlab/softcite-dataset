This measurement uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 collected by the D0 experiment in Run II of Fermilab's Tevatron pp Collider at a centerof-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The measured integrated ratio of 0.0236 \u00b1 0.0032 (stat) \u00b1 0.0035 (syst) is in agreement with predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD and the Monte Carlo event generators pythia and alpgen. Studies of Z boson production in association with a bottom and an anti-bottom quark provide important tests of the predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [1,2]. A good theoretical description of this process is essential since it forms a major background for a variety of physics processes, including standard model (SM) Higgs boson production in association with a Z boson, ZH(H \u2192 bb) [3], and searches for supersymmetric partners of the b quark [4].",

The measurement of the ratio benefits from the cancellation of many systematic uncertainties, such as the uncertainty in luminosity and those related to lepton and jet identification, allowing a more precise comparison with theory. The remaining systematic uncertainties arise from the differences between b jets and light jets. In the following, light-quark flavor (u, d, s) and gluon jets are referred to as \"light jets\". The Z + 2 b jet production cross sections have been measured at CMS [12] and ATLAS [13] at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The current measurement is based on the complete Run II data sample collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron pp collider at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 .",

A liquid argon and uranium calorimeter has a central section (CC) covering pseudorapidities |\u03b7 det | 1.1, and two end calorimeters (EC) that extend coverage to |\u03b7 det | \u2248 4.2, with all three housed in separate cryostats [18]. An outer muon system, at |\u03b7 det | < 2, consists of a layer of tracking detectors and scintillation counters in front of 1.8 T toroids, followed by two similar layers after the toroids. Luminosity is measured using plastic scintillator arrays located in front of the EC cryostats. The trigger and data acquisition systems are designed to accommodate the high instantaneous luminosities of Run II.",

The shape of the templates may be affected by the choice of the b quark fragmentation function [33], the background estimation, the difference in the shape of the light jet MC template and a template derived from a light jet enriched dijet data sample, and the composition of the charm states used to determine the charm template shape [8].

These effects are evaluated by varying the central values by the corresponding uncertainties, one at a time. The entire analysis chain is checked for possible biases using a MC closure test and no significant deviations are observed. The next largest systematic uncertainty of 5.5% is due to the b-jet identification efficiency. The uncertainty on b-jet energy calibration is 2.6%; it comprises the uncertainties on the jet energy resolution and the jet energy scale.

The last three columns show theoretical predictions obtained using NLO QCD with scale uncertainties and two MC event generators, pythia and alpgen. In summary, we report the measurement at the Tevatron of the ratio of integrated cross sections, \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z + 2 b jet)/\u03c3(pp \u2192 Z + 2 jet), for events with Z \u2192 \u2113\u2113 in a restricted phase space of leptons with p \u2113 T > 15 GeV, |\u03b7 \u2113 | < 2.0 and with two jets limited to p jet T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | < 2.5. Measurements are based on the full data sample collected by the D0 experiment in Run II of the Tevatron, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The measured integrated ratio of 0.0236 \u00b1 0.0032 (stat) \u00b1 0.0035 (syst) is in agreement with the theoretical predictions within uncertainties.",
