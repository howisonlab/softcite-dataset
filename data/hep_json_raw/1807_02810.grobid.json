The measurements are performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and are based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Events containing one electron, one muon, and two jets from the hadronization and fragmentation of b quarks are used.

            "text": "At the LHC, top quark and antiquark pairs (tt) are dominantly produced in the scattering of the proton constituents via quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at an energy scale (Q) of about two times the t quark mass (m t ). The properties of the t quark can be studied directly from its decay products, as it decays before hadronizing. Mediated by the electroweak interaction, the t quark decay yields a W boson and a quark, the latter carrying the QCD color charge of the mother particle. Given the large branching fraction for the decay into a bottom quark, B(t \u2192 Wb) = 0.957 \u00b1 0.034 [1], in this analysis we assume that each t or t quark yields a corresponding bottom (b) or antibottom (b) quark in its decay. Other quarks may also be produced, in a color-singlet state, if a W \u2192 qq decay occurs. Being colored, these quarks will fragment and hadronize giving rise to an experimental signature with jets. Thus, when performing precision measurements of t quark properties at hadron colliders, an accurate description of the fragmentation and hadronization of the quarks from the hard scatter process as well as of the \"underlying event\" (UE), e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch defined below, is essential. First studies of the fragmentation and hadronization of the b quarks in tt events have been reported in Refs. [2,3]. In this paper, we present the first measurement of the properties of the UE in tt events at a scale Q \u2265 2m t .",

Because of energy-momentum conservation, the UE constitutes the recoil against the tt system. In this study, the hadronization products of initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) that cannot be associated to the particles from the tt decays are probed as part of the UE, even if they can be partially modeled by perturbative QCD. The main contribution to the UE comes from the color exchanges between the beam particles and is modeled in terms of multiparton interactions (MPI), color reconnection (CR), and beam-beam remnants (BBR), whose model parameters can be tuned to minimum bias and Drell-Yan (DY) data.",

This is relevant as a direct probe of CR, which is needed to confine the initial QCD color charge of the t quark into color-neutral states. The CR mainly occurs between one of the products of the fragmentation of the b quark from the t quark decay and the proton remnants. This is expected to induce an ambiguity in the origin of some of the final states present in a bottom quark jet [4][5][6]. The impact of these ambiguities in the measurement of t quark properties is evaluated through phenomenological models that need to be tuned to the data. Recent examples of the impact that different model parameters have on m t can be found in Refs. [7,8].",

Three different signal ME generators are used: powheg, MadGraph5_amc@nlo (v2.2.2) with the FxFx merging scheme [22,23] for jets from the ME calculations and PS, and sherpa (v2.2.4) [24]. The latter is used in combination with OpenLoops (v1.3.1) [25], and with the CS parton shower based on the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction scheme [26]. In addition, two different herwig PS versions are used and interfaced with powheg: herwig++ [27] with the EE5C UE tune [28] and the CTEQ6 (L1) [29] PDF set, and herwig 7 [27,30] with its default tune and the MMHT2014 (LO) [31] PDF set. Additional variations of the Pw+Py8 sample are used to illustrate the sensitivity of the measurements to different parameters of the UE model. A supplementary table, presented in the appendix, details the parameters that have been changed with respect to the CUETP8M2T4 tune in these additional variations. The variations include extreme models that highlight separately the contributions of MPI and CR to the UE, fine-grained variations of different CR models [5,32], an alternative MPI model based on the \"Rope hadronization\" framework describing Lund color strings overlapping in the same area [33,34], variations of the choice of \u03b1 S (M Z ) in the parton shower, and a variation of the values that constitute the CUETP8M2T4 tune, according to their uncertainties.",

For clarity, the p T of the leptons has been rescaled by a factor of 0.5 (PF) algorithm [9] is used for the reconstruction of finalstate objects. The offline event selection is similar to the one described in Ref. [47]. At least one PF charged lepton candidate with p T > 25 GeV and another one with p T > 20 GeV, both having |\u03b7| < 2.5, are required. The two leptons must have opposite charges and an invariant mass m( \u00b1 \u2213 ) > 12 GeV. When extra leptons are present in the event, the dilepton candidate is built from the highest p T lep-tons in the event. Events with e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 in the final state are used for the main analysis, while e \u00b1 e \u2213 and \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 events are used to derive the normalization of the DY background. The simulated events are corrected for the differences between data and simulation in the efficiencies of the trigger, lepton identification, and lepton isolation criteria. The corrections are derived with Z \u2192 e \u00b1 e \u2213 and Z \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 events using the \"tag-and-probe\" method [48] and are parameterized as functions of the p T and \u03b7 of the leptons.",

The latter is  estimated making use of the so-called R out/in method [53], in which events with same-flavor leptons are used to normalize the yield of e\u03bc pairs from DY production of \u03c4 lepton pairs. The normalization of the simulation is estimated from the number of events in the data within a 15 GeV window around the Z boson mass [53]. For e\u03bc events, we use the geometric mean of the scale factors determined for ee and \u03bc\u03bc events. With respect to the simulated predictions, a scale factor 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 is obtained from this method, with statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The systematic uncertainty is estimated from the differences found in the scale factor for events with 0 or 1 b-tagged jets, in the same-flavor channels.   We select a total of 52 645 e\u03bc events with an expected purity of 96%. The data agree with the expected yields within 2.2%, a value smaller than the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity alone, 2.5% [12].

An   uncertainty of \u00b14.6% in the inelastic pp cross section is used and propagated to the event weights [63]. Trigger and selection efficiency: The scale factors used to correct the simulation for different trigger and lepton selection efficiencies in data and simulation are varied up or down, according to their uncertainty. The uncertainties in the muon track and electron reconstruction efficiencies are included in this category and added in quadrature. Lepton energy scale: The corrections applied to the electron energy and muon momentum scales are varied separately, according to their uncertainties. The corrections and uncertainties are obtained using methods similar to those described in Refs. [64,65]. These variations lead to [GeV]  a small migration of events between the different p T ( ) or m( ) categories used in the analysis. Jet energy scale: A p T -and \u03b7-dependent parameterization of the jet energy scale is used to vary the calibration of the jets in the simulation. The corrections and uncertainties are obtained using methods similar to those described in Ref. [51]. The effect of these variations is similar to that described for the lepton energy scale uncertainty; in this case the migration of events occurs between different jet multiplicity categories. Jet energy resolution: Each jet is further smeared up or down depending on its p T and \u03b7, with respect to the central value measured in data. The difference with respect to data is measured using methods similar to those described   in Ref. [51]. The main effect induced in the analysis from altering the jet energy resolution is similar to that described for the jet energy scale uncertainty. b tagging and misidentification efficiencies: The scale factors used to correct for the difference in performance between data and simulation are varied according to their uncertainties and depending on the flavor of the jet [52]. The main effect of this variation is to move jets into the candidate b jets sample or remove them from it. Background normalization: The impact of the uncertainty in the normalization of the backgrounds is estimated by computing the difference obtained with respect to the nominal result when these contributions are not subtracted from data. This difference is expected to cover   the uncertainty in the normalization of the main backgrounds, i.e., DY and the tW process, and the uncertainty in the normalization of the tt events that are expected to pass the reconstruction-level requirements but fail the generator-level ones. The total expected background contribution is at the level of 8-10%, depending on the bin. The impact from this uncertainty is estimated to be < 5%.",

The dependence on the CR model is furthermore tested using other models besides the nominal one, which is the MPI-based CR model where the tt decay products are excluded from reconnections to the UE. A dedicated sample where the reconnections to resonant decay products are enabled (hereafter designated as ERDon) is used to evaluate possible differences in the unfolded results. In addition, alternative models for the CR are tested. One sample utilizing the \"gluon move\" model [5], in which gluons can be moved to another string, and another utilizing the \"QCD-based\" model with string formation beyond LO [32] are used for this purpose. In both samples, the reconnections to the decay resonant processes are enabled. The envelope of the differences is considered as a systematic uncertainty. t quark p T : The effect of reweighting of the simulated t quark p T ( p T (t)) distribution to match the one reconstructed from data [69,70] is added as an additional uncertainty. This has the most noticeable effect on the fraction of events that do not pass the reconstruction-level requirements and migrate out of the fiducial phase space. t quark mass: An additional uncertainty is considered, related to the value of m t = 172.5 GeV used in the simulations, by varying this parameter by \u00b10.5 GeV [71].",

A more complete treatment could only be achieved with a fully tuned UE, which lies beyond the scope of this paper. While no sensitivity is found to \u03b1 ISR S (M Z ), most observables are influenced by the choice of \u03b1 FSR S (M Z ). The most sensitive variable is found to be p T and the corresponding variation of the \u03c7 2 function is reported in Fig. 26. A polynomial interpolation is used to determine the minimum of the scan (best fit), and the points at which the \u03c7 2 function increases by one unit are used to derive the 68% confidence interval (CI). The degree of the polynomial is selected by a stepwise regression based on an F-test statistics [72]. A value of \u03b1 FSR S (M Z ) = 0.120 \u00b1 0.006 is obtained, which is lower than the one assumed in the Monash tune [73] and used in the CUETP8M2T4 tune. The value obtained is compatible with the one obtained from the differential cross sections measured as a function of p T in different p T ( ) regions or in events with different additional jet multiplicities. Table 4 summarizes the results obtained. From the inclusive results, we conclude that the range of the energy scale that corresponds to the 5% uncertainty attained in the determination of \u03b1 FSR S (M Z ) can be approximated by a [ \u221a 2, 1/ \u221a 2] variation, improving considerably over the canonical [2, 0.5] scale variations.",

The measurement makes use of \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016, and corresponding to 35.9 fb \u22121 . Using particleflow reconstruction, the contribution from the UE has been isolated by removing charged particles associated with the decay products of the tt event candidates as well as with pileup interactions from the set of reconstructed charged particles per event. The measurements performed are expected to be valid for other tt final states, and can be used as a reference for complementary studies, e.g., of how different color reconnection (CR) models compare to data in the description of the jets from W \u2192 qq decays. The chosen observables and categories enhance the sensitivity to the modeling of multiparton interactions (MPI), CR and the choice of strong coupling parameter at the mass of Z boson (\u03b1 FSR S (M Z )) in the pythia8 parton shower Monte Carlo simulation. These parameters have significant impact on the modeling of tt production at the LHC. In particular, the compatibility of the data with different choices of the \u03b1 FSR S (M Z ) parameter in pythia8 has been quantified, resulting in a lower value than the one considered in Ref. [73].",

The data also disfavor the default configurations in powheg+herwig++, powheg+herwig7, and sherpa.

In addition, they can be used to improve the assessment of systematic uncertainties in future top quark analyses. The results obtained in this study show that a value of \u03b1 FSR S (M Z ) = 0.120 \u00b1 0.006 is consistent with the data.
