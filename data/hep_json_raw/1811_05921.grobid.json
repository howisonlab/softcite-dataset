Both techniques have been tested in an engineering run in 2017 and the detector already reached the goal resolution of \u223c 35 ps.

The resulting positron momentum resolution will be improved by a factor of 3 with respect to MEG, going below 100 keV/c, while the positron reconstruction efficiency will be improved by a factor of 2, mainly thanks to the longer extent of the chamber.

The present limit on \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 by the MEG collaboration already strongly constrains the NP models and an improvement of one order of magnitude is expected with MEG-II. We investigated some long term prospects for the \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 search. Our estimates show that a 3-year run with an accelerator delivering around 10 9 muons per second could allow to reach a sensitivity of a few 10 \u221215 (expected 90% upper limit on the \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 BR), with poor perspectives of going below 10 \u221215 even with 10 10 muons per second. Below 5 \u00d7 10 8 muons per second, the calorimetric approach needs to be used in order to reach this target. If a muon beam rate exceeding 10 9 muons per second is available, the much cheaper photon conversion option would be recommended and would provide similar sensitivities. The sensitivity would be eventually limited by the fluctuations of the interaction of the particles with the detector materials: this indicates that a further step forward in the search for \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 would require a radical rethinking of the experimental concept.",
