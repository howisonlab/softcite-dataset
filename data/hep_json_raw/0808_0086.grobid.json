One of the main goals of the spin program is the measurement of the transverse spin effects in semi-inclusive DIS off transversely polarised nucleons. In the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 data have been taken using a 160 GeV /c naturally polarised \u00b5 + beam and a deuterium target ( 6 LiD) transversely polarised respect to the beam direction. In 2007 the run year has been devoted to collect data with a proton (N H 3 ) target. The preliminary results for the Collins and Sivers asymmetries, extracted from the 2007 data with transverse target polarisation, are presented here. Results are also compared with existing model predictions.",

The latter, which describes the probability of finding a quark with spin parallel to the nucleon spin in a transversely polarised nucleon, is chiral-odd and can be measured in transversely polarised nucleon (anti)-nucleon hard scattering or in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on a transversely polarised target.

[5][6][7] In 2007 COM-PASS took data with a proton target (N H 3 ) and a 50% sharing between longitudinal and transverse target configuration, accumulating \u223c 40 \u2022 10 12 and \u223c 42 \u2022 10 12 \u00b5 on tape respectively. A new target with a larger diameter (4 cm) and three cells (upstream, central, downstream, 30, 60, and 30 cm long respectively) have been used: the tree cells setup is meant to reduce the difference in acceptance between the two polarisations. The upstream and the downstream cells are polarised along the same direction, which is opposite to the central cell. The Ammonia material is characterized by a dilution factor f \u223c 0.15 and a very high polarisation: \u223c 90%. As in 2006 the target is inside the new large acceptance Superconducting magnet. The transverse run has been divided in 12 \"periods\", each of them corresponding to about 5 full days of data taking. Consecutive periods correspond to opposite polarisation of each of the tree target cells. Asymmetries are extracted using at the same time the informations coming from cells in two consecutive periods with opposite configuration. Almost all the data collected in the transverse polarisation configuration of the target have been processed a first time. For the results presented here about 20% of the whole collected data have been used. These data have been selected requiring a good stability of the spectrometer and of the reconstruction between consecutive periods. In the analysis the events are considered only if one primary vertex is found in the target region. To select DIS events the photon virtuality Q 2 is taken greater than 1 (GeV/c) 2 , y between 0.1 and 0.9, and the invariant mass of the final hadronic state W > 5 GeV/c 2 . The hadron sample on which the asymmetries are computed consists of all the charged hadrons coming from the reaction vertex with p h T > 0.1 GeV/c and z > 0.2. In table 1 the final statistics entering the asymmetries extraction is given for the 6 used periods, separately for positive and negative hadrons. Figure 1 illustrates the Q 2 -x Bjorken phasespace covered by the COMPASS experiment after the Q 2 > 1 selection. As it can be seen the high energy of the muon beam allow to reach the 10 \u22123 region of x, in the DIS regime, moreover most of the statistic is at low x values: 0.008 \u00f7 0.02. A number of systematic studies have been performed in order to determine the systematic errors. Extensive tests both to measure false asymmetries p r e l i m i n a r y and to investigate the stability of the physics results, in each data taking period, were done combining cells with the same polarisation and using different splitting combination of the target cells (top-bottom, left-right).",

In total, the asymmetries were evaluated in 9 x-bins, 9 p h T -bins, and 8 z-bins. The method used for extraction is based on a two dimensional (8 times 8) binning in \u03a6 h and \u03a6 S . Combining the information of the opposite target polarisation cells a nonlinear system of equations for the cross section amplitude modulations can be written, and the extraction of the amplitudes is then obtained via maximum likelihood method. The results have been checked with several other statistical methods described in Ref. 6. In figure 2 the preliminary results for the Collins asymmetries as function of x, p h T , and z are shown both for positive and for negative unidentified hadrons. The asymmetry is small, basically statistically compatible with zero up to x = 0.05 while a signal is visible in the last points: the asymmetry then increases in module up to 10% and with oppoiste sign for positive and negative hadrons. For p h T and z the asymmetry amplitude is compatible with zero due to the fact that most of the statistical sample is in the low x region. In fact requiring x > 0.05 the asymmetry signal becomes more evident both in p h T and z bins. This can be seen in fig. 3, showing Collins asymmetry for the data in the valence region, i.e. with x > 0.05. It is clear from the plots that there is not an appreciable z or p h T dependence.

A new target with a larger diameter (4 cm) and three cells (upstream, central, downstream, 30, 60, and 30 cm long respectively) have been used: the tree cells setup is ment to reduce the difference in acceptance between the two polarisations. The upstream and the downstream cells are polarised along the same direction, which is opposite to the central cell. The Ammonia material is characterized by a dilution factor f \u223c 0.15 and a very high polarisation: \u223c 90%. As in 2006 the target is inside the new large acceptance Superconducting magnet. The transverse run has been divided in 12 \"periods\", each of them corresponding to about 5 full days of data taking. Consecutive periods correspond to opposite polarisation of each of the tree target cells. Asymmetries are extracted using at the same time the informations coming from cells in two consecutive periods with opposite configuration. Almost all the data collected in the transverse polarisation configuration of the target have been processed a first time. For the results presented here about 20% of the whole collected data have been used. These data have been selected requiring a good stability of the spectrometer and of the reconstruction between consecutive periods. In the analysis the events are considered only if one primary vertex is found in the target region. To select DIS events the photon virtuality Q 2 is taken greater than 1 (GeV/c) 2 , y between 0.1 and 0.9, and the invariant mass of the final hadronic state W > 5 GeV/c 2 . The hadron sample on which the asymmetries are computed consists of all the charged hadrons coming from the reaction vertex with p h T > 0.1 GeV/c and z > 0.2. In table 1 the final statistics entering the asymmetries extraction is given for the 6 used periods, separately for positive and negative hadrons. Figure 1 illustrates the Q 2 -x Bjorken phasespace covered by the COMPASS experiment after the Q 2 > 1 selection. As it can be seen the high energy of the muon beam allow to reach the 10 \u22123 region of x, in the DIS regime, moreover most of the statistic is at low x values: 0.008 \u00f7 0.02.
