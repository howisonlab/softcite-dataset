This paper reports a search for such phenomena in the e\u00b5 invariant mass spectrum m e\u00b5 . The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV in the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The search strategy is designed to be model independent as much as possible. The results are interpreted in terms of the characteristics of the following predicted states: a \u03c4 sneutrino ( \u03bd \u03c4 ), which can be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) [1][2][3] in R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric (SUSY) models [4], a heavy Z gauge boson in LFV models [5], and quantum black holes (QBHs) [6,7]. The theoretical underpinnings in the context of this search are introduced below.",

Such theories also provide the possibility of producing microscopic black holes [6,7] at the LHC. In contrast to semiclassical thermal black holes that can decay to high-multiplicity final states, QBHs are nonthermal objects, expected to decay predominantly to pairs of particles. We consider the production of spin-0, colorless, neutral QBHs in a model with LFV [9], in which the cross section for QBH production depends on the threshold mass m th in n additional spatial dimensions. The n = 1 possibility corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane-world model [10], and n > 1 corresponds to the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model [11]. While the resonant \u03bd \u03c4 and Z signals generate narrow peaks in the invariant mass spectrum of the e\u00b5 pair, the distribution of the QBH signal is characterized by a sharp edge at the threshold of QBH production, followed by a monotonic decrease at larger masses.

The two trajectories are then combined in a global-muon track hypothesis. Muon candidates are required to have p T > 53 GeV and to fall into the acceptance region of |\u03b7| < 2.4. The transverse and longitudinal impact parameters of muon candidates relative to the primary vertex must be less than 0.2 cm and <0.5 cm, respectively. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects chosen are those that have been defined using information from the various subdetectors, including jets, charged leptons, and the associated missing transverse momentum, which is defined as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets and charged leptons, measured in the silicon tracker. The track of the muon candidate must have at least one hit in the pixel detector and hits in at least six silicon-strip layers, and must contain matched segments in at least two muon detector planes. To suppress backgrounds arising from muons within jets, the scalar-p T sum of all other tracks in the tracker within a cone of \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.3 around the muon candidate track, where \u03b7 and \u03c6 are the pseudorapidity and azimuth angle of a track, is required to have less than 10% of the p T of the muon candidate.

The W\u03b3 process also contributes to the prompt background category through the internal conversion of \u03b3 to leptons. The QCD-multijet process provides subleading contributions to the fake lepton background. An estimate of the W\u03b3 background is obtained at LO from MC simulation based on the MadGraph5 amc@nlo event generator. DY+jets background in -5 -JHEP04 (2018)073ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels are generated at NLO using the powheg 2.0 [38][39][40] event generator. A background estimate based on a control sample in data is made using jet-to-electron misidentification rates (F ) to determine the m e\u00b5 contributions from W+jets and multijet distributions. The jet-to-electron misidentification rate is measured in data, using a control sample collected with a single electromagnetic-cluster trigger. Data sidebands are used to evaluate the contributions to the control sample from genuine electrons and from photons misidentified as electrons. The jet-to-electron misidentification rate is then defined as the number of jets passing the full electron selection divided by the number of jet candidates in the sample. The rate is quantified in bins of p T and \u03b7. The measured rate is used to estimate the W+jets and multijet contributions using data containing muons that pass the single-muon trigger and the full muon selection, and the number of electron candidates satisfying relaxed selection requirements, but failing the full electron selection. Each event is weighted by the factor F/(1 \u2212 F ) to determine the overall contribution from the jet backgrounds. Contributions from processes other than W+jets and multijet sources are subtracted from the sample, after correcting for the contribution from false events to avoid double counting, which is done using MC simulated background events. Background from jets mimicking muons is estimated to be only 1% of the total background, and is ignored in the analysis.",

The tt background provides an uncertainty of <30% in the total background yield at m e\u00b5 \u2248 1 TeV, which reduces to <10% at m e\u00b5 \u2248 2 TeV because of the reduced contribution of the tt process to the total background yield. The uncertainty in the WW background is estimated to be \u22482.5% at m e\u00b5 \u2248 1 TeV. This is estimated from the envelope of the resummed next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm calculation of the soft-gluon contributions to the cross section at NLO, as presented in ref. [41], using changes by factors of 2 and 0.5 implemented in the renormalization and factorization scales, respectively. Other uncertainties in the form of the invariant mass distribution are due to the uncertainty in the muon momentum scale, which depends on the \u03b7 and \u03c6 of muons, and leads to an uncertainty in the total background yield of \u22481.1%, at m e\u00b5 = 500 GeV, and \u224825% at m e\u00b5 = 2 TeV. Uncertainty in the muon-efficiency scale factor is 2-3% over the whole mass range. Apart from that, a momentum-dependent, one-sided downward systematic uncertainty is applied to the muon reconstruction and identification efficiency, to account for potential differences between simulated samples and data, in the response of the muon system to muons that interact radiatively with the detector material. This uncertainty is -1.6% in the region |\u03b7| < 1.6, and -14.4% in the region 1.6 < |\u03b7| < 2.4, for muons with momentum of 4 TeV. Uncertainties in the electron p T scale and resolution, the muon p T resolution, and the pileup rate have negligible impact on the total background. Un--6 -JHEP04(2018)073 certainty in the electron-efficiency scale factor is 2-3% over the whole mass range. The uncertainty associated with the choice of the PDF in the simulation is evaluated according to the PDF4LHC prescription [42,43].",

Lower limits of 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6 TeV are set on the threshold mass of quantum black holes in a model with 4, 5, and 6 large extra spatial dimensions, respectively. For the model with a single, warped -12 -JHEP04 (2018)073extra spatial dimension, the lower limit on the threshold mass is 3.6 TeV. Also, a Z boson with a 10% branching fraction to the e\u00b5 channel is excluded for masses below 4.4 TeV. In all cases, the results of this search improve the previous lower limits by about 1 TeV.",
