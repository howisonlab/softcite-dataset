            "text": "Measurements of particle production in heavy-ion collisions enable the study of properties of a hot and dense nuclear medium called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1][2][3][4]. An initial striking observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was that production of high transverse momentum (p T ) hadrons in Au+Au collisions is strongly suppressed compared to that in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. This suppression indicates that partons experience substantial energy loss as they traverse the QGP, a phenomenon called jetquenching [5]. A control experiment involving a deuteron projectile on a heavy-ion target, d+Au, was carried out to test whether the feature of strong energy loss is still present in a collision system of much smaller size. The results in d+Au collisions at midrapidity presented in Ref. [6] showed no suppression at high p T , initially leading to the conclusion that QGP itself-and associated jet quenching-were unique to collisions of larger heavy ions. In the ten years because these initial measurements, indications of QGP formation in smaller collision systems including d+Au have been found, though without evidence of jet quenching phenomena [7].",

            "text": "These nuclear effects may be due to initial-and/or finalstate multiple scatterings of incoming and outgoing partons [13,14]. Processes such as radial flow [15] and recombination [16] developed for heavy-ion collisions were also investigated to explain a stronger enhancement of p andp over \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 [11]. Recent results of collectivity amongst identified particles in small collision systems at RHIC and the Large Hadron Collider [7] have been also explained within the hydrodynamic evolution model [17,18]. The study of particle production at forward and backward rapidity can provide additional information on nuclear effects such as initial-state energy loss [19] and modification of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) [20][21][22][23][24]. Of particular interest are gluons at * PHENIX Spokesperson: akiba@rcf.rhic.bnl.gov \u2020 Deceased small Bjorken x Bj (fraction of the proton's longitudinal momentum carried by the parton), where the dramatic increase of gluon density leads to expectation of saturation. This is often described within the color glass condensate (CGC) framework [25]. A strong centrality dependent suppression of single and dihadron production has been observed at forward rapidity in d+Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV [8][9][10]. A CGC calculation provides a good description of the experimental data [26,27]. Also, a perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation considering coherent multiple scattering with small-x Bj gluons reproduces the suppression of particle production at forward rapidity [19,28]. Another very different explanation for the suppression at forward rapidity is that color fluctuation effects modify the size of the high-x Bj partons in the proton [29,30]. Accessible quark and gluon x Bj ranges depend on the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and transverse momentum of final state hadrons or jets. Therefore, measurements over a wide kinematic range are quite useful to further understand nuclear effects in small collision systems. PHENIX experiment has two muon spectrometers that provide wide coverage at forward (x Bj \u2248 0.02, shadowing region) and backward rapidity (x Bj \u2248 0.1, antishadowing region). In the previous study of nuclear effects on charged hadron production in d+Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV [31], a significant suppression was observed at forward rapidity in high multiplicity collisions compared to that in low multiplicity collisions, whereas a moderate enhancement is seen at backward rapidity. Although the direction of modification is consistent with the expectation from nPDF modification, no specific model comparison was presented. High statistics data samples of p+p, p+Al, and p+Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV were collected in 2015 by PHENIX. These data samples combined with the availability of a new forward silicon vertex tracking detectors, which enable the selection of particle tracks coming from the collision point, significantly improved p T and \u03b7 resolutions. The charged hadron analysis with these data sets can extend the previous study in d+Au collisions [31], and a comparison between p+Al and p+Au of very different size of nuclei can provide new information on nuclear effects on charged hadron production in p+A collisions.",

Figure 2 shows the longitudinal momentum (p z ) distributions of reconstructed tracks at the north arm MuID gaps 2 and 3 from a full geant4 detector simulation of charged hadrons (see Sec. III D). Muon tracks from light hadron decays show a narrow p z distribution in 2.5 < p z < 3.0 GeV/c, whereas tracks from hadrons show a much broader distribution. Therefore, tracks from hadrons can be enriched with a proper p z cut (3.5 GeV/c for gap 2 and 4 GeV/c for gap 3). The inset plots show the hadron fraction as a function of p T with the p z cuts. The hadron purity is > 98% (> 90%) at MuID gap 2 (gap 3) for p T > 1.5 GeV/c.

In this case, a MuTr track can be associated with a wrong FVTX track. This is referred to as a mis-association. Such mis-associations result in further smearing of the reconstructed p T and \u03b7. The FVTX-MuTr association efficiency depends on the event multiplicity. The probability of mis-association can be evaluated with a data driven method developed in [40,41] by associating a MuTr track with FVTX tracks from another event of similar FVTX track multiplicity. The same method has been used in this analysis, and the estimated fraction of misassociations in the p+p data is \u223c 1.5% at p T \u2248 1.5 GeV/c and decreases down to \u223c 0.5% at p T \u2248 5 GeV/c. In the 0%-5% highest multiplicity p+Au collisions, the estimated fraction of mis-associations in the south arm (Augoing direction) is \u223c 3% at p T \u2248 1.5 GeV/c and \u223c 1% at p T \u2248 5 GeV/c, which is a factor of two higher than the estimate for p+p collisions. The mis-association fraction is also checked with hadron simulation events embedded into real data events, and is consistent with the data driven values. The embedding simulation described in Sec. III D is used to take into account the multiplicity dependent FVTX-MuTr association efficiency.  In addition to the requirements on p z and FVTX-MuTr association, track quality cuts are applied. MuTr tracks are required to have at least 11 hits out of a maximum of 16 hits, and a 3\u03c3 MuTr track fit quality cut is applied. For association between MuTr and MuID tracks, three standard deviation cuts are applied to the angle and distance between MuTr and MuID tracks projected to the MuID gap 0. The associated FVTX track is required to have hits in at least three of the four stations, and an additional 3\u03c3 fit quality cut is applied. Momentum-dependent cuts are applied to the angle difference in the radial and azimuthal directions between FVTX and MuTr tracks projected to the middle of the absorber (z = 70 cm). These selections help reject tracks from decay muons, secondary hadrons, and FVTX-MuTr mis-associations.",

The trigger efficiency for hadrons at MuID gap 3 is higher than that for hadrons at MuID gap 2. The efficiency at the north arm in the p+p data is similar. Due to the larger statistical fluctuations at p T > 5 GeV/c, a fit function is used to obtain the p Tdependent trigger efficiency correction factors. The trig- ger efficiency is separately evaluated for each muon arm as well as each centrality bin of p+Al and p+Au collisions to account for possible multiplicity effects and detector performance variation during the data taking period. The relative variation of the trigger efficiency over the data taking period is less than 10%.

Here we follow that previous work as input for our simulation studies. To account for uncertainties on the estimated p T and \u03b7 distributions, weight factors in p T and \u03b7 for each collision system are extracted by comparing reconstructed p T and \u03b7 distributions between data and simulation. The variation of acceptance and efficiency with modified initial p T and \u03b7 distributions based on the weighting factors is less than 3% for p+p data.

            "text": "calculations based on two nPDF sets. In p+Au collisions, there is a modest hint that enhancement at backward rapidity becomes larger as \u03b7 approaches midrapidity, while the suppression at forward rapidity becomes stronger. In p+Al collisions, R pA at forward rapidity is quite similar to what is observed in p+Au collisions, whereas it shows a smaller enhancement at backward rapidity than the results in p+Au collisions. The comparison with ncteq15 and epps16 nPDF calculations indicates that the R pA at forward rapidity agrees in both p+Al and p+Au collisions, but the enhancement at backward rapidity in p+Au collisions is not reproduced by the both calculations. In case of the comparison with the pQCD calculations at backward rapidity, the magnitude of enhancement is similar. However, the pQCD calculations show a stronger enhancement at more backward rapidity which is different from the trend in the data. Because initial and final-state nuclear effects on hadron production may depend on the density of initial partons in the nucleus and on the density of final-state produced particles, R pA has been measured in various centrality bins of p+Al and p+Au collisions.  Fig. 11 is consistent with what is seen in R pA as a function of p T . The \u03b7 dependence at backward rapidity is weakly centrality dependent, but there is a clear \u03b7 dependence at forward rapidity in the most central collisions. Figures 12 and 13 show R pA of charged hadrons as a function of p T and \u03b7 in various centrality classes of p+Au collisions. Similar to the results in p+Al collisions, the magnitude of modification becomes larger in more central collisions both at forward and backward rapidity, and the R pA values in the most peripheral p+Au collisions are consistent with unity. When comparing p+Al and p+Au results in the 0%-5% central collisions shown in the panel (a) of Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13, R pA at forward rapidity is comparable between the two collision systems. However, the enhancement at backward rapidity is much stronger in p+Au collisions.  i.e. in the p-going direction, reveal that each collision system has its own decreasing trend as N part becomes larger. R pA at forward rapidity in 0%-5% of p+Al and p+Au collisions are consistent (R pA \u223c 0.7), although N part (9.7 in p+Au and 4.1 in p+Al collisions) are quite different. The trend of a larger enhancement (suppression) at backward (forward) rapidity in more central collisions is consistent with the previous results of charged hadrons and muons from heavy flavor decay in d+Au collisions [12,31]. A closer look on \u03b7-dependent R pA in 0%-5% p+Al and 40%-60% p+Au collisions of similar N part is shown in Fig. 15. At backward rapidity, it shows not only a consistent magnitude of R pA but also a quite similar trend of R pA in \u03b7. In case of the comparison at forward rapidity, R pA of the 40%-60% p+Au centrality bin is consistent with unity in all \u03b7 bins, whereas a \u03b7-dependent suppression is seen in 0%-5% p+Al collisions.",

It would be useful to extend another calculation within the CGC framework [27], which successfully describes the suppression of charged hadron production at forward rapidity in d+Au collisions [8,9]. More differential calculations from these various frameworks are needed to compare to the systematic trends found in our new results. In addition to these models which consider modification of the parton distribution functions inside the nucleus, the pQCD calculation of dynamic shadowing considering coherent multiple scatterings inside the nucleus [19] also predicts a rapidity and impact parameter dependent suppression of hadron production at forward rapidity. The centrality dependent suppression at forward rapidity shown in both p+Al and p+Au collisions also can be described by the color fluctuation effects expecting a stronger centrality dependence in p+Au collisions than d+Au collisions [30]. It will be quite useful to have theoretical calculations for detailed comparison with the data in p T , rapidity, and centrality.",

In contrast, there is no significant modification of charged hadron production observed in peripheral p+Al and p+Au collisions in either rapidity region. The enhancement at backward rapidity shows a clear A-dependence, but the suppression at forward rapidity is comparable between the two collision systems despite more than a factor two larger N part in p+Au collisions. The results integrated over centrality are compared to a calculation with the ncteq15 and epps16 nPDF sets. The calculation agrees with the data at forward rapidity both in the integrated centrality of p+Al and p+Au collisions, but it fails to describe the enhancement observed at backward rapidity in p+Au collisions. Because the nPDF sets does not yet provide an impact parameter dependent nPDF, the comparison is limited to the case of integrated centrality. These data measured in various centrality ranges can be useful to test impact parameter dependent nPDFs in different nuclei in the future. The pQCD calculation considering incoherent multiple scatterings inside the nucleus can describe the data at backward rapidity. In addition, a comparison with different models can help to improve the understanding of nuclear effects in small collision systems.",
