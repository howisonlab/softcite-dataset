The asymmetry is measured as a function of the electron pseudorapidity and is presented in five kinematic bins based on the electron transverse energy and the missing transverse energy in the event. The measured asymmetry is compared with next-to-leading-order predictions in perturbative quantum chromodynamics and provides accurate information for the determination of parton distribution functions of the proton. This is the most precise lepton charge asymmetry measurement to date.",

            "text": "Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are essential elements for cross section calculations at a hadron collider, and many precision measurements are dominated by the systematic uncertainty from PDFs. However, PDFs are not directly calculable within the standard model (SM) and must be determined using experimental inputs, including a wide range of scattering processes. At the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, a proton-antiproton (pp) collider with a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, the measurement of the electron charge asymmetry in the pp \u2192 W + X process provides important information for the determination of PDFs, as it is sensitive to the valence u and d quark and corresponding antiquark PDF distributions. In pp collisions, W + (W \u2212 ) bosons are produced primarily by the annihilation of valence quarks in the proton and antiproton. Since u quarks on average carry more momentum than d quarks [1][2][3], W + bosons tend to be boosted in the proton direction, while W \u2212 bosons tend to be boosted in the antiproton direction. This results in a non-zero W boson production charge asymmetry, defined as",

The W boson can decay leptonically with a charged lepton and a neutrino in the final state. The neutrino's presence can be inferred from an imbalance of transverse energy in the calorimeter, referred to as missing transverse energy ( / E T ). Reconstruction of the neutrino longitudinal momentum (p \u03bd z ) is not feasible due to the unknown longitudinal momentum of the initial state interacting partons. Without p \u03bd z , it is impossible to perform a direct measurement of the W boson charge asymmetry with traditional methods. Instead we use the lepton pseudorapidity (\u03b7) [4] distribution which is a convolution of the W boson production charge asymmetry and the V \u2212 A structure of the W boson decay. With a good understanding of the V \u2212 A structure, the lepton charge asymmetry as a function of lepton pseudorapidity can be used to constrain PDFs. The comparison between the W boson charge asymmetry and the lepton charge asymmetry is shown in Fig. 1, using the Monte Carlo (MC) event generator resbos [5] with the CTEQ6.6 [6] central PDF set.",

We measure the electron charge asymmetry in five kinematic bins by selecting on the electron transverse energy (E e T ) and event / E T . Results from different kinematic bins probe different ranges of y W , and thus different ranges of the fraction of proton momentum carried by the parton. There are three symmetric bins, (E e T > 25 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV), (25 < E e T < 35 GeV, 25 < / E T < 35 GeV), (E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 35 GeV) and two asymmetric bins, (25 < E e T < 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV), (E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV). With more data than in previous measurements and more data in the high pseudorapidity region, we provide information about the PDFs for a broader x range (0.002 < x < 0.99 for |\u03b7 e | < 3.2) at high Q 2 \u2248 M 2 W , where x is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the colliding parton, Q 2 is the momentum scale squared, and M W is the W boson mass. This analysis improves upon and supersedes the previous D0 electron charge asymmetry result [11]. That result did not include the improved detector level calibrations discussed in Sec. IV E and Sec. IV F. In addition, it did not include MC modeling of the difference in efficiency for electrons and positrons for different polarities of the solenoidal magnet surrounding the tracking region. This article also provides details of the comple-mentary analysis of Ref. [14] where the W boson charge asymmetry is measured using the same data set.",

Then, using this 2-D correction, we examine the other parameters dependences and develop a new 2-D correction to remove the largest two remaining dependencies.

The response of the calorimeter to the hadronic recoil differs from its response to objects which shower electromagnetically. This difference occurs because the hadronic calorimeter modules differ in construction from the electromagnetic modules and because the process by which hadrons interact in material is different from that of electrons and photons. In principle, if we knew the particle composition of the recoil, it would be possible to simulate the overall recoil response. However, there is no reliable model to estimate from first principles the particle composition of the recoil system.

We therefore assume this correlation in the asymmetry measurement is 100%. Similarly, for the electron energy tuning, recoil modeling, MC modeling, background modeling, and unfolding procedure, 100% correlation between each \u03b7 e bin is assumed when producing the correlation matrix. The other systematic uncertainties, e.g., EMID and electron charge misidentification, are obtained using Z \u2192 ee events with the same bin size as the electron asymmetry measurement. We therefore assume there is zero correlation between \u03b7 e bins. With the assumptions described above and combined in quadrature, we build the correlation matrices for each kinematic bin, which are presented in Tables VII-XI.",

            "text": "The asymmetry results for \u03b7 e > 0 are found to be consistent with those for \u03b7 e < 0, so we assume CP invariance with A(\u03b7 e ) being equivalent to \u2212A(\u2212\u03b7 e ). The data for \u03b7 e < 0 are folded appropriately with those for \u03b7 e > 0 to increase the statistics, and results are presented for |\u03b7 e |. We perform the electron charge asymmetry measurement in five kinematic bins. Results from the different kinematic bins probe different ranges of y W , and thus different ranges of the fraction of proton momentum carried by the parton. The measured electron asymmetries with symmetric kinematic cuts on E e T and / E T (E e T > 25 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV; 25 < E e T < 35 GeV, 25 < / E T < 35 GeV; and E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 35 GeV) and the differences between measured values and mc@nlo [34] with the NNPDF2.3 [35] PDF set predictions are shown in Figs. 13-15. For the measured electron asymmetries with asymmetric kinematic cuts (25 < E e T < 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV; E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV), the differ-ences between measured values and predictions are shown in Figs. 16 and 17. The PDF bands are obtained from mc@nlo using the NNPDF2.3 NLO PDF uncertainty sets. The central value of predictions from mc@nlo with herwig [36] using the MSTW2008NLO [37] central PDF set and from resbos with photos [25] (for QED final state radiation) using the CTEQ6.6 central PDF set are also included. The theory curves are generated with selection criteria applied to the electron and neutrino generator-level transverse momenta, with all the radiated photons merged into the electron if they fall within a cone of radius \u2206R < 0.3. Generator-level W bosons are further required to have a transverse mass in the range between 50 and 200 GeV and to have a transverse momentum less than 120 GeV. The measured electron charge asymmetries are consistent with predictions for the inclusive kinematic bin E e T > 25 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV. In the kinematic bins with asymmetric cuts (25 < E e T < 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV; E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV), the measured electron charge asymmetries are consistent with predictions from resbos using the CTEQ6.6 central PDF set, but in the kinematic bins with symmetric cuts (25 < E e T < 35 GeV, 25 < / E T < 35 GeV; E e T > 35 GeV, / E T > 35), the measured electron charge asymmetries are not consistent with any of the considered predictions, with the \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. between measured asymmetry and the mc@nlo with NNPDF2.3 predictions equal to 47.1/13 and 95.5/13, respectively. The results presented here are in good agreement with those of Ref. [12] for the muon charge asymmetry for both E \u2113 T > 25 GeV, / E T > 25 GeV and E \u2113 T > 35 GeV, / E T > 35 GeV. This agreement is noteworthy since the analysis techniques and dominant systematic uncertainties in the two measurements are quite different. The results are consistent with the previously published results [11] in the |\u03b7 e | < 2 region, and disagree in the high |\u03b7 e | region. In this paper, compared to the previous results [11], there are several improvements for the modeling of electrons in high |\u03b7 e | region, including the \u03b7-dependent energy scale corrections, recoil system modeling, and the positron/electron identification efficiency corrections. This measurement thus supersedes the results of Ref. [11].",

Our measurement is the most precise lepton charge asymmetry measurement to date. The uncertainty on the measured asymmetry is smaller than the PDF uncertainty for most of the bins.
