            "text": "This paper presents a search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons in the final state of two muons and two \u03c4 leptons. The analysis is based on data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15.0 and 62.5 GeV are probed. Below 15 GeV, the pseudoscalar bosons are Lorentz-boosted, causing their decay products to be collimated and to fail the isolation selection criteria used in this analysis. The analysis scans the reconstructed dimuon mass spectrum for a characteristic resonance structure. Four different final states are studied to cover the different possible \u03c4 lepton decay modes: \u00b5\u00b5 + e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5 + e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u00b5 + \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u00b5\u00b5 + \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , where \u03c4 h denotes a \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically. The \u00b5\u00b5 + ee and \u00b5\u00b5 + \u00b5\u00b5 final states are not considered because of their smaller branching fractions and the large background contribution from Z boson pair production. The event selection and signal extraction used in this analysis have been optimized for the h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u00b52\u03c4 decay channel, where h has a mass of 125 GeV. Events from the h \u2192 aa \u2192 4\u03c4 process can also enter the signal region when at least two of the \u03c4 leptons decay leptonically to muons and neutrinos. These events are treated as a part of the signal even if they do not exhibit a narrow dimuon mass peak. Assuming 2HDM-like scenarios, the ratio of the branching fractions of a \u2192 2\u00b5 and a \u2192 2\u03c4 is proportional to the ratio of the squared masses of the muon and the \u03c4 lepton:",

This criterion strongly suppresses both the background from events with genuine leptons, which arise mostly from the Z boson pair production, and the backgrounds with jets misidentified as \u03c4 leptons, leaving only a few expected background events in the signal region. The background from Z boson pair production is estimated from simulation, whereas the background with jets misidentified as \u03c4 leptons is estimated from data, as detailed in section 5. The presence of a signal is probed using the reconstructed dimuon mass as an observable.

They are simulated at leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with the MLM jet matching and merging scheme [24]. The generator is interfaced with pythia 8.212 [25] to model the parton showering and fragmentation as well as the decay of the \u03c4 leptons. The CUETP8M1 tune [26] is chosen for the pythia parameters controlling the description of the underlying event.

The term p \u00b5 T denotes the muon p T . The azimuthal angle, \u03c6, is expressed in radians. Jets are reconstructed from PF objects with the anti-k T clustering algorithm implemented in the FastJet library [36,39], using a distance parameter of 0.4.

The algorithm builds a discriminant from variables related to potential secondary vertices associated to the jet, and from track-based lifetime information. The working point chosen in this search provides an efficiency for b quark jets of approximately 70%, and a misidentification rate for light-flavor jets of approximately 1%.

Types I-IV 2HDM+S forbid flavor changing neutral currents at tree level. In type I 2HDM+S, all SM particles couple to the first doublet and the branching fractions of the light pseudoscalar to SM particles are independent of tan \u03b2, defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the second doublet to that of the first doublet. In type II 2HDM+S, including the NMSSM, up-type quarks couple to the first doublet, and leptons and down-type quarks couple to the second doublet. This leads to pseudoscalar decays to leptons and down-type fermions enhanced for tan \u03b2 > 1. In these two types, the analysis is sensitive to a cross section larger than approximately three times the SM production cross section of the Higgs boson for B(h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u00b52\u03c4 ) = 100%. In type III 2HDM+S, quarks couple to the first doublet and leptons to the second one, making it the most favorable type of 2HDM+S for h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u00b52\u03c4 decays at large tan \u03b2. In type IV 2HDM+S, leptons and up-type quarks couple to the first doublet while down-type quarks couple to the second doublet. With m a , tan \u03b2, and the type of 2HDM+S specified, the branching fractions of the pseudoscalars to SM particles can be predicted following the prescriptions in refs. [11,49]. The results expressed as limits on (\u03c3 h /\u03c3 SM )B(h \u2192 aa) are shown in figure 5 for the last two types of 2HDM+S. The most stringent limits are obtained in 2HDM+S type III at large tan \u03b2, where the couplings to leptons are enhanced, and where limits of approximately 3% are set for tan \u03b2 3. This analysis improves previous results [14] in the 2\u00b52\u03c4 final state by a factor two or more for 15.0 < m a < 62.5 GeV in all four types of 2HDM+S.",

These are the most stringent limits obtained in the final state of two muons and two \u03c4 leptons for the masses above 15 GeV, improving previous limits [14,20] by more than a factor two. They provide the tightest constraints in this mass range on exotic Higgs boson decays in scenarios where the decays of pseudoscalar bosons to leptons are enhanced.  Figure 5. Observed limits on (\u03c3 h /\u03c3 SM )B(h \u2192 aa) in 2HDM+S type III (left) and type IV (right). The contour lines shown for B(h \u2192 aa) = 1.0 and 0.34 correspond to the colour scale indicated on the right vertical scale. The number 0.34 corresponds to the limit on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to beyond-the-SM particles at 95% CL obtained with data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV by the CMS and ATLAS experiments [10].",
