Both experiments obtained evidence for\u03bd\u00b5 \u2192\u03bde oscillations, and MiniBooNE also observed a \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bde excess.",

These are the differences between the squared mass values. A model with three neutrinos will have two independent mass splittings. In the presently accepted picture of neutrino oscillations, the magnitude of the mass splitting between \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 is \u2206m 2 21 = (7.50 \u00b1 0.185) \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 , and \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3 is \u2206m 2  This paper focuses primarily on LSND and MiniBooNE, two experiments that were constructed to probe the \u2206m 2 \u223c1 eV 2 region. In 1995, LSND was the first experiment to publish evidence for a signal at \u2206m 2 \u223c 1 eV 2 , observing\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e (4,5,6,7). MiniBooNE was proposed (8) in 1998 to follow up on this signal, while substantially changing the systematics. MiniBooNE saw excesses in \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e modes (9,10,11).",

The normalization of LSND is approximately 30% higher than the global fit, but the energy-dependent shape is well described.

A key difference with respect to LSND is the KARMEN location at 17.7 m from the target at a 100 \u2022 angle to the proton beam. KARMEN did not observe an oscillation signal(34) and obtained the 90% CL limit shown inFig. 5. KARMEN restricts part of the LSND region and, through a joint analysis with LSND, was used to determine a combined allowed region for the two experiments(35).The most controversial cuts in the DAR analysis have been those on the fiducial volume. Questions arose because of an apparent up-down asymmetry in the first LSND result, presented in 1995. The result, which also used a stricter energy cut, E e > 36 MeV, than the final analysis, had only nine candidate events, with six at Y < 0 and three at Y > 0 (4). Although this is not a highly improbable Y distribution, concern was raised because the top of the detector had complete veto coverage, while the bottom did not. Continued running smoothed the statistical fluctuation.Table 2provides the oscillation probabilities for the final event sample with exercises in varying the fiducial cuts, showing that the signal is resilient to these cuts.Another useful cross-check maintains the Electron Selection cuts but employs an R \u03b3 > 10 cut rather than the template fit. This isolates a very clean signal, revealing the hallmark L/E distribution evident inFig. 6.

The two matrix elements are related to the mixing angles according to Eqs. 5, 6, and 7. Before fitting all of the data sets, a simple calculation can be used to show that the combined appearance and disappearance results from LSND and MiniBooNE alone already stress this model in the \u2206m 2 > 1 eV 2 region. In a 3+1 model, the mixing angle limit from the LSND-KARMEN cross section analysis translates to a limit on |U 2 e4 |, through Eq. 7, that is roughly 0.05, although there are large variations with \u2206m 2 . The stringent sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5\u00b5 limit from the MiniBooNE-SciBooNE joint analysis corresponds to |U \u00b54 | 2 < 0.025, using Eq. 6. Thus, the disappearance results favor a very small appearance mixing angle, which, from Eq. 5, is about sin 2 2\u03b8 \u00b5e \u223c 0.005 and is not in good agreement with LSND and MiniBooNE. Therefore, the LSND and MiniBooNE data alone will force a lower \u2206m 2 solution. , 0.17, and 0.15, for \u2206m 2 , |U e4 |, and |U \u00b54 |, respectively.

The conclusive observations that neutrinoshave mass and that lepton flavor is not conserved have changed the direction of the field. Now, the indications from LSND, MiniBooNE, and other experiments that a new type of sterile neutrino might exist could have an equally important impact. Both LSND and MiniBooNE see indications of electron neutrino/antineutrino appearance, but there are discrepancies in the energy distributions of the appearance signal that could or could not be related to oscillations. The analysis of all high \u2206m 2 data sets shows that models with several sterile neutrinos can give acceptable global fits. Reported incompatibility with sterile neutrino models, especially between the appearance and disappearance measurements, may be arising from the choice of test statistic, rather than an underlying discrepancy with the data sets. Investigations of high \u2206m 2 oscillations currently form one of the most active areas of neutrino physics and many new experiments are being mounted or considered. This future program builds on the initial measurements of LSND and MiniBooNE discussed here and aims to provide a definitive exploration of new physics signals in the neutrino sector, such as sterile neutrinos.",
