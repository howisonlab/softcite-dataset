The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The results of the search are interpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small compared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range considered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as 140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is found. A simultaneous fit to the four decay modes yields upper limits on the production cross-section of a heavy Higgs boson times the branching ratio to Z boson pairs. 95 % confidence level upper limits range from 0.53 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.008 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the gluon-fusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.009 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also interpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models.",

These modes are referred to, respectively, as , \u03bd\u03bd, qq, and \u03bd\u03bdqq. It is assumed that additional Higgs bosons would be produced predominantly via the gluon fusion (ggF) and vectorboson fusion (VBF) processes but that the ratio of the two production mechanisms is unknown in the absence of a specific model. For this reason, results are interpreted separately for ggF and VBF production modes. For Higgs boson masses below 200 GeV, associated production (VH, where V stands for either a W or a Z boson) is important as well. In this mass range, only the decay mode is considered. Due to its excellent mass resolution and high signal-to-background ratio, the decay mode is well-suited for a search for a narrow resonance in the range 140 < m H < 500 GeV; thus, this search covers the m H range down to 140 GeV. The search includes channels sensitive to VH production as well as to the VBF and ggF production modes. The qq and \u03bd\u03bd searches, covering m H ranges down to 200 and 240 GeV respectively, consider ggF and VBF channels only. The \u03bd\u03bdqq search covers the m H range down to 400 GeV and does not distinguish between ggF and VBF production. Due to their higher branching ratios, the qq, \u03bd\u03bd, and \u03bd\u03bdqq decay modes dominate at higher masses, and contribute to the overall sensitivity of the combined result. The m H range for all four searches extends up to 1000 GeV.",

A heavy Higgs boson with the width and branching fractions predicted by the SM was excluded at the 95 % confidence level in the ranges 182 < m H < 233 GeV, 256 < m H < 265 GeV, and 268 < m H < 415 GeV by the mode; in the ranges 300 < m H < 322 GeV and 353 < m H < 410 GeV by the qq mode; and in the range 319 < m H < 558 GeV by the \u03bd\u03bd mode. The searches in this paper use a data set of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected at a centre-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. Besides using a larger data set at a higher centre-of-mass energy, these searches improve on the earlier results by adding selections sensitive to VBF production for the , qq, and \u03bd\u03bd decay modes and by further optimizing the event selection and other aspects of the analysis. In addition, the \u03bd\u03bdqq decay mode has been added; finally, results of searches in all four decay modes are used in a combined search. The CMS Collaboration has also recently published a search for a heavy Higgs boson with SM width in H \u2192 Z Z decays [8]. Since the searches reported here use a narrow width for each Higgs boson mass hypothesis instead of the larger width corresponding to a SM Higgs boson, a direct comparison against earlier ATLAS results and the latest CMS results is not possible.",

The ID consists of pixel and silicon microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 2.5, surrounded by a transition radiation tracker (TRT), which improves electron identification in the region |\u03b7| < 2.0. The sampling calorimeters cover the region |\u03b7| < 4.9. The forward region (3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) is instrumented with a liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeter for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. In the central region, a high-granularity lead/LAr electromagnetic calorimeter covers |\u03b7| < 3.2. Hadron calorimetry is based on either steel absorbers with scintillator tiles (|\u03b7| < 1.7) or copper absorbers in LAr (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2). The MS consists of three large superconducting toroids arranged with an eight-fold azimuthal coil symmetry around the calorimeters, and a system of three layers of precision gas chambers providing tracking coverage in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, while dedicated chambers allow triggering on muons in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4.

In the Type-I model, 2 couples to all quarks and leptons, whereas for Type-II, 1 couples to down-type quarks and leptons and 2 couples to up-type quarks. The 'lepton-specific' model is similar to Type-I except for the fact that the leptons couple to 1 , instead of 2 ; the 'flipped' model is similar to Type-II except that the leptons couple to 2 , instead of 1 . In all these models, the coupling of the H boson to vector bosons is proportional to cos(\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1). In the limit cos(\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1) \u2192 0 the light CP-even Higgs boson, h, is indistinguishable from a SM Higgs boson with the same mass. In the context of H \u2192 Z Z decays there is no direct coupling of the Higgs boson to leptons, and so only the Type-I and -II interpretations are presented.",

Since this analysis assumes a narrow-width signal, the 2HDM interpretation is limited to regions of parameter space where the width is less than 0.5 % of m H (significantly smaller than the detector resolution). In addition, the off-shell contribution from the light Higgs boson and its interference with the non-resonant Z Z background vary over the 2HDM parameter space as the light Higgs boson couplings are modified from their SM values. Therefore the interpretation is further limited to regions of the parameter space where the light Higgs boson couplings are enhanced by less than a factor of three from their SM values; in these regions the variation is found to have a negligible effect.",

Sherpa 1.4.1 [24] includes the effects of heavy-quark masses in its modelling of the production of W and Z bosons along with additional jets (V + jets). For this reason it is used to model these backgrounds in the hadronic qq and \u03bd\u03bdqq searches, which are subdivided based on whether the Z boson decays into b-quarks or light-flavour quarks. The Alpgen 2.14 W + jets and Z /\u03b3 * + jets samples are generated with up to five hard partons and with the partons matched to final-state particle jets [25,26]. They are used to describe these backgrounds in the other decay modes and also in the VBF channel of the qq search 2 since the additional partons in the matrix element give a better description of the VBF topology.

If a b-hadron is found, the jet is labelled as a b-jet; if not and a charmed hadron is found, the jet is labelled as a c-jet; if neither is found, the jet is labelled as a light (i.e., u-, d-, or s-quark, or gluon) jet, denoted by ' j'. For V + jets events that pass the selections for these searches, two of the additional jets are reconstructed as the hadronically-decaying Z boson candidate. Simulated V + jets events are then categorized based on the labels of these jets. If one jet is labelled as a b-jet, the event belongs to the V + b category; if not, and one of the jets is labelled as a c-jet, the event belongs to the V + c category; otherwise, the event belongs to the V + j category.

Several methods are used to tag jets originating from the fragmentation of a b-quark, including looking for tracks with a large impact parameter with respect to the primary event vertex, looking for a secondary decay vertex, and reconstructing a b-hadron \u2192 c hadron decay chain. For the qq and \u03bd\u03bdqq searches, this information is combined into a single neural-network discriminant ('MV1c'). This is a continuous variable that is larger for jets that are more like b-jets. A selection is then applied that gives an efficiency of about 70 %, on average, for identifying true b-jets, while the efficiencies for accepting c-jets or light-quark jets are 1/5 and 1/140 respectively [30,[80][81][82][83]. The \u03bd\u03bd search uses an alternative version of this discriminant, 'MV1' [80], to reject background due to top-quark production; compared with MV1c it has a smaller c-jet rejection. Tag efficiencies and mistag rates are calibrated using data. For the purpose of forming the invariant mass of the b-jets, m bb , the energies of b-tagged jets are corrected to account for muons within the jets and an additional p T -dependent correction is applied to account for biases in the response due to resolution effects.",

A small contribution from W Z decays is estimated using simulation. The electron background contributing to the ee final states comes mainly from jets misidentified as electrons, arising in three ways: light-flavour hadrons misidentified as electrons, photon conversions reconstructed as electrons, and non-isolated electrons from heavy-flavour hadronic decays. This background is estimated in a control region in which the three highestp T leptons must satisfy the full selection, with the third lepton being an electron.

The normalization of the Z + jets background is determined using the Z + jets control region from the qq channel in the final profile-likelihood fit as described in Sect. 10. To check how well this background is modelled after the \u03bd\u03bdqq selection, an alternative Z + jets control region is defined in the same way as the signal sample for m bin H = 400 GeV except that events must contain exactly two loose muons. The E miss T is calculated without including the muons and must satisfy the same requirement as for the signal: E miss no \u03bc T > 160 GeV. The Z +jets MC simulation is corrected as a function of \u03c6 j j and p T in the same manner as in the resolved ggF channel of the qq search, as described in Sect. 7.2 and Appendix B. The W + jets background estimate similarly uses a control sample with the same selection as the signal sample for m bin H = 400 GeV except that there must be exactly one loose muon and the E miss T requirement is again on E miss no \u03bc T . The simulated W + jets sample is also split into several different flavour components, as in the case of Z + jets. The normalization of the W + j j and W + cj components are free to float in the final profile-likelihood fit, and are constrained by providing as input to the fit the distribution of the MV1c b-tagging category, described in Appendix A, in the 0-b-tag and 1-b-tag control regions. Unlike the Z + jets case, the 2b-tag control region is not used in the final profile-likelihood fit to constrain the W + bj and W +hf background components since it is highly dominated by tt production. Their normalizations are instead taken from the NNLO cross section predictions with an uncertainty of 50 %. The uncertainty is determined by comparing the nominal fit value from the profile-likelihood fit with the value when including the 2-btag control region, where W + bj and W +hf are free to float; this uncertainty also covers the normalization determined in Ref. [30]. Following Ref. [30], the agreement between simulation and data for this background is improved by applying a correction to \u03c6 j j for W + j j and W + cj, with half the correction assigned as a systematic uncertainty; in the case of W + bj and W +hf, no correction is applied, but a dedicated systematic uncertainty is assigned.",

An uncertainty of 50 % is assigned to this correction. Following this correction, there is good agreement between simulation and data, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. For higher m bin H signal samples, which have tighter selections on kinematic variables than the control sample, the E miss T correction is somewhat underestimated, leading to some remaining difference between data and pre-fit simulation at high m T , as can be seen in Fig. 9c.

To estimate the uncertainty in this measurement, jets reconstructed as described in Sect. 4 are compared with jets constructed using the same clustering algorithm but using as input charged-particle tracks rather than calorimeter energy deposits. The uncertainty is found using a procedure similar to that described in Ref. [92] by studying the double ratio of masses of jets found by both the calorimeter-and track-based algorithms: R m trackcalo = r m,data trackcalo /r m,MC trackcalo , where r m,X trackcalo = m X calo /m X track , X = data or MC simulation, and m is the jet mass. The uncertainty is taken as the deviation of this quantity from unity. Studies performed on dijet samples yield a constant value of 10 % for this uncertainty. Applying the jet mass calibration derived from single jets in generic multijet samples to merged jets originating from boosted Z bosons results in a residual topology-dependent miscalibration. This effect can be bounded by an additional uncertainty of 10 %. Adding these two effects in quadrature gives a total uncertainty on the jet mass scale of 14 %. The uncertainty on the jet mass resolution has a negligible effect on the final result.",

The observed limits can be compared with expectations by generating 'Asimov' data sets, which are representative event samples that provide both the median expectation for an experimental result and its expected statistical variation in the asymptotic approximation, as described in Refs. [104,105]. When producing the Asimov data set for the expected limits, the backgroundonly hypothesis is assumed and the cross-sections for both ggF and VBF production of the heavy Higgs boson are set to zero. The remaining nuisance parameters are set to the value that maximizes the likelihood function for the observed data (profiled). When using the asymptotic procedure to calculate limits it is necessary to generate an Asimov data set both for the background-only hypothesis and for the signal hypothe-sis. When setting the observed limits, the cross-section for the other production mode not under consideration is profiled to data before generating the background-only Asimov data set.",

At low mass the search has the best sensitivity while at high  For example, the excess occurring around 200 GeV and the deficit occurring around 300 GeV arise from the (see Fig. 1) search. Deficits at higher mass are driven by fluctuations in the qq search (see Figs. 3 and 6). Figure 13 shows exclusion limits in the cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) versus tan \u03b2 plane for Type-I and Type-II 2HDMs, for a heavy Higgs boson with mass m H = 200 GeV. This m H value is chosen so the assumption of a narrow-width Higgs boson is valid over most of the parameter space, and the experimental sensitivity is at a maximum. As explained in Sect. 3.2, the range of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) and tan \u03b2 explored is limited to the region where the assumption of a heavy narrow-width Higgs boson with negligible interference is valid. When calculating the limits at a given choice of cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) and tan \u03b2, the relative rate of ggF and VBF production in the fit is set according to the prediction of the 2HDM for that parameter choice. Figure 14 shows exclusion limits as a function of the heavy Higgs boson mass m H and the parameter tan \u03b2 for cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = \u22120.1. The white regions in the exclusion plots indicate regions of parameter space not excluded by the present analysis; in these regions the cross-section predicted by the 2HDM is below the experimental sensitivity. Compared with recent studies of indirect limits [106], the exclusion presented here is considerably more stringent for Type-I with cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) < 0 and 1 < tan \u03b2 < 2, and for Type-II with 0.5 < tan \u03b2 < 2.",

The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The results of the search are interpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small compared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range considered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as 140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is found. Limits on production and decay of a heavy Higgs boson to two Z bosons are set separately for gluon-fusion and vectorboson-fusion production modes. For the combination of all decay modes, 95 % CL upper limits range from 0.53 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.008 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the gluonfusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.009 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also interpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models, with exclusion contours given in the cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) versus tan \u03b2 and m H versus tan \u03b2 planes for m H = 200 GeV. This m H value is chosen so that the assumption of a narrow-width Higgs boson is valid over most of the parameter space, and so that the experimental sensitivity is at a maximum. Compared with recent studies of indirect limits, the two-Higgs-doublet model exclusion presented here is considerably more stringent for Type-I with cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) < 0 and 1 < tan \u03b2 < 2, and for Type-II with 0.5 < tan \u03b2 < 2. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

[30]. The simulation does not model well the observed \u03c6 j j distribution in the untagged control regions for p T < 120 GeV; this is not seen at higher p T or in the tagged control region. In order to improve the modelling, the Z + j j component of the background with p T < 120 GeV is scaled by a linear function derived from the control region with no b-tagged jets at low p T with non-Z boson backgrounds subtracted. Half the value of the correction is taken as a systematic uncertainty where it is applied. In the Z +hf sample with p T < 120 GeV, the full value of the correction is taken as an uncertainty. For p T > 120 GeV, no correction is applied for any sample. In this region, a linear fit is performed to the data/MC ratio of \u03c6 j j in the untagged subchannel after subtracting the small non-Z background, and the uncertainty on the fitted slope taken as an uncertainty for all Z + jets samples. Following this correction, the description of the p T distribution in the control region with no b-tagged jets also improves, but there is still some residual discrepancy seen in the control regions that have btagged jets.

The three highestp T leptons in the event must satisfy, in order, p T > 20, 15, and 10 GeV.

The selection of lepton pairs is made separately for each of these flavour combinations; the pair with invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass is called the leading pair and its invariant mass, m 12 , must be in the range 50-106 GeV.
