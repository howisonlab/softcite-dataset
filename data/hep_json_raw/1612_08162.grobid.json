The \u03c0 0 electromagnetic transition form factor (TFF) describes the deviation of this transition from a point-like interaction. It is an input to the computation of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay rate [2], as well as the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g \u2212 2) \u03bc which at present contributes the second largest uncertainty on its Standard Model value [3].
