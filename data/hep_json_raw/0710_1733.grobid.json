Pomeron exchange allows the p and/orp to stay intact and produces a rapidity gap (a region of rapidity with no particles). Both the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations have extensive diffractive physics programs. Recent results from the CDF Collaboration are presented along with the diffractive physics plans of the D\u00d8 Collaboration.",

            "text": "The CDF diffractive physics program can be broken into two broad categories: inclusive diffraction and exclusive production. The primary goal of the inclusive diffraction program is to understand the nature of the Pomeron exchange and study the \"diffractive structure function\" 1 (F D jj ). The primary motivation for studying exclusive production at the Tevatron is to test the feasibility of using exclusive production to search for and study the Higgs boson and other new physics at the LHC 2 . In leading order QCD, exclusive production occurs through gluongluon fusion, while an additional soft gluon screens the color charge allowing the protons to remain intact 2 . Exclusive production of dijets, \u03b3\u03b3 , and Higgs bosons are possible through this mechanism. Exclusive production can also occur through two-photon exchange: \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 .",

The SD data sample is collected by triggering on the leading antiproton in the roman pot spectrometer 3 plus at least one jet in the central detector. The ND data sample is collected using just the central jet trigger. The ratio of the SD to ND dijet production is shown in Fig. 1 (top) as a function of the Bjorken-x (x Bj ). The figure shows R N D SD for different values of Q 2 , where Q 2 is defined as the square of the mean dijet E T . In the range 100 < Q 2 < 10000 GeV 2 there is no significant Q 2 dependence observed, indicating that the evolution of the Pomeron could be similar to that of the proton.",

Figure 4(top) shows that this suppression is found in the data and compares it to the expectations from the previous study. The figure shows that the two approaches agree. The cross section of exclusive dijet production has been measured by multiplying the cross section of the DPE sample by the fraction of exclusive events in the sample and accounting for acceptances.
