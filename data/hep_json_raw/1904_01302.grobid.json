Theoretical calculations suggest that the off-diagonal cumulants of conserved charges along with the diagonal cumulants can help better constrain the freeze-out parameters and, therefore, help to map the QCD phase diagram. In this proceeding, we briefly outline the recent STAR measurements [1] on the second-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton, and net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC BES-I program in the energy range of \u221a s NN = 7.7-200 GeV. The measured cumulant ratios are compared to the predictions from both thermal (HRG) and non-thermal (UrQMD) models.",

            "text": "The major goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiment is to study the formation of a new form matter, called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Over the last two decades, a number of possible evidences for the QGP phase has been established experimentally. Currently a large community of physicists are exploring the QCD phase structure and trying to find a possible signature of the QCD critical point. One of the most community used method to explore phase diagram is to study the event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges, such as net electric charge (Q), net baryon number (B) and net strangeness number (S) in the heavy-ion collisions over a wide range of energy [2,3]. It is proposed that the higher-order cumulants of the net-multiplicity distributions are related to the higher order thermodynamic susceptibilities of corresponding conserved charges in QCD and expected to diverge near the critical point [2,4]. Over the past few years, STAR and PHENIX experiments at RHIC published results on the diagonal cumulants (c n \u03b1 ) of net-electric charge [5,6], net-proton (p, an experimental proxy for net-baryon) [7,8] and net-kaon (k, an experimental proxy for net-strangeness) [9] multiplicity distributions. Similarly, off-diagonal cumulants (c m,n \u03b1,\u03b2 ) of Q, p and k are related to the mixed susceptibilities that carry the correlation between different conserved charges [1]. Lattice QCD and hadron resonance gas model (HRG) calculations show that normalized baryon-strange correlations, that can be expressed as off-diagonal to diagonal cumulant (",

The minimum-bias (MB) events are analyzed with the requirement that the position of the primary vertex along z-direction (V z ) was reconstructed within \u00b130 cm of the center of the STAR detector and within 2 cm on the transverse plane of the beam axis. The number of events analyzed at each energy after applying all event selections criteria is listed in Table 1   All charged tracks used in this analysis are required to be within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.5, and the transverse momentum range 0.4 < p T < 1.6 GeV/c. To reduce the contamination from the secondary charged particles, only primary tracks are selected within a distance of closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex of less than 1 cm. The main detectors used in this analysis are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Time of Flight (TOF). The particle identification (PID) is done with a common acceptance: 0.4 < p T < 1.6 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.5. Within this range, the purities of K \u00b1 and p(p) identification is estimated to be 98-99%. The collision centrality for this analysis is defined using uncorrected charged particle multiplicity measured within a pseudorapidity range of 0.5 < |\u03b7| < 1.0 in the TPC detector. This way we exclude the particles from the analysis region to determine the centrality in order to suppress autocorrelation effects [15]. We present the results for nine centrality bins, 0-5% (most central), 10-20%, ... , 70-80% (most peripheral) as a function of average number of participating nucleons ( N part ) estimated using a Monte Carlo Glauber model [16]. The cumulants and their ratios were calculated as a function of the reference multiplicity and then averaged over the centrality bins to suppress the volume fluctuations over wide centrality bins [17,18]. We use embedding Monte Carlo simulation techniques to obtain the efficiencies and an algebra based on binomial detector response to efficiency correction [19,20,21]. The statistical uncertainty estimation is based on the numerical error propagation method of multivariate cumulants [22]. The systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying different track quality cuts, tracking efficiency and conditions for particle identification.",

We find a linearly increasing trend as expected from a scaling, predicted by the central limit theorem. In a given centrality, the width of net-proton distribution decreases as a function of beam energy in the range \u221a s NN = 7.7-39 GeV and then increases at top RHIC energies [8]. This is because of baryon transport that has a strong beam energy dependence.   Figure 2 shows the efficiency corrected second-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton, net-kaon multiplicity distributions for Au+Au collisions at eight colliding energies. The off-diagonal cumulants between net-charge\u2212net-kaon (\u03c3 1,1 Q,k ) and that of net-charge\u2212net-proton (\u03c3 1,1 Q,p ) increase with centrality. On the contrary, there is a growing anti-correlation behaviour observed between net-proton and net-kaon (\u03c3 1,1 p,k ) with centrality at \u221a s NN > 19.6 GeV.  and C Q,p = \u03c3 1,1 Q,p /\u03c3 2 p (top to bottom) as a function of beam energy for most central (0-5%) and peripheral (70-80%) collisions. These cumulant ratios are designed to eliminate the effect of system volume. An excess correlation is observed in C Q,p and C Q,k in 0-5% most central in comparison to the peripheral collisions. The values of C Q,p and C Q,k are observed to increase with beam energy, and this increasing trend cannot be explained by the HRG and UrQMD model calculations. It is observed that the normalized p-k correlation (C p,k ) is positive at the lowest BES energy and negative at higher energies. For 0-5% top central bins, C p,k changes sign around 19.6 GeV.",

Significant excess correlation is observed in C Q,p and C Q,k in central in comparison with peripheral events. Both HRG and UrQMD model underpredict the data and cannot describe the increasing with beam energy trends of C Q,p and C Q,k . The value of C p,k in 0-5% central collision is found to be negative at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV and positive at \u221a s NN = 7.7 GeV. The measurements of the full second-order cumulant matrix elements of net-p/k/Q multiplicity distributions as a function of centrality and beam energy will improve the estimation of freeze-out parameters by theoretical calculations and that help to map the QCD phase diagram. For more details of this analysis we refer the readers to Ref. [1].",
