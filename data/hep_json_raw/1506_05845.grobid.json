A recent measurement of B + \u2192 K + l + l \u2212 decays [1], where l represents e or \u00b5, hinted at a possible violation of e-\u00b5 universality in second order weak interactions that involve neutral and charged currents. The branching ratio of pion decays, R e/\u00b5 = \u0393(\u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd(\u03b3))/\u0393(\u03c0 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd(\u03b3)), where (\u03b3) indicates inclusion of associated radiative decays, has been calculated in the SM with extraordinary precision to be R SM e/\u00b5 = (1.2352 \u00b1 0.0002) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [2,3]. Comparison with the latest experimental values, R exp e/\u00b5 = (1.2265 \u00b1 0.0034(stat) \u00b1 0.0044(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [4] and R exp e/\u00b5 = (1.2346 \u00b1 0.0035(stat) \u00b1 0.0036(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [5], has provided one of the best tests of e-\u00b5 universality in weak interactions for the charged current, at the 0.2 % level giving sensitivity to new physics beyond the SM up to mass scales of O(500) TeV [3]. Examples of new physics probed include R-parity violating SUSY [6], extra leptons [7] and leptoquarks [8]. In this paper, we present the first results from the PIENU experiment, which improve on the precision of R exp e/\u00b5 and the test of e-\u00b5 universality.",

Special data, using a simplified setup consisting of T2 and WC1-3, taken with a 70-MeV/c positron beam at various entrance angles were used to determine the response function. In order to obtain the fraction of the \u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd events below E cut for the full setup, the difference in the detector geometry, the \u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd angular distributions, and radiative pion decays were estimated using simulation.

The resulting backgroundsuppressed positron energy spectrum is shown by the shaded histogram in Fig. 2. The remaining background was subtracted from the spectrum using the fact that the background-suppressed spectrum in a low-energy region contained a negligible \u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd tail contribution. The area of the low-energy region was scaled to the full region (< E cut ) using the known background distribution. This resulted in a lower bound of 1.48 \u00b1 0.07(stat)\u00b1 0.08(syst) %. Since the total energy cut used in the suppression method tended to remove \u03c0 + \u2192 e + \u03bd events with Bhabha scattering which resulted in larger energy deposit in B3, a correction of 1.48\u00b10.02(syst) % obtained by simulation was added to the tail correction.
