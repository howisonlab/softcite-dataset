The OSQAR photon regeneration experiment looks for \"light shining through a wall\" from the quantum oscillation of optical photons into \"weakly interacting sub-eV particles,\" such as axion or axionlike particles (ALPs) in a 9 T transverse magnetic field over a length of 2 \u00d7 14.3 m. In 2014, this experiment was run with an outstanding sensitivity, using an 18.5 W continuous wave laser emitting in the green at the single wavelength of 532 nm. No regenerated photons have been detected after the wall, pushing the limits for the existence of axions and ALPs down to an unprecedented level for such type of laboratory experiment. The diphoton couplings of possible pseudoscalar and scalar ALPs can be constrained in the nearly massless limit to be less than 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV \u22121 and 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV \u22121 , respectively, at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Possible extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics are not restricted to the high-energy frontier. There is also a growing interest for the search of weakly interacting sub-eV particles (WISPs) with much weaker interactions and masses below the eV. One emblematic example is the axion, a pseudoscalar boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global chiral symmetry U\u00f01\u00de A postulated to dynamically solve the strong CP problem [1][2][3]. Axions and axionlike particles (ALPs) are predicted in supersymmetric theories [4], in string theory [5,6], and in the conformal Standard Model [7]. ALPs can be scalar as well as pseudoscalar and theorized to couple to the SM through a variety of mechanisms, giving rise, in particular, to a two-photon vertex. WISPs also include light bosons of gauge groups under which the SM particles are not charged (hidden sectors), which may interact with the SM through gravity, kinetic mixing, or higher order quantum processes [8]. The interest aroused by WISPs goes beyond particle physics. As earlier hypothesized for the axion [9], they provide alternative candidates for dark matter [10][11][12]. Moreover, they might explain a number of astrophysical puzzles, such as the Universe transparency to very high-energy photons (>100 GeV) [13], the anomalous white dwarf cooling [14], or the recently discovered gamma-ray excesses in galaxy clusters [15]. In contrast to weakly interacting massive particles, which can be searched for at TeV colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the detection of WISPs requires to have recourse to dedicated low-energy experiments. Several methodologies exploiting the existence of a diphoton coupling have been proposed based on lasers, microwave cavities, strong electromagnetic fields, or torsion balances [16,17].",

            "text": "The OSQAR (Optical Search for QED Vacuum Birefringence, Axions, and Photon Regeneration) experiment at CERN is at the forefront of this low-energy frontier of particle/astroparticle physics. It combines the simultaneous use of high magnetic fields with laser beams in distinct experiments. One of its setups uses the \"light shining through a wall\" (LSW) method for the search of the ALPs [18]. A pioneering work in this line excluded ALPs with a diphoton coupling constant g A\u03b3\u03b3 larger than 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 GeV \u22121 for masses below 10 \u22123 eV [19]. These exclusion limits were later extended by other LSW experiments to g A\u03b3\u03b3 > 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV \u22121 for masses below 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV [20] and more recently tightened to g A\u03b3\u03b3 > 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV \u22121 for masses below 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV [21]. New results are here reported, obtained from the 2014 data-taking campaign of the OSQAR LSW experiment. Compared to the previous experimental setups of OSQAR [21,22], a more powerful laser source and a detector with higher sensitivity have been used. In addition, an improved method of data analysis has been implemented.",

The first is the transparency of the WISPs to photons barriers, owing to the weakness of the interactions of the WISPs with the particles of the SM. The second is the photon-to-WISP and WISP-to-photon quantum oscillation, which would arise from the interactions of WISPs with photons [18,23,24]. In the case of the sub-eV ALPs, the method benefits from their two-photon vertex, inducing oscillations with optical photons in a transverse magnetic field. Such a field can be represented as a sea of virtual photons, whose interaction with real photons (respectively ALPs) can produce real ALPs (respectively photons). The mechanism is similar to the Primakov process of the production of neutral mesons by high-energy photons in a strong electric field [25].

A beam expander telescope was used to reduce the laser beam divergence. The photon beam is linearly polarized with a vertical orientation parallel to the magnetic field for the search of PS-ALPs. A \u03bb=2 wave plate with antireflective (AR) coating layers was inserted at the laser exit in order to align the photon polarization in the perpendicular direction for the search of S-ALPs. The laser beam at the exit of the second magnet aperture was focused by an optical lens on a thermoelectric cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) with an AR-coated window (DU934P-BEX2-DD from Andor Technology Ltd.). The CCD chip has an active area of 13.3 \u00d7 13.3 mm 2 and is composed by a 2D array of 1024 \u00d7 1024 square pixels of size 13 \u00d7 13 \u03bcm 2 . The laser beam was focused at 95% on an area covering not more than four pixels. The CCD was cooled down to the temperature range [\u221295\u00b0C, \u221292\u00b0C].

The read-out noise was determined at 2.5e \u2212 rms=pixel from frames recorded in minimal time with closed shutters. These measured CCD parameters are in agreement with those provided by the manufacturer. The overall photon detection efficiency was explicitly measured to \u03b7 \u00bc 0.56 AE 0.02 analog-to-digital unit (ADU)/photon, taking into account the losses coming from optical elements including windows, plates, lens, CCD quantum efficiency of 0.88 at 532 nm, and sensitivity of 1.3e \u2212 =ADU.

The beam spot displacement is unidirectional, with no oscillation observed after the exposure time of a full run, i.e., after 2 \u00d7 5400 s \u00fe 100 s \u00bc 10900 s. The beam spot sizes before and after each experimental run are obtained from least-squares fits with a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution.

If the laser positions before and after a run do not coincide, all pixels within a 2\u03c3 run orthogonal distance along a straight line between the final and initial positions are added to the signal region. An illustrative example is provided in Fig. 2. It follows that the number S of pixels that defines the signal region can vary from run to run (Table II). A cumulated count N i can be associated to each run-i, by adding the counts collected during the exposure time of 2 \u00d7 5400 s for ALPs detection on all the pixels of the signal region, once this one is carefully determined.

            "text": "One of the advantages of a small and well-defined signal region is the possibility to use the remaining pixels, which are not exposed to possible ALP signals, to fully characterize the background without repeating dedicated background acquisition runs [21,22]. These remaining pixels are clustered in size and shape that correspond to the signal region. Cumulated counts n ij are obtained for each cluster j in the background region of each run-i, by adding the counts collected on all the pixels of the chosen cluster, similar to the cumulated count N i of the signal region. The distribution of the n ij for a given run-i then provides an estimate of the expected background contribution to N i . As it is well known for CCDs, the width of this distribution arises mainly from two independent sources, namely, dark counts that increase with exposure times and read-out noise that arises from the analog-digital conversion process of the read-out system. Before analyzing the cumulative counts, three corrections have been applied to each recorded frame pair of 2 \u00d7 5400 s. The first one aims to correct long wavelength distortions of the spatial distribution of the background arising from the minor heterogenity in the cooling of the CCD chip. Corrections of these background drifts are achieved by median filtering. The objective of the second correction is to reduce the so-called fixed pattern noise evolving from possibly unequal pixel biases. As this noise manifests only during read-out and is independent of the exposure time, it has been estimated by capturing dark frames (i.e., shutter closed) with the minimal exposure time (10 \u22125 s in our case). Ten frames have been recorded under these conditions and have been averaged pixelwise to define a bias frame, which is subtracted from every frame used in the data analyses. This correction also subtracts the general constant offset of about 3300 counts on each pixel imprinted by the chip in each frame of 5400 s. The last correction step removes those pixels, which were hit by cosmic rays, using a short wavelength filtering process. Whenever a pixel count exceeds the significant threshold of the distribution of pixel counts in the background region, this pixel is rejected together with its nearest neighbors. In case the signal region is hit by a cosmic ray, the overall frame is rejected.",

A slightly better detection limit can be obtained by rejecting the few runs with a too-large size of signal region but at the statistical cost of the counts inherent to the corresponding decrease of the total exposure time.
