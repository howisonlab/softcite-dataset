The value obtained for the slope parameter of the \u03c0 0 electromagnetic transition form factor, a\u03c0 = 0.030 \u00b1 0.010tot, is in agreement with existing measurements of this decay and with recent theoretical calculations.

For the meson A, QED predicts a specific strong dependence of its decay rate on the dilepton invariant mass, m ll = q. A deviation from the pure QED dependence, caused by the actual electromagnetic structure of the meson A, is formally described by its e/m TFF [13]. The Vector-Meson-Dominance (VMD) model [14] can be used to describe the coupling of the virtual photon \u03b3 * to the meson A via an intermediate virtual vector meson V . This mechanism is especially strong in the timelike (the energy transfer larger than the momentum transfer) momentum-transfer region, (2m l ) 2 < q 2 < m 2 A , where a resonant behavior near q 2 = m 2 V of the virtual photon arises because the virtual vector meson is approaching the mass shell [13], or even reaching it, as it is in the case of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 l + l \u2212 \u03b3 decay. Experimentally, timelike TFFs can be determined by measuring the actual decay rate of A \u2192 l + l \u2212 \u03b3 as a function of the dilepton invariant mass m ll = q, normalizing this dependence to the partial decay width \u0393(A \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), and then taking the ratio to the pure QED dependence for the decay rate of A \u2192 \u03b3 * \u03b3 \u2192 l + l \u2212 \u03b3.",

So far, the most accurate slope-parameter value obtained from measuring \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays, a \u03c0 = 0.025 \u00b1 0.014 stat \u00b1 0.026 syst [22], has uncertainties one order of magnitude larger than the value from CELLO [20]. This timelike measurement is based on the analysis of just 54 \u2022 10 3 \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays, with radiative corrections according to Ref. [19], and does not provide any |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m ee )| 2 data points. The results of the present work are going to improve the experimental situation for the timelike \u03c0 0 TFF, with the experimental statistic of \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays larger by one order of magnitude, compared to Ref. [22]. Further improvement in the timelike region is expected to be made by NA62, the preliminary result of which, a \u03c0 = 0.0370 \u00b1 0.0053 stat \u00b1 0.0036 syst , was based on 1.05 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays observed [23]. The latest NA62 value for the slope parameter, which appeared after this paper was submitted for publication, updated their result to a \u03c0 = 0.0368 \u00b1 0.0051 stat \u00b1 0.0025 syst = 0.0368 \u00b1 0.0057 tot , based on 1.11 \u2022 10 6 \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays observed [24].",

Measuring \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 is challenging because of the smallness of the TFF effect in the region of very low momentum transfer; the magnitude of |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 | 2 is expected to reach only a 5% enhancement above the pure QED dependence at m ee = 120 MeV/c 2 . Thus, such a measurement requires high statistics to reach a statistical accuracy comparable with the expected TFF effect. Also, the magnitude of systematic uncertainties caused by the acceptance determination, background subtraction, and experimental resolutions needs to be small. The advantage of measuring \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 with the A2 setup at MAMI is that \u03c0 0 mesons can be produced in the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p, which has a very large cross section at energies close to the \u2206(1232) state, and there is no background from other physical reactions at these energies. The only background for \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays are \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays with a photon converting into an e + e \u2212 pair in the material in front of electromagnetic calorimeters.",

Bremsstrahlung photons, produced by the beam electrons in a radiator (100-\u00b5m-thick diamond and 10-\u00b5m Cu for Run-I and Run-II, respectively) and collimated by a Pb collimator (with diameter 3 and 4 mm for Run-I and Run-II, respectively), were incident on a 10-cm-long liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) target located in the center of the CB. The total amount of material around the LH 2 target, including the Kapton cell and the 1-mmthick carbon-fiber beamline, was equivalent to 0.8% of a radiation length X 0 . In the present measurement, it was essential to keep the material budget as low as possible to minimize the background from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays with conversion of the photons into e + e \u2212 pairs.",

A multi-wire proportional chamber, MWPC, also shown in this figure (which consists of two cylindrical MWPCs inside each other), was not used in the present measurements because of its relatively low efficiency for detecting e +/\u2212 . In Run-I, the energies of the incident photons were analyzed from 140 up to 798 MeV by detecting the postbremsstrahlung electrons in the Glasgow tagged-photon spectrometer (Glasgow tagger) [40][41][42], and from 216 up to 1448 MeV in Run-II. The uncertainty in the energy of the tagged photons is mainly determined by the segmentation of tagger focal-plane detector in combination with the energy of the MAMI electron beam used in the experiments. Increasing the MAMI energy increases the energy range covered by the spectrometer and also has the corresponding effect on the uncertainty in E \u03b3 . For the MAMI energy settings of 855 and 1557 MeV, this uncertainty was about \u00b11 MeV and \u00b12 MeV, respectively. More details on the tagger energy calibration and uncertainties in the energies can be found in Ref. [45].",

If one photon deposits some energy in the PID, then this e/m shower, together with the recoil proton, could be misidentified as an e + e \u2212 pair. Such background does not mimic the \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 peak, but the suppression of this background improves the signal-to-background ratio, which is important for more reliable fitting of the signal peak above the remaining background. Similar background can come from the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 0 p \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3p events themselves when one of the leptons failed to be detected, and the recoil proton was misidentified with this lepton. The background from the misidentification of the recoil proton with e +/\u2212 can be suppressed by the analysis of energy losses, dE/dx, in the PID elements. To reflect the actual differential energy deposit dE/dx in the PID, the energy signal from each element, ascribed to either e + or e \u2212 , was multiplied by the sine of the polar angle of the corresponding particle, the magnitude of which was taken from the kinematicfit output. All PID elements were calibrated so that the e +/\u2212 peak position matched the corresponding peak in the MC simulation.

Possible systematic uncertainties due to the dE/dx cuts were checked via the stability of the results after narrowing the dE/dx range for selecting e +/\u2212 . The experimental dE/dx resolution of the PID for e +/\u2212 in Run-I and the comparison of it with the MC simulation is illustrated in Fig. 2. Figures 2(a) and (b) show (for the experimental data and the MC simulation, respectively) two-dimensional plots of the e +/\u2212 dE/dx value of the PID versus the energy of the corresponding clusters in the CB. As seen, there is no dE/dx dependence of e +/\u2212 on their energy in the CB, and applying cuts just on a dE/dx value is sufficient for suppressing backgrounds caused by misidentifying protons as e +/\u2212 . The comparison of the experimental e +/\u2212 dE/dx distributions with the MC simulation is depicted in Fig. 2(c). A small difference in the tails of the e +/\u2212 peak can mostly be explained by some background remaining in the experimental spectrum. This background includes events with misidentified recoil protons, photons converting before reaching the crystal surface, and also a small fraction from accidental hits in the PID. The dE/dx distribution from the recoil protons for the selected four-cluster events is shown in Fig. 2(c) by the red line, illustrating a quite small overlapping range of e +/\u2212 and the protons. Typical PID cuts, which were tested, varied from requiring dE/dx < 3.7 MeV to dE/dx < 2.7 MeV to suppress background events with misidentified protons, showing no systematic effects in the final results.",

Another background was caused by random coincidences of the tagger counts with the experimental trigger; its subtraction was carried out by using event samples for which all coincidences were random (see Refs.

The results for |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 were obtained from those initial numbers of \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays by taking into account the total number of \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays produced in the same data sets [33,34] and the [QED(m ee )] term from Eq. (1) after radiative corrections according to the calculations of Ref. [18]. The uncertainty in an individual |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 value from a particular fit was based on the uncertainty in the number of decays determined by this fit (i.e, the uncertainty in the area under the Gaussian). The systematic uncertainties in the |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 values were estimated for each individual m(e + e \u2212 ) bin by repeating its fitting procedure several times after refilling the m(e + e \u2212 \u03b3) spectra with different combinations of selection criteria, which were used to improve the signal-to-background ratio, or after slight changes in the parametrization of the background under the signal peak. The changes in selection criteria included cuts on the kinematic-fit CL (such as 1% 2%, 5%, and 10%), different cuts on PID dE/dx, and switching on and off the requirement for both e + and e \u2212 to be identified by different PID elements. The requirement of making several fits for each m(e + e \u2212 ) bin provided a check on the stability of the |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 results. The average of the results of all fits made for one bin was then used to obtain final TFF values that were more reliable than the results based on the fit with the largest number of \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays, corresponding to the initial selection criteria. Because the fits for a given m(e + e \u2212 ) bin with different selection criteria or different background parametrizations were based on the same initial data sample, the corresponding |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 results were correlated and could not be considered as independent measurements for calculating the uncertainty in the averaged TFF value. Thus, this uncertainty was taken from the fit with the largest number of \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 decays in the m(e + e \u2212 ) bin, which was a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the averaged TFF value. The systematic uncertainty in the averaged |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 value was taken as the root mean square of the results from all fits made for this bin. The total uncertainty in this |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m e + e \u2212 )| 2 value was calculated by adding in quadrature its fit (partially reflecting experimental statistics in the bin) and systematic uncertainties.

However, the magnitude of the deviation is well within the experimental uncertainties. In addition, attempts to fit the present data points with Eq.

The results of this work also include |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (m ee )| 2 data points with their total uncertainties, which allows a more fair comparison of the experimental data with theoretical calculations or the use of those data in model-independent fits. A much more precise measurement of the \u03c0 0 TFF at low momentum transfer with the Dalitz decay \u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3, which has already been planned by the A2 Collaboration, hopefully will reach the accuracy needed to constrain calculations that estimate the pion-exchange term, a \u03c0 0 \u00b5 , to the HLbL scattering contribution to (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 .",
