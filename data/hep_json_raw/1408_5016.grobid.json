The effective weak mixing angle is extracted from the forward-backward charge asymmetry as a function of the invariant mass around the Z boson pole. The measured value of sin 2 \u03b8 \u2113 eff = 0.23147 \u00b1 0.00047 is the most precise measurement from light quark interactions to date, with a precision close to the best LEP and SLD results. The weak mixing angle sin 2 \u03b8 W is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model (SM). It describes the relative strength of the axial-vector couplings g f A to the vector couplings g f V in neutral-current interactions of a Z boson to fermions f with Lagrangian",

The weak mixing angle, which is extracted from A F B as a function of M ee , depends strongly on the position of the peak value of M ee . Therefore, it is critical to have a precise electron energy measurement and a consistent measured peak value of M ee from different regions of the detector across various Tevatron running conditions. In Ref. [7], an overall scale factor was applied to simulations to model the detector response for electron energy depositions, where the scale factor is determined by comparing the M ee spectrum in data and MC, yielding a large uncertainty due to background estimation and detector resolution. In this analysis, a new energy calibration method is applied to the data and the MC separately. The energy mea-surement depends not only on the \u03b7 det , but also on the instantaneous luminosity [17]. For CC electrons, an instantaneous luminosity-dependent scale factor (\u03b1 CC L ) and an \u03b7 det -dependent scale factor (\u03b1 CC \u03b7 ) are applied to the electron energy. For EC electrons in addition to the scale factors \u03b1 EC L and \u03b1 EC \u03b7 , an \u03b7 det -dependent offset \u03b2 EC \u03b7 is introduced to model the \u03b7 det dependence of the electron energy. All correction factors are determined by scaling the peak of the M ee distribution as a function of instantaneous luminosity and \u03b7 det to be consistent with the Z boson mass measured by LEP (M Z = 91.1875 GeV) [1]. The CC correction factors are tuned with the CC-CC events. To remove one degree of freedom, \u03b2 EC \u03b7 is expressed as a function of \u03b1 EC \u03b7 , and the relationship is measured with the CC-EC events. The values of \u03b1 EC \u03b7 and \u03b2 EC \u03b7 (\u03b1 EC \u03b7 ) are fitted using the EC-EC events. After the calibration, the standard deviation \u03b4M of the M ee peak values in different \u03b7 det regions is \u2248 20 MeV. Various closure tests are performed to check the validity of the calibration procedure. For example, an extra \u03b7 detdependent offset is applied to the corrected energy and fixed by performing the calibration again. The extra offset is found to be consistent with \u03b4M . The ratio of \u03b4M to M Z is propagated into the uncertainty of the sin 2 \u03b8 \u2113 eff measurement to estimate the systematic uncertainty arising from the energy calibration.",

The scale factors of the electron identification efficiency between the MC and the data are measured using the tag-and-probe method [19] and applied to the MC distributions as functions of p T and \u03b7 det . The simulation is further corrected for higher-order effects not included in pythia by reweighting the MC events at the generator level in two dimensions (p T and rapidity y of the Z boson) to match resbos [20] predictions. In addition, next-tonext-to-leading order QCD corrections are applied as a function of M Z [20,21]. The distribution of the instantaneous luminosity and the z coordinate of the pp collision vertices are also weighted to match those in the data. Since A F B is defined as a ratio of numbers of events, many small uncertainties cancel out. Only the electron selection efficiency scale factor in these additional corrections contributes significantly to the final uncertainty. The charge of the particle track matched to the EM cluster is used to determine if the EM cluster is associated to an electron or positron and to classify the event as forward or backward. The charge misidentification probability is given by the number of pp \u2192 Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 events reconstructed with same-sign as a proportion of the total number of pp \u2192 Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 events. The probabilities are measured in data and MC. The charge of electrons and positrons reconstructed in the MC is randomly changed to match the misidentification probability in the data averaged over p T spectrum of electrons. In the CC region the average charge misidentification rate in data is about 0.3%, whereas in the EC region it varies from 1% at |\u03b7 det | = 1.5 to 10% at |\u03b7 det | = 3.0. The statistical uncertainty of the measured charge misidentification rate is included as a systematic uncertainty.",

The main contribution is from multijet events, in which jets are misreconstructed as electrons, and is estimated from data. The multijet production from the proton anti-proton initial state produces jets, and hence fake electrons, nearly symmetrically with respect to the forward and backward hemispheres [7,22]. Multijet events are selected by reversing some of the electron selection cuts to study the differential distributions of the multijet background, which are different from the real multijet background that passes all the electron selections. Therefore, a correction factor is applied as a function of electron p T , given by the ratios of the efficiencies for EM-like jets (which are selected in a multijet-enriched data sample and pass all the electron selections) and \"reverse-selected\" jets. The normalization of the multijet background is determined by fitting the sum of the M ee distributions of multijet events and the signal MC events to the distribution from the selected data events. The W +jets, Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , diboson (W W and W Z), \u03b3\u03b3 and tt backgrounds are estimated using the pythia MC simulations.

This weighted combination provides cancellation of asymmetries due to variations in detector response and acceptance with \u03b7 det and p T . The weak mixing angle is extracted from the backgroundsubtracted A F B spectrum in the regions 75 < M ee < 115 GeV for CC-CC and CC-EC events, and 81 < M ee < 97 GeV for EC-EC events by comparing the data to simulated A F B templates corresponding to different input values of sin 2 \u03b8 W . The mass window for EC-EC events is narrower to take into account the differences in track reconstruction and energy measurement. at the generator level to different Born-level sin 2 \u03b8 W predictions. The A F B distribution is negligibly sensitive to the effect of QED final state radiation because most of these radiated photons are emitted co-linearly with the electron and are reconstructed as one single EM object by the detector. The background-subtracted A F B distribution and the pythia prediction with the fitted sin 2 \u03b8 W are shown in Fig. 1. The results of the fits for different event categories, with statistical and systematic uncertainties, are listed in Table I. The uncertainties on sin 2 \u03b8 W are dominated by the limited data sample. CC-EC events are the most sensitive to the weak mixing angle due to the larger variation of A F B with mass in that kinematic region. The systematic uncertainties due to the electron energy calibration and resolution smearing, the estimation of the backgrounds, the charge misidentification rate and the identification efficiency are also dominated by the limited data sample. We estimate the systematic uncertainty on the measured sin 2 \u03b8 W due to instrumental asymmetries that remain after combining the luminosityweighted solenoid and toroid samples to be \u00b10.00001",
