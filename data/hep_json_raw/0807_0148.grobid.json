Recently, evidence for mixing in this system has been obtained [1,2,3]. However, whether the effect observed is due to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) theory or due to new physics (NP) has yet to be determined and will require further measurements to resolve. One possible measurement sensitive to NP is that of a CP asymmetry in D 0 decays to Cabibbo-suppressed (CS) final states [4]. Within the SM such an asymmetry is predicted to be very small ( 0.1%), but within NP scenarios it can be substantial ( 1%) [4,5].",

Possible systematic uncertainties arise due to the difference in signal shapes of D 0 andD 0 candidates and due to the possible difference in the background between the signal window and sideband. The former source can introduce an additional asymmetry if the signal window is not sufficiently wide. We observe small but significant differences in the q signal shape of the tagged samples. By studying the normalized (in order to asses only the effect of the shape difference) q distributions of the tagged D 0 (D 0 ) \u2192 K\u03c0 samples we estimate the systematic uncertainty of this source to be 0.02% (0.04%) for the KK (\u03c0\u03c0) sample. To account for a possible difference in backgrounds we vary the position of the sideband. We find 0.01% (KK) and 0.03% (\u03c0\u03c0) variations in the result. Background due to a correctly reconstructed D 0 candidate combined with a random slow pion is not removed by the M sideband subtraction. Its fraction (0.6%) is estimated from the tuned MC simulation. The possible asymmetry induced by this type of background is estimated from the q sideband to be at most 0.03%. The second source of systematic error is the slow pion efficiency correction. The statistical errors on A \u03c0 \u01eb (p \u03c0s , cos \u03b8 \u03c0s ) contribute an uncertainty of 0.09%. The impact of binning of the slow pion asymmetry is studied by producing maps with three different choices of bin sizes (10 \u00d7 10, 20 \u00d7 20, 50 \u00d7 50 for A untag rec , and 5 \u00d7 5, 10 \u00d7 10, 20 \u00d7 20 for A \u03c0 \u01eb ) and repeating the procedure for extracting A CP . We find 0.03% (KK) and 0.02% (\u03c0\u03c0) variations in the result. The minimum required number of events per bin is varied from 100 to 10000, and the resulting variation in A CP is 0.04% (0.03%) for the KK (\u03c0\u03c0) sample. The third source of systematic uncertainty is the A CP extraction procedure. By varying the binning in | cos \u03b8 * | we obtain a 0.03% variation in the result. We change the treatment of the running periods with 3-and 4-layer SVD configuration; we find an 0.01% (0.02%) change in the result for the KK (\u03c0\u03c0) sample.",
