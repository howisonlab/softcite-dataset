The measurement is performed using the forward silicon vertex detector and central vertex detector at PHENIX, which provide precise tracking and distance-of-closest-approach determinations, enabling the statistical separation of J/\u03c8 due to Bmeson decays from prompt J/\u03c8. The measured value of F B\u2192J/\u03c8 is 8.1%\u00b12.3% (stat)\u00b11.9% (syst) for J/\u03c8 with transverse momenta 0 < pT < 5 GeV/c and rapidity 1.2 < |y| < 2.2. The measured fraction F B\u2192J/\u03c8 at PHENIX is compared to values measured by other experiments at higher center of mass energies and to fixed-order-next-to-leading-logarithm and color-evaporation-model predictions. The bb cross section per unit rapidity (d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192bb)) extracted from the obtained F B\u2192J/\u03c8 and the PHENIX inclusive J/\u03c8 cross section measured at 200 GeV scaled with colorevaporation-model calculations, at the mean B hadron rapidity y = \u00b11.7 in 510 GeV p+p collisions, is 3.63 +1.92 \u22121.70 \u00b5b. It is consistent with the fixed-order-next-to-leading-logarithm calculations.",

            "text": "The measurement of bottom (B) mesons in p+p and p+p collisions is of interest to constrain the total bottom cross section as well as test our understanding of bottom quark production mechanisms and hadronization. There are extensive direct measurements of various B mesons, as well as measurements of B \u2192 J/\u03c8 contributions over a broad range in J/\u03c8 transverse momentum and rapidity from the Tevatron in p+p at \u221a s = 1.8, 1.96 TeV [1][2][3] and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in p+p at \u221a s = 7-13 TeV [4][5][6][7][8]. In contrast, measurements from UA1 in p+p at \u221a s = 630 GeV [9] are statistically limited and only for p T (J/\u03c8) > 5 GeV/c. Adding new measurements at lower energies and covering different kinematic regions is valuable for testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations and constraining production mechanisms. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) provides p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200, 500 and 510 GeV, which extends the kinematic reach for bottom measurements. At these smaller energies, bottom production is dominated by gluongluon fusion, while higher energy bottom production contains a larger fraction of flavor excitation and gluon splitting processes [10]. The STAR experiment measured B \u2192 J/\u03c8 at midrapidity for J/\u03c8 p T > 5 GeV/c in p+p at \u221a s = 200 GeV [11]. Our measurement at forward rapidity and p T within 0-5 GeV/c in \u221a s = 510 GeV p+p collisions at PHENIX can provide the validation of parton distribution functions (PDF) in a different gluon fractional momentum range 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 < x Bj < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 . As the highest center of mass energy accessed by RHIC collisions, bottom measurements at \u221a s = 510 GeV will also help us understand the energy dependence from RHIC to LHC energies.",

The term \"prompt\" is in contrast to \"nonprompt\", which specifically refers to production through more long-lived decay parent hadrons (i.e. B mesons). The nonprompt J/\u03c8 component that comes from the decay of B mesons, provides a clean channel to measure B-meson yields.

During the minimization, tracks with large displacements are removed to improve the fidelity of the final vertex reconstruction. The vertex determination in each event is strongly affected by the small VTX and FVTX track multiplicities in p+p collisions. Events containing bb decay products can also skew the vertex determination. Therefore, in this analysis we take advantage of the beam stability in x and y during the fill (5-12 hours) and use the measured average x and y position of all events in the fill to determine our primary x and y vertex. The spread of the primary x and y vertex position based on the beam spot size is around 80 \u00b5m in RMS. The z position is still determined on an event-by-event basis for events that have a VTX+FVTX track multiplicity \u22652. Events with smaller multiplicity are thrown out. For events with more than one reconstructed vertex, the vertex with the best reconstruction quality is selected as the primary vertex. For the reconstructed events, we obtain an average z resolution of approximately 180 \u00b5m in 510 GeV p+p collisions.

One uses the like-sign dimuon pairs within events, and the other uses the unlike-sign dimuon pairs in mixed events. To match the yields of the analyzed mixed events to the (same) events, a normalization scale Norm mix , defined in Eq. 2, is applied to the mass distribution of dimuon pairs and muon DCA R distribution in mixed events:",

As shown in Fig. 3, the invariant mass distributions determined by these methods are consistent with each other within statistical uncertainties. The mixed event method is then used to determine the combinatorial background for the final analysis in order to reduce statistical fluctuations. After the combinatorial background subtraction, clear J/\u03c8 peaks are found in both muon arms, as shown in Figs. 3(c) and (d). A mass window cut (2.7 < mass < 3.5 GeV/c 2 ) is applied to the dimuon pair invariant mass distribution to select J/\u03c8 candidates. The signal (combinatorial background subtracted yields) to the combinatorial background ratio in the J/\u03c8 mass window is 18.6 in the 1.2 < y < 2.2 region and 19.9 in the \u22122.2 < y < \u22121.2 region. The full simulation framework, which comprises pythia8 [18]+geant4 [19] +reconstruction, is set up to characterize the DCA R distributions of muons from prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 from B-meson decay. Dead areas in the detector are determined from data on a run-by-run basis and the same vertex and tracking reconstruction algorithms as in data analysis are used. The width of the simulated primary vertex distributions along the x and y axes is 80 \u00b5m as determined from Vernier Scan measurements [20]. The vertex distribution along the z axis used in the simulation has been determined from the real data. To get an accurately reproduced z vertex resolution in simulation, which is dependent on the multiplicity in the event, additional simulated MB events (with z vertex matched to the hard QCD events) are embedded into the prompt J/\u03c8 events, or events with a J/\u03c8 from B-meson decay. To ensure that the accessed kinematic region of the probed parton distribution function (PDF) in the MB events is the same in prompt J/\u03c8 events or in B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 events, the renormalization scale Q 2 renorm defined in pythia, which determines the PDF shape, is kept at the same value between the MB event and the triggered event. To verify that the simulations accurately represent the real data, we have compared the simulated and measured muon DCA R distributions from inclusive J/\u03c8 events. The inclusive J/\u03c8 events in simulation are obtained by combining 90% prompt J/\u03c8 events and 10% J/\u03c8 from B-meson decay. This fraction of B-meson decays to J/\u03c8 is selected based on the average result from global data measured in the same inclusive J/\u03c8 p T region [3][4][5][6][7]. A single Gaussian function is fit to the centroid of the DCA R distributions in data and simulation to derive the resolutions of the prompt component of the DCA R . The momentum dependence of this DCA R resolution extracted from the core region (|DCA R | < 500\u00b5m) is compared between data and simulation. As shown in Fig. 4, good agreement between data and simulation is achieved in both of the measured rapidity regions.",

Figure 5 shows the resulting normalized distribution of DCA R for muons from prompt J/\u03c8 events (blue open circle) and from B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 events (green circle). As explained at the end of Section II, the shape of the muon DCA R distribution in prompt J/\u03c8 events is symmetric, which is consistent with expectations for prompt particle decays. The \u039b b , B \u00b1 , B 0 , B 0 s hadrons have a finite lifetime of 1.4-1.6 ps on average, resulting in a displaced vertex at forward rapidity of approximately 0.8 mm from the primary collision vertex for the J/\u03c8 from B-meson decay. Due to the displacement between the decay vertex and the primary collision vertex, the negative side of the muon DCA R distribution shows a clear deviation from symmetry for B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 events. The respectively symmetric and asymmetric DCA R distributions allow the separation of prompt J/\u03c8 from B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 . Several functions were tested to describe the line shapes of the muon DCA R in both prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 from Bmeson decay in simulations. The final fit functions which will be described below are selected based on the best fits to the simulation spectra with the maximum log-likelihood method and the convolution of the intrinsic DCA R resolution with a function which represents B meson decay kinematics is used. Variations of the fit functions and the simulation setup were then used to account for systematic uncertainties in the fit function. A convolution fit is used to describe the shape of the muon DCA R from prompt J/\u03c8 decay, with the definition shown in Eq. 3.",

MuTr tracks with momentum above 3 GeV/c projected to the fourth station of the FVTX therefore cover a circle with a radius of up to 2 cm for muons, due to the multiple scattering in the absorber. As a result, some  fraction of the MuTr projections will find more than one FVTX track or a single but incorrect FVTX track inside its projected circle, and have a certain probability of selecting an incorrect FVTX match. We refer to these incorrect matches as \"mis-matching background\". To estimate the amount of mis-matching, we attempt to match MuTr tracks from one event to FVTX tracks from a separate event (referred to as swapped events). To be as realistic as possible, the swapped events need to belong to the same z-vertex category, meaning the difference of the z vertex between the swapped event and the true event should be less than 1mm. The selection of 1mm z-vertex difference does not introduce any bias to the DCA R distribution. In addition to this, we also count the mis-matching tracks from swapped events only when the matching track in the swapped event has a better \u03c7 2 than the matching track in the real event, so that we do not overestimate the mismatches in real events. The mis-matching background in the analyzed events is dominated by J/\u03c8 MuTr tracks which do not have a corresponding FVTX track in the real event and accidentally match to a random background track. The fraction of candidate FVTX tracks in swapped events which are found to be wrongly associated with a MuTr track from a good J/\u03c8 dimuon pair, and that pass the quality cuts shown in Table I, is 3% (2%) in the 1.2 < y < 2.2 (\u22122.2 < y < \u22121.2) rapidity region.",

We therefore first fit the unlike-sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum near the J/\u03c8 region including the pythia8-simulated shape of bb and cc components and an unconstrained normalization scale to estimate the contribution. The fit suggests there is a 33% bb fraction in the heavy flavor continuum within the J/\u03c8 mass region. However, we do note there is systematic uncertainty in the pythia8 shape. Because of this uncertainty, for this analysis the fraction of the bb contribution to the heavy flavor yields within the J/\u03c8 mass window is set to be 50%, and varied from 0 to 100% to take into account all possibilities in the systematic uncertainty.",

A fit function is developed to simultaneously extract the prompt J/\u03c8 and B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 yields from the real data DCA R distributions with the maximum log-likelihood method. This fit function comprises five components: 1) muons from prompt J/\u03c8, 2) muons from B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8, 3) combinatorial background determined by mixed events, 4) mismatching between FVTX and MuTr determined by swapped events, and 5) heavy flavor (cc + bb) continuum background. The fit function which is used to determine the shape of muon DCA R distributions from prompt J/\u03c8 (B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8) events is f prompt J/\u03c8 (DCA R ) (f B\u2192J/\u03c8 (DCA R )) as discussed in Section III D. Parameters defined in both Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) are fixed according to the fit to the simulated spectra and the detector resolution smearing is fine-tuned in the data fit. The functions which represent the three background contributions are f combinatorial (DCA R ), f mismatch (DCA R ) and f cc+bb (DCA R ) as discussed in Section III E. Histograms of muon DCA R from different background contributions after normalization are used to represent each component in Eq. (8). Fluctuations of the fit methods, signal and background determinations are studied in the systematic uncertainty evaluations. These functions used to describe the data spectrum, are summarized in Eq.

Normalization and shapes of most of the components are fixed in previous steps. In the final stage of the fit, the fraction of muons from B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 (i.e. F B\u2192J/\u03c8 ), is the main free parameter in the total fit function (defined in Eq. (6)), together with the J/\u03c8 yield and a last tuning of the resolution that is described below. As the DCA R resolution in data can be affected by additional factors which may not be well captured by the simulation (such as event-byevent variations in the vertex resolution, additional smearing from multiple scattering in the nonuniform detector materials, part of the detector randomly dropping out within a run and beam-beam collision geometry fluctuations), an additional free parameter, \u03c3\u2032, is introduced in the convolution fit functions for prompt J/\u03c8 (defined in Eq. 3) and B-meson \u2192 J/\u03c8 (defined in Eq. (4)). It accounts for detector resolution smearing and also captures any uncertainty of the beam spot size. The fit is then performed with the parameter \u03c3 * 1 instead of \u03c3 1 , where \u03c3 * 1 = \u03c3 1 + \u03c3\u2032. The resolution smearing parameter \u03c3\u2032 determined from the fit to the data is within 20 \u00b5m with approximately 20 \u00b5m statistical uncertainty for the 1.2 < |y| < 2.2 region. The size of the smearing is much smaller than the the average x-y beam profile value (around 80 \u00b5m) and the DCA R resolution (around 230 \u00b5m). The value of the resolution smearing \u03c3\u2032 varies from 5 to 70 \u00b5m when different beam profile values in the x-y plane are used in the simulation (from 80 to 180 \u00b5m). Variation of the smearing parameter \u03c3\u2032 will be included in the systematic uncertainty evaluation. Applying the fit procedure to the DCA R distributions, assuming 50% of the heavy flavor continuum contribution comes from bb (see discussions in III E 3), allows the raw fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons from B decays in inclusive J/\u03c8 yields to be extracted. The corresponding raw ratios B \u2192 J/\u03c8 are 7.3% \u00b1 3.7% (stat) for (1.2 < y < 2.2) and 8.1% \u00b1 2.8% (stat) for (-2.2< y <-1.2). The spectra and fit results are shown in Fig. 8.

The energy difference between 500 GeV and 510 GeV is small, so the difference in the B \u2192 J/\u03c8 fraction is negligible. The measured fraction at PHENIX is consistent with the fonll+cem model prediction within uncertainties. The CMS nonprompt and prompt J/\u03c8 cross section measurements at 7 TeV p+p collisions [5] have been compared to the fonll+cem calculations as well. The old cem model underestimated the prompt J/\u03c8 cross section within 1.6 < |y| < 2.4 and J/\u03c8 p T < 5 GeV/c region measured by the CMS experiment in 7 TeV p+p collisions, while the nonprompt J/\u03c8 cross section measured in the same kinematic region and experiment is consistent with the fonll calculations. Calculations with the CEM parameters from [22] give a better agreement between the fonll+cem prediction and the B \u2192 J/\u03c8 fraction measured by CMS [5]. The fonll calculations can reasonably describe the nonprompt J/\u03c8 cross section results at LHCb for p T > 0 [6,7]. The B \u2192 J/\u03c8 fraction F B\u2192J/\u03c8 is also related to the inclusive J/\u03c8 cross section per unit rapidity d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192J/\u03c8) and the bb cross section per unit rapidity d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192bb), F B\u2192J/\u03c8 = 2 \u00d7 d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192bb) \u00d7 Br(B\u2192J/\u03c8 + X) d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192J/\u03c8) ,",

The result is F B\u2192J/\u03c8 = 8.1% \u00b1 2.3% (stat) \u00b1 1.9% (syst). This measurement extends the previously measured F B\u2192J/\u03c8 values at CDF and LHC to lower energy, and is comparable to measurements at higher energies; it is also within 1.0 standard deviation of the fonll+cem calculation which has a nonnegligible dependence on \u221a s, p T and y. The extrapolated d\u03c3/dy(pp\u2192bb) is 3.63 +1.92 \u22121.70 \u00b5b at B hadron mean rapidity, \u00b11.7, in 510 GeV p+p collisions, which is comparable with the fonll calculations in 500 GeV p+p collisions.",

It is also noteworthy that only a factor of two decrease of the b over the c yield is expected going from LHC energies to \u221a s = 510 GeV, as calculated with fonll [27,28]. However, modeling the hadronization of the bound cc at low p T is still a challenge to QCD calculations. The present results provide complementary information to the surprisingly weak evolution of F B\u2192J/\u03c8 in 0.51 \u2264 \u221a s \u2264 13 TeV domain, for central or near central rapidity and low p T production. The analysis procedure developed in this study will be applied to other data sets recorded by PHENIX at different center of mass energies. A similar method can also be applied to the study of B-and D-meson semileptonic decays to muons, which will help to understand the production mechanism of charm and bottom, and provide a complementary measurement to the one presented in this paper.",

The B\u2192J/\u03c8 fraction F B\u2192J/\u03c8 which is defined as N B\u2192J/\u03c8 N prompt J/\u03c8 +N B\u2192J/\u03c8 (N prompt J/\u03c8 is the yield for prompt J/\u03c8, N B\u2192J/\u03c8 is the yield for B\u2192J/\u03c8) can be derived according to Eq. (9).",
