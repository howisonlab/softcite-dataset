The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. Whereas previous searches for neutral scalar or pseudoscalar mediators considered dark matter production in association with a top quark pair only, this analysis also includes production modes with a single top quark. The results are derived from the combination of multiple selection categories that are defined to target either the single top quark or the top quark pair signature. No significant deviations with respect to the standard model predictions are observed. The results are interpreted in the context of a simplified model in which a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator particle couples to a top quark and subsequently decays into dark matter particles. Scalar and pseudoscalar mediator particles with masses below 290 and 300 GeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming a dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV and mediator couplings to fermions and dark matter particles equal to unity.",

While the former results are based on an effective field theory (EFT) approach, the latter ones are interpreted in the context of simplified DM scenarios, where the mediator particle is explicitly modeled in the interaction. These interpretations have so far neglected the contribution from DM production in association with a single top quark (t/t+DM) in which the interaction is mediated by a neutral spin-0 particle, as pointed out in ref. [17]. As in the SM, the single top quark is produced through processes mediated by a virtual t JHEP03(2019)141 channel (figure 1, upper right) or through associated production with a W boson (figure 1, lower left and right) [17]. While the s channel production of a W boson is also possible, this process is found to have a negligible contribution for this search. The neutral DM mediator particle is then produced either by radiation from the top quark or via top quark fusion, as described in ref. [18] for the associated production of DM with a top quark pair.",

This additional production mechanism is predicted by the same interactions described in eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) that also predict tt+DM events. For this reason, in the presented search t/t+DM and tt+DM processes are both considered. Searches for similar final states referred to as \"monotop\", which involve the production of a top quark and DM particles but without additional jets or W bosons, have been conducted by the CDF experiment [19] at the Fermilab Tevatron, by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [20,21] at the CERN LHC at center-of-mass energies of 8 TeV, and at 13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration [22]. The underlying simplified models explored in these results, unlike the one presented in eqs. (1.1) and (1.2), assume either the resonant production of a +2/3 charged and colored spin-0 boson that decays into a right-handed top quark and one DM particle, or a spin-1 mediator with flavor changing neutral current interactions. Considering these models, in addition to the DM particle, only one top quark is assumed to be produced in the final state, unlike the t/t+DM processes considered in this search where the top quark is produced through SM-like diagrams alongside a light quark or a W boson (figure 1).",

The energy of photons is obtained directly from the ECAL measurement and corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is obtained from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The muon track is obtained from the combination of central tracker and muon system information, and its curvature provides an estimate of the momentum. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.",

The physics objects are the jets and the associated p miss T , taken as the negative vector p T sum of those jets. For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from the particles reconstructed with PF (PF candidates) using the infrared-and collinear-safe anti-k T algorithm [26,27] with a distance parameter of 0.4. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the parton's generated momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions [28]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and applied to calibrate the jet momentum. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jets, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale in data and simulation [29]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [29].",

While the detailed background composition depends on the specific channel, the main sources arise from tt+jets, W+jets, and Z+jets production. Simulated events of tt+jets production and single top quark processes are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using powheg v2 and powheg v1 [31][32][33], respectively. For tt+jets processes, the top quark p T distribution is reweighted to reproduce the differential cross section obtained from CMS measurements [34]. Samples of Z+jets, W+jets, and QCD multijet events are generated at leading order (LO) using MadGraph5 amc@nlo [35] with the MLM prescription [36] for matching jets from the matrix element (ME) calculation to the parton shower description. Dedicated electroweak [37][38][39][40][41][42] and QCD (calculated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo) NLO/LO K factors, parametrized as functions of the generated boson p T , are applied to Z+jets and W+jets events. Other SM backgrounds include rare processes, such as tt+W and tt+Z, which are simulated based on the NLO ME calculations implemented in MadGraph5 amc@nlo and the FxFx [43] prescription to merge multileg processes. Diboson processes (WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, ZH) are generated at NLO using either MadGraph5 amc@nlo or powheg v2. All background samples are normalized using the most accurate cross section calculations available, which generally incorporate NLO or next-to-NLO (NNLO) precision.",

Based on the variable definition, in tt(2 ) events the m W T2 distribution has a kinematic end point at the top quark mass, assuming perfect detector response, while this is not the case for signal events where two additional DM particles are present. The calculation of m W T2 requires two b-tagged jets from the decay of the top quarks, where one of these b-tagged jets comes from the same decay chain as the reconstructed lepton. If only one b-tagged jet is identified in the event, each of the first three (or two in three-jet events) leading non-b-tagged jets is considered as the second b-tagged jet in the calculation. The m W T2 is then evaluated for all possible jet-lepton combinations and the minimum m W T2 value is considered to discriminate between signal and background events.

The values for the background multiplicative factors extracted from the fit are on average close to one, with a root-mean-square deviation that ranges from 5% to 21%, depending on the background processes and on the category considered (SL or AH). The post-fit distributions assuming the absence from the DM signal (i.e., the background only fit) are shown in figures 2 and 3 (4 and 5) for the SL and AH CRs (SRs), respectively. No significant excess at high p miss T in the SRs is observed. The SRs, both for the SL and AH channels, are divided into: 1 b-tagged jet and 0 forward jets, 1 b-tagged jet and \u22651 forward jets, and \u22652 b-tagged jets. The plots also contain the pre-fit distributions, represented by the dashed magenta line. The statistical and systematic uncertainties in the prediction are represented by hatched uncertainty bands, while the lower panels show the ratio of data and the post-fit prediction, and the bottom panels show the difference between the observed data events and the post-fit total background, divided by the full statistical and systematic uncertainty.",

The theoretical cross sections for both signal models are obtained at LO. The limits are calculated using a modified frequentist approach with a test statistic based on the profile likelihood in the asymptotic approximation and the CL s criterion [65][66][67].

            "text": "For masses of the mediator particle below 200 GeV for the scalar model and below 300 GeV for the pseudoscalar model, the leading contribution to the sensitivity of the analysis stems from tt+DM. This behavior is mostly driven by the larger cross section for the tt+DM process when compared to the sum of the production processes for t/t+DM. However, the t/t+DM cross section drops less rapidly as a function of mediator particle mass in comparison to the tt+DM mode. Additionally, the p miss T spectrum for a given mediator mass leans towards higher values for the t/t+DM signal model when compared to the tt+DM model. These two features, together with the analysis specifically designed for both DM production modes and the statistical combination of the different SRs, lead up to a factor of two improvement at high mediator masses on the limits when compared to previous results [16]. In particular, the \u22651 forward jet category, which is specifically designed to enhance t/t+DM t channel events, improves the final results up to 14%.  distributions for the CRs of the SL selection.
