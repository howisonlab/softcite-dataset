Experiments presently in preparation will cover the quasi-degeneracy region of the neutrino mass pattern. Probing the so-called inverted hierarchy region requires improved sensitivities and next-generation experiments, based either on large expansions of the present searches or on new ideas. We examine here the potential of a novel technology relying on ZnMoO 4 scintillating bolometers, which can provide an experiment with background close to zero in the ton \u00d7 year exposure scale. The promising performance of a pilot detector is presented, both in terms of energy resolution and background control. A preliminary study of the sensitivities of future experiments shows that the inverted hierarchy region is within the reach of the technique here proposed. A realistic phased approach program towards a next-generation search is presented and briefly discussed.",

            "text": "Neutrinoless double \u03b2 decay (0\u03bd2\u03b2) is a hypothetical rare nuclear transition in which an even-even nucleus changes into an isobar by the simultaneous emission of two electrons and nothing else [1]. The observation of this process would imply the violation of the lepton number conservation and definitely new physics beyond the Standard Model, establishing the Majorana nature of neutrinos. If the transition takes place through the so-called mass mechanism, the decay rate is proportional to the square of the effective Majorana mass m \u03b2\u03b2 , that can be determined or at least constrained within the uncertainties of the nuclear matrix elements. This parameter is related to the absolute neutrino mass scale and depends on the three neutrino masses m 1 , m 2 and m 3 . It is convenient to distinguish three mass patterns: normal hierarchy (NH), where m 1 < m 2 < m 3 , inverted hierarchy (IH), where m 3 < m 1 < m 2 , and quasi-degenerate pattern (QD), where the differences between the masses are small with respect to their absolute values. We ignore Nature's choice about the neutrino mass ordering at the moment, but 0\u03bd2\u03b2 has the potential to provide this essential information [1,2], given the relationship between m \u03b2\u03b2 and the three neutrino masses. In fact, if m \u03b2\u03b2 is measured to be greater than \u2248 50 meV, the QD pattern holds and an allowed range of m min values can be extracted. On the other hand, if m \u03b2\u03b2 lies in the range 20 \u2212 50 meV, the pattern is likely IH. Eventually, if one determined that m \u03b2\u03b2 < 10 meV but non-vanishing (which is unlikely in a foreseeable future), one would conclude that the NH pattern holds. The process 0\u03bd2\u03b2 is important both for the comprehension of fundamental aspects of neutrino physics and for the solution of hot astroparticle and cosmological issues, intimately related to the neutrino mass scale and nature.",

The signal, collected at very low temperatures (typically < 20 mK for large bolometers), consists of a temperature rise of the whole detector determined by a nuclear event. Due to the high energy resolutions and to the wide flexibility in the choice of the detector material, this approach is well tailored to the demands of a sensitive 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiment, based on the so-called source = detector technique [5]. Ultra-pure crystals up to 100 \u2212 1000 g can be grown with interesting materials, containing appealing candidates. The single crystal module can be multiplied in order to achieve total masses of the order of 100 \u2212 1000 kg, necessary to explore the IH region. The CUORE experiment, under commissioning, applies this techonology to the study of the candidate 130 Te in arrays of natural TeO 2 bolometers with \u2248 200 kg isotope mass [6].",

In particular, a massive charged particle can be separated from an electron or \u03b3 due to the different light yield for the same amount of deposited heat, as proposed more than twenty years ago [7]. In the field of double \u03b2 decay, the first experimental proof of this concept was achieved in 1992 with a CaF 2 scintillating bolometer, developed as a pilot device for the search for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 in 48 Ca [8]. Recently, this approach was proposed to study 0\u03bd2\u03b2 of 82 Se (LUCIFER project) with the help of ZnSe crystals [9]. In non-scintillating materials relevant for 0\u03bd2\u03b2, the particle identification can be achieved through the detection of the much weaker Cherenkov light [10,11]. In the current technology, the light is detected by thin dedicated bolometers facing the main one.",

In fact, the energy region extending above 2615 keV is almost free from \u03b3 background due to natural radioactivity, but is dominated by \u03b1 particles, as the experience brought by Cuoricino and CUORE-R&D clearly shows [12]. Hence derives the power and the potential of scintillating bolometers. They offer a reasonable freedom in the choice of the candidate, that can be selected for its high Q-value (such as the here proposed 100 Mo, for which Q=3034.40 (17) keV [13]), with the additional advantage that \u03b1 particles can be recognized and rejected.

The signal time structure was characterized by \u2248 1 ms risetime and \u2248 10 ms decaytime (respectively from 10% to 90% and from 90% to 30% of the signal maximum amplitude). This time behaviour is consistent with the thermal network representing the detector, and corresponds to what commonly observed in dielectric macrobolometers operated in similar conditions. The overall performance of the detector is compatible with the operation of large crystals (of the order of hundreds of grams) in the temperature range 10 \u2212 15 mK, as in the case of TeO 2 bolometers in the CUORE experiment. The amplitude of the signals from the two Ge light detectors was \u2248 1\u22122 \u00b5V for 1 keV deposited energy. The pulses were slightly faster with respect to the heat channel (\u2248 0.9 ms risetime and \u2248 7 ms decaytime). The presence of two light detectors was very useful to identify event classes through triple coincidences (see inset in Figure 2).",

In the Como set-up, where the cryostat is unshielded, a background measurement showed many typical environmental \u03b3 lines ( Figure 2). The intrinsic energy resolution of the heat channel (corresponding to the FWHM baseline fluctuations) is of the order of 800 eV. The energy resolutions on the lines are worse (this is commonly observed in macro-bolometers), but they are always excellent, of the order of 1.3 keV FWHM at the 59 keV 241 Am line and, at higher energies, of 3.8 keV FWHM at the 2615 keV environmental 208 Tl line. This performance shows that ZnMoO 4 is a very promising material for high energy resolution bolometers. The position of the main \u2248 5.5 MeV \u03b1 peak of the 241 Am source on a \u03b3-calibrated energy scale shows that the phonon yield of an \u03b1 particle is larger than that of a \u03b3 or a \u03b2 by a factor \u2248 1.105. A phonon pulse formation model able to explain this result is lacking for the moment. However, this behaviour was observed in ZnSe bolometers as well [19].",

It resulted respectively of 2.08 keV/MeV for \u03b2s, \u03b3s and cosmic muons, and of 0.42 keV/MeV for \u03b1 particles. These values, consistent with previous measurements [20], take into account the light collected by both light detectors (which is the same in both of them for the same event in the ZnMoO 4 crystal within the light detector energy resolution), but do not account for the light collection efficiency. Therefore, they are actually inferior limits. Even considering this, it is clear that ZnMoO 4 is a very poor intrinsic scintillator. However, the light output is largely sufficient to perform efficiently the \u03b1/\u03b2 discrimination. An \u03b1 rejection factor much better than 99.9 % has been determined at the energy of interest for 100 Mo 0\u03bd2\u03b2. The discrimination capability of the detector is appreciable in Figure 3.",

This is the case for our prototype too. The \u03b1 particle signals were faster than \u03b3/\u03b2/muon signals by a few % both in the rise and in the decay times. Once again, we are not able to explain this feature, a model lacking for the phonon pulse formation. However, it can be efficiently used for rejection purposes.

The \u03b1 background spectrum is reported in the inset of Figure 3 and compared with the \u03b1 calibration spectrum. Over an exposure of 25.6 g \u00d7 days, we observed hints for a surface contamination only, probably in 210 Po or 210 Pb, and detectable through a tail below 5.5 MeV. This phenomenon is observed in other bolometric experiments like Cuoricino [23] and EDELWEISS [24]. Since there is no evidence of internal \u03b1 peaks, it is possible to set limits on the contamination of several nuclides belonging to the natural radioactivity chains looking at their first \u03b1 decay. When the expected \u03b1 peak is above 5.5 MeV, we have used both background and calibration spectrum in order to increase the exposure up to 43.1 g \u00d7 days. For the isotopes 232 Th, 228 Th, 227 Ac, 238 U, 234 U, 230 Th, 226 Ra and 212 Bi an upper limit (at 90% c.l.) of respectively 3.3 mBq/kg, 1.1 mBq/kg, 1.1 mBq/kg, 2.7 mBq/kg, 1.1 mBq/kg, 1.7 mBq/kg, 1.1 mBq/kg Figure 3: The ratio of the light-to-heat energy for the same event (using the light detector with better performance) is plotted against the \u03b3-calibrated heat energy. The \u03b1 band (populated by a 241 Am source) is neatly separated from the \u03b2 band (containing also \u03b3s and muons). Lines define 99.9% c.l. regions. Grey points indicate \u03b1 events selected with pulse shape discrimination in the heat channel. In an underground set-up, the \u03b2 band would not be populated above 2615 keV, due to a substantial reduction of the cosmic ray flux. In the inset, \u03b1-calibrated energy spectra containing only \u03b1 events are reported, with -grey lines -and without -black lines -the 241 Am source. and 0.64 mBq/kg can be set. A substantial improvement was observed with respect to a ZnMoO 4 crystal tested in a previous work [20], in particular for the isotope 226 Ra, which exhibited an internal activity -now absent -of 8.1 \u00b1 0.3 mBq/kg. Above 5.5 MeV and therefore out of the region affected by the common contaminants 210 Po and/or 210 Pb, the \u03b1 background spectrum is empty. In particular, the result on 212 Bi (expected peak at 6208 keV) allows to set a limit on the internal activity of its dangerous daughter 208 Tl (see next Section) at 0.23 mBq/kg. This shows that the molybdenum purification method and the whole crystallization procedure are quite promising for a future 0\u03bd2\u03b2 experiment.",

Other possibilities can be considered, like the intermediate case of an octagonal prism. Each ZnMoO 4 crystal will be held by six PTFE blocks similar to those used in the prototype discussed here, with a mass of about 0.5 g each. It will be surrounded by a cylindrical Cu holder with the internal surface covered by a reflective foil. One extremity of the Cu holder will carry a light detector consisting of a Ge disk with 6 cm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness, facing one base of the prism. This is the baseline option, on which the Monte Carlo is based. Another option foresees two identical light detectors at the two extremities, in analogy with the configuration of the prototype here presented. We assume that the single modules are arranged in towers. In order to include the benefits of the array granularity in the Monte Carlo, which enables coincidence cuts, we have designed a test structure with 7 tightly packed towers (in a top view, 6 towers sit at the vertices of a hexagon and the 7 th at its center).

For ZnMoO 4 crystals, contamination by 228 Th and 226 Ra were assumed to be at the level of 0.01 mBq/kg, which is realistic looking at the experience of other bolometric set-ups and considering the promising purification methods established for 100 Mo and here applied to a test bolometer. A comparable level of radio-purity was already reached for ZnWO 4 crystal scintillators [30], produced with the same initial zinc oxide as that used for the synthetization of the ZnMoO 4 crystals. Possible cosmogenically induced activity in ZnMoO 4 was estimated with the COSMO code [31] assuming 3 months of activation on the Earth surface and 1 yr cooling underground. We have found two dangerous nuclides with Q \u03b2 > 3035 keV: 56 Co (Q \u03b2 = 4566 keV, T 1/2 = 77.27 days) and 88 Y (Q \u03b2 = 3623 keV, T 1/2 = 106.65 days). 88 Y can also appear as daughter of cosmogenic 88 Zr (T 1/2 = 83.40 days).",

Given the high energy resolution of the detector and its ability to identify \u03b1s, every time that an \u03b1 count is com-patible with a 212 Bi \u03b1 decay (i.e. contained in a sharp peak at 6207 keV), all the acquired pulses can be discarded for a time gate of \u2248 5 times the half life of 208 Tl, i.e. about 15 minutes. This will reduce the corresponding background by a factor exp(\u221215 \u2022 ln(2)/3.053) \u2248 1/30, with a realistic abatement down to \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 counts/(keV kg y).

This process produces a continuum in the two-electron sum energy spectrum extending from zero up to the Q-value, and peaked roughly at 1/3 of the Q-value itself [1]. Due to the excellent energy resolution of the devices here proposed, the high-energy 2\u03bd2\u03b2 spectrum tail is not harmful. However, the random coincidences of two 2\u03bd2\u03b2 events can produce appreciable background. In a 400 g crystal enriched in 100 Mo at 97%, the total 2\u03bd2\u03b2 rate is 3.15 mBq. Considering the shape of the pile-up spectrum, it is possible to compute the background due to this effect, which scales as the square of the total rate. It is \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u2022[T R /1 ms] counts/(keV kg y), where T R is the pulse-pair resolving time. In bolometers of hundreds of grams, T R would be of the order of tens of milliseconds, since this is the typical heat signal risetime [23]. However, the fast risetime of the light detector here observed would be preserved in large bolometers since the Ge energy absorber would have a mass of only a few grams. This allows to take safely T R of the order of 1 ms, and therefore the 2\u03bd2\u03b2 background contribution around 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 counts/(keV kg y). This level would be 100 times less, and therefore negligible, in a crystal containing natural molybdenum.",

We consider both the use of enriched and natural material, given the reasonably high isotopic abundance of 100 Mo Table 2: Sensitivity (at 90% c.l., Bayesian approach) of experiments based on ZnMoO 4 scintillating bolometers searching for 0\u03bd2\u03b2 of 100 Mo. The assumed background is discussed in the text. The live time is 5 y and the energy window 6 keV, compatible with the performed tests. The enrichment level is 97% (except for the third option, where natural molybdenum is considered) and the efficiency is 90%, compatible with the single module structure. The range in m \u03b2\u03b2 takes into account three different approaches to the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements (QRPA [34,35], ISM [36], IBM-2 [37]).  Table 2). This pilot experiment would have sensitivities comparable to present searches and would constitute the general testbench for scaling up this technology. A further step could exploit existing enriched material, of the order of several kg. This search (option (2) in Table 2) would approach the IH region and could be housed by the former Cuoricino fridge. A major extension is required to substantially cover the IH mass pattern. Molybdenum can be enriched by centrifugation at reasonable prices (of the order of 50 \u2212 100 $/g) and with reasonable throughput. The production of \u2248 350 kg of 100 Mo fits the time and budget scale of a large next-generation 0\u03bd2\u03b2 search. Bolometric masses of the order of 1 ton could be housed, after the completion of the TeO 2 program, by the CUORE dilution refrigerator (under construction) or by the EURECA dilution refrigerator (under design), which could share dark matter and 0\u03bd2\u03b2 searches (options (3) and (4) in Table 2). In addition to the investigation of 100 Mo, a large experiment could detect also the standard two neutrino double electron capture in 64 Zn. This isotope has high isotopic abundance (\u2248 49%). A value of T 1/2 = (1.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 25 y was predicted for this process [38], but it should be noted that other calculations give T 1/2 values one order of magnitude higher. Finally, a detector with a large mass of 100 Mo can perform real-time spectrometry of low-energy neutrinos from different sources (sun, supernovae, etc.) thanks to the low energy threshold (168 keV) and large cross section for inverse \u03b2 decay [39].",

Cosmogenically produced radionuclides inside the ZnMoO 4 crystal scintillators and the Cu details of the set-up. The choice of the first two sources is dictated by the following considerations. Although in the 238 U and 232 Th chains there is no intense \u03b3 line above 2615 keV, there are however two \u03b2 active nuclides -214 Bi and 208 Tl -with Q-values greater than 3 MeV (respectively, 3.270 and 4.999 MeV). Thus, these two isotopes produce \u03b3s and \u03b2s that are energetic enough to give events around 3 MeV on the whole if they are partially absorbed together. A particular dangerous case takes place when the contamination is either in the ZnMoO 4 crystal itself or in the surface of the material facing it; in fact, this allows \u03b2 electrons to deposit efficiently energy in the crystal. External \u03b3s from 208 Tl are dangerous too, because the 2615 keV photon is always in close cascade with others which have enough energy (511 keV, 583 keV and 860 keV) to populate the 3 MeV region when absorbed in coincidence with it. Anticoincidences help in reducing this component. We have to remark also the presence of weak 214 Bi lines (B.R.\u2248 0.15% in the 238 U chain) above 2615 keV.",
