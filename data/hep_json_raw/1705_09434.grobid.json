Although such a result suggests to revisit the current reactor antineutrino spectra modeling, an alternative scenario, which could potentially explain this anomaly, is explored in this letter. Using an appropriate statistical method, a study of the Daya Bay experiment energy scale is performed. While still being in agreement with the \u03b3 calibration data and 12 B measured spectrum, it is shown that a O(1%) deviation of the energy scale reproduces the distortion observed in the Daya Bay spectrum, remaining within the quoted calibration uncertainties. Potential origins of such a deviation, which challenge the energy calibration of these detectors, are finally discussed.",

            "text": "Reactor antineutrino experiments have played a leading role in neutrino physics starting with the discovery of the electron antineutrino in 1956 [1,2], through the first observed oscillation pattern in KamLAND [11], up to recent high precision measurements on the \u03b8 13 mixing angle [3][4][5]. Future projects JUNO [13] and RENO50 [14] even aim at reaching sub-percent accuracy on \u03b8 12 on top of solving the neutrino mass hierarchy puzzle. However, two anomalies in the measured antineutrino spectra are being observed. The first is an overall rate deficit around 6% known as \"The reactor antineutrino anomaly\" [8]. The second one is a shape distortion in the 4-6 MeV region, often quoted as a \"bump\" or \"shoulder\" in the spectra. It should be particularly stressed out that the relation between these two anomalies is not straightforward since shape distortion does not necessarily imply a change in the total rate. This letter focuses on the second anomaly. In Section 2, a quantitative comparison of four reactor antineutrino experiments (Bugey 3 [9], Daya Bay [4], Double Chooz [3] and RENO [5]) is performed to demonstrate their incompatibility, thus questioning nuclear effects as a common origin, as proposed in [10]. The next sections are dedicated to the study of an alternative scenario accounting for the observed distortion. Section 3 reviews the energy scale determination in such reactor antineutrino experiments. Section 4 introduces a combined analysis of the Daya Bay calibration and reactor antineutrino data. Results are presented in section 5 and show that a 1% unaccounted break at 4 MeV in the energy scale can reproduce the observed antineutrino spectrum and still comply with calibration data within uncertainties. Section 6 discusses possible origins of such an energy nonlinearity and especially questions calibration of such detectors.",

The Bugey 3 experiment (B3) [9] has until recently provided the finest reactor antineutrino spectrum. The B3 measurement was in very good agreement with previous predictions [15][16][17]. The comparison is here updated to the most recent predictions [6,7]. As indicated on Figure 1, the net effect is an additional 1%/MeV decrease through the full energy range. This update is still compatible with prediction within the 2% linear spectral uncertainty envelop quoted in [9]. New measurements have been provided by three experiments: Double Chooz (DC) [3], Daya Bay (DB) [4] and RENO (RN) [5]. Their ratios to the state of the art prediction [6,7] are depicted on Figure 1 and exhibit a significant deviation from unity around 5 MeV. At first glance they clearly show a common feature which is described as a bump in the 4 to 6 MeV region. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no quantitative comparison is available in the literature.",

Such an approach offers the advantages of being reactor modeling independent and flexible enough to accurately fit each single data set.

On top of statistical uncertainties, normalization and linear energy scale uncertainties were included in covariance matrices. For DC a 1% in normalization and scale was used, for DB a 2.1% and 1%, for RN a 1.5% and 1% and for B3 a 4% and 1.4% as published by the collaborations [3][4][5]9]. The \u03c7 2 was expanded with a quadratic term penalizing higher local curvatures for smoothness: \u03bb\u00b4f (x) 2 dx. The amplitude of the positive parameter \u03bb controls the regularization strength or equivalently the smoothness of the fitting function. It was automatically determined from data through the generalized cross validation method [21]. This procedure is nearly equivalent to minimizing the model predictive error. The optimization of the global \u03c7 2 was iteratively performed until reaching convergence, each step alternating between the \u03c7 2 function minimization with respect to the w k parameters and the generalized cross validation criterion minimization with respect to \u03bb. The model was fitted to all possible subset of experiments. While our method was able to individually reproduce each spectrum accurately adjusting differently the w k and \u03bb coefficients, it prominently stressed out their inconsistency when combined. A parametric bootstrap procedure was used to estimate the \u03c7 2 min distribution. For each experiment, the combined best fit model (gray curve on Figure 1) was used to draw 10 4 Monte Carlo simulations using their respective covariance matrix. Each of these 10 4 four experiment data set was fitted with the same global framework and the residual sum of squares was computed. Their distribution was found to follow with a good accuracy a Gamma probability density function with a shape parameter of 33 (1 \u00b1 9%) and a scale parameter of 2.8 (1 \u00b1 9%). The associated p-value was estimated using another 10 6 Monte Carlo simulations, because of the uncertainties on the Gamma PDF fitted parameters. The 99 th percentile of the p-value distribution was found below 10 \u22125 while the median was located around 10 \u22128 . As a prominent conclusion, the observed spectra cannot come from a unique distribution with a high statistical significance (more than 4.4 \u03c3 at 99% CL). This result is mostly driven by the mismatch between the DB, RN and B3 spectra since they have by far the highest statistics. Any combination of two of these three experiments is also not consistent. Note that DB and RN chose a different ad hoc normalization. A quick integration of their respective spectra seems to indicate a 2.9% offset in their respective normalization. Our aforementioned procedure outputs respectively a median 3.4 \u03c3 (4 \u03c3) incompatibility with (without) this normalization adjustment. A normalization free fit (increasing normalization uncertainties to infinity in both DB and RN covariance matrices), yields a consistent result with a 3.4 \u03c3 incompatibility (p-value below 7 10 \u22124 ). Except for DC whose tests are compatible with all other experiments within 1.6 \u03c3, the lowest rejection significance between pairs of experiments was found for DB and B3, with a 2.5 \u03c3 significance. A free norm fit still yielded a 2.3 \u03c3 significance rejection of compatibility hypothesis.",

            "text": "On the antineutrino production side, all reactors are similar pressurized water reactors. Seeking for differences among experiments, the core isotopic composition is the main differing component which could play a major role in the antineutrino spectral shape. For a complete fuel burning (a 60-70 GWd/t burnup), the reactor antineutrino rates are known to roughly decrease by \u221210% and the spectra to tilt by approximately \u22124%/MeV between the fresh beginning and the far end of nuclear fuel burning. This effect is reduced by a factor 3 to 4 taking into account reactor operations where fuel assemblies are refreshed by thirds or quarters of the whole core. As indicated in Table 1, the average isotopic compositions over the data taking periods are very close from each other [3][4][5]9]. On the one hand, DB and RN have isotopic compositions which differ upmost by 1.7% (mixture of 6 cores with comparable fuels), but disagree on the distortion amplitude by 60%. On the other hand DC has the most burnt makeup among the four experiments and displays a distortion amplitude comparable to DB, while B3 reactor composition is half-way between DC and DB but does not observe any distortion in the spectrum. There is no simple coherent pattern explaining these variations with isotopic compositions. In a more complex scenario if the antineutrino spectra were extremely sensitive to fission fractions from each reactor, the near/far relative measurement strategy for the \u03b8 13 quest would have failed. With many cores and the disparity of solid angle exposures among each detector, the near/far ratios of DB and alike experiments would also be distorted from one another to a large extent.",

Considering these distortions are proportional to reactor powers [3], a remaining possibility is to investigate at potential detector effects. While not being a definitive argument, it seems more likely to distort an energy scale and produce warped observed spectra to explain DC, DB and RN [3][4][5] than to wipe out a suspected spectral distortion with the exact required compensation from the energy scale to explain the flatness of spectra ratio in B3 [9]. In the next sections unassessed residual nonlinearities in energy scales are studied as a potential scenario to explain not only the difference between experiments but also the mismatches in the data-to-prediction ratios.",

In this process, most of the antineutrino energy is directly conveyed to the positron with nuclear recoil effects totalizing an uppermost 0.1%/MeV correction on positron/antineutrino energy. Antineutrino spectra are therefore well acquired through counting and energy determination of the detected positron. Such positrons deposit their energy in the scintillator, with subsequent light emission through energy transfers between solvent, primary and secondary fluors. The light yield scales nonlinearly with the deposited energy (with a characteristic O(10%) energy distortion below and above 1 MeV [4]). Dedicated and careful laboratory measurements are required for every liquid scintillator to achieve an energy determination accuracy at O(1%) [18,19]. The faint scintillation light is converted using photomultipliers tube (PMTs) to measurable pC charge signals to estimate the energy of the incident particle. Because of the data acquisition systems, digitization process, detection threshold effects, width of time window for charge acquisition, the typical nonlinearity in charge collection amounts to O(10%) [4]. These effects are peculiar to each acquisition system [3,4] and special LED and \u03b3 calibration runs are used to characterize the full electronic acquisition chain.",

The Daya Bay experiment used dedicated \u03b3 calibration sources as well as 12 B \u03b2 spectrum to estimate and constrain the energy scale nonlinearities with an empirical model [4]. This model is a twofold factor, with a first term accounting for scintillation physics, and a second one accounting for electronic nonlinearities. Such an arbitrary function was designed to fit well the available data points, as illustrated on Figures 2 (a) (\u03b3 sources) and (b) ( 12 B \u03b2 spectrum). The \u03b3 data points correspond to the ratios between reconstructed energies and those estimated from the best fitted empirical model [4].

The \u03c7 2 optimization was found to be still slightly sensitive to the number and the position of the knots. To further prevent this, an extra regularization procedure was used to complement the global \u03c7 2 R penalization term. While the bandwidth was kept fixed to the inter-knot distance, the number of knots, K, was chosen with respect to the quality of the standardized fit output residuals. It had to be large enough to correctly model the distortions (more than 10 knots) but small enough to avoid overfitting (less than 30 knots). An optimum of 18 knots was selected, corresponding to a standardized residual distribution the closest to a standard normal distribution among our investigations. Figure 2 presents the output of the global \u03c7 2 function (4) optimization. The RNL best fit appears in orange thick solid line with a shaded orange area indicating the 1 \u03c3 uncertainty. The best fit result gives \u03c7 2 min /ndof = 89.7/86 (p-value of 0.39) with a standardized residual distribution following the standard normal distribution. The fitted distortion correctly reproduces the \u03b3 calibrations, the 12 B constraint and the observed antineutrino spectrum warping. The best fit RNL agrees within 1 \u03c3 with the calibration data points. The 208 Tl and 60 Co around 2.5 MeV as well as the 16 O at 6 MeV are slightly off by less than 2.4 \u03c3 from the best fit. It is worth noting that the obtained RNL is still compatible with the uncertainties originally quoted by the DB collaboration (gray shaded area on Figure 2(a)). Furthermore, the frequently mentioned constraint of the 12 B spectrum is validated, with a fit comparable to the nominal DB one [4]. The ratio of observed to predicted antineutrino spectra is well reproduced with such a fitted RNL. As shown by Figure 2(c), all data points fall within the gray shaded area representing the reactor spectrum prediction uncertainty [6,7] from DB [4]. This study demonstrates that a 1% energy scale distortion could result in a 10%\u03bd e spectrum deformation. This result can be explained by a closer look at the PDF ratio of the\u03bd e reconstructed energies using the best fit RNL and the DB nominal one. To a good accuracy, such a ratio can be computed from a Taylor expansion of Equation (2):",

The red dotted curve on Figure 2(c) shows the small contribution of the third term, \u2212\u03b4(x), to the ratio (9). Although the maximal 1.2% distortion from \u03b4(x) occurs around 4 MeV, the fourth term, \u2212x\u03b4 (x), introduces a 6% positive deviation which is de facto shifted to the 5 MeV region. It dominates by far the PDF ratio as defined by Equation (9) in the shoulder region. It is also worth noting that this term explains as well a large fraction of the deficit in the 2-3 MeV energy region (already corrected from \u03b8 13 effect [4]). The notable feature of this overall RNL is a +1% amplitude kink around 4 MeV. No calibration point constrains the nonlinearity in this region. The nearest one, from 12 C, shows a slight excess around 5 MeV, which is perfectly reproduced by our best fit nonlinearity. As shown by Figure 2(b), the Boron 12 spectrum is mostly unaffected by this additional RNL.",

Our study shows that a small 1% mismatch in energy scale model in a localized energy range around 4 MeV, where no calibration cross-checks are available, can be responsible of the large 10% distortion in the observed to predicted antineutrino spectra. This effect is thus a small one, within calibration uncertainties, which might have been overlooked, and the consequences in reactor spectra prediction are sizable. Bringing definitive statements about absolute reactor spectra measurements requires extremely careful work on energy scale to ensure its robustness.

Under a change/distortion of the histogrammed variable, they behave as a density function. Consequently an extra \"infinitesimal volume conservation factor\" arises with the change of shape of the density function.

It could be of statistical nature, such as a bias coming from an average of nonlinearly biased charges. All the current energy reconstruction strategies in DC, DB, RN use the total charge, received by all PMTs, as a proxy of the true deposited energy. This work hypothesis, while fully legitimate when energy and charge are proportional, starts to break down in scenarii accumulating nonlinearities. Especially, if raw charge nonlinearities are not corrected on each channel (a correction known as \"flat-fielding\" in digital imaging), a complex position/energy nonlinear mapping arises and simple calibration scheme, decoupling energy and position variables, ",

As soon as the raw charge distortion \u03c8(Q) is not a linear mapping, the average of the distorted charges is different from the distorted average charge, whatever the distribution of Q ( \u03c8(Q) = \u03c8( Q ), where . stands for the average over charge distribution). In DC and DB, the electronics nonlinearity correction function is a convex function of the reconstructed charge/energy. Therefore for a given distortion \u03c8, the calibrations are overestimating the true distortions since they use distorted charge averages to estimate this distortion in E scale: \u03c8( Q ) < \u03c8(Q) . The fitted distortion from calibration data is thus overestimating, by construction, the true raw charge distortion. The amount of overestimated distortion depends on the peculiar charge distribution involved in the average estimate, therefore on the energy and position inside the detector. A part of this effect is canceled through the current calibration procedures, especially below 3 MeV and by the fact that in essence reconstructed energies are also to some extent average of charges. However, because of the lack of calibration points around 4 MeV, a residual nonlinearity might still be present as we investigated in this work.",

With the high statistics of the DB experiment it is also possible to build up local antineutrino spectra inside the detectors. If charge reconstructions are biased, the comparison of these local spectra should exhibit enlarged variances, especially in the 4-5 MeV range. The DB and DC fits to the energy resolution already support such a point, with an energy scale systematics evaluated in DB around 1.5% and 1.8% in DC, nearly two times bigger than the quoted precision of the energy scale models. A systematic of such an amplitude is by far sufficient to make observed and predicted antineutrino spectra consistent with each other.",

            "text": "As a conclusion, current observed antineutrino spectra of DC, DB, RN and B3 are not compatible with each other. This study suggests that reactor\u03bd e spectral distortions might have their origin in detector calibration artifacts. Taking into account this systematic effect, reactor spectra predictions become fully compatible with all the observations. Our work is, to our knowledge, the single one able to reconcile current generation of reactor antineutrino experiments with older ones such as Bugey 3, to recover consistency with BILL experiments and their converted \u03b2 spectra. Because an energy scale nonlinearity induces a migration of events across bins, it induces mostly no impact on the reactor rate anomaly. Thus, if this interpretation is correct, the current observed distortions in reactor antineutrino spectra might have no relation with the 6% reactor rate anomaly. Regarding currently observed antineutrino spectra, as opposed to [10], spectra prediction uncertainties would remain unchanged, but observed reactor spectra uncertainties of Double Chooz [3], Daya Bay [4] and RENO [5] should be enlarged. As demonstrated in this article, the 10% spectral distortion around 5 MeV is well within the 1 \u03c3 calibration uncertainty of the energy scale. The uncertainties of Bugey 3 [9] being already consistent with our fit (the slope on spectra ratio might be induced by an energy scale bias within the quoted uncertainties), no extra calibration error is justified for this experiment. Decisive tests have to be planned. Until then a diligent work on studying the energy response of detectors in the 3-5 MeV region is clearly indicated.",
