Only events with one primary vertex are selected to avoid diffractive event contribution. No particle identification is used here [10].  The systematic uncertainty is reduced since the major uncertainty on the production cross-sections, that comes from absolute luminosity measurement, cancels through the ratio. The remaining sources of systematic uncertainty come from kinematic correction of the Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate selection efficiency, the uncertainty in the interaction with material and the diffractive events pollution. Depending on the bins in \u03b7 and p T , they add up to 0.02-0.06 for\u039b/\u039b and 0.02-0.03 for\u039b/K 0 s .

The measurements of V 0 production ratios suggest lower strange baryon suppression and higher baryon number transport than in the Monte Carlo models that have been investigated. The LHCb data are consistent with data from lower energy experiments. Light hadron production ratios ofp/p, K \u2212 /K + , \u03c0 \u2212 /\u03c0 + , (p + p)/(K \u2212 + K + ),(p + p)/(\u03c0 \u2212 + \u03c0 + ) and (K \u2212 + K + )/(\u03c0 \u2212 + \u03c0 + ) have been measured both at \u221a s = 900 GeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV, and compared to some expectation from Monte Carlo models. It suggests that improvements are needed to fully reproduce their behaviour as function of rapidity and transverse momentum.",
