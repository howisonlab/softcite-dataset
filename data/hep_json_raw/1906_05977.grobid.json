The analysis is performed on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.3 fb \u22121 recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is focussed on potential narrow-width resonances with masses above 1.2 TeV, where the decay products of each W or Z boson are expected to be collimated into a single, large-radius jet. The signal is extracted using a three-dimensional maximum likelihood fit of the two jet masses and the dijet invariant mass, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of up to 30% relative to previous search methods. No excess is observed above the estimated standard model background. In a heavy vector triplet model, spin-1 Z and W resonances with masses below 3.5 and 3.8 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level. In a bulk graviton model, upper limits on cross sections are set between 27 and 0.2 fb for resonance masses between 1.2 and 5.2 TeV, respectively. The limits presented in this paper are the best to date in the dijet final state.",

These shortcomings motivate theoretical extensions of the SM that typically introduce new particles, which could be created in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. In this analysis, we test theoretical models that predict new heavy resonances that decay to pairs of vector bosons (W and Z bosons, collectively referred to as V bosons). These models usually aim to clarify open quese-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch tions in the SM such as the large difference between the electroweak and the Planck scales. We consider the bulk scenario of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with warped extra dimensions [1][2][3][4][5], where the spin-2 bulk graviton has an enhanced branching fraction to massive particles, and the heavy vector triplet (HVT) framework [6], which serves as a template that reproduces a large class of explicit models predicting spin-1 resonances.",

            "text": "No significant deviations from the SM background expectation have been observed in previous searches by the CMS Collaboration for such particles in the VV [7][8][9][10][11] and VH [12-17] channels, where H denotes the Higgs boson. Similar results were obtained independently by the ATLAS Collaboration in VV [18][19][20][21]23,25] and VH [22,24,26] resonance searches. In addition, statistical combinations of diboson and leptonic decay channels of the 2016 data set [27,28] have been performed, which extend the exclusion regions of the individual analyses. Lower limits on the masses of these resonances have been set at the TeV scale. The search presented here focusses on resonances with masses above 1.2 TeV, in the decays of which the vector bosons are produced at high Lorentz boost. Because of the large boost of the vector bosons, their decay products are merged into single, large-radius jets, leading to dijet final states. These jets are identified through dedicated jet substructure algorithms. Compared to previous analyses in this final state [7,10,[21][22][23]29], an improved background estimation and signal extraction procedure based on a three-dimensional (3D) maximum likelihood fit is employed, increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. The method can be applied to any search with final states expected to cause resonant behaviour in three observables, whereas previous methods used solely the invariant mass of the final decay products as the search variable. The improved sensitivity and scope has motivated a reanalysis of the pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2016 data taking period, as well as a first analysis of the 2017 data set, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 77.3 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.",

Top quark pair production is modelled at next-to-LO (NLO) with powheg [53], showered with pythia. To calculate systematic uncertainties related to the vector boson tagging efficiency, two additional simulated samples of top quark production at LO are used: one generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo and interfaced with pythia, and the second one generated and showered with pythia. The production of W+jets and Z+jets (V+jets) is simulated at LO with MadGraph5_amc@nlo matched and showered with pythia. The same underlying event tune as for the signal samples is used for those of the background. Two corrections dependent on the transverse momentum ( p T ) [54,55] are applied to the V+jets backgrounds to correct the p T -distribution of the vector bosons computed at LO in QCD to the one predicted at NLO in QCD, and to account for electroweak effects at high p T . The NNPDF 3.1 [56] nextto-NLO (NNLO) PDFs are employed for simulated V+jets events with the 2017 data taking conditions for both the 2016 and 2017 data analyses.",

Jets are reconstructed from these particles, using the anti-k T jet clustering algorithm [59] with a distance parameter of R = 0.8 (AK8 jets) as implemented in the FastJet package [60]. In order to mitigate the effect of pileup, two different algorithms are used: for 2016 data and simulation, charged particles identified as originating from pileup vertices are excluded before jet clustering begins. For 2017, we take advantage of the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) [61] algorithm. This method uses local shape information of charged pileup, event pileup properties, and tracking information in order to rescale the four-momentum of each neutral and charged PF candidate with a weight that describes the likelihood that each particle originates from a pileup interaction. All jets are further required to pass tight jet identification requirements [62]. Jets are corrected for nonlinearities in p T and \u03b7 using jet energy corrections as described in Ref. [63]. Additionally, residual contributions from pileup are corrected using the approach outlined in Ref. [64].",

For some of these triggers additional requirements on the trimmed mass are applied in order to be able to lower the p T and H T thresholds. For example, for 2017 data taking, requiring the trimmed jet mass of the leadingp T jet to be above 30 GeV allows the lowering of the p T threshold Fig. 2 Distribution of the N -subjettiness discriminants (\u03c4 21 and \u03c4 DDT 21 ) for W-jets and quark/gluon jets from QCD multijet events (upper). Distributions in the jet mass of QCD multijet events for four m jj bins in the range 1126-5500 GeV after a cut on \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 DDT 21 corresponding to the same mistag rate of about 2% (lower). For both discriminants, darker colours correspond to higher m jj ranges. The distributions are arbitrarily scaled for better readability. The analysis selections applied to derive these distributions are specified in the plots. For this analysis the working point of \u03c4 DDT 21 \u2264 0.43 is chosen from 500 to 360 GeV while maintaining a similar rate. In the case of the H T -triggers, the threshold can be lowered from 1050 to 750-800 GeV when requiring a trimmed jet mass greater 50 GeV. The H T -triggers utilize a standard jet collection of anti-k T jets with a distance parameter R = 0.4, while the triggers based on the trimmed jet mass operate on AK8 jets. The triggers used for the 2017 data set are conceptually similar to those used in 2016, and correspond to those used in Ref. [29]. The 2017 trigger thresholds were slightly greater than those in 2016 in order to maintain the same trigger rate despite a higher instantaneous luminosity. The trigger efficiency as a function of the dijet invariant mass is measured in an orthogonal single muon data set, shown in Fig. 3, using a combination of all triggers (upper), and as a function of the jet mass for the triggers exploiting the trimmed jet mass (lower). For the trimmed jet mass triggers, the efficiency plateau as a function of the jet mass does not reach 100% for the full 2017 data set (full yellow circles), since these triggers were not used for the first 4.8 fb \u22121 of data recorded. The trigger efficiency excluding this period is shown with open yellow circles. The combination of all trig-gers is > 99% efficient above dijet invariant masses of 990 and 1126 GeV for the full 2016 and 2017 data sets, respectively. For simplicity, the subsequent analysis requires the dijet invariant mass to be above 1126 GeV for both data sets. Given the m jj resolution of about 10%, the lowest resonance mass that is accepted with high efficiency by the analysis is 1.2 TeV.",

The two jets with the highest p T in the event are selected as potential vector boson candidates and are required to have a separation of |\u0394\u03b7| < 1.3 in order to reduce the QCD multijet background. In addition to the requirement that the two jets invariant mass m jj > 1126 GeV, based on the trigger selection discussed above, it is further required that m jj < 5500 GeV. The upper cut on mjj is well above the highest dijet mass event observed in data. To simplify the modelling of the 3D shapes in the m jj -m jet1 -m jet2 space, the two jets are labelled at random so that the mass distributions of the first and second selected jet, m jet1 and m jet2 , have the same shape. Jets originating from the misreconstruction of a high momentum lepton are rejected by requiring an angular separation \u0394R > 0.8 to muons (electrons) with p T greater than 20 (35) GeV and satisfying identification criteria optimized for high-momentum leptons [75,76]. To reduce the QCD multijet background, we require the jet mass to be between 55 and 215 GeV. The selected events are further grouped into two categories according to their likelihood to originate from a boson decay into quarks, as quantified by \u03c4 DDT 21 .

These conditions yield the highest expected signal significance over the whole mass range, while at the same time selecting at least 95% of the signal. The addition of the HPLP category improves the expected cross section upper limit by around 20% at high dijet invariant mass where the background is low. Finally, a loose requirement of \u03c1 = ln(m 2 jet / p 2 T ) < \u22121.8 is applied in order to veto events in which the jet mass is high, but the jet p T is low. In these cases the cone size of \u0394R = 0.8 is too small to contain the full jet, affecting both the jet mass resolution and the \u03c4 DDT 21 tagging efficiency, which is not well modelled in simulation. This selection has a negligible effect on the signal, which typically has jets with masses around the W or Z boson mass and high p T . Figure 4 shows a notable deviation in the shape of the \u03c4 DDT 21 distribution between data and simulation. Such mismodelling introduces a bias in the jet tagging efficiency for the signal, and as a consequence in the measured signal rate. We therefore compute scale factors to correct the signal efficiency accordingly. For the background jets, this mismodelling requires no further correction, because of the data-driven approach adopted in this analysis, where the background shape and normalization are fitted to data with large pre-fit uncertainties as described in the following sections.",

The signal jets, however, mostly have a p T above 600 GeV, and a tagging efficiency around 35%. The signal efficiency for \u03c4 DDT 21 increases with the jet p T , whereas the background efficiency is constant, as shown in Ref. [62]. Two systematic uncertainties in the scale factors are added: one due to differences in MC generation and modelling of the parton shower and one due to NNLO corrections. The former is evaluated by comparing the resulting scale factors when using tt simulation produced with different generators. The latter is evaluated by comparing the extracted efficiencies with and without reweighting according to the top quark p T , where the reweighting is derived from data in order to better describe the observed p T distribution in tt data [77]. The jet mass scale and resolution are estimated in the same fits and also listed in Table 1.

This method permits searches for generic resonances, decaying to two SM or non-SM bosons, anywhere in the jet mass and dijet invariant mass spectra in the future. Additionally, tight jet mass cuts as used in previous diboson resonance searches are no longer needed, as we fit the full jet mass line shape to extract the signal. Since such a cut around the vector boson mass leads to about 20% inefficiency for the W and Z boson signals, including all the events that would fall outside the mass window reduces the statistical uncertainties in the fitting procedure. Furthermore, the background m jj shape is better constrained at high dijet invariant masses than it is in the previous method.",

Because of the low number of events in the HPHP category, the 3D kernel derived in the HPLP category, which has a similar shape, is used to model the HPHP background. This is done by adapting the templates derived in the HPLP category to the HPHP category in the QCD multijet simulation through a fit, and then by using the corresponding post-fit distribution as the nominal template for the HPHP category. The free parameters in the fit are the alternate shapes proportional to m jj , m jet , 1/m jj , and 1/m jet , as listed in Sect. 6. The projections on the three different axes of the final 3D pdf, in bins of m jj or m jet , are shown in Fig. 9, compared to the spectra obtained using bare QCD multijet simulation events.

We define five nuisance parameters that vary the shape, each of the parameters corresponding to an upward and a downward variation of alternative shapes that simultaneously affect all three dimensions. The first nuisance parameter accounts for a variation of the underlying p T spectrum, and the two corresponding mirrored templates are obtained by applying up and down variations of the expected yields to each bin along the two jet masses and m jj by a quantity proportional to m jet and m jj . The second nuisance parameter is a variation of data \u2212 \u03c3 2 fit for each bin to ensure a Gaussian pull-distribution, as defined in Ref. [83] the mass scale, and is taken into account through two mirrored alternative shapes obtained by applying up and down variations of each bin content along the two jet masses and m jj by a quantity proportional to 1/m jet and 1/m jj . Two additional alternative shapes that simultaneously affect resonance mass and jet groomed mass are also added in order to take into account differences in MC generation and modelling of the parton shower. These alternative templates are derived using the herwig++ and MadGraph+pythia8 QCD multijet simulation. This allows us to include all known background variations into the fit. For events with a large m jet (> 175 GeV) and low m jj (< 1200 GeV), there is an expected turn-on due to the trigger thresholds. Therefore, an additional shape uncertainty parameterizing any discrepancy between the 3D template and the QCD multijet simulation is added to the fit. Note that this shape uncertainty only affects this par-ticular region, which is far from where a diboson signal, as relevant for this analysis, is expected. The nuisance parameters associated with these alternative shapes are constrained using Gaussian pdfs in the fit, with the pre-fit values chosen in order to cover any differences between data and simulation observed in the control regions. The alternative shapes described above are shown in Fig. 9.",

The p Tdependence uncertainty in the scale factor arises from the extrapolation to higher p T 's of the W boson tagging efficiency scale factors, which are measured in tt events where the jet has a p T around 200 GeV. This uncertainty is estimated in signal simulation, and is based on the difference in tagging efficiency between the samples matched and showered either with pythia or with herwig++, as a function of p T , relative to the difference at 200 GeV.

Each of the two bosons decays into one large-radius jet, yielding dijet final states. The search is conducted using a novel approach based on a three-dimensional maximum likelihood fit in the dijet invariant mass as well as the two jet masses, thus taking advantage of the fact that the expected signal is resonant in all three mass dimensions. This method yields an improvement in sensitivity of up to 30% relative to previous search methods. The new method places additional constraints on systematic uncertainties affecting the signal by measuring Fig. 13 Expected 95% CL upper limits on the product of the production cross section (\u03c3 ) and the branching fraction for a G bulk \u2192 WW signal using 35.9 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2016 obtained using the multidimensional fit method presented here (red solid line), compared to the result obtained with previous methods (black dash-dotted line) [29]. The final limit obtained when combining data collected in 2016 and 2017 is also shown (blue dashed line) the standard model background from W or Z production with associated jets, accounting for 5% of the overall improvement in sensitivity. Decays of W and Z bosons are identified using jet substructure observables that reduce the background from quantum chromodynamics multijet production. No evidence is found for a signal, and upper limits on the resonance production cross section are set as a function of the resonance mass. The limits presented in this paper are the best to date in the dijet final state, and have a similar sensitivity as the combinations of diboson and leptonic decay channels using the 2016 data set. The results are interpreted within bulk graviton models, and as limits on the production of the W and Z bosons within the heavy vector triplet framework. For the heavy vector triplet model B, we exclude at 95% confidence level W and Z spin-1 resonances with masses below 3.8 and 3.5 TeV, respectively. In the narrow-width bulk graviton model, upper limits on the production cross sections for G bulk \u2192 WW (ZZ) are set in the range of 20 (27) fb to 0.2 fb for resonance masses between 1.2 and 5.2 TeV. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
