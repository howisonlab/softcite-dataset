A precision measurement of the helicity-suppressed ratio R K of the K \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd and K \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u03bd decay rates has been performed using the full data set collected by the NA62 experiment in 2007-2008. The result is R K = (2.488 \u00b1 0.010) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. An improved upper limit on the rate of the lepton number violating K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2213 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 decay from the NA48/2 experiment (2003)(2004) data set) is presented. Finally, the NA62 project aiming at a measurement of the branching ratio of the ultra-rare decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd at 10% precision is discussed.",

Specific ratios of leptonic decay rates can be computed very precisely: in particular, the SM prediction for the ratio R K = \u0393(K e2 )/\u0393(K \u00b52 ) is [ where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values, and |\u2206 31 R | is the mixing parameter between the superpartners of the right-handed leptons, which can reach \u223c 10 \u22123 . This can enhance R K by O(1%) without contradicting any known experimental constraints. A precise R K measurement based on the full data sample collected during the R K phase of the CERN NA62 experiment in 2007-2008 (\u223c 10 times the world K e2 sample) is presented, superseding an earlier result [3] based on a partial data set.",

These decays are strongly suppressed in the SM (highest CKM suppression), and are dominated by top-quark loop con-tributions. The SM branching ratios have been computed to an exceptionally high precision with respect to other loop-induced meson decays: BR(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) = 8.22(75) \u00d7 10 \u221211 and BR(K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) = 2.57(37) \u00d7 10 \u221211 ; the uncertainties are dominated by parametric ones, and the irreducible theoretical uncertainties are at a \u223c 1% level [7]. The extreme theoretical cleanness of these decays remains also in new physics scenarios like Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) or non-MFV models, and even modest deviations of BRs from their SM values can be considered signals of new physics.",

Assuming a 10% signal acceptance and the SM decay rate, the kaon flux should correspond to at least 10 13 K + decays in the fiducial volume. In order to achieve a small systematic uncertainty, a rejection factor for generic kaon decays of the order of 10 12 is required, and the background suppression factors need to be measured directly from the data. In order to achieve the required kaon intensity, signal acceptance and background suppression, most of the existing NA48/NA62 apparatus will be replaced with new detectors.",

This result is consistent with the SM expectation, and constrains multi-Higgs and fourth generation new physics scenarios. NA48/2 has improved the upper limit on the branching ratio of the lepton number violating decay K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2213 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u00b1 , which is now 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22129 at 90% CL. The ultra-rare K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd decay represents a unique environment to search for new physics.
