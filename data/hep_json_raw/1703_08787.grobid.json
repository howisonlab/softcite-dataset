A fit to the cross section shows contributions from two structures: the first has M = 4209.5 \u00b1 7.4 \u00b1 1.4 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 80.1 \u00b1 24.6 \u00b1 2.9 MeV, and the second has M = 4383.8\u00b14.2\u00b10.8 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 84.2\u00b112.5\u00b12.1 MeV, where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. The lower-mass resonance is observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) for the first time with a statistical significance of 5.8\u03c3. A charged charmonium-like structure is observed in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686) invariant mass spectrum for data at \u221a s = 4.416 GeV. A fit with an Swave Breit-Wigner function yields a mass M = 4032.1 \u00b1 2.4 MeV/c 2 , where the errors are statistical only. However, there are still unresolved discrepancies between the fit model and data. The width of the intermediate state varies in a wide range for different kinematic regions within the data set. Therefore no simple interpretation of the data has been found, and a future data sample with larger statistics and more theoretical input will be required to better understand this issue. ",

            "text": "In the past decade, a series of new vector (J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 ) charmoniumlike states, e.g., the Y (4260), Y (4360), and Y (4660), have been observed in e + e \u2212 annihilation through dipion hadronic transitions to low mass charmonium states [1][2][3][4][5]. Many theoretical interpretations have been proposed to understand the underlying structure of the Y family of states, such as hybrid charmonium [6], tetraquark [7], or hadronic molecule [8] etc. The Y (4360) was first observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR Y (4360) \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) by BaBar [4] and subsequently confirmed by Belle [5]. Recently, two resonant structures were observed in the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 at BESIII [9], indicating the Y (4260) resonance reported by previous experiments [1][2][3] actually consists of two structures. There are two resonances observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [10] in the mass region between 4.2 and 4.4 GeV/c 2 . The lower mass state, Y (4220), has a mass consistent with the lower mass state observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [9], but has a somewhat larger width. The higher mass state, Y (4390), does not match any known vector charmonium or charmoniumlike states. Therefore, a more precise measurement of the cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) at BESIII will help to clarify the spectrum of vector particles.",

            "text": "In recent years, another mysterious and interesting new pattern of charmoniumlike states, the Z \u00b1 c 's, have been observed both in final states containing a charged pion and a low mass charmonium state [3,[11][12][13], and in pairs of charmed mesons (D ( * )D * ) \u00b1 [14][15][16]. A similar pattern of states is also observed in the bottomonium system [17]. All of these states contain a minimum of four quarks as they are electrically charged and their constituents include a cc pair. They are good candidates for mesonmeson molecules or tightly bound tetraquark states. To clarify their true nature, it is essential to search for this kind of exotic state in other final states. Belle's recently updated result of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686), using their full data samples, shows evidence for a new Z \u00b1 c state in the mass spectrum of \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686) with a mass around 4.05 GeV/c 2 and a statistical significance of 3.5\u03c3 [5]. It is important to confirm the existence of this new Z \u00b1 c candidate in other experiments.",

The cylindrical BESIII detector has an effective geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 and is divided into a barrel section and two endcaps. It contains a small cell, helium-based (60% He, 40% C 3 H 8 ) main drift chamber (MDC) which provides a momentum measurement of charged particles with a resolution of 0.5% at a momentum of 1 GeV/c in a magnetic field of 1 Tesla. The energy loss measurement (dE/dx) provided by the MDC has a resolution better than 6%. A time-of-flight system (TOF) consisting of 5-cm-thick plastic scintillators can measure the flight time of charged particles with a time resolution of 80 ps in the barrel and 110 ps in the endcaps. An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consisting of 6240 CsI (Tl) in a cylindrical structure and two endcaps is used to measure the energies of photons and electrons. The energy resolution of the EMC is 2.5% in the barrel and 5.0% in the endcaps for photon/electrons with an energy of 1 GeV. The position resolution of the EMC is 6 mm in the barrel and 9 mm in the endcaps.

The \u03c8(3686) signal is reconstructed with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 system (four combinations per event) whose invariant mass M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8), calculated with the corrected momentum after the 5C or 2C fit, is closest to the nominal \u03c8(3686) mass (M (\u03c8(3686))) [27].",

Potential backgrounds without a J/\u03c8 in the final state are explored with events within the J/\u03c8 sideband regions. Backgrounds including a J/\u03c8 in the final state are studied with both inclusive and exclusive MC samples. From these studies, no peaking background is expected in the range of interest in the two \u03c8(3686) decay modes.

            "text": "Several sources of systematic uncertainty are considered in the measurement of the Born cross section. The uncertainty in the tracking efficiency for leptons and pions are 1.0% per track [30]. The uncertainty in the photon efficiency is 1.0% per photon [31]. The uncertainty related to the requirement on the number of hits in the muon counter is 4.2%, determined by studying a control sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. The uncertainty associated with the kinematic fit is estimated with the same technique as in Ref. [32]. The uncertainty associated with the J/\u03c8 mass requirement is estimated by smearing the M (\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) distribution of MC samples according to the resolution of M (\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) in data, and the difference in MC efficiencies is taken as the uncertainty. In mode II, the uncertainties associated with the requirements on M corr \u03c8(3686) , M (\u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and cos \u03b8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are evaluated by changing the requirements. The uncertainty associated with the fit procedure is investigated by varying the fit range, replacing the linear function by a second-order polynomial function for the background, and varying the width of the Gaussian function for signal. For data sets with large luminosity, the detection efficiency is estimated with a MC sample weighted according to the observed Dalitz plot M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c8(3686)) versus M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). The corresponding uncertainty is estimated by varying the weight factors according to the statistical uncertainty of data in each bin TABLE I. Summary of the measurement of the Born cross section \u03c3 B at individual c. m. energies. The subscript 1 or 2 denotes mode I or II, respectively. The first uncertainties are statistical, and the second systematic. An upper limit at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) is determined by a profile likelihood method [29] for data samples with low signal significance. on the Dalitz plane. For data sets with low luminosity, the detection efficiency is estimated using MC samples with the Jpipi model; the corresponding uncertainty is evaluated with large luminosity data sets, by taking the largest difference of efficiencies between the Jpipi model MC sample and their nominal values with weighted MC. The uncertainty related with the ISR correction factor is studied by replacing the input cross section line shape with the latest results from BaBar [4] in KKMC, and the change on (1 + \u03b4 v ) \u01eb is taken as an uncertainty. The uncertainty in the vacuum polarization factor is 0.5% taken from a QED calculation [33]. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is 1%, determined with large angle Bhabha events [19]. The uncertainties in the decay branching fractions of intermediate states are quoted from the PDG [27]. The uncertainty from others sources, such as lepton separation, trigger efficiency, and FSR are negligible, and are conservatively taken to be 1.0%. Assuming all sources of systematic are independent, the total uncertainties are obtained by adding the individual values in quadrature, and are in a range between 7.7% to 14.1% and 7.4% to 20.1%, depending on c.m. energy, for mode I and II, respectively.",

The PDF of the direct process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) is taken from a MC-simulated shape using the Jpipi model, and that of the non-\u03c8(3686) background is described with the distribution of events in the \u03c8(3686) sideband region.

For data at \u221a s = 4.358 GeV, as shown in the Dalitz plot, a cluster of events appears in the M 2 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686)) spectrum at low M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), which also shows a hint of an intermediate structure. As mentioned previously, for data at \u221a s = 4.258 GeV, the structures with masses of 3900 and 4030 MeV/c 2 on the M (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686)) spectrum are kinematic reflections of each other, so the fit results are strongly dependent on whether the Z c (3900) \u00b1 is included in the fit or not. For data at \u221a s = 4.226 GeV,",

Dalitz plots of M 2 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686)) versus M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), distributions of M 2 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686)) (two entries per event), and M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) for data at \u221a s = 4.38 and 4.600 GeV, Dots with errors are data, the dashed (pink) and dash-dotted (blue) curves show the shapes from intermediate state and direct process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) (with arbitrary scale). tions of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) are measured. The measured cross sections are in good agreement with those from Babar and Belle [4, 5], but with significantly improved precision. The cross section is fit with three coherent Breit-Wigner functions. The parameters of two resonances, the Y (4220) and Y (4390), are determined from the fit to be M = 4209.5 \u00b1 7.4 \u00b1 1.4 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 80.1 \u00b1 24.6 \u00b1 2.9 MeV for the Y (4220), and M = 4383.8 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b1 0.8 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 84.2 \u00b1 12.5 \u00b1 2.1 MeV for the Y (4390), where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. The resonance Y (4220) is observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) for the first time with a significance of 5.8\u03c3. Both of the resonances Y (4220) and Y (4390) are consistent with the vector resonances observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c[10]. The Y (4220) state is possibly the same state as observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8[9] and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0[37], and an attempt was made with a combined fit to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c , and \u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 + c.c cross sections measured by BESIII to determine the resonant parameters of the Y (4220)[40]. Peaking at a similar mass was also observed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8[41] at BESIII. A charged charmonium-like structure is observed in the M (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8(3686)) spectrum for data at \u221a s = 4.416 GeV. A fit to the structure, assuming the existence of a spinparity 1 + charmonium-like state, yields a mass M = 4032.1\u00b12.4 MeV/c 2 , where the errors are statistical only. However, the fit cannot describe data well. The width of the intermediate state varies over a wide range for different kinematic regions of data at \u221a s = 4.416 GeV. Similar fits are carried out to data at \u221a s = 4.258 and",
