This measurement is based on 567 pb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilation data produced at \u221a s = 4.599 GeV, which is just above the \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c threshold. The data were collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage rings. The branching fraction is determined to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bde) =",

As the branching fraction for \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bde is the benchmark for those of other \u039b + c semileptonic channels, our result provides a unique test of different theoretical models, which is the most stringent to date. c , provide a stringent test for non-perturbative aspects of the theory of strong interaction. In particular, the decay rate of the most copious SL decay mode, \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e , serves as a normalization mode for all other \u039b + c SL decay rates. The \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e decay is dominated by the Cabibbo-favored transition c \u2192 sl + \u03bd l , which occurs, to a good approximation, independently of the spin-zero spectator ud diquark. This leads to a simpler theoretical description and greater predictive power in modeling the SL decays of the charmed baryons than the case for mesons [1]. However, model development for semileptonic decays of charmed mesons is much more advanced because of the availability of experimental data with precision better than 5% [2]. An experimental study of \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e is therefore desirable in order to test different models in the charm baryon sector [3].",

However, predictions of the branching fraction (BF) B(\u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e ) in different theoretical models vary in a wide range from 1.4% to 9.2% [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15], depending on the choice of various \u039b + c wave function models and the nature of decay dynamics. In addition, theoretical calculations prove to be quite challenging for lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) due to the complexity of form factors, which describes the hadronic part of the decay dynamics in \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd e [16].",

We obtain the number of events of the first type of backgrounds to be 1.4 \u00b1 0.8, after scaling to the \u039b signal region. The second peaking background arises from \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and some hadronic decays, such as \u039b + c \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , \u039b\u03c0 + and \u03a3 0 \u03c0 + .
