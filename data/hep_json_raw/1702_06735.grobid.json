This involves minimizing the differences between a model and data, which is mostly done by performing a minimization of a cost function, for example the likelihood function. However, problems arise because the computations become very expensive as the complexity of the models and number of events increases. The GooFit [1][2][3] framework has been designed to address this issue by allowing such computations to be performed in parallel. It is built upon the Thrust library [4] to be able to run on different parallel architectures, while maintaining a control flow similar to the RooFit package [5], which is commonly used in high energy physics to fit theoretical models to data, and which only runs on CPUs. While GooFit has been successfully employed in several analyses, even for complex models such as time-dependent mixing in threebody decays, it did not allow for performing a time-dependent amplitude analyses of four-body decays. This functionality was recently added and will be described in this paper.",

Structure and implementation of four-body amplitudes While equation 1is completely general, the amplitudes that encode the properties of the decay are functions of the position in phase space occupied of the final state of the decay. The amplitude structure of a four-body decay is significantly more complicated than that of threebody decays because their phase space is five dimensional while three-body decays merely occupy a two-dimensional phase space. Similar to other amplitude models, the implemented functionality assumes that multibody decays mostly proceed via quasi two-body processes, which include two-body resonances. This leads to two possible decay chain topologies depicted in figure 2, where R 1 and R 2 are intermediate resonances and a, b, c and d are the four final decay products, in various configurations. Here, R 1 and R 2 can take the form of multiple kinematically allowed resonance states, resulting in many possible decay chains. A complete amplitude will therefore be modelled Figure 2. Possible quasi two-body decay topologies of a four-body decay. Left, a D 0 meson decays into two resonances R 1 and R 2 , which decay into two particles each. Right, a D 0 meson decays into a particle a and a resonance R 1 , which proceeds to decay into a resonance R 2 and a final state particle.

The model creation is finalized by creating an instance of the time-dependent amplitude model class and passing the two amplitudes just created by the user. Upon creation the time-dependent model class automatically checks for recurring form factors, spin factors, and lineshapes in all decay chains. In case of multiple occurrences, these instances are substituted by a link to a single instance, thus removing redundant calculations.

The first one targets the generation speed of pseudo-events according to a time-dependent amplitudemodel. This generation is repeated for three different sample sizes to study the scaling behavior. Secondly, the performance of the fitting procedure is studied, where the scaling behavior is studied by increasing the number of used events in the normalization while leaving the sample size one fits to constant. These tests are repeated on three different platforms: a server with two Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 CPUs, each with 12 physical cores that can run two concurrent threads, a NVIDIA K40 GPU and a mid-range mobile gaming GPU NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M. The results are obtained by an average over 5 runs, and listed in tables 2 and 3. They show a significant speedup when utilizing the K40 and even the outdated mid-range mobile graphics card was able to perform surprisingly well compared to the other two platforms, but due to insufficient memory it was not able to complete all tests. While the non-linear scaling from 24 to 48 cores was expected as one only increases the logical number of cores by running two threads per core, the expected performance gain from the K40 compared to the GT 525M was less than a priori expected. Using the available NVIDIA profiler, we are able to determine that the source of the throttled performance on the K40 is due to memory latency. We hope to reduce this in the future by reducing the used memory as well adapting the current memory layout to make memory transfers more efficient.",
