            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] is an attractive extension of the standard model (SM) of particle physics. It potentially provides solutions to some of the shortcomings affecting the SM, such as the need for fine tuning [9][10][11][12][13][14] to explain the observed value of the Higgs boson mass [15][16][17][18][19][20], and the absence of a dark matter (DM) candidate. Supersymmetric models are characterized by the presence of a superpartner for every SM particle with the same quantum numbers except that its spin differs from that of its SM counterpart by half a unit. The cancellation of quadratic divergences in quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass from SM particles and their superpartners could resolve the fine-tuning problem. In SUSY models with R-parity conservation [21], the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable [22,23] and could be a DM candidate [24]. The superpartners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, namely the bino, winos, and Higgsinos, mix to",

In this paper we assume \u03c7 0 1 , the lightest neutralino, to be the LSP. The analysis reported in this paper investigates the production of the hypothetical \u03c4 slepton ( \u03c4 ), the superpartner of the \u03c4 lepton. Supersymmetric scenarios in which the \u03c4 is light lead to the possibility of \u03c4 lepton rich final states [25,26]. Coannihilation scenarios involving a light \u03c4 that has a small mass splitting with an LSP that is almost purely bino lead to a DM relic density consistent with cosmological observations [27][28][29][30][31][32], making the search for new physics in these final states particularly interesting. In this analysis, we examine simplified SUSY models [33][34][35][36] in which the \u03c4 can be produced either directly, through pair production, or indirectly, in the decay chains of charginos and neutralinos. In all cases, we assume that the \u03c4 decays to a \u03c4 lepton and \u03c7 0",

            "text": "The cross section for direct \u03c4 pair production depends strongly on the chirality of the SM partner [47], while the experimental acceptance also changes considerably due to differences in the polarization of the \u03c4 leptons. We use the terms left-or right-handed \u03c4 to refer to a \u03c4 that is the superpartner of a left-or right-handed chiral state, respectively. In the case of a purely right-handed \u03c4 , the decay products of hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons originating from \u03c4 decays have larger visible transverse momentum (p T ) than in the purely left-handed scenario, while the reverse is true for leptonically decaying \u03c4 leptons. Three different scenarios of direct \u03c4 pair production are considered in this paper: (i) a purely left-handed \u03c4 ( \u03c4 L ), (ii) a purely right-handed \u03c4 ( \u03c4 R ), and (iii) maximal mixing between the right-and left-handed eigenstates. We also consider simplified models of mass-degenerate chargino-neutralino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 ) and chargino pair ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 \u2213 1 ) production. We assume that \u03c7 0 2 (the second-lightest neutralino mass eigenstate) decays through the chain \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c7 0 1 , and that \u03c7 \u00b1 1 (the lightest chargino) decays as \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 / \u03bd \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 \u03c7 0 1 , with equal branching fractions assumed for each of the two possible \u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay chains. For these indirect \u03c4 production mechanisms, we assume the \u03c4 to be in the maximally mixed state, and the degenerate \u03c4 and \u03bd \u03c4 masses to be halfway between the mass of the produced particles ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 / \u03c7 0 2 ) and the \u03c7 0 1 mass. Diagrams illustrating these simplified models of direct and indirect \u03c4 production are shown in figure 1. The results reported in this paper are based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016 in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . We study events with two \u03c4 leptons in the final state, taking into account both hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the \u03c4 lepton. The following reconstructed visible final states are considered: e\u00b5, e\u03c4 h , \u00b5\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , where \u03c4 h denotes a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton. For the purposes of this paper, we will occasionally refer to the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state as the all-hadronic final state, and the e\u00b5, e\u03c4 h , and \u00b5\u03c4 h final states collectively as the leptonic final states. In most cases, we -2 -  Figure 1.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [48]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [49].",

Events selected for the search are required to pass filters [51] designed to remove detectorand beam-related noise and must have at least one reconstructed vertex. Usually more than one such vertex is reconstructed, due to pileup, i.e., multiple pp collisions within the same or neighboring bunch crossings. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is selected to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the jets, clustered using a jet finding algorithm [52,53] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated p miss T . Charged particles that originate from the primary vertex, photons, and neutral hadrons are clustered into jets using the anti-k T algorithm [52] with a distance parameter of 0.4, as implemented in the FastJet package [53]. The jet energy is corrected to account for the contribution of additional pileup interactions in an event and to compensate for variations in detector response [53,54]. Jets considered in the searches are required to have their axes within the tracker volume, within the range |\u03b7| < 2.4. We also require them to have p T > 20 GeV.

Electron and muon candidates are required to be consistent with originating from the primary vertex by imposing restrictions on the magnitude of the impact parameters of their tracks with respect to the primary vertex in the transverse plane (d xy ), and on the longitudinal displacement (d z ) of those impact points. To ensure that the electron or muon candidate is isolated from any jet activity, the relative isolation quantity (I rel ), defined as the ratio of the scalar p T sum of the particles in an \u03b7-\u03c6 cone around the candidate to the candidate p T , is required to be below a threshold appropriate for the selection under consideration.

One of these discriminating variables is the \"stransverse mass\" m T2 [74,75]. This kinematic mass variable is a generalization of the variable m T for situations with multiple invisible particles. It serves as an estimator of the mass of pair-produced particles in situations in which both particles decay to a final state containing the same invisible particle. For direct \u03c4 pair production, with both \u03c4 decaying to a \u03c4 lepton and a \u03c7 0 1 , m T2 should be correlated with the \u03c4 mass.

To take this correctly into account, we define three categories for events that have at least two loosely isolated \u03c4 h candidates: events with both \u03c4 h candidates passing the very tight isolation requirement, events with one passing and one failing the very tight isolation requirement, and finally events with both \u03c4 h candidates failing the very tight isolation requirement.

The results are interpreted as limits on the cross section for the production of \u03c4 pairs in the context of simplified models. The produced \u03c4 is assumed to always decay to a \u03c4 lepton and a \u03c7 0 1 . The 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on SUSY production cross sections are calculated using a modified frequentist approach with the CL s criterion [83,84] and asymptotic approximation for the test statistic [82,85]. Since the cross section of direct \u03c4 pair production and the \u03c4 lepton decay are strongly dependent on chirality, the results are shown for three different scenarios. Figures 11-13 show the cross section upper limits obtained for \u03c4 \u03c4 production for the left-handed, maximally mixed, and right-handed scenarios as a function of the \u03c4 mass for different \u03c7 0 1 mass hypotheses, namely 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 GeV. It can be seen that the constraints are reduced for higher \u03c7 0 1 masses due to the smaller experimental acceptance. The stronger than expected limits observed at low \u03c4 mass values for a \u03c7 0 1 mass of 50 GeV in the purely left-and right-handed scenarios are driven by a deficit in the \u00b5\u03c4 h final state in the 0-jet category, leading to strong constraints on the -22 -",

Upper limits on the cross section of direct \u03c4 pair production are derived for simplified models in which each \u03c4 decays to a \u03c4 lepton and the lightest neutralino, with the latter being assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The analysis is most sensitive to a \u03c4 that is purely left-handed. For a left-handed \u03c4 of 90 GeV decaying to a nearly massless LSP, the observed limit is 1.26 times the expected production cross section in the simplified model. The limits obtained for direct \u03c4 pair production represent a considerable improvement in sensitivity for this production mechanism with respect to previous ATLAS and CMS measurements. Exclusion limits are also derived for simplified models of charginoneutralino and chargino pair production with decays to \u03c4 leptons that involve indirect \u03c4 production via the chargino and neutralino decay chains. In the chargino-neutralino production model, in which the parent chargino and second-lightest neutralino are assumed to have the same mass, we exclude chargino masses up to 710 GeV under the hypothesis of a nearly massless LSP. In the chargino pair production model, we exclude chargino - masses up to 630 GeV under the same hypothesis. In both cases, we significantly extend the exclusion limits with respect to previous CMS measurements.",
