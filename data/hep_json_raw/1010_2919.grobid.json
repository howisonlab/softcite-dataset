However these measurements are intrinsically biased towards the jet fragments that interacted least in the medium. A more sensitive measurement of jet quenching can be performed with full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions. In this article, the preliminary jet results in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV are discussed with jet reconstruction prospects in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC utilizing the CMS experiment. The first of the following sections discusses the jet reconstruction methods in CMS. This section is followed by the techniques used to calibrate the jet energy scale and a brief discussion of jet triggering capabilities. Finally the results in p+p and the prospects in heavy ion collisions are reviewed.",

The CMS experiment at the LHC is a multi-purpose detector designed to explore the physics at the TeV energy scale. With high quality electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters covering a wide range in pseudorapidity for the full azimuthal angle, by design CMS is very well suited to measure hard scattering processes. Subdetectors such as the high precision silicon tracker with a very good momentum resolution are complimentary to the calorimeters for jet studies. For example the silicon tracker can be used to correct the jet energy for distortions due to the large magnetic field affecting the energy resolution of the low E T jets. All sub-systems are built with high resolution detectors to cope with the high luminosity p+p collisions. Also by design CMS detectors are well suited to study events with large multiplicites resulting from heavy ion collisions.",

The first one of these methods is the calorimeter jets which are reconstructed using the calorimeter towers that are combined from energy deposits in hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeter cells. The second method is called jet plus tracks (JPT) and has been developed to correct the calorimeter jets energy and the direction by utilizing the silicon tracker. The JPT method improves the p T response and resolution especially in the low p T region where the calorimetric response is poor. The particle flow jets (PFJ) reconstruct jets starting from all stable particles in the event, i.e., electrons, muons, photons and charged and neutral hadrons by combining information from all sub-detectors 4 . The last method reconstructs track jets from only tracks of charged particles measured in the high precision silicon tracker. Since it is completely independent from the calorimetric measurements, it is used as a cross-check method for the jet results 5 .",

The relative (\u03b7) and the absolute (p T ) correction steps are required to correct for the variation in jet energy response in pseudorapidity and the transverse momentum consecutively. There are also additional optional corrections that take into account jet response variations in electromagnetic energy fraction and in flavor (e.g., light quark, b, c or gluon). Corrections due to soft interactions involving spectator partons and offset due to electronic noise and pile up are also optional. The factorized approach allows to study and optimize each correction separately. For the results shown in this article only required jet corrections are applied to the uncorrected jet energy as illustrated in the Equation 1. For example with conservation of transverse momentum in a 2 to 2 process, known as p T balance, one of the two final state objects can be measured relative to the other final state object which serves as the reference. CMS employs p T balance in dijet events, \u03b3 + jet events, and Z + jet events, to determine jet energy corrections using collider data. Due to the limited statistics, jet corrections in CMS are for the moment still derived using Monte Carlo truth information from the detector simulations and in-situ corrections are used for verifying the consistency of these simulation results. A systematic uncertainty of \u223c 10% on the jet energy is achieved and with the expected increase in statistics, more precise corrections will become available.",

The ratio of the measured CMS measurements to the PYTHIA tunes are presented in the lower inset. The extended kinematic reach is due to the large hard scattering cross-sections at of p+p collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the large full azimuthal acceptance of the silicon tracker and most importantly the excellent HLT triggering capabilities.

The systematic uncertainties are shown as yellow bands and NLO predictions are shown as solid red lines 12 . For better visibility the spectra for the given rapidity regions are multiplied by arbitrary factors as indicated in the legend. PFJ extends the kinematic range to much lower jet p T due to the improved jet resolution. The jet results agree with the theoretical prediction and with each other within the uncertainties of the measurements. The high level triggering capability on jets in CMS extends the kinematic reach of measured inclusive jets to large transverse momenta and efficiently composes the whole spectrum down to very low p T by utilizing multiple trigger streams. Many jet observables are explored with CMS due to this large kinematic reach. Some examples are search for di-jet resonances in the di-jet mass distributions 16 , hadronic event shapes 17 , dijet azimuthal decorrelations and angular distributions 18 , and the underlying event studies 19 .",

The second step is measuring the diffuse noise (< p T > per unit area in the remainder of the event) and noise fluctuations. These fluctuations in the background can distort the jet spectrum towards larger p T which can be corrected through an unfolding procedure (i.e., deconvolution).
