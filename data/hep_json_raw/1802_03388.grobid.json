This decay is presumed to occur via an intermediate state which contains one or two on-shell, promptly decaying bosons: H \u2192 ZX/XX \u2192 4 , where X is a new vector boson Z d or pseudoscalar a with mass between 1 and 60 GeV. The search uses pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV. No significant excess of events above Standard Model background predictions is observed; therefore, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on modelindependent fiducial cross-sections, and on the Higgs boson decay branching ratios to vector and pseudoscalar bosons in two benchmark models.",

            "text": "Following the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a comprehensive programme of measurements of the properties of this particle is underway. These measurements could uncover deviations from the expected branching ratios for the decays of a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson or allow for the possibility of decays into non-SM particles. Existing measurements constrain the non-SM or \"exotic\" branching ratio of the Higgs boson to less than approximately 30% at 95% confidence level (CL) [3][4][5]. Exotic Higgs boson decays have been proposed as a way to search for evidence of new physics. Due to the extremely narrow decay width of the Higgs boson predicted by the SM, the addition of even a small coupling to a new light state could open up sizeable new decay modes. In addition, new particles may couple preferentially to the Higgs boson since it provides a possible \"portal\" for hidden-sector particles to interact with SM particles [6][7][8][9]. Such decays are predicted by many theories of physics beyond the SM. For example, they are predicted in theories with a hidden (\"dark\") sector [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] and in those with an extended Higgs sector such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [20][21][22][23][24]. They are also predicted in several models of dark matter [25][26][27][28][29][30], models that explain astrophysical observations of positron excesses [31][32][33], models with a firstorder electroweak phase transition [34,35], and theories with neutral naturalness [36][37][38]. The processes under study here are referred to as pp \u2192 H \u2192 ZX/XX \u2192 4 , with Z being the SM Z boson and with X representing a possible new vector boson Z d or a new pseudoscalar boson a. Section 2 provides an introduction to the theoretical background and specific models examined in this paper.",

Same-flavour decays of the new particle to pairs of electrons and muons are considered, giving rise to the 4e, 2e2\u00b5, and 4\u00b5 final states for particles in the mass range from 15 GeV to m H /2, where m H = 125 GeV. For lower masses, targeting the range from 1 GeV to 15 GeV, only the 4\u00b5 final state is explored. Final states including \u03c4 leptons are not considered in either mass range.

In the first BSM benchmark model, the SM is extended with a dark-sector U(1) group, denoted U(1) d , leading to the appearance of a BSM vector boson, Z d . In the second BSM benchmark model, there are two Higgs doublets and an additional singlet scalar field (2HDM+S). This leads to the appearance of a BSM pseudoscalar boson, a. The Z d boson and the a pseudoscalar could each comprise the intermediate state in the decays H \u2192 ZX \u2192 4 and H \u2192 XX \u2192 4 , where the first benchmark model is considered for a higher mass range and the second for a lower mass range.",

The darksector states allow a theoretically plausible route for generation of the particle content necessary to account for the astrophysical evidence of dark matter. For example, fermionic dark-matter candidates [30] or dark-sector couplings to normal matter might explain astrophysical observations of positron excesses [31][32][33]. A dark sector is introduced with an additional U(1) d dark gauge symmetry [14][15][16][17][18][19], coupled to the SM through kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge field [41][42][43]. The gauge boson of the symmetry is the Z d vector boson. In this hypercharge portal scenario, the kinetic mixing parameter controls the coupling strength of the dark vector boson to SM particles, which in turn determines the lifetime of the Z d boson. The branching ratios of the Z d are independent of the kinetic mixing strength and are instead determined by the gauge coupling. This coupling leads to a significant fraction of decays (\u2248 15%) to pairs of electrons or muons. For Z d masses between 1 GeV and 60 GeV, the decay would be prompt (relative to the vertex resolution of the ATLAS detector) for 10 \u22125 [14]. For smaller values of , the displaced decays provide a unique signature, which has been previously searched for with the ATLAS detector in 8 TeV collisions [44]. For Z d masses below a few GeV and small values of , the decay products would be highly collimated and require a special analysis [45]. Another possibility involves a mass mixing between the Z boson and Z d , facilitating the decay of the Z d to SM particles. In this mechanism, the strength of the mixing is determined by mass mixing parameter \u03b4 [16,17].",

The branching ratios of a into fermions are determined by the Yukawa couplings of a to fermions, and lead to a rich decay phenomenology [15], albeit with typically negligible branching ratio to pairs of electrons, and smaller branching ratios to pairs of muons than the dark vector bosons described in the previous section. Among all the models predicting different decay possibilities, type II are theoretically well motivated, 3 since light pseudoscalars can correspond to the R-symmetry limit of the NMSSM [57,58], which elegantly solves the \u00b5-problem of the MSSM [59] and greatly reduces the fine-tuning and little-hierarchy problems. Furthermore, in the NMSSM the branching ratio for H \u2192 aa can be significant. Type-II models can also predict a significant branching ratio for a \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5, especially in the range 2m \u00b5 < m a < 2m \u03c4 , with values ranging from 10 \u22122 to 10 \u22121 for some regions of the parameter space [15].",

The ID covers |\u03b7| < 2.5 and consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector, and a transition radiation tracker. The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. One significant upgrade for Run 2 is the presence of the insertable B-layer (IBL) [66], an additional pixel layer close to the interaction point, which provides high-resolution measurements at small radius to improve the tracking performance. The calorimeter system features a high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter that measures the energy and the position of electromagnetic showers within |\u03b7| < 4.9. LAr sampling calorimeters are also used to measure hadronic showers in the endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) regions, while an steel/scintillator tile calorimeter measures hadronic showers in the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The MS surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, each with eight coils, a system of precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7), and fast trigger chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.4). For Run 2 the ATLAS detector has a two-level trigger system. The first-level trigger (Level-1 trigger) is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger (called high-level trigger) that reduces the rate of events recorded to 1 kHz.",

Its momentum is computed from the cluster energy and the direction of the track. Electrons are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.47 and p T > 7 GeV. Electrons can be distinguished from other particles using several identification criteria that rely on the shapes of electromagnetic showers as well as tracking and track-to-cluster matching quantities. Following the description in ref. [70], the output of a likelihood function taking these quantities as input is used to identify electrons, choosing the loose working point, but with the additional requirement of a hit presence in the innermost layer of the ID. 5 A muon is reconstructed by matching a track or track segment reconstructed in the MS to a track reconstructed in the ID [71]. Its momentum is calculated by combining the information from the two systems and correcting for energy deposited in the calorimeters. In regions of limited coverage by the MS (|\u03b7| < 0.1), muons can be reconstructed by matching ID tracks to calorimeter signals consistent with a minimum-ionising particle (calorimetertagged muons). In regions outside the ID acceptance (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.7), muon reconstruction can also be extended by using tracks in the MS (stand-alone muons). Reconstructed muons are required to pass the requirements of the loose working point to maximise the reconstruction efficiency while providing good-quality muon tracks [71]. Muons are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.7 and p T > 5 GeV. Calorimeter-tagged muons must have p T > 15 GeV.",

A separation of \u2206R > 0.10 (0.20) is required for all possible pairings of same-flavour (different-flavour) leptons in the quadruplet. Quadruplets are removed if an alternative same-flavour opposite-sign dilepton mass is less than 5 GeV. Then the loose calorimeter-and track-based isolation as well as impact parameter requirements explained in section 4.2 are imposed on the leptons. As the four leptons should originate from a common vertex point, a requirement on the \u03c7 2 value of a commonvertex fit is applied, corresponding to a signal efficiency of 99.5% for all decay channels. If more than one quadruplet passes the selection, the channel with the highest expected signal rate is selected, in the order: 4\u00b5, 2e2\u00b5, 2\u00b52e and 4e. At this point only one quadruplet remains. In order to improve the four-lepton mass reconstruction, final-state radiation photons arising from any of the lepton candidates in the quadruplet are added to the 4 system using the same strategy as in ref.

VVV/VBS: higher-order electroweak processes (with cross-sections proportional to \u03b1 6 at leading order) include triboson production and vector-boson scattering, which lead to four leptons in the final state, with two additional particles (quarks, neutrinos, or electrons and muons). These processes were modelled by Sherpa 2.1.1 with the CT10 PDFs. Higgs boson production through VBF is subtracted from the estimates obtained with this event generator, in order to avoid double-counting this process in final background estimates.

The choice of p T thresholds for the templates was carefully studied and it is required that the first (second) dimuon pair always passes the high-p T (low-p T ) selection. Estimations with alternative p T threshold selections were found to be compatible with the current prescription. The Higgs boson mass requirement described in section 4 introduces a correlation between the dimuon pairs and therefore a correction to the two-dimensional template is necessary. This correction is extracted from data using a sample enriched in events with heavy flavour quarks, with inverted isolation and vertex requirements. The final template covers the full m 34 vs m 12 plane, including the signal region (defined by the condition m 34 /m 12 > 0.85). The normalisation of the template is computed in the region with m 34 /m 12 < 0.85, and its effect propagated to the signal region. The heavy flavour processes are negligible in the high-mass region, while they account for 22% of the total prediction in the low-mass region.",

The fiducial selections were chosen to mimic the analysis selections described in sections 5.2 and 6.2. The leptons are \"dressed\", i.e. in order to emulate the effects of quasi-collinear electromagnetic radiation from the charged leptons on their experimental reconstruction in the detector [116], the four-momenta of all prompt photons within \u2206R = 0.1 of a lepton are added to the four-momentum of the closest lepton. For the H \u2192 XX search the efficiencies (shown in figure 8a) are estimated with the Z d Z d benchmark model and were verified to be compatible with the aa benchmark model to within 3% across the whole mass range. For the ZX search the efficiencies (shown in figure 7a) are estimated with the ZZ d benchmark model, but no verification was explicitly made to confirm if these efficiencies are valid for a Za process. Assuming that the verified compatibility between efficiencies of Z d Z d and aa processes applies equally to ZZ d and Za processes, upper limits on the cross-sections corresponding to these fiducial phase spaces should be applicable to any models of 125 GeV Higgs boson decays to four leptons via one (with an associated Z boson) or two intermediate, on-shell, narrow, promptly decaying bosons. The fiducial requirements are applied to the four leptons in this decay. These efficiencies are used to compute 95% CL upper limits on the cross-sections in the fiducial phase spaces defined for the H \u2192 ZX \u2192 4 and H \u2192 XX \u2192 4 searches. These model-independent limits are computed using the CL s frequentist formalism [117] with the profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic [118] (systematics are represented with nuisance parameters which are then profiled in the calculation of the test statistic). The results are shown in figures 7b and 8b, respectively. Impact of the systematic uncertainties on the limits is small.",

The data correspond to a combined integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The searches explore the final state consisting of four leptons (electrons or muons) produced from the prompt decays of the intermediate boson states. The search targeting the ZX intermediate state is sensitive to Z d masses between 15 and 55 GeV, and the search targeting the XX intermediate state is sensitive to Z d masses between 15 and 60 GeV. Intermediate states of XX (X = a or Z d ) where the boson mass m X is between 1 and 15 GeV (excluding masses near known dilepton resonances from quarkonium states) are searched for in events with four muons. The data are found to be globally consistent with SM background predictions. Upper limits (dependent on the mass of the intermediate exotic boson) are set on the branching ratio of Higgs boson to ZZ d , Z d Z d , and aa, corresponding to B(H \u2192 ZZ d ) \u2248 0.1%, B(H \u2192 Z d Z d ) \u2248 0.01%, and B(H \u2192 aa) \u2248 1% respectively (depending on mass range).",

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The transverse momentum pT and other transverse variables, are defined as the variables' component in the x \u2212 y plane, the transverse energy ET is defined as m 2 + p 2 T , where m represents the mass of a considered object. The distance in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal-angle space is defined as dR or \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .",
