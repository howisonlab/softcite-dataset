The data were obtained using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a centre-ofmass energy of 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . Distributions of the charged-particle multiplicity and of the charged-particle transverse momentum are measured in regions of the azimuth defined relative to the Z boson direction. The measured distributions are compared with the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators which implement different underyling event models. The Monte Carlo model predictions qualitatively describe the data well, but with some significant discrepancies.",

            "text": "A typical proton-proton ( pp) collision studied at the LHC consists of a short-distance hard-scattering process and accompanying activity collectively termed the underlying event (UE). The hard-scattering processes have a momentum transfer sufficiently large that the strong coupling constant is small and the cross-section may be calculated perturbatively in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The driving mechanisms for the production of the UE are at a much lower momentum scale. These mechanisms include partons not participating in the hard-scattering process (beam remnants), radiation processes and additional hard and semi-hard scatters in the same pp collision, termed multiple parton interactions (MPI). Phenomenological models are required to describe these processes using several free parameters determined from experiment. In addition to furthering the understanding of the proton's internal structure and the related soft-QCD processes, accurate modelling of the UE is crucial for many data analyses at a hadron collider, either to precisely determine Standard Model quantities or to search for new particles and interactions.",

However, there are observables which are sensitive to the UE properties, as first introduced by the CDF Collaboration in proton-antiproton ( pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.8 TeV [1]. An example of such an observable can be defined by topological considerations, based on the activity measurement in the direction transverse 1 to a reference object. The object in the event with the leading transverse momentum relates the UE activity to the scale of the momentum transfer in the hard interaction. In general, processes with leptonic final states like Drell-Yan events are experimentally clean and theoretically well understood, allowing reliable identification of the particles from the UE. The absence of QCD final-state radiation (FSR) permits a study of different kinematic regions with varying transverse momenta of the Z boson due to harder or softer initial-state radiation (ISR).",

            "text": "Events containing two muons originating from the decay of a singly produced Z boson form a particularly interesting sample for studying the UE. The final-state Z boson is wellidentified and colour neutral, so that interaction between the final-state leading particle and the UE is minimal. Gluon radiation from the quarks or gluons initiating the hard scatter are, however, an important consideration as these give the remainder of the event a non-zero transverse momentum and change the kinematics of the final-state. Observables are therefore measured in different regions of the transverse plane, which are defined relative to the direction of the Z boson as illustrated in Fig. 1. A charged particle lies in the away region if its azimuthal angle relative to the Z boson direction | \u03c6| is greater than 120 \u2022 . This region is heavily dominated by the hadronic recoil against the Z boson from initial state quark/gluon radiation and is therefore not particularly sensitive to the UE. The toward (| \u03c6| \u2264 60 \u2022 ) and transverse (60 \u2022 < | \u03c6| \u2264 120 \u2022 ) regions contain less contamination from the hard process after subtraction of the two muons from the Z boson. The transverse region is sensitive to the UE because, by construction, it is perpendicular to the direction of the Z boson and hence is expected to have a lower level of activity from the hard-scattering process than the away region. The two transverse regions are differentiated on an event-by-event basis by their scalar sum of charged-particle p T . The one with the larger sum is labelled trans-max and the other transmin [5,6]. The trans-min region is highly sensitive to the UE activity because it is less likely that activity from recoiling jets leaks into this region.",

The latter option tunes the event generator to the p Z T measurement at \u221a s = 7 TeV [19]. Hence, it retunes the overall UE activity by adjusting the Pythia MPI cut-off parameter to the UE activity of the previous measurement [2] in the lowest p Z T bin (0 to 5 GeV). Photos [20] was used to simulate  [21], which has an independent implementation of the parton shower, hadronization, UE and FSR. The Sherpa samples utilize the NNPDF30NNLO PDF set [22] and were generated with the nominal tune set of version 2.2.0. The Sherpa generator uses leading-order matrix elements with a model for MPI similar to that of Pythia 8 but without interleaving the FSR. It implements a cluster hadronization model similar to that of Herwig++. Sherpa and Pythia impose the infrared cut-off for MPI as a smooth function. In contrast, Herwig++ implements it as a step function. A signal sample produced with the MC generator Herwig++ [23] using the UE-EE-5 tune [24] provided by the generator's authors and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDF set is compared with unfolded data in Sect. 7. This tuning uses energy extrapolation and was developed to describe the UE and double parton interaction effective cross-section. Herwig++ uses, similarly to Pythia, a leading-logarithm parton shower model matched to leadingorder matrix element calculations, but it implements a cluster hadronization scheme with parton showering ordered by emission angle.",

First, the unfolding procedure for all observables in all measurement bins is repeated for three intervals of \u03bc , namely [8][9][10], [11][12][13] and [14][15][16]. A mismodelling of pile-up in MC simulations would manifest itself less in the interval of 8 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 10 and more in the interval of 14 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 16. The unfolded results for the three intervals are found to be fully compatible within their associated statistical uncertainties, confirming the consistency of the handling of pile-up in the unfolding process. Secondly, a complementary data-driven technique based on the Hit Backspace Once More (HBOM) method [42] is used. The intention is to reproduce pile-up contaminations as realistically as possible. Hence, the track information associated with non-primary vertices in the data is bundled to form a pile-up library. A random sample is drawn from this library and used as an example of pile-up effects in data. If this random sample is added to an individual event, the pile-up effect increases. A sampling of the library is subsequently used to pollute events with additional pile-up. Six iterations of pollution are applied, i.e. up to six random samples from the pile-up library are added to each event. Then the observables are constructed from these additionally contaminated events. Assuming the values of the observables evolve smoothly with each iteration of additional pile-up, an extrapolation in each bin to the value with zero pile-up vertices yields the HBOM estimate of pile-up subtracted data. The data are subsequently unfolded using a version of the Powheg+Pythia signal MC samples without pile-up vertices. The results obtained using this method are consistent with the nominal procedure, and no additional uncertainty is assigned. The uncertainty associated with the unfolding technique is evaluated using a data-driven method. It accounts for the dependence of the unfolding on the usage of prior knowledge from the MC simulation, i.e. the particle level quantities. The ratio of data to simulation at detector-level is evaluated and smoothed for each observable. The smoothed ratio is then used to reweight the simulations by applying the event-weight according to the particle level quantity. The reweighted detector-level distribution is then unfolded using the regular response matrix. The relative difference between the reweighted particle-level distribution and the reweighted and unfolded detector-level distribution is treated as a systematic uncertainty. This dependence on prior knowledge from the MC simulation is the dominant systematic uncertainty in most distributions at lower values of p Z",

An additional method of estimating the uncertainty related to the unfolding is to unfold the detector-level MC distributions generated with Sherpa using the unfolding matrices based on the Powheg+Pythia MC sample. The results are compared with the particle level quantities predicted by Sherpa. After taking the uncertainty due to the MC prior into account, a slight discrepancy between the unfolded Sherpa sample and the particle-level distributions remains. Therefore, an additional contribution to the MC prior uncertainty is introduced to cover this remaining non-closure of the unfolded result and the Sherpa generator level. In general, it does not exceed the 2-4% level and is smoothed over the full range of the observable. In a few cases, this non-closure component dominates the MC prior uncertainty.

The MC prior uncertainty is one of the largest contributors to the total sys-tematic uncertainty at all values of p T and in each p Z T region. The statistical uncertainty of the data rises with increasing p Z T , contributing a significant fraction of the overall uncertainty. The breakdown of the individual sources of uncertainties for the four observables, p T , N ch , p T , and mean p T is illustrated in Fig. 2 for the example of events with 10 < p Z T < 20 GeV in the trans-min region (the region most sensitive to the UE), inclusively in T \u22a5 . Figure 3 shows the systematic uncertainties in the arithmetic mean of the N ch and p T spectra in the trans-min region as a function of p Z T inclusively in T \u22a5 . The largest contributions to the total systematic uncertainties of the mean distributions at all p Z T values come from either the MC prior uncertainty or the track-related uncertainties. The statistical uncertainties of the data become large for p Z T greater than around 200 GeV.   While the toward region provides insights of similar importance for tuning MC generators after having removed the two muons, the discussion focuses on the trans-min region to better facilitate comparison with previous measurements. The UE activity in the toward region is higher compared with that in trans-min. This is expected since the trans-min region is defined as the subregion of the transverse region with the lower activity and for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events the UE activity is expected to be of similar magnitude in the toward and transverse regions. The trans-min region is statistically less affected by radiation and it is essentially the region where the contribution from ISR is subtracted. Apart from this difference in the amount of activity, the predictive performance of the different MC generators is comparable in the toward and trans-min regions. No significant difference in the predictive power between these regions is observed. Both N ch and p T measured in the trans-min are compared with previous measurements of the UE in Z boson events at lower centre-of-mass energies. Figures 4 and 5 show the unfolded p T spectrum, N ch , p T , and mean p T for the trans-min region inclusively in T \u22a5 for events with p Z T between 10 and 20 GeV and between 120 and 200 GeV. The predictions from Powheg+Pythia, Sherpa, and Herwig++ are compared with the data. The ratio of prediction to data is shown beneath each plot. None of the tested MC generators describes all aspects of the data well and in some regions the differences exceed the 70% level. Generally, the MC generators predict a higher number of particles with small p T than is observed in data (see top left of Figs. 4, . This is consistent with the MC predictions tending to lower values of mean p T , as is shown on the lower right plots of Figs. 4 and 5. The largest differences between data and simulation are at low N ch and low p T , and arise due to the steeper transverse momentum spectrum of charged particles in MC simulations. Powheg+Pythia and Sherpa predict a higher fraction of events with fewer charged particles and a consistently smaller sum of p T . However, Herwig++ slightly overestimates the fraction of particles with p T > 2.5 GeV and is qualitatively closer to the shape of the distributions of N ch and p T . With rising p Z T , the data p T spectrum becomes harder, and N ch , p T , and mean p T increase. The relative discrepancy remains the same in comparisons with the generator predictions.",

The trans-min region is further separated by T \u22a5 in the right plots of Fig. 8. In the trans-min region, the UEsensitive variables N ch and p T rise slowly with increasing Z boson transverse momentum. In contrast, the observables in the trans-max region have a strong dependence on p Z T . This is because it is heavily contaminated with the Z boson hadronic recoil leaking into the transverse region. The slope of the UE activity in the trans-min region as a function of p Z T for events of high T \u22a5 is similar to the inclusive measurement. The total amount of activity measured in the trans-min region for events with high T \u22a5 is lower than the inclusive measure-ment due to the correlation of activity in the transverse region and T \u22a5 . Furthermore, the right-hand plots of Fig. 8 demonstrate that the UE activity is higher for events with lower T \u22a5 , as expected [8]. Lower values of T \u22a5 also increase the dependence on p Z T in the trans-min region. The MC modelling of individual measurements in all 96 phase-space regions is further investigated by comparing the measured arithmetic means of the N ch , p T , and mean p T as functions of p Z T . Figures 9 and 10 show comparisons with the predictions of Powheg+Pythia, Sherpa, and Herwig++ for the trans-min and towards regions inclusively in T \u22a5 . The predictions fail to describe the data in either of the regimes. For p Z T > 20 GeV, Herwig++ predicts a slower rise in UE activity with rising p Z T than in the measured distributions. On the other hand, Powheg+Pythia and Sherpa qualitatively describe the 'turn-on' effect of the UE activity, i.e. a steeper slope at low p Z T which vanishes at higher values of p Z T . For Powheg+Pythia, the rise of the UE activity is underestimated, and hence the discrepancy with data grows with p Z T and stabilizes around p Z T = 100 GeV. Only in the toward region of the mean of the mean p T is Sherpa in good agreement with the data.",

In contrast to the other generators, Herwig++ fails to reproduce the turn-on effect at low p Z T as it predicts that the UE activity decreases as a function of p Z T when considered only in the p Z T < 20 GeV region. Otherwise, all generators underestimate the activity of the UE when quantified as the arithmetic mean of the observables for inclusive T \u22a5 . The generators predict the mean values better in comparison with the data when focusing on the MPI-sensitive regions. Powheg+Pythia8 is in agreement with data within the uncertainties for N ch and p T , indicating an adequate handling of the MPI activity. However, since the predictive power shrinks for the region with T \u22a5 \u2265 0.75 in comparison with the inclusive measurement, the simulation of contributions other than MPI to the UE activity needs to be improved. Reference [8] points out that the region with T \u22a5 > 0.75 is dominated by extra jet activity, giving a first indication for a possible improvement of the MC generator prediction. This conclusion is valid when focusing on Powheg+Pythia8 for different regions of T \u22a5 for individual bins of p Z T . In comparison with the measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV [2], the performance of Herwig++ is consistent for p Z T > 20 GeV. Both measurements use the energy-extrapolation tunes [24] provided by the Herwig++ authors, i.e. UE-EE-3 for \u221a s = 7 TeV and in the analysis presented here UE-EE-5. The latter tune was additionally validated against Tevatron and LHC measurements at \u221a s = 900 GeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV [44]. The prediction of Herwig++ is slightly better for the distributions of N ch and p T at higher values of p Z T . In the previous measurements, the divergence increased with p Z T , which might be related to improper modelling of the impact parameter. Apart from overestimating the mean activity, Herwig++ improved relative to the \u221a s = 7 TeV measurements in the description of the shape of dN ev /d( p T /\u03b4\u03b7\u03b4\u03c6), dN ev /d(mean p T ), and dN ev /d(N ch /\u03b4\u03b7\u03b4\u03c6) in the presented p Z T -bins.
