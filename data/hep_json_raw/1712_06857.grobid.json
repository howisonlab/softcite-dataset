Major systematic uncertainties due to the modelling of the jet energy scale and b-tagging efficiency are constrained by separating selected events into three disjoint regions. In order to reduce systematic uncertainties in the most important background, the W + jets process is modelled using Z + jets events in a data-driven approach. The inclusive tt cross-section is measured with a precision of 5.7% to be \u03c3 inc (tt) = 248.3 \u00b1 0.7 (stat.) \u00b1 13.4 (syst.) \u00b1 4.7 (lumi.) pb, assuming a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV. The result is in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. The crosssection is also measured in a phase space close to that of the selected data. The fiducial cross-section is \u03c3 fid (tt) = 48.8 \u00b1 0.1 (stat.) \u00b1 2.0 (syst.) \u00b1 0.9 (lumi.) pb with a precision of 4.5%. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

Given that its Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson is close to unity, it may play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking [1,2]. Studies of top-quark production and decay are major research goals at the LHC, providing both a precise probe of the Standard Model (SM) [3] and a window on physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) [4]. The LHC supplies a large number of top-quark events to its major experiments, offering an excellent environment for such studies.",

The QCD scale uncertainties are determined as the maximum deviation in the predicted cross-section for the six probed variations following a prescription referred to as independent restricted scale variations. Here the renormalisation scale (\u03bc r ) and the factorisation scale (\u03bc f ) are varied independently to half the default scale and twice the default scale omitting the combinations (0.5\u03bc def r , 2.0\u03bc def f ) and (2.0\u03bc def r , 0.5\u03bc def f ). The uncertainties due to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and \u03b1 S are calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [14] where the uncertainties of the MSTW2008 68% CL NNLO [15,16], CT10 NNLO [17,18] and NNPDF 2.3 [19] PDF sets are added in quadrature to the \u03b1 S uncertainty.

A high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter with lead absorbers provides the measurement of electromagnetic showers within |\u03b7| < 3.2. In the ID acceptance region, |\u03b7| < 2.5, the innermost layer has a fine segmentation in \u03b7 to allow separation of electrons and photons from \u03c0 0 decays and to improve the resolution of the shower position and direction measurements. Hadronic showers are measured by a steel/plastic-scintillator tile calorimeter in the central region, |\u03b7| < 1.7, and by a LAr calorimeter in the endcap region, 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. In the forward region, measurements of electromagnetic and hadronic showers are provided by a LAr calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity range 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The MS combines trigger and high-precision tracking detectors, and allows measurements of charged-particle trajectories within |\u03b7| < 2.7. The combination of all ATLAS detector subsystems provides chargedparticle tracking, along with identification for charged leptons and photons, in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events [31]. A hardware-based first-level trigger uses a subset of detector information to bring the event rate below 75 kHz.

The h damp parameter, which controls the transverse momentum, p T , of the first emission beyond the Born configuration, was set to m top . The main effect of this is to regulate the highp T gluon emission against which the tt system recoils. Parton shower (PS), hadronisation and the underlying event were simulated with Pythia (v6.428) [37] and the Perugia2011C set of tuned parameters [38]. For systematic studies of the tt process, alternative event generators and variations of the tuned parameter values in Pythia are used. The Powheg-Box event generator, using the same configuration as the nominal sample, interfaced to Herwig (v6.5.20) [39] is used for hadronisation-modelling studies, while MC@NLO (v4.09) [40,41] interfaced to Herwig is used to study the dependence on the matching method between the next-to-leading-order (NLO) matrix element (ME) generation and the PS evolution. In the case of events showered by Herwig, the Jimmy (v4.31) [42] model with the ATLAS AUET2 [43] set of tuned parameters were used to simulate the underlying event. Variations of the amount of additional radiation are studied using events generated with the Powheg-Box + Pythia event generators after changing the scales in the ME and the scales in the parton shower simultaneously. In these samples, a variation of the factorisation and renormalisation scales by a factor of 2 was combined with the Perugia2012radLo parameters and a variation of both scale parameters by a factor of 0.5 was combined with the Perugia2012radHi parameters [38]. In the second case, the h damp parameter was also changed and set to twice the top-quark mass [44].",

            "text": "Electrons Electron candidates are reconstructed by matching tracks in the ID to energy deposits (clusters) in the electromagnetic calorimeter [58]. Selected electrons are required to satisfy strict quality requirements in terms of shower shape, track properties and matching quality. Electron candidates are required to be within |\u03b7| < 2.47, and candidates in the calorimeter barrel-endcap overlap region, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, are excluded. Electrons from heavy-flavour decays, hadronic jets misidentified as electrons, and photon conversions are the major backgrounds for highp T electrons associated with a W -boson decay. The suppression of these backgrounds is possible via isolation criteria that require little calorimeter activity and a small sum of track p T in an \u03b7-\u03c6 cone around the electron. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter isolation variable is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of calorimeter energy deposits within the cone, corrected by subtracting the estimated contributions from the electron candidate and from the underlying event and pile-up contributions. The track isolation variable is defined as the scalar sum of all track transverse momenta within the cone, excluding the track belonging to the electron candidate [59]. Thresholds are imposed on the EM calorimeter isolation variable in a cone of size R = 0.2 around the electron and on the track isolation in a cone of size R = 0.3. The isolation requirements imposed on the electron candidates are tuned to achieve a uniform selection efficiency of 90% across electron transverse energy E T and pseudorapidity \u03b7. The electron pseudorapidity is taken from the associated track. Muons Muon candidates are reconstructed by combining MS tracks with tracks in the ID, where tracks in the MS and ID are reconstructed independently [60]. The final candidates are required to be in the pseudorapidity region of |\u03b7| < 2.5. A set of requirements on the number of hits in the ID must also be satisfied by muon candidates. An isolation requirement [61] is applied to reduce the contribution of muons from heavy-flavour decays. The isolation variable is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks originating from the primary vertex with p T above 1 GeV, excluding the one matched to the muon, within a cone of size R iso = 10 GeV/ p T (\u03bc), where p T (\u03bc) is the transverse momentum of the muon. Muon candidates are accepted when the value of the isolation variable divided by the p T (\u03bc) is smaller than 0.05. Jets Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm [62] implemented in the FastJet package [63] with a radius parameter of 0.4, using topological clusters calibrated with the local cell weighting (LCW) method [64] as inputs to the jet finding algorithm. The energies of the reconstructed jets are calibrated using p T -and \u03b7-dependent factors that are derived from MC simulation with a residual in situ calibration based on data [65]. In addition, a pile-up correction is applied to both the data and Monte Carlo (MC) events to further calibrate the jet before selection [66]. To reject jets likely to have originated from pile-up, a variable called the jet vertex fraction (JVF) is defined as the ratio of p T,i\u2208PV of all tracks in the jet which originate from the primary vertex to the p T,i of all tracks in the jet. Only tracks with p T > 1 GeV are considered in the JVF calculation. Jets with |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T < 50 GeV are required to have |JVF| > 0.5.",

            "text": "One of the most important selection criteria for the analysis of events containing top quarks is the one that identifies jets likely to contain bhadrons, called b-tagging. Identification of b-jets is based on the long lifetime of b-hadrons, which results in a significant flight path length and leads to reconstructable secondary vertices and tracks with large impact parameters relative to the primary vertex. In this analysis, a neural-network-based algorithm is used at a working point corresponding to a btagging efficiency in the simulated tt events of 70%, a c-jet rejection factor of 5 and light-flavour jet rejection factor of 140 [67]. Missing transverse momentum The missing transverse momentum is a measure of the momentum of the escaping neutrinos. It also includes energy losses due to detector inefficiencies, leading to the mismeasurement of the true transverse energy E T of the detected final-state objects. The missing transverse momentum vector, E miss T , is calculated as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of reconstructed and calibrated physics objects, i.e. electrons, muons and jets as well as energy deposits in the calorimeter which are not associated with physics objects [68]. The magnitude of the missing transverse momentum vector is defined as E miss T = | E miss T |. A procedure to remove overlaps between physics objects is applied, where jets overlapping with identified electron candidates within a cone of size R = 0.2 are removed from the list of jets, as the jet and the electron are very likely to correspond to the same physics object. In order to ensure the selection of isolated charged leptons, further overlap removals are applied. If electrons are still present with distance R < 0.4 to a jet, they are removed from the event. Muons overlapping with a jet within R < 0.4 are discarded from the event.",

The calorimeter isolation requirement is inverted, while keeping the total energy loss of the muon in the calorimeters below 6 GeV, and the requirement on the impact parameter is omitted. The additional application of all other event selection requirements mentioned in Sect. 5 results in a sample that is highly enriched in fake muons from multijet events, but contains only a small fraction of prompt muons from Z -and W -boson decays. The yield of the multijet background in the muon-triggered data sample is estimated from a maximum-likelihood fit to the m T (W ) distribution using the template determined from the selected multijet events in the data sample. A different fit observable (m T (W )) in the muon channel is used, since it provides a better modelling of the multijet background than the E miss T observable used in the electron channel. In both methods to obtain the multijet background normalisation, the multijet template is fitted together with templates derived from MC simulation for the tt and W + jets processes. The tt and W + jets rate uncertainties, obtained from theoretical cross-section uncertainties, are accounted for in the fitting process in the form of constrained normalisation factors. The rates for Z + jets, single-top-quark processes, and V V pro-cesses are fixed to the predictions as described in Sect. 3. For the fits in SR2 and SR3, the W + jets process is fixed as well, since the predicted yield is very small in these signal regions. The resulting fitted rate of tt events is in agreement within the statistical uncertainty with the result of the final estimation of the tt cross-section and therefore does not bias the result.

In the case of two real solutions, the one with the lower | p z (\u03bd)| is chosen. In the case of complex solutions, which can occur due to the finite E miss T resolution, a fit is performed that rescales the neutrino p x and p y such that the imaginary radi-cal vanishes, at the same time keeping the transverse components of the neutrino's momentum as close as possible to the x-and y-components of E miss T . To reconstruct the semileptonically decaying top quark, the four jets with the highest p T are selected and the one with the smallest R to the charged lepton is chosen to be the b-jet. The semileptonically decaying top quark is then reconstructed by adding the four-momentum of the W boson and the chosen b-jet. The  hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed by adding the four-momenta of the remaining three highestp T jets. Seven observables are finally chosen as input variables to the NN (see Table 2). The choice was made by studying the correlations between the potential input variables and choosing the ones with small correlations that still provide a good separation between the signal and the background events. The NN infrastructure consists of one input node for each input variable plus one bias node, eight nodes in the hidden layer, and one output node, which gives a continuous output o NN in the interval [0, 1].

A large uncertainty in the JES originates from the a-priori unknown relative fractions of quark-induced and gluon-induced jets in a generic sample, which is normally assumed to be (50 \u00b1 50)%. In this analysis, the actual fraction of gluon-induced jets is estimated in simulated events, which leads to a reduction in the uncertainty of these components by half. The fraction of gluon-induced jets is obtained, considering all selected jets apart from b-jets and it is between 15% to 30% depending on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet. The uncertainty in this fraction is estimated by comparing different tt samples, namely Powheg-Box + Pythia, Powheg-Box + Herwig, and MC@NLO + Herwig as well as samples with varied scale settings in the Powheg-Box + Pythia set-up. To estimate the systematic uncertainty of the JES, a parameterisation with 25 uncorrelated components is used, as described in Ref. [65]. For the purpose of the extraction of the tt crosssection, a single correction factor for the JES is included in the fit as a nuisance parameter (see Sect. 9). In this procedure, the dependence of the acceptance and the shape of the m( j j) template distribution on the JES is parameterised using the global JES uncertainty correction factor corresponding to the total JES uncertainty. Figure 5 shows the effect of a \u00b11\u03c3 change in the global JES correction factor on the m( j j) distribution. When estimating the systematic uncertainty in the tt cross-section due to the JES in the statistical procedure, all 25 components are considered and evaluated as described in Sect. 9.",

            "text": "The total uncertainty in both the inclusive and the fiducial tt cross-section is presented in Table 4 and is estimated to be 5.7% for the inclusive measurement and 4.5% for the fiducial measurement. The breakdown of the contributions from individual, or categories of, systematic uncertainties are also listed. In this case, only the considered source or group of sources is varied in the generation of the pseudo-experiments. The largest uncertainty in the inclusive measurement is due to the uncertainty in the PDF sets and the MC modelling of the signal process. The effects of uncertainties in the JES and the b-tagging efficiency have been significantly reduced by including them as nuisance parameters together with the chosen signal regions and discriminant distributions. Furthermore, the uncertainty due to additional radiation is reduced by a factor of three thanks to the inclusion of the m( j j) distribution in the analysis. For the fiducial cross-section measurement, the uncertainties in the MC modelling and PDF sets are reduced. The uncertainty in the tt cross-section due to the PDF sets is largest for events which are produced in the forward direction, i.e. one initial gluon has a high Bjorken-x value. The PDFs for high-x gluons have large uncertainties in all current PDF sets. Selecting events in the fiducial volume reduces the fraction of such events significantly and therefore the uncertainty is reduced significantly as well. In the   The ratio of observed to predicted (Pred.) number of events in each bin is shown in the lower histogram. Events beyond the x-axis range are included in the last bin case of the MC modelling, the uncertainty due to additional radiation is reduced more than the parton-shower and NLOmatching uncertainties, since varying the amount of radiation leads to similar changes in the selection efficiencies of the fiducial and reconstructed volumes and therefore to smaller uncertainties in the tt cross-section.",

Using an artificial neural network, the separation between the signal and background processes is improved compared to using single observables. Additionally, the analysis makes use of a data-driven approach to model the dominant W + jets background. It is modelled from collision data by converting Z + jets candidate events into a W + jets sample.",
