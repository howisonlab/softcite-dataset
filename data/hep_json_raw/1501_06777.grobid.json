            "text": "In neutral meson systems, mixing may occur between the particle and anti-particle states. This mixing is very small in the charm-meson (D 0 ) system. Experimentally, a small, non-zero D 0 -D 0 mixing is now firmly established by several experiments [1][2][3][4][5][6], where the average of these measurements excludes zero mixing at more than 11 standard deviations [7]. This opens up the possibility to search for a breaking of the charge-parity (CP ) symmetry occurring in the D 0 -D 0 mixing alone or in the interference between the mixing and decay amplitudes. This is called indirect CP violation and the corresponding asymmetry is predicted to be O(10 \u22124 ) [8,9], but can be enhanced in theories beyond the Standard Model [10]. Indirect CP violation can be measured in decays to CP eigenstates such as the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + (the inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied hereafter) from the asymmetry between the effective D 0 and D 0 lifetimes, A \u0393 . The effective lifetime is the lifetime obtained from a single exponential fit to the decay-time distribution. Several measurements of A \u0393 exist [1,11,12]. The most precise determination was made by LHCb with data corresponding to 1.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, resulting in A \u0393 (K \u2212 K + ) = (\u22120.035 \u00b1 0.062 \u00b1 0.012)%, and A \u0393 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (0.033 \u00b1 0.106 \u00b1 0.014)% [11]. When indirect CP violation is assumed to be the same in the two modes, the world average becomes A \u0393 = (\u22120.014 \u00b1 0.052)% [7]. In all previous measurements of A \u0393 , the initial flavour of the neutral charm meson (i.e., whether it was a D 0 or D 0 state) was determined (tagged) by the charge of the pion in a D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decay. In this paper, the time-dependent CP asymmetry is measured in D 0",

In order to present a single systematic uncertainty, the effect of the scale uncertainty is evaluated with a Neyman construction [35]. For each true value of A \u0393 , the absolute size of the scale uncertainty is known and added in quadrature to the constant uncertainty. In this way, a confidence belt of observed values versus true values is constructed. This procedure gives a slightly asymmetric systematic uncertainty, which is +0.026 \u22120.034 % for the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + decay channel and +0.025 \u22120.033 % for the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay channel. Except for the contribution from the mass fit model, all contributions to the systematic uncertainty are fully correlated, resulting in an overall correlation coefficient of 89% between the systematic uncertainties of A \u0393 (K \u2212 K + ) and A \u0393 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ).",

Changing to a finer decay-time binning yields compatible results. Potential effects on the measurement of A \u0393 coming from detection asymmetries are expected to appear when dividing the data set by magnet polarity and data-taking period. Detection asymmetries originating from a left-right asymmetric detector change sign when reversing the magnet polarity. Similarly, during the two data-taking periods, detection asymmetries and production asymmetries might have changed due to different running conditions. As shown in figure 4, there is no significant variation of A \u0393 across various configurations. Also splitting the data set according to the number of primary vertices or in bins of the B decay time does not show any deviation in the measured values of A \u0393 .",

Assuming that indirect CP violation in D 0 decays is universal [10], and accounting for the correlation in the systematic uncertainties, the average of the two measurements becomes A \u0393 = (\u22120.125 \u00b1 0.073)%. The results in this paper are uncorrelated with the time-integrated asymmetries reported in ref. [13]. The results are consistent with other A \u0393 measurements [1,11,12], and independent of the A \u0393 measurements [11] from LHCb using D 0 mesons from D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays.
