The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic \u03c4 decay and missing transverse momentum, as well as a hadronically decaying top quark, resulting in the absence of high-transverse-momentum electrons and muons. The data are found to be consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction, \u03c3 (pp \u2192 [b]t H \u00b1 ) \u00d7 BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd), between 1.9 pb and 15 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 200 to 2000 GeV. The exclusion limits for this search surpass those obtained with the proton-proton collision data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

Charged Higgs bosons 1 appear in several non-minimal scalar sectors, where a second doublet [3] or triplets [4][5][6][7][8] are added to the SM Higgs doublet. The observation of a charged Higgs boson would therefore clearly indicate physics beyond the SM.",

Similarly, generic symbols are used for their decay products. of a charged Higgs boson at the LHC is expected to be in association with a top quark [18][19][20]. The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. When calculating the corresponding cross section in a four-flavour scheme (4FS), b-quarks are dynamically produced, whereas in a five-flavour scheme (5FS), the b-quark is also considered as an active flavour in the proton. For modeldependent interpretations, 4FS and 5FS cross sections are averaged according to Ref. [21]. In two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), the production and decay of the charged Higgs boson also depend on the parameter tan \u03b2, defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and the mixing angle \u03b1 between the CP-even Higgs bosons.

For the generation of tt pairs and single top quarks in the W t-and s-channels, the Powheg-Box v2 [33,34] generator with the CT10 [35,36] PDF set in the matrix-element calculations is used. Electroweak t-channel single-top-quark events are generated using the Powheg-Box v1 generator. This generator uses the 4FS for the NLO matrix-element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10F4. For this process, the top quark is decayed using MadSpin [37], thereby preserving all spin correlations. For all backgrounds above, the parton shower, the fragmentation and the underlying event are simulated using Pythia v6.428 [38] with the CTEQ6L1 [39] PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 (P2012) tune [40]. 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points The top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV for all relevant background and signal samples. The tt cross section is calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), including soft-gluon resummation to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) order, with Top++ v2.0 [41][42][43][44][45][46][47]. The single-top-quark samples are normalised to the approximate NNLO cross sections [48][49][50]  [60]. All simulated signal and background samples are processed through a simulation [61] of the detector geometry and response using Geant4 [62]. Finally, they are processed through the same reconstruction software as the data.",

In the following, jets are required to have a transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. A multi-variate technique (Jet Vertex Tagger) relying on jet energy and tracking variables to determine the likelihood that a given jet originates from pile-up [65] is applied to jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Jets arising from b-hadron decays are identified by using an algorithm that combines impact parameter information with the explicit identification of secondary and tertiary vertices within the jet into a b-tagging score [66,67]. The minimal requirement imposed on the b-tagging score in this analysis corresponds to a 70% efficiency to tag a b-quark-initiated jet in tt events, with rejection rates of 400 for light-quark-initiated jets, 27 for \u03c4 had -initiated jets and 8 for c-quark-initiated jets, enhanced with respect to Run 1 by the use of the IBL and an improved algorithm. The tagging efficiencies from simulation are corrected based on the results of flavour-tagging calibrations performed with data [68].",

This background is estimated with a data-driven method that relies on the measurement of the rate at which jets are misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis , hereafter referred to as the fake factor (FF). For this purpose, a control region populated primarily with misidentified \u03c4 had-vis candidates is defined by using the same requirements as for the signal region, except that E miss T < 80 GeV and that the number of b-tagged jets is zero. The FF is defined as the ratio of the number of misidentified \u03c4 had-vis candidates fulfilling the nominal object selection to the number of misidentified \u03c4 had-vis candidates satisfying an \"anti-\u03c4 had-vis \" selection. This anti-\u03c4 had-vis selection is defined by inverting the \u03c4 had-vis identification criteria while maintaining a loose requirement on the BDT output score, which selects the same kind of objects mimicking \u03c4 had-vis candidates as those fulfilling the identification criteria. In order to account for differences between gluon-, light-quark-and b-quark-initiated jets, FFs are parameterised as functions of p T , the type of \u03c4 had decay via the measured number of charged and neutral particles (\u03c0 0 ) [70], and the b-tagging score, as illustrated in Fig. 2. For each type of \u03c4 had decay, the threshold value for the b-tagging score of the \u03c4 had-vis candidate is optimised to keep enough entries in each of the two bins, below and above the threshold. After correcting for \u03c4 had-vis candidates not fulfilling the identification criteria but matching a true \u03c4 had at generator level, the number of events with a misidentified \u03c4 had-vis in the signal region (N \u03c4 had-vis fakes ) is derived from the subset of anti-\u03c4 had-vis candidates as follows:",

The parameterisation of the efficiency shows a small dependence on the identification criteria (loose versus nominal) for the electron and the \u03c4 had-vis candidate, as well as on the minimum number of jets chosen for the control region. This results in small variations of the measured fit function. These variations, as well as the limited statistical precision of the bins used for the fit function and the resulting parameterisation, are accounted for as systematic uncertainties. In the signal region, the total systematic uncertainty arising from the E miss T trigger efficiency measurement is about 2%. In the estimation of backgrounds with jets misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis , the dominant systematic uncertainties arise from the level of contamination of \u03c4 had-vis objects matching a true \u03c4 had decay at generator level and fulfilling the anti-\u03c4 had-vis selection (varied by 50%), from the statistical limitation due to the control sample size and from the requirement on the BDT score in the anti-\u03c4 had-vis control sample. When changing the latter, different fractions of gluon-and quark-initiated jets populate the anti-\u03c4 had-vis control region. The event topology (in particular the shape of the E miss T and \u03c6 \u03c4 ,miss distributions) also depends on the requirement imposed on the BDT score. The corresponding systematic uncertainty is assessed by considering the shape of the m T distribution obtained for two alternative cuts on the BDT score, which are symmetric around the nominal cut value.

The uncertainty arising from the QCD scale is obtained by varying the factorisation and renormalisation scale up and down by a factor of two. The largest variation of the signal acceptance is then symmetrised and taken as the scale uncertainty, 4-8% depending on the H + mass hypothesis. The variation of the signal acceptance with various PDF sets is estimated using LHAPDF [84], but is found to be negligible for all signal samples. Finally, the impact of A14 tune variations on the signal acceptance is estimated by adding in quadrature the positive and negative excursions from a subset of tune variations that cover underlying-event and jet-structure effects, as well as different aspects of extra jet production. This uncertainty amounts to 8-10% and is of the same order as the sum in quadrature of the detector-related systematic uncertainties for the H + signal samples.",

The statistical analysis is based on a binned likelihood function for this distribution. All systematic uncertainties from theoretical or experimental sources are implemented as nuisance parameters. The parameter of interest (or signal strength) \u03bc \u2261 \u03c3 (pp \u2192 [b]t H \u00b1 ) \u00d7 BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd), and the nuisance parameters are simultaneously fitted by means of a negative log-likelihood minimisation. Expected limits are derived using the asymptotic approximation of the distribution of the test statistic [86]. Fig. 5 shows the m T distribution obtained after a fit with the background-only hypothesis, together with the m T distributions corresponding to two H + mass hypotheses: 200 and 1000 GeV. The binning shown in Fig. 5 is also used in the statistical analysis. The SM predictions are found to be consistent with the data, and exclusion limits are set on \u03c3 (pp \u2192 [b]t H \u00b1 ) \u00d7 BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) by rejecting the signal hypothesis at the 95% confidence level (CL) using the CL s procedure [87]. Fig. 6 shows the observed and expected exclusion limits. They agree within the uncertainties over the explored H + mass range. The observed limits range from 1.9 pb to 15 fb in the mass range 200-2000 GeV. For the largest charged Higgs boson mass hypotheses, the exclusion limits show very little dependence on m H + , as there is only one bin entering the fit for m T > 500 GeV. The impact from the various sources of systematic uncertainty on the expected 95% CL exclusion limits are summarised in Table 2, for H + mass hypotheses of 200 and 1000 GeV. The impact of the systematic uncertainties reported in Section 5 only represents the relative change in event yields. In the limitsetting procedure, however, m T shape variations are also taken into account, leading to a different relative importance of the various systematic uncertainties. Those with a large impact over the ex-  plored mass range are the \u03c4 had-vis identification and energy-scale uncertainties, the tt background modelling uncertainties, and the statistical precision in the estimation of the background with a jet misidentified as a \u03c4 had-vis . For the larger H + mass hypotheses, the signal modelling uncertainties also have a significant impact. The total uncertainty is dominated by the statistical uncertainty.",
