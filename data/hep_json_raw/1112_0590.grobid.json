            "text": "In 1977 Jaffe [2] predicted a six quark state, H-dibaryon, with hypercharge (Y ) = 0 and strangeness (S) = 2 to be stable against strong decay, but not to weak decay. Recent lattice QCD calculations from HAL [3] and NPLQCD [4] collaborations indicate existence of a bound H for pion mass above the physical mass. The coalescence model predicted H-dibaryon production rate ranges from 10 \u22122 -10 \u22124 [5,6] for Au+Au collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV. It has been proposed that the H would appear as a bump in the \u039b\u039b invariant mass spectra if H is a resonance state, or it would lead to a depletion of the \u039b\u039b correlation near the threshold if H is weakly bound, which can be used to probe whether there is a stable H or resonance. In addition to H-dibaryon there are other six quark states with higher strangeness content are predicted: \u039e\u039e (S = 4) [7], \u2126\u2126 (S=6) [8]. Various experiments have explored the \u039b\u039b [9], \u03a3p [10] and \u039bp\u03c0 [10,11] invariant mass spectrum to look for H-dibaryon signal, but statistics were too low to arrive at any conclusion about its existence.",

            "text": "In heavy ion collisions hyperon-hyperon interactions can be studied by measurement of the two hyperon correlation functions. Two particle correlation functions provide a powerful tool to extract dimensions of the emitting source from which these particles are produced . If the hyperons are produced in early stage of fireball expansion, they will be localized near the center of the system and the measured dimension of the system would be 2-3 fm. However the measurement of hyperon-hyperon correlation function is challenging because of their low production cross-section. Recently STAR has collected unprecedented high statistics data for Au+Au collision at RHIC, which provides a unique opportunity to look for the exotic particles, like H-dibaryon and \u039b\u039b correlations. GeV. \u039b identification and momentum determination were carried out with Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The decay channel \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 with branching ratio 63% was used for particle identification. Protons and pions are identified by using specific ionization energy loss (dE/dx) in the TPC gas. The \u039b candidates were formed out of a pair of positive and negative tracks whose trajectories point to a common secondary decay vertex which was well separated from the primary vertex. All candidates having invariant mass from 1.112-1.12 GeV/c 2 have been considered. The decay length of \u039b candidate was asked to be more than 5 cm and the distance of closest approach from the primary vertex was taken to be less than 0.4 cm. Based on this conditions, the invariant mass distribution of the \u039b(\u039b) in 0-5% centrality is shown in figure 1, where black line(red line) is for \u039b(\u039b) candidates, with excellent signal to background ratio.",

The correlation between real \u039b and a fake \u039b candidate reconstructed from a pair that shares a daughter with the real \u039b candidate was rejected by removing pair of \u039b with same daughters. The effect from splitting of daughter tracks is explored by looking at the angular correlation between the normal vectors to the decay planes of the \u039b in a given pair.

The other p\u03c0 pair is required to be the hypothetical \u039b, which decays at least 3.5 cm (d \u039b ) away from the H vertex and its mass is in the range 1.112-1.12 GeV/c 2 . The other p\u03c0 pair mass was required to be less than 1.110 GeV/c 2 . To connect \u039b vertex to H decay vertex, the angle between the line defined by H and \u039b vertices and \u039b direction (\u03b8 \u039b ) is constrained to be smaller than 3 deg.
