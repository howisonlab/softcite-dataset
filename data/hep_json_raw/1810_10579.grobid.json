It is therefore widely believed to be an effective field theory that describes interactions near the TeV scale. A plethora of strategies exist to extend the standard model, many of which contain predictions of new particles or dynamics that could manifest in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As of now, none have been observed, and much of the available phase space for natural solutions to outstanding problems is excluded. If new physics exists, it is therefore either heavy (i.e. above the reach of current searches) or hidden (i.e. currently indistinguishable from standard model backgrounds). We summarize the existing searches, and discuss future directions at the LHC.",

            "text": "Particle physics is at a crossroads. The standard model (SM) explains a wide range of phenomena spanning interactions over many orders of magnitude, yet no demonstrated explanation exists for a variety of fundamental questions. Most recently, the discovery of the Higgs boson [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] at the ATLAS [10] and CMS [11] detectors has addressed the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, but there is no explanation for why the scale of its mass is so much different from naive quantum-mechanical expectations (the \"hierarchy problem\") [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. Dark matter (DM) remains an enigma, despite extensive astronomical confirmation of its existence [21][22][23]. Neutrino masses are observed to be nonzero [24][25][26][27], and elements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix [28,29] have been measured, but these masses are not easily accounted for in the SM [30]. Unification of the strong and electroweak forces is expected, but not yet observed nor understood [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]; such models often predict the existence of yet-tobe-observed leptoquarks (LQs) or proton decay [45]. Furthermore, there are unexpected observations that are not explained in the SM, such as the baryon asymmetry [46], anomalies in the decays of bottom-quark hadrons [47], a with highly Lorentz-boosted SM particles that result in collimated, massive jets (\"boosted hadronic jets\"); and (4) signatures involving resonances that decay to lower-mass states, which must be Lorentz-boosted via initial-state radiation (ISR) to be detected (\"ISR boosted\").",

The LHCb experiment has slightly different goals, i.e. to precisely measure bottom and charm hadron production, decays, and properties, as well as other particles with long lifetimes. Of course, many models of new physics manifest in SM-like signatures with different kinematic decays, or at different rates, compared with their SM counterparts. Considerable effort must occur to ensure optimal performance of the detectors, triggers, object reconstruction, calibration, etc. A thorough discussion of the experimental challenges facing the LHC experiments is beyond the scope of this paper, however we will highlight a few key ideas that are used in searches for BSM physics that look qualitatively similar to SM production.",

Due to the confinement and asymptotic freedom of the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) interaction, the fragmentation and hadronization occur primarily in a collimated spray of particles called \"jets\" [58]. They are reconstructed from different inputs (depending on the detector) using the fastjet software package [59,60]. The ATLAS collaboration utilizes primarily topological clustering of their calorimeter deposits (TC) [61], or occasionally a full reconstruction of the particle flow throughout the detectors (PF) [62], while CMS utilizes PF almost exclusively except where noted [63]. The typical momentum resolutions and scale uncertainties achieved for both experiments are \u223c 10% and \u223c 0.5-1.0%, respectively, for p T = 100 GeV [62,64,65]. Jets containing bottom or charm hadrons can have some displaced particles within them, and ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb are able to discern very small displacements (a few tens of microns) with respect to the beam axis with dedicated tagging algorithms [66,67]. This allows the reconstruction of vertices a few hundred microns from the beam axis. Such information can be used to efficiently discriminate jets that originate from bottom or charm quarks from those that originate from lighter quarks or gluons.",

Firstly, the same strategy as the bottom and charm hadron detection can be used, whereby particles with long lifetimes will have large impact parameters with respect to the beam axis. For instance, in Refs. [76,77], the detectors can discern particles that decay tens of millimeters away from the beam axis. Secondly, signals of events in the calorimeters that occur outside the beam crossing can be used as in Ref. [78]. In this case, particles may be produced with long enough lifetimes to escape the inner detectors, becoming trapped by the nuclear material of the hadronic calorimeter, to decay some time later.

The former will be able to detect particles produced in LHC collisions that decay several hundred meters from the interaction point, which is the same scale as allowed values from constraints imposed by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [82,83]. The latter will be situated close to the beamline, downstream from LHC collisions, to detect long-lived particles that subsequently decay to lepton pairs. Such satellite experiments show strong promise in extending the reach of discovery of new particles with long lifetimes.",

If these particles have couplings to the heavier SM particles (and they must, if we are to produce them at the LHC), then often they contain couplings to top quarks and W/Z/H bosons. In these cases, due to the large difference in masses between the BSM particle and the SM particles, the latter will be produced with large Lorentz boosts. This causes the decay products of the unstable SM particles to be highly collimated. We refer to these as \"boosted objects\" [84][85][86][87][88][89].",

These black holes decay almost instantly into one or more particles at high p T , including signatures with photons, leptons, jets, or p T / . This provides a very unique signature at the LHC. For black hole masses far above M th (for instance, \u223c 4M th for n = 6) [101], the semiclassical approximation holds where quantum effects of individual gravitons can be neglected, and the black hole will decay uniformly to all SM particles (with quarks and gluons obtaining an enhancement from their 3 colors). The signature of such models contains a large number of high-p T particles, and so the sensitive variable will be the scalar sum of the p T of all of the jets, leptons, photons, and p T / . For black hole masses near M th , however, the semiclassical approximation is invalid, and quantum-mechanical decay to a few highly energetic particles is the dominant decay mode.  Figures 2-4 show the results of many searches involving high-multiplicity events or events with significant p T / . The mass limits depend on the signature, the model, and the number of extra dimensions, but are typically between 2-10 TeV. This covers a significant dynamic range of interest for these models for the case of n = 4 spatial dimensions, since models with considerably higher masses would be less likely to solve the hierarchy problem naturally.",

These models also result in KK excitations of the graviton [109] and gluon [110,111], which can yield signatures in many final states such as dibosons, diquarks, di-Higgs, diphotons, and many others. One common feature is the high masses of the KK excitations, which often subsequently decay to highly Lorentz-boosted SM particles, necessitating the usage of the techniques outlined in Sec. 2.3. Such models also can result in additional quarks and/or leptons that transform as vectors under the ordinary symmetry of the SM, referred to as \"vector-like\" quarks (VLQs) or leptons (  [160][161][162], and resonances decaying to VLQs [163]. Overall, the benchmarks used in these searches are RS1 KK gravitons, RS1 KK gluons (for tt resonances), or W bosons (for tb resonances). There are also other models that are probed with the dijet and bb resonance papers. The limits on these models are already quite stringent, effectively saturating the available parton luminosity at high masses in the multiple TeV range. There are also analyses that manifest as a combination of ISR boosts as in Sec. 2.4 and boosted hadronic jets as in Sec. 2.3, shown in Ref. [92] There are also many analyses searching for direct production of VLQs [116, [164][165][166][167][168][169][170][171][172][173][174].",

There may be a family of dark particles, even with their own interactions, that comprise the dark sector. The only real constraint we have is that if WIMPs exist, they interact weakly with SM particles. For this reason, more model-agnostic searches have become popular, with the help of effective field theories (EFTs) or simplified models of DM interactions [176]. These focus more on the signatures involving DM and place constraints simultaneously on the masses of the DM, and the mediator via which they interact with the SM particles. An exhaustive list of final states with spin hypotheses of the mediator can thus be made, and an extensive program has been undertaken to investigate these models.",

Some models postulate a non-abelian sector of light particles that interacts with the SM via a heavy mediator, thus becoming \"hidden\" or \"dark\". These particles could form complex bound states since they are strongly interacting, thus forming \"valley hadrons\" or \"v-hadrons\" analogous to QCD. The LHC could in principle produce these v-hadrons, which would subsequently decay to detectable SM particles through the massive mediators after a long time [179], resulting in observable SM particles that are displaced from the interaction point, analogous to a charged pion that decays to a muon and neutrino via a massive W boson. This necessitates utilizing the detection techniques outlined in Sec. 2.2. Furthermore, the decay products may also potentially be collimated, necessitating the techniques outlined in Sec. 2.3. The Higgs boson could in principle couple with the hidden sector, providing a \"Higgs portal\" [180]. The latter signature would be a Higgs boson produced and decaying into long-lived v-hadrons, which may or may not decay to SM particles within the detector acceptance.",

Simplified models, on the other hand, postulate various DM-SM mediators, as well as a DM particle, all with varying spins and couplings to the SM particles. Broadly speaking, these can both result in similar signatures. Overall, since any DM particles that are produced in LHC collisions will not interact with the detectors at all, detection techniques focus primarily on ISRboosted detection techniques as in Sec. 2.4, and reconstruct the observable interaction from ISR with traditional techniques as in Sec. 2.1 or with boosted hadronic jets as in Sec. 2.3. Depending on the final state, flavor tagging techniques to detect bottom or top quarks can also be used. As such, existing analyses include a dizzying array of final states [137,152,154,155,[185][186][187][188][189][190][191][192][193][194][195][196]. These are usually colloquially referred to as \"mono-X\" searches, since the signature in the detector is a single particle (X) recoiling against the DM particle. The particle X can be any SM particle. There are therefore searches with signatures of mono-jet, mono-bottom-jet, mono-top-jet, mono-photon, mono-W , mono-Z, mono-Higgs, etc. The mediators can also interact with a pair of particles, so signatures can also involve qq, + \u2212 , bb, tt, etc.",

One example is to search for first-or second-generation LQs coupling to first-or second-generation quarks and leptons. In those cases, analyses can estimate the background for such searches using the known rates of electroweak production of W and Z bosons, as well as top quark pair production. Another strategy is to search for third-generation LQs in signatures involving \u03c4 leptons, bottom or top quarks. The SM backgrounds for such signatures are dominated by top quark pair production, which can be predicted. The limits for LQs are currently on the order of 800-1500 GeV depending on the channel.",

Investigations of quark compositeness are not fundamentally different than the Rutherford experiment, and involve investigations of the number of high-mass quark-quark interactions. Since a massive mediator would often manifest as a contact interaction at lower energies (much like the W boson appears as a contact interaction in pion decay, etc), the searches often focus on such interactions. At its heart, the LHC is a QCD jet factory. As such, it can set extraordinarily sensitive limits on such fundamental interactions. The searches in Refs. [150,154,226], for instance, are able to set limits on composite scales between 10-20 TeV. The size of the quark is pointlike down to 10 \u221218 m, and the scale of contact interactions manifesting in dijet samples must be larger than the scale of the LHC center-of-mass energy.",
