Systematic uncertainties from the expected values has limited the sensitivity of this approach. Observation at multiple distances can remove the normalization uncertainty by isolating the distance dependence. This doesn't work for high \u2206m 2 sterile neutrinos since they are fully mixed at most observation distances and only shift the normalization of the flux. A compact intense source of neutrinos based on a subcritical fission reactor would permit observation of oscillations on submeter distance scales and clearly distinguish between a systematic normalization and the L/E dependence expected from oscillations.",

Evidence comes both from appearance, when the source is a muon neutrino and from observed event rates being below expectations, when the source is an electron neutrino. If one uses a neutrino oscillations framework to model the observations the short distances involved suggest a large mixing mass and the low transition rates suggest a small mixing angle. In this model the transition rate for electron neutrinos can be approximated by:",

Suggested values for \u2206m 2 es are about 1 eV 2 and sin 2 (2\u03b8 es ) = 0.1 [1]. So the approximation is good for short baseline experiments. The small value of sin 2 (2\u03b8 es ) suggests that high statistics are needed to see the effect and that systematic errors may dominate the measurement. Values as high as \u2206m 2 es > 5 eV 2 can be fit [1]. The interaction of MeV scale antineutrinos (such as from fission products) on hydrogen,\u03bd e + P \u2192 e + + N is a well understood process that lends itself to the background resistant delayed coincidence method where the neutron is measured after the initial neutrino interaction occurs to produce a positron. Almost all of the neutrino energy is carried by the positron so neutrino energy ambiguity is determined by detector resolution and not neutrino reaction kinematics.",

In the subcritical fission reactor, accelerator induced fission greatly amplifies the power injected and produces the neutron rich beta decay unstable fission products that are responsible for the antineutrinos produced at nuclear power stations. Unlike self sustaining chain reactions where the geometry and design require a large core, a subcritical source has some advantages. For example, cooling the source could be engineered to permit much shorter distance between the neutrino source and the detector. This minimum being determined by radiation shielding requirements. Backgrounds which are not beam associated can be measured by turning off the accelerator hence removing the neutrino source. Removing the source of neutrinos is rarely practical for commercial nuclear reactor operations.",
