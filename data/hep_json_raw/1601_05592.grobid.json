            "text": "There has been a great deal of theoretical work on sophisticated Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) neutrino interaction models in recent years, prompted by a number of experimental results which measured unexpectedly large CCQE cross sections on nuclear targets. As the dominant interaction mode at T2K energies, and the signal process in oscillation analyses, it is important for the T2K experiment to include realistic CCQE cross section uncertainties in T2K analyses. To this end, T2K's Neutrino Interaction Working Group has implemented a number of recent models in NEUT, T2K's primary neutrino interaction event generator. In this paper, we give an overview of the models implemented, and present fits to published \u03bd\u00b5 and \u03bd\u00b5 CCQE cross section measurements from the MiniBooNE and MINER\u03bdA experiments. The results of the fits are used to select a default cross section model for future T2K analyses, and to constrain the cross section uncertainties of the model. We find strong tension between datasets for all models investigated. Among the evaluated models, the combination of a modified relativistic Fermi gas with multinucleon CCQElike interactions gives the most consistent description of the available data.",

            "text": "Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) scattering (\u03bd \u00b5 + n \u2192 p + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is the dominant neutrino interaction process for muon (anti)neutrinos impinging on a nuclear target at neutrino energies on the order of 1 GeV. Because CCQE is a two-body process and the incoming neutrino direction is known for an accelerator experiment, a reasonable approximation of the neutrino energy can be cal-culated using only the outgoing lepton kinematics. Because of this, CCQE is the preferred signal process for neutrino oscillation experiments which generally require some handle on the incoming neutrino energy to extract neutrino oscillation parameters due to \u03bd ( -) \u00b5 disappearance or \u03bd ( -) e appearance in this energy region. However, nuclear effects and interactions which are not distinguishable from CCQE in the final state bias or smear the reconstructed neutrino energy, so a good understanding of these effects is important.",

            "text": "Neutrino interaction generators typically use the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model of the nucleus for all neutrino-nucleus interactions because of its simplicity. In the RFG model, all possible nucleon momentum states are filled up to the Fermi momentum, there is a constant binding energy required to separate the nucleon from the nucleus, and the neutrino interacts with a single bound nucleon. Neutrino-nucleon CCQE scattering for free nucleons is described by the Llewellyn-Smith formalism [1], which has been extended to cover neutrino-nucleus CCQE scattering in the Smith-Moniz RFG model [2], where nucleons bound within the nucleus are described by the RFG nuclear model. The only parameter of the weak current or in the RFG model which is not well constrained by electron scattering data [3,4] is the axial mass, M A . Results from a global analysis of neutrino-deuterium scattering experiments and pion electroproduction data find M A = 1.00 \u00b1 0.02 GeV/c 2 [5], which is consistent with other analyses [6][7][8]. These results are also consistent with high energy neutrino beam experiments on heavy nuclear targets [9].",

            "text": "Recent differential CCQE cross section results from the MiniBooNE collaboration [10,11] are significantly higher than expectation, which can only be accounted for in the framework of the Smith-Moniz RFG model by inflating the axial mass, giving rise to the term \"Mini-BooNE large axial mass anomaly\". A separate issue observed by both K2K [12] and MiniBooNE was a deficit of events at low Q 2 . K2K obtained an axial mass value of M A = 1.20 \u00b1 0.12 GeV/c 2 by fitting the d\u03c3/dQ 2 shape. The low-Q 2 region can also be modeled by an inflation of the axial mass, as increasing M A leads to suppression at low Q 2 as well as an enhancement at high Q 2 . However, the inflation of the axial mass required to model the low-Q 2 region is significiantly larger than the value required to model the increased event rate, so these two descrepancies in the data not consistent. Typically, the M A values quoted for from both K2K and MiniBooNE do not include the low-Q 2 region in the fit, or add additional parameters to model this region. Other experiments using heavy nuclear targets with beam energies in the few-GeV region have also measured cross sections which are consistent with an inflation of the axial mass [13][14][15][16], although these results do not paint a coherent picture. More recently, the MINER\u03bdA experiment [17,18], which is at a somewhat higher neutrino energy than MiniBooNE, has shown good agreement with the Smith-Moniz RFG model with M A = 1.00 GeV/c 2 , but requires an enhancement to the transverse component of the cross section, an effect also seen in electron-nucleus scattering [19]. These inconsistent results present a considerable challenge to neutrino oscillation experiments which need to be able to model their signal processes well.",

These models have a more realistic nucleon momentum distribution taking into account the shell structure of the nucleus and correlated pairs of nucleons within the nucleus, and have non-constant binding energies. Note that although these models include correlations between nucleons in the initial state, they still use the impulse approximation and only consider interactions with a single nucleon. More complex models which go beyond the simple picture of non-interacting fermions are available [27][28][29][30][31][32]. However, with the exception of the GiBUU interaction model [30,33], these are not currently implemented in neutrino interaction generators. In these models, a mean field potential due to the presence of other nucleons within the nucleus is calculated, which will generally depend on the position and momentum of the struck nucleon. These models are not discussed further as they cannot be easily implemented in the NEUT neutrino interaction generator [34] due to the models being computationally intensive, and therefore slow, and they may not be valid for the entire energy range required by the generator.",

            "text": "Although alternative nuclear models modify the cross section as a function of the outgoing lepton kinematics significantly, they do not change the total CCQE cross section significantly as a function of neutrino energy [21]. Additional nuclear effects are also likely to be required to explain the current global dataset. Multinucleon interaction (2p2h) models such as those from Martini et al. [35] and Nieves et al. [36,37] go beyond the impulse approximation and include diagrams where two nucleons are involved in the interaction. This kind of interaction adds significant strength to the CCQE-like cross section and explains the difference in normalization observed in the MiniBooNE data, which was previously modelled with a large axial mass [35,36,[38][39][40][41]. Because these 2p2h models are not two-body processes, they are expected to lead to significant biases in the neutrino energy reconstruction from the outgoing lepton which assumes CCQE kinematics [42][43][44][45][46]. Additionally, the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) is a nuclear screening effect that modifies the propagator for interactions in nuclear matter [35,36,[47][48][49] and has a significant effect on the differential cross section as a function of Q 2 , suppressing the cross section in the low-Q 2 region and enhancing the cross section for Q 2 > \u223c 0.5 GeV 2 . RPA needs to be included, both in interactions with a single nucleon (1p1h) and those from 2p2h calculations, to find good agreement with data. Note that both Nieves and Martini calculations are performed in the context of a local Fermi gas (LFG) model, where the Fermi momentum depends on the local nuclear density. Because these nuclear effects are nuclear model dependent, it is not necessarily easy to combine models of nuclear effects with new CCQE interaction models.",

            "text": "Whilst there have been rapid experimental and theoretical developments relating to CCQE cross sections, a limited number of new nuclear models and nuclear effects (such as 2p2h and RPA) have only recently been implemented into neutrino interaction generators or confronted with neutrino-nucleus scattering data, and no consistent picture has yet emerged. It is not clear which models fit the global data best, and where the deficiencies now lie, which should be a serious concern for neutrino oscillation experiments. This paper shows the effect of fitting current CCQE and multinucleon models to the MiniBooNE [10,11] and MINER\u03bdA [17,18] datasets to a variety of models implemented in NEUT by members of T2K's Neutrino Interactions Working Group (NIWG). Previous constraints on the CCQE model produced by the NIWG and used in T2K oscillation analyses only considered an RFG model, and recommended the NEUT default central value for the axial mass M A = 1.21 GeV/c 2 based on the value found by the K2K experiment [12], with an error large enough to cover fits to the MiniBooNE neutrino mode CCQE dataset [10], as is fully described in Reference [50]. This work improves on the previous situation by including more sophisticated effects proposed to explain the large axial mass anomaly, and by using all of the newly available CCQE data to constrain all model parameters without reference to the default NEUT model. The models which have been implemented in the NEUT generator are discussed in Section II and Section III discusses cross-generator validation. Section IV gives a brief overview of the MiniBooNE and MINER\u03bdA data used in the fit. The nominal NEUT predictions for these datasets are shown in Section V for a variety of models. Section VI discusses the fit procedure. The results of fake data studies and the fit to external data are given in Section VII. In Section VIII we interpret the results and discuss possible implications in cross section and neutrino oscillation analyses and Section IX summarizes the results.",

            "text": "The NEUT implementation of the SF model from Benhar and Fabrocini [23] is described fully in Reference [52]. Although SF is a generic term, in this work it will specifically refer to the Benhar SF. The model information is all encoded in the initial state nucleon distribution shown in Figure 1. Pauli blocking is implemented as a hard cut-off: final state nucleons with momenta less than the Fermi momentum p SF F are forbidden. There are two terms in the SF model: a short range correlation term, which extends to higher initial state nucleon momenta, and a mean field term, which contributes the main peak at lower momenta. These terms can be seen in Figure 2, where the two-dimensional SF in terms of the removal energy and initial state nucleon momentum has been projected on to the momentum axis. There are three parameters in NEUT which modify the SF as illustrated in Figure 2. The default values for these parameters are given in Table I. The mean field width and normalization of the correlation term are well-constrained by electronscattering data [52] and have little effect on the shape or normalization of the cross section. Thus, they are not considered further in this work. Pauli blocking is modified by changing the Fermi momentum in the fits. It should be noted that in the RFG model, the Fermi momentum defines the Pauli blocking, but also modifies the width of the initial state nucleon distribution. As a result, changing p RFG F affects a wide range of Q 2 , whereas changing p SF F only affects very low Q 2 events. The multinucleon-neutrino (2p2h) model from Nieves et al. [36,37] has been implemented in NEUT as described in Reference [53]. The cross section as a function of neutrino energy and the outgoing lepton kinematics was made available by the authors of the model and is implemented as a series of lookup tables for various nuclear targets and neutrino species. The tables provided had hadronic variables integrated out, so a generic model based on Reference [54] for simulating the initial and final hadronic states was used for generating NEUT events 1 . The discrepancy between the leptonic and hadronic simulation makes the current NEUT implementation of the Nieves model inadequate for comparisons with experimental measurements of the final state hadrons from CCQE events (such as can be found in Reference [55]). For this reason, only leptonic measurements are used in this analysis. As the Nieves model is very complex, the current NEUT implementation does not allow fundamental model parameters to be changed. For simplicity, only a simple scaling parameter which changes the normalization of 2p2h events has been considered in this analysis. Note that the Nieves 2p2h model included \u03c0-less \u2206 decay contributions, where a nucleon excited into a \u2206(1232) resonance decays without producing a pion [56,57]. Contributions from \u03c0-less \u2206 decay were previously implemented in NEUT and other generators, and have been treated as an intrinsic background in CCQE selections and corrected for. This leads to complications when comparing the full Nieves model to CCQE cross section measurements.",

Figure 3 shows the ratio of the Nieves 1p1h cross section with RPA included over the bare 1p1h cross section; these two-dimensional tables of the ratio were supplied by the authors of Reference [36] and are used to apply the RPA correction in NEUT. The Nieves RPA calculation uses the local Fermi gas nuclear model, and NEUT only has a global Fermi gas model implemented for 1p1h interactions, but the authors of the RPA calculation have noted [37] that the same ratio can be applied, with reasonable precision, to a global Fermi gas. Because of the model dependence, the same ratios cannot be applied to modify the 1p1h interactions calculated with a SF model, and no RPA calculation performed in the con-text of SF nuclear model is available. Two different RPA calculations are available from the same authors, termed relativistic and non-relativistic, which affect the quenching of the RPA at high Q 2 ( > \u223c 0.5 GeV 2 ). The ratio of non-relativistic to relativistic RPA is shown in Figure 4. Both RPA models are investigated in this analysis as it is not clear which model is expected to best fit the global dataset. In Reference [38], non-relativistic RPA corrections are used to compare with MiniBooNE neutrino mode data, whereas in Reference [37], the relativistic RPA correction was introduced to compare with the MINERvA datasets. The 'stray' points in Figures 3  and 4 are artifacts from the authors of the RPA model, who provided the data used to produce these figures. The cause of these artifacts is unknown, but as these points lie outside the kinematically allowed region of (E \u03bd , Q 2 ) space, they do not affect the RPA implementation in NEUT as no event outside this region can be generated.",

However, the Nieves model consistently uses a local Fermi gas, whereas NEUT uses a global Fermi gas model for the 1p1h calculation. Currently there is no ability to vary the value of M A used in the Nieves model prediction as implemented in NEUT, making the fits slightly inconsistent in this regard. We note that the value of the axial mass used for the 2p2h contribution to the cross section was fixed to M A = 1.01 GeV/c 2 in NEUT, which is slightly different to the nominal M A = 1.049 GeV/c 2 used in the Reference [36]. The SF+2p2h model has no RPA correction applied, which is physically inconsistent as the 2p2h enhancement is used (both corrections are due to complications in heavy nuclear targets). As previously noted, no RPA calculation appropriate for a SF model is currently available, so this inconsistency is unavoidable. The nuclear models used for the 1p1h calculation (SF) and the 2p2h calculation (LFG) are also inconsistent, and it has been remarked that the short range correlations included the SF nuclear model may be the same as some contributions to the Nieves 2p2h interaction model, so some contributions may be included twice.",

By default, NEUT events are generated with the non-relativistic RPA model. described in Reference [59], and is included for comparison with the other nominal models in Section V. The ESF enforces agreement with the longitudinal response function extracted from electron scattering data by modifying the initial state nucleon momentum distribution (using a simple parametrization of the Benhar SF model), and should be used with the Transverse Enhancement Model (TEM), which parametrizes the observed discrepancy between the longitudinal and transverse response functions extracted from electron scattering data as an enhancement to the magnetic form factor [19]. By construction, the ESF+TEM agrees with elastic electron scattering data, and is extended to neutrino scattering data by modifying the Llewellyn-Smith interaction formalism for nucleons bound in a nucleus described by the ESF (and with the modified magnetic form factor from the TEM). This model was implemented too late to be a candidate model for the T2K oscillation analysis, and is not considered further in the fitting work described in this paper.   We note that neither of our candidate models are expected to describe experimental data at low momentum transfer because they do not include nuclear effects such as nuclear excitations and collective resonances which will affect the cross section. In other analyses which fit models to CCQE data, bins which are dominated by low momentum transfer events are excluded [61]. In this analysis we have not followed any such bin masking procedure. Arguably, to obtain a realistic value of the model parameters, one should only fit the model in its stated region of validity. However, the main focus of this analysis is to obtain central values and errors for the T2K oscillation analysis, where the cross section model is used for all regions of phase-space, so some pragmatism is required.",

It was the first MC generator to have an implementation of the Benhar SF [23] and the Nieves 2p2h model included [36,37], and served as the benchmark for the NEUT development of both models. The implementation of the SF model in NuWro was based on the code written for Reference [63] and subsequently optimized for NuWro. The Nieves model implementation in NuWro used a series of lookup tables for the 2p2h cross-section as a function of leptonic variables for various nuclear targets and neutrino species so is very similar as in NEUT, although it has since been improved to use a more general formalism which depends on a number of nuclear response functions which can be extracted from the Nieves code, and therefore reduces the number of lookup tables required. The same generic model [54] was used to simulate the initial and final hadronic states in NuWro as was used in NEUT. For both the SF and Nieves 2p2h models, NuWro and NEUT are in good agreement, which provides a useful validation of the NEUT implementations of these models.",

The CCQE-like sample is obtained by selecting events in which a muon was detected with no pions, but no requirement was made on the proton. The CCQEcorrected measurement is produced by subtracting background events (where the primary interaction was not CCQE) based on the NUANCE [64] generator prediction. The dominant background is CC1\u03c0 + , and a dedicated sample was used to tune the NUANCE prediction which was used in the background subtraction. It should be noted that the NUANCE CC1\u03c0 + simulation included \u03c0-less \u2206 decay. The published signal purity for the neutrino dataset is 77%. CCQE-like results are less model dependent than CCQE-corrected results (as they do not rely on the experiment's own MC correction strategy), but make the analysis dependent on the simulation of the background in the MiniBooNE detector, which cannot be tuned to the MiniBooNE data in the same way MiniBooNE's background model could be. CCQE-corrected results are used in this analysis. A downside of using the CCQE-corrected data is the explicit subtraction of \u03c0-less \u2206 decay events in the MiniBooNE analysis, which forms part of the Nieves multinucleon-neutrino prediction which we treat as signal in the analysis. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to account for this effect, so we ignore it for the analysis presented.

There is also a large CC1\u03c0 \u2212 background, the analogue of the CC1\u03c0 + contamination in the neutrino dataset. Two properties are used to measure the \u03bd \u00b5 background [65]: 8% of \u03bd \u00b5 -induced CC interactions produce no decay electron due to muon-nucleus capture; and the \u03bd \u00b5 -induced CC1\u03c0 + events can be identified independently of\u03bd \u00b5 -induced CC1\u03c0 \u2212 as most \u03c0 \u2212 mesons are absorbed. Unfortunately, this property makes CC1\u03c0 \u2212 a bigger background to the CCQE analysis in antineutrino mode, and means that there is no sample with which to directly tune the CC1\u03c0 \u2212 production from the NUANCE resonance model, so the neutrino mode CC1\u03c0 + has to be used (as was done for the neutrino mode sample).

In particular, there is a significant difference between MiniBooNE and MINER\u03bdA data which forces the model parameters to compromise between the two, as well as a large change in the normalization for the MiniBooNE datasets. Although the M A value obtained from the fit to the RFG+rel.RPA+2p2h model is lower than that obtained from past fits of the RFG model to MiniBooNE data alone (see Reference [50] as an example), it is still inconsistent with that obtained in global fits to light target bubble chamber data or high energy heavy target data [60]. Additionally, the data requires a large supression of the nominal 2p2h model. The SF+2p2h model, in which the 2p2h component is completely suppressed, requires an inflated M A value to fit the data. This is unsurprising as the SF model alone does not significantly change the total cross section. Including an RPA calculation appropriate for the SF model is likely to reduce the tension with the 2p2h model, and is likely to change this conclusion significantly, this work will be revisited when such a calculation is available. Both fits also initially imply that there may need to be additional interactions used that may mimic CCQE interactions or change the shape of the distributions through additional, but currently unmodelled, effects in the nucleus.",

However, at the best fit point 2p2h is suppressed to 27% of the Nieves nominal value as shown in Table IX. This suppression is driven by MINER\u03bdA, which would completely suppress the 2p2h component of the model if MiniBooNE were not included in the fit [59]. As discussed, the cross section is smaller in low-Q 2 region than the model prediction. Therefore, the model parameters act to suppress the low-Q 2 region in the fit. The Nieves 2p2h model is concentrated in the low-Q 2 region as can be seen in Figure 6. As a result, the 2p2h contribution is largely suppressed and an inflation of the axial mass for the 1p1h contribution is favored. This leads to a positive correlation between the 2p2h normalization and M A parameters as shown in Figure 12. We see very similar results in a shape-only fit, indicating that the normalization disagreement which has previously led to an inflated axial mass is not responsible for the suppression of 2p2h normalization. For this reason, we are confident that the change in the normalization of the MINER\u03bdA cross section results expected from the flux reanalysis [72] will not significantly modify the conclusions of the fit.",

Because the current implementation of 2p2h in NEUT does not have the capability to separate out the contribution from \u03c0-less \u2206 decay, we have simply ignored this potential issue, as has also been done previously by the 2p2h model builders [35,36]. Better agreement between the model and data might be found if it were possible to separate physics processeses and to modify the shape of the 2p2h cross section in the fit. Future cross section measurements should be encouraged to focus on exclusive final states (CC0\u03c0) rather than initial state processes (CCQE), which will avoid such an issue in the future. Finally, as previously remarked, the RFG+RPA+2p2h model implemented in NEUT is not equivalent to the full Nieves model because the 1p1h component in NEUT uses a global, rather than local, Fermi gas nuclear model. The difference between the 1p1h models will be most pronounced in the low-Q 2 region, so it is possible that the 2p2h shape issue is due to a conflict with the 1p1h model, and that a more consistent LFG+RPA+2p2h model might alleviate this issue.",

An alternative measure of the goodness of fit, the PGoF, was used to try to improve the situation. Although the PGoF procedure still assumes Gaussian statistics, it highlights disagreements within the combined dataset by dividing the dataset into subsamples. These disagreements are completely hidden by the standard goodness of fit tests because the MiniBooNE \u03c7 2 contribution is so low relative to the number of degrees of freedom it contributes to the fit. The PGoF showed that there was considerably better agreement between the best fit parameter values obtained in fits to subsamples of the data for the RFG+rel.RPA+2p2h fit, which gives some confidence to the fit result. For the SF+2p2h model, the fits to subsamples of the data pulled to drastically different parameter values at the best fit points, which is highly undesirable behaviour if the fit results are to be used as prior uncertainties in oscillation analyses, and indicates that the model is a bad fit to the global dataset. But the SF+2p2h model can fit individual datasets well (as is clear in Table VIII), so should not be discounted completely.",

An unrealistically tight constraint on cross section parameters would lead to biases in the near de-tector fit for T2K. To circumvent this problem a PGoF error inflation procedure was defined to ensure that the 1\u03c3 parameter errors cover the disagreement between the MINER\u03bdA and MiniBooNE datasets. This is a conservative approach, but as no model seems able to describe all of the available data, such an approach was necessary. Such ad hoc procedures are necessary when incomplete information is available from some of the datasets included in the fit. The lack of information about binto-bin correlations for the MiniBooNE datasets significantly complicates this analysis, and may significantly change the results. We note that in the literature, many statements about how well various models agree with the MiniBooNE datasets are made which assume Gaussian statistics. It is clear that an appreciation of this issue is important for future model comparisons, and that the availability of complete information for new cross section results will be critical for building consistent CCQE models.",

For each model, the parameters that describe the data are fit, with both the SGoF and PGoF used to select the model that best describes the data. In this case, the RFG+rel.RPA+2p2h model is considered the best candidate, with M A = 1.15\u00b10.03 GeV/c 2 , the normalization on the 2p2h model 27 \u00b1 12%, and p F = 223 \u00b1 5 MeV/c. Tensions between the two experiments require an error scaling procedure outlined by the PGoF test, with the final result providing prior inputs into various future T2K analyses. This is the first time a comprehensive analysis has been performed with these models using a neutrino interaction generator and published, and the first time that such models have been be used in an oscillation analysis with full detector simulations [77].",

However, further theoretical development of these models requires the engagement of the experimental community, and so using them in our simulations is essential to move the field onwards.

The results from the CCQE fits presented here will also help inform the future model development required to fit the data. It is clear that alternative 2p2h models and fundamental parameters in the 2p2h model should be investigated, to see whether the disagreement with the 2p2h shape is telling us something meaningful about the Nieves model. It is also probable that the current RPA model is too inflexible, and this is partially responsible for the disagreement between Mini-BooNE and MINER\u03bdA data. Both of these problems may relate to the fact that for several years, the only neutrino data available for theorists to confront their models with was the MiniBooNE neutrino dataset, which is difficult to use due to the lack of correlations and the explicit subtraction of \u03c0-less \u2206 decay from the CCQE-corrected result. Converging on a new CCQE model which adequately describes all current and future data is likely to require several iterations between experimentalists and model builders. Confronting all the available models with a variety of data, as has been done in this analysis, and including these models in full Monte Carlo simulations, as will be done in T2K with the output from this analysis, is an important step in this cycle from the experimental side.",
