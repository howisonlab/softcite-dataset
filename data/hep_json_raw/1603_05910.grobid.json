The algorithm is based on matrix element (ME) techniques and achieves a relative resolution on the Higgs boson mass of typically 15-20%. A previous version of the algorithm has been used in analyses of Higgs boson production performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC Run 1. The algorithm is described in detail and its performance on simulated events is assessed. The development of techniques to handle \u03c4 decays in the ME formalism represents an important result of this paper.",

            "text": "A new boson of mass 125 GeV has been observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2]. The properties of the new particle are compatible with the predictions for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs ( H) boson [3][4][5][6][7][8] within the present experimental uncertainties [9][10][11][12]. The observation of its decay into a pair of \u03c4 leptons, at a rate that is compatible with the SM expectation, has been reported recently [13][14][15]. The decay into a pair of \u03c4 leptons allows for the most precise measurement of the direct coupling of the SM H boson to fermions. Decays of heavy resonances into \u03c4 lepton pairs furthermore provide high sensitivity to search for models with an extended Higgs sector, constituting an important experimental signature at the LHC.",

An important handle to separate the signal from the background is the mass of the \u03c4 lepton pair, which we denote by \u03c4\u03c4 m . The signal is expected to show up as a small bump on the high mass tail of the \u03c4\u03c4 m distribution of the background (see e.g. Figs. 8, 9, and 11 of Ref. [13]).",

These limits have been obtained by comparing the rates for off-shell versus on-shell H boson production and depend on certain assumptions. Direct, model independent, upper limits on the total H width, obtained by analyzing the mass spectra in \u2192 \u2192 \u2113 H ZZ 4 ( \u03bc \u2113 = e, ) and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H events, are \u22481 GeV .

The first variant allows to reconstruct the mass \u03c4\u03c4 m of the \u03c4 lepton pair. It has been developed within the paradigm of the matrix element (ME) method [32,33]. Whereas the algorithm described in Ref. [23] uses a likelihood function of arbitrary normalization, the improved algorithm is based on a proper normalization within the formalism of the ME method. The second variant of the improved algorithm uses a likelihood function of arbitrary normalization. The algorithm allows for the reconstruction of not only the mass \u03c4\u03c4 m of the \u03c4 lepton pair, but of any kinematic function of the two \u03c4 leptons, including the p T , \u03b7, \u03d5, and transverse mass of the \u03c4 lepton pair. A further improvement concerns the extension of the algorithm to account for the experimental resolution on the reconstruction of hadrons that are produced in the \u03c4 decays.",

The second variant of the algorithm is presented in Section 3. The performance of both variants of the improved algorithm in terms of achieved \u03c4\u03c4 m resolution is compared to the previous version of the SVfit algorithm, used during LHC Run 1, and to selected alternative mass observables in Section 4. The results are discussed in Section 5. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 6.",

The efficiency for an event originating at the phase space point p to pass the event selection, i.e.to end up with measured observables y for which \u03a9( ) = y 1, is denoted by \u0398 \u03f5( ) p, .

The best estimate for the unknown model parameter \u0398 is given by the value \u0398 which maximizes the probability density to observe precisely the values y that are measured in the detector.

The longitudinal component of p rec can be accounted for by a small adjustement of the Bjorken scaling variables x a and x b and does not cause a problem for modeling the H boson production by LO ME. However, the components of p rec in the transverse plane need to be accounted for. The LO ME that we use to model the production of the H boson is adequate for events in which the H boson has zero p T , implying the transverse components of p rec to be zero. In order to use the LO ME in analyses at the LHC, the momenta of the visible \u03c4 decay products and of the neutrinos produced in the \u03c4 decays need to be transformed into a frame in which the H boson has zero p T . The transformation is achieved by a Lorentz boost in the transverse plane, using \u239c vector. We denote the true values of energies and momenta by symbols with a hat if they are given in the laboratory frame, and by symbols a tilde in case they are given in the zero transverse momentum frame of the H boson. Symbols with neither hat nor tilde denote values measured in the laboratory frame. The hadronic recoil is reconstructed with a typical resolution of \u2212 10 20GeV at the LHC [48,49]. It is demonstrated in Ref. [47] that the imperfect reconstruction of the hadronic recoil in the detector may cause a significant bias on the H boson mass reconstructed by the ME method in case one ignores the experimental resolution on the hadronic recoil.

This is because the effect of the missing factor z 1 2 in the likelihood function used by the SVfitSA algorithm (cf. Section 3) is equivalent to using an artificial regularization term with \u03ba = 4. Regardless of the choice of \u03ba, the peaks of the \u03c4\u03c4 m distributions reconstructed by the different versions of the SVfit algorithm are close to the true value of the mass of the \u03c4 lepton pair in the 1-jet boosted and 2-jet VBF categories.
