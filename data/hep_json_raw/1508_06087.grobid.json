            "text": "In the Standard Model, CP violation in charm decays is expected to be small and hence potentially sensitive to contributions from New Physics. Although measurements of the time-integrated CP asymmetry in D 0 decays to pairs of charged mesons showed hints of CP asymmetry at the level of 0.7 %, the combined results are not yet conclusive [1][2][3][4][5]. Of particular interest, both for the search of New Physics and for the understanding of penguin contributions, are decays of D 0 mesons into a pair of neutral mesons, such as the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S [6,7]. 1 If the CP asymmetry in D 0 decays to charged mesons is confirmed and assuming moderate breaking of the SU(3) flavour symmetry, the CP asymmetry of this mode could be of O(1 %) or even larger [6]. From a more recent Standard Model based analysis of the contributing amplitudes, a 95 % confidence level upper limit of 1.1 % for direct CP violation in the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S has been derived [7]. The single previous measurement gave A CP = (23 \u00b1 19) % [8].",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 2 The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV.

            "text": "To further reduce combinatorial background a multivariate analysis (MVA) method [21,22] is used. It is based on a rule-based learner applying the methods of bagging [23] and instance weighting (see, e.g., refs. [24,25]). Separate samples have been used for training and testing, where simulated events have been used as signal proxy, while the background sample was a mixture of data from D 0 sidebands (the mass ranges 1764.84 \u2212 1844.84 MeV and 1884.84 \u2212 1964.84 MeV) and simulation. Kinematic quantities, decay time variables, geometric quantities, and fit quality variables are used as input to the MVA. The selection of variables and the training have been done separately for the different categories. For the MVA optimisation, the figure of merit S/ \u221a S + B is used, where S is the expected number of signal candidates in the signal region defined by a \u00b11.5 MeV window around the known \u2206m value [20], while B is the number of background candidates in the signal region. The optimal points have signal efficiencies of 95 %, 51 %, 47 %, and 37 %, and background retentions of 50 %, 0.33 %, 0.40 %, and 0.73 % for LLtrig, LL, LD, and DD, respectively. The large background retention for the LLtrig category is due to the fact that the dedicated trigger intrinsically has a much lower background level. The control channel D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + is selected by cuts on kinematic quantities, vertex quality variables, geometric quantities, and decay time variables. In addition, the same mass requirements and fiducial cuts on the slow pion are applied as in case of the signal channel. Due to the large number of control channel candidates, which is much larger than needed for this analysis, 1 % of candidates are accepted at random.",

The systematic uncertainty related JHEP10(2015)055 to the signal extraction is estimated by comparing the nominal fit with an alternative one, where outside of the signal region of \u00b11.5 MeV around the known \u2206m-value, only the background component is fitted. The signal yield is obtained by subtracting the background extrapolated into the signal region from the total observed yield. For the combined CP asymmetry a difference of 0.019 is found, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The systematic effects that arise due to the slow pion charge asymmetry in the detector and a possible charge asymmetry of D * production in pp collisions in the LHCb acceptance are determined using the control channel. However, the control channel contains charged kaons which introduce an additional detection asymmetry, as the interaction cross-sections of K + and K \u2212 with the detector material are different. In ref. [26], the charged kaon detection asymmetry has been measured to be in the range 0.008 to 0.012. Assuming the pion detection asymmetry to be negligible, and including possible trigger effects, a correction of \u22120.010 \u00b1 0.005 is applied to the observed asymmetry in the control channel, resulting in a corrected value of \u22120.009 \u00b1 0.005. The absolute value of this number and its uncertainty are added in quadrature and assigned as a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to production and detection asymmetries.",
