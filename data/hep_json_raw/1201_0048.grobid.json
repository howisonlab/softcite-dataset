Improvements of ALICE subdetectors are envisaged for the upgrade plans of year 2017. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is a proposal in view of this upgrade, motivated both by the possibility to increase the physics potential of the muon spectrometer and to allow new measurements of general interest for the whole ALICE physics. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this upgrade, a detailed simulation of the MFT setup is being performed within the AliRoot framework, with emphasis on the tracking capabilities as a function of the number, position and size of the pixel planes, and the corresponding physics performances. In this report, we present preliminary results on the MFT performances in a low-multiplicity environment.",

Within this program, currently active both in p-p and Pb-Pb collisions, three main directions can be identified: study of quarkonia production, 2 of open Heavy Flavors (HF) production, 3 of low mass dimuons. 4 The study of quarkonia production in p-p collisions allows one to investigate perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of QCD, by means of the analysis of the kinematic distributions of the resonances; 5 quarkonia production in nuclear collisions, on the other hand, is of primary importance to test quarkonia suppression/recombination mechanisms possibly being effective in deconfined QCD matter and already intensively investigated at the SPS and RHIC heavy-ion facilities. Open charm and beauty production, besides giving information on the initial stage of the nuclear collisions thanks to the short formation time of the heavy quarks, also provides sensitivity to the energy density of the deconfined matter through the mechanism of in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks. Low mass dimuons, finally, provide insight to soft QCD processes in the LHC energy regime, and allow one to characterize the properties of the deconfined medium through the analysis of the properties and the production cross sections of the light vector mesons.",

In addition, we have only very limited possibilities to reject muons coming from semimuonic decays of pions and kaons, representing an important background both in single muon and dimuons analyses, in particular at low masses and low p T . Finally, the degradation of the kinematics, imposed by the presence of the hadron absorber, plays a crucial role in determining the mass resolution for the resonances, especially at low masses.",

The MFT is a silicon pixel detector added in the Muon Spectrometer acceptance (2.5 < \u03b7 < 4) upstream of the hadron absorber. The basic idea, motivating the integration of the MFT in the ALICE setup, is the possibility to match the extrapolated muon tracks, coming from the tracking chambers after the absorber, with the clusters measured in the MFT planes before the absorber; the match between the muon tracks and the MFT clusters being correct, muon tracks should gain enough pointing accuracy to permit a reliable measurement of their offset with respect to the primary vertex of the interaction. The measurement of the muons' offset should then allow one to: (i) disentangle prompt (quarkonia, thermal photons) from displaced (open HF) dimuons; (ii) distinguish open charm and open beauty dimuons on the basis of the analysis of the pairs' offset; (iii) study HF via single muons down to p T \u2248 1 GeV/c with limited model dependence; (iv) study beauty production down to zero p T via J/\u03c8 from b, a unique feature at the LHC in A-A collisions. In addition, applying quality cuts on the matching between the extrapolated tracks and the MFT clusters, it should be possible to reject a large fraction of background coming from semimuonic decays of primary and secondary pions and kaons, as well as punch-through hadrons arriving at the tracking chambers without being stopped in the absorber.",

Each plane is composed of a 0.2 % x/X 0 disk-shaped support element, and a 50 \u00b5m-thick assembly of silicon sensors and readout elements arranged in the front and back part of the support. Each plane thus contribute with 0.3 % x/X 0 , leading to a total of 1.5 % x/X 0 for the whole MFT. The material budget traversed by the muons before arriving the MFT depends on the geometry of the beryllium beam pipe. In the simulations presented here we considered a cylindrical beam pipe having an internal radius of 2 cm and a thickness of 500 \u00b5m, a realistic scenario for the 2017 upgrade. It should be noted here that a cylindrical beam pipe induces at high rapidity multiple scattering effects not at all negligible; for this reason, present studies are on-going on possible setups with a modified conical beam-pipe. Conclusions on such investigations will be available in the next future, and within this report no comparison will be established between concurrent geometry setups of the beam pipe.",

To investigate the MFT performances in terms of the offset resolution for the single muons, single muons were generated at a fixed position in (0, 0, 0). The offset of the reconstructed muon tracks was then evaluated assuming the production vertex to be measured by the ALICE Internal Tracking System (ITS) with a precision of 100 \u00b5m along the z direction. The observed offset resolution has been studied as a function of the muon momentum, see Fig. 1. The resolution is as good as \u223c 100 \u00b5m even for muon momenta down to \u223c 7 GeV/c. Slight differences between x and y directions probably reflect a remnant of the x \u2212 y asymmetry introduced by the dipole magnetic field after the absorber. Studies are ongoing to characterize the offset resolution as a function of the muon rapidity, too, from which significant differences between a cylindrical and a conical beam pipe geometry could emerge. The improved pointing accuracy gained by means of the matching between the extrapolated muon tracks and the MFT clusters, allows one to have a better evaluation of the opening angle for prompt muon pairs. This results in better mass resolutions for all the resonance measured in the dimuon channel, in particular for the lightest ones (\u03b7, \u03c9 and \u03c6) whose soft muons suffer more from the degradation of the kinematics induced by the hadron absorber. A comparison between the currently available resolution and the one resulting from the preliminary MFT simulations is shown in Fig. 2, for the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons. With a simple Gaussian fit on the peaks obtained with the MFT simulations, one finds \u03c3 \u03c9 \u2248 16 MeV/c 2 and \u03c3 \u03c6 \u2248 20 MeV/c 2 , an improvement up to a factor \u223c 3 with respect to the resolutions available with the current Muon Arm setup.
