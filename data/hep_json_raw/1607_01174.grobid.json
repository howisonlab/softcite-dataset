With an additional 404 days of data collected in eight antineutrino detectors, this search benefits from 3.6 times the statistics available to the previous publication, as well as from improvements in energy calibration and background reduction. A relative comparison of the rate and energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos in the three experimental halls yields no evidence of sterile neutrino mixing in the 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV 2 |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.3 eV 2 mass range. The resulting limits on sin 2 2\u03b814 are improved by approximately a factor of two over previous results and constitute the most stringent constraints to date in the |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.2 eV 2 region.",

Despite this success, the exact mechanism by which neutrinos acquire their mass remains unknown, and the possible existence of additional neutrinos is under active consideration. To be consistent with precision electroweak measurements [5], these additional neutrinos are called \"sterile\" [2], that is, non-interacting within the Standard Model and thus with no known mechanism for direct detection. Nonetheless, an unambiguous signal of their existence can be sought in neutrino oscillation experiments, where they could affect the way in which the three active neutrinos oscillate if they mix with the latter.",

A few anomalies in short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] can be explained with additional sterile neutrinos, but these results are in tension with the limits obtained from other experiments [14][15][16][17]. The majority of experimental searches have centered on mass-squared differences around 1 eV 2 and higher, whereas Daya Bay and other medium baseline reactor antineutrino experiments can make unique contributions in the sub-eV scale [6,[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. In 2014, Daya Bay reported on a search for light sterile neutrino mixing based on the first 217 days of data acquired with a partial configuration of six functionally identical antineutrino detectors (ADs) deployed at three experimental halls (EHs), the results of which excluded a large, previously unexplored region of parameter space in the 3\u00d710 \u22124 eV 2 |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.1 eV 2 range [26]. In this partial configuration, three ADs were installed in two near halls (two in EH1 and one in EH2) and another three in a far hall (EH3). This Letter reports on an improved search made with the full eight-detector configuration shown in Fig. 1 that resulted from the installation of two additional ADs, one in EH2 and another in EH3, in the summer of 2012. The additional 404 days of eight-detector data collected from October 2012 to November 2013 amount to a 3.6 times increase in statistics. Each AD is a three-zone cylindrical detector comprised of two nested acrylic vessels within a concentric stainless steel vessel. The central vessel is filled with 20 tons of gadoliniumdoped liquid scintillator (Gd-LS) that serves as the primary target for antineutrino detection. A 22-ton pure LS volume encloses the central target and enables detection of \u03b3-rays that escape from the Gd-LS volume. The outermost cylinder contains 40 tons of mineral oil that provide shielding against \u03b3ray radiation from the detector components. A total of 192 photomultiplier tubes are installed on the vertical surfaces, and the top and bottom surfaces are covered with optical reflectors. Three automated calibration units (ACUs) [27] that store and deploy calibration sources and LEDs sit on top of the stainless steel vessel. The ADs are housed inside a muon veto system consisting of two optically-separated inner and outer water pools [28] that provide shielding from ambient radiation and serve as active water Cherenkov muon detectors. Four layers of resistive plate chambers are installed on top of each water pool. More information on the Daya Bay detectors and their performance can be found in Refs. [29,30].",

In the 8-AD period the backgrounds amount to only 2% of the total candidate samples in the near and far halls [31]. Two out of three Am-C calibration sources in the ACUs on the top of each far AD were removed during the installation of the two additional ADs in the summer of 2012, which reduced the far hall's Am-C background by a factor of four compared to that in the previous publication. This dataset also incorporates a reduction in the AD-uncorrelated energy scale uncertainty from 0.35% to 0.2% due to the implementation of better vertex-and timedependent corrections [31]. This is one of the dominant systematic uncertainties, and is quantified by studying the differences in detector response using various calibration and natural radioactive sources. The search for sterile neutrino mixing at Daya Bay is carried out through a relative comparison of the antineutrino rates and energy spectra at the three experimental halls. The unique configuration of multiple baselines to three pairs of nuclear reactors allows exploration of \u2206m 2 41 spanning more than three orders of magnitude. Fig. 2 shows the ratios of the observed prompt energy spectra at EH2 and EH3 to the best fit prediction from EH1 in the three-neutrino case. In this figure, the data are compared with the four-neutrino mixing scenario as-  [32]. The normal mass ordering is assumed for both \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 41 , although this choice has only a marginal impact on the results.",

A \u03c7 2 constructed with an alternative combination of the near and far detectors, such as EH2-EH1 and EH3-EH1, yields an equivalent sensitivity. All the sources of systematic error included in the most recent oscillation analysis of Ref. [31] are considered, in addition to the uncertainty in the estimation of \u2206m 2 32 . Method B simultaneously fits the spectra from all ADs using the predicted reactor antineutrino flux. A binned loglikelihood function is constructed with nuisance parameters for the various systematic terms, including the detector response and the backgrounds. The reactor antineutrino flux is constrained based on the Huber [33] and Mueller [34] fissile antineutrino models. The spectral uncertainties in the models are enlarged as motivated by the observed discrepancy between the predicted reactor antineutrino spectrum and the data [35][36][37][38], as well as by the recent re-examination of the systematic uncertainties in Ref. [39]. Specifically, the uncorrelated spectral uncertainties for 235 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu are conservatively increased to above 4%, while that of 238 U is kept above 10%. The uncertainty of the predicted reactor \u03bd e rate is also increased to 5%.",

The different treatments of systematic uncertainties provide a thorough cross-check of the results. For method A, the minimum \u03c7 2 value obtained with a free-floating \u2206m 2 41 , sin 2 2\u03b8 14 and sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is \u03c7 2 4\u03bd /NDF = 129.1/145, where NDF stands for the number of degrees of freedom.

The value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is independently set for each hypothesis based on a fit to the data. The condition of CL s \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is required to set the \u03b1 CL s exclusion region. When used with the same analysis method (A or B), the difference in sensitivity between the Feldman-Cousins and CL s approaches is found to be smaller than 10%. The Feldman-Cousins approach provides a unified method to define confidence intervals, but has the drawback that it involves fitting a large amount of simulated datasets. Hence, it is used only for method A, which eliminates all of the nuisance parameters by utilizing a covariance matrix. In contrast, the CL s implementation is significantly less computationally intensive, and also provides an alternative for combining the results between multiple experiments [41,42]. Accordingly, both the Feldman-Cousins limit from method A and the CL s limit from method B are presented in this work.  Fig. 3 shows the 95% confidence level contour from the Feldman-Cousins approach and the 95% CL s exclusion con-tour. Both contours are centered around the 95% C.L. expectation and are mostly contained within the \u00b11\u03c3 band constructed from simulated datasets with statistical and systematic fluctuations. The high-precision data at multiple baselines allows exclusion of a large section of (sin 2 2\u03b8 14 , |\u2206m 2 41 |) parameter space. The sensitivity in the 0.01 eV 2 |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.3 eV 2 region originates predominantly from the relative spectral comparison between the two near halls, and in the |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.01 eV 2 region from the comparison between the near and far halls. The dip structure at |\u2206m 2 41 | \u2248 |\u2206m 2 32 | \u2248 2.4\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 is due to the degeneracy between sin 2 2\u03b8 14 and sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . The fine structure of the data contours compared to the expectation originates from statistical fluctuations in the data.",

The increased statistics are the largest contributor to this improvement, although the reductions in background and in the ADuncorrelated energy scale uncertainty also play a role. The uncertainty in |\u2206m 2 32 | is the dominant systematic uncertainty in the |\u2206m 2 41 | |\u2206m 2 32 | region, while for higher values of |\u2206m 2 41 | the AD-uncorrelated energy scale and detector efficiency uncertainties are dominant. The total uncertainty is dominated by the statistics; another factor of two improvement in sensitivity is expected by 2017. This result can be combined with (\u2212) \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance searches [44]  In summary, we report an improved search for light sterile neutrino mixing with the full configuration of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in the electron antineutrino disappearance channel. No evidence of a light sterile neutrino is found through a relative comparison of the observed antineutrino energy spectra at the three experimental halls. With 3.6 times the statistics of the previous publication, these results set the most stringent limits to date on sin 2 2\u03b8 14 in the 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV 2 |\u2206m 2 41 | 0.2 eV 2 region.
