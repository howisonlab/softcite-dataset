The single-differential cross-sections d\u03c3/dQ 2 , d\u03c3/dx and d\u03c3/dy and the reduced cross-section\u03c3 were measured in the kinematic region Q 2 > 185 GeV 2 and y < 0.9, where Q 2 is the four-momentum transfer squared, x the Bjorken scaling variable, and y the inelasticity of the interaction. The measurements were performed separately for positively and negatively polarised positron beams. The measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 135.5 pb \u22121 collected with the ZEUS detector in 2006 and 2007 at a centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV. The structure functionsF 3 and F \u03b3Z 3 were determined by combining the e + p results presented in this paper with previously published e \u2212 p neutral current results. The asymmetry parameter A + is used to demonstrate the parity violation predicted in electroweak interactions. The measurements are well described by the predictions of the Standard Model.",

The higher Q 2 reach of HERA has also allowed the exploration of the electroweak sector of the SM.",

The figures demonstrate the precision of this measurement. The measured cross sections are well described by the SM prediction evaluated using the HERAPDF1.5 PDFs. 6 The reduced cross sections of unpolarised e + p NC DIS, tabulated in Table 4, are shown in Fig. 5. The residual polarisation was corrected for using theoretical predictions. The SM predictions are in good agreement with the measurements over the full kinematic range. Also shown are the unpolarised e \u2212 p NC DIS cross sections, measured using an integrated luminosity of 169.9 pb \u22121 collected between 2005 and 2006 [5]. In Section 2, it was discussed that the e \u2212 p and e + p reduced cross sections only differ at high Q 2 . As the contribution of xF 3 has to be extracted through a subtraction (see Eq. (4)), a very precise measurement of these cross sections is needed. Figure 6 shows the result on xF 3 obtained according to Eq. (4) from the unpolarised e + p and e \u2212 p reduced cross sections in the high-Q 2 region. The systematic uncertainties were treated as uncorrelated between the e + p and the e \u2212 p measurements in the extraction of xF 3 . The measurements are well described by the SM predictions.

The data are also well described by the SM predictions using the HERAPDF1.5 PDFs. At high Q 2 , a difference between the positively and negatively polarised cross sections is predicted. To demonstrate this effect, the single-differential cross-section d\u03c3/dQ 2 was measured separately for positive and negative beam polarisations. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Both measurements are well described by the SM predictions using different sets of PDFs taking the uncertainty due to the luminosity measurement into account.

The ratio of the measured single-differential cross-section d\u03c3/dQ 2 for the two different polarisation states is shown in Fig. 10 (a). The difference between the two polarisation states is clearly visible at higher Q 2 . The asymmetry A + (see Eq. (13)) extracted from these measurements is tabulated in Table 15 and is shown in Fig. 10 (b), where only statistical uncertainties are considered. The uncertainty in A + arising from the relative normalization between the data sets was evaluated to be 1 %. The other systematic uncertainties are assumed to cancel. The SM also describes these results well. The deviation of A + from zero, particularly at high Q 2 , shows the difference in the behaviour of the two polarisation states and is clear evidence of parity violation. The precision of the data makes the effect also clearly visible at relatively low Q 2 , where it is intrinsically small.",
