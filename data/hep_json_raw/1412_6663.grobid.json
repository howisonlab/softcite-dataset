Charged Higgs bosons are searched for in events consistent with top-quark pair production or in associated production with a top quark, depending on the considered H \u00b1 mass. The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic \u03c4 decay, missing transverse momentum, b-tagged jets, a hadronically decaying W boson, and the absence of any isolated electrons or muons with high transverse momenta. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the product of branching ratios B(t \u2192 bH \u00b1 ) \u00d7 B(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd), between 0.23% and 1.3% for charged Higgs boson masses in the range 80-160 GeV. It also leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio, \u03c3(pp \u2192 tH \u00b1 + X) \u00d7 B(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd), between 0.76 pb and 4.5 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 180 GeV to 1000 GeV. In the context of different scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, these results exclude nearly all values of tan \u03b2 above one for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 GeV and 160 GeV, and exclude a region of parameter space with high tan \u03b2 for H \u00b1 masses between 200 GeV and 250 GeV.",

            "text": "Charged Higgs bosons (H + , H \u2212 ) are predicted by several non-minimal Higgs scenarios, such as two-Higgs-doublet Models (2HDM) [1] or models containing Higgs triplets [2][3][4][5][6]. As the Standard Model (SM) does not contain any elementary charged scalar particle, the observation of a charged Higgs boson 1 would clearly indicate new phenomena beyond the SM. For instance, supersymmetric models predict the existence of charged Higgs bosons. In a type-II 2HDM, such as the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [7][8][9][10][11], the main H + production mode at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would JHEP03(2015)088 be through top-quark decays t \u2192 bH + , for charged Higgs boson masses (m H + ) smaller than the top-quark mass (m top ). At the LHC, top quarks are produced predominantly through tt production. In this paper, the contribution to t \u2192 bH + which may arise from single top-quark production is neglected, since the signal production cross section through this channel is very small with respect to tt production. A diagram illustrating the leadingorder production mechanism is shown on the left-hand side of figure 1. For charged Higgs boson masses larger than m top , the main H + source at the LHC is through associated production with a top quark. An additional b-quark can also appear in the final state. The leading-order production mechanisms in two different approximations are illustrated in the centre and right-hand side diagrams of figure 1: in the four-flavour scheme (4FS) b-quarks are dynamically produced, whereas in the five-flavour scheme (5FS) the b-quark is also considered as an active flavour inside the proton. Their cross sections are matched according to ref. [12], and an evaluation of the two schemes can be found in ref. [13].",

            "text": "In the MSSM, the Higgs sector can be completely determined at tree level by one of the Higgs boson masses, here taken to be m H + , and tan \u03b2, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. For m H + < m top , the decay via H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd is dominant for tan \u03b2 > 2 and remains sizeable for 1 < tan \u03b2 < 2. For higher m H + , the decay via H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd is still significant, especially for large values of tan \u03b2 [14]. The combined LEP lower limit for the charged Higgs boson mass is about 90 GeV [15]. The Tevatron experiments placed upper limits on B(t \u2192 bH + ) in the 15-20% range for m H + < m top [16,17]. In a previous search based on data taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS and CMS detectors, the limits on B(t \u2192 bH + ) were lowered to the range 0.8-4% [18,19]. For all of these results, B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) = 100% was assumed. This paper describes a search for charged Higgs bosons with masses in the ranges 80-160 GeV and 180-1000 GeV. The region 160 GeV < m H + < 180 GeV is not considered in this paper, since there is currently no reliable theoretical treatment for the interference between the different H + production modes in this transition region [20]. The final state studied is characterised by the presence of a hadronic \u03c4 decay (\u03c4 had ), missing transverse momentum (E miss T ), b-quark-initiated jets, a hadronically decaying W boson, and the absence of any isolated electrons or muons with high transverse momenta. In addition to the large branching ratio for a \u03c4 to decay hadronically, this final state contains only neutrinos associated with the H + production and decay, resulting in good discriminating power between SM and signal processes. Charged Higgs bosons are searched for in a modelindependent way, hence results are given in terms of B(t \u2192 bH + ) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) (lowmass search, m H + < m top ) and \u03c3(pp \u2192tH + + X) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) (high-mass search, m H + > m top ). These limits are then also interpreted in different MSSM scenarios. The results are based on 19.5 fb \u22121 of data from pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The final state analysed for the low-mass search is tt \u2192 bbW \u2212 H + \u2192 bb(qq \u2032 )(\u03c4 + had \u03bd). The final state is similar or identical for the high-mass search, depending on whether the additional b-quark-initiated jet is seen in the detector, gb \u2192tH + \u2192 (W \u2212b )H + \u2192 (qq \u2032b )(\u03c4 + had \u03bd) in the 5FS case and gg \u2192tbH + \u2192 (W \u2212b )bH + \u2192 (qq \u2032b )b(\u03c4 + had \u03bd) in the 4FS case.",

Inclusive cross sections are taken from the approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) predictions for tt production [30], for single top-quark production in the t-channel and s-channel [31,32], as well as for W t production [33]. Overlaps between SM W t and tt final states are removed [24]. Single vector boson (W and Z/\u03b3 * ) production is simulated with up to five accompanying partons, using ALPGEN [34] interfaced to HERWIG and JIMMY, and using the CTEQ6L1 [35] parton distribution functions. The additional partons produced in the matrix-element part of the event generation can be light partons or heavy quarks. In the latter case, ALPGEN is also used to generate dedicated samples with matrix elements for the production of massive bb or cc pairs. Diboson events (W W , W Z and ZZ) are generated using HERWIG. The cross sections are normalised to NNLO predictions for W -boson and Z/\u03b3 * production [36,37] and to next-to-leading-order (NLO) predictions for diboson production [38]. The SM background samples are summarised in table 1.",

The process tt \u2192 bbH + H \u2212 gives a very small contribution to the signal region, which is negligible after the event selection described in section 4.1. The cross section for these processes depends only on the total tt production cross section and the branching ratio B(t \u2192 bH + ). For 180 GeV \u2264 m H + \u2264 1000 GeV, the simulation of the signal for top-quark associated H + production is performed with POWHEG [39] interfaced to PYTHIA 8 [40]. For 180 GeV \u2264 m H + \u2264 200 GeV, samples are produced in m H + steps of 10 GeV, then in intervals of 25 GeV up to m H + = 300 GeV and in intervals of 50 GeV for m H + \u2264 600 GeV. Additionally, signal mass points at m H + = 750 GeV and m H + = 1000 GeV are produced. The production cross section for the high-mass charged Higgs boson is computed using the 4FS and 5FS, including theoretical uncertainties, and combined according to ref. [12]. The samples are generated at NLO using the 5FS and the narrow-width approximation for the H + . Possible effects from the interference between",

The output of boosted decision tree algorithms [55,56] is used to distinguish \u03c4 had-vis from jets not initiated by \u03c4 leptons, separately for \u03c4 had decays with one or three charged-particle tracks. In this analysis, a point with 40% (35%) efficiency for identification of 1(3)-prong \u03c4 had-vis is used, and this requirement is referred to as the \u03c4 had-vis identification. Dedicated algorithms are used to reject electrons and muons that are incorrectly identified as \u03c4 had-vis [54]. After these algorithms are applied, the backgrounds arising from muons and electrons misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis are very small, although there is still a sizeable background from jets misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis .",

In the m max JHEP03(2015)088   Observed and expected 95% CL exclusion limits on the production and decay of (a) low-mass and (b) high-mass charged Higgs bosons. For the low-mass search, the limit is computed for B(t \u2192 bH + ) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) for charged Higgs boson production from topquark decays as a function of m H + . For the high-mass search, the limit is computed for \u03c3(pp \u2192tH + + X) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), and is to be understood as applying to the total production cross section times branching ratio of H + and H \u2212 combined. The exclusions in several additional scenarios, not shown here, were also considered. In the light top squark, light stau and tauphobic scenarios, no significant exclusion is achieved in the high-mass search. In the low-mass search, the excluded regions in these scenarios are similar to those shown in figure 8. The limits for the low-mass H + search are also interpreted in the low-M H scenario, where m H + \u2248 130 GeV. Instead of excluding areas in the m H +tan \u03b2 plane, limits are interpreted in the tan \u03b2-\u00b5 plane, for 300 GeV < \u00b5 < 3500 GeV and 1.5 < tan \u03b2 < 9.5, where \u00b5 is the higgsino mass parameter. This model is excluded everywhere where it is tested and where it is well-defined. For the interpretation of the low-mass search, the following relative theoretical uncertainties on B(t \u2192 bH + ) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) are considered [78][79][80]: 5% for one-loop electroweak corrections missing from the calculations, 2% for missing two-loop QCD corrections and about 1% (depending on tan \u03b2) for \u2206 binduced uncertainties, where \u2206 b is a correction factor to the running b-quark mass [81]. These uncertainties are added linearly, as recommended by the LHC Higgs cross section working group [79]. For the interpretation of the high-mass search, separate uncertainties are included for the 4FS and 5FS calculations [82]. For the 5FS calculation, the following theoretical uncertainties are taken into account: scale uncertainties of approximately 10-20% that vary with m H + , the combined uncertainty on the parton distribution function, mass of the b-quark, and strong coupling of approximately 10-15%. For the 4FS calculation, only a scale uncertainty of approximately 30% is taken into account. Owing to the complication arising from the overlap and interference with off-shell tt production in the mass range of m H + = 180-200 GeV, the MSSM interpretation is shown only for m H + \u2265 200 GeV.   Charged Higgs bosons decaying via H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd are searched for in tt events, in the decay mode t \u2192 bH + (low-mass search), and for H + production in association with a top quark, pp \u2192 tH + + X (high-mass search). The analysis makes use of a total of 19.5 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The final state considered in this search is characterised by the presence of a hadronic \u03c4 decay, missing transverse momentum, b-tagged jets, a hadronically decaying W boson, as well as the absence of any electrons or muons. Data-driven methods are employed to estimate the dominant background contributions. The data are found to be in agreement with the SM predictions. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the branching ratio B(t \u2192 bH + ) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) between 0.23% and 1.3% for a mass range of m H + = 80-160 GeV, a major improvement over the previous published limits of 0.8-3.4% for the mass range of m H + = 90-160 GeV [18,19]. For the mass range of m H + = 180-1000 GeV, the first upper limits from ATLAS are set for the production cross section times branching ratio, \u03c3(pp \u2192 tH + + X) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), between 0.76 pb and 4.
