The measurement of the Higgs boson lifetime is derived from its flight distance in the CMS detector with an upper bound of \u03c4 H < 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u221213 s at the 95% confidence level (C.L.), corresponding to a lower bound on the width of \u0393 H > 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22129 MeV. The measurement of the width is obtained from an off-shell production technique, generalized to include anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to two electroweak bosons. From this measurement, a joint constraint is set on the Higgs boson width and a parameter f \u039bQ that expresses an anomalous coupling contribution as an on-shell cross-section fraction. The limit on the Higgs boson width is \u0393 H < 46 MeV with f \u039bQ unconstrained and \u0393 H < 26 MeV for f \u039bQ \u00bc 0 at the 95% C.L. The constraint f \u039bQ < 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at the 95% C.L. is obtained for the expected standard model Higgs boson width.",

The two experiments have also set constraints on the spin-parity properties and anomalous couplings of the H boson [14][15][16][17][18], finding its quantum numbers to be consistent with J PC \u00bc 0 \u00fe\u00fe but allowing small anomalous coupling contributions.

The event reconstruction and analysis techniques rely on the previously published results [10,16,17,20], and their implementations are discussed in detail. Only the final state with four charged leptons is considered in this paper, but the constraints on the width could be improved by including final states with neutrinos in the off-shell production [10,11]. Indirect constraints on the H boson width and lifetime are also possible through the combination of data on H boson production and decay rates [12,21]. While such a combination tests the compatibility of the data with the SM H boson, it relies on stronger theoretical assumptions such as SM-like coupling ratios among the different final states.",

The ttH process is driven by the H boson couplings to heavy quarks like the gluon fusion process, and the VH process by the H boson couplings to weak vector bosons like the VBF process. They are therefore parametrized with the same on-shell signal strengths \u03bc ggH and \u03bc VVH , respectively. The effects of signal-background interference are not shown in Eq. (3) for illustration but are taken into account in the analysis. The relationship in Eq. (3) implies variations of the vvH couplings as a function of m 4l . This variation is assumed to be as in the SM in the gluon fusion process. The assumption is valid as long as the production is dominated by the topquark loop and no new particles contribute to this loop. Variation of the HVV couplings, either in the VBF or VH production or in the H \u2192 ZZ decay, may depend on anomalous coupling contributions. An enhancement of the off-shell signal production is suggested with anomalous HVV couplings [10,[25][26][27], but neither experimental studies of off-shell production nor realistic treatment of signal-background interference has been done with these anomalous couplings. We extend the methodology of the recent analysis of anomalous HVV couplings of the H boson [17] to study these couplings and introduce in the scattering amplitude an additional term that depends on the H boson invariant mass, \u00f0q V1 \u00fe q V2 \u00de 2 :",

The ratio of any loop contribution from a heavy particle in the HVV scattering amplitude to the SM tree-level a 1 term would be predominantly real, and the imaginary part of the ratio would be small. If the contribution instead comes from an additional term to the SM Lagrangian itself, this ratio can only be real.

On-shell and off-shell events from gluon fusion production are generated with the MCFM 6.7 [24,41,42] and GG2VV 3.1.5 [43] MC generators while those for the VBF and associated production with an electroweak boson V are generated with PHANTOM 1.2.3 [44]. The leptonic decay of the associated V boson is modeled with a reweighting procedure based on the branching ratios of the V boson [45], and the relatively small contribution of HH production is removed from the PHANTOM simulation. Pure signal, pure background, and several mixed samples with signal-background interference have been produced for the analysis of the interference effects. The modeling of the anomalous couplings from Eq. (4) in the off-shell H boson production is performed by reweighting the SM-like samples. An extended MCFM library provided as part of the Matrix Element Likelihood Approach (MELA) package, [35][36][37], allows for both reweighting and event simulation with anomalous couplings in off-shell H production, and the analytical reweighting for the f \u039bQ parametrization used in this analysis is identical to reweighting via the MELA package. Figure 1 illustrates the simulation of the gg \u2192 4l process with the above technique, which includes H boson off-shell production, its background, and their interference for the five signal models with the a 1 (SM), a 2 , a 3 , \u039b 1 , and \u039b Q terms in Eq. (4). In all cases, the on-shell yield and the width \u0393 H are constrained to the SM expectations, and large enhancements are seen in the off-shell region. The four BSM models correspond to the effective fractions f ai \u00bc 1 defined in Ref. [17] or Eq. (5). When the on-shell contributions of the anomalous couplings are small, cancellation effects in the off-shell region due to their interference with the a 1 term or with the background, as in the case of the \u039b Q term, may suppress the off-shell yield for a given \u0393 H . Among these four BSM models, the \u039b Q term results in the largest off-shell enhancement, and only the \u039b Q and a 1 terms, and their interference between each other and the background, are considered in the width analysis. Constraints on the a 2 , a 3 , and \u039b 1 terms have already been measured from on-shell analyses [17,18].",

Higher-order QCD corrections for the gluon fusion signal process are known to an accuracy of next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarithms for the total cross section [30,31], and to NNLO as a function of m 4l [46]. The m 4l -dependent correction factors to the LO cross section (K factors) are typically in the range of 2.0 to 2.7. Although no exact calculation exists beyond the LO for the gg \u2192 ZZ continuum background, it has been recently shown [47] that the soft collinear approximation is able to describe the background cross section and the interference term at NNLO. Further calculations also show that the K factors are very similar at NLO for the signal and background [48] and at NNLO for the signal and interference terms [49]. Therefore, the same K factor is used for the signal and background [46]. Similarly, QCD and electroweak corrections are known to an accuracy of NNLO for the VBF and VH signal contributions [30,31,50], but no calculation exists beyond the LO for the corresponding background contributions. The same K factors as in signal are also assumed for the background and interference contributions. Uncertainties due to the limited theoretical knowledge of the background K factor have a small impact on the final results.",

A muon candidate is identified as a charged-particle track in the muon system that matches a track reconstructed in the tracker. The electron energy is measured primarily from the ECAL cluster energy, while the muon momentum and the charged-lepton impact parameters near the interaction region are measured primarily by the tracker. Electrons and muons are required to be isolated from other charged and neutral particles [16]. Electrons (muons) are reconstructed for p T > 7\u00f05\u00de GeV within the geometrical acceptance j\u03b7j < 2.5\u00f02.4\u00de [55,56].

In the width analysis, this comparison is done with respect to the primary vertex of each event, defined as the one passing the standard vertex requirements [59] and having the largest P p 2 T of all associated charged tracks. The significance of the three-dimensional impact parameter (SIP) of each lepton, calculated from the track parameters and their uncertainties at the point of closest approach to this primary vertex, is required to be less than 4 [16]. This requirement does not allow for a displaced vertex, so in order to constrain the lifetime of the H boson, the reference of the comparison is switched to the vertex formed by the two leptons from the Z 1 candidate. The SIP of the two leptons from Z 1 is required to be less than 4, and that of the remaining two leptons is required to be less than 5. An additional requirement \u03c7 2 4l =dof < 6 for the four-lepton vertex is applied to further suppress the Z \u00fe X background. Both analyses also require the presence of the reconstructed proton-proton collision vertex in each event. The combination of these requirements allows for the detection of a displaced H boson decay while keeping the selection efficiencies similar between the two criteria.",

Jet energy corrections are applied as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7 [67]. An offset correction based on the jet area method is applied to subtract the energy contribution not associated with the high-p T scattering such as electronic noise and pileup, the latter of which results primarily from other pp collisions in the same bunch crossing [67][68][69].

The discrimination is based on the differences in the jet shapes, the relative multiplicity of charged and neutral components, and the fraction of p T carried by the hardest components [70]. In the width analysis, the events are split into two categories: those with two or more selected jets (dijet category) and the remaining events (nondijet category).

With proper matching of the hadronization scale for the LO generators in PYTHIA [71], a good agreement within 15% is found between all generators, with absolute dijet categorization efficiency of approximately 3%.

The m 4l distributions are illustrated in Fig. 3 for the on-shell and off-shell regions without any kinematic requirements, Fig. 2 (bottom) for the on-shell region with the requirement D kin bkg > 0.5, and Fig. 4 for the two event categories in the off-shell region, with the requirement D gg > 2=3 on the nondijet category. The requirements on the kinematic discriminants D kin bkg or D gg suppress the relative contribution of background in the illustration of event distributions. In the lifetime analysis, the m 4l and D kin bkg observables are combined into one, called D bkg [14,17,37], in order to reduce the number of observables. It is constructed by multiplying the matrix element probability ratio in Eq. 7by the ratio of probabilities for m 4l from the nonresonant qq \u2192 4l process and the resonant production gg \u2192 H \u2192 4l for the measured m H \u00bc 125.6 GeV. The D bkg distribution in the lifetime analysis is shown in Fig. 5. To account for the lepton momentum scale and resolution uncertainty in the m 4l or D bkg distributions, alternative signal distributions are taken from the variations of both of these contributions.",

Symmetric broadening of the \u0394t distribution indicates resolution effects while positive skew indicates sizable signal lifetime. Figure 5 displays the \u0394t distributions. The resolution in \u0394t also depends on the p T spectrum of the produced H boson, which differs among the production mechanisms, and this dependence is accounted for in the fit procedure as described in detail in Sec. VI. The distributions of \u0394t and p T are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.

It has already been established [17] that the kinematics of the H \u2192 4l decay are consistent with the kinematics of the SM H boson decay and inconsistent with a wide range of exotic models. The \u0394t and D bkg distributions have little variation within the allowed range of exotic couplings in the H \u2192 4l decay. The expected \u03c4 H constraint remains stable within 10% when the simulation for those exotic models is tested instead of the simulation with SM couplings. Anomalous couplings in production are found to have a substantial effect on the p T spectrum, typically making the spectrum harder in the VBF, WH, ZH, and ttH production mechanisms. Extreme variations in the p T spectrum, however, are already excluded by the data, and p T variations allowed by the data are reflected in the \u0394t parametrization with the parameter describing the production mechanisms.

The measurement of the width is obtained from an off-shell production technique, generalized to include additional anomalous couplings of the H boson to two electroweak bosons. This measurement provides a joint constraint on the H boson width and a parameter that quantifies an anomalous coupling contribution through an on-shell cross-section fraction f \u039bQ . The observed limit on the H boson width is \u0393 H < 46 MeV at the 95% C.L. with f \u039bQ left unconstrained while it is \u0393 H < 26 MeV at the 95% C.L. for f \u039bQ \u00bc 0.
