            "text": "The BABAR experiment at SLAC has a programme of systematic measurement of the production of the lowest-rest-mass hadronic final states, those that contribute most significantly to the integral. To that purpose, we use a method in which, while the PEP-II storage ring is operated at a constant energy in the center of mass system, \u221a s, of about 10.6 GeV, events are reconstructed and selected which have been produced with a hadronic final state together with a high-energy photon which may (photon tagging) or may not (no tagging) be observed. In our kinematic configuration the photon is almost always emitted by the electron or by the positron of the initial state, hence the name \"initial-state radiation\" (ISR). The cross section for the direct e + e \u2212 \u2192 f production of a final state f at an energy \u221a s is then extracted from the differential cross section of the ISR production of the state f with invariant mass \u221a s . The programme is almost completed and has lead to a number of first measurements and to an improvement of up to a factor of three of the uncertainties on the contributions of individual channels to a \u00b5 . The uncertainty on a VP \u00b5 is now of similar magnitude as that on a LbL \u00b5 . On the experimental side, two projects aiming at a measurement of a \u00b5 with an improved precision are in preparation at Fermilab and at J-PARC: their results are eagerly awaited !

Understanding the value of a \u00b5 necessi- we see that due to the \u00b5-to-e mass difference, the development for a e converges extremely rapidly and that the non-QED contributions are very small: a precise value of \u03b1 can be extracted from a e and then injected in the calculation of a \u00b5 . The value of a \u00b5 so obtained has a very small uncertainty and is compatible with that obtained using a value of \u03b1 from atomic physics (Table 1): the QED contribution, which has been computed up to the 5 th order in \u03b1 [3], is under excellent control.

The control of the systematics below the % level made it necessary to perform the analysis at the NLO level, that is, to take into account the possible radiation of an additional photon, be it from the initial (ISR) or from the final (FSR) state. The im-possibility to control the global differential luminosity with the desired precision, in particular the MC-based efficiency, lead us to derive the value of R from the ratio of the ISR production of the final state f to the ISR production of a pair of muons, \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Most of the systematics, including those related to the absolute luminosity, of the ISR photon reconstruction and of additional ISR radiation, cancel in the ratio.

We have validated this assumption by an experimental study of the ISR-FSR interference in \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ISR production. Because charge parities of the final state pair are opposite for ISR and FSR, the interference be- Table 3: Contributions to a VP \u00b5 for recent BABAR publications: comparison of the measured value to the previous world average on the energy range \u221a s < 1.8 GeV (units 10 \u221210 ). tween ISR and FSR changes sign with the charge interchange of the two muons (pions). As a consequence, investigation of the charge asymmetry of the process gives access to the interference between ISR and FSR, which enables the separate measurement of the magnitudes of the ISR and of the FSR amplitudes [37]. For the pion channel, results match a model where final state radiation originates predominantly from the quarks that subsequently hadronize into a pion pair, while for the muon control channel, good consistency is found with QED.
