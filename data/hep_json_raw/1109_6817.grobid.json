In contrast, 3\u03c0 0 data contain weak 0 \u2212 contributions from the final state f 2 (1270)\u03c0 with orbital angular momentum L = 2 in the decay process. There, the 0 \u2212 amplitude is hard to separate from larger L = 2 f 2 (1270)\u03c0 amplitudes with J P = 2 \u2212 and 4 \u2212 .

The latter two are stronger than is immediately apparent from the figure, since the a 0 and a 2 peaks originate from only one of the two \u03c0 0 \u03b7 combinations, e.g. from \u03c0 0 \u03b7 1 ; the other combination \u03c0 0 \u03b7 2 produces a broad background when projected on to M(\u03c0 0 \u03b7 1 ), as one sees from Dalitz plots. In Ref. [3], it was shown that a small but highly significant peak in the \u03b7\u03b7 channel requires the presence of f 0 (1770) at beam momenta 900-1350 MeV/c. In Ref. [2], it was also shown that data at 1525-1940 MeV/c require a strong f 0 (2105) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 signal. That resonance has also been observed inpp \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 [4] and was first identified in J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b3(4\u03c0) data [5], where f 0 (2105) \u2192 \u03c3\u03c3, and \u03c3 stands for the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave amplitude. Ref. [2] also presented evidence for a broad 2 + signal in \u03b7\u03b7 with M = 1980 \u00b1 50 MeV, \u0393 = 500 \u00b1 100 MeV. There is further evidence for this broad state in WA102 data on central production of 4\u03c0 [6].",

A full fit is made to production and decay of all channels (1)- (8) in terms ofpp partial waves up to J P = 4 \u2212 . Each partial wave has a distinctive dependence via relativistic tensor expressions Z(\u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2) on production angle \u03b8 of each resonance in the centre of mass, and on its decay angles (\u03b1, \u03b2) in the rest frame of the resonance. The energy dependence of each partial wave amplitude is expressed as the sum of up to two s-channel resonances plus a background. These resonances, described by simple Breit-Wigner functions of s with constant widths, are found to cluster in the mass ranges 1930-2070 MeV and 2220-2360 MeV. The background, where required, is taken as the high energy tail of a resonance below thepp threshold. This parametrisation guarantees that partial wave amplitudes satisfy the necessary condition of analyticity, relating the energy dependence of magnitudes and phases. Blatt-Weisskopf centrifugal barrier factors B \u2113 (p) and B L (q) are included in the partial wave amplitudes; B \u2113 (p) incorporates the correct threshold dependence on momentum p in thepp channel for initial orbital angular momentum \u2113, and B L (q) likewise describes the dependence on L and momentum q in the decay to the final state, eg. a 0 (980)\u03b7. The radius of the barrier is set to 0.83 fm from the determination in Ref. [4]. The a 0 (980) amplitude for decay to particles 1 and 2 is described by a Flatt\u00e9 formula F (s 12 ) and other resonances are described by Breit-Wigner amplitudes. In summary, the full partial wave amplitude for channel (1), as an example, is given by",

The f 0 (2105) appears only in S-wave production and is very secure. The f 0 (1500)\u03c0 channel makes only a small contribution with J P = 0 \u2212 from both resonances at 2360 and 2070 MeV, shown by the full curve of Fig. 4(b). Table 2 shows that a 0 (980)\u03b7 makes decisive contributions to both resonances at 2360 and 2070 MeV. For the a 0 (980)\u03b7 channel, there is large interference between the upper and lower 0 \u2212 resonances; the combined contribution is shown by the dashed curve of Fig. 4(b). Despite this interference, contributions from a 0 (980)\u03b7 are very stable. This channel and f 0 (2105)\u03c0 agree closely on a mass M = 2355 \u00b1 25 MeV for present data. The cross section for production of f 0 (2105)\u03c0 rises at high mass faster than phase space for that channel and requires production through \u03c0(2360). Fig. 4(g) shows the variation of log likelihood as the mass is varied. All fits with a variety of ingredients give masses in the range 2337 to 2377 MeV. This range is used to assess the systematic error, which is much larger than the statistical error. The fit to 3\u03c0 0 data gives a higher but distinctly less accurate mass 2385 \u00b1 45 MeV. The weighted mean of 2360 \u00b1 25 MeV fits both \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 data and 3\u03c0 0 well. The width is much less well determined: \u0393 = 300 +100",

The \u03b7 2 (1860) has been confirmed by WA102 [10]. Two neighbouring J P = 2 \u2212 states with I = 1 and different decay modes are then a clear possibility. If the spacing in mass squared follows the empirically observed 1.143 GeV 2 , the radial excitation of \u03c0 2 (1670) is expected at 1985 \u00b1 20 MeV. Because two separate \u03c0 2 candidates in a narrow mass range require one of them to be an intruder state (probably the predicted hybrid), and because both lie at the bottom of our available mass range, we acknowledge that confirmation is desirable. We present the evidence so that other experimental groups should be alert to the possibility of two separate states. Present data are consistent with \u03c0 2 (1880) accounting for the entire a 2 (1320)\u03b7 and f 0 (1500)\u03c0 signals; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these two channels are also fed in the present data partly by the second state at 2005 MeV.",

There is a small but highly significant 3 + peak at 2260 \u00b1 50 MeV in the dashed curve in Fig. 4(e). Despite large errors for mass and width, this is additional evidence that a 3 + resonance exists in this mass range. Likewise, there is a distinct peak in the 2 \u2212 amplitude for production of a 2 (1660)\u03c0, shown by the chain curve of Fig. 4(d); unfortunately, the determination of mass and width are poor, both here and in 3\u03c0 0 data. There is a distinct 4 \u2212 signal in a 0 (980)\u03b7; Table 2 shows that it produces a large improvement in log likelihood of 213. It optimises at 2255 \u00b1 30 MeV in present data, very close to the value 2250 \u00b1 15 MeV for 3\u03c0 0 data, where there is a large 4 \u2212 signal. For J P = 1 + , shown by the full curve in Fig. 4(e), there is a definite signal at the higher masses; this is evidence in favour of the state required in the analysis of 3\u03c0 0 data at 2270 MeV. At the bottom of the mass range, a second 1 + state gives a small improvement of 37 in log likelihood. This improvement is sufficient to require some additional low mass contribution, but is not sufficient to determine the mass and width of any possible resonance. Table 2 includes small contributions from 2 + states at 1950, 2030 and 2175 MeV; those states are required by 3\u03c0 0 data, but contributions to \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 are too small to help determine masses and widths.",

We find that the broad f 2 (1980) is produced purely by this a 2 (2255) decaying to f 2 (1980)\u03c0 with L = 1. It has a ratio of coupling constants g between 3 F 2 and 3 P 2 amplitudes of r 2 = g( 3 F 2 )/g( 3 P 2 ) = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.4 for present data; this ratio agrees well with the value \u22122.13 \u00b1 0.20 determined in Ref.

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling ofpp to 3 F 2 and 3 P 2 are such that the initial state will be purely m = 0 if r 2 = \u2212 7/2 \u2243 \u22121.9. The m = 0 state decays purely to final states with m \u2032 = \u00b11, again because of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Thus, the curious property that the f 2 (1980) is produced almost purely with m \u2032 = \u00b11 seems to be a fortuitous consequence of the fact that the a 2 (2255) has r 2 close to \u22121.9.",
