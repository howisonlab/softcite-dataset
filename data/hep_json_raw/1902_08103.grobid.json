In all cases, LHC proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . Masses below 800 GeV are excluded for both LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 independently of the branching ratio, with masses below about 1 TeV being excluded for the limiting cases of branching ratios equal to zero or unity.",

Also, recent hints of a potential violation of lepton universality in measurements of B-meson decays can be attributed, if confirmed, to the exchange of LQs [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. LQs are bosons carrying colour and fractional electrical charge. They possess non-zero baryon and lepton numbers and decay into a quark-lepton pair. Leptoquarks can be scalar or vector bosons and can be produced singly or in pairs in proton-proton collisions.",

The assumption that LQs can only interact with leptons and quarks of the same family follows the minimal Buchm\u00fcller-R\u00fcckl-Wyler model [15], which is the benchmark model used in this analysis. The LQs couple to the quark-lepton pair via a Yukawa interaction. The couplings are determined by two parameters: a model parameter \u03b2 and the coupling parameter \u03bb. The coupling to the charged lepton (\u03c4 ) is given by \u221a \u03b2\u03bb, and the coupling to the \u03c4 -neutrino \u03bd by \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb. The search is carried out for an up-type (LQ u 3 \u2192 t\u03bd/b\u03c4 ) and a down-type (LQ d 3 \u2192 b\u03bd/t\u03c4 ) leptoquark.",

            "text": "-1 -JHEP06(2019)144  The LQ model is identical to the one used for a recent ATLAS search for first-and second-generation scalar LQs using the dataset from 2015 and 2016, consisting of 36.1 fb \u22121 of data taken at \u221a s = 13 TeV [16]. In the following, the third-generation results are presented for that same dataset, where all possible decays of the pair-produced LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 into a quark (t, b) and a lepton (\u03c4 , \u03bd) of the third generation are considered. The results are presented as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching ratio (B) into charged leptons, in contrast to using mass and \u03b2 as done for the first and second generations. This is due to the fact that \u03b2 is not equal to the branching ratio for third-generation LQs due to the sizeable top-quark mass. Previous ATLAS results for third-generation LQs for the case B = 0 for both LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 used the \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset from 2012 [17]. The most recent CMS results are based on the 2016 dataset targeting B = 0 for both LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 [18] as well as B = 1 for LQ u 3 [19] and LQ d 3 [20]. The results presented here are from a dedicated LQ search based on a search for pairproduced Higgs bosons decaying into two b-jets and two \u03c4 -leptons [21], where the search is optimized for the LQ u 3 pair production with B \u2248 1, and four reinterpretations of ATLAS searches for supersymmetric particles. Supersymmetric particles can have similar or even identical experimental signatures and very similar kinematics to pair-produced LQs. Pair production of the supersymmetric partner of the top (bottom) quark, known as the top (bottom) squark, has the same experimental signature of a tt-pair (bb-pair) and missing transverse momentum as LQ u 3 (LQ d 3 ) pair production with B = 0 (see figure 1). Hence, the ATLAS searches for top squarks in final states with one [22] or zero [23] leptons and for bottom squarks [24] are optimal when searching for LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 with B = 0, respectively. The final state of two \u03c4 -leptons, b-jets, and missing transverse momentum is targeted in another top-squark pair-production search [25] and is expected to be sensitive to medium and high branching ratios into charged leptons. For all analyses, the results are presented as a function of B and the leptoquark mass for both LQ u 3 and LQ d 3 . The paper is structured as follows. After a brief description of the ATLAS detector, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of LQ pair production are discussed. This is followed by JHEP06(2019)144 a description of the five analyses, starting with the dedicated search for two b-jets and two \u03c4 -leptons. Four brief sections describe the reinterpretations of searches for supersymmetric particles, as the published analyses are not modified for this reinterpretation. Each of the five analysis sections finish with cross-section and mass limits for a fixed value of B to which the analysis is particularly sensitive. Finally, the results of all analyses are presented as a function of B and leptoquark mass.",

During the LHC shutdown between Run 1 and Run 2, a new innermost layer of silicon pixels was added, which improves the track impact parameter resolution and vertex position resolution [27][28][29]. The inner detector is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, followed by a lead/liquid-argon electromagnetic sampling calorimeter and a steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter. The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with liquid-argon calorimeters for both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The outer part of the detector consists of a muon spectrometer with high-precision tracking chambers for coverage up to |\u03b7| = 2.7, fast detectors for triggering over |\u03b7| < 2.4, and three large superconducting toroidal magnets with eight coils each.

The dominant background processes are tt and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 produced in association with jets originating from heavy-flavour quarks (bb, bc, cc). The tt events are normalized using events with low BDT output score in the \u03c4 \u03c4 had category. Events from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 plus heavy-flavour jets are normalized using a control region of events that include two muons with combined invariant mass consistent with that of a Z boson. Backgrounds in which quark-or gluon-initiated jets are misidentified as hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons are estimated using data-driven methods. In both channels, tt events are estimated separately from other background sources if one or more reconstructed \u03c4 -lepton decays are mis-reconstructed jets (so-called 'fake \u03c4 -leptons').

Events containing one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum in the final state are considered. Two signal regions (SR) of the top-squark search [22], tN med and tN high, have optimal sensitivity for medium (\u223c600 GeV) and high (\u223c1 TeV) masses of the leptoquark. The tN med SR is additionally binned in E miss T , while the tN high SR is taken as a single-bin cut-and-count experiment. Both signal regions require at least four jets, at least one b-tagged jet, exactly one isolated electron or muon, and high E miss T . Variables sensitive to the direction of the E miss T are used, e.g. the transverse mass of the lepton and E miss T , denoted by m T , 2 and am T2 [43], which targets pair-produced heavy objects that each decay into a different number of measured and unmeasured particles in the detector. The hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed using jet reclustering, where several jets are combined using the anti-k t algorithm [44] with a large radius parameter that is initially set to 3.0 and then adjusted in an iterative process [22].",

The dominant background consists of tt events, which, due to the high m T requirements, are mainly from dileptonic tt decays in which one lepton is not reconstructed (tt 2L), even though this decay topology is strongly suppressed by requiring am T2 to be above the top-quark mass. Other major backgrounds are due to the production of a W boson in association with one or more jets (W +jets) and the production of a tt pair in association with a vector boson (tt + V ), where the latter is dominated by contributions from tt + Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd).

The fit determines at the same time the background normalization as well as a potential signal contribution. For each SR, a set of validation regions is defined in addition to the CRs. The validation regions are not part of the fit but are used to validate the background normalization in this second set of disjunct regions. Systematic uncertainties are included as nuisance parameters in the profile-likelihood estimate.

This leads to the background normalization factors being biased towards lower values when obtained from the exclusion fits instead of the background-only fits, and drives the nuisance parameters for the systematic uncertainties away from their nominal values. Several tests were performed to check the validity of the fit procedure used to derive the exclusion. Signalinjection tests confirmed that the fit reliably reproduces the input signal yield. In addition, it was shown that artificially reducing the input signal yield for excluded phase-space regions with a high signal contamination in the control regions, thereby reducing the signal contamination, would still allow to exclude the leptoquark signal.",

The analysis in the zerolepton channel targets LQs which both decay into a bottom quark and a neutrino, i.e. LQ d 3 production with B = 0. The one-lepton channel, also requiring two b-tagged jets and E miss T , is expected to provide sensitivity to LQ d 3 production at intermediate values of B, as well as to small and intermediate values of B for LQ u 3 production. For the zero-lepton SRs (denoted by b0L), events with two high-p T b-tagged jets, zero leptons, and a large amount of E miss T are selected. An exclusive jet selection (requiring 2-4 jets) is applied, preventing sizeable sensitivities to LQ u 3 production in this SR. Events with large E miss T arising from mismeasured jets are rejected using a selection of \u2206\u03c6 jet i , E miss T (i=1...4) > 0.4. The two b-jets are required to be the two leading jets in the event and their invariant mass must be greater than 200 GeV.

Other significant sources of background arise from tt pair production, single-top W t production, and W -boson production in association with b-jets.

A two-lepton CR is used to constrain the Z+jets process, where the invariant mass of the leptons is required to be near the Z-boson mass. The leptons are removed from the E miss T calculation to mimic the expected E miss T from the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd process.
