            "text": "It is a well established fact that matter exists in different states. One of the most important goals of heavy-ion collision (HIC) experiments is to study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by finding possible phase boundaries and establishing their properties. In particular, high energy HIC experiments want to study the deconfined matter (QGP) and the transition between QGP and confined hadrons. The NA61/SHINE experiment [1] is a fixed target experiment in the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The study of energy and system size dependence of fluctuations of identified hadrons is one of the goals of the NA61/SHINE ion program. The aim of this program is to search for the critical point (CP) [2] of strongly interacting matter as well as to uncover properties of the onset of deconfinement (OD) [3,4]. The predecessor of NA61/SHINE, the NA49 experiment [5] seems to observe fluctuations possibly related to the CP in collisions of medium size nuclei at the top energy of SPS [6]. However, measured fluctuations are affected by numerous effects not related to CP or OD like volume fluctuations and conservation laws. Thus, this result will remain inconclusive until systematic data on energy and system size dependence will be available. These data are being recorded and analysed by NA61/SHINE. The energy dependence of mean multiplicity of identified charged (left) and positively charged (right) hadrons in p+p interactions in the acceptance used for the fluctuation analysis.",

The scaled variance is an intensive measure [10], i.e. it is independent of the number of wounded nucleons in the Wounded Nucleon Model [11] or volume in the Grand Canonical Ensemble, but it depends on their fluctuations. The latter feature makes it difficult to compare results from p+p interactions with those from nucleus+nucleus collisions. For the Poisson distribution \u03c9 = 1. Figure 2 (left) shows the scaled variance of \u03c0, K and p +p. The scaled variance of all considered particle types increases with increasing energy. Rich data on the charged particle multiplicity distribution in the full phase space obey the KNO scaling [12,13]. From this scaling follows a linear increase of the scaled variance with the mean multiplicity of charged particles visible as an increase of \u03c9 \u03c0 with collision energy (see the bottom left panel of Fig. 2). The scaled variance of unidentified charged hadrons measured within the acceptance chosen for this analysis is shown in the same panel by purple diamonds. The increase with collision energy is weaker than that measured in the full phase space, but agreement between \u03c9 N ch and \u03c9 \u03c0 as well as between N and N \u03c0 indicates that KNO scaling may also apply to pion production. Figure 2 (right) shows the energy dependence of \u03c9 p , \u03c9 K + , and \u03c9 \u03c0 + . The scaled variance of identified positively charged hadrons is smaller than the one measured for the sum of charges. Moreover, in the case of positively charged hadrons, instead of an increase with the collision energy the scaled variance is approximately independent of energy. The suppressed (<1) values of \u03c9 p+p and \u03c9 p are probably due to the baryon number conservation [14]. In p+p interactions, the net baryon number is two, thus, fluctuations of the sum of charges is dominated by protons [14]. Values of \u03c9 K equal to or above 1 are Graph Figure 2.",

Full symbols refer to the NA61 respectively NA49 acceptance. Open symbols display results for the common phase-space region of NA49 and NA61. Differences between the individual and common acceptance are small. For \u03c0(p +p) there is a dip at intermediate energies. The energy dependence is similar in the case of positively charged hadrons. A similar but weaker effect is visible in Pb+Pb interactions. In the case of \u03c0K and (p +p)K there is an increase of \u03a6 ij with collision energy, which is not visible in positively charged hadrons. The increase of \u03a6 \u03c0K is not visible in Pb+Pb collision but \u03a6 \u03c0K \u2265 0 at all considered energies in both reactions. The opposite energy dependencies between p+p and Pb+Pb interactions are visible in \u03a6(p +p)K (see bottom panel ofFig. 3 (left)).",
