We construct a complete background model for this isotope, including a measurement of the twoneutrino double-\u03b2 decay half-life of T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [9.34 \u00b1 0.22 (stat.) +0.62 \u22120.60 (syst.)]\u00d710 18 y for the ground state transition, which represents the most precise result to date for this isotope. We perform a multivariate analysis to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays in order to improve the sensitivity and, in the case of observation, disentangle the possible underlying decay mechanisms. As no evidence for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is observed, we derive lower limits on half-lives for several mechanisms involving physics beyond the Standard Model. The observed lower limit, assuming light Majorana neutrino exchange mediates the decay, is T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.0 \u00d710 22 y at the 90% C.L., corresponding to an upper limit on the effective neutrino mass of m\u03bd < 1.6 -5.3 eV.",

This nuclear decay violates lepton number conservation by two units. Its observation would therefore provide direct evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The experimental signature of \u03b2\u03b2 decay involves the detection of two simultaneously emitted electrons from a common decay vertex.

Nevertheless, the rate of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is expected to be very low, and a complete understanding of all potential background rates is critical.

A group at the University of California, Irvine conducted the first measurement, using a time projection chamber (TPC) located approximately 72 m underground at the Hoover Dam [8]. With 15.5 g of Nd 2 O 3 enriched to 91% of the isotope 150 Nd and a live time of 262 d, the half-life was measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [6.75 +0.37 \u22120.42 (stat) \u00b1 0.68 (syst)] \u00d710 18 y [9]. The Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) in Moscow conducted another TPC experiment in collaboration with the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) [10,11]. Using a live time of 90 d and 51.5 g of Nd 2 O 3 , the ITEP group measured the half-life to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [18.8 +6.6 \u22123.9 (stat) \u00b1 0.19 (syst)] \u00d710 18 y. The NEMO-3 Collaboration has previously published results on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life using half of the total exposure, corresponding to 927.4 d and 36.6 g of 150 Nd. The half-life from this data set was measured to be T 2\u03bd 1/2 = [9.11 +0.25 \u22120.22 (stat) \u00b1 0.63 (syst)] \u00d710 18 y [12]. In this article, we present an updated measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life of 150 Nd using the full data set from the NEMO-3 experiment, which includes an additional 991.1 d of live time compared to Ref. [12]. We construct a full background model for this isotope and evaluate the sources of systematic uncertainties. Using this background model and a measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate, we search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays mediated by several possible BSM mechanisms.",

However, there is additional information embedded in other kinematic and topological observables from the two decay electrons, which can be used to better discriminate the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal from backgrounds and to disentangle the underlying BSM mechanisms. The design of the NEMO-3 detector allows for reconstruction of the topology and kinematics of final state particles, and thus provides a unique opportunity to study several observables and their correlations through a multivariate analysis (MVA), thereby improving the sensitivity to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays.

Energy losses in the tracker volume and the uncertainties on all quantities are taken into account in the \u03c7 2 calculation. Since \u03b3 rays do not leave hits in the tracker, their trajectories are calculated as a straight line from the geometrical center of the front face of the first calorimeter block in a cluster to the reconstructed event vertex, which is given by the electron track intersection with the foil.

Probability distributions are formed from both \u03c7 2 values, and are used as part of the event selection criteria to select internal or external-like decay topologies.

In the background model, we fix event rates from these neighboring foils to values measured in dedicated analyses [14,19,20]. Finally, the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 150 Nd also contributes to the 1e channel as shown in Fig. 4 if one of the electrons is not properly reconstructed. The electron energy distribution shown in Fig. 4 is used to estimate the activities of 40 K, 234m Pa, and 210 Bi. The 210 Bi SFoil and SWire components are highly correlated (\u221280%) due to the similarity of their energy spectra.

The conversion-electron peak from 207 Bi decays is well described by the simulation. Although this background is not critical for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search, it is an important background in the measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life. The systematic uncertainty on the normalization of 207 Bi in the twoelectron channel is estimated using data from special 207 Bi calibration sources. The activities of these sources are measured using both the 1e(N)\u03b3 and 2e(N)\u03b3 channels, where N can be any number between 0 and 10. In this way, any differences between activities measured in the two channels can be attributed to the electron reconstruction efficiency, independent of the \u03b3 reconstruction. The event selection criteria are similar to those used to select source foil events. The largest difference in activity observed between the two decay channels is 5.6%, which is assigned as the systematic uncertainty on the normalization of 207 Bi. Varying the normalization of 207 Bi by this amount has a \u00b10.24% effect on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay halflife.

The total energy (E e + \u03a3E \u03b3 ) from the 1e2\u03b3 channel, shown in Fig. 6, is also used to constrain the activity of 208 Tl. We observe good agreement between data and the simulation in both distributions, particularly in the high energy tails of Figs. 5(b) and 6 which are dominated by 208 Tl background. As equilibrium is assumed between 208 Tl and 228 Ac/ 212 Bi, which contribute events at lower E \u03b3 , the normalization of the 208 Tl background is correlated at the level of about \u221210% with the background from 214 Bi and the europium isotopes as determined from the likelihood fit. The small deviations observed in the E \u03b3 spectrum are due to mis-modelling of high energy \u03b3-ray interactions in the scintillator blocks.

Mis-modelling of energy loss for \u03b1 particles emitted from the central part of the 150 Nd source foil and inhomogeneities in the 214 Bi density within the foil can result in a large variation on the \u03b1 reconstruction efficiency.

To further improve the rejection of 214 Bi background, no more than one prompt Geiger hit that is unassociated with the electron tracks is allowed within 15 cm of the track vertices if the tracks are on opposite sides of the foil. If they are on the same side of the foil, no such hits are permitted. To improve the vertex and track reconstruction for events with electrons on the same side of the foil, each track must have a hit in the first Geiger layer closest to the source foil. This implies that the tracks are isolated from each other, since tracks can not share Geiger hits in the reconstruction.

We observe strong correlations between several sources of background as discussed throughout Sec. V. The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal normalization, however, is largely uncorrelated with most backgrounds. The strongest correlation coefficient observed is \u221211% between the signal and the 234m Pa background.",

Taking this systematic uncertainty into account, the NEMO-3 result is within 2\u03c3 of the upper limit on the 214 Bi activity from the HPGe measurements. As it is not an important background in the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay in the 150 Nd foil, this discrepancy has no impact on the results of this analysis. The 207 Bi activity measured by NEMO-3 is lower than expected from the HPGe measurements due to the removal of the hot spots described in Sec. III. Without removal of these hot spots, the 207 Bi activity measured is 132.8 \u00b1 6.8 mBq/kg in the 1e1\u03b3 channel, which is consistent with the HPGe result. Finally, the measured activity of 40 K is nearly a factor of 2.5 larger than the HPGe limit. The HPGe detector is not efficient in detecting the high energy (1.46 MeV) \u03b3 ray produced in the electron capture of 40 K. In addition, it is possible that some additional 40 K contamination may have been introduced on the foil surface during the construction of the NEMO-3 detector.

V. The systematic uncertainty on the total number of events from internal 40 K and 234m Pa decays is estimated using the two-electron channel. As 40 K and 234m Pa are both predominantly \u03b2 emitters whose decay rates are constrained by the one-electron channel, they suffer from similar systematic uncertainties in twoelectron channel events. The source of the uncertainty is due to a combination of mis-modelling of M\u00f8ller scattering, energy loss, bremsstrahlung and tracking within the simulation and reconstruction. The systematic uncertainty for these isotopes is estimated by fitting their total contribution to the E tot distribution of the twoelectron channel, with their relative normalizations and the normalizations of all other components fixed to their best fit values. This results in a reduction in the 40  and 234m Pa total event rate that is treated as a symmetric \u00b110% systematic uncertainty on their normalization in the two-electron channel, leading to an uncertainty of \u00b12.5% on the measured T 2\u03bd 1/2 . The systematic uncertainty on the number of events from neighboring foil isotopes is estimated in a similar way. Allowing their total contribution to float with all other contributions fixed yields a reduction of the neighboring foil activity by 23%. Treated as symmetric, this translates into a \u00b10.5% effect on the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate. The effect of all background normalization uncertainties contributes [+2.8, \u22122.7]% to the total systematic uncertainty on the T 2\u03bd 1/2 measurement. Several additional sources of systematic uncertainty are investigated. The largest source of uncertainty is associated with the absolute normalization of \u03b5 2e (see Eq. 3). This uncertainty is estimated through the comparison of 207 Bi calibration source activities measured with the NEMO-3 detector and an HPGe detector. Using the 2e(N)\u03b3 channel to measure these sources yields activities that are in agreement with the HPGe measurements to within \u00b15.55%, which is taken as the uncertainty on \u03b5 2e .",

The half-life presented herein represents the most accurate measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life to date for this isotope due to a more thorough assessment of systematic uncertainties, leading to a relatively small reduction in the systematic uncertainty of \u2248 5.6% compared to Ref. [12]. Although the live time of the data has approximately doubled since [12], the statistical uncertainty has not improved significantly. This is due to an overall lower efficiency in accepted \u03b2\u03b2-decay events. This reduction in signal efficiency is caused by the increased minimum energy requirement for the electrons in addition to several more strict data quality criteria applied to the data. In particular, the use of the laser survey to reject events involving unstable PMTs has a large impact on the final selection efficiency [14]. Although these more stringent selection criteria have reduced the signal efficiency, they also provide a more stable sample of 2e events where the systematic uncertainties are better understood. ",

In the case of the mass mechanism and for decays involving RHCs, the total energy of the two electrons is equal to the Q \u03b2\u03b2 value of 150 Nd, as there are no other particles involved in the decay. Figure 8 shows the expected signal distributions in the high energy tail of the E tot distribution of the two electrons. The signals are shown with an arbitrary normalization compared to the expected backgrounds. There are 6 expected background events with E tot > 2.8 MeV, where \u2248 37% are from 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays of 150 Nd, 60% from internal 208 Tl decays, and 2% from internal 214 Bi decays.

However, the presence of a RHC in the electroweak Lagrangian results in a different angular distribution between the decay electrons when compared to the mass mechanism, and modifies their individual energy distributions as well [3]. A unique feature of the NEMO-3 detector among the current generation of \u03b2\u03b2-decay experiments is the ability to reconstruct the full topology of final state particles in each event, which provides an opportunity to determine the underlying decay mechanism, should 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay be observed [22]. This is demonstrated in Figs. 9 and 10, where the differences between underlying 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay mechanisms are shown for several kinematic observables in the two-electron channel.",

This is demonstrated by employing a multivariate analysis in the two-electron channel in the search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay modes of 150 Nd. A BDT analysis is performed using the TMVA package [13] in ROOT [23]. The BDT is trained on ten observables that demonstrate good agreement between data and the MC simulation: the total energy of the two electrons (E tot ); the higher (E max e ) and lower (E min e ) energy electron energies; the asymmetry between the electron energies defined as A E = (E max e \u2212 E min e )/E tot ; the track lengths associated with the higher (L max e ) and lower (L min e ) energy electrons; the opening angle between the two tracks (cos \u03b8); the internal probability distribution (P int ); and the curvature of the higher and lower energy electron tracks defined as (\u03c1 \u00d7 \u03ba) max,min , where \u03c1 is the charge in units of elementary electric charge e and \u03ba is the reciprocal of the radius of track curvature.

The individual electron energies provide some additional sensitivity, as their correlations are different between many of the backgrounds and the signals. For example, the higher energy electron from 208 Tl decays is primarily produced as a conversion electron with an energy of approximately 2.5 MeV, while the other electron is a \u03b2 particle with an average energy of approximately 0.56 MeV. In contrast, the electrons emitted in a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay mediated by the mass mechanism share energy equally on average. By identifying these correlations, the BDT is able to improve the separation between 208 Tl and m \u03bd decays. The other observables act as weakly classifying variables in the BDT algorithm, with relatively similar discriminating power provided by each of them. The internal probability distribution is useful primarily in discriminating between signal events and those from decays of external backgrounds and radon in the tracker volume. The track length distributions also provide some discriminating power since they are correlated with the electron energies and their opening angle.",

A modified frequentist approach is employed, which uses a binned log-likelihood ratio test statistic (CL s ) [24][25][26]. The quantity CL s is defined as the ratio CL s+b /CL b , where CL s+b is the p value of the data assuming the signal-plus-background hypothesis, and CL b is the p value assuming the background-only hypothesis. To obtain a limit at the 90% C.L., the signal strength is scaled until CL s = 1 \u2212 0.9. This method is useful in low background scenarios because taking the ratio mitigates the effects of under-fluctuating backgrounds that can otherwise lead to an overestimation of exclusion limits. Systematic uncertainties on background normalizations and signal efficiency are incorporated in the limit setting by fluctuating signal and background distributions by random numbers drawn from Gaussian functions with widths reflecting the magnitude of the systematic uncertainties.",

As there is no indication of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, lower limits are derived for each mechanism. The lower limit on the half-life obtained assuming the mass mechanism is T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.0 \u00d7 10 22 y at the 90% C.L. This corresponds to an upper limit on an effective neutrino mass of m \u03bd < [1.6 \u2212 5.3] eV. The use of a BDT technique to increase the discrimination between signal and background improves the expected sensitivity by approximately 11% compared to the results obtained using only the total energy distribution of the two electrons.

The exception is the limit for the coupling between neutrinos and majorons g ee with n = 1. The limit on g ee is comparable with results obtained using other isotopes with significantly larger exposures [14,38,41,42].

BDT score distributions resulting from the training for detecting 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays mediated via (a) a light Majorana neutrino exchange, (b) RHCs coupling LH quarks to RH leptons, (c) RHCs coupling RH quarks to RH leptons, and (d) the emission of majorons with spectral index n = 1. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis in each case as demonstrated by the observed p values (1 -CL b ). The 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate normalized to the number of excluded events at the 90% C.L. for each mechanism is shown stacked on top of the expected background rate.",

There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 10% on the HPGe measurements. Secular equilibrium between 214 Bi and 214 Pb is assumed. The same assumption is made for 208 Tl, 228 Ac, and 212 Bi, where the branching ratio of 35.94% is taken into account. Events from 207 Bi and 152,154 Eu are weighted by their respective half-lives as a function of the event time and are therefore reported as ofFebruary 1, 2003.  ",
