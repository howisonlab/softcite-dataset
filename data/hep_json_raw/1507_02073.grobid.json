            "text": "A sensitivity of the VEPP-2000 e + e \u2212 collider in a search for the rare decay \u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 has been studied. The inverse reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 is proposed for this search. We have analyzed a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 108 nb \u22121 collected with the SND detector in the center-of-mass energy range 520 \u2212 580 MeV and found no background events for the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 in the decay mode \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . In the absence of background, a sensitivity to B(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) of 10 \u22126 can be reached during two weeks of VEPP-2000 operation. Such a sensitivity is better than the current upper limit on B(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) by a factor of 2.3. Decays of pseudoscalar mesons to the pair of leptons P \u2192 l + l \u2212 are rare. In the Standard Model (SM) these decays proceed through the two-photon intermediate state as shown in Fig. 1 and therefore are suppressed by a factor of \u223c \u03b1 2 comparing with the P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, where \u03b1 is the fine structure constant. An additional suppression of (m l /m P ) 2 arises from the approximate helicity conservation, where m l and m P are the lepton and meson masses, respectively. So, the P \u2192 l + l \u2212 partial width is less than the two-photon width \u0393(P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) by a factor of \u223c \u03b1 2 (m l /m P ) 2 . The low probability makes these decays sensitive to possible contributions of new physics beyond the SM [1,2]. In the SM, the knowledge of the transition meson-photon form factor F (q 2 1 , q 2 2 ) for the \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 P vertex is needed for a \u0393(P \u2192 l + l \u2212 ) calculation, where q 2 1 and q 2 2 are fourmomenta squared of virtual photons in Fig. 1. The real 1) e-mail: druzhinin@inp.nsk.su and imaginary parts of the decay amplitude are usually calculated separately. The imaginary part \u2111(A) 2 is proportional to the form-factor value |F (0, 0)| 2 at q 2 1 = q 2 2 = 0 and, consequently, can be calculated using the known width of the P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. Since |A| 2 > \u2111(A) 2 , a model-independent lower boundary (unitary bound) on the P \u2192 l + l \u2212 width can be obtained from \u0393(P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) [3]. The real part of amplitude cannot be calculated in a model-independent way. In Ref. [4] it is shown that the real part depends on the integral over q 2 < 0 of the form factor in symmetric kinematics, F (q 2 , q 2 ). The ranges of predictions for the P \u2192 l + l \u2212 branching fractions obtained in different form-factors models [5,6] are listed in Table I. For comparison, the last column of Table I contains the current experimental values of the branching fractions. Currently, only two of the five decays are measured and for two more upper limits on the width exist. The value of B(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) agrees with the prediction but the measurement accuracy is low. The more precise value of B(\u03c0 0 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) differs from the prediction by about three standard deviations.",

At E = 540 MeV data taking was carried out with several values of the RF cavity voltage ranged from 18 kV to 36 kV. The values of \u03c3 Z varied from 16 to 12 mm, while the values of \u03c3 E from 120 to 160 keV. Below we will use the value of \u03c3 E = 150 keV as an estimate of the energy spread at E = m \u03b7 c 2 . In the proposed experiment the collider energy must be set and monitored with an accuracy better than \u03c3 E . This is provided by the beam-energy-measurement system based on measuring energies of Compton backscattered laser photons [19]. The accuracy of this method is about 60 keV. The system monitors beam energy continuously during data taking; the single measurement duration at E \u2248 550 MeV is about one hour.",

The main source of background is cosmic-ray events. For the search for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7, events with six or more detected photons and with the energy deposition in the calorimeter larger than 0.6E are selected. Background from events with charged particles is rejected by the selection condition that the number of fired wires in the drift chamber is less than four.

In Ref. [30] the data were fitted in several models, which at E = 550 MeV give the cross section value ranged from 6 to 16 pb.

This result is close to the upper limit B(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) < 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 set recently in the HADES experiment [8], in which \u03b7 mesons were produced in proton-nucleon collisions. With a VEPP-2000 luminosity of 0.34 \u00d7 10 30 cm \u22122 sec \u22121 the current upper limit can be reached in a week of data taking. In two weeks a sensitivity at the level of 10 \u22126 can be reached.",

In the absence of background, data with an integrated luminosity of 324 nb \u22121 provide a sensitivity of 10 \u22126 for B(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ). Such data may be accumulated in two weeks of VEPP-2000 operation. The sensitivity of 10 \u22126 is 2.3 times better than the current upper limit on B(\u03b7 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ).",
