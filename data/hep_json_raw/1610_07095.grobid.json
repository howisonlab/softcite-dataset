Both \u03a5(1S) candidates are fully reconstructed via their decays to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The fiducial acceptance region is defined by an absolute \u03a5(1S) rapidity smaller than 2.0. The fiducial cross section for the production of \u03a5(1S) pairs, assuming that both mesons decay isotropically, is measured to be 68.8\u00b112.7 (stat)\u00b17.4 (syst)\u00b12.8 (B) pb, where the third uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the branching fraction of \u03a5(1S) decays to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Assuming instead that the \u03a5(1S) mesons are produced with different polarizations leads to variations in the measured cross section in the range from \u221238% to +36%.",

            "text": "The measurement of quarkonium pair production in proton-proton (pp) collisions provides insight into the underlying mechanism of particle production. The production mechanisms of heavy-quarkonium pairs such as J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 are especially valuable as they probe these interactions in both perturbative and nonperturbative regimes [1]. In this paper, the first cross section measurement of \u03a5(1S) pair production, reconstructed in the four-muon final state, in pp collisions from the CERN LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV is reported. Proton collisions can be described by parton models [2] in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this framework, each colliding hadron is characterized as a collection of free elementary constituents. Because of the composite nature of hadrons, in a single hadronhadron collision two partons often undergo a single interaction (single-parton scattering, SPS). However, it is also possible that multiple distinct interactions (multiple-parton interactions, MPIs) occur, the simplest case being double-parton scattering (DPS). The SPS mechanism for heavy-quarkonium pair production can be described by a nonrelativistic effective theory [3] of QCD. However, contributions from the DPS mechanism are not addressed in a simple way within the framework of perturbative QCD [4], and DPS or MPIs are widely invoked to account for the observations that cannot be explained otherwise, such as the rates for multiple heavy-flavor production [5]. There are still large uncertainties owing to possible higher-order SPS contributions and the limited knowledge of the proton transverse profile [6]. Heavy-quarkonium final states are expected to probe the distribution of gluons in a proton since their production is dominated by gluon-gluon (gg) JHEP05 (2017)013interactions [7,8]. Cross section measurements of quarkonium pair production are essential in understanding SPS and DPS contributions and the parton structure of the proton.",

            "text": "Quarkonium pair production in pp collisions via DPS is assumed to result from two independent SPS occurrences [7,13]. Several DPS production processes, including final states with associated jets, are commonly described by an effective cross section (\u03c3 eff ) that characterizes the transverse area of the hard partonic interactions [14,15]. It is estimated as the product of single quarkonium production cross sections divided by the corresponding DPS quarkonium pair cross section [16]. Assuming the parton distribution functions are not correlated, \u03c3 eff is expected to be independent of the final state and the center-of-mass energy. Recent measurements of \u03c3 eff in final states with jets are in the range 12-20 mb [17-20]. However, measurements of J/\u03c8 pair [21] and J/\u03c8 +\u03a5(1S) [22] production in pp collisions yield values of 4.8 and 2.2 mb, respectively. From a fit to differential cross section measurements of J/\u03c8 pair production with CMS [23], Lansberg and Shao [24] estimate an effective cross section of 8.2 mb. In this paper, we report the first observation of \u03a5(1S) pair production and estimate \u03c3 eff using this result, along with theoretical predictions.",

First, an average efficiency using a data-embedding method, 1 , is calculated as the number of events surviving the trigger and reconstruction requirements, divided by the number of efficiency-corrected events N true . Alternatively, an average efficiency using the generator information, 2 , is determined as the number of events satisfying the trigger and reconstruction criteria, divided by the number of events generated within the muon and \u03a5 meson acceptance of the detector. Compared to the first method, the latter efficiency is based on the originally generated muon momenta. Then, the scaling factor is defined as the ratio 2 / 1 .

To estimate \u03c3 eff using the fiducial \u03a5(1S) pair production cross section \u03c3 fid , the following formula is used [7]: 2) where \u03c3(\u03a5) is the cross section for single-\u03a5(1S) production [43] extrapolated to the fiducial region (|y \u03a5 | < 2.0) and f DPS is the fraction of the DPS contribution. To estimate the JHEP05 (2017)013effective cross section, we use \u03c3(\u03a5) = 7.5 \u00b1 0.6 nb and a value of f DPS \u2248 10% [8], which gives \u03c3 eff \u2248 6.6 mb. The cross section for \u03a5(1S) pair production, assuming SPS with feeddown from higher \u03a5 states, is 48 pb [8]. This result, combined with our measurement, gives f DPS 30%, and with this estimation, \u03c3 eff is calculated to be \u22482.2 mb. These two estimates of \u03c3 eff are consistent with the range of values from the heavy-quarkonium measurements (2-8 mb)  [21,22], but are smaller than that from multijet studies (12-20 mb)  [17][18][19][20]. The quarkonium final states are dominantly produced from gluon-gluon interactions, while the jet-related channels that correspond to higher values of \u03c3 eff are produced by quarkantiquark and quark-gluon parton interactions. The trend in the measured effective cross section might indicate that the average transverse distance between gluons in the proton is smaller than between quarks, or between quarks and gluons.",

A signal yield of 38 \u00b1 7 \u03a5(1S)\u03a5(1S) events is measured with a significance exceeding five standard deviations. Using the measured muon kinematic properties in the data, an event-based acceptance and efficiency-correction method is applied, minimizing the model dependence of the cross section measurement. The fiducial cross section of \u03a5(1S) pair production measured within the single-\u03a5 acceptance |y \u03a5 | < 2.0 is found to be \u03c3 fid = 68.8 \u00b1 12.7 (stat) \u00b1 7.4 (syst) \u00b1 2.8 (B) pb, where the \u03a5(1S) decay into muons is assumed to be isotropic. Assuming instead that the \u03a5(1S) mesons are produced with different polarizations leads to variations in the measured cross section in the range from \u221238% to +36%. An effective cross section is also estimated using our result that is in agreement with the values from heavy-quarkonium measurements, but is smaller than that from multijet studies. Open Access.
