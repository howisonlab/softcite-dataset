The measurement is based on a sample of Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays reconstructed using the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb \u22121 . The acceptance is defined by the requirements 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5 and p T > 20 GeV for the pseudorapidities and transverse momenta of the leptons. Their invariant mass is required to lie in the range 60-120 GeV. The cross-section is determined to be \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) = 93.81 \u00b1 0.41(stat) \u00b1 1.48(syst) \u00b1 1.14(lumi) pb , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second reflects all systematic effects apart from that arising from the luminosity, which is given as the third uncertainty. Differential cross-sections are presented as functions of the Z-boson rapidity and of the angular variable \u03c6 * , which is related to the Z-boson transverse momentum.",

However, it is also desirable to examine the channel Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 , 1 which offers a statistically independent sample, with substantially different sources of systematic uncertainties. The main difficulty with electron reconstruction in LHCb is the energy measurement. A significant amount of material is traversed by the particles before they reach the magnet, and their measured momenta are therefore frequently reduced by bremsstrahlung, which cannot be recovered fully using the calorimeters because of saturation at an energy corresponding to a transverse momentum of around 10 GeV per channel. Consequently the initial electron directions are well determined, but their measured momenta are low by a variable amount, \u223c 25% on average. Therefore the rapidity of the Z boson, y Z , is well determined while its transverse momentum, p T , is",

The approach is essentially the same as that used in a previous study of the same channel at \u221a s = 7 TeV [4]. The current measurement, as well as being at a higher centre-of-mass energy, benefits from a significantly higher and more precisely determined integrated luminosity, and from stable trigger conditions. Futhermore, an improved Monte Carlo simulation of the detector and an improved modelling of electron bremsstrahlung are available. The determination is performed in the same kinematic region as the LHCb measurement of Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [3], namely 60 < M (Z) < 120 GeV and 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5 and p T > 20 GeV for the leptons.",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is in GeV.

Similarly, PID is the efficiency for identification of the tracks as electrons, GEC is the estimated efficiency of the global event cuts for these events and trig is the trigger efficiency. The determination of these contributions to the efficiency is performed separately in each bin of y Z or of \u03c6 * . The contributions that the terms in the efficiency make to the systematic uncertainty on the measurement are summarised in section 4. The tracking efficiency, track , gives the probability that, in events in which the electrons satisfy 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5, p T > 20 GeV and 60 < M (e + e \u2212 ) < 120 GeV at the particle level (i.e. based on their true momenta, as known in simulated events), both of them correspond to reconstructed tracks satisfying the track quality requirements. In order to characterise accurately the dependence of the efficiency on y Z and \u03c6 * , the efficiency is taken from simulation. A consistency check using data allows a systematic uncertainty to be assigned as described in section 4. The efficiency shows a significant dependence on y Z , but almost no variation with \u03c6 * .",

            "text": "Studies at 7 TeV [4] showed that the NNLO calculations based on Fewz fail to model the \u03c6 * distribution. It is expected that the \u03c6 * distribution, like that of p T , is significantly affected by multiple soft gluon emissions, which are not sufficiently accounted for in fixedorder calculations. The present data exhibit the same behaviour, and this comparison is not shown. The normalised distribution with respect to \u03c6 * is therefore presented in figure 5 (left) and compared with the ResBos, Powheg and Pythia 8.1 calculations. These all model the data reasonably well, especially at lower \u03c6 * where differences are typically up to the 10% level, while larger discrepancies are seen for \u03c6 * > 1. To show this more clearly, the ratios between the calculations that include higher orders and the data for the \u03c6 * distribution are also shown in figure 5 (right). The data tend to fall between the different models, indicating no clear preference for any of them. The same data and predictions normalised to the measurement in data, so that the measurements are shown as the shaded bands at unity. To aid clarity, small horizontal displacements are applied to some of the predictions. luminosity of 2.0 fb \u22121 recorded using the LHCb detector, is based on the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay. The acceptance is defined by the requirements 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5 and p T > 20 GeV for the leptons while their invariant mass is required to lie in the range 60-120 GeV. The cross-section is determined to be \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) = 93.81 \u00b1 0.41(stat) \u00b1 1.48(syst) \u00b1 1.14(lumi) pb ,",
