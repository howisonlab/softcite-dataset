            "text": "Studies of b baryon decays are of great importance for probing the dynamics of heavy-flavor decay processes. Since the observation of the lightest b baryon 0 b by the UA1 Collaboration [1] at the CERN SppS, followed by extensive studies at the Fermilab Tevatron by the CDF [2-11] and D0 [12][13][14][15][16][17] Collaborations, the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments have accomplished numerous 0 b baryon studies, made possible by the large production cross section of bb pairs at the CERN LHC. Among these studies are precision mass measurements of the ground and excited states [18,19], as well as lifetime and polarization measurements [20][21][22][23]. Most of these studies have been performed in the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 decay channel. Recently, an observation of the 0 b baryon decay to an excited charmonium state 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S) has been reported by the ATLAS Collaboration [24], while the LHCb Collaboration observed other, higher-multiplicity decays involving charmonium states [25,26]. Decays of the 0 b baryon also proved to be a rich source of exotic spectroscopy, as has been demonstrated by the observation by LHCb [27,28] of new pentaquark states P c (4312) + , P c (4380) + , and P c (4450) + in the invariant mass distribution of the J/\u03c8p system produced in the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8pK \u2212 decay. Further studies of the 0 b baryon decay modes involving charmonium states may shed E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. light on the strong interaction processes in hadronic decays of b baryons and on the production of exotic multiquark states.",

Consequently, the measurement of its branching fraction could enhance the understanding of the final-state strong interactions in b baryon decays and test heavy-quark effective theory [30]. In addition, the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decay is a baryonic analog of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + decay, where a rich resonant structure in the J/\u03c8\u03c6 system has been observed by several experiments [31][32][33][34]. Therefore, detailed studies of the J/\u03c8\u03c6 spectrum produced in baryonic decays may provide an important test for the production of these states. Recently, the existence of a hidden-charm pentaquark spectra was predicted for the J/\u03c8 final state [35], which can be investigated in the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decay, once a sufficient number of signal events is accumulated.",

To test this assumption, simulated samples were compared with background-subtracted data in a number of kinematic distributions. As a result of these studies, an additional systematic uncertainty is assigned to account for the observed difference between data and simulation in the 0 b rapidity distribution for the normalization channel, as well as for the difference in the twobody invariant mass distributions M(J/\u03c8 ), M(J/\u03c8\u03c6), and M( \u03c6) in data and simulation for the signal channel. The latter discrepancy could be caused by a deviation from the pure phase space decay model used in the simulation due to contributions from intermediate resonant states; however, the statistical power of the present data set is insufficient to perform a more detailed investigation. To estimate this systematic uncertainty, the simulated samples were reweighted to match the distributions observed in data.

The variation of the background model includes Bernstein polynomials of second and fourth orders, independently for the signal and normalization channels, and an exponential function for the background in the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution. For the signal channel, an additional background function with a threshold behavior is also tested: (x \u2212 x 0 ) \u03b2 multiplied by the Bernstein polynomials of first and second orders, where x 0 = M PDG J/\u03c8 + M PDG + M PDG \u03c6 and the exponent \u03b2 is allowed to vary freely in the fit. In each case, the maximum deviation in the measured signal yield within the variations of the background model is used as the systematic uncertainty. Another source of systematic uncertainty is the signal shape modeling in the M(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ), M(\u03c8(2S) ), and M(K + K \u2212 ) distributions. This uncertainty is estimated by using alternative signal models whose parameters were obtained by fitting the simulated invariant mass distributions. The variation of signal models includes a triple-Gaussian function and a sum of two Crystal Ball [47] functions for the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution; a sum of two Crystal Ball functions for the 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S) channel; and a convolution of a double Crystal Ball [48] and relativistic Breit-Wigner functions for the M(K + K \u2212 ) distribution. For each of the variations, the largest deviation in the measured signal yield is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The next source of systematic uncertainty is the difference in the mass resolution of the 0 b and \u03c6 peaks between data and simulation. To estimate this uncertainty, several variations were applied to the resolution functions in the M(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ) and M(\u03c8(2S) )distributions: only the ratio of the two Gaussian widths was fixed to the one measured in simulation instead of fixing both widths, as in the nominal fit. For the M(K + K \u2212 ) distribution, a fit with the fixed ratios of the two Gaussian widths and yields, as measured in simulation, is performed. In each case, the maximum variation in the measured 0 b yield is used as the systematic uncertainty. The difference between data and simulation in the measured 0 b mass resolution for the 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 channel results in the largest systematic uncertainty.",
