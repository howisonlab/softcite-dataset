The signal contribution is determined in each of the four samples with fits to the B 0 mass distributions, as described in section 4. A key ingredient for measurements of CP violation in time-dependent analyses is the determination of the flavour of the neutral B mesons by means of tagging algorithms, described in section 5. The evaluation of instrumental asymmetries that affect the measurement of the overall CP charge asymmetry A D * D is discussed in section 6. A simultaneous fit to the B 0 decay-time distributions of the four samples is performed to determine the CP parameters, as described in section 7.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [12], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [13,14] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty JHEP03(2020)147 that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. During the data taking, the polarity of the magnetic field was periodically reversed to reduce the residual detection asymmetries that affect the determination of charge asymmetries. The minimum distance of a track to a primary collision vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [15]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [16].",

In order to test if the likelihood estimate for the CP parameter values are accurate, the same mass and decay-time models as used for JHEP03(2020)147 data are fitted to 2000 pseudoexperiments. For each pseudoexperiment, four samples are generated corresponding to the four data samples. In each sample, the input parameters for the signal component are the same as in the fit to data, except for the production and tagging asymmetries, which are set to zero for convenience. The CP parameters, the JHEP03(2020)147 tagging efficiencies and the coefficients of the splines describing the time acceptance are taken from the best fit result to data. All the parameters that are constrained in the fit are set to values randomly generated according to the constraints applied.

While \u2206S D * D is related to the relative strong phase between the decay amplitudes, the parameter \u2206C D * D is a measure of how flavour specific the decay mode is. For a flavour-specific decay only one final state is accessible for each flavour of the decaying neutral B meson, \u2206C D * D = \u00b11 and no CP violation in the interference between decays with and without mixing is possible. Decays with JHEP03(2020)147 \u2206C D * D = 0 present the highest sensitivity to mixing-induced CP violation. In the case of B 0 \u2192 D * \u00b1 D \u2213 decays, if the contribution of higher-order SM processes and NP are negligible, the amplitudes for B 0 \u2192 D * + D \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 D + have the same hadronic phase and magnitude. As a result, A D * D , C D * D , \u2206C D * D and \u2206S D * D vanish and S D * D = sin(2\u03b2).",
