The nominal selection requirements are imposed on the ensemble and the surviving pseudocandidates are used to construct templates for the kinematic distributions, notably the inclusive QCD background m \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 and p \u03bc\u03bc T distributions. The background from Z \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 decays is modeled with templates derived from a sample of simulated Z boson events with m \u03bc\u03bc in the \u03d2\u00f0nS\u00de mass region. To validate this background model with data, the sidebands of the m \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 distribution in several validation regions, defined by relaxed kinematic or isolation requirements, are used to compare the prediction of the background model with the data.

The details of the composition do not enter directly the background estimation for this search, but the composition itself is a crucial input in feasibility studies for future searches or measurements, where projections of these backgrounds to different center-of-mass energies or luminosity conditions are needed. To facilitate this study, the selection requirements on m \u03bc\u03bc and jL xy =\u03c3 L xy j are relaxed to include the sideband regions.

The photon (both converted and unconverted) and muon reconstruction and identification efficiency uncertainties are estimated to be 0.5% (0.7%) and 0.4% (0.4%) for the Higgs boson (Z boson) signal, respectively. An uncertainty on the integrated luminosity of 2.8% is derived using the method described in Ref. [48]. The photon energy scale uncertainty, determined from Z \u2192 e \u00fe e \u2212 and validated using Z \u2192 ll\u03b3 decays [49], is propagated through the simulated signal samples as a function of \u03b7 \u03b3 and p \u03b3 T . The uncertainty associated with the description of the photon energy scale in the simulation is found to be less than 0.2% of the three-body invariant mass while the uncertainty associated with the photon energy resolution is found to be negligible relative to the overall three-body invariant mass resolution. Similarly, the systematic uncertainty associated with the muon momentum measurement is determined using data samples of J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 and Z \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 decays and validated using \u03d2\u00f0nS\u00de \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 decays [43].
