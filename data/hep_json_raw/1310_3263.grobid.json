Furthermore, extending the event selection of a top property measurement in the l+jets channel to include three-jet events can reduce the acceptance bias [1] and reduces systematic uncertainties related to jet reconstruction, as events with one unreconstructed jet are still used. The three-jet sample can also be interesting in its own right.",

The distributions of the differences and ratio between reconstructed and generated observables for these two algorithms, shown in similar in quality to that of the full reconstruction. Table 1 uses the FOM introduced in Section 4.1 to quantitatively compare the performance of the two algorithms. As the generated distributions differ between the l+3 jets and the l+\u22654 jets samples, there is some arbitrariness in such a comparison. To quantify this arbitrariness, for the l+\u22654 jets samples each FOM was evaluated twice, once using the quantiles found in the l+\u22654 jets sample and once using the quantiles found in the l+3 jets sample.  Fig. 8b). Though the tail behavior of the reconstructions varies, the variations are limited to a fraction of events much smaller than the 10% we consider in each category. Thus the choice of offsets has little effect on the comparison of reconstruction techniques.
