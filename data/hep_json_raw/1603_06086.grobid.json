            "text": "A new kind of matter, called dark matter (DM), which does not absorb or emit light, has been postulated since the early '30s of the past century [1] and its existence is now widely accepted [2]. However, its interpretation is still among the greatest and fascinating enigmas of Physics. The current paradigm assumes that the DM is a thermal relic from the Big Bang, accounting for about 24% of the total energy density of the Universe [2] and producing effects only through its gravitational interactions with large-scale cosmic structures. To include the DM in a particle theoretical framework, the Standard Model (SM) is usually complemented with many extensions [3][4][5][6][7] that attribute to the DM candidates also strong self interactions and weak-scale interactions with SM particles. Among the possible candidates, a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) aroused much interest since a particle with weakscale annihilation cross section can account for the DM relic abundance estimated through the study of the cosmic microwave background [2]. The force carrier in WIMP annihilations could be a new gauge vector boson, known as U boson, dark photon, \u03b3 or A , with allowed decays into leptons and hadrons. Its assiduous worldwide search has been strongly motivated by the astrophysical evidence recently observed in many experiments [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] and by its possible positive one-loop contribution to the theoretical value of the muon magnetic moment anomaly [15], which could solve, partly or entirely, the well known 3.6 \u03c3 discrepancy with the experimental measurement [16].",

In this framework the dark photon would act like a virtual photon, with virtuality q 2 = m 2 U . It would couple to leptons and quarks with the same strength and would appear (its width being much smaller than the experimental mass resolution) as a narrow resonance in any process involving real or virtual photons. The coupling to the SM photon would occur by means of a vector portal mechanism [3], i.e. loops of heavy dark particles charged under both the SM and the dark force. The strength of the mixing with the photon is parametrized by a single factor \u03b5 2 = \u03b1 /\u03b1 which is the ratio of the effective dark and SM photon couplings [3]. The size of the \u03b5 2 parameter is expected to be very small (10 \u22122 -10 \u22128 ) causing a suppression of the U boson production rate. The U boson decays into SM particles would happen through the same mixing operator, with the corresponding decay amplitude suppressed by an \u03b5 2 factor, but are still expected to be detectable at high luminosity e + e \u2212 colliders [17][18][19]. KLOE has already searched for radiative U boson production in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 U\u03b3, U \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 processes [20,21]. The leptonic channels are affected by a decrease in sensitivity in the \u03c1-\u03c9 region due to the dominant branching fraction into hadrons.

The collected data were simulated including \u03c6 decays and leptonic processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 + \u2212 \u03b3(\u03b3), = e, \u03bc. The main background contributions affecting the ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 sample are the resonant e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 process and the ISR and FSR e + e \u2212 \u2192 + \u2212 \u03b3(\u03b3), = e, \u03bc processes (they will be defined as \"residual background\" in the following). We reduced their contribution by applying kinematic cuts in the M trk -M 2 \u03c0\u03c0 plane, as explained in Refs. [29,30]. M 2 \u03c0\u03c0 is the squared invariant mass of the two selected tracks in the pion mass hypothesis while M trk is the mass of the charged particles associated to the tracks, computed in the equal mass hypothesis and assuming that the missing momentum of the event pertains to a single photon. 1 Distributions of the M trk variable for data and simulation are shown in Fig. 1, where the M trk > 130 MeV cut to discriminate muons from pions is also indicated.",

We thus extracted the mass dependent limits on \u03b5 2 at 90% confidence level (CL) by means of the CL S technique [33]. The procedure requires as inputs the measured invariant mass spectrum, the estimated irreducible total background and the U boson signal for each M \u03c0\u03c0 bin. The measured spectrum is used as input without any efficiency or background correction. The signal is generated varying the U boson mass hypothesis in steps of 2 MeV. At each step, a Gaussian peak is built with a width corresponding to the invariant mass resolution of the dipion system. The systematic uncertainties were taken into account by performing a Gaussian smearing of the evaluated background according to the estimates in Section 5 and Fig. 6. The results of the statistical procedure are shown in Fig. 8 in terms of the number N CLS of U boson signal events excluded at 90% CL.",

The uncertainties on H , eff , L, and I, propagate to the systematic error on \u03b5 2 via eq. (1). The resulting uncertainty on \u03b5 2 is lower than 1% and has been taken into account in the estimated limit. Fig. 9 shows the results from eq. (1) after a smoothing procedure (to make them more readable), compared with limits from other experiments in the mass range 0-1 GeV. Our 90% CL upper limit on \u03b5 2 reaches a maximum value of 1.82 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 529 MeV and a minimum value of 1.93 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 985 MeV.
