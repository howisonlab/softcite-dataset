The systematic uncertainty do to this 874 background is determined by using the data alone. In this 875 way, contributions from these backgrounds are treated as 876 signal and inflate the signal yield and background size 877 in Eq. (15). The difference in the branching fraction is 878 0.03%, which is considered a negligible contribution to 879 the systematic uncertainty. 880 Differences in the effect of the 6C kinematic fit on the 881 data and MC samples may cause a systematic difference 882 in the acceptance corrected signal yield. This effect was 883 investigated by loosening the restriction on the \u03c7 2 from 884 the 6C kinematic fit. For events with a M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 above 885 KK threshold, this restriction was relaxed from less than 886 60 to be less than 125. Events with an invariant mass 887 below KK threshold are required to have a \u03c7 2 less than 60 888 rather than less than 20. The difference in the branching 889 fraction for the results with the loosened \u03c7 2 cut relative 890 to that of the nominal results is about 0.1%. 891 Another source of systematic uncertainty in the 892 branching fraction is the difference between the nomi-893 nal results and those obtained by applying a model that 894 describes the \u03c0\u03c0 dynamics. To test this effect, a mass 895 918 tion quantum numbers. The mass independent analysis 919 was performed under the assumption that only the 0 ++ 920 and 2 ++ amplitudes are significant. To test this assump-921 tion, the analysis was repeated with the addition of a 922 4 ++ amplitude. No significant contribution from a 4 ++ 923 amplitude is apparent.",

One 929 of the resonances was an f 4 (2050), which was generated 930 in each component of the 4 ++ amplitude. The relative 931 size of the 4 ++ amplitude was determined from a mass 932 dependent fit to the data, in which the 4 ++ amplitude 933 contributed 0.43% to the overall intensity. A mass inde-934 pendent amplitude analysis, which did not include a 4 ++ 935 amplitude, was then performed on this sample. The re-936 sults indicate that the intensities and phases for the 0 ++ 937 and 2 ++ amplitudes deviate from the input parameters 938 at the order of the statistical errors from the data sample 939 in the region between 1.5 and 3.0 GeV/c 2 . Therefore, the 940 systematic error due to the effect of ignoring a possible 941 4 ++ amplitude is estimated to be of the same order as 942 the statistical errors in the region from 1.5 to 3.0 GeV/c 2 . 943 VI.

While the analysis strategy employed 950 to obtain results has complications, namely ambiguous 951 solutions, a large number of parameters, and potential 952 bias in subsequent analyses from non-Gaussian effects 953 (see Appendix C), it minimizes systematic bias arising 954 from assumptions about \u03c0\u03c0 dynamics, and, consequently, 955 permits the development of dynamical models or param-956 eterizations for the data.",

            "text": "(Dated: June 1,2015) An amplitude analysis of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system produced in radiative J/\u03c8 decays is presented. In particular, a piecewise function that describes the dynamics of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system is determined as a function of M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 from an analysis of the (1.311 \u00b1 0.011) \u00d7 10 9 J/\u03c8 decays collected by the BESIII detector. The goal of this analysis is to provide a description of the scalar and tensor components of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system while making minimal assumptions about the properties or number of poles in the amplitude. Such a model-independent description allows one to integrate these results with other related results from complementary reactions in the development of phenomenological models, which can then be used to directly fit experimental data to obtain parameters of interest. The branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 is determined to be (1.15\u00b10.05)\u00d710 \u22123 , where the uncertainty is systematic only and the statistical uncertainty is negligible.   as a \"mass dependent fit\", that is, the model used to fit 219 the data has an assumed s dependence.",

INTRODUCTION 120 While the Standard Model of particle physics has 121 yielded remarkable successes, the connection between 122 the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the complex 123 structure of hadron dynamics remains elusive. The light 124 isoscalar scalar meson spectrum (I G J P C = 0 + 0 ++ ), for 125 example, remains relatively poorly understood despite 126 many years of investigation. This lack of understand-127 ing is due in part to the presence of broad, overlapping 128 states, which are poorly described by the most accessible 129 analytical methods (see the \"Note on scalar mesons below 130 2 GeV\" in the PDG) [1].

In particular, the lightest 137 glueball state is expected to have scalar quantum num-138 bers [2-5]. The existence of such a state is an excellent 139 test of QCD. Experimental observation of a glueball state 140 would provide evidence that gluon self-interactions can 141 generate a massive meson. Unfortunately, glueballs may 142 mix with conventional quark bound states, making the 143 identification of glueball states experimentally challeng-144 ing. The low mass scalar meson spectrum is also of inter-145 est in probing the fundamental interactions of hadrons in 146 that it allows for testing of Chiral Perturbation Theory 147 to one loop [6]. 148 The scalar meson spectrum has been studied in many 149 reactions, including \u03c0N scattering [7], pp annihilation [8], 150 central hadronic production [9], decays of the \u03c8 \u2032 [10], 151 J/\u03c8 [11-13], B [14], D [15], and K [16] mesons, \u03b3\u03b3 for-152 mation [17] and \u03c6 radiative decays [18]. In particular, a 153 coupled channel analysis using the K-matrix formalism 154 has been performed using data from pion production, 155 pp and np annihilation, and \u03c0\u03c0 scattering [19]. Similar 156 investigations would benefit from the inclusion of data suggest that only the 0 ++ and 2 ++ amplitudes are sig-169 nificant in radiative J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The neutral 170 channel (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) is of particular interest due to the lack 171 of sizable backgrounds like \u03c1\u03c0, which present a challenge 172 for an analysis of the charged channel (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [20]. 173 Radiative J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 have been analyzed pre-174 viously by the MarkIII [21], DM2 [22], and BES [23] ex-175 periments. Decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 were also studied at Crystal 176 Ball [24] and BES [25], but these analyses were severely 177 limited by statistics, particularly for the higher mass 178 states. Each of these analyses reported evidence for 179 the f 2 (1270) and some possible additional states near 180 1.710 GeV/c 2 and 2.050 GeV/c 2 . More recently, the BE-181 SII experiment studied these channels and implemented 182 a partial wave analysis [20]. Prominent features in the re-183 sults include the f 2 (1270), f 0 (1500), and f 0 (1710).

[20] 190 have relied on modeling the s-dependence of the \u03c0\u03c0 inter-191 action, where s is the invariant mass squared of the two 192 pions, as a coherent sum of resonances, each described 193 by a Breit-Wigner function. In doing so, a model is built 194 whose parameters are resonance properties, e.g. masses, 195 widths and branching fractions. A correspondence ex-196 ists between these properties and the residues and poles 197 of the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitude in the complex s plane; 198 however, this correspondence is only valid in the limit 199 of an isolated narrow resonance that is far from open 200 thresholds (cf. Ref. [1]). For regions containing mul-201 tiple overlapping resonances with large widths and the 202 presence of thresholds, all of which occur in the 0 ++ \u03c0\u03c0 203 spectrum, an amplitude constructed from a sum of Breit-204 Wigner functions becomes an approximation. While such 205 an approximation provides a practical and controlled way 206 to parameterize the data -additional resonances can be 207 added to the sum until an adequate fit is achieved -it is 208 unknown how well it maintains the correspondence be-209 tween Breit-Wigner parameters and the analytic struc-210 ture of the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude that one seeks to study, i.e., 211 the fundamental strong interaction physics. Often sta-212 tistical precision, a lack of complementary constraining 213 data, or a limited availability of models leaves the simple 214 Briet-Wigner sum as a necessary but untested assump-215 tion in analyses, thereby rendering the numerical result 216 only useful in the context of that assumption.

In this way, multiple solutions may give comparable 535 values of \u22122 ln L for a particular fit. For this particular 536 analysis, two types of ambiguities are present.

The phase difference be-551 tween the other amplitudes and that which is constrained 552 can then be determined in each mass bin.553 As mentioned above, a set of trivial ambiguities arises 554 due to the possibility of the overall amplitude in each bin 555 to be rotated by \u03c0 or to be reflected over the real axis 556 in the complex plane.

The bins below about 0.6 GeV/c 2 also contain multiple solutions, but with different likelihoods and are attributed to local minima in the likelihood function. The nominal solutions below 0.6 GeV/c 2 are determined by requiring continuity in each intensity and phase difference as a function of M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 .

A definitive statement on the number and properties of the scattering amplitude poles in this region of the spectrum requires model-dependent fits to the data. The effectiveness of any such model-dependent study could be greatly enhanced by including similar data from the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3KK in an attempt to isolate production features from partial widths to KK and \u03c0\u03c0 final states. Additional structures are present in the 0 ++ amplitude below 0.6 GeV/c 2 and near 2.0 GeV/c 2 . It seems reasonable to interpret the former as the \u03c3 (f 0 (500)). The latter could be attributed to the f 0 (2020). The presence of the four states below 2.1 GeV/c 2 would be consistent with the previous study of radiative J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c0\u03c0 by BE-SII [20]. Finally, the results presented here also suggest two possible additional structures in the 0 ++ spectrum that were not observed in Ref. [20]. These include a structure just below 1 GeV/c 2 , which may indicate an f 0 (980), but the enhancement in this region is quite small. There also appears to be some structure in the 0 ++ spectrum around 2.4 GeV/c 2 .

The D functions are the familiar Wigner D-matrix elements. The angular momentum of the photon, J \u03b3 , is related to the nuclear radiative (E1, M2, E3, etc.) transitions. Each amplitude is characterized by the angular momentum of the photon and the angular momentum of the pseudoscalar pair. The possible values of J \u03b3 are limited by the conservation of angular momentum. The helicity of the radiative photon is given by \u03bb \u03b3 . The total angular momentum and polarization of the J/\u03c8 are given by J and M, respectively. Finally, N j = 2j+1 4\u03c0 is a normalization factor. The angles (\u03c6 \u03b3 , \u03b8 \u03b3 ) are the azimuthal and polar angles of the photon in the rest frame of the J/\u03c8, where the direction of the J/\u03c8 momentum defines the x-axis. The angles (\u03c6 \u03c0 , \u03b8 \u03c0 ) are the azimuthal and polar angles of one \u03c0 0 in the rest frame of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 pair, with the -z axis along the direction of the photon momentum and the xaxis is defined by the direction perpendicular to the plane shared by the beam and the z-axis. Parity is a conserved quantity for strong and electromagnetic interactions. Hence, for J/\u03c8 radiative decays, P = (\u22121) j must be positive. This means that the only intermediate states available have j P = 0 + , 2 + , 4 + , etc. Additionally, isospin conservation in strong interactions requires I G for the intermediate state to be 0 + (isoscalar).
