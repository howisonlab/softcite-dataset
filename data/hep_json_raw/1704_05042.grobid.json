            "text": "This paper presents the search for two modes of double beta (\u03b2\u03b2) decay of 134 Xe. \u03b2\u03b2 decay is a second-order weak transition between two nuclei with the same mass number and nuclear charges that differ by two units. This process can only be observed if the single beta (\u03b2) decay is strongly suppressed or forbidden by energy conservation. The mode with emission of two antineutrinos and two electrons (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) is an allowed decay by the Standard Model (SM) and has been directly observed in nine nuclei [1]. Among them, 136 Xe presents the longest half-life of 2.165 \u00b1 0.016 (stat.) \u00b1 0.059 (syst.) \u2022 10 21 yr [2]. The hypothetical neutrinoless mode with emission of two electrons and nothing else (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) does not conserve lepton number and, if observed, would imply that neutrinos are massive Majorana particles [3]. The most stringent lower limits derived for the half-life of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 in 136 Xe are 1.1\u202210 26 yr [4] and 1.1\u202210 25 yr [5] at 90% confidence level (CL).",

Unique to this work, the energy threshold was extended to lower energies as required by the \u03b2\u03b2 searches in 134 Xe. As will be discussed in Sec. III, each decay mode was analyzed independently, using a different energy threshold. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and reconstruction processes were improved, as detailed in Sec. II, to further improve the agreement between data and MC. Another change with respect to previous EXO-200 analyses is the use of the full set of data between June 2011, and February 2014, corresponding to a 25% increase in livetime (EXO-200 Phase-I).",

Furthermore, internally generated \u03b2-like events in the fiducial volume (FV) are uniformly distributed in the LXe, in contrast to the spatial distribution of background events arising from \u03b3-rays entering the TPC. This difference is captured in the analysis by the standoff-distance variable, defined as the shortest distance between any event cluster and the closest material that is not LXe, other than the cathode.

For these purposes, a GEANT4-based application [19] is part of the EXO-200 MC simulation software, as described in [2]. The collaboration has been gradually implementing changes into this package to better describe the measurements with the detector [13]. For this analysis, the simulation was updated to incorporate three important effects, in order to improve the spectral agreement with data at low energies. First, since electronegative impurities can capture electrons drifting in the LXe, the charge collection is exponentially attenuated with drifting distance before the simulation of the electronics pulse shapes. The average electron lifetime included in the simulation is based on calibration measurements (\u03c4 e = 4.5 ms). In addition, a more realistic light response of the APDs is included, which is now based on EXO-200 data to account for the complexity of optical propagation in the detector, such as internal reflections. Finally, the diffusion of the drifting electrons has been incorporated following the EXO-200 measurement of the transverse coefficient in LXe at the nominal drift field of 380 V/cm (D = 55 cm 2 /s) [20]. The energy calibration relies on data acquired with radioactive \u03b3 sources deployed near the detector [2]. The energy scale and resolution are simultaneously determined by fitting the expected energy spectra, as generated by MC, to the corresponding calibration data [13]. These fits were performed with a reduced energy threshold suited for both \u03b2\u03b2 decay searches of 134 Xe. The effective livetime-weighted average of the resolution in this analysis is \u03c3/E = 1.60% and 3.56% for SS events at the Q-value of 136 Xe and 134 Xe, respectively. To reach this result, a sophisticated de-noising algorithm was developed optimizing the energy resolution in the presence of correlated noise from the APD electronics [21].",

The improvements described in Sec. II produce an agreement between data and MC better than 10% for energies above 600 keV, as shown in Fig. 1. The agreement worsens below this energy and reaches 30% near 460 keV in SS events induced by \u03b3-rays from calibration sources. The effects of these discrepancies are discussed in Sec. IV. The standoff-distance agreement was not observed to degrade at low energies when compared to previous EXO-200 analyses. Following a similar procedure from previous analyses [2,5,13,14], the search for each \u03b2\u03b2 decay mode of 134 Xe was performed independently using a binned negative log-likelihood (NLL) function to fit simultaneously both SS and MS events with their corresponding probability density functions (PDFs), as generated by MC, in energy and standoff-distance. Five Gaussian constraints, presented in Sec. IV, were included in the NLL function to incorporate the systematic uncertainties independently evaluated for each search, in a similar approach as [2]. The SS fraction of each component, defined by the ratio of the number of SS events to the total number of events (SS/(SS+MS)), parametrizes the proportion of counts assigned to SS and MS PDFs. Unlike previous analyses, these searches used non-uniform bin widths, which optimize the calculation speed without decreasing the experimental sensitivity. In particular, the standoffdistance binning partitions the LXe in equal volumes. A profile-likelihood scan was then performed to derive the limits at 90% CL using a profile-likelihood ratio (\u2206NLL) of 1.35, under the assumption of Wilks's theorem [22,23], which applies, given the large statistics of the data set in the region of interest.",

The 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay requires the lowest possible energy threshold, in order to maximize the signal detection efficiency and discrimination power between low-energy backgrounds, while keeping the systematic errors arising from the spectral agreement at reasonable levels. Because all these effects are propagated into the profile-likelihood ratio, the sensitivity (obtained through fits of toy data sets generated by the background model) was evaluated with energy thresholds varying between 400 keV and 500 keV, in steps of 20 keV, and found to be optimal in the region between 460 keV and 480 keV (with negligible differences within this range). The choice of 460 keV can then be motivated by its signal detection efficiency, 5.6% as opposed to 4.5%. On the other hand, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 detection efficiency is nearly maximal, 89%, for all energies below 760 keV. The energy threshold of this search is then selected at 740 keV, sufficiently away from the low-energy background components, even when accounting for the energy resolution.

The standoff-distance ratios, as well as those for energies above 850 keV, were found to be negligible contributors. 60 Co and 238 U-related PDFs were weighted by ratios using data from the calibration sources 60 Co and 226 Ra, respectively, while the other \u03b3-like PDFs were weighted by ratios obtained with a 228 Th source. \u03b2-like PDFs were weighted using ratios from the background subtracted 136 Xe-2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 spectrum (Fig. 1), since these are also uniformly distributed in LXe. Approximately 10,000 toy datasets were drawn from these un-skewed PDFs, which were scaled by values arising from a data fit by the background-only model (without a signal PDF), while the number of signal counts included in the toy fits was manually set. These toy data sets were then fit using the normal PDFs and the average difference (bias) between the manually set and best-fit number of signal counts determined. This bias was found to be roughly constant at 2250 cts (240 cts) for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) analysis. The difference between these factors demonstrates the impact of the spectral discrepancy at low energies.",
