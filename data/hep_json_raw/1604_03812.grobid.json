The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search selects events with at least six energetic jets and uses a boosted decision tree algorithm to discriminate between signal and Standard Model background. The dominant multijet background is estimated using a dedicated data-driven technique. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an upper limit of 6.4 (5.4) times the Standard Model cross section is observed (expected) at 95% confidence level. The best-fit value for the signal strength is \u00b5 = 1.6 \u00b1 2.6 times the Standard Model expectation for m H = 125 GeV. Combining all ttH searches carried out by ATLAS at \u221a s = 8 and 7 TeV, an observed (expected) upper limit of 3.1 (1.4) times the Standard Model expectation is obtained at 95% confidence level, with a signal strength \u00b5 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.8.",

While any deviation from SM predictions would indicate the presence of new physics, all measurements of the properties of this new boson thus far performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including spin, parity, total width, and coupling to SM particles, are consistent with the SM prediction [7][8][9][10][11][12].",

The coupling y t is experimentally accessible by measuring the gluon fusion (ggF) production process or the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay, where a sizeable contribution derives from a top-quark loop. This case requires the assumption that no new physics contributes with additional induced loops in order to measure y t . Currently, the only process where y t can be accessed directly is the production of a top-quark pair in association with a Higgs boson (ttH).",

            "text": "The results of searches for the Higgs boson are usually expressed in terms of the signalstrength parameter \u00b5, which is defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected number of signal events. The latter is calculated using the SM cross section times branching ratio [13]. The combined ttH signal strength measured by the CMS Collaboration [14], obtained by merging searches in several final states, is \u00b5 = 2.8 \u00b1 1.0. The ATLAS Collaboration has searched for a ttH signal in events enriched in Higgs boson decays to two massive vector bosons or \u03c4 leptons in the multilepton channel [15], finding \u00b5 = 2.1 +1.4 \u22121.2 , for ttH(H \u2192 bb) [16] in final states with at least one lepton obtaining \u00b5 = 1.5 \u00b1 1.1, and for ttH(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) [17] measuring \u00b5 = 1.3 +2.6 \u22121.7 . Among all ttH final states, the one where both W bosons from t \u2192 W b decay hadronically and the Higgs boson decays into a bb pair has the largest branching ratio, but also the least signal purity. This paper describes a search for this all-hadronic ttH(H \u2192 bb) decay mode. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 at center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.",

For this analysis, a data-driven method is applied to estimate the multijet background by extrapolating its contribution from a control region with the same jet multiplicity, but a lower multiplicity of jets containing b-hadrons than the signal process. The parameters used for the extrapolation are measured from a control region and checked using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Other subdominant background processes are estimated using MC simulations. To maximise the signal sensitivity, the events are categorised according to their number of jets and jets identified as containing b-hadrons (b-tagged). A boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm, based on event shape and kinematic variables, is used to discriminate the signal from the background. The extraction of \u00b5 is performed through a fit to the BDT discriminant distribution. After the fit the dominant uncertainty is the tt + bb production cross JHEP05(2016)160 section. The sensitivity is also limited by systematic uncertainties from the data-driven method used for the modelling of the large non-resonant multijet production.",

An additional thin LAr presampler covers |\u03b7| < 1.8.

The Sherpa+OpenLoops sample is not passed through full detector simulation. Thus, tt + jets events from Powheg+Pythia are categorised into three non-overlapping samples, tt + bb, tt + cc, and tt + light-jets, hereafter called tt + light, using a labelling based on an algorithm that matches hadrons to particle jets. Then, tt + bb events from Powheg+ Pythia are reweighted to reproduce the Sherpa+OpenLoops NLO tt + bb prediction. The reweighting is done at generator level using a finer categorisation to distinguish events where one particle jet is matched to two b-hadrons, or where only one b-hadron is matched. The reweighting is applied using several kinematic variables such as the top-quark p T , the tt system p T , and, where this can be defined, \u2206R and p T of the dijet system not originating from the top-quark decay [16].",

After measuring \u03b5 MJ , the probability of b-tagging a third jet in a sample of events with at least two b-tagged jets, the TRF MJ method uses \u03b5 MJ to extrapolate the multijet background from the regions with lower b-tag multiplicity to the search regions with higher b-tag multiplicity but otherwise identical event selection. In the first step, the b-tagging rate is measured in data samples selected with various single-jet triggers, which are enriched in multijet events and have limited (\u224810%) overlap with the search region. The events in this TRF MJ extraction region are required to have at least three jets with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, with at least two b-tagged jets. Excluding the two jets with the highest b-tagging weight in the event, \u03b5 MJ is defined as the rate of b-tagging any other jet in the event. It is parameterised as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7, and also of the average \u2206R between this jet and the two jets in the event with highest b-tagging weight, \u2206R (j,hMV1) . The p T and \u03b7 dependence of \u03b5 MJ reflects the corresponding sensitivity of the b-tagging efficiency to these variables. In multijet events, the \u2206R dependence of \u03b5 MJ is correlated with the multi-b-jet production mechanism. This affects \u03b5 MJ , shown in figure 1, which decreases by up to a factor two as \u2206R increases for fixed p T and \u03b7.",

This is performed using the same data samples that were employed to estimate \u03b5 MJ . In these low jet multiplicity samples, the TRF MJ method, which is applied to the events with exactly two b-tagged jets, is used to predict distributions in events with at least three b-tagged jets. Using \u03b5 MJ derived independently in data and simulation, the predicted distributions are compared to those resulting when directly applying b-tagging. This is done for a number of variables, such as b-tagged jet p T , angular distance between b-tagged jets, and event shapes. As an example, for events with at least three jets and at least three b-tagged jets (\u22653j, \u22653b), figure 2 shows the closure test in data for the thirdleading-jet p T , H T (the scalar sum of the p T of all jets), and Centrality Mass (defined as H T divided by the invariant mass of the jets). Figure 3 shows the results of the closure test in simulated multijet events for distributions of the leading-jet p T , the minimum mass of all jet pairs in the event (m min jj ), and the third-leading b-tagged jet p T . The definitions of these variables can be found in table 3. In both data and simulated multijet events with at least three b-tagged jets, the predicted and observed number of events agree within 5%. In events with a higher b-tagged jet multiplicity the numbers agree within the large statistical uncertainty. For this reason the systematic uncertainties related to the TRF MJ method are not estimated in the validation regions.   Not all jets are reconstructed at the trigger level, mainly due to the Level-1 sliding window algorithm and the Level-1 resolution [70]. The multijet trigger efficiency with respect to the offline selection is derived in terms of the efficiency for a single jet to be associated with a complete jet trigger chain, i.e., a complete sequence of jets reconstructed at Level-1, Level-2 and EF satisfying the requirements described in section 4. This single-jet trigger efficiency, trig , is evaluated in intervals of offline reconstructed p T and \u03b7:",
