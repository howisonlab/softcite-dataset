            "text": "The interpretation of the CP violation mechanism is one of the most controversial aspects of the Standard Model. Many extensions of Standard Model predict that there are new sources of CP violation, beyond the single Kobayashi-Maskawa phase in the quark-mixing matrix (CKM). Considerations related to the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe imply that such new sources should exist. The non-leptonic decays of B mesons are effective probes of the CKM matrix and sensitive to these potential new physics effects. The large production cross section of B hadrons of all kinds at the Tevatron allows extending such measurements to B 0 s decays, which are important to supplement our understanding of B 0 meson decays.",

This may provide useful information to solve the current discrepancy between the asymmetries observed in the neutral A CP (B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and charged mode A CP (B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 ) [3].

In the off-line analysis, we chose the selection cuts minimizing the expected uncertainty of the physics observables to be measured (through several \"pseudo-experiments\"). We used two different sets of cuts, respectively optimized to measure the CP asymmetry A CP (B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) (loose cuts) and to improve the sensitivity for discovery and limit setting [5] of the not yet observed B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + mode. The resolution in invariant mass and in particle identification (dE /dx ) is not sufficient for separating the individual on an event-by-event basis, therefore we performed a Maximum Likelihood fit which combines kinematic and particle identification information to statistically determine both the contribution of each mode, and the relative contributions to the CP asymmetries. We performed two separate fits: one on the sample selected with loose cuts and one on the sample selected with tight cuts. Significant signals are seen for B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , and B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 , previously observed by CDF [6]. Three new rare modes were observed for the first time B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 , with a significance respectively of 8.2\u03c3, 6.0\u03c3 and 11.5\u03c3, estimated using a p-value distribution on pseudo-experiments. No evidence was obtained for B 0 s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or B 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 mode. Table 1. Results on data sample selected with loose cuts (top) and tight cuts (bottom). Absolute branching fractions are normalized to the the world-average values B(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (19.7\u00b10.6)\u00d710 \u22126 and f s = (10.4\u00b11.4)% and f d = (39.8\u00b11.0)% [3]. The first quoted uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic. N s is the number of fitted events for each mode. For rare modes both systematic and statistical uncertainty on N s was quoted while for abundant modes only the statistical one. For the \u039b 0 b modes only the ratio",

We measured for the first time in the B 0 s meson system the direct CP asymmetry A CP (B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = 0.39 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.08. This value favors a large CP violation in B 0 s meson decays, although it is also compatible with zero. In Ref. [2] a robust test of the Standard Model or a probe of new physics is suggested by comparison of the direct CP asymmetries in B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. Using HFAG input [3] we input the B(B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) measured here, and the world-average for A CP (B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and B(B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [3], we estimate the expected value for A CP (B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) \u2248 0.37 in agreement with our measurement.

An improved systematic uncertainty is expected for the final analysis of the same sample. The results for the B 0 are in agreement with world-average values [3]. A CP (B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = \u22120.086\u00b10.023\u00b10.009 is already competitive with the current B-Factories measurements.",

The variables used are the invariant mass of the B 0 s candidates in the D s \u03c0 hypothesis and the dE /dx of the B 0 s daughter track. With a data sample of integrated luminosity Ldt 1.2 fb \u22121 we observe for the first time B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 decays, with a yield of 109\u00b119 events corresponding to a statistical significance of 7.9\u03c3. We measured its branching fraction normalized to B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + mode:",
