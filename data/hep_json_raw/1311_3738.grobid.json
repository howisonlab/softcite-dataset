            "text": "Neutrinos emitted from all past core-collapse supernovae should form an isotropic flux. Sometimes called the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), these neutrinos will be referred to as Supernova Relic Neutrinos (SRN) herein. Many models have been constructed to predict the SRN flux and spectrum [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Although all six types of neutrinos are emitted from a core-collapse supernova, SRN's are most likely detected via the inverse beta decay (IBD) reaction\u03bd e p \u2192 e + n in existing detectors. Super-Kamiokande (SK) has previously carried out searches for SRNs from the expected IBD positrons without requiring the detection of a delayed neutron, placing an integral flux limit for E\u03bd e > 17.3 MeV (E\u03bd e \u2248 E e + + 1.3 MeV) in the absence of a signal [14,15]. Since the detector cannot directly differentiate electrons from positrons (the positron annihilation signal is below Cherenkov threshold in water), these searches suffer from background of electrons and positrons. Some of these potential backgrounds include atmospheric neutrino \u03bd e /\u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 /\u03bd \u00b5 charged-current interactions and atmospheric neutrino neutral-current interactions. Many background channels either do not produce neutrons or more than one neutron, but they can generate an electron or positron that passes all of the selection criteria, thereby contaminating the candidate samples. Spallation backgrounds have limited the lower anti-neutrino energy threshold in previous SRN searches at SK.",

In the summer of 2008, SK's front-end electronics were upgraded, after which began the data-taking period known as SK-IV. A major part of this upgrade was to use a 60 kHz periodic trigger to seamlessly read out all PMTs all the time. In this data stream, events are searched for by a software trigger, which is based on the number of coincident PMT hits within 200 ns. To search for delayed-coincidence 2.2 MeV \u03b3's, a new coincidence level was introduced: a super-high-energy (SHE) event requires at least 70 coincident PMT hits corresponding to about 10 MeV (this level was lowered to 58 or about 8 MeV in the summer of 2011). SHE events contain all PMT hits from 5 \u00b5s before the SHE trigger time to 35 \u00b5s afterwards. The 5 \u00b5s of data prior the SHE trigger time provides a chance to catch pre-activity events, e.g. a prompt \u03b3-ray in a sub-Cherenkov muon background event produced by an atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 interaction with oxygen. SHE events without coincident outer detector activity are always followed by an after trigger (AFT) which contains all PMT hits of the subsequent 500 \u00b5s. The SK-IV data set used in this analysis was taken from November 22, 2008, to December 27, 2011, with a total livetime of 960 days.",

            "text": "The IBD candidate search can be divided into two steps: one to find the prompt signal with an energy ranging from 12 to 30 MeV in the SHE trigger data; the other to tag the IBD signal through the detection of a delayed event shortly after a prompt event is found. The timing window for the delayed event ranges from 2 to 535 \u00b5s following the prompt event. To avoid PMT signal reflection at the SK front-end electronics after an event, the delayed event search starts two \u00b5s after the prompt event time (defined by a GPS-synchronized clock). The prompt events are selected by applying a number of cuts to suppress muoninduced spallation background, atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, and low energy radioactivities. Details of the selection criteria for the prompt events, such as the spallation cut, pre/post activity cut etc, can be found in [15]. Unlike the analysis in [15], the reconstructed Cherenkov angle is required to be greater than 38 and less than 50 degrees. Also, the solar cosine angle cut of [15] is loosened Table 1: Summary of the selection criteria for the prompt events (N e + ) with energy E e + ranging from 12 to 30 MeV, the number of events surviving each cut and the evaluated efficiency (\u01ebe) from the large mixing angle model [7]. Errors are statistical only. to 0.9 for energies below 16 MeV because of neutron tagging. The number of remaining solar neutrino events in the sample is estimated to be about two events. Table 1 gives a summary of the event selection. Most efficiencies are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation except for that of the spallation cut. The overall systematic uncertainty of the primary event efficiency is \u223c3.3% due to uncertainties in the IBD cross section (1.0%), and the data reduction (3.1% as given in [15]), which are added in quadrature. An average 2.2 MeV \u03b3 event in SK produces about seven recorded PMT hits, all of which share a common orientation in both time and space, but most of the hits have various arrival times due to the different travel distances. The flat timing distribution for these signal hits can be sharpened to form a timing peak if the common orientation or vertex is known. However, the continuous 50 MHz dark noise and radioactive background for all the PMTs render a stand-alone reconstruction very difficult because of the long neutron lifetime. Fortunately, since neutrons produced in IBD quickly thermalize and are eventually captured by hydrogen with a mean free path length of \u223c50 cm, to a good approximation the location for an emission of a 2.2 MeV \u03b3 can be treated to share a common vertex with the prompt event, for which the reconstructed position resolution is 40\u223c50 cm. The reconstructed vertex for the prompt event is therefore used to calculate the path length to each hit PMT, in order to subtract the time-offlight (TOF) from the measured light arrival time. Due to a PMT timing resolution of 3 ns, the hits of real signal events cluster within a 10 ns window, while hits due to PMT dark noise, radioactivity in the surrounding rock, radon contamination events in water, and so on are typically more spread out since the light does not originate from the primary event vertex. A 10 ns sliding window is then applied to search for every timing peak and to give the number of PMT hits (N 10 ). Fig. 1 shows the distribution of N 10 for a 2.2 MeV \u03b3 signal and background, in which the signal events are from Monte Carlo simulation, while the background events are from the random trigger data.",

A cut on the quantity of N 10 \u2212N cluster is required to be greater than 5. Since most of the light of a 2.2 MeV gamma originates from a single Compton electron, most hits are in the same detector hemisphere, while PMT noise is distributed more uniformly. As a result, a summed vector is calculated for all the hits in N 10 . Angles between the individual vector for each hit and the summed vector are computed, giving the number of hits with an angle greater than 90 \u2022 (N back ). The delayed event should be N 10 \u2212N back > 6, which removes events with many background hits in the backward hemisphere.

The efficiency of the delayed event is corrected with a factor of \u223c92% due to the 533 \u00b5s time window. It is observed that most delayed events cannot fire sufficient PMTs to meet the minimum requirement on N 10 . Basing the TOF correction on the SRN candidate vertex (rather than the true vertex of the delayed event) changes the efficiency of finding delayed events by at most 2.5% relatively. Uniformity of both the MC signal efficiency and the background probability were studied using 110 positions within the detector. These spatial variations of MC signal efficiency and background probability were found to be 5.9% and 16.8%, respectively. These variations were then assigned to the systematic uncertainties. Therefore, the efficiency and the background probability for the delayed events are (17.74\u00b10.04 stat. \u00b11.05 sys. )% and (1.06 \u00b1 0.01 stat. \u00b1 0.18 sys. )%, respectively.

The experimental apparatus was deployed at certain positions in the SK tank, during which the forced trigger gate for catching the 2.2 MeV \u03b3's was temporarily enlarged to 800 \u00b5s in order to obtain a more complete neutron lifetime spectrum. To get the time distribution of the source-related background and accidental background, 10 Hz of 800\u00b5s random trigger data was also taken. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of time differences (\u2206T) between the delayed events and the prompt events, which is fitted with an exponential plus a constant with the signal fraction as a free parameter, to give the neutron lifetime in water. In order to verify the neutron lifetime time and examine possible position dependence of detection efficiency, the source was deployed at three different locations: at the center of the tank, close to the wall, and close to the top. All of the resulting lifetime measurements were consistent within one standard deviation. The average neutron lifetime in water was found to be (203.7 \u00b1 2.8)\u00b5s. The efficiencies measured at the three locations are in agreement within 10%, which also agrees with the estimation of Monte Carlo simulation.

There are 13 IBD candidates observed consistent with accidental background events evaluated to be 10 \u00b1 1.7. Two out of these 13 primary events with electron energies around 12 MeV are observed to have two neutron candidates, which indicates they are likely to be from spallation backgrounds with high neutron multiplicity.

This is achieved by changing the cut on the Cherenkov angle \u03b8 C of the primary event, in which an electron/positron is defined with 38 \u2022 < \u03b8 C < 50 \u2022 . The \u00b5 \u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 events are defined with \u03b8 C < 38 \u2022 , while the NC events are defined with \u03b8 C > 50 \u2022 . There are 144 primary \u00b5 \u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 candidate events with 22 delayed candidates and 489 NC candidate events with 47 delayed candidates. A clear neutron lifetime curve is observed in both delayed candidate samples, showing that the primary events are indeed accompanied by neutrons. The flat timing offset distribution for the delayed candidates in Fig. 3 does not show significant leakage from these two types of physical backgrounds. The number of atmospheric\u03bd e events is estimated to be 0.1, while the number of the\u03bd \u00b5 events is about 1.0. The later is due to the\u03bd \u00b5 charged-current interaction, which produces a delayed neutron and a positron from an invisible \u00b5 + Michel decay. In absence of a significant signal the Rolke method [20] is used to convert the number of observed and expected background events n obs = 13 and n bkg = 10.0 \u00b1 1.7 to a 90% C.L upper limit of 80.1 events in total or 30.5 events/22.5 (kton\u2022year), taking into into account the IBD detection efficiency \u01eb. Table 3 lists the expected number of SRN events in 22.5 kton\u2022year for different models.

Fig. 4   (LMA model [7]). In that search, SRN signal and atmospheric neutrino backgrounds were fitted to the energy spectra of the data for three different samples differentiated by the reconstructed Cherenkov angle with an extended unbinned maximum likelihood method. The SRN signal populates the single electron-like sample (38 \u2022 < \u03b8 C < 50 \u2022 ) below 30 MeV (signal region). Various types of atmospheric neutrino background dominate the background region above 30 MeV as well as the other two (background) samples. To compare with the SK-IV differential limits in this paper, the previous SK background spectra as well as the SRN candidate positron spectra above 30 MeV (total energy) were fit to only atmospheric neutrino background contributions. The resulting background fit was extrapolated in the signal region between 16 and 29.5 MeV (total positron energy) taking into account statistical and systematic uncertainties. The data was divided into nine bins of 1.5 MeV. Fig. 4 shows the 90% C.L. upper flux limits derived for each bin based on the background expectations with Gaussian uncertainties and the IBD cross section evaluated at the bin center. Below 17.3 MeV spallation background increases exponentially, so SRN detection in that energy range is very difficult without neutron tagging.

The neutron tagging efficiency is determined to be (17.74\u00b1 0.04 stat. \u00b1 1.05 sys. )%, while the corresponding accidental background probability is (1.06 \u00b1 0.01 stat. \u00b1 0.18 sys. )%. No appreciable IBD signal in the distribution of neutron lifetime is found using 960 days of data. The number of observed IBD candidates are consistent with the expected accidental background. A model-independent differential flux upper limit at SK is first derived from the previous 17.3 MeV threshold down to 13.3 MeV of the electron antineutrino energy.",

In addition, intense R&D is currently underway towards a gadoliniumenhanced SK. The higher signal detection efficiency and greater background rejection provided by neutron capture on gadolinium, as well as the lowered energy threshold it makes possible, are expected -in the not-too-distant future -to greatly improve SK \u2032 s sensitivity and ultimately provide the world's first observation of the SRN signal.",
