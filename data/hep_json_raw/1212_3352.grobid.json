A suite of dedicated experiments seek to shed light on how dark matter interacts with Standard Model (SM) particles by looking for detection of ambient dark matter either directly scattering with heavy nuclei or indirectly through its annihilation into high energy Standard Model particles. An important third pillar to the search for the particle nature of dark matter is furnished by high energy particle accelerators, which can produce pairs of dark matter particles, which are expected to manifest as an excess of events showing an imbalance in momentum conservation. Searches for missing transverse momentum are a major activity at the LHC precisely because of their potential connection to dark matter [1].",

Existing experimental studies have considered cases in which the visible radiation is a jet of hadrons (initiated by a quark or gluon) [2][3][4], a photon [5,6], or a W boson decaying into leptons [7]. These studies are performed in the context of an effective field theory (EFT) which captures the physics of a heavy particle mediating an interaction between dark matter and quarks and/or gluons. In this article, we extend the menu of such searches to include the case of a Z boson decaying into a pair of charged leptons (electrons or muons) and recast the recent ATLAS measurement of ZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd [8] into a bound on production of dark matter in association with a Z boson 1 . Since our signature consists of a pair of leptons consistent with a Z boson decay recoiling against transverse momentum carried by particles invisible to the detector, we refer to our selection as a \"mono-Z\" signature.",

In the case where interactions are primarily with quarks, the mono-Z signature arises from a Z boson which is radiated from a qq initial state, much like mono-jets or mono-photons. Such interactions also imply (depending on the specific form of the interaction) large rates for scattering with heavy nuclei. The case of direct interactions with a pair of Z bosons is more challenging to connect to direct detection (however, see [11]), and is a particular strength of collider searches. As usual, in both cases the EFT will break down at an energy not far above the one which characterizes the strength of the interactions written as higher dimensional operators, and is only a good description of the physics for processes taking place at energies well below this cut-off scale.",

It is worth noting that the fiducial acceptance is significantly higher for dark matter production than for the SM ZZ production due to the larger missing transverse momentum in the Z\u03c7\u03c7, as shown in Figure 3 for a sample parameter point with m \u03c7 = 100 GeV and \u039b = 1 TeV. For each interaction type, we determine the lower bound on the scale \u039b which characterizes its strength. The results are presented in Figure 4, which indicate that for some types of interactions, scales on the order of 100 GeV to TeV can be probed. For the case of interactions with quarks, we further translate these bounds into the plane of spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) scattering with nucleons, as related in [18]. These bounds are shown in Figure 5, along with bounds from CoGeNT [31] and Xenon 100 [32], and competing collider results from mono-jet and mono-photon searches. As is typical, bounds from colliders provide a unique probe of very light dark matter particles, and dominate as probes of spin-dependent interactions. Of course, the collider bounds are subject to the assumption that the EFT containing a contact interaction is a good description of the physics. In cases with light mediating particles, these bounds can sometimes be weaker. Over-all, the two searches exhibit a high degree of complementarity.",

We work in the context of effective field theories in which the dark matter either interacts directly with quarks, or with a pair of electroweak bosons. We derive limits on the strength of such interactions based on the recent ATLAS measurement of ZZ production (where one Z decays into charged leptons and the other into neutrinos) ands find that the current limits already probe the TeV scale for some types of interactions. For the case of interactions directly with quarks, the mono-Z signature provides limits which are somewhat weaker than those from mono-jets or mono-photons. Nonetheless, mono-Z searches are expected to be less subject to systematic uncertainties from jet energy scales and photon identification, and thus may scale better at large luminosities. If a discovery is made, the mono-Z signature offers a different way to dissect the couplings of up-type versus down-type quarks. If the dominant interaction is instead to pairs of weak bosons, colliders offer a unique opportunity for discovery.",
