The OPERA neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory used an upgraded setup compared to the 2011 measurements, improving the measurement time accuracy. An independent timing system based on the Resistive Plate Chambers was exploited providing a time accuracy of \u223c1 ns. Neutrino and anti-neutrino contributions were separated using the information provided by the OPERA magnetic spectrometers. The new analysis profited from the precision geodesy measurements of the neutrino baseline and of the CNGS/LNGS clock synchronization. The neutrino arrival time with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum is found to be \u03b4t \u03bd \u2261 T OF c \u2212 T OF \u03bd = (0.6\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b13.0 (syst.)) ns and \u03b4t\u03bd \u2261 T OF c \u2212T OF\u03bd = (1.7\u00b11.4 (stat.)\u00b13.1 (syst.)) ns for \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 , respectively. This corresponds to a limit on the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light of \u22121.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 < (v \u03bd \u2212 c)/c < 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 90% C.L. This new measurement confirms with higher accuracy the revised OPERA result.",

In this new run, both the Target Tracker (TT) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) were used independently. These detectors are briefly described in section 3. We report here the results obtained by each sub-detector separately and their combined result. Profiting from the information given by the muon spectrometers, results are provided separately for muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos present in the CNGS beam.

This test proved that it was possible, within a short period of two to three weeks of bunched beam, to obtain similar or even better accuracy for the neutrino velocity measurement compared to the statistical analysis applied to the data accumulated with the standard CNGS beam over years. The 2011 narrow-bunch beam had bunches separated by 524 ns yielding a total intensity of 1.1 \u00d7 10 12 protons per cycle. In the 2012 run with narrow-bunch narrow-spacing beam (BB) the bunch separation is only 100 ns in order to increase the number of delivered neutrinos per time unit. In each CNGS cycle, lasting 13.2 s, a single extraction delivers 4 batches of 16 proton bunches. Each 1.8 ns long (RMS) bunch contains \u223c10 11 protons providing an intensity 6 times higher than during the 2011 BB run. Figure 1 shows the proton waveform of one SPS extraction and figure 2 gives a closer view of 4 proton bunches, two at the end of the first batch and two at the beginning of the second one, as measured by a Beam Current Transformer (BCT) at CERN. The bunch spacing of 100 ns still allows to uniquely identify the proton bunch corresponding to a given neutrino interaction in the OPERA detector.",

The previous measurements of the neutrino velocity were affected by a jitter of \u00b125 ns due to the 1PPmS signal tagging with respect to the uncorrelated internal frequency of the 20 MHz MC. As a consequence, the timestamp of all hits recorded in the same 0.6 s DAQ cycle (the reset of the cycles is sent to all OPERA sensors every 600 1PPmS pulses) was shifted by the same quantity.
