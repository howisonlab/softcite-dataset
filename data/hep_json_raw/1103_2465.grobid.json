Within the SM, the contributions of c S and c P are negligible while c A is calculated with an accuracy of a few percent [2]. The dominant contribution stems from an electroweak penguin with a Z 0 decaying into two muons. However, the accuracy of the SM prediction for B(B 0 q \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) is limited by the knowledge of the decay constants of the B 0 q mesons. This limitation can be reduced by normalizing to the well-measured mass differences of the B 0 q mesons. Using this approach [3], the SM predictions are",

The VELO consists of a series of silicon modules, each providing a measure of the radial and azimuthal coordinates, with the sensitive area starting at 8 mm from the beam line during collisions. The tracking system comprises four layers of silicon sensors before the magnet and three stations equipped with silicon sensors in the inner part and straw tubes in the outer part after the magnet.

The distribution of observed events in the GL vs invariant mass plane can be seen in Fig. 4, and the observed number of events in each bin are given in Tables 3 and 4. The compatibility of the observed distribution of events in the GL vs invariant mass plane with a given branching ratio hypothesis is evaluated using the CL s method [20]. This provides two estimators: CL s is a measure of the compatibility of the observed distribution with the signal hypothesis, while CL b is a measure of the compatibility with the background-only hypothesis. The observed distribution of CL s as a function of the assumed branching ratio can be seen in Fig. 5. The expected distributions of possible values of CL s assuming the background-only hypothesis are also shown in the same figure as a green shaded area that covers the region of \u00b11\u03c3 of background compatible observations. The uncertainties in the signal and background likelihoods (Section 6) and normalization factors (Section 5) are used to compute the uncertainties in the background and signal predictions in Tables 3 and 4. These un- certainties are the only source of systematic uncertainty and they are included in the CL s using the techniques described in Ref. [20]. Given the specific pattern of the observed events, the systematic uncertainty on the background prediction has a negligible effect on the quoted limit. The effect of the uncertainty on the signal prediction increases the quoted limits by less than 3%.",

The efficiency of the muon identification requirement has been measured using an inclusive sample of J /\u03c8 events where one of the tracks does not use any information from the muon chambers. The efficiency measured with data agrees with MC expectations as a function of momentum within 2%, and the residual differences are taken into account in the systematic uncertainties.Events passing the two-body selection are consideredB 0 q \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212candidates if both tracks pass the muon identification criteria, and their invariant mass lies within 60 MeV/c 2 of the nominal B 0 q mass. The invariant mass of the B 0 q \u2192 h + h \u2212 candidates has to be within 600 MeV/c 2 of the nominal B 0 q mass. As the acceptance of the tracking stations is larger than the muon chambers, the selected B 0 q \u2192 h + h \u2212 candidates are required to have both tracks within the muon chamber acceptance to minimize the differences with B 0 q \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . The total efficiencies including acceptance, reconstruction and selection criteria on MC B 0 q \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B 0 q \u2192 h + h \u2212 events are 5.5% and 4.5% respectively; the main difference is due to material interactions.

The relative contributions of B 0 and B 0 s decays are fixed to their known values. The result of the fit for the mass resolution, \u03c3 = 25.8 \u00b1 1.0 MeV/c 2 , is consistent with the value obtained from the interpolation method. However, by varying the assumptions made for the parameters describing the partially reconstructed three-body b-hadron decays (physical background), the estimate obtained for the resolution can change by up to 2.7 MeV/c 2 . This is assigned as systematic uncertainty for this method. The weighted average of the two methods, \u03c3 = 26.7 \u00b1 0.9 MeV/c 2 , is taken as the invariant mass resolution and considered to be the same for B 0 and B 0 s decays.
