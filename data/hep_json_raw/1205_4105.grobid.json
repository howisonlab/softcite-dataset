            "text": "Introduction. -The pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced in high energy proton-proton (pp) collisions reflects the strong interaction dynamics that is only partly described by perturbative QCD. Nonperturbative models and parametrisations are used in the Monte Carlo (MC) event generators to describe the hadronisation of the partonic final states and to model diffractive processes [1,2]. In the forward region, where peripheral diffractive processes are important, the uncertainties are pronounced. A better understanding of these effects is also important for the interpretation of high energy showers recorded by cosmic ray experiments [3][4][5]. A direct measurement of the forward particle densities is, therefore, extremely valuable in constraining the theoretical models for particle production in pp interactions. The measurement of the charged particle pseudorapidity density (dN ch /d\u03b7) in the range 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.4 is presented here. This quantity is defined as the mean number of charged particles per single pp collision and unit of pseudorapidity \u03b7, where \u03b7 \u2261 \u2212ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], and \u03b8 is the polar angle of the direction of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction.",

            "text": "Experimental apparatus. -TOTEM is a dedicated experiment to measure the total cross section, elastic scattering and diffractive processes at the LHC [6,7]. The experimental apparatus [8], composed of three subdetectors (Roman Pots (RP), T1 and T2 telescopes), is placed symmetrically on both sides of Interaction Point (IP) 5, shared with the CMS experiment. All three subdetectors have trigger capability. The Roman Pot stations, equipped with silicon detectors and placed at 147 and 220 m from the IP, detect elastically and diffractively scattered protons with a small scattering angle down to a few \u00b5rad. The T1 and T2 telescopes, placed at about 8 and 14 m from the IP respectively, detect charged particles produced in the polar angular range of a few mrad to \u223c 100 mrad. The T1 telescope (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.7) consists of Cathode Strip Chambers, while the T2 telescope (5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5) is made of triple-GEM (Gas Electron Multipliers) chambers [9]. The present analysis is based on measurements with the T2 detector that consists of 2 quarters with 10 semicircular chambers each, on both sides of the IP. Each chamber provides two-dimensional information of the track position in an azimuthal coverage of 192 \u2022 with a small overlap region along the vertical axis between chambers of two neighbouring quarters [10]. Every chamber has a double layered read-out board containing two columns of 256 concentric strips (400 \u00b5m pitch, 80 \u00b5m width) for the measurement of the radial coordinate and a matrix of 1560 pads, each one covering \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u2243 0.06 \u00d7 0.018 rad, for the measurement of the azimuthal coordinate and for triggering. Radial and azimuthal coordinate resolutions are about 110 \u00b5m and 1 \u2022 , respectively [11]. The total material of 10 chambers amounts only to \u223c 0.05 X 0 [12]. The read-out of all TOTEM detectors is based on the \"VFAT\" front-end ASIC, which provides as output a digital signal and trigger [13].",

The description of the T2 detector is implemented within this framework. The GEM signal digitisation has been parametrised using a dedicated model that, after proper tuning, reproduces well the measured cluster (a group of neighbouring strip or pad channels) size and reconstruction efficiency as a function of the ionisation energy released in the gas by the incident particle, diffusion coefficient of the fill gas, chamber gain and the VFAT thresholds [12,17]. A special effort was devoted to understand and quantify secondary particles produced by the interaction of particles with the material in front of and around T2 and then seen in the detector. The simulation of the forward region, properly tuned with the data, showed that a large number of secondary particles is produced in the vacuum chamber walls in front of the detector, in the beam pipe conical section at |\u03b7| = 5.53 and at the lower edge of the CMS Hadron Forward (HF) calorimeter [18].",

The particle trajectory can, therefore, be successfully reconstructed using a straight line fit. The reconstructed tracks have at least 4 hits (pad clusters with or without an overlapping strip cluster), of which at least three have a pad/strip cluster overlap. A \u03c7 2 -probability greater than 1% is required for the straight line fit. Using a coordinate system with the origin located at the nominal collision point, the X axis pointing towards the centre of the LHC ring, the Y axis pointing upward (perpendicular to the LHC plane), and the Z axis along the counterclockwise beam direction, two geometrical track parameters are defined: Z 0 and ZImpact. Z 0 is the Z value at the position of the minimum approach of the track to the Z axis; the ZImpact parameter (see fig. 1) is the Z coordinate of the intersection point between the track and a plane (\"\u03c0 2 \") containing the Z axis and orthogonal to the plane defined by the Z axis and the track entry point in T2 (\"\u03c0 1 \"). Due to the short lever arm of the T2 detector (\u223c 40 cm) compared to the distance to the IP, the ZImpact and Z 0 resolution is of the order of 1 m. The relative position of the detector planes within a T2 quarter (internal alignment) and the overall alignment of all the detector planes with respect to their nominal position (global alignment) have been investigated in detail to define possible misalignment biases of the track measurements [17]. The most important internal alignment parameters which can be resolved within the T2 hit resolution are the shifts of the planes in the X and Y directions. Two different methods (iterative and MILLIPEDE [19]) were used to correct for such displacements. Both gave consistent results, with an uncertainty on the transverse position of the plane of about 30 \u00b5m. The relative alignment between the two neighbouring quarters was obtained using tracks reconstructed in the overlap region.",

The track ZImpact distribution, with the exponential and double Gaussian fit, is shown in fig. 2 for data tracks reconstructed in one T2 quarter in the 5.35 < \u03b7 < 5.4 range.

This extends the measurements performed by the other LHC experiments to this previously unexplored forward \u03b7 Fig. 3: Charged particle pseudorapidity density distribution. The experimental points (black squares) represent the average of the four T2 quarters, with the error bars including both statistical and systematic error. Red triangles, blue circles and orange diamonds show, respectively, the Phojet, Pythia8 and Sherpa predictions for charged particles with PT > 40 MeV/c in events where at least one charged particle is generated in the 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5 range. Measurement of the forward charged particle pseudorapidity density in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV range. The measurement refers to charged particles with P T > 40 MeV/c and with a mean lifetime \u03c4 > 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 s, directly produced in pp interactions or in subsequent decays of particles having a shorter lifetime. A preliminary measurement of the T2 visible inelastic cross section confirms that about 95% of the inelastic pp events have been considered in the present study. This comprises more than 99% of non-diffractive processes and the single and double diffractive processes with diffractive masses above \u223c 3.4 GeV/c 2 . The pseudorapidity density has been found to decrease with increasing |\u03b7|, from 3.84 \u00b1 0.01(stat) \u00b1 0.37(syst) at |\u03b7| = 5.375 to 2.38 \u00b1 0.01(stat) \u00b1 0.21(syst) at |\u03b7| = 6.375. Several MC generators have been compared to data; none of them has been found to fully describe the measurement.",
