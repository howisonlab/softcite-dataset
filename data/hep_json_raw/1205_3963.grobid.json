The observable is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction using primary charged tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV/c in |\u03b7| < 0.8. The mean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity (N ch ) is reported for events with different p T scales (\"soft\" and \"hard\") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading particle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus multiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity distributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with calculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse sphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a steeper rise at low N ch , whereas the event generators show an opposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean p T with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators produce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets resulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with tune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data, compared to the other tested generators.",

Their understanding is important for the interpretation of measurements of heavy-ion collisions, and in the search for signatures of new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Fermilab. e-mail: aortizve@cern.ch http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/ However, the wealth of experimental information is currently poorly understood by theoretical models or Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, which are unable to explain with one set of parameters all the measured observables. Examples of measured observables which are not presently well described theoretically include the reported multiplicity distribution [1][2][3], the transverse momentum distribution [4] and the variation of the transverse momentum with multiplicity [5][6][7].",

This method is often used in an attempt to characterize events by separating the different modes of production. It aims to divide the sample into two event classes: (a) events dominantly without any hard scattering (\"soft\" events) and (b) events dominantly with at least one hard scattering (\"hard\" events). Figure 1 shows the mean transverse sphericity versus maximum p T (p max T ) of the event obtained from minimum bias simulations at \u221a s = 7 TeV using the particle and event cuts described previously. Note that PYTHIA6 simulations (tunes: ATLAS-CSC [22], PERUGIA-0 and PERUGIA-2011 [23]) exhibit a maximum around 1.5-2.0 GeV/c, while PHOJET shows an intermediate transition slope in p max T = 1-3 GeV/c. This observation motivated the choice of the following separation cut: \"soft\" events are defined as events that do not have a track above 2 GeV/c, while \"hard\" events are all others. The aggregate of both classes is called \"all\". The selection of 2 GeV/c has been motivated in the past as an accepted limit between soft and hard processes [24]. For parton-parton interactions the differential cross section is divergent for p T \u2192 0, so that a lower cut-off is generally introduced in order to regularize the divergence. For example in PYTHIA6, the default cutoff is 2 GeV/c for 2 \u2192 2 processes. Table 1 shows the ratio of \"soft\" to \"hard\" events for ALICE data and the generators: PHOJET, PYTHIA6 (tunes ATLAS-CSC, PERUGIA-0 and PERUGIA-2011) and PYTHIA8 version 8.145 [25]. The ALICE ratios are corrected for trigger and vertexing inefficiency, it results in <2 % systematic uncertainty.

It characterizes the probability to have n interactions reconstructed as a single event. Furthermore, all events having two reconstructed interaction vertices, separated by more than 8 mm, and having at least 3 associated track segments in the SPD, were tagged as pile-up and rejected. The systematic uncertainty was estimated from the differences between results using runs with the smallest and largest pile-up probability, and for the \"all\" sample was found to be less than 0.2 %.

The most significant contribution to the systematic uncertainties is due to the correction method. It was estimated from MC by the ratio true-S T to corrected-S T as a function of multiplicity. For example, the largest uncertainty is at low multiplicity (N ch \u2248 3) for the \"hard\" sample, where it reaches \u223c11 %. Different sets of cuts were implemented in order to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to track selection. Table 2 summarizes the systematic uncertainties on S T . In addition, other checks were performed to ensure an accurate interpretation of the results. For instance, when applying the analysis to randomized events (where the track azimuthal angles are uniformly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0 ), we obtain results that are about 10 % larger than in data. The conclusion is that measured sphericity in data is not the result of a random track combination. Also, the analysis was applied to events with In the case of the mean transverse momentum as a function of multiplicity the systematic uncertainties are taken from [7], the only difference being the method of correction. The uncertainty was estimated by applying the correction algorithm to reconstructed events generated with PYTHIA6, while the correction matrices were computed using events generated with PHOJET. The final distributions were compared with the results at generator level. For the \"all\" sample the uncertainty reaches 1.5 %, while for \"soft\" and \"hard\" it reaches 1.0 % and 5.1 %, respectively.

The mean sphericity (right panel) increases up to around 15 primary charged particles, however, for larger multiplicities the ALICE data exhibit an almost constant or slightly rising behavior. For \"soft\" events and \u221a s = 0.9 TeV, the models are in agreement with the ALICE measurements over the full range of multiplicity, except for PYTHIA8 prediction, which is 5-10 % lower. There is in-sufficient statistics to perform the unfolding for N ch > 18. At 7 TeV, the differences between models and data are below 10 % for \"soft\" events. For the \"hard\" events, PHOJET, ATLAS-CSC, PERUGIA-0 and PYTHIA8 predict a lower S T than observed in data, actually the differences between models and data are larger than 10 % for multiplicities below 10 and larger than 40, that is true at 0.9 and 7 TeV. The differences observed are larger than the systematic and statistical uncertainties. It is interesting to note that PERUGIA-2011 describes the data quite well. The fraction of \"soft\" and \"hard\" events in data and MC simulations as a function of N ch (integral values given in Table 1) is found to be different between data and the event generators. At large N ch , the event generators generally produce more \"hard\" events than observed in data. This difference is reflected in the \"all\" event class, since more \"hard\" events contribute in the case of the generators, while more \"soft\" events in the case of data. The largest isotropy in the azimuth is found at high multiplicity, N ch > 40 (|\u03b7| < 0.8, p T > 0.5 GeV/c), in a similar pseudo-rapidity density region where the CMS collaboration discovered the long-range near-side angular correlations [27]. Comparing the results at 0.9 and 7 TeV, it is seen that except for PYTHIA8 the predictions of models describe better the 0.9 TeV data than the 7 TeV ones. Lastly, the mean sphericity evolution with multiplicity at the three measured energies are shown in Fig. 6 for \"soft\", \"hard\" and \"all\" events at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV. The functional form of the mean sphericity as a function of N ch is the same at all three energies in the overlapping multiplicity region.",

As seen in left panel, PERUGIA-0, PERUGIA-2011 and PYTHIA8 are within the systematic uncertainty bands of the data for soft events, though PYTHIA8 has a different functional form than the data. For the \"hard\" events there is a significant difference between the data and the generators above a multiplicity of about 20, in particular for the 7 TeV data. For lower multiplicities, ATLAS-CSC has an overall different shape than the other generators. For \"all\" events, at 0.9 TeV PERUGIA-0 and PERUGIA-2011 best reproduces the data, while the rest of the models do not give a good description. At 7 TeV, the calculations exhibit a change in the slope around N ch = 30, which is not observed in the data. At similar multiplici-ties, the MC mean sphericity reaches a maximum before it decreases with increasing multiplicity (Fig. 5). The similarity in the multiplicity dependence between S T and p T suggests that the models may generate more back-toback correlated high p T particles (jets) than present in the data. The behavior of averaged quantities does not illustrate the whole complexity of the events. For instance, events with the same multiplicity may have different transverse sphericity and depending on S T they have a different mean transverse momentum. To disentangle these kind of ambiguities among p T , S T and multiplicity, the normalized transverse sphericity spectra (the probability of having events of different transverse sphericity in a given multiplicity interval) are computed at 7 TeV for four different intervals of multiplicity: N ch = 3-9, 10-19, 20-29 and above 30. These are shown in Fig. 8 along with their ratios to each MC calculation. In the first multiplicity bin (N ch = 3-9), the agreement between data and MC is generally good, but in the second bin (N ch = 10-19) the ratio data to MC is systematically lower for S T < 0.4 except for PERUGIA-2011. In the last bin of multiplicity the overproduction of high S T events, believed to be due to back-to-back jets (in azimuth), reaches a factor of 3, and there is an underestimation of isotropic events by a factor 2. As in previous cases, the best description is done by PERUGIA-2011.",

The study is presented using MC generators at \u221a s = 7 TeV, but the conclusion also holds at the other two energies. Figure 9 shows p T as a function of S T for two multiplicity bins (top panels) along with the contribution of each sphericity bin (bottom panels) to the final p T , i.e. the p T weighted by the value P (S T ). There are two points to emphasize. First, a large dependence of p T on sphericity is observed for high multiplicities while at low ones the de-pendence is weaker. Second, the sphericity distribution determines the mean p T in a specific bin of multiplicity. For instance, for S T = 0.3-0.4 PHOJET and ATLAS-CSC have nearly the same value of p T , while the contribution to p T in the multiplicity bin is twice larger for PHOJET compared to ATLAS-CSC. Hence, the reproduction of the sphericity should be taking into account in the tuning of the MC generators.",

The observables are measured using primary charged tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV/c in |\u03b7| < 0.8 and reported as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity (N ch ) for events with different scales (\"soft\" and \"hard\") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading particle.

On the contrary, in ALICE data S T stays approximately constant or slightly rising (Fig. 5) accompanied with a mild increase in p T (Fig. 7). The mean sphericity seems to primarily depend on the multiplicity and not on \u221a s (Fig. 6). At high mul- tiplicity (N ch \u2265 30) the generators underestimate the production of isotropic events and overestimate the production of pencil-like events (Fig. 8). It seems that the generators tend to produce large multiplicity events by favoring the production of back-to-back high-p T jets (low S T ) more so than in nature. The level of disagreement between data and generators is markedly different for \"soft\" and \"hard\" events, being much larger for the latter (Figs. 5-7). It is worthwhile to point out that PERUGIA-2011 describes the various aspects of the data generally quite well, except for the mean p T , which it overestimates at high multiplicities. Our studies suggest that the tuning of generators should include the sphericity as an additional reference.",
