While the HBT radii modulations relative to the second harmonic event plane reflect mostly the spatial geometry of the source, the third harmonic results are mostly defined by the velocity fields [1]. Radii variations with respect to the third harmonic event plane unambiguously signal a collective expansion and anisotropy in the flow fields. Event shape engineering (ESE) is a technique proposed to select events corresponding to a particular shape. Azimuthally differential HBT combined with ESE allows for a detailed analysis of the relation between initial geometry, anisotropic flow and the deformation of source shape. We present azimuthally differential pion femtoscopy with respect to second and third harmonic event planes as a function of the pion transverse momentum for different collision centralities in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. All these results are compared to existing models. The effects of the selection of the events with high elliptic or triangular flow are also presented.",

            "text": "The correlation of two identical particles at small relative momentum, commonly known as intensity, or Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT), interferometry, is an effective tool to study the space-time structure of the emitting source in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [2]. Due to the position-momentum correlations in particle emission, the so-called HBT radii become sensitive to the collective velocity fields, from which information about the dynamics of the system evolution can be extracted. Azimuthally differential femtoscopic measurements can be performed relative to the direction of different harmonic flow planes [3]. In particular, measurements of the HBT radii relative to the second harmonic flow provide information on the final shape of the system, which is expected to become more spherical compared to the initial state due to stronger in-plane expansion. In contrast, the azimuthal dependence of the HBT radii relative to the third harmonic flow plane can originate only from the the anisotropies in collective flow gradients, and the observation of any HBT radii azimuthal dependence will unambiguously signals a collective expansion and anisotropy in the flow fields [1]. Event shape engineering (ESE) is a relatively new technique which selects on the magnitude of the flow vector [4]. This selection can provide more control on the initial shape of the source.",

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was used to reconstruct the tracks in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.8 as well as to identify pions. In addition to the TPC, the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector was used for identifying pions. The second and third harmonic event plane angles, \u03a8 2 and \u03a8 3 , were determined from the event plane method [5] using TPC tracks. To avoid self-correlation, each event was split into two subevents (-0.8 < \u03b7 <0 and 0 < \u03b7 <0.8). Pairs were chosen from one subevent and the event-plane angle was determined using the other subevent particles, and vice-versa, with the event plane resolution determined from the correlation between the event planes determined in different subevents [5]. The correlation function C(q) was calculated as the ratio of A(q) and B(q), where q = p 1 \u2212 p 2 is the relative 3-momentum of two pions, A(q) is the same-event distribution of particle pairs, and B(q) is the background distribution of uncorrelated particle pairs obtained using mixed events technique. The Bertsch-Pratt [6] outside-long coordinate system was used with the long direction pointing along the beam axis, out along the transverse pair momentum, and side being perpendicular to the other two.

We studied the effect of selecting the top 20% of the flow vector q 2 (q 3 ) on the magnitude of the flow v 2 (v 3 ). An enhancement of about 25% (15%) for v 2 (v 3 ) was observed for all centralities. Figure 4 shows the effect of large q 2 (q 3 ) selection on the relative amplitudes of the radii oscillations R 2 out,2 /R 2 side,0 (R 2 out,3 /R 2 side,0 ) and R 2 side,2 /R 2 side,0 ( R 2 side,3 /R 2 side,0 ). The large q 2 selection significantly enhances the relative amplitudes of the radius oscillations R 2 out,2 /R 2 side,0 and slightly enhanced R 2 side,2 /R 2 side,0 , possibly selecting more elliptic initial source. However, the large q 3 selection doesn't affect the relative amplitudes of the radius oscillations.",

The final-state source eccentricity is noticeably smaller than at lower collisions energies, but still exhibits an out-of-plane elongated source at freeze-out even after a stronger in-plane expansion. The negative signs of the relative amplitudes of radii oscillation, R out and R side , measured relative to the third harmonic flow plane, are an indication that the initial triangularity is washed-out or even reversed according to the 3+1D hydrodynamic calculations. The azimuthally differential HBT combined with ESE measurements were performed. The large q 2 selection has significant enhancement on the HBT radii relative to the second harmonic flow plane, whereas large q 3 selection has no effect on the HBT radii relative to the third harmonic flow plane.",
