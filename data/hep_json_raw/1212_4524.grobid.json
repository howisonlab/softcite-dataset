From this ratio we obtain the cross section \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). From the cross section we determine the pion form factor |F \u03c0 | 2 and the two-pion contribution to the muon anomaly a \u00b5 for 0.592 < M \u03c0\u03c0 < 0.975 GeV, \u2206 \u03c0\u03c0 a \u00b5 = (385.1 \u00b1 1.1 stat \u00b1 2.7 sys+theo ) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . This result confirms the current discrepancy between the Standard Model calculation and the experimental measurement of the muon anomaly.",

The quoted value differs from Standard Model estimates by 3.2-3.6 standard deviations [3][4][5][6]  1 . The difference between measurement and calculations is of great interest since it could be a signal of New Physics. The authors of Ref. 8 have proposed an interpretation in terms of Supersymmetry, which can be probed at the Large Hadron Collider. Another proposal suggests the existence of a light vector boson in the Dark Matter sector, coupled with ordinary fermions through photon exchange, which is not excluded by present low energy tests of the Standard Model [9,10]. A new round of measurements of a \u00b5 is expected at Fermilab [11] and J-PARC [12], with the aim of considerably reducing the experimental error. To fully exploit the significance of improved measurements of a \u00b5 it is important to confirm the present estimate of the hadronic corrections (see below) and possibly to decrease the corresponding error.",

Four types of events contribute to the above signature: 1: e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3, 2: e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 , 3: e + e \u2212 \u2192e + e \u2212 \u03b3, and 4: e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The four reactions can be distinguished kinematically. From the overdetermined system of kinematical constraints of the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 x + x \u2212 \u03b3, we can compute the common mass (m x ) of particles x + and x \u2212 . The four processes give m x = m \u00b5 , m \u03c0 , m e and > m \u03c0 . Additional separation between electrons and pions or muons is obtained from a particle identification (PID) estimator for each track, L \u00b1 , which uses time-of-flight information and the value and shape of the energy deposit of each charged particle in the calorimeter [16]. Figure 2 shows the fiducial volume we use for muons and unobserved photons which is identical to that used in Ref. 16 for e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3.",

To improve the MC description of the low energy m x tail of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 events in the muon peak, Fig. 3, we apply a data/MC resolution correction, function of s \u00b5 . This correction is evaluated from a high purity sample of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events, with the same track requirements used for \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 events, requiring in addition two photons with an invariant mass compatible with the \u03c0 0 mass, both for data and MC [26]. Figure 4 shows the comparison between data and MC before and after the resolution correction. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u03b3 background fractions as obtained by the fitting procedure are given in Table 1 at three s \u00b5 values. The estimated \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 fraction obtained from the fit procedure is consistent with the one expected from the theoretical cross section. Contributions from e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 processes are evaluated using the Nextcalibur [32] and Ekhara [33] MC generators. After analysis cuts, the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process is found to be negligible, while the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 background contribution is between 0.6% and 0.1%, in the low M 2 \u00b5\u00b5 region and is subtracted from the data spectrum [26]. Systematic errors in the background subtraction include: (i) Errors on the parameters from the fit procedure: these decrease monotonically from 0.7% to 0.1% with respect to s \u00b5 ; (ii) The uncertainty on the data/MC resolution corrections: about 1% in the \u03c1 mass region, smaller at higher s \u00b5 , negligible at lower s \u00b5 values; (iii) The uncertainty on the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 process: about 0.4% at low s \u00b5 values, rapidly falling to 0.1% for s \u00b5 > 0.5 GeV 2 .
