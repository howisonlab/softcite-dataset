The Belle detector is a large-solidangle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber, a system of aerogel Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillation counters and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to identify K 0 L mesons and muons. A detailed description of the detector can be found in Ref. [7]. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to estimate signal efficiencies and background contributions. Large samples of the signal B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 decays are generated with the EvtGen package [8] using the ISGW2 model [9].

Reconstruction of the B tag strongly suppresses the combinatorial and continuum backgrounds and provides kinematical constraints on the signal meson (B sig ). In this study we take advantage of the clean signature provided by the D * meson occurring on the signal side and reconstruct the B tag \"inclusively\" from all the particles that remain after selecting candidates for B sig daughters. We apply the analysis to B sig decay chains that combine a high reconstruction efficiency with a low background level. The D * \u2212 mesons are reconstructed in the D * \u2212 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 decay channel.

We do not include the \u03c4 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5\u03bd\u03c4 mode because in the relevant momentum range the muon identification is inefficient. The \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 +\u03bd \u03c4 channel has higher combinatorial background than the purely leptonic mode, but the single neutrino in \u03c4 decay provides better kinematical constraints.

The summation is over all particles that are not assigned to B sig and satisfy the selection criteria described above. We require that events have at least one (D * \u2212 e + /\u03c0 + ) pair and that M tag and E tag satisfy M tag >5.2 GeV/c 2 and |\u2206E tag | <0.6 GeV. To improve the quality of the B tag reconstruction, we impose the following requirements: zero total event charge, no \u00b5 \u00b1 and no additional e \u00b1 in the event, zero net proton/antiproton number, residual energy in the ECL (i.e. the sum of energies of clusters that do not fulfill the requirements imposed on photons) less than 0.35 GeV and number of neutral particles on the tagging side N \u03c0 0 + N \u03b3 <5. These criteria, which we refer to as \"the B tag -selection\", reject events in which some particles were undetected and suppress events with a large number of spurious showers. In order to validate the B tag simulation and reconstruction, we use a control sample of events, where the B sig decays to D * \u2212 \u03c0 + (followed by D * \u2212 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 ,D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) which allows us to select a BB sample with a purity of 96% and with B sig and B tag daughters properly assigned to the parent particles. Figure 1 shows the M tag and \u2206E tag distributions of the control sample for data and the MC simulation scaled to the integrated luminosity in data. The events satisfy the B tag -selection criteria and are in the \u22120.25 GeV< \u2206E tag < 0.05 GeV (for Fig. 1(a)) and M tag >5.27 GeV/c 2 (for Fig. 1(b)) windows. The good agreement of the shapes and of the absolute normalization demonstrates the validity of the MC-simulations for B tag decays. Based on this study we constrain all further analysis to the region \u22120.25 GeV< \u2206E tag <0.05 GeV. With this requirement about 80% of the events are contained in the range M tag > 5.27 GeV/c 2 .

The systematic uncertainties in the signal yield arise from uncertainties in the signal and background shape and peaking background. The systematic error due to the statistical uncertainties in the CB shape is 2.8%. The CB parameters obtained from MC-samples are, within statistical errors, consistent with those extracted from fits to the control sample in data. Therefore we do not introduce additional uncertainties due to imperfect signal shape modeling. The systematic errors due to the parameterization of the combinatorial background are evaluated by changing the ARGUS-shape parameters by \u00b11\u03c3. Fits with the shape parameters allowed to float provide consistent results within statistical uncertainties. The total systematic uncertainty due to the combinatorial background parameterization is +5.7 \u221210.1 %. The systematic error due to the peaking background is evaluated for each channel and amounts to +8.2 \u22124.4 % for combined modes, which is dominated by MC statistics. The effective efficiency ij \u01eb ij B ij includes uncertainties in determination of the efficiencies for B tag reconstruction, (D * \u2212 e + /\u03c0 + ) pair selection and signal selection. The uncertainty in B tag reconstruction is taken as the statistical error in the B tag efficiency evaluated from the data control sample (tagged with B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03c0 + decay) and is 10.9%. The systematic error on the determination of (D * \u2212 e + /\u03c0 + ) pair selec-tion efficiency comes from systematic uncertainties in the tracking efficiency, neutral reconstruction efficiency and particle identification and is in the range 7.9%-10.7% depending on the decay chain. Systematic uncertainties in the signal selection efficiency are determined by comparing MC and data distributions in the variables used for signal selection. The uncertainties due to the partial branching ratios are taken from the errors quoted in the PDG [3]. All of the above sources of systematic uncertainties are combined together taking into account correlations between different decay chains. The combined systematic uncertainty is 18.5%.",
