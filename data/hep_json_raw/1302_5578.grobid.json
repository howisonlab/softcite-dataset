            "text": "For \u039b 0 b baryons originating from energetic b-quarks, heavyquark effective theory (HQET) predicts a large fraction of the transverse b-quark polarisation to be retained after hadronisation [1,2], while the longitudinal polarisation should vanish due to parity conservation in strong interactions. For \u039b 0 b baryons produced in e \u2212 e + \u2192 Z 0 \u2192 bb transitions, a substantial polarisation is measured [3][4][5], in agreement with the Z 0 bb coupling of the Standard Model (SM). There is no previous polarisation measurement for \u039b 0 b baryons produced at hadron colliders. The transverse polarisation is estimated to be O(10%) in Ref. [6] while Ref. [7] mentions it could be as large as 20%. However, for \u039b baryons produced in fixed-target experiments [8][9][10], the polarisation was observed to depend strongly on the Feynman variable",

The asymmetry of the \u039b decay (\u03b1 \u039b ) is much less precisely measured [12], however by neglecting possible CP violation effects, which are predicted to be very small in the SM [14,15], \u03b1 \u039b and \u2212\u03b1 \u039b can be assumed to \u2729 \u00a9 CERN for the benefit of the LHCb Collaboration.",

The systematic uncertainties are summarised in Table 3. They are dominated by the uncertainty arising from the acceptance function, the calibration of the simulated signal sample and the fit bias. The uncertainty related to the acceptance function is obtained by varying the coefficients of the Legendre function within their uncertainties and taking into account their correlations. For the calibration of our simulated data, the uncertainty is obtained when changing the (p T , y) calibrations of the \u039b 0 b , \u039b and pion particles within their uncertainties and obtaining a new acceptance function. The function that is used to fit the data does not include the effect of the angular resolution. The angular resolution, obtained with simulated samples, is negligible for \u03b8 and \u03b8 2 . However, it is large, up to \u223c 70%, for small values of \u03b8 1 . The systematic uncertainty is obtained by fitting simulated samples in which the resolution effect is introduced. Effects of the deviation from an uniform acceptance in \u03c6 1 and \u03c6 2 assumed in Eq. (1) are found to be negligible. The simplification to use only one component to describe the background is found not to bias the result. Other systematic uncertainties are small or negligible. These are related to the signal mass PDF parameters, the background subtraction and \u03b1 \u039b . The uncertainty related to the background subtraction are obtained when varying the obtained result of the mass fit and computing the w mass weights again.",

For P b and r 0 , the biases do not change significantly when changing the value of \u03b1 b used to generate the simulated samples. On the other hand, the biases on \u03b1 b and r 1 do change, and the observed discrepancies are treated as systematic uncertainties. Moreover, the statistical uncertainties on the four fit parameters are underestimated: again slightly for P b and r 0 and significantly, by a factor of \u223c 1.7, for \u03b1 b and r 1 .",
