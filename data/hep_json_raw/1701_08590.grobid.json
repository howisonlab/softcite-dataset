In this paper we analyze this annual modulation effect in terms of mirror Dark Matter, an exact duplicate of ordinary matter from parallel hidden sector, which chemical composition is dominated by mirror helium while it can also contain significant fractions of heavier elements as Carbon and Oxygen. Dark mirror atoms are considered to interact with the target nuclei in the detector via Rutherford-like scattering induced by kinetic mixing between mirror and ordinary photons, both being massless. In the present analysis we consider various possible scenarios for the mirror matter chemical composition. For all the scenarios, the relevant ranges for the kinetic mixing parameter have been obtained taking also into account various existing uncertainties in nuclear and particle physics quantities.",

By considering the data of the 7 a e-mail: rita.bernabei@roma2.infn.it annual cycles collected by DAMA/NaI experiment (concluded in 2002) and of the 7 annual cycles collected by DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 an exposure of 1.33 ton \u00d7 year has been released. The observed annual modulation effect points out the presence of DM particles in the Galactic halo at 9.3\u03c3 CL and the modulation amplitude of the singlehit events in the (2-6) keV energy interval is: (0.0112 \u00b1 0.0012) cpd/kg/keV; the measured phase is (144 \u00b1 7) days and the measured period is (0.998\u00b10.002) years, values well in agreement with those expected for DM particles [36]. No systematic effect or side reaction able to mimic the measured modulation effect, i.e. able to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude and simultaneously satisfy all of many peculiarities of the signature, was found or suggested by anyone over decades.",

The Lagrangians L and L can be made identical by imposing mirror parity, a discrete symmetry under the exchange G \u2194 G when all O particles (fermions, Higgses and gauge fields) exchange places with their M twins ('primed' fermions, Higgses and gauge fields). Mirror matter, invisible in terms of ordinary photons but gravitationally coupled to our matter, could make a part of cosmological DM. If mirror parity is an exact symmetry, then for all ordinary particles: the electron e, proton p, neutron n, photon \u03b3 , neutrinos \u03bd etc., with interactions described by the Standard Model SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), there should exist their mirror twins: e , p , n , \u03b3 , \u03bd etc. which are sterile to our strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions but have instead their own gauge interactions SU (3) \u00d7SU (2) \u00d7U (1) with exactly the same coupling constants. Thus, we need no new parameters for describing mirror physics: ordinary and mirror particles are degenerate in mass, and O and M sectors have identical microphysics at all levels from particle to atomic physics. In addition, the cosmological fraction of mirror baryons B should be related to the dark baryon asymmetry as the fraction of ordinary baryons B is related to our baryon asymmetry, and baryon asymmetries in two sectors should be related to the same baryogenesis mechanism.",

However, if one naively takes B = B , then M matter is not sufficient for explaining the whole amount of DM, and other type of DM should be introduced to obtain DM 5 B . On the other hand, if two sectors have the same temperature, T = T , this would strongly disagree with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limits on the effective amount of light degrees of freedom: the contribution of M particles in the universe expansion rate at the BBN epoch would be equivalent to the amount of extra neutrinos N eff = 6.15, while at most N eff 0.5 is allowed by the present constraints. In addition, due to self-interacting and dissipative nature of mirror baryons, T = T would be in full disagreement with the precision cosmological tests on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large scale structures (LSS) of the Universe, even if mirror baryons constitute a smaller fraction of cosmological DM, with B = B . 1 All these problems can be settled at once, if we assume that after inflation the two sectors were heated to different temperatures, and the temperature of the mirror sector T remained less than the ordinary one T over all stages of the cosmological evolution [63]. The condition T < T can be realized by adopting the following paradigm: at the end of inflation the O-and M-sectors are (re)heated in an non-symmetric way, with T > T , which can naturally occur in the context of certain inflationary models; the possible particle processes between O and M sectors should be slow enough and cannot bring two worlds into the equilibrium after the (re)heating, so that both systems evolve almost adiabatically and the temperature asymmetry T /T remains nearly invariant in all subsequent epochs until the present days. In this way Mirror matter, with its atoms having the same mass as the ordinary ones, could constitute a viable candidate for asymmetric Dark Matter despite its collisional and dissipative nature.",

Cosmological implications of M baryons The basic question is, how small the temperature ratio T /T should be, and, on the other hand, how large the ratio B / B between M and O baryon fractions can be, to make the concept of mirror matter cosmologically plausible. The BBN limits demand that T /T < 0.5 or so, which is equivalent to N eff = 0.5 [63]. The stronger limit T /T < 0.3 or so comes from cosmological considerations, by requiring the early enough decoupling of M photons which makes M baryons practically indistinguishable from the canonic Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in observational tests related to the large scale structure formation and CMB anisotropies [63][64][65][66][67]. The above limits apply independently whether M baryons constitute DM entirely, or only about 20% fraction of it, when B B [65,66]. In this case the remained 80% of DM should come from other component, presumably some sort of the CDM represented by particles belonging to the socalled WIMP class of DM candidates, by axion, or by other sort of hidden gauge sectors with heavier shadow baryons as in the case of asymmetric mirror matter [56][57][58], considered in our previous paper [47]. On the other hand, if DM is represented entirely by M baryons, i.e. B 5 B , then the requirement of the formation of the normal galaxies with masses larger than 10 9 M gives T /T < 0.2 or so while the power of smaller galaxies will be suppressed by Silk damping [63,64]. Hence, cosmological evolution of the density perturbations of M matter is compatible with the observed pattern of the cosmological large scale power spectrum and the CMB anisotropies if M sector is cold enough, T /T < 0.2 or so, while its collisional and dissipative nature can have specific observable implications for the evolution and formation of the structures at smaller scales, formation of galaxy halos and stars, etc. (for reviews, see e.g. [65,68,69]).",

Hence, M sector should be helium dominated. In particular, for T /T < 0.3, M world would have only 25% mass fraction of mirror hydrogen and 75% of mirror helium-4 [63], against the observed mass fractions of ordinary hydrogen (75%) and helium-4 (25%). In addition, M world can have also somewhat larger primordial metallicity than our sector. All this should have direct implications also for the formation and evolution of mirror stars [70] which produce also heavier mirror elements as oxygen, carbon etc. Future astrophysical and cosmological observations might accomplish a consistent picture of the mirror matter as Dark Matter.",

Once these processes violate also CP due to complex coupling constants, while their departure from equilibrium is already implied by the condition T < T , all three Sakharov's conditions can be naturally satisfied. In this way, these scenarios co-generate baryon asymmetries in both O and M sectors.

            "text": "B. Particle interactions between two sectors and oscillation phenomena A straightforward and experimentally direct way to establish existence of mirror matter is the experimental search for oscillation phenomena between ordinary and mirror particles. In fact, any neutral particle, elementary (as e.g. neutrino) or composite (as the neutron or hydrogen atom) can mix with its mass degenerate twin from the parallel sector leading to a matter disappearance (or appearance) phenomena which can be observable in laboratories. E.g., the kinetic mixing between ordinary and mirror photons [75] induces the positronium oscillation into mirror positronium which would imitate the invisible channel of the positronium decay [76,77]. The interactions mediated by heavy gauge bosons between particles of two sectors, which can have e.g. a common flavour gauge symmetry [78] or common gauge B \u2212 L symmetry [79] can induce mixing of neutral pions and Kaons with their mirror twins. The oscillation phenomena between ordinary (active) and mirror (sterile) neutrinos can have interesting observational consequences [60,80]. Interestingly, the present experimental bounds allow the neutron oscillation phenomena between two sectors to be rather fast [74], with interesting astrophysical and experimental implications [81][82][83][84][85][86]. In this respect, the relevant interaction terms between O and M particles are the ones which violate baryon B and lepton L numbers of both sectors and which can be at the origin of co-baryogenesis scenarios [65,[71][72][73][74].",

Interaction portals and direct detection Mirror matter can interact with ordinary matter via different portals in L mix , e.g. via kinetic mixing of M and O photons, or mass mixing of M and O pions or \u03c1-mesons, or via contact interaction terms 1 Mq \u03b3 \u03bc qq \u03b3 \u03bc q between O and M quarks which can be mediated by extra gauge bosons connecting two sectors [78]. In particular, there is not just one Dark Matter particle, as in most of well-motivated Dark Matter models, but it could consist of different atoms, from the primordial hydrogen and helium as dominant components, to reasonable fractions heavier elements as carbon, oxygen, etc. produced in mirror stars. The experimental direct searches of the particle DM should be concentrated on the detection of mirror helium as most abundant mirror atoms. In fact, the region of Dark Matter masses below 5 GeV is practically unexplored. In any case, for any realistic chemical composition of M sector, we know its mass spectrum of possible atomic/nuclear structures directly from our physical experience, with enormous empirical material available for ordinary atoms. Therefore, the only unknown in this puzzle is related to the interaction portal.",

In perfect out-of equilibrium conditions, when x = T /T 1 and so n \u03b3 /n \u03b3 x 3 1, this leptogenesis mechanism predicts n B = n B and thus B = B . In this case the cosmological fractions of ordinary and mirror baryons are equal, i.e. mirror matter can constitute only about 20% of Dark Matter in the Universe, and some other type of Dark Matter should be invoked for compelling the remaining 80%. However, if the out-of-equilibrium is not perfect, then generically final T /T increases and one has B / B > 1. Taking e.g. T /T < 0.2, cosmological limit at which mirror matter with B > B is still allowed by the CMB and large scale tests, we get an upper limit B / B < 5 or so.

There should exist two disks in the Milky Way (MW), one visible and another invisible and perhaps of different radius and thickness, with comparable amount of O and M components. It is known that the total surface density of matter in the MW disk at the region of the sun is about (68 \u00b1 4) M /pc 2 [90], while the ordinary matter can account for a fraction (38 \u00b1 4)M /pc 2 or so [90]. Therefore, the surface density of mirror matter can be (30 \u00b1 6)M /pc 2 , perfectly compatible for the presence of dark disk similar to ours in MW. In fact, this would not contradict to the shape of the rotational velocities if the dark mirror disk is somewhat more thick than ordinary disk, and the mirror bulge is more extended than ours.",

At first glance mirror matter, having the same microphysics as ordinary matter, cannot form extended galactic halos. However, this can be possible if mirror stars are formed earlier than ordinary stars, and before the mirror matter collapsed into the disk. 2 However, one has to take into account the possibility that in the galaxy evolution dissipative M matter, during its cooling and contraction fragments into molecular clouds in which cool rapidly and form the stars. Star formation, and moreover of the first stars, is a difficult question, however, by formal Jeans criteria, in M matter which is cooler and also helium dominated, the Jeans mass is smaller and star formation could be more efficient. In this way, mirror matter forming the stars could form, during the collapse, dark elliptical galaxies, perfectly imitating halos, while some part of survived gas could form also a dark mirror disk. In other words, we speculate on the possibility that due to faster star formation M baryons mainly form elliptical galaxies. For comparison, in MW less than one per mille of mass is contained in globular clusters and halo stars which were formed before disk formation. In MW there are up to 200 globular clusters orbiting in the Galaxy halo at distances of 50 kpc while some giant elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters can have as many as 10 4 globular clusters containing the overall mass \u223c10 9 \u221210 10 M . In mirror sector, if fragmentation in molecular clouds and stars is more efficient, stars are smaller and evolving faster, the elliptical galaxy can be formed by mirror stars in which ordinary matter goes mainly into disk (and also faster stellar evolution is important.) It is also possible that the mass function and chemical composition of these stars is balanced so that many of them could form black holes with masses 10\u221230 M , and among those binary black holes. This can be interesting also in view of the recent publication about gravitational wave signals from such a heavy black holes in the galaxies [94,95]. Also this can have implications for central black hole formation [63].",

In principle, the mirror disk can be co-rotating or counter-rotating with respect to ordinary disk, while the mirror gas at the present locality of the sun in the Galaxy can exist in the same forms that we know for the ordinary interstellar gas. Namely, it can be present in the form varying from cold molecular cloud, with temperatures T \u223c 10 K, to warm neutral medium with T \u223c 10 4 K and hot ionized medium with T \u223c 10 7 K. This medium can have a local peculiar flow velocity in the galactic frame which can be dependent on the galactic coordinates and can have a value of few hundreds of km/s and certain orientation with respect to sun's velocity. In addition, in the rest frame of this medium the mirror particles will have thermal velocities which will be dependent on the particle mass. In this case the angle \u03b1 between the Sun velocity and the local peculiar flow velocity can be tested by the phase of the experimental signal in a way independent on the thermal distribution velocity. In the following we consider situations with different benchmark values of the local peculiar flow velocity and of the thermal velocities. In view that mirror Dark Matter is supposed to be multi-component, consisting of not only hydrogen and helium but containing also some significant amount of heavier mirror atoms, the dependence of thermal velocity on the particle mass makes the predictions different from the CDM case when dark particles would have the same pseudo-Maxwellian velocity distribution independent on their masses. Chemical composition of mirror matter As far as at the mirror BBN epoch the universe expansion rate is dominated by O matter density, the weak interaction's freezing in M sector occurs earlier and frozen ratio of neutrons to protons is larger than in O nucleosynthesis. As a result, primordial chemical content of M sector is helium dominated, with 4 He constituting up to 80% of mass fraction of M baryons in the limit T /T \u2192 0 [63]. In the following we take mirror helium-4 benchmark mass fraction as 75%, and mirror hydrogen as 25%. The primordial chemical content in mirror sector should also have larger metallicity that in ordinary one, but the primordial mass fraction of the heavier elements is anyway negligible.",

In O sector, the chemical elements with A \u223c 16 as Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Neon account for about a per cent of mass fraction, while heavier elements are less abundant, accounting in whole for about 4 per mille of mass fraction. In mirror sector, these proportions can be quite different. One can imagine one extreme possibility that mirror stars are typically light and do not end up as supernovae, or the gravitational collapse of heavier mirror stars typically leads to black hole formation rather than to supernova at the final stage. In this case the chemical content of mirror gas will be essentially the same as the primordial content. i.e. dominated by helium and hydrogen. On the other extreme, one can imagine that the star formation in M sector can be more efficient, including the heavier stars with mass >10 M . As it was studied in Ref. [70], the evolution of the latter is at least an order of magnitude faster than for ordinary heavy stars, they can produce many supernovae and so the heavier elements in M sector could be more abundant than in ordinary sector. We assign to the mirror atoms a cosmological abundances directly rescaled from the abundances in ordinary sector (for reference, Table 1 shows the benchmark values for mass and atom fractions of different elements in the solar system).

In this modeling a dark halo, at the present epoch, is crossing a region close to the Sun with a velocity in the Galactic frame that could be, in principle, arbitrary. Hereafter we will refer to such local bubbles simply as halo. The halo can be composed by different species of mirror DM particles (different mirror atoms) that have been thermalized and in a frame at rest with the halo. They have a velocity distribution that can be considered Maxwellian with the characteristic velocity related to the temperature of the halo and to the mass of the mirror atoms. We assume that the halo has its own local equilibrium temperature, T , and the velocity parameter of the A mirror atoms is given by \u221a 2k B T /M A . In this scenario lighter mirror atoms have bigger velocities than the heavier ones, on the contrary of the CDM model where the velocity distribution is mass independent. If we extrapolate this assumption for electrons, in the case of hot ionized plasma with T \u223c 1 keV, electron recoils due to elastic scattering of mirror electrons and ordinary electrons could also be relevant. In this case even some reasonable fraction of hot ionized mirror medium could give a contribution to the signal in the detector.

This effect can lead to an important deviation, in addition to the other uncertainties discussed in section II of Ref. [37] and in Ref. [47]. In fact, the channeling effect in crystals implies that a fraction of nuclear recoils are channeled and experience much larger quenching factors than those derived from neutron calibration (see [19,37] for a discussion of these aspects). The channeling effect in solid crystal detectors is not a well fixed issue. There are a lot of uncertainties in the modeling. Moreover, the experimental approaches (as that in Ref. [111]) are rather difficult since the channelled nuclear recoils are -even in the most optimistic model -a very tiny fraction of the not-channeled recoils. In particular, the modeling of the channeling effect described by DAMA in Ref. [19] is able to reproduce the recoil spectrum measured at neutron beam by some other groups (see Ref. [19] for details). For completeness, we mention the alternative channeling model of Ref. [112], where larger probabilities of the planar channeling are expected, and the analytic calculation where the channeling effect holds for recoils coming from outside a crystal and not from recoils from lattice sites, due to the blocking effect [113]. Nevertheless, although some amount of blocking effect could be present, the precise description of the crystal lattice with dopant and trace contaminants is quite difficult and analytical calculations require some simplifications which can affect the result. Because of the difficulties of experimental measurements and of theoretical estimate of the channeling effect, in the following it will be either included using the procedure given in Ref. [19] or not in order to give idea on the related uncertainty.",

The first case (set A) considers the mean values of the parameters of the used nuclear form factors [14] and of the quenching factors. The set B adopts the same procedure as in Refs. [9,10], by varying (i) the mean values of the 23 Na and 127 I quenching factors as measured in Ref.

For each scenario the different halo compositions reported in Table 2 have been considered, with halo temperature in the range 10 4 \u221210 8 K and with halo velocity from \u2212400 to +300 km/s. The uncertainties, described in the three sets given in Sect. 4.4, have been considered. Firstly we show in Fig. 4 the behaviour of the modulated part, S m of the Dark Matter signal obtained by fitting the considered DM mirror model with the DAMA annual modulation data. Two composite halo models (left: H (12.5%), He (75%), C (7%), O (5.5%), right: H (20%), He (74%), C (0.9%), O (5%), Fe (0.1%)) having different temperatures in different frameworks have been considered as examples. The contribution to the signal coming from each mirror atom species are reported. In both case the most relevant contribution comes from the O dark atoms while the contribution of the H is negligible. It is interesting to note that the profile of the modulated signal below 2 keV is different for the two halo models; this can be studied by DAMA/LIBRA, now running in its phase2 with a software energy threshold down to 1 keV.",

As it can be expected, considering for example the behaviour of unmodulated part of the dark atom signal depicted in Fig. 3, the allowed regions -in all the considered scenarios -move toward lower value of \u221a f parameter when the dark atoms of the halo are heavier with higher charge numbers; in this case the interaction cross section increases and, in order to keep the same strength of the DM signal, lower value of coupling are preferred. The lowest allowed regions is obtained for a pure Fe' halo. For each scenario there are two regimes: for cold halo the allowed \u221a f parameter increases with the halo velocity while the parameter converges to a lower value for hot halo regardless its velocity in the Galactic frame. In cold scenario the dark atoms kinetic energy in the halo is small and the relative velocity of the halo with respect to the Earth is the dominant contribution to the average velocity of the particles in the laboratory frame. Thus, for large positive halo velocity the kinetic energy of the dark atoms in the laboratory frame is small and, to have recoils with sufficient energy to fit the DAMA signal, large value of \u221a f parameter are favoured. On the contrary, when the velocity of the halo is opposite to the Earth motion, the kinetic energy of the dark atoms in the laboratory increases and lower \u221a f values are favoured. In hot scenario, the velocity of the dark atoms in the halo is high and it becomes the dominant contribution to the velocity of the particles in the laboratory frame. In this regime the allowed \u221a f parameters converge to lower values for any halo velocity. When the velocity of the halo is high and opposite to the Earth, its contribution to the kinetic energy of the dark atoms in the laboratory frame is dominant with respect to the velocity distribution of the particles in the halo. In this case the allowed \u221a f parameters is independent on the temperature of the halo. In the case of a pure Fe' halo there are no allowed region for negative halo velocity. In fact, the coupling of the Fe' mirror atoms with ordinary matter is high and the expected signal in case of a particle with high kinetic energy is too large to fit the DAMA observed annual modulation effect.",

As it can be noted in Figs. 12 and 13 the allowed regions have a clear dependence on the chosen scenario for the response of the detector (as in Table 3) The three contours in each plot correspond to: set C (area with horizontal lines) (green area on-line), set A (area with diagonal lines) (gray area on-line), set B (shaded area) (red area on-line), respectively. The results obtained by considering the different sets of the parameters can be compared narios with a better response at low energy, such e.g. the scenario (b), favour smaller values of \u221a f . The uncertainties on the Galactic local velocity, once the halo temperature is fixed, play a role only for positive halo velocities larger than about 100 km/s (see for example Fig. 14). The uncertainties on the parameters used in the nuclear form factors (the three different set A, B and C) have smaller impacts on the allowed regions. Finally, it is worth noting that many configurations exist that are well compatible with cosmological bounds. Obviously, introduction of other uncertainties and modelling is expected to further enlarge the allowed regions.",

In the analysis we have assumed that a fraction f of the DM halo in the Galaxy is composed by mirror atoms of various species and we have derived allowed physical intervals for the parameters \u221a f , in various halo models. We have also accounted for some of the possible existing uncertainties. The results demonstrate that many configurations and halo models favoured by the annual modulation effect observed by DAMA corresponds to \u221a f values well compatible with cosmological bounds.",
