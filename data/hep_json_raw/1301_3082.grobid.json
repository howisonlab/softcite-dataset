For this reason the detector was designed to operate at a reduced luminosity. The luminosity at LHCb is locally controlled by transverse displacement of the beams (so-called \"levelling\") to yield L = 4 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 (approximately a factor of two above the original LHCb design value) at which the average event pile-up per visible crossing is \u223c2.

As a consequence, the bb pair is boosted along the direction of the higher momentum gluon, and both b hadrons are produced in the same forward (or backward) direction in the pp centre-of-mass frame. The detector is therefore designed as a singlearm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, which ensures a high geometric efficiency for detecting all the decay particles from one b hadron together with decay products from the accompanying b hadron to be used as a flavour tag. The key detector features are a versatile trigger scheme efficient for both leptonic and hadronic final states, which is able to cope with a variety of modes with small branching fractions; excellent vertex and proper time resolution; precise particle identification, specifically for hadron (\u03c0/K) separation; precise invariant mass reconstruction to reject background efficiently. A full description of the detector characteristics can be found in Ref. [1].",

The CDF and D0 collaborations [4,5] have reported measurements of the B s mixing phase based on approximately 11,000 B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 candidates from an integrated luminosity of 9.6 fb \u22121 (i.e. the full CDF Run II dataset) and 6,500 B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 candidates from 8 fb \u22121 , respectively.

Besides having a very large and clean signal yield, LHCb also benefits from an excellent proper time resolution to resolve fast B s oscillations, which is measured to be \u223c45 fs, compared to a B s oscillation period of \u223c350 fs. The other key experimental ingredient is flavour tagging, which is performed by reconstructing the charge of the b-hadron accompanying the B meson under study. The analysis uses an opposite-side flavour tagger based on four different signatures, namely high p T muons, electrons and kaons, and the net charge of an inclusively reconstructed secondary vertex, with a combined effective tagging power of \u223c2.4%. The decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 is a pseudoscalar to vector-vector transition. Total angular momentum conservation implies l = 0, 1, 2 and therefore the J/\u03c8\u03c6 final state is a mixture of CP-even (l = 0, 2) and CP-odd (l = 1) eigenstates, which can be disentangled on a statistical basis. This is accomplished by performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the candidate invariant mass, decay time, initial B s flavour and the decay angles in the so-called transversity frame [7]. The fit yields the following result for the three main observables, namely \u03c6 s , the decay width, \u0393 s , and the decay width difference between the light and heavy B s mass eigenstates, \u2206\u0393 s \u03c6 s = \u22120.001 \u00b1 0.101(stat) \u00b1 0.027(syst) rad, \u0393 s = 0.6580 \u00b1 0.0054(stat) \u00b1 0.0066(syst) ps \u22121 ,",

These results are fully consistent with the SM, indicating that CP violation in the B s system is small. Actually, there exists a second mirror solution in the plane \u2206\u0393 s vs \u03c6 s , which arises from the fact that the timedependent differential decay rates are invariant under the transformation (\u03c6 s , \u2206\u0393 s ) \u2192 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6 s , \u2212\u2206\u0393 s ) (plus an appropriate transformation of the strong phases). LHCb has recently resolved this ambiguity [8] by studying the dependence of the strong phase difference between the S -wave and P-wave amplitudes on the K + K \u2212 mass from B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 decays in the region around the \u03c6(1020) resonance. The solution with positive \u2206\u0393 s is favoured with a significance of 4.7 standard deviations, indicating that in the B s system the lighter CP mass eigenstate that is almost CP even decays faster than the state that is almost CP odd.",

            "text": "One of the most powerful ways to measure the angle \u03b3 is through charged B decays to open charm, B \u00b1 \u2192 Dh \u00b1 , where D stands for a D 0 or a D 0 and h indicates either a pion or kaon. Decays in which the hadron h is a kaon carry greater sensitivity to \u03b3. The method is based on two key observations: 1. These decays can produce neutral D mesons of both flavours via colourfavoured or colour-suppressed decays 2. Neutral D and D mesons can decay to a common final state, for example through Cabibbo-favoured or doubly Cabibbosuppressed Feynman diagrams (ADS method [13]) or through decays to CP eigenstates such as K + K \u2212 or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (GLW method [14]). In the ADS case, the reversed suppression between B and D decays results in very similar amplitudes leading to a high sensitivity to \u03b3. The relative phase between the two interfering amplitudes for B + \u2192 DK + and B + \u2192 DK + is the sum of the strong and weak interaction phases, while in the case of B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 and B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 it is the difference between the strong phase and \u03b3. Therefore both phases can be extracted by measuring the two charge conjugate modes. In addition, there is a dependence on the ratio between the magnitude of the suppressed amplitude and the favoured amplitude r B .",

In particular, NP may show up as virtual contributions of new particles in loop diagrams. A comparison of results from decays dominated by tree-level diagrams with those that start at loop level can probe the validity of the SM. In particular, it was pointed out by Fleischer [20] that U-spin related decays (obtained by interchanging d and s quarks) of the type B s,d \u2192 h + h \u2212 , with h, h = \u03c0, K, offer interesting strategies for the measurement of the angle \u03b3: in presence of NP in the penguin loops, such a determination could differ appreciably from that derived from B LHCb has analysed very large samples of B s,d \u2192 h + h \u2212 decays, separating the final state pions and kaons by using the particle identification provided by the RICH detectors. Figure 3 shows the invariant K\u03c0 mass spectra for B s,d \u2192 K\u03c0 events based on an integrated luminosity of 0.35 fb \u22121 [21]. The selection cuts are optimised for the best sensitivity to A CP (B d \u2192 K\u03c0) (plots a and b) and A CP (B s \u2192 K\u03c0) (plots c and d), where the CP asymmetry in the B decay rate to the final state f = K\u03c0 is defined as A CP = (\u0393(B\u2192 f )\u2212\u0393(B\u2192 f ) (\u0393(B\u2192 f )+\u0393(B\u2192 f ) . LHCb reported [21] the most precise measurement for A CP (B d \u2192 K\u03c0) available to date, with a significance exceeding 6 \u03c3, as well as the first evidence, at the 3.3 \u03c3 level, for CP violation in the decay of the B s mesons. The effect of the CP asymmetry is visible in Fig. 3 by comparing the yields for the B d \u2192 K\u03c0 in (a) and (b) and those for the B s \u2192 K\u03c0 in (c) and (d).",

The flavour of the charm meson is determined by requiring a D * \u00b1 \u2192 (D 0 \u2192 h + h \u2212 ) \u03c0 \u00b1 s decay, with h = \u03c0 or K, in which the sign of the slow pion \u03c0 s tags the initial D 0 or D 0 . By taking the difference of the measured time-integrated asymmetries for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 , effects related to the D * production asymmetry and to the detection asymmetry of the slow pion and D meson in the final state cancel to first order, so that one can derive the difference of the CP asymmetries, \u2206A CP . Second-order effects are minimised by performing the analysis in bins of the relevant kinematic variables. A nice additional advantage of taking this difference is that in the U-spin limit A CP (KK) = \u2212A CP (\u03c0\u03c0) for any direct CP violation [25], so that the effect is amplified. The final result is",

In the B 0 s system LHCb has obtained the world's most precise measurement of the mixing phase \u03c6 s and the first direct observation for a non-zero value for \u2206\u0393 s . Important milestones have been reached in the measurement of the weak phase \u03b3 both from decays at tree level and from those where new physics could contribute through loops. The large charm production cross-section at the LHC has allowed for a dramatic improvement in sensitivity to CP violating effects. During the 2012 run at \u221a s = 8 TeV, another 2.1fb \u22121 of data were collected, which will allow LHCb to increase the precision on the results presented here and pursue new analyses to understand precisely the nature of CP violation in charm and beauty and hopefully find signs of new physics.",
