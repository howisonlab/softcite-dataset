Analyzing data from PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV, recorded with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, parton energy loss is observed as a significant imbalance of dijet transverse momentum. To gain further understanding of the parton energy loss mechanism and how it manifests itself in the distribution of final state particles, fragmentation functions are studied for the leading and subleading jet in bins of dijet imbalance.",

Recent results on PbPb collisions from CMS [2] and ATLAS [3] experiments have shown that dijets become increasingly imbalanced with event centrality; and the CMS results have highlighted that most of the quenched energy is transferred out of the jet cone which suggests that the reconstructed jet represents the fragments of the parton after quenching. In this study [4] we investigate to what extent the fragmentation pattern of the remnant parton resembles vacuum fragmentation.",

In addition to the smearing, the pp reference is reweighted such that the final jet spectrum matches that of the PbPb events.
