            "text": "The standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles and their interactions via the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson (B 0 s ) and the B 0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (m 1 and m 2 ) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the B 0 s ?m 1 m 2 and B 0 ?m 1 m 2 decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion B 0 s mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B 0 mesons 1 . A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN 2 started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton-proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-ofmass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report the first observation of the B 0 s ? m 1 m 2 decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the B 0 ? m 1 m 2 decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model. The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will approximately double the production rates of B 0 s and B 0 mesons and lead to further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard model.",

Theoretical developments have kept pace by improving the accuracy of the SM predictions as the experimental results gained in precision. In the course of the past few decades, the SM has passed critical tests derived from experiment, but it does not address some profound questions about the nature of the Universe. For example, the existence of dark matter, which has been confirmed by cosmological data 3 , is not accommodated by the SM. It also fails to explain the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter, which after the Big Bang led to the survival of the tiny amount of matter currently present in the Universe 3,4 . Many theories have been proposed to modify the SM to provide solutions to these open questions.",

However, it is possible to respect this rule and still have this decay occur through 'higher order' transitions such as those shown in Fig. 1d and e. These are highly suppressed because each additional interaction vertex reduces their probability of occurring significantly. They are also helicity and CKM suppressed. Consequently, the branching fraction for the B 0 s ?m z m { decay is expected to be very small compared to the dominant b antiquark to c antiquark transitions.

Both CMS and LHCb later published results from all data collected in proton-proton collisions at centre-ofmass energies of 7 TeV in 2011 and 8 TeV in 2012. The measurements had comparable precision and were in good agreement 18,19 , although neither of the individual results had sufficient precision to constitute the first definitive observation of the B 0 s decay to two muons. In this Letter, the two sets of data are combined and analysed simultaneously to exploit fully the statistical power of the data and to account for the main correlations between them. The data correspond to total integrated luminosities of 25 fb 21 and 3 fb 21 for the CMS and LHCb experiments, respectively, equivalent to a total of approximately 10 12 B 0 s and B 0 mesons produced in the two experiments together. Assuming the branching fractions given by the SM and accounting for the detection efficiencies, the predicted numbers of decays to be observed in the two experiments together are about 100 for B 0 s ?m z m { and 10 for B 0 R m 1 m 2 . The CMS 20 and LHCb 21 detectors are designed to measure SM phenomena with high precision and search for possible deviations. The two collaborations use different and complementary strategies. In addition to performing a broad range of precision tests of the SM and studying the newly-discovered Higgs boson 22,23 , CMS is designed to search for and study new particles with masses from about 100 GeV/c 2 to a few TeV/c 2 . Since many of these new particles would be able to decay into b quarks and many of the SM measurements also involve b quarks, the detection of b-hadron decays was a key element in the design of CMS. The LHCb collaboration has optimized its detector to study matter-antimatter asymmetries and rare decays of particles containing b quarks, aiming to detect deviations from precise SM predictions that would indicate BSM effects. These different approaches, reflected in the design of the detectors, lead to instrumentation of complementary angular regions with respect to the LHC beams, to operation at different proton-proton collision rates, and to selection of b quark events with different efficiency (for experimental details, see Methods). In general, CMS operates at a higher instantaneous luminosity than LHCb but has a lower efficiency for reconstructing low-mass particles, resulting in a similar sensitivity to LHCb for B 0 or B 0 s (denoted hereafter by B 0 (s) ) mesons decaying into two muons.",

Both experiments evaluated many variables for their discriminating power and each chose the best set of about ten to be used in its respective BDT. These include variables related to the quality of the reconstructed tracks of the muons; kinematic variables such as transverse momentum (with respect to the beam axis) of the individual muons and of the B 0 (s) candidate; variables related to the decay vertex topology and fit quality, such as candidate decay length; and isolation variables, which measure the activity in terms of other particles in the vicinity of the two muons or their displaced vertex. A BDT must be 'trained' on collections of known background and signal events to generate the selection requirements on the variables and the weights for each tree. In the case of CMS, the background events used in the training are taken from intervals of dimuon mass above and below the signal region in data, while simulated events are used for the signal.

The invariant mass of the reconstructed dimuon candidate for these processes (semi-leptonic background) is usually smaller than the mass of the B 0 s or B 0 meson because the neutrino or another particle is not detected. There is also a background component from hadronic two-body B 0 (s) decays (peaking background) as B 0 R K 1 p 2 , when both hadrons from the decay are misidentified as muons. These misidentified decays can produce peaks in the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum near the expected signal, especially for the B 0 R m 1 m 2 decay. Particle identification algorithms are used to minimize the probability that pions and kaons are misidentified as muons, and thus suppress these background sources. Excellent mass resolution is mandatory for distinguishing between B 0 and B 0 s mesons with a mass difference of about 87 MeV/c 2 and for separating them from backgrounds. The mass resolution for B 0 s ?m z m { decays in CMS ranges from 32 to 75 MeV/c 2 , depending on the direction of the muons relative to the beam axis, while LHCb achieves a uniform mass resolution of about 25 MeV/c 2 .",

The CMS detector 20 , shown in Extended Data Fig. 3, is optimized to search for yet unknown heavy particles, with masses ranging from 100 GeV/c 2 to a few TeV/c 2 , which, if observed, would be a direct manifestation of BSM phenomena. Since many of the hypothesized new particles can decay into particles containing b quarks or into muons, CMS is able to detect efficiently and study B 0 (5,280 MeV/c 2 ) and B 0 s (5,367 MeV/c 2 ) mesons decaying to two muons even though it is designed to search for particles with much larger masses. The CMS detector covers a very large range of angles and momenta to reconstruct high-mass states efficiently. To that extent, it employs a 13 m long, 6 m diameter superconducting solenoid magnet, operated at a field of 3.8 T, centred on the IP with its axis along the beam direction and covering both hemispheres. A series of silicon tracking layers, consisting of silicon pixel detectors near the beam and silicon strips farther out, organized in concentric cylinders around the beam, extending to a radius of 1.1 m and terminated on each end by planar detectors (disks) perpendicular to the beam, measures the momentum, angles, and position of charged particles emerging from the collisions. Tracking coverage starts from the direction perpendicular to the beam and extends to within 220 mrad from it on both sides of the IP. The inner three cylinders and disks extending from 4.3 to 10.7 cm in radius transverse to the beam are arrays of 100 3 150 mm 2 silicon pixels, which can distinguish the displacement of the b-hadron decays from the primary vertex of the collision. The silicon strips, covering radii from 25 cm to approximately 110 cm, have pitches ranging from 80 to 183 mm. The impact parameter is measured with a precision of 10 mm for transverse momenta of 100 GeV/c and 20 mm for 10 GeV/c. The momentum resolution, provided mainly by the silicon strips, changes with the angle relative to the beam direction, resulting in a mass resolution for B 0 (s) ?m z m { decays that varies from 32 MeV/c 2 for B 0 (s) mesons produced perpendicularly to the proton beams to 75 MeV/c 2 for those produced at small angles relative to the beam direction. After the tracking system, at a greater distance from the IP, there is a calorimeter that stops (absorbs) all particles except muons and measures their energies. The calorimeter consists of an electromagnetic section followed by a hadronic section. Muons are identified by their ability to penetrate the calorimeter and the steel return yoke of the solenoid magnet and to produce signals in gas-ionization particle detectors located in compartments within the steel yoke. The CMS detector has no capability to discriminate between charged hadron species, pions, kaons, or protons, that is effective at the typical particle momenta in this analysis.",

LHCb aims at detecting BSM particles indirectly by measuring their effect on b-hadron properties for which precise SM predictions exist. The production cross section of b hadrons at the LHC is particularly large at small angles relative to the colliding beams. The small-angle region also provides advantages for the detection and reconstruction of a wide range of their decays. The LHCb experiment 21 , shown in Extended Data Fig. 4, instruments the angular interval from 10 to 300 mrad with respect to the beam direction on one side of the interaction region. Its detectors are designed to reconstruct efficiently a wide range of b-hadron decays, resulting in charged pions and kaons, protons, muons, electrons, and photons in the final state. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon strip vertex detector, a large-area silicon strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet characterized by a field integral of 4 T m, and three stations of silicon strip detectors and straw drift tubes downstream of the magnet. The vertex detector has sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish the slight displacement of the weakly decaying b hadron from the primary production vertex where the two protons collided and produced it. The tracking detectors upstream and downstream of the dipole magnet measure the momenta of charged particles. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with an uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. This results in an invariant-mass resolution of 25 MeV/c 2 for B 0 (s) mesons decaying to two muons that is nearly independent of the angle with respect to the beam. The impact parameter resolution is smaller than 20 mm for particle tracks with large transverse momentum. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by calorimeters. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

Since most of the interactions are reasonably well characterized (and can be further studied by recording only a small sample of them) specific event filters (known as triggers) select the rare processes that are of interest to the experiments. Both CMS and LHCb implement triggers that specifically select events containing two muons. The triggers of both experiments have a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, consisting of a large computing cluster that uses all the information from the detector, including the tracking, to make the final selection of events to be recorded for subsequent analysis. Since CMS is designed to look for much heavier objects than B 0 (s) mesons, it selects events that contain muons with higher transverse momenta than those selected by LHCb. This eliminates many of the B 0 (s) decays while permitting CMS to run at a higher proton-proton collision rate to look for the more rare massive particles. Thus CMS runs at higher collision rates but with lower efficiency than LHCb for B 0 \u00f0s\u00de mesons decaying to two muons.

In addition to the combinatorial background, certain specific b-hadron decays can mimic the signal or contribute to the background in its vicinity. In particular, the semi-leptonic decays B 0 R p 2 m 1 n, B 0 s R K 2 m 1 n, and L 0 b ?pm { n can have reconstructed masses that are near the signal if one of the hadrons is misidentified as a muon and is combined with a genuine muon.

Furthermore, background due to misidentified hadronic two-body decays B 0 (s) ?h z h' { , where h (0)~p or K, is present when both hadrons are misidentified as muons.

However, the B 0 and B 0 s particles are known to oscillate, that is to transform continuously into their antiparticles and vice versa. Therefore, a quantum superposition of particle and antiparticle states propagates in the laboratory before decaying. This superposition can be described by two 'mass eigenstates', which are symmetric and antisymmetric in the chargeparity (CP) quantum number, and have slightly different masses. In the SM, the heavy eigenstate can decay into two muons, whereas the light eigenstate cannot without violating the CP quantum number conservation. In BSM models, this is not necessarily the case. In addition to their masses, the two eigenstates of the B 0 s system also differ in their lifetime values 14 . The lifetimes of the light and heavy eigenstates are also different from the average B 0 s lifetime, which is used by CMS and LHCb in the simulations of signal decays. Since the information on the displacement of the secondary decay with respect to the PV is used as a discriminant against combinatorial background in the analysis, the efficiency versus lifetime has a model-dependent bias 62 that must be removed. This bias is estimated assuming SM dynamics. Owing to the smaller difference between the lifetime of its heavy and light mass eigenstates, no correction is required for the B 0 decay mode.",

The mean and standard deviation of these distributions are set to the central value and uncertainty obtained either from other measurements or from control channels. The statistical component of the final uncertainty on the branching fractions is obtained by repeating the fit after fixing all of the constrained nuisance parameters to their best fitted values.
