The calculation of the b \u2192 ssd amplitude results in branching fractions of at most O(10 \u221211 ), the exact value depending on the unknown relative phase between t and c quark contributions in the W \u00b1 -exchange box [3], as shown in Fig. 1. The magnitude of the b \u2192 dds amplitude is expected to be even smaller due to the relative |V td /V ts | factor, leading to predicted branching fractions of O(10 \u221214 ) [4].",

            "text": "Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) could result in enhanced branching fractions that can be detected at current experiments. Theoretical models that have been investigated include the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with and without R-Parity Violation, variations of the two Higgs doublet model, and extensions of the SM where an additional flavour changing Z neutral boson is present [3,4]. In these SM extensions, for certain plausible values of the model parameters, b \u2192 ssd and b \u2192 dds transitions may lead to branching fractions of up to 10 \u22128 and 10 \u22127 , respectively. It has been suggested by these theoretical studies that the most suitable three-body decay modes to see the effects of BSM physics in such transitions are the B + \u2192 K + K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + K \u2212 decays, where two particles in the final state have the same flavour and charge. 1 An upper limit of 1.29 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 90% confidence level on the branching fraction for the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + K \u2212 decay was first determined by OPAL [5]. Improvements in sensitivity were obtained by the e + e \u2212 B-factories, and currently the 90% confidence level upper limits for B + \u2192 K + K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + K \u2212 decays are 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , respectively [6][7][8]. 1 The inclusion of charge-conjugate decays is implied throughout. This paper reports on the search for the suppressed decays B + \u2192 K + K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + K \u2212 using data samples corresponding to 1.0 and 2.0 fb \u22121 collected by LHCb at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The corresponding unsuppressed decays B + \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + are used for normalisation.",

The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data-taking. The configuration with the magnetic field vertically upwards (downwards) bends positively (negatively) charged particles in the horizontal plane towards the centre of the LHC. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c.
