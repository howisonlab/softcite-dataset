            "text": "The measurement of the top quark-antiquark pair (tt) cross section provides a test of the hadroproduction of top quark pairs as predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). At the CERN LHC, measurements have been performed in many different decay channels and at three different proton-proton collision energies . Precision measurements of these cross sections allow for a test of their energy dependence as predicted by QCD; they can also place constrains on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) [25]. In combination with some theory, they also provide unambiguous measurements of interesting quantities, such as the top quark pole mass [13,21], which is difficult to determine by other means. A detailed understanding of the production cross section is also required in searches for evidence of new physics beyond the standard model, as tt production is often the dominant background process. This is especially important if the signature for the new physics is similar to that of tt production [13,26]. This paper presents a measurement of the tt production cross section (\u03c3 tt ) in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 decay channel using an event-counting method, based on observed yields. The analysis follows closely [12], and uses the full data set recorded by CMS at 13 TeV during 2015, which corresponds e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . This represents a factor of 50 increase in the amount of data over the original analysis and allows for more detailed studies of the experimental and theory uncertainties.",

            "text": "A measurement of the tt production cross section in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV is presented for events containing an oppositely charged electron-muon pair, and two or more jets, of which at least one is tagged as originating from a b quark. The measurement is performed through an event-counting method based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The measured cross section is \u03c3 tt = 815 \u00b1 9 (stat) \u00b1 38 (syst) \u00b1 19 (lumi) pb, with a total relative uncertainty of 5.3%. The measurement, that supersedes [12], is consistent with recent measurements from the ATLAS [24] and CMS [12] experiments and with the standard model prediction of \u03c3 tt = 832 +40 \u221246 pb for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the computing centres and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses. Finally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: BMWFW and FWF   ",
