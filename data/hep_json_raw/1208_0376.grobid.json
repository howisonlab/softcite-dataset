We measure branching fractions of (2.31 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and (1.60 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b1 0.22) \u00d7 10 \u22125 for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03c4 decays, respectively. We find no evidence for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03c4 decays and place upper limits on the branching fractions of 6.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at the 90% confidence level. The \u03c4 lepton can be used as a high-precision probe of the Standard Model (SM) and models of new physics. A recent BABAR paper, for example, presented a search for CP violation by measuring the decay-rate asymmetry of \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S \u03bd \u03c4 decays [1]. One of the backgrounds in that analysis is \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03bd \u03c4 , which has a large uncertainty in the branching fraction [2]. The uncertainty in the background from \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K 0 S K 0 S \u03bd \u03c4 decays was not a limitation of the decay-rate asymmetry measurement, but an improved measurement of the branching fraction and an understanding of the decay dynamics will be required for a future measurement at a high-luminosity Bfactory. * Now at the University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia \u2020 Also with Universit\u00e0 di Perugia, Dipartimento di Fisica, Perugia, Italy \u2021 Now at the University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK \u00a7 Deceased \u00b6 Now at University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA * * Also with Universit\u00e0 di Sassari, Sassari, Italy",

The BABAR detector is described in detail in Ref. [5]. In particular, charged particle momenta are measured with a five-layer double-sided silicon vertex tracker and a 40-layer drift chamber, both within a 1.5 T superconducting solenoidal magnet. Charged kaons and pions are separated by ionization (dE/dx) measurements in the silicon vertex detector and the drift chamber in combination with an internally reflecting Cherenkov detector. An electromagnetic calorimeter made of thallium-doped cesium iodide crystals provides energy measurements for electrons and photons, and an instrumented flux return detector identifies muons. Based on an integrated luminosity of 468 fb \u22121 , the data sample contains approximately 430 million \u03c4 -pair events.",
