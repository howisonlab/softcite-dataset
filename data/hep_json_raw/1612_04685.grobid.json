Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are mainly produced at the early stage of the collision in hard parton scatterings, before the plasma formation, and thus participate in all the subsequent stages of the collision. In their propagation through the medium, they interact with other partons and lose energy via elastic (collisional) and inelastic (gluon radiation) processes, commonly treated in the perturbative approach of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). These processes are expected to depend on the parton in-medium path length, colourcharge and mass [1,2]. This results in a characteristic ordering of the energy loss of partons: \u2206E(g) > \u2206E(u, d, s) > \u2206E(c) > \u2206E(b).",

Additionally, the nuclear modification factor of D mesons has been measured as a function of N part , the average number of nucleons participating in the Pb-Pb collisions [12]. The results are shown in figure 2 (left), where they are compared to those obtained by ALICE for charged pions [13] and by CMS for J/\u03a8 coming from beauty decays [14], in a similar kinematic range (high p t and central rapidity). As can be seen, R AA (J/\u03a8 \u2190 B) is found to be significantly larger than R AA (D + , D 0 , D * + ) in central collisions, which is consistent with the parton energy loss hierarchy. Such an observation is in qualitative agreement with several theoretical predictions involving a mass dependence of parton energy loss processes (Djordjevic et al. [15], MC@sHQ+EPOS2 [16] and TAMU elastic [17]). On the other hand, the data show a quite similar R AA for high-p t pions and D mesons. This might be explained as due to the interplay between the colour-charge dependence of parton energy loss, and the different p t and fragmentation distributions for gluons and charm quarks. At low p t , any direct interpretation is complicated since, in contrast to heavy-flavour hadrons, light-flavour hadron yields do not scale with the number of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions but rather with the number of participant nucleons. Moreover, radial flow and cold nuclear matter effects affect differently pions and D mesons.",

Although R AA (D + s ) is compatible with the average R AA of non-strange D mesons within uncertainties, the current precision does not allow for drawing a firm conclusion on a possible signature of recombination mechanism working for charm quarks. An increase of the relative fraction of strange versus non-strange D mesons is indeed expected by the TAMU model, at low and intermediate p t [18].  The diversity of open-charm measurements carried out by ALICE offers a valuable basis to constrain models. The results encompass both nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow [19] of different D-meson species as a function of p t and the collision centrality. An attempt to describe simultaneously all measured observables, for charged pions and D mesons, within various theoretical models has been made in a recent ALICE paper [10]. While all models rely on a colour-charge and mass dependence of energy loss, the interaction mechanisms are not yet clearly accessed. As a general rule, gluon radiation seems to be needed to describe high-p t R AA (D), whereas collisional interactions appear to be important for the understanding of low-p t R AA and v 2 measurements. Although the role of the recombination -which should help describing low-p t v 2 -is open to debate, it is generally accepted that an expanding medium gives rise to the observed non-zero v 2 . As shown in [10], models fairly describing heavy-flavour hadron data do not necessarily manage to simultaneously reproduce pion data. In particular, only few models are able to describe both hadron species but only at high p t : Djordjevic et al. [15], CUJET3.0 [20] and Vitev et al. [21]. It is worth noting that the latest includes in-medium meson formation and dissociation as an energy loss mechanism, on top of collisional interactions, instead of the commonly used radiative process.",

            "text": "Charm quark is an efficient tool to probe QCD in its perturbative regime and to give insights into the various stages of a heavy-ion collision, from its early stage to the interaction processes occurring in the hot and dense medium until hadronization. By exploiting LHC Run I, ALICE started providing constraints on theoretical models aiming at the description of charm physics. Energy loss processes can be studied with the diversity of measured observables. However, a simultaneous description of all open-charm data stays challenging. More sophisticated models together with more precise measurements, coming from the ongoing LHC Run II data taking, will be further needed to draw a clearer picture of the interaction mechanisms taking place throughout heavy-ion collisions.",
