Contributions in bins are proportional to the area of boxes and the normalizations are different in all three cases. If a box is crossed the model prediction is larger than the experimental data. We see that three patterns are rather different in shape and in the case of Figs. 1 and 2 they may indicate that the models do not reproduce the cross section Q 2 dependence very well. In all the cases there is a significant deficit of events in the region cos \u03b8 \u03bc \u223c 1.

Figure 5 shows the contributions to \u03c7 2 TEM,min with the low momentum cut. Finally, we tried to understand why for the TEM model \u03c7 2 Q 2 ,min is relatively small even if there are 2D bins giving large contribution to \u03c7 2 2D,min . We selected three such bins: T \u03bc \u2208 (500, 600) MeV and cos \u03b8 \u03bc \u2208 (\u22120.1, 0.2) with contributions: 9.5, 7.2 and 5.5 (see Fig. 5). We checked that according to TEM events from the selected bins contribute to two Q 2 QE bins (in GeV 2 ): (1.2, 1.5) and (1.5, 2) with cross sections (in the units of cm 2 /MeV 2 ) 5.42 \u00d7 10 \u221248 and 1.44 \u00d7 10 \u221247 respectively. We checked that these contributions represent a small fraction of the overall cross section in the last Q 2 QE bin and the large disagreement in three selected 2D bins mostly hidden in the Q 2 QE analysis, however some deficit of events is still there. It is clear that in order to get a deeper insight into CCQE, the complete 2D data should be used. To conclude: it seems that the ELAMM leads to a little better agreement with the MB CCQE data. However, both models can be very useful provided they can reproduce CCQE data also for larger values of neutrino energies.",
