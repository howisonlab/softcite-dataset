The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , were recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The analysis focuses on the vector-like quark decay into a top quark and a W boson, with one muon or electron in the final state. The mass of the vector-like quark candidate is reconstructed from hadronic jets, the lepton, and the missing transverse momentum. Methods for the identification of b quarks and of highly Lorentz boosted hadronically decaying top quarks and W bosons are exploited in this search. No significant deviation from the standard model background expectation is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction as a function of the vector-like quark mass, which range from 0.3 to 0.03 pb for vector-like quark masses of 700 to 2000 GeV. Mass exclusion limits up to 1660 GeV are obtained, depending on the vector-like quark type, coupling, and decay width. These represent the most stringent exclusion limits for the single production of vectorlike quarks in this channel.",

            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson (H) [1,2] with a mass of 125 GeV completes the particle content of the standard model (SM). Even though the SM yields numerous accurate predictions, there are several open questions, among them the origin of the H mass stability at the electroweak scale. Various models beyond the SM have been proposed that stabilise the H mass at the measured value; some examples are Little Higgs [3][4][5] or Composite Higgs models [6], in which additional top quark partners with masses at the TeV scale are predicted. Since the left-(LH) and right-handed (RH) chiral components of these particles transform in the same way under the SMelectroweak symmetry group, they are often e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch referred to as \"vector-like quarks\" (VLQs). In contrast to a fourth chiral quark generation, their impact on the H properties is small, such that VLQs have not been excluded by the measurements of H mediated cross sections [7][8][9].",

Many of these analyses study the pair production of VLQs via the strong interaction. In contrast, the analysis presented here searches for the single VLQ production via the weak interaction, where a hadronic jet is emitted at a low angle with respect to the beam direction. Furthermore, VLQs with enhanced couplings to the third generation quarks (i.e. VLQ B and X 5/3 quarks with an electric charge of 1/3 and 5/3 respectively) are produced in association with a bottom (b) or top (t) quark, leading to the B+b, B+t, and X 5/3 +t production modes.",

For signal events, the mass of the B and X 5/3 quarks can be reconstructed using hadronic jets, the lepton, and the p miss T . The associated b and t, as well as the leptons originating from their decay, have much lower transverse momenta p T and are not considered for the reconstruction or selection.",

The samples with 1% relative VLQ width are simulated in steps of 100 GeV for masses between 700 and 2000 GeV. Samples with 10, 20, and 30% relative VLQ widths are generated in steps of 200 GeV for masses ranging from 800 to 2000 GeV, using a modified version of the model proposed in Refs. [52][53][54]. Separate signal samples are generated for the two main production modes, in which VLQs are produced in association either with a b quark or with a t quark, viz. pp \u2192 Bbq and pp \u2192 Btq. The theoretical cross sections for VLQ production are calculated using Refs. [55][56][57], where a simplified approach is used to provide a model-independent interpretation of experimental results for narrow and large mass width scenarios, as already used for the interpretation of singly produced vector-like T and B quarks [18,19]. The MADSPIN package [58,59] is used to retain the correct spin correlations of the top quark and W boson decay products. Interference effects between signal and SM processes have been found to be negligible in this analysis.",

For each event, jets are clustered from reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear safe anti-k T algorithm [36] with a distance parameter R = 0.4 (AK4 jet). Additionally, jets with R = 0.8 (AK8 jet) are also clustered in every event with the anti-k T algorithm, which are used for t and W tagging. The jet clustering is performed with the FastJet [37] package. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5-10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation studies so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in the jet energy scale in data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [61].",

The uncertainty on the W tagging efficiency is determined from jet mass resolution (JMR) and scale (JMS) uncertainties, which are added in quadrature. An additional JMR uncertainty is derived from the differences in the hadronisation and shower models of pythia and her-wig++ [72]. The uncertainty depends on the p T of the W boson; for VLQs with a mass of 700 GeV it is around 2% and for a mass of 1800 GeV it is around 6%. An uncertainty of 1% is assigned to the JMS, as obtained from In Table 1, a summary of the uncertainties considered for signal events is shown, where the largest uncertainties come from the jet energy scale and the jet tagging. For the uncertainties connected to the PDF, \u03bc f and \u03bc r only the signal acceptance and shape differences are propagated.

Vector-like quarks in the single production mode can be produced in association with a t or a b quark and a forward jet. The latter feature is used to obtain the background prediction in the signal regions from data. The mass of the vector-like quark is reconstructed from the hadronic jets, the missing transverse momentum, and the lepton in the event. Different decay possibilities of the t and W are considered. The reach of the search is enhanced by t, W, and b tagging methods. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is observed. Upper exclusion limits at 95% confi-  dence level on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction range from around 0.3-0.03 pb for vectorlike quark masses between 700 and 2000 GeV.
