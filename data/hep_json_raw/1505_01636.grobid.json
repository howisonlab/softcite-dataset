The study is based on four recently proposed observables that are sensitive to coherence effects in the perturbative regime. The measurement of these observables is presented, along with a comparison with the predictions of different parton shower models. The models include both conventional parton shower models and dipole antenna models. Different ordering variables are used to investigate their influence on the predictions.",

It is therefore important to account for QCD effects and to model them accurately. Colour coherence, the destructive interference effect between colour-connected partons, is an important aspect of high energy collisions and QCD parton cascades. Coherence is itself a subject of considerable interest, and QCD offers a situation in which coherence effects in a perturbative framework can be studied in a uniquely precise way. Furthermore, by testing different theoretical schemes for coherence, QCD Monte Carlo (MC) event generators (see Refs. [2][3][4][5] for recent reviews) can be modified to better describe the results of experiments. For example, in newphysics searches at the CERN LHC, QCD multijet events For the author list of the OPAL collaboration refer to Ref. [1]. a e-mail: nadine.fischer@monash.edu often represent the most difficult SM background to characterize. Improvements in the reliability of QCD event generators may help to better constrain this background.",

            "text": "The e + e \u2212 annihilation process offers a favorable environment to study colour coherence, because the lack of strong interactions in the initial state allows simple and conclusive comparisons between experiment and theory. Previous studies of coherence in e + e \u2212 annihilation events are presented, for example, in Refs. [6,7]. Within the context of a QCD shower, coherence implies an ordering condition, such as a requirement that each subsequent emission angle in the shower be smaller than the previous angle [8,9]. However, there are many ambiguities in the definition of the ordering variable and in its implementation. In this study, we present the first experimental tests of recently proposed [10] observables designed to discriminate between coherence schemes. The data were collected with the OPAL detector at the CERN LEP collider at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 91 GeV. The observables examined here are based on four-jet e + e \u2212 annihilation configurations in which a soft gluon is emitted in the context of a three-jet topology, with two of the three jets approximately collinear. This event configuration has been shown to be favorable for the manifestation of coherence [11] and sensitive to the choice of the ordering variable in the shower [12].",

The pair of objects with the smallest y i j is combined by summing their four-momenta and the sum is added to the list while the original four-momenta are removed. This procedure is iterated until one entry is left in the list. To obtain an inclusive four-jet event sample in the perturbative regime we impose an explicit requirement on the value of the clustering scale at which the event goes from having four to having three jets. Denoting this scale (given by the value of min(y i j ) evaluated at the stage when the event has been clustered to four jets) by y 4\u21923 , we require y 4\u21923 > 0.0045 (corresponding to ln(y 4\u21923 ) > \u22125.4), as in Ref. [10]. This value originates from a compromise; on the one hand a smaller value results in a data sample with greater statistical precision, and on the other hand a larger value provides a more direct representation of the shower properties. We investigate four different observables, where for the first three we consider the event clustered into four jets, and order the jets in energy. To be sensitive to coherence, the angles between the jets are constrained such that the first (hardest) jet lies back-to-back to a nearly collinear jet pair, formed by the second and third jet: \u03b8 12 > 2\u03c0/3, \u03b8 13 > 2\u03c0/3, and \u03b8 23 < \u03c0/6.

The tuning procedure is described in Ref. [10], including the utilized LEP observables available through Rivet [38], and the resulting parameter values. Since the level of coherence is fixed for each algorithm (dictated by the choice of shower radiation functions, ordering variable, and recoil strategy), this retuning brings the models on as near a comparable footing as we can achieve, while the essential, coherence-driven differences should remain. We emphasize that further MC comparisons can easily be made using the Rivet analysis published accompanying this measurement.",

The jet chamber was approximately 4 m long and had an outer radius of about 1.85 m. This device had 24 sectors each containing 159 sense wires spaced by 1 cm. All tracking systems were located inside a solenoidal magnet, which provided a uniform axial magnetic field of 0.435 T along the beam axis. The magnet was surrounded by a lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter and a sampling hadron calorimeter. The electromagnetic calorimeter consisted of 11,704 lead glass blocks, divided into barrel and endcap sections, covering 98 % of the solid angle. Outside the hadron calorimeter, the detector was surrounded by a system of muon chambers. Similar layers of instrumentation were located in the endcap regions.",

During the second phase of operation, denoted LEP2 (1995-2000), the center-of-mass energy was increased in successive steps from 130 to 209 GeV. Interspersed at various times during the LEP2 operation, calibration runs were collected at the Z boson peak. In this analysis, we utilize data collected at \u221a s = 91.2 GeV during the LEP2 calibration runs. This allows us to exploit conditions when the detector was operating in its final, most advanced configuration. In addition, this will facilitate possible future comparisons with data collected under essentially identical conditions at higher energies. We use a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 14.7 pb \u22121 . This sample is of sufficient size that systematic uncertainties dominate the statistical terms. To correct the data in order to account for experimental acceptance and efficiency, simulated event samples produced with MC event generators are used. The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq is simulated using Pythia6.1 [42] at \u221a s = 91.2 GeV. Corresponding samples using Herwig 6.2 [43,44] are used for systematic checks. We examine the MC events at two levels. We refer to \"hadron level\" as events without event selection, and without simulation of the detector acceptance and resolution, for which all particles with lifetimes less than 300 ps decay. In contrast, \"detector level\" refers to MC events that are processed through the Geant-based simulation of the OPAL detector, called Gopal [45], and that have been reconstructed using the same software procedures that are applied to the data. The MC events generated for the detector-level samples are the same as the hadron-level samples except that K 0 S mesons and weakly decaying hyperons are declared to be stable, as these particles can interact with detector material before decaying, and so their decays are handled within the Geant framework.",

A similar discrepancy, at the level of around 2.5 standard deviations, is observed for the Herwig++q 2 model. The two versions of Vincia exhibit deviations of about one standard deviation in the opposite sense, i.e., Vincia m 2 ant somewhat overpredicts the level of hard fourth-jet emissions, whereas Vincia p 2 \u22a5ant predicts too few hard fourth-jet emissions. In contrast, the Herwig++ p 2 \u22a5dip and Pythia8 models are in nearly perfect agreement with the data.  Fig. 8a, b. For the Pythia8 and the two Vincia models, we find reasonable overall agreement with the data, with differences on the level of two standard deviations or less. The Herwig++ models demonstrate larger differences, with discrepancies reaching the level of four standard deviations for the Herwig++ q 2 dip model. In Fig. 8c, d we show the asymmetry of the \u03c1 variable as a function of the dividing point \u03c1 0 . This asymmetry is sensitive to the relative number of same-side versus oppositeside events, whose definitions were given in Sect. 2.1. This asymmetry is seen to provide discrimination between most of the shower models. The Pythia8 and Herwig++q 2 models yield predictions that lie within one standard deviation of the data. However, the Herwig++ q 2 dip model predicts too small an asymmetry by about four standard deviations, meaning that there are too few same-side compared to opposite-side events. The two Vincia models also predict too few sameside events, but only at the level of around one standard deviation. In contrast, the Herwig++ p 2 \u22a5dip model predicts relatively too many same-side events, at the level of two standard deviations.",

The data, corresponding to a sample of about 397,000 hadronic annihilation events, were collected with the OPAL detector at LEP. The event selection criteria are defined in a way to minimize the influence of non-perturbative (hadronization) effects. We compared the data with six different models for the parton shower, based on the Herwig++, Pythia8, and Vincia Monte Carlo event generator programs, which differ in the choice of the radiation function, ordering variable, and recoil strategy. Each of the six models was found to be in general agreement with the data.

Thus our results emphasize the importance of incorporating coherence into the description of the QCD multijet process. Since Herwig++ uses the cluster [23] and Pythia8 and Vincia use the Lund string [58,59] hadronization model, a direct comparison of the predictions from the two groups of shower models is somewhat ambiguous. It would be interesting to perform a comparison based on use of the same hadronization model for all models. However, when comparing all shower models together, we find Pythia8 and Vincia to give the best description of the measurements presented here. ",
