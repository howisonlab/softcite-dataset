Events containing seven or more jets are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . To separate the ttH signal from the irreducible tt + bb background, the analysis assigns leading order matrix element signal and background probability densities to each event. A likelihoodratio statistic based on these probability densities is used to extract the signal. The results are provided in terms of an observed ttH signal strength relative to the standard model production cross section \u00b5 = \u03c3/\u03c3 SM , assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The best fit value is\u03bc = 0.9 \u00b1 0.7(stat) \u00b1 1.3(syst) = 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 (tot), and the observed and expected upper limits are, respectively, \u00b5 < 3.8 and < 3.1 at 95% confidence levels.",

            "text": "Since the observation of a new boson with a mass of approximately 125 GeV [1][2][3], a major focus of the program of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC has been to measure the properties of this particle. To date, all measurements remain consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H) hypothesis. The new particle has been observed in \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, and \u03c4 \u03c4 decays [4][5][6][7][8][9][10], and evidence has been reported in bb final states [11,12]. The observed production and decay rates and spin-parity properties are compatible with SM expectations [13][14][15][16][17] and with the measured mass of m H = 125. 26 \u00b1 0.21 GeV [18]. This paper describes a search for the SM Higgs boson produced in association with a pair of top quarks (ttH production) in all-jet events, where the Higgs boson decays exclusively to bb, and each top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W boson, which in turn decays to two quarks. The analysis uses \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton (pp) collision data collected by the CMS detector in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .",

            "text": "In the context of probing the properties of the Higgs boson, the ttH process is interesting for several reasons. Because of the large top quark mass of m t = 172.44\u00b10. 48 GeV [19], the top quark Yukawa coupling (y t ) is close to unity, and it therefore plays a major role in many beyond the SM theories. Although model-dependent indirect measurements of y t -1 - have been made in processes involving top quark loops, such as in Higgs boson production through gluon-gluon fusion and in Higgs boson decays to photons, these loop processes can be influenced by new contributions. A direct measurement of y t is therefore crucial to constrain many beyond the SM models. As the direct measurements of y t have not yet reached suitable precision in specific final-state searches nor in their combinations, the addition of an independent search will enhance the overall sensitivity of such measurements.",

A quark-gluon discriminant is used to differentiate between events containing jets originating from light-flavour quarks and events containing jets from gluons. Given the many combinations of jet-quark associations, it is difficult to resolve a clear, resonant Higgs boson mass peak. Nevertheless, there are underlying kinematic differences between the ttH signal and the multijet background and, to a lesser extent, the tt+jets background. These differences are exploited through the matrix element method (MEM) [23, [26][27][28] to distinguish the signal from background. Specifically, events are assigned a probability density according to how compatible they are with the ttH process. Although this probability density suffices to separate the signal from most backgrounds, a second probability density is assigned to each event according to its compatibility with the tt+bb process, which provides additional discrimination against the topologically irreducible tt+bb background. The two probability densities are combined in a likelihood ratio to form the final discriminant between signal and background.",

A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two end sections, reside within the field volume. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage beyond these barrel and end sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [29]. The first level, composed of specialized hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate close to 100 kHz, ascertained within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to \u22481 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [30].",

The ttH cross section and Higgs boson branching fractions are also generated at NLO accuracy [49]. The simulated tt events are normalized to the full NNLO calculation, including soft-gluon resummation at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy [50], assuming m t = 172.5 GeV. The dependence on choice of the PDFs was also studied and found to have negligible impact on all observed distributions; however, their impact on systematic uncertainties enters through their normalization. As the differential measurements of top quark pair production indicate that the measured p T spectrum of top quarks is softer than in simulation [51], the top quark p T distribution in powheg-generated tt events is reweighted to the data using a control region enriched in lepton+jets tt events. The events in the tt sample are also separated according to the flavour of additional jets that do not originate from top quark decays, namely: tt+bb, where two additional b jets are within the acceptance defined in section 4 and originate from one or more b quarks; tt+b, where only one b jet is within the acceptance and originates from a single b quark; tt+2b, where a single b jet is within the acceptance and originates from two spatially close -4 -JHEP06(2018)101 b quarks; tt+cc, where there is at least one c jet and no additional b jets within the acceptance; and tt+light-flavour partons (tt+lf). The separation is motivated by the fact that the subsamples originate from different processes and therefore have different associated systematic uncertainties.",

The lepton veto ensures that leptonic final states in ttH production are not considered, as these are covered by separate searches at CMS. Jets are reconstructed from particle-flow candidates using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [53], implemented in the FastJet [54] package, using a distance parameter of 0.4. In the offline reconstruction, each jet is required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and ECAL and HCAL energy fractions of at least 1%, which removes jets originating from instrumental effects.

The algorithm JHEP06 (2018)101combines information on the impact parameters at the primary vertex with features of secondary vertices within the jet, via a neural network discriminant. The least restrictive (\"loose\") and \"medium\" working points of the CSVv2 algorithm have respective efficiencies of \u224880 and 65% for tagging jets originating from b quarks, \u224835 and 10% for jets originating from c quarks, and probabilities of \u224810 and 1% for jets from light-flavour quarks or gluons to be misidentified as b jets. In the remainder of this paper, jets passing the loose and medium b tagging working points are referred to as CSVL and CSVM jets, respectively. The distribution in the output of the CSVv2 discriminant in simulation is corrected using scale factors to provide a better description of the observed features in data. This correction is obtained separately for light-flavour and b jets via a \"tag-and-probe\" approach [59] in dilepton control samples enriched in events with a Z boson and two jets, and in tt events with no additional jets, respectively. No correction is applied for c jets, although a larger systematic uncertainty is assigned to such jets, as described in section 7.",

Since the power of this test is limited by the statistical uncertainty in simulated QCD multijet events, the method is validated in data using events with QGLR < 0.5, by applying the same procedure used to estimate the multijet background in the SR. The distributions in the MEM discriminant, described in section 6, as well as several kinematic variables in the VR in data, together with the multijet background estimate obtained from data, and other simulated contributions, are shown for the most sensitive event category, (\u22659j, \u22654b), in figure 4. All discrepancies are taken into account via the systematic uncertainties in the multijet background, particularly in events with low H T in the (7j, 3b) category and in all \u22654b categories, in which two uncorrelated uncertainties are applied, as discussed in section 7. . The level of agreement between data and estimation is expressed in terms of a \u03c7 2 divided by the number of degrees of freedom (dof), which are given along with their corresponding statistical p-values.

Specifically, the b tagging criteria are changed by selecting jets that fulfil some intermediate but not the formal medium b tagging requirement, which corresponds to an efficiency for tagging b jets of \u224875% with a misidentification rate of \u22484%. The classified jets are then used to form jet and b jet multiplicity categories in analogy with the SR. Since these categories are orthogonal to the categories in the SR, they are used to verify that the background estimation is valid for QGLR > 0.5.

The accepted jet permutations must retain the assigned \"b\" status of their quarks. To account for the loss of jets because of limited detector acceptance, as well as the presence of additional jets from gluon radiation, the method integrates over certain final-state variables in many categories, specifically over quark directions. In events with eight jets and four b jets, one light-flavour jet is excluded from our MEM calculation in turn, and a sum is taken over the additional permutations. This approach has been checked and shown to provide improved performance relative to the fully reconstructed hypothesis in the (8j, \u22654b) category. Events with only three b jets are assumed to have lost a bottom quark from the decay of a top quark. Up to five untagged jets are considered as other than b quark candidates, while additional untagged jets are ignored. For five such quark candidates, one is excluded in turn and the number of permutations is increased by a factor of five. The final choice of hypothesis for each category, optimized according to discrimination power and computing performance, is given in table 2. For each event, the MEM probability density function under the signal (S) or background (B) hypothesis, i.e. H = ttH (S) or H = tt+bb (B), is calculated as:",

The uncertainty in the distribution in the number of pileup interactions is evaluated by changing the total inelastic cross section in the MC simulation by its uncertainty of 4.6%. The changes in the weight factors are propagated to the MEM discriminant distributions and treated as fully correlated among all processes. The impact of the uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES) [55] is evaluated for each jet in the simulated events by changing the correction factors by their uncertainties, and propagating the effect to the MEM discriminant by recalculating all kinematic quantities. Various independent sources contribute to the overall JES uncertainty, and their impact is therefore evaluated separately and they are treated as uncorrelated in the final fit. A similar procedure is applied to account for the uncertainty related to the JER, which ranges between about 1 and 5% of the expected energy resolution, depending on the jet direction. Since the analysis categories are defined in terms of jet multiplicity and kinematics, a change in either JES or JER can induce a migration of events between categories, as well as in the SR.
