The main goal was the measurement of the ratio of the rates of the leptonic kaon decays K \u00b1 \u2192 e\u03bd e (K e2 ) and K \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 (K \u00b52 ). 3 The large statistics accumulated by both experiments has allowed the studies of a variety of rare kaon decay modes.",

Higher order corrections including O(p 6 ) contribution have been found to modify the decay spectrum and rate significantly. A sample of more than 300 K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3\u03b3 rare decays with a background contamination below 10% has been collected during a 3-day NA48/2 run (2004) and a 3-month NA62 run (2007) at low intensity with minimum bias trigger configuration. The results 5\u22126 are obtained at increased precision and set stronger constrains on ChPT predictions. The observed decay spectrum agrees with the ChPT description and the preliminary combination of the measured ChPT parameters are\u0109 4 = 1.56 \u00b1 0.23 and c 6 = 2.00 \u00b1 0.26.

The experimental precision is however limited by the knowledge of  the form factors (FF) of this decay, since they enter both the phase space integral and the detector acceptances. The NA48/2 experiment presents new measurements of the FF of K \u00b1 semileptonic decays, based on 4.3 million K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e\u03bd e (K \u00b1 e3 ) and 3.5 million K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5\u03bd e (K \u00b1 \u00b53 ) decays collected in 2004, both with negligible background. The hadronic matrix element of the K \u00b1 3 ( = e or \u00b5) decays is described by two dimensionless FF which depend on the squared four-momentum transferred to the \u2212 \u03bd system. They can be expressed in terms of vector f + (t) and scalar f 0 (t) exchange contributions, parametrized either as a Taylor expansion (\"quadratic parametrization\"), quantified with \u03bb coefficients, or by assuming the dominance of vector (V) or scalar (S) resonance exchange (\"pole parametrization\"), where pole masses are the only free parameters. Figure 2 (right) shows the preliminary comparison of combined quadratic fit results for K \u00b1 3 decays from NA48/2 and other experiments. 7 The ellipses represent 68% Confidence Level (C.L.) contours. The NA48/2 results agree with other experiments and match the precision of the world average on the vector and scalar FF, allowing an improved precision on the K \u00b1 3 form factor contribution to the |V us |uncertainty. The combined K \u00b1 e3 \u2212K \u00b1 \u00b53 results from NA48/2 are the first high precision FF measurement with both K + and K \u2212 mesons.

The decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd is highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM), while its rate can be predicted with minimal theoretical uncertainty (BR SM = (0.781\u00b10.080)\u00d710 \u221210 ). 10 This BR is a sensitive probe of the flavor sector of the SM. However, its smallness and the challenging experimental signature make it very difficult to measure. The only measurement 11 is compatible with the SM within a large uncertainty. The challenging aspect which drives the design of the NA62 experiment is the suppression of kaon decays with branching fractions of many orders of magnitude higher than the signal This is achieved by collecting about 100 signal events with 10% background in two years of data taking, which requires the observation of at least 10 13 K + decays in the experiment's fiducial volume. To achieve the needed level of background rejection, NA62 relies on: high-resolution timing, to support a high-rate environment; kinematic rejection, involving cutting on the squared missing mass of the system of incident kaon and observed charged particle under pion assumption; particle identification of kaons, pions, muons, electrons and photons; hermetic vetoing of photons out to large angles from the decay region and of muons within the acceptance; redundancy of information. A suitable experimental apparatus 12 has been conceived to fulfill these purposes. The layout, shown in Fig. 1 (right), has the following main features.",

A precise measurement of the helicity-suppressed ratio of the leptonic kaon decay rates, R K = \u0393(K e2 )/\u0393(K \u00b52 ), has been obtained 3 . A world-record sample of about 150,000 reconstructed K e2 candidates with 11% background contamination was analyzed. The result R K = (2.488 \u00b1 0.007 stat \u00b1 0.007 syst )\u00d7 10 \u22125 agrees with the SM expectation and is the most precise measurement to date. The record accuracy of 0.4% constrains the parameter space of new physics models with extended Higgs sector, a fourth generation of quarks and leptons or sterile neutrinos.",
