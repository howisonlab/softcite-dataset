(The gluon and the photon masses, at zero, are off the low end of a logarithmic scale, and neutrino masses which I will return to later.) Precision atomic physics measurements played a critical role in the development of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) sector of the SM, and the current poster-child for high-precision quantum-field theory is the anomalous magnetic momentum of the electron, where theory and experiment are in agreement at the level of one part in 10 13 [1,2]. Obtaining this precision in the theory requires the incorporation of electroweak and strong corrections, due to contributions to the interaction between the electron and the photon coming from loops involving virtual particles. As non-SM particles may also contribute in such loops, this measurement, coupled with precise measurements of the fine structure constant, can set a limit on some types of new physics models at energy scales much higher than atomic physics scales [3]. The same is true of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and as many new physics contributions scale with the square of the lepton mass, the sensitivity of these measurements to such contributions is higher. The muon anomalous magnetic moment is less precisely known than that of the electron (though still to an impressive accuracy of about one part in 10 10 ), and currently exhibits a 3.6\u03c3 discrepancy between theory and measurement. Taken at face value, this is evidence for physics beyond the SM, potentially at scales close to the electroweak scale (10 11 eV). New measurements and improved calculations will hopefully soon clarify the situation [4].",

Jets are seen, for example, in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons, for centre-of-mass energies of more than a few 10 9 eV, where the underlying process at leading order in the perturbative expansion is taken to be the electroweak annihilation of the electron and positron to a virtual photon (\u03b3 ) or Z boson, which then decays to qq. While weakly coupled at short distances, those partons will, as they fly apart, experience the linearly increasing confinement potential mentioned in the previous section. The increasing potential energy with distance implies that it is energetically favourable to create more partons, shortening the distances over which the potential acts; a process ending at lower energies in the production of colour-neutral hadrons. These hadrons form collimated jets which preserve, to a great extent, the kinematics of the initiating partons. The production of three-jet events [13] at the Petra collider in DESY [14] was generally seen as the first direct evidence for the existence of gluons, as the kinematics and cross sections were as predicted by calculations of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 qqg. Jets have been measured precisely in e + e \u2212 , ep, pp and pp collisions and provide a stringent test of QCD and a sensitive probe of short-distance physics.",

Electron-proton collisions can not only be mediated by photon exchange, but also by the exchange of weak bosons, the W and the Z. As the W carries electric charge, those events will have distinct final states, in which the emerging scattered lepton has turned into a neutrino. As might be expected, the rates of these 'charged-current' events are much lower than those of the electromagnetic scatters, reflecting the relative strength of the electromagentic and weak forces. However, as the energy scale increases, the rates converge, until at around 10 11 eV, they become roughly equal. This effect, measured at HERA [20], reflects the fact that most of the apparent difference in strength of the two forces at lower energies is due to the different propagator masses (zero for the photon, 10 11 eV for the W and Z). Once the energy is such that these masses are no longer important, a symmetry is restored, and the forces become comparable in strength.

Increasing the energy far above the electroweak scale means that objects with masses around the electroweak scale can also be produced with high energies and/or in high numbers. In the SM, this means top quarks and the W, Z and Higgs bosons. Describing with any degree of precision the final states thus produced requires innovative calculational techniques. In particular, there is a need for the theory to be able to reproduce what is actually measured by the experiment. This means that calculations of 'inclusive' quantities, which integrate over large regions of phase space, are not sufficient, as the experiments must place selection requirements on the final state. For example, the detectors have a limited angular (rapidity) acceptance, and also cannot measure jets or particles at arbitrarily low transverse momenta. If the theory can only calculate total cross sections, or totally inclusive quantities, then extrapolations have to be applied to the data in order to make comparisons. These extrapolations must make some theoretical assumptions-typically, they will use Monte Carlo event generators, which simulate the fully exclusive final state [39]. The accuracy of the comparison is likely then not limited by the inclusive theory calculation, or by the intrinsic experimental uncertainty, but by the accuracy of the generator, as well as by the assumption that no unexpected physics occurs in the regions which are not covered by the detector.",

The matrix element calculations at the heart of event generators can be increased in multiplicity, thus filling phase space more accurately, and can also incorporate the full complement of higher-order terms, which means also including diagrams involving loops (similar to those implicated in the muon magnetic moment, discussed above). In the latter case, the precision of the calculation is systematically improved. There are, however, regions of phase space which contain kinematic enhancements which mean such an approach converges very slowly, if at all. Such enhancements typically occur when partons are soft or almost collinear-for example, in the early stages of jet formation. They usually occur in such a way that the emission of a new parton introduces a large logarithm of the ratio of some kinematic factors, which can negate the suppression arising from the introduction of an additional \u03b1 s factor, and imply that the series will not converge. Fortunately, techniques have been developed to cast such terms in the form of summable series; they have also been implemented algorithmically in Monte Carlo generators in the form of 'parton showers', which are essential to obtain accurate descriptions of the final state.",

The multiplicity and distribution of jets accompanying the Higgs are used to obtain separate sensitivity to the various production mechanisms (e.g. between gluon fusion and vector boson fusion) and are intrinsic to the selection of some types of event. Measuring the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson production offers a more rigorous probe of the SM than measuring the integrated total.

Jet substructure has increased relevance when the jet scale lies above the electroweak scale, as particles with masses around the electroweak scale (W, Z and Higgs bosons and the top quark) may now be produced with high Lorentz boosts, and thus their decay products will be highly collimated and, in the case of hadronic decays, may be reconstructed as a single jet [45][46][47][48]. Such configurations have the advantage that combinatorial and other backgrounds can be suppressed, but they require the study of the substructure of jets in order to identify and reconstruct the decaying massive particle (see [49] for a review). Techniques based on these ideas have been widely employed in measurements at the LHC (for example, of the top quark transverse momentum [50]), and in searches both for the SM Higgs decaying to b-quarks and probes of the SM (and potentially beyond) close to the kinematic limit.",

The masses of the different flavours of fundamental fermions in the SM span a huge range, from the neutrinos at around 10 \u22121 eV to the top at 1.7 \u00d7 10 11 eV. The reasons for this are not contained within the SM itself. In addition, the mass eigenstates of the particles are not identical to their (flavour) eigenstates under the weak interaction, meaning that a unitary matrix with four free parameters is introduced in both the quark and lepton sectors. This leads to the phenomenon of 'mixing'-the flavour of quarks and leptons, which is defined as the weak eigenstate, can change as they propagate, mediated by the mass eigenstates. This matrix also encodes the possibility of the simultaneous violation of the charge and parity symmetries, CP violation.",

The matrix which is introduced to describe the mixing is known as the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, and its elements are now being measured with increasing precision by accelerator-and reactor-based neutrino experiments [56][57][58][59]. It is known that, unlike the CKM matrix, the off-diagonal elements are relatively large. That is, unlike the quark case where the flavour and mass eigenstates are almost aligned, the neutrino flavour eigenstates are an almost maximal mixture of the mass eigenstates. It is not yet known whether CP violation occurs in the neutrino sector-the relevant parameter of the PMNS matrix has not yet been measured.",

Some of the principles behind the theory trace their origins back to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism, and those equations remain the classical form of the quantized electromagnetic force within the theory (QED). QED itself, as a gauge theory, is the template for the weak and strong forces, themselves based on larger, non-Abelian gauge symmetries. The prediction that a scalar boson would appear at some scale below 10 12 eV, as a consequence of reconciling gauge symmetries and massive bosons, has been spectacularly vindicated, and extends the region of applicability of the SM potentially up to energies beyond the reach of particle colliders.",

Gravity is described by the general theory of relativity, and in that context is a consequence of the curvature of space-time rather than a force like those in the SM, mediated by gauge bosons. This is a very significant failure in the ambition to describe natural phenomena in a single framework. Worse, even in partnership with general relativity, the rotation curves of galaxies, weak lensing of light and the large-scale structure of the universe cannot be described without introducing 'Dark Matter', for which the SM does not contain a compelling candidate (though the possibility of strongly bound composite SM states is still discussed, e.g. [60]). The low level of CP violation possible from SM mechanisms has not been reconciled with the gross violation inherent in the fact that the observable universe seems to consist overwhelmingly of matter rather than antimatter. And finally, it is probably apparent from the preceding sections that the SM contains quite a lot of parameters with seemingly arbitrary, but suggestive, values. These include some, such as the Higgs mass, that look unnaturally 'fine tuned', to the extent that it is very tempting to think that they are fixed by some so-far unknown symmetry or principle inherent in a larger theory, of which the SM is just a part.",
