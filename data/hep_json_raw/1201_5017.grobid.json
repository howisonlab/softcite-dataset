Using this procedure we derive an upper limit on the Z yield in the signal region of n Z < 6.3, which we use to constrain the Z yield in the ML fit. The extracted signal yield is n S = 8.4 \u00b1 7.7, which is consistent with the background only hypothesis, as shown in Fig. 2 (lower-left). The expected LM1 yield in this region is 64 \u00b1 6 events. the predicted values in the LM1, LM3 and LM6 scenarios. For the specific benchmark SUSY cesses considered in this note, the results of the inclusive search achieve higher sensitivity n the results of the correlated flavor search. These results significantly extend the sensitivity our previous 2010 results [2]. e results of the counting experiments in the high E miss T and high H T signal regions are also ed to place model-dependent limits on the quantity \u03c3 \u00d7 A for the benchmark processes LM1, 3 and LM6. Here \u03c3 is the NLO cross-section and the acceptance is defined by the following uirements, applied to the generator-level quantities. We require the presence of at least 2 posite-sign leptons (electrons or muons) with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5; at least 1 of the tons must have p T > 20 GeV, and same-flavor lepton pairs with 76 < m() < 106 GeV are toed. We require at least 2 generator-level jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 3.0, separated \u2206R > 0.4 from any lepton passing the above selection; the generator-level H T is the scalar m of the transverse energies of these selected jets. The generator-level E miss T is the vector m of the transverse momenta of the invisible neutrinos and LSP's. For each signal region we lude the corresponding requirements on the generator-level E miss T and H T . The efficiency is fined with respect to events passing this acceptance selection. We place CL S 95% UL's on quantity \u03c3 \u00d7 A, and compare these limits to the expected values of this quantity for the 3 nchmark SUSY scenarios.

The first method focuses on models in which dilepton pairs are accompanied by significant hadronic activity and missing transverse energy. The other method focuses on models with a specific dilepton production mechanism, which leads to a characteristic edge in the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair. No evidence for new physics is found and limits on non-standard-model physics are derived.",
