The search targets final states with at least two leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large separation in rapidity. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The observed dijet invariant mass spectrum is found to be consistent with the expected standard model prediction. Upper limits are set on the cross sections for chargino and neutralino production with two associated jets, assuming the supersymmetric partner of the \u03c4 lepton to be the lightest slepton and the lightest slepton to be lighter than the charginos. For a so-called compressed-mass-spectrum scenario in which the mass difference between the lightest supersymmetric particle \u03c7 0 1 and the next lightest, mass-degenerate, gaugino particles \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 is 50 GeV, a mass lower limit of 170 GeV is set for these latter two particles.",

            "text": "With the successful operation of the CERN LHC, numerous results placing constraints on extensions to the standard model (SM) have been presented by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. In particular, in models of supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], limits in excess of 1 TeV have been placed on the masses of the strongly produced gluinos and first-and secondgeneration squarks [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. In contrast, mass limits on the weakly produced charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 i ) and neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 i ), with much smaller production cross sections, are much less severe. The limits for charginos and neutralinos are especially weak in so-called compressed-massspectrum scenarios, in which the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is only slightly less than the masses of other SUSY states. The chargino-neutralino sector plays a crucial role in the connection between dark matter and SUSY: in SUSY models with R-parity [16] conservation, the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 often takes the role of the LSP and is a dark matter candidate.",

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, were collected with the CMS detector in 2012. Besides the two oppositely directed forward jets (j) that define the VBF configuration, the search requires the presence of at least two leptons (e, \u00b5, or \u03c4 ) and large p miss T . The events are classified into one of eight final states depending on the dilepton content and charges e\u00b5jj, \u00b5\u00b5jj, \u00b5\u03c4 h jj, and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h jj, where \u03c4 h denotes a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton and where we differentiate between final states with same-sign (SS) JHEP11 (2015)189and opposite-sign (OS) dilepton pairs. The dijet invariant mass distribution m jj is used to search for the SUSY signal. Stringent requirements are placed on p miss T and on the kinematic properties of the VBF dijet system to suppress SM background. In particular, the R-parity conserving SUSY models we examine predict much higher average dijet p T than is typical for SM processes such as VBF Higgs boson production [21], allowing us to suppress the background by a factor of 10 2 -10 4 , depending on the background process.",

Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

The anti-k T clustering algorithm [25] with a distance parameter of 0.5 is used for jet clustering. Jets are required to satisfy identification criteria designed to reject particles from multiple proton-proton interactions (pileup) and anomalous behavior from the calorimeters. For jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 5.0), the reconstruction-plus-identification efficiency is \u2248 99% (95%), while 90-95% (60%) of pileup jets are rejected [26]. The jet energy scale and resolution are calibrated through correction factors that depend on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet [27]. Jets originating from the hadronisation of bottom quarks (b quark jets) are identified using the loose working point of the combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm [28], which exploits observables related to the long lifetime of b hadrons. For jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, the probability of correctly identifying a b quark jet is \u2248 85%, while the probability of misidentifying a jet originating from a light quark or gluon as a b quark jet is \u2248 10% [29]. Muons are reconstructed [30] using the inner silicon tracker and muon detectors. Quality requirements based on the minimum number of hits in the silicon tracker, pixel detector, and muon detectors are applied to suppress backgrounds from decays-in-flight and hadron shower remnants that reach the muon system. Electrons are reconstructed [31] by combining tracks produced by the Gaussian-sum filter algorithm with ECAL clusters. Requirements on the track quality, the shape of the energy deposits in the ECAL, and the compatibility of the measurements from the tracker and the ECAL are imposed to distinguish prompt electrons from charged pions and from electrons produced by photon conversions. The electron and muon reconstruction efficiencies are > 99% for p T > 10 GeV.",

A correction is applied to the isolation variable to account for the effects of additional interactions. For charged particles, only tracks associated with the primary vertex are included in the isolation sums. The primary vertex is the reconstructed vertex with the largest sum of charged-track p 2 T values associated to it. For neutral particles, a correction is applied by subtracting the energy deposited in the isolation cone by charged particles not associated with the primary vertex, multiplied by a factor of 0.5. This factor corresponds approximately to the ratio of neutral to charged hadron production in the hadronisation process of pileup interactions. In both cases, the contribution from the electron or muon candidate is removed from the sum and the value of the isolation variable is required to be 0.2 or less.",

Control regions enriched with tt events are obtained by requiring the presence of at least one reconstructed b-tagged jet with p T > 20 GeV. The tt purity of the resulting data CR1s depends on the final state, ranging from 76 to 99%. The contributions of backgrounds other than tt events are subtracted from the data CR1s using simulation. The scale factors SF CR1 tt are then determined. The uncertainties related to the subtraction procedure are propagated to the scale factors. For the OS channels, the scale factors are consistent with unity to within 3%. The tt events with OS lepton pairs arise from genuine isolated leptons produced through leptonic W boson decay, and are well modeled by the simulation. On the other hand, tt events with SS lepton pairs mostly contain a lepton candidate that is a misidentified hadron or jet, which is more difficult to accurately simulate. The scale factors for SS events range from 1.2 to 1.5, with statistical uncertainties up to 25%. Since the fraction of lepton candidates that are in fact a misidentified hadron or jet varies according to the final state, the scale factors are determined independently for each channel. In contrast, the VBF efficiency for a given combination of lepton flavors does not depend on the charge state, and thus each pair of final states with the same flavor combination shares the same VBF efficiency value. The VBF efficiency is measured in data CR2 control samples obtained by additionally removing the charge requirement on the lepton pair and relaxing or inverting the lepton isolation requirement (isolation sidebands) in order to enhance the purity and statistical precision of the CR2s. Figure 2 shows the \"Tight\" and \"Loose\" VBF efficiencies measured from data, as a function of m jj , for events in the tt CR2s of the \u00b5\u00b5jj final states.

Systematic uncertainties are taken into account as nuisance parameters, which are removed by marginalization, assuming a gamma or log-normal prior for normalization parameters, and Gaussian priors for mass spectrum shape uncertainties. The combination of the eight search channels requires simultaneous analysis of the data from the individual channels, accounting for all statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations. Correlations among backgrounds, both within a channel and across channels, are taken into consideration in the limit calculation. For example, the uncertainties in physics object identification and reconstruction are treated as correlated for channels with a common particle in their final states, while the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is treated as correlated across channels. The uncertainties resulting from the number of simulated events, and from the event acceptance variation with different sets of PDFs in a given m jj bin, are treated as uncorrelated within a channel and correlated across channels. The uncertainties due to the closure tests are treated as uncorrelated within and across the different final states.",

This is the first search for SUSY in the VBF topology. The search utilizes events in eight different final states covering both same-and opposite-sign dilepton pairs. The leptons considered are electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. The VBF topology requires two well-separated jets that appear in opposite hemispheres, with large invariant mass m jj . The observed m jj distributions do not reveal any evidence for new physics. The results are used to exclude a range of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 gaugino masses. For models in which the \u03c7 0 1 lightest-supersymmetricparticle mass is zero, and in which the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 branching fractions to \u03c4 leptons are large, \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 masses up to 300 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. For a compressed-mass-spectrum scenario, in which m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = 50 GeV, the corresponding limit is 170 GeV. While many previous studies at the LHC have focused on strongly coupled supersymmetric particles, including searches for charginos and neutralinos produced in gluino or squark decay chains, and a number of studies have presented limits on the Drell-Yan production of charginos and neutralinos, this analysis obtains the most stringent limits to date on the production of charginos and neutralinos decaying to \u03c4 leptons in compressed-mass-spectrum scenarios defined by the mass separation \u2206m",
