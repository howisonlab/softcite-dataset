LFU can be violated in models beyond the SM by new physics particles that couple preferentially to certain generations of leptons. In the last few years, hints of LFU violation have been observed in both tree-level b \u2192 c \u03bd and loop-level b \u2192 s transitions. These measurements, combined with the tensions observed in angular observables and branching fractions of rare semileptonic b decays, point to a coherent pattern of anomalies that could soon turn into the first observation of physics beyond the SM. These proceedings review the anomalies seen by collider experiments, and give an outlook for the near future.",

The property that distinguishes the fundamental fermions from one another is called flavour. The universality of lepton flavour (LFU) is one of the most interesting consequences of the Standard Model (SM). LFU is an accidental symmetry, broken only by Yukawa interactions, and states that the electroweak gauge bosons couple with equal strength to the three families of leptons. This property is well established in decays of light mesons, e.g. K \u2192 \u03bd decays [1]. A violation of LFU would clearly indicate that new particles participate in quark flavour changing processes, modifying their dynamics.",

            "text": "In the SM, transitions between different quark flavours can only be mediated by the charged weak bosons W \u00b1 . As a consequence, flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transitions between same-charge quarks are not directly mediated by the neutral weak boson Z 0 , but rather occur through much rarer loop processes involving virtual W \u00b1 and additional virtual quarks, in penguin-and box-like Feynman diagrams. The SM predicts the dynamics of decays governed by FCNC transitions with very high precision. New particles can either participate in the loops, or generate additional tree-level diagrams. The amplitudes of suppressed decays governed by b \u2192 s transitions are ideal laboratories to look for New Physics (NP), as effects beyond the SM can be sizeable with respect to the competing SM processes. An intriguing set of anomalies emerged in recent years from the study of such amplitudes [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. In addition, tree-level decays of beauty mesons to final states with a \u03c4 lepton have been studied at BaBar [14,15], Belle [16][17][18] and LHCb [19,20]. In all cases, hints of a deviation from LFU were reported. A coherent picture emerges, with many NP models predicting particles with enhanced couplings to the second and third generation of quarks and leptons, see e.g. Refs. [21][22][23][24][25][26].",

The fact that this discrepancy has been observed both at B-factory experiments and at the LHC corroborates its significance. The Belle and BaBar experiments measured the semitauonic decay rate relative to the sum of e, \u00b5 modes. Due to the difficult reconstruction of electrons, LHCb only used the semimuonic channel as normalization. Whereas the B meson kinematics is completely known at B-factories, at the LHC the momenta of the colliding partons are unknown. Together with the presence of invisible neutrinos in the final state, this makes the measurement of semileptonic B decays very challenging at a hadron collider. Owing to the excellent resolution of its vertex detector, LHCb manages to reconstruct the flight direction and momentum of the decaying B meson with a resolution of about 18% [19]. The longitudinal boost of the B meson is assumed to be well approximated by that of the reconstructed meson-lepton pair.",

The relatively long \u03c4 lifetime is exploited to suppress background from prompt pions, i.e. B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 3\u03c0X. A multivariate approach is adopted to suppress background from decays with an additional charmed meson, using a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) [31]. The signal yield is determined with a three-dimensional fit to the \u03c4 proper decay time, the output of the BDT and q 2 . The bottom panels of Figure 2 show the result of the fit, highlighting the various contributions to the measured signal yield. The known branching fractions Br B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 (3\u03c0) + and Br B 0 \u2192 D * \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 are used to calculate R D * , which is measured to be R D * = 0.291 \u00b1 0.019 (stat) \u00b1 0.026 (syst) \u00b1 0.013 (ext), where the last uncertainty is due to the external input brancing fractions [20].

The LHCb experiment has provided experimental measurements of these quantities, laying out a common strategy for LFU tests with rare decays. The R X observables are defined as ratios of efficiency corrected yields limited to certain q 2 ranges, chosen in order to exclude the J/\u03c8 and \u03a8(2S) resonances, which are then used as control channels. Electron and muon channel yields are measured relative to the corresponding, much more abundant resonant modes B \u2192 XJ/\u03c8, where X is the strange meson under study and the J/\u03c8 meson decays to either a \u00b5\u00b5 or ee pair. This way, thanks to the topological similarity between the nonresonant and resonant modes, the systematic uncertainties related to the differences in the reconstruction of electron and muon tracks largely cancel. In order to test the validity of the analysis procedure, the efficiency corrected resonant yields are compared, and the important cross-check observable r J/\u03c8 \u2261 Br (B \u2192 XJ/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u00b5\u00b5)) / Br (B \u2192 XJ/\u03c8 (\u2192 ee)), expected to be unity, is measured. This way, the electron and muon reconstruction efficiencies, as well as the efficiency of the offline selection, are validated. The electron mode is much more challenging from an experimental point of view, and the low reconstruction efficiency for dielectron final states represents the dominant factor in the statistical uncertainty associated to the LHCb measurements.",

The latters comprise CPeven (S i ) and CP-odd (A i ) observables, and are sensitive to the C 9 and C 10 Wilson coefficients. A total of 15 parameters arise, due to the interplay between the vector (K * 0 ) and scalar contributions to the K\u03c0 system. From these parameters, optimized quantities P ( ) i can be constructed, for which the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 form factor uncertainties cancel at leading order. LHCb measured these angular parameters using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the three angular spectra, m(K\u03c0) and m(K\u03c0\u00b5\u00b5), and applying an independent method as a crosscheck [10]. This measurement is performed in q 2 ranges chosen in order to exclude charmonium resonances. The reconstructed B 0 mass is used to discriminate between signal and background, whereas the K\u03c0 mass distribution is exploited to separate vector and S-wave contributions. The fit results for a central q 2 bin are shown in Figure 5. Most observables are in good agreement with the SM. However, a significant tension (3.4\u03c3) is observed in the optimised observable P 5 . This tension has been registered also by the Belle [11] and ATLAS [12] experiments, although with larger uncertainties.

The large difference between tree-level and loop-level amplitudes, the significance and weight of the anomalies, and the fact that no deviations from theory have been observed so far in decays of light mesons prompted the physics community to develop NP models with particles that couple preferentially to the second and third generations, in a Yukawa-like hierarchy [21][22][23][24][25][26]. Direct searches for such new mediators have been performed at CMS [52,53] and ATLAS [54]; searches for lepton flavour violating decays, also predicted by such models, are reaching unprecedented sensitivities at hadron colliders [55][56][57][58].",

Measurements from the newly started Belle 2 run are also expected to shed light on the current anomalies, with the added reliability of a complementary experimental setup. For example, the LHCb uncertainty on the R D * ratio is expected to scale down about a factor 2 with the LHC Run 3, and Belle 2 will have enough data by then to provide an R D measurement with an uncertainty 2 to 3 times smaller than the current world average [59].
