They are fully consistent with the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment, but because of its low statistics cannot proof anything at this moment. It is no surprise that the statistics is still far from being able to test the signal claimed by the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment. The energy resolution of the coaxial detectors is a factor of 1.5 worse than in the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment. The original goal of background reduction to 10 \u22122 counts/kg y keV, or by an order of magnitude compared to the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment, has not been reached. The background is only a factor 2.3 lower if we refer it to the experimental line width, i.e. in units counts/kg y energy resolution.",

            "text": "The conclusion that the result of the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment (a signal at a 6.4 \u03c3 c.l. [1]) is refuted, is wrong. The reason is very simple. The authors of [6,7], compare their result to the line at (2038.1-2038.5)\u00b10.5(stat.)\u00b11.2(syst.) keV in the full (not PSA -treated) spectrum taken by HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW (exposure 71.7 kg y) see [9]. They ignore the result given in [1], that this line at Q \u03b2\u03b2 in the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment is a double line which cannot be resolved by the energy resolution of a Ge detector. Two lines of almost equal intensity occur at 2037.5 and 2039.3 keV. They can be separated, however, by pulse shape analysis (PSA), since the first one consists essentially of single site events as expected for a 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 line, the second essentially of multiple site events, as expected for a gamma line. Their intensities are 11.0\u00b11.8 and 10.3\u00b13.3, respectively, adding to the line found in the full (not PSA-treated) spectrum of 19.6\u00b15.4 events obtained after 51.39 kg y (the time during which the time structure of pulses has been recorded in the HEIDEL-BERG-MOSCOW experiment). The 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half life is consequently (2.23 +0.44 \u22120.31 ) \u00d7 10 25 years [1], and not (1.19 +0.38 \u22120.22 ) \u00d7 10 25 y as deduced in [9] from the full spectrum and as assumed in the GERDA report.",

It is, however, only by a factor of 2.3 smaller than HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW if we refer to the line width, i.e. in units of counts/kg y energy resolution. It is the latter value which defines the sensitivity of the experiment concerning background (without PSA).

The main point is that they do not show that all lines in the spectrum are understood. The spectra are shown in [6,7] -except for a range of \u223c 1900-2200 keV around Q \u03b2\u03b2 -only binned into energy bins of 5 keV. This is hardly adequate to an energy resolution of 4.8 keV. More critical, is that they compare most part of their spectra in a 30 keV binning to a background model averaging also over 30 keV. This means that for most part of the spectrum individual gamma lines are not shown and their intensities were not determined or at least are not listed. In this way the usual procedure of localizing the sources of radioactive impurities in the setup cannot be applied. Further, in such way it cannot be checked whether there exist lines in the spectrum not included in their background model. Strange is also, that they (their slide 55, from [6] ) exclude 'lines' at 2104 and 2119 keV from their background -at least the first of them being not visible. If the 2104 and 2119 keV lines are accepted as lines than there are m a n y lines in their 2 keV-binned spectrum to be accepted and to be explained.",

            "text": "Besides the strong 214 Bi line at 2204 keV, some lines of low statistics (between 1 and 2\u03c3) are indicated in the range around Q \u03b2\u03b2 (2000-2120 keV) at energies corresponding to 214 Bi lines (2016.7 keV, not resolvable from 2010.7 and 2021.9 keV Bi lines), 2052.9 keV, 2119 keV. A line at 2065 keV is not understood. Also a line at 2037.5 keV is indicated, not separable from 2034.5 and 2039.3 keV lines. Its intensity of 4.9\u00b13.8 counts is consistent with the expectation from HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW [1,2], which is (4.4\u00b11.0) counts, adding the expectations from the 2037.5 keV line and for half of the 2039.3 keV line (because of lower background of GERDA without PSD). In case GERDA would not see the 2039.3 keV line, the expected value from HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW would be 3.1\u00b10.8, both being fully consistent with the above given fit. Considering the number of events to be expected in the GERDA spectrum before PSD, in a region of 2 FWHM (4.6\u03c3) around 2037.5 keV, a value of 8.9\u00b11.8 events is expexted,with the background of 0.5 counts per keV determined by the fit in Fig.2. The observed value of events in this range is 10. So the present GERDA result is fully consistent with the result of HEIDEL-BERG-MOSCOW [1,2].    Fig. 3 shows the full GERDA spectrum (before PSA) with a binning of 4 keV. Two structures dominate the spectrum, a broad line at the location of the unresolved 214 Bi lines at 2010.7, 2016.7 and 2021.8 keV (known from the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment) [9], and a broad unresolved structure covering the range 2034 to 2040 keV, which includes the lines 2034.5, 2037.5 and 2039.3 keV known from HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW [1]. The fit yields for the second line E=2036.4\u00b12.5 keV and an intensity of 3.9\u00b13.0 events, consistent with the expectation (see above) of 4.4\u00b11.0 events. A word of caution: It should be mentioned, however, that different ways of 4 keV binning can give rather different result. Thus Figs. 2 and 3 show, that at the low statistics GERDA has at present, and with the low energy resolution the GERDA detectors have, at this moment it is premature and marginal to search for resolved lines in this region. The statistics of GERDA at present is simply not sufficient to check the result of the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment. But what is found, is consistent with the expectation from HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW [1,2].",
