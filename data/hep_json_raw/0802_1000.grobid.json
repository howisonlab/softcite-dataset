The selections rely on \u03c4 -jet or lepton (e, \u00b5) triggers. \u03c4 -identification based on vertex reconstruction and impact parameter measurements is powerful against hadronic jets. A single b-tag is sufficient to suppress events from Drell-Yan, QCD multi-jet and W+jets processes. Against the difficult tt background a central jet veto is applied. Missing transverse energy (E miss T ) reconstruction is important to account for the neutrinos from the Higgs or the \u03c4 decays. Top quark and W boson mass reconstruction provides a further handle on the background. For example, in the bbH/A, H/A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113 + jet searches, it is instrumental in vetoing leptons from W decay by reconstructing the transverse mass of the [lepton, E miss T ] system. The main background comes from tt events, with significant contribution from W+jets events in the H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 searches and Drell-Yan processes in the H/A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113 + jet searches. A major exception is the H/A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 jet jet analysis, where QCD events dominate the background. The typical selection efficiency is below 1%.",
