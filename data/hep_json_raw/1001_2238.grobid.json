Theoretical calculations for bottomonium are generally more reliable than for other qq systems due to the small relativistic corrections (v/c \u2248 0.1). However, much about the spectrum of bottomonium states remains unknown. Although potential models predict \u223c 26 bottomonium states to lie below the BB threshold (as illustrated in Fig. 1), only 10 of them had been identified since the discovery of bottomonium in 1977 [1] until 2008. Most importantly, the ground state \u03b7 b (1 1 S 0 ), had not been identified, despite many searches by CUSB [2] and CLEO [3] at CESR, and ALPEH [4] and DELPHI [5] at LEP, among others.",

We note that the small peak at E \u03b3 \u2248 920 MeV due to the radiative transition to \u03b7 b (1S) is not visible until the large smooth background is subtracted. BaBar's success is due not simply due to their large data set, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously collected at CLEO, but also due a factor 3 greater background suppression by the use of a cut on the \"thrust angle\". The thrust angle is defined as the angle between the signal transition photon candidate and the thrust axis of the rest of the event [8].",

Three features are immediately visible from these spectra. One, the spectra are dominated by a larger, smoothly varying background from other bottomonium decays and decays from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192lighter hadrons. Two, the visible peaks come from the unresolved transitions \u03c7 bJ (2P, 1P) \u2192 \u03b3\u03d2(1S), J = 0, 1, 2. Lastly, the peaks from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03d2(1S) and \u03d2(3S, 2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (1S) (with E \u03b3 (\u03b7 b ) \u2248 600 MeV for \u03d2(2S) and E \u03b3 (\u03b7 b ) \u2248 920 MeV for \u03d2(3S)) are expected to be more than an order of magnitude weaker than the \u03c7 bJ (2P, 1P) peaks, and they reside on the high energy tails of \u03c7 bJ (2P, 1P).  Photon Line Shapes: Photon line shapes in crystal calorimeters, like those used by CLEO, are generally parameterized in terms of the Crystal Ball function. This function combines a Gaussian (width \u03c3 ), with a low-energy power law tail (parameters \u03b1 and n). Knowing the shape of the low energy tail is especially important for the \u03c7 bJ peaks, since they are important in determing the shape of the background at the energy of the small \u03b7 b signal. These parameters must be determined by fitting a background-free photon peak. In our analysis we use two independent methods. In one method, we use the observed shape of photons from a given energy from radiative Bhabha events, and in the other we use the shape of photons from the excusive decays \u03c7 b1 (2P, 1P) \u2192 \u03b3\u03d2(1S), \u03d2(1S) \u2192 l + l \u2212 .

We made several hundred background fits to the data in each of three bins of | cos \u03b8 T |, using exponential polynomials of various orders (2,3,4), in various energy regions (500-1340 MeV), and with linear and logarithmic binning of the data. We found that many of these fit the data acceptably, and took as our final results the average of E \u03b3 (\u03b7 b ), B(\u03d2(nS) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b ), and significance for all the good fits (CL> 10%). The r.m.s. variation of these fits was then taken as a measure of the systematic uncertainty in the results from this source, \u00b11 MeV in E \u03b3 , \u00b110% in B(\u03b7 b ), and \u00b10.4\u03c3 in significance.  Joint Analysis in Three Bins of | cos \u03b8 T |: As Fig. 4 (left) shows, the distribution of thrust angle (| cos \u03b8 T |) for the background-dominated data is strongly peaked in the forward direction, but for the transition photon to the \u03b7 b , the distribution is expected to be uniform. This happens because the transition photon is uncorrelated with the particles produced by the decay of the \u03b7 b , whereas the background photons tend to be correlated with the other particles produced in the underlying event. We therefore define three different regions of | cos \u03b8 T |: region I (| cos \u03b8 T | = 0 \u2212 0.3), region II (| cos \u03b8 T | = 0.3 \u2212 0.7), and region III (| cos \u03b8 T | = 0.7 \u2212 1.0)).

We further note that although we quote an uncertainty in photon energy calibration of \u00b11.2 MeV, the energies of the ISR peak and the \u03c7 bJ (2P) centroid agree with their expected energies within \u00b10.3 MeV. The analysis method described for \u03d2(3S) was also used for our \u03d2(2S) data. Because the background near the expected \u03d2(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (1S) signal (E \u03b3 \u2248 610 MeV) is approximately 6 times higher than the corresponding \u03d2(3S) (see Fig. 3) transition, no evidence for the excitation of \u03b7 b was observed in any | cos \u03b8 T | bin, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The joint analysis led to an upper limit of B(\u03d2(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b ) < 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , at 90% confidence level.",
