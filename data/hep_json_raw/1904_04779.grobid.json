            "text": "Since the famous spin crisis that began in 1987, the problem of the nucleon spin structure remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in the contemporary high-energy physics. The central component of this problem, attracting for many years enormous both theoretical and experimental efforts, is the problem how the spin of the nucleon is built up of spins and orbital angular momenta of its constituents. The searches brought up a concept of the parton distribution functions of the nucleon, at first only two were proposed: f 1 for unpolarized and g 1 for polarized nucleons. Now we know that there must be of about 50 different parton distribution functions for a complete description of the nucleon structure. The most general of them is the Wigner function containing all full information about the longitudinal and transverse spin and momentum partonic degrees of freedom. The averaging over some variables or putting some other to particular (zero) values leads to more simple and more easily measurable description of fundamental particles, quarks and gluons, inside hadrons. The important stage of this reduced description is the set of Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Parton Distributions (TMD PDFs) and the reduction process finishes when the most familiar collinear parton distributions appear.",

The authors of the work [14] pointed out that A \u03b3 N at large positive x F is dominated by quark-gluon correlations while at large negative x F it is dominated by pure gluon-gluon correlations as it was concluded in [15]. The study of prompt-photon production at large transverse momentum with longitudinally polarized proton beams could provide the access to gluon polarization \u2206g, which is known from previous measurements to be of about zero with large uncertainties, via the measurement of longitudinal double spin asymmetry A \u03b3 LL [16]. Unpolarized measurements of the differential cross section of prompt-photon production in protonproton collisions at SPD is also interesting since there is a significant disagreement between the theoretical expectations and the experimental results in the fixed-target experiments at \u221a s \u223c 20 GeV [17].

The analogy is correct if the J/\u03c8 interactions with quarks and leptons are of the vector type. This analogy is known as the duality model [18,19]. For the TMD PDFs studies, the duality model can predict [20] a similar behavior of the azimuthal asymmetries in the lepton pair's production via Drell-Yan and via the J/\u03c8 leptonic decay This similarity stems from the idea of the duality model to replace the coupling e 2 q by the J/\u03c8 vector coupling with qq (g V q ) 2 . The vector couplings are expected to be the same for u and d quarks [18] and cancel out in the azimuthal asymmetries for large values of x 1 or x 2 .

The detector consists of the three parts: barrel and two end-caps. Each part has individual magnetic system. The toroidal field should provide tracking capability in the barrel part while the end-caps will be equipped by the solenoidal coils. Such configuration of the magnetic system should minimize the magnetic field in the beam interaction region that is especially important for transversely polarized beams and provide the field integral of about 1 T\u2022m for measurement of the momentum of secondary charged particles. The planned length of the detector along the beam axis is 9.2 m while the diameter is 3.4 m.",

Time-of-flight system (TOF) will provide identification of secondary hadrons in the wide kinematic range. Low material budget of the central part of the setup is important for transparency of the detector for photons and minimization of the multiple scattering effects. The shashlyk-type electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) is responsible for the photon reconstruction. It will be the main element for the prompt phonon part of the physics programme. The range (muon) system (RS), the main detector for the Drell-Yan and charmonia part of the programme, should perform the advanced muon identification via muonic pattern recognition and further matching of the track segments to the tracks in the inner part of the detector.",

These measurements will provide access to all leading twist TMD PDFs of quarks and anti-quarks in nucleons. The measurements of asymmetries in production of charmonia and prompt photons, which supply complimentary information on the nucleon structure, will be performed in parallel. The Spin Physics Detector is planned to be a universal detector for a wide range of physics tasks. More detailed information about the SPD project could be found in the Letter of Intent [1] and the preliminary version of the Conceptual Design Report [21].",
