            "text": "Following the observation [1,2] of a Higgs boson, H, with a mass of approximately 125 GeV [3] by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the properties of its interactions with the electroweak gauge bosons have been measured extensively [4][5][6]. The coupling of the Higgs boson to leptons has been established through the observation of the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel [4,7,8], while in the quark sector indirect evidence is available for the coupling of the Higgs boson to the top-quark [4] and evidence for the Higgs boson decays into bb has been recently presented [9,10]. Despite this progress, the Higgs boson interaction with the fermions of the first and second generations is still to be confirmed experimentally. In the Standard Model (SM), Higgs boson interactions to fermions are implemented through Yukawa couplings, while a wealth of beyond-the-SM theories predict substantial modifications. Such scenarios include the Minimal Flavour Violation framework [11], the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism [12], the Higgs-dependent Yukawa couplings model [13], the Randall-Sundrum family of models [14], and the possibility of the Higgs boson being a composite pseudo-Goldstone boson [15]. An overview of relevant models of new physics is provided in ref. [16].",

Rare exclusive decays of the Higgs boson into a light meson, M , and a photon, \u03b3, have been suggested as a probe of the couplings of the Higgs boson to light quarks and would allow a search for potential deviations from the SM prediction [23,25,26]. Specifically, the observation of the Higgs boson decay to a \u03c6 or \u03c1(770) (denoted as \u03c1 in the following) meson and a photon would provide sensitivity to its couplings to the strange-quark, and the upand down-quarks, respectively. The expected SM branching fractions are B (H \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3) = (2.31 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22126 and B (H \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3) = (1.68 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [23]. The decay amplitude receives two main contributions that interfere destructively. The first is referred to as \"direct\" and proceeds through the H \u2192 qq coupling, where subsequently a photon is emitted before the qq hadronises exclusively to M . The second is referred to as \"indirect\" and proceeds via the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 coupling followed by the fragmentation \u03b3 * \u2192 M . In the SM, owing to the smallness of the light-quark Yukawa couplings, the latter amplitude dominates, despite being loop induced. As a result, the expected branching fraction predominantly arises from the \"indirect\" process, while the Higgs boson couplings to the light quarks are probed by searching for modifications of this branching fraction due to changes in the \"direct\" amplitude.",

The corresponding efficiencies for the \u03c1\u03b3 final state are 10% and 0.4%. The difference in efficiency between the Higgs and Z boson decays arises primarily from the softer p T distributions of the photon and charged-hadron candidates associated with the Z \u2192 M \u03b3 production, as can be seen for the \u03c6\u03b3 case by comparing figures 1(a) and 1(b). The overall lower efficiency in the \u03c1\u03b3 final state is a result of the lower efficiency of the m M requirement due to the large \u03c1-meson natural width and the different kinematics of the \u03c1 decay products, as presented in figures 1(c) and 1(d). Meson helicity effects have a relatively small impact for the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays, where the kaons carry very little momentum in the \u03c6 rest frame. Specifically, the expected Higgs (Z) boson signal yield in the signal region is 6% larger (9% smaller) than in the hypothetical scenario where the meson is unpolarised.

The dashed histograms are normalised to unity, and the relative difference between the two sets of distributions corresponds to the effects of reconstruction, trigger, and event selection efficiencies. The leading charged-hadron candidate h = K, \u03c0 is denoted by p h1",

The observed 95% CL upper limits on the branching fractions for H \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 and Z \u2192 \u03c6 \u03b3 decays are 208 and 87 times the expected SM branching fractions, respectively. The corresponding values for the \u03c1\u03b3 decays are 52 and 597 times the expected SM branching fractions, respectively. Upper limits at 95% CL on the production cross section times branching fraction are also estimated for the Higgs boson decays, yielding 25.3 fb for the H \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 decay, and 45.5 fb for the H \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 decay. The systematic uncertainties described in section 6 result in a 14% deterioration of the post-fit expected 95% CL upper limit on the branching fraction in the H \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 and Z \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 analyses, compared to the result including only statistical uncertainties. For the \u03c1\u03b3 analysis the systematic uncertainties result in a 2.3% increase in the post-fit expected upper limit for the Higgs boson decay, while for the Z boson decay the upper limit deteriorates by 29%.",

The \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays are reconstructed from pairs of oppositely charged-hadron candidates; the candidate with the higher p T , referred to as the leading charged-hadron candidate, is required to have p T > 20 GeV.Pairs of charged-hadron candidates are selected based on their invariant masses. Those with an invariant mass, under the charged-kaon hypothesis, m K + K \u2212 between 1012 MeV and 1028 MeV are selected as \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 candidates. Pairs with an invariant mass, under the charged-pion hypothesis, m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 between 635 MeV and 915 MeV are selected as \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates. The candidates where m K + K \u2212 is consistent with the \u03c6 meson mass are rejected from the \u03c1\u03b3 analysis. This requirement rejects a negligible fraction of the signal in the \u03c1\u03b3 analysis. Selected M candidates are required to satisfy an isolation requirement: the sum of the p T of the reconstructed ID tracks from the primary vertex within \u2206R = 0.2 of the leading charged hadron candidate (excluding the charged-hadron candidates defining the pair) is required to be less than 10% of the p T of the M candidate.The M candidates are combined with the photon candidates, to form M \u03b3 candidates. When multiple combinations are possible, a situation that arises only in a few percent of the events, the combination of the highest-p T photon and the M candidate with an invariant mass closest to the respective meson mass is selected. The event is retained for further analysis if the requirement \u2206\u03c6(M, \u03b3) > \u03c0/2 is satisfied. The transverse momentum of the M candidates is required to be greater than a threshold that varies as a function of the invariant mass of the three-body system, m M \u03b3 . Thresholds of 40 GeV and 47.2 GeV are imposed on p M T for the regions m M \u03b3 < 91 GeV and m M \u03b3 \u2265 140 GeV, respectively. The threshold is varied from 40 GeV to 47.2 GeV as a linear function of m M \u03b3 in the region 91 \u2264 m M \u03b3 < 140 GeV. This approach ensures good sensitivity for both the Higgs and Z boson searches, while keeping a single kinematic selection. -6 -",
