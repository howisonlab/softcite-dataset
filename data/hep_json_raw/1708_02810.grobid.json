The protonproton collision data were produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The inclusive fiducial cross section in the H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4 decay channel is measured to be 3.62 \u00b1 0.50 (stat) +0.25   \u22120.20 (sys) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 2.91 \u00b1 0.13 fb. The cross section is also extrapolated to the total phase space including all Standard Model Higgs boson decays. Several differential fiducial cross sections are measured for observables sensitive to the Higgs boson production and decay, including kinematic distributions of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson. Good agreement is found between data and Standard Model predictions. The results are used to put constraints on anomalous Higgs boson interactions with Standard Model particles, using the pseudo-observable extension to the kappa-framework.",

The combined effect of a higher centre-of-mass energy and an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 is expected to increase the number of Higgs boson events by a factor JHEP10(2017)132 of almost four compared to the previous analysis at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Significantly larger gains are expected in the regions of the differential distributions that probe higher momentum scales due to increased parton-parton luminosities. The differential cross sections presented in this paper are measured in a fiducial phase space to avoid model-dependent extrapolations. The observed distributions are corrected for detector inefficiency and resolution.",

Differential fiducial cross sections are presented for various observables that describe Higgs boson production and decay in pp collisions. They are inclusive in the different final states and Higgs boson production mechanisms, such as gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) or vector-boson fusion (VBF). The Higgs boson transverse momentum 1 p T,4 can be used to test perturbative QCD calculations, especially when separated into exclusive jet multiplicities. This variable is also sensitive to the Lagrangian structure of the Higgs boson interactions [13]. The Higgs boson rapidity distribution |y 4 | is sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding protons. The decay variables |cos \u03b8 * | and m 34 test the spin and parity of the Higgs boson. The variable |cos \u03b8 * | is defined as the magnitude of the cosine of the decay angle of the leading lepton pair in the four-lepton rest frame with respect to the beam axis. The variables m 12 and m 34 refer to the invariant masses of the leading and subleading lepton pairs and correspond to the invariant masses of the on-shell and off-shell Z bosons produced in the Higgs boson decay. The number of jets N jets produced in association with the Higgs boson and the transverse momentum p lead.jet T of the leading jet both provide sensitivity to the theoretical modelling of high-p T quark and gluon emission. The invariant mass m jj of the two leading jets in the event is sensitive to different production mechanisms. The signed angle between the two leading jets in the transverse plane 2 \u2206\u03c6 jj is another observable that tests the spin and parity of the Higgs boson [14].",

The silicon-based detectors cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The gas-filled strawtube transition radiation tracker complements the silicon tracker at larger radii up to |\u03b7| < 2 and also provides electron identification capabilities based on transition radiation. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with accordion geometry. The calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end-cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5 it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. A thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in upstream energy losses. A hadronic calorimeter in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers and scintillator tiles as the active medium. A liquid-argon calorimeter with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic endcap calorimeters, which covers the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A forward calorimeter using copper or tungsten absorbers with liquid argon completes the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer (MS) measures the deflection of muon trajectories within |\u03b7| < 2.7, using three layers of precision drift tube chambers, with cathode strip chambers in the innermost layer for |\u03b7| > 2.0. The deflection is provided by a toroidal magnetic field from air-core superconducting magnets. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T\u2022m across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer is instrumented with trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. Events are selected using a first-level trigger implemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event rate to a maximum of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1 kHz [20].",

The ggF Higgs boson production is accurate to NNLO in QCD, using the Powheg method for merging the NLO Higgs boson plus jet cross section with the parton shower, and the MiNLO method [60,61] to simultaneously achieve NLO accuracy for inclusive Higgs boson production. Furthermore, a reweighting procedure is performed using the HNNLO program [62][63][64] to achieve full NNLO accuracy [65]. This sample is referred to as NNLOPS. The VBF and V H samples are produced at NLO accuracy in QCD. For V H, the MiNLO method is used to merge zero-and one-jet events. For Higgs boson production in association with a heavy quark pair, events are simulated at NLO with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO (v.2.2.3 for ttH and v.2.3.3 for bbH [66]) [67], using the CT10nlo PDF set [68] for ttH and the NNPDF23 PDF set [69] for bbH. For the ggF, VBF, V H, and bbH production mechanisms, Pythia 8 [70,71] is used for the H \u2192 ZZ * \u2192 4 decay as well as for parton showering, hadronization, and multiple partonic interactions using the AZNLO parameter set [72]. For the ttH production mechanism, Herwig++ [73,74] is used with the UEEE5 parameter set [75].",

The HRes program computes fixed-order cross sections for ggF SM Higgs boson production up to NNLO in QCD and describes the p T,4 distribution at NLO. All-order resummation of soft-gluon effects at small transverse momenta is consistently included up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order (NNLL) in QCD, using dynamic factorization and resummation scales (the central scales are chosen to be m H /2). The program implements top quark and bottom quark mass dependence up to next-to-leading logarithmic order (NNL) + NLO in QCD. At NNLL + NNLO accuracy only the top quark contribution is considered.

They are required to satisfy loose identification criteria based on tracking and calorimeter information. Muons are reconstructed as tracks in the ID and the MS [107] if they lie in the region 0.1 < |\u03b7| < 2.5. In the region |\u03b7| < 0.1, the MS has reduced coverage, and muons are reconstructed from ID tracks and identified by either a minimal energy deposit in the calorimeter or hits in the MS.

            "text": "Higgs boson candidates are formed by selecting two same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs, called a lepton quadruplet. The analysis selection proceeds in parallel for the four final states (4\u00b5, 2e2\u00b5, 2\u00b52e, 4e, where the first two leptons refer to the leading lepton pair). The leading pair is defined as the SFOS pair with the mass m 12 closest to the Z boson mass and the subleading pair is defined as the SFOS pair with the mass m 34 second closest to the Z boson mass. Mispairing within a quadruplet occurs for about 1% of the selected events for the 4\u00b5 or 4e final states. Furthermore, a quadruplet can be formed with an extra lepton originating from the W/Z for V H or ttH production, moving m 4 away from m H . The expected rate for V H or ttH with leptonic decays is about 0.3% of all Higgs events in the full m 4 range after the event selection. For each final state, a quadruplet is chosen in which the three leading leptons pass p T (E T ) > 20, 15, 10 GeV. In addition to the dilepton mass, lepton separation and J/\u03c8 veto requirements (given in table 1), loose calorimeter-and track-based isolation as well as impact parameter requirements are imposed on the leptons. For the track-based isolation, the sum of the p T of the tracks lying within a cone of size \u2206R = min[0.3, 10 GeV/p T ] (min[0.2, 10 GeV/E T ]) around the muon (electron) is required to be smaller than 15% of the lepton p T (E T ). Similarly, the sum of the calorimeter E T deposits in a cone of size \u2206R = 0.2 around the muon (electron) is required to be smaller than 30% (20%) of the lepton p T (E T ). As the four leptons should originate from a common vertex, a requirement on the \u03c7 2 value of a common vertex fit is applied, corresponding to a signal efficiency of 99.5% for all decay channels. If more than one quadruplet passes all requirements, e.g. for V H or ttH, the channel with the JHEP10(2017)132 highest expected signal rate after reconstruction and event selection is selected, in the order: 4\u00b5, 2e2\u00b5, 2\u00b52e and 4e. In order to improve the four-lepton mass reconstruction, the reconstructed final-state radiation (FSR) photons in Z boson decays are accounted for using the same strategy as in the Run-1 data analysis [112]. The invariant mass distribution of the four leptons of the selected events is shown in figure 1. Only events with a four-lepton invariant mass in the range 115-130 GeV are used in the extraction of the signal.",

The term N i,reco is the number of reconstructed signal events and N i,part is the number of events at the particle level in the fiducial phase-space. The correction factor is calculated from simulated Higgs boson samples, assuming SM production mode fractions and ZZ * \u2192 4 decay fractions as discussed in section 3. The systematic uncertainties in this assumption are described in section 9. The correction factors for the different Higgs boson production modes agree within 15%, except for the ttH mode, which differs by up to 40%, due to the fact that ttH events have more hadronic jets and that no isolation requirements are applied to the leptons at the particle level. The correction factors for the four final states are 0.64 \u00b1 0.04 (4\u00b5), 0.55 \u00b1 0.03 (2e2\u00b5), 0.48 \u00b1 0.05 (2\u00b52e), and 0.43 \u00b1 0.06 (4e). Figure 6 shows the bin-by-bin correction factors for all decay channels combined including systematic uncertainties for the p T,4 and N jets distributions. The large uncertainty for N jets \u2265 3 is due to the experimental jet reconstruction uncertainties and the variations of the fractions of Higgs boson production modes (see section 9). The same figure also shows the bin purity, defined as the fraction of events in a bin of the   reconstructed distribution that are found in the same bin at particle level. The bin purity is greater than 0.75 for the Higgs boson kinematic and decay observables, and typically greater than 0.6 for the jet variables. It can be seen that the narrower bins at low p T,4 have a slightly reduced bin purity, as detector resolution effects result in larger bin migration effects, which is enhanced by the presence of a steep slope.  The signal, background, and data m 4 distributions, as well as the correction factors, are used as input to a profile-likelihood-ratio fit [114], taking into account all bins of a given distribution and all final states for the inclusive measurement. The likelihood includes the shape and normalization uncertainties of the backgrounds and correction factors as nuisance parameters.

The compatibility of a measured cross section and a theoretical prediction is evaluated by computing a p-value based on the difference between the value of \u22122 ln \u039b at the best-fit value and the value obtained by fixing the cross sections in all bins to the ones predicted by the theory. These p-values do not include the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions, which are significantly smaller than the total data uncertainties. Therefore, they are slightly smaller than they would be with all uncertainties included. For all measured observables the asymptotic assumption is verified with pseudo-experiments, and if necessary, the uncertainties are corrected to the values obtained with the pseudo-experiments.

In this paper, the couplings related to the contact interaction of the Higgs boson decay are considered, \u03b5 L and \u03b5 R , which modify, in a flavour-universal way, the contact terms between the Higgs boson, the Z boson, and left-or right-handed leptons. Since the contact terms have the same Lorentz structure as the SM term, they only affect the dilepton invariant mass spectra, while the lepton angular distributions are not modified. The difference in \u03c7 2 between the measured and predicted cross sections in the m 12 vs m 34 observable plane is therefore used to constrain the possible contributions from contact interactions. It was checked with pseudo experiments that the \u03c7 2 distribution agrees with the hypothesis of two degrees of freedom. Assuming the SM values for all but the tested parameters, limits are set on the contact-interaction coupling strength as shown in figure 11. Two parameter planes are considered: \u03b5 L vs \u03b5 R , as well as \u03b5 L vs \u03ba, where \u03ba is the coupling of the Higgs boson to the Z bosons and \u03b5 R = 0.48 \u2022 \u03b5 L [81]. Since the addition of the contact terms changes the Higgs boson production rate, in principle limits could be set based on the inclusive Higgs boson cross sections alone. In this case, the obtained allowed area in figure 11(a) would be circular, but the addition of the invariant mass spectra improves the sensitivity, especially for negative \u03b5 L and positive \u03b5 R . The addition of the shape information also improves the limit in the \u03b5 L vs \u03ba parameter plane. It can be seen that the expected and observed limits are slightly shifted with respect to each other, but no significant deviation is observed.",
