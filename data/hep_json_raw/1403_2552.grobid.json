            "text": "The T2K experiment has reported the first observation of the appearance of electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam. The main and irreducible background to the appearance signal comes from the presence in the neutrino beam of a small intrinsic component of electron neutrinos originating from muon and kaon decays. In T2K, this component is expected to represent 1.2% of the total neutrino flux. A measurement of this component using the near detector (ND280), located 280 m from the target, is presented. The charged current interactions of electron neutrinos are selected by combining the particle identification capabilities of both the time projection chambers and electromagnetic calorimeters of ND280. The measured ratio between the observed electron neutrino beam component and the prediction is 1.01 AE 0.10 providing a direct confirmation of the neutrino fluxes and neutrino cross section modeling used for T2K neutrino oscillation analyses. Electron neutrinos coming from muons and kaons decay are also separately measured, resulting in a ratio with respect to the prediction of 0.68 AE 0.30 and 1.10 AE 0.14, respectively.",

The spill consists of 8 bunches (6 during the first data-taking period), each 15 ns wide. The protons strike a 91.4 cm long graphite target, producing hadrons, mainly pions and kaons. The positively charged particles are focused by a series of three magnetic horns operating at 250 kA before entering a 96 m long decay volume where they decay producing mainly muon neutrinos. A small fraction of the kaons, and the muons produced by pion decay, can also decay producing electron neutrinos. Most of the surviving charged particles are stopped in a beam dump at the end of the decay volume. A muon monitor (MUMON) situated downstream of the beam dump measures the profile of high energy muons not stopped by the beam dump, monitoring the stability of the beam intensity and the direction of the beam. The neutrinos are sampled 280 m and 295 km from the target, at the ND280 near detector and SK far detector, respectively.",

            "text": "In the T2K simulation the interaction of the primary proton beam and the propagation of secondary particles in the carbon target are simulated with FLUKA [16]. The flux prediction is based on the hadron production measurements performed by NA61/SHINE, a fixed target experiment at the CERN SPS in which a proton beam of the same energy as the T2K beam interacts with a thin carbon target (2 cm long) or with a T2K replica target (91.4 cm long) [17]. The charged hadrons produced in the proton-carbon interactions are tracked by a system of TPCs, and their production cross sections as functions of momentum and angle are measured. The NA61/SHINE measurements cover most of the relevant hadron production phase space for the T2K flux. The observed production cross section of pions [18] and kaons [19] on the thin target are used in the T2K flux simulation to reduce the uncertainties on the flux prediction [4]. Measurements from other experiments (Eichten et al. [20] and Allaby et al. [21]) are used to reduce the uncertainty of the particle production in the region not covered by NA61/SHINE. The propagation of particles through the elements of the beam line is simulated with GEANT3 [22]. The particles are propagated through the horns' magnetic field and may interact with the surrounding materials. Particle decays into neutrinos are simulated as well as the interactions in the decay volume and the beam dump. The modeling of hadronic interactions is done using the GCALOR model [23]. The beam direction, its intensity and the beam profile are measured by the INGRID and MUMON detectors. The neutrino fluxes are described by a covariance matrix in bins of neutrino energy and type. The uncertainty on the \u03bd \u03bc flux is below 12% for neutrino energies around 0.6 GeV. The expected \u03bd e flux and its uncertainty at ND280 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Most of the intrinsic beam \u03bd e component comes from the decay of \u03bc \u00fe (\u03bc \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd e ) produced by the pions' decay and from charged and neutral kaons. The charged kaons produce \u03bd e via the decays K \u00fe \u2192 \u03c0 0 e \u00fe \u03bd e that have a branching ratio of 5.1%, while the neutral kaons produce\u03bd e through the decays K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e \u00fe \u03bd e have a branching ratio of 40.5%. The \u03bd e from muon decays contribute to most of the flux in the low energy region, below 1.5 GeV, while above that energy almost all of the \u03bd e flux comes from kaon decays. The \u03bd e from pion decays only contribute to about 1% of the total \u03bd e flux ( Fig. 1). A more detailed discussion of the uncertainties contributing to the \u03bd e flux ( Fig. 2) can be found in [4]. As the physics processes leading to \u03bd e from muon decay and from kaon decay are different, the analysis presented in this paper extracts a measurement of their separate contributions to the flux, as well as the inclusive flux of \u03bd e .",

The strategy that is chosen in T2K analyses is to allow the ND280 \u03bd \u03bc CC samples to constrain this parameter, including a large prior uncertainty (\u03c3 M QE A \u00bc 0.43 GeV) to account for the difference between the NEUT nominal value and the NEUT best fit to the MiniBooNE data. Additional degrees of freedom are allowed by three independent CCQE normalization factors (x QE 1;2;3 ) for different neutrino energy ranges.

The other two normalization factors, x QE 2 for 1.5 < E \u03bd < 3.5 GeV and x QE 3 for E \u03bd > 3.5 GeV are given a prior uncertainty of 30% to account for the discrepancy between MiniBooNE and NOMAD data [33].",

The selection is done by requiring one and only one track in a bunch with negative charge crossing all the 3 TPCs and starting at the upstream edge of the P0D. The TPC PID of the selected track must be compatible with a muon in the TPC upstream of the first FGD (TPC1). This requirement does not bias the sample since the TPC1 PID is not used in the analysis. Once a clean sample of muons is selected from the data, the muon misidentification probability is computed as the ratio between the number of tracks passing the PID selection and all the selected tracks. The same PID selections described in Sec. IV for the cases with and without ECal information are used. In Fig. 12 the misidentification probability as a function of the track momentum measured in the TPC is shown. The muon misidentification probability is below 1% for all the momenta and is much smaller if the TPC and the ECal PID are combined. Compatible results are obtained using simulated data confirming that the PID performances of ND280 detectors are well understood and well reproduced in the simulation.",

The larger systematic uncertainty for R\u00f0\u03bd e \u00f0\u03bc\u00de\u00de is due to the fact that the detector, flux and cross section systematic uncertainties are larger at low momenta. The distribution of the reconstructed electron momentum for the three samples after the fit are shown in Fig. 16. As far as the nuisance parameters are concerned, the fitted values are in good agreement with the expectations. The out of FGD electron component is reduced in the fit by 0.64 AE 0.10, compatible with the prior systematic uncertainty of 30%. This reduction might point to the fact that the simulation does not properly reproduce the amount of \u03c0 0 produced in neutrino interactions in the materials surrounding the ND280 tracker region. Those interactions are mainly high energy deep inelastic scattering events for which the \u03c0 0 multiplicity is not well measured. This reduction does not have a large impact on the measurements presented here because of the presence of the photon conversion sample used to evaluate this background.",
