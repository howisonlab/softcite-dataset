This energy range is of particular interest to ongoing and future neutrino oscillation searches in MINOS, NOA [6], and T2K [7]. Most cross section measurements in the E < 30 GeV range [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] have uncertainties of the order of 10%. Recently, NOMAD [15] measured the cross section down to 2.5 GeV with a precision of better than 4%. However, this result relies on a particle production model tuned to data [16] to predict the neutrino flux. In this paper we present a measurement of the N CC cross section with a precision from 2%-8%, covering the 3-50 GeV energy range using the MINOS near detector. Our analysis uses a low hadronic energy subsample to determine the flux shape [17,18].",

In between beam spills, cosmic ray muon data are recorded with less than 1% dead time. The detector is calibrated in several steps that convert the raw PMT signal to deposited energy [28]. The nonlinearity of the electronics is measured with charge injection; relative PMT gains are measured with an in situ light injection system; variations in the light output between scintillator strips and along the strips are corrected with cosmic ray muons and a radioactive source scanner. Cosmic ray muons which stop in the detector are used to calibrate the measured signal to energy lost by muons passing through the scintillator strips.

This is assessed by comparing the energy measured with curvature to the independent measurement from range using tracks that stop in the detector, and by folding in underlying uncertainties in the detector's magnetic field [41]. The resolution for muon momentum measured from range is 5% while that measured from curvature has non-Gaussian tails and width of approximately 10%.",

In the plane transverse to the detector axis, the vertex is required to be more than 0.5 m from the edge of an active scintillator plane and outside of a 0.8 m radius centered at the coil hole. The outline of the fiducial region is shown in Fig. 2. 2Coil hole: The coil hole is uninstrumented and variations in the material composition and magnetic field are somewhat larger in the region around it. To reduce the effect of these uncertainties, events with tracks that spend a significant fraction of their path length near the hole are removed from the event sample. A minimum of 95% of hit strips in the event is required to be farther than 0.3 m from the center at closest approach (see Fig. 2). (3) Track energy: The energy of the muon must be greater than 1.5 GeV. This requirement rejects neutral-current (NC) background events, which populate the low-energy region, and short, poorly reconstructed tracks. (4) Track quality: The track fitting procedure yields a measurement of the muon momentum with an associated uncertainty. The track fit is required to be convergent and have an uncertainty of less than 30%. In addition, we require the track's longitudinal start positions in each view to be less than six planes apart. (5) Neutrino energy: The reconstructed neutrino energy, E, which is the sum of the track and shower energies, is required to be greater than 3 GeV (5 GeV) for the neutrino (antineutrino) sample and less than 50 GeV. The minimum energy requirements are imposed to minimize the overlap of the inclusive CC sample and the flux sample, which is substantial below these values. Above the maximum energy cut, resolution of the track momentum measurement from curvature degrades as the tracks become straighter. The event sample is divided into two categories depending on whether the track stops in or exits the detector. For exiting events, the muon leaves the detector through the back or side, or passes into the uninstrumented coil hole region. The stopping and exiting samples are further differentiated based on whether they end in the upstream or downstream region (see Fig. 2) because of the difference in sampling in the two regions.",

An angle is defined in the transverse plane by forming a straight line from the extrapolated track end point in absence of a magnetic field to the observed track end point, and a line from the magnet coil hole center to the observed interaction point [41]. For a particle bending toward the coil, this angle will be near rad, while for a defocused \u00fe it will be near 0 or 2 rad. For the antineutrino sample, we select a value for this angle less than 1.04 rad or greater than 5.24 rad. (2) Number of hit planes: We keep events in which the difference in the number of hit planes along the track between the two views is less than five. Events which are rejected by this cut usually enter the uninstrumented region in one view yielding an unreliable determination of the charge sign. Downstream exiting tracks: Only events with tracks that exit the detector in the downstream region are used for the antineutrino analysis. The rejected samples have high contamination from NC and misidentified CC (wrong-sign) events. Table I shows the effect of the selection criteria on the neutrino and the antineutrino reconstructed samples. The minimum track energy cut has the largest effect, resulting in an approximately 30% loss in the sample and 60% in the \" sample. The cut removes primarily NC events, which arise from both neutrinos and antineutrinos, and therefore affects the smaller \" sample more. The track quality cut also has a larger effect on the \" sample.

The decrease in acceptance at low energy is due to the minimum muon energy requirement. For neutrinos, the shape below 10 GeV is determined by the geometry of the detector and overlap of the stopping and exiting samples, which have different resolutions. The contributions from each subsample are also shown in Fig. 3.",

Figure 6 and Table II show the extracted neutrino and antineutrino fluxes in the selected fiducial volume after normalization. The systematic uncertainties on the extracted flux are discussed in Sec. IV. We correct the input flux model shown in Fig. 1 by reweighting the simulation with the ratio of the extracted flux to the original simulated flux. The resulting corrections to the initial simulated flux are consistent with those obtained by a different technique [27] used for the MINOS oscillation analyses. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the CC data sample and Monte Carlo simulation before and after flux reweighting is applied for the measured kinematic variables: the muon energy, hadronic shower energy, and muon track angle with respect to the beam direction. The agreement between Monte Carlo and data in all three distributions is significantly improved after the flux reweighting has been applied.",

In this data set, muon tracks pass through a different region of the detector and previously focused tracks bend away from the coil region. The flux and cross section are extracted and are compared with their values measured in the nominal mode. The flux sample relies more heavily on the muon track measurement than does the cross section sample and consequently larger effects are seen in the measured flux (on average 5% for neutrino and 2.5% for antineutrino flux). Smaller differences are expected for the antineutrino sample because more of the tracks exit the detector in the downstream region and do not pass near the difficult-tomodel coil region in either mode. A systematic uncertainty on the nominal polarity flux is taken to be half the difference between it and the flux extracted in the reversed polarity sample.

II C. We account for uncertainties in the quasielastic and resonance contributions to the cross section by varying the axial mass parameters M QE A and M RES A in our model by AE15%. The resulting effect on the cross section is less than 2%. In this measurement, we include an additional uncertainty in the DIS component of the model to account for contributions to the dependence of the cross section that could affect the flux extraction. To quantify the resulting uncertainty, we vary each parameter in the model [34] and study the change of the reduced 2 of the fit to the charged lepton data from which they were originally determined. We take the shift that corresponds to a one unit shift in fit 2 as the uncertainty for each parameter. The values and the associated uncertainties of A ht , B ht , C v1u , and C v2u are determined to be 0:538 AE 0:134, 0:305 AE 0:076, 0:291 AE 0:087, and 0:189 AE 0:076, respectively. The other parameters (C v1d , C v2d , C su , and C sd ) have a negligible effect on the analysis. The effects of these uncertainties on the flux measurement and the acceptance correction are propagated to an uncertainty on the extracted cross section. The contributions from each parameter shift are added linearly to form the total DIS model uncertainty which is 2% below 8 GeV for both neutrino and antineutrino cross sections, and is negligible above this energy. The contamination from wrong-sign events is significant only for the antineutrino sample. To evaluate the uncertainty from this source, we recompute the cross section assuming no wrong-sign contamination and 2 times as much wrong-sign contamination.

            "text": "V. RESULTS Figure 10 shows the extracted energy dependence of the total cross section divided by energy (=E) for N CC and for \" N CC interactions on an isoscalar target. The cross section values are assigned to the average energy in the bin. Both cross sections approach a linear energy dependence for energies above 20 GeV. For neutrinos =E drops with increasing energy in the lower energy region. At 3 GeV the quasielastic cross section is still expected to be appreciable ( % 15%). Its contribution to =E falls rapidly with increasing energy as inelastic processes (resonance production and DIS) turn on. For antineutrinos the measured =E rises gradually in the region 5-20 GeV to its asymptotic high-energy value. In this case the falling fractional contribution of the quasielastic cross section is offset by the more gradual turn-on of the DIS process, which is expected due to its strong dependence on the antiquark component which rises slowly with increasing Q 2 . Table III summarizes the neutrino and antineutrino cross section results. Figure 11 shows MINOS neutrino and antineutrino results compared to the results from other experiments. The MINOS neutrino cross section agrees with previous measurements from CRS [9], SKAT [14], IHEP-JINR [12], and GGM-PS [10], but these experiments have significantly larger uncertainties. Our neutrino cross section is in good agreement and has comparable precision with the recent NOMAD measurement [15]. Our result is systematics limited in the region below 15 GeV where the largest uncertainties come from knowledge of the absolute muon and hadronic energy scales, whereas in NOMAD the flux determination dominates the uncertainty. The MINOS antineutrino cross section result is in good agreement with the sparse data available at lower energies and has much smaller uncertainty in the 10-30 GeV region. Figure 12 and Table IV show the ratio of the \" N CC to N CC inclusive cross section as a function of energy. Because of the cancellation of many of the systematic uncertainties the MINOS result is statistics limited above 10 GeV. The cross section ratio appears to gradually approach its asymptotic scaling value of 0:504 AE 0:003, defined by the world average from 30-200 GeV calculated from previous experiments [4]. The MINOS average ratio measured from 30-50 GeV of 0:489 AE 0:012 is in good  [1][2][3]11,19] and the dashed black lines show this value extrapolated to lower energies. The neutrino cross section above 30 GeV is normalized using this world average value and the same normalization constant is then applied to the antineutrinos. The solid black line on the antineutrino cross section plot shows a world average antineutrino cross section value of 0:329 \u00c2 10 \u00c038 cm 2 =GeV from 30 to 50 GeV [2,3,11]. This value is shown for comparison and is not used for antineutrino sample normalization. agreement with the asymptotic value. At 10 GeV the measured ratio is 14% below the asymptotic value with 6:6 significance and at 24 GeV the measurement lies 7% below with 2:4 significance. Our precise data show a slower approach to scaling behavior than has been previously claimed by low-energy measurements, 2 which found their data to be consistent with scaling in the few GeV range [8,14,22]. Figure 12 also shows the cross section ratio compared with the few other existing measurements. The MINOS data uniquely span the 10-30 GeV region. It overlaps the precise high-energy measurements [17,21] as well as the Gargamelle low-energy measurement [22] which has precision of only about 20%.",

The quark parton model is used to estimate the fraction of the total quark momentum that is carried by antiquarks,  3 The NEUGEN3 model, as described earlier, uses a value of M QE A \u00bc 0:99. We provide the raw measured r so that one can use other models to compute the inelastic fraction. This will be especially useful as knowledge of M QE A improves. For reference, increasing M QE A by 0.15 decreases the inelastic fraction by less than 1% at 5.9 GeV, which is small compared with the experimental uncertainty. section from 5-30 GeV with a precision in the range 3%-9%. The flux was determined by using a subsample of lowhadronic-energy events to measure the flux shape and the world average cross section above 30 GeV for normalization. This method was previously used at higher energies [17,21] and here we have extended it down to 3 GeV. While the measurements are systematics dominated, the overall systematic uncertainty benefits from partial cancellation in detector related systematic uncertainties that arise from measuring the flux and the CC event rate in the same detector. Both measurements impact the precision of total cross section measurements in the less than 30 GeV range.",

Here we provide the raw data cross section to flux sample ratio R \u00f0 \" \u00de corrected only for detector effects and backgrounds. This will allow the reader to use an alternative cross section model and our data to compute neutrino and antineutrino cross sections. Table V gives the values of R (R \" for antineutrinos) where both numerator and denominator have been corrected for detector effects and backgrounds using our GEANT3-based detector simulation. The ratio has not been corrected for the effect of the kinematic E > 1:5 GeV cut, which affects only the numerator. The unnormalized neutrino cross section unnorm \u00f0E\u00de can be computed from R \u00f0E\u00de by applying two corrections, unnorm \u00f0E\u00de \u00bc K \u00f0E\u00de \u00c2 S \u00f0 0 ; E\u00de \u00c2 R \u00f0E\u00de;",
