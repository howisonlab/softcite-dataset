            "text": "The CDF experiment first reported evidence for a new state called Y (4140) in the decay B + \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8K + [1]. In a subsequent analysis, CDF claimed the observation of the Y (4140) with a statistical significance greater than 5\u03c3 with a mass of [4143.4 +2.9 \u22123.0 (stat) \u00b1 0.6(syst)] MeV/c 2 and a width of [15.3 +10.4 \u22120.1 (stat)\u00b12.5(syst)] MeV [2]. However, the existence of the Y (4140) was not confirmed by the Belle [3] or LHCb [4] collaborations in the same process, nor by the Belle collaboration in two-photon production [3]. Recently, the CMS [5] and D0 [6] collaborations reported on analyses of B + \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8K + , where an accumulation of events is observed in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 invariant mass distribution, with resonance parameters consistent with those of the CDF measurement. The BABAR collaboration also investigated the same decay mode, and found no evidence for the Y (4140) [7].",

            "text": "Being well above the open charm threshold, the narrow structure Y (4140) is difficult to be interpreted as a conventional charmonium state [8], while it is a good candidate for a molecular [9][10][11][12][13][14], ccss tetraquark [15], or charmonium hybrid state [10]. A detailed review on the Y (4140) is given in Ref. [16]. The Y (4140) is the first charmoniumlike state decaying into two vector mesons consisting of cc and ss pairs. Since both the \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 have J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system has positive C-parity, and can be searched for through radiative transitions of Y (4260) or other 1 \u2212\u2212 charmonium or charmoniumlike states. The author of Ref. [10] found that the partial width of the radiative transition Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3Y (4140) may be up to several tens of keV if both the Y (4260) and Y (4140) are hybrid charmonium states. The data samples collected at center-of-mass (CM) energies near the Y (4260) at the BESIII experiment can be used to search for such transitions.",

Since leptons from the J/\u03c8 decays are kinematically well separated from other charged tracks, tracks with momenta larger than 1.0 GeV/c in the laboratory frame are assumed to be leptons. We use the energy deposited in the EMC to separate electrons from muons. For muon candidates, the deposited energy is less than 0.4 GeV, while for electrons it is larger than 1.0 GeV. EMC showers identified as photon candidates must satisfy the following requirements. The minimum required energy deposited in the EMC is 25 MeV for the barrel (| cos \u03b8| < 0.8) and 50 MeV for the endcaps (0.86 < | cos \u03b8| < 0.92). To eliminate showers associated with charged particles, e.g. from bremsstrahlung, a photon must be separated by at least 20 degrees from any charged track. The timing information from the EMC is also required to be in 0-700 ns to suppress electronic noise and energy deposits unrelated to signal events.",

In order to increase the efficiency, only one kaon is required to be found and to pass through the PID selection using both dE/dx and TOF information. To improve the mass resolution and suppress backgrounds, a one-constraint (1C) kinematic fit is performed with the \u03b3K + K \u2212 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 (\u2113 = e or \u00b5) hypothesis, constraining the missing mass to the Kaon mass, and the \u03c7 2 is required to be less than 25.

A rough estimation for B(X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) is 5% [39]. Combining these numbers, we estimate the ratio \u03c3[e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3Y (4140)]/\u03c3[e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872)] is at the order of 0.1 or even smaller at \u221a s = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV.",
