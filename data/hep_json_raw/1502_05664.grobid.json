Events with an oppositely-charged pair of muons or electrons together with an isolated photon are selected. The differential cross section as a function of the photon transverse momentum is measured inclusively and exclusively, where the exclusive selection applies a veto on central jets. The observed cross sections are compatible with the expectations of next-to-next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamics. Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings of ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 are set that improve on previous experimental results obtained with the charged lepton decay modes of the Z boson.",

            "text": "The study of Z\u03b3 production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at TeV energies represents an important test of the standard model (SM), which prohibits direct coupling between the Z boson and the photon. Within the SM Z\u03b3 production is primarily due to radiation of photons from initial-state quarks (ISR) or final-state leptons (FSR). However, new physics phenomena at higher energies may be manifested as an effective self-coupling among neutral gauge bosons, resulting in a deviation from their predicted zero values in the SM. Models of anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC) have been introduced and discussed in refs. [1][2][3].",

For this analysis the decays of the Z boson into a pair of muons (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) or electrons (e + e \u2212 ) are considered. The processes of ISR and FSR contribute to + \u2212 \u03b3 ( = \u00b5, e) production in the SM at leading order (LO), and these are exemplified by the first two Feynman diagrams in figure 1. Photons can also be produced by jet fragmentation, but these photons are not considered as signal in the present analysis and are strongly suppressed by requiring that the photon is isolated. The production of Z\u03b3 through triple gauge couplings is represented by the third diagram in figure 1. Figure 1. Leading-order Feynman diagrams for Z\u03b3 production in pp collisions.

The larger 2012 data sample and the increased cross section at 8 TeV allow for the first measurement of the inclusive differential cross section for Z\u03b3 production as a function of the photon transverse momentum p \u03b3 T . Results on the differential Z\u03b3 cross section for events with no accompanying central jets, referred to as exclusive cross sections, are also presented, providing some insight into the effect of additional jets on the distribution of p \u03b3 T . The cross sections are measured for photons with p \u03b3 T > 15 GeV and restricted to a phase space defined by kinematic requirements on the final-state particles that are motivated by the experimental acceptance. In addition, the photon is required to be separated from the leptons by \u2206R( , \u03b3) > 0.7 where \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 , \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle and \u03b7 the pseudorapidity. Furthermore, the dilepton invariant mass is required to be above 50 GeV. With this selection the fraction of FSR photons is reduced and photons originating from ISR or aTGCs are dominant.",

Additionally, we have to consider the small fraction of irreducible background events from tt, ZZ, ZW, and WW production. These background yields are estimated from the SM simulation and subtracted from the p \u03b3 T distribution of signal candidates. At low p \u03b3 T this contribution is negligible compared to the background from nonprompt or misidentified photons. At higher p \u03b3 T the fraction of irreducible background events is less than 4%, which is small compared to the overall uncertainty of the measurement. Since these backgrounds are very small their uncertainties have a negligible effect on the measurement.",

This phase space is defined by several kinematic requirements on the final-state particles: the leptons from the Z boson decay need to satisfy p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and the dilepton mass has to be greater than 50 GeV. The photon is required to have |\u03b7| < 2.5 and needs to be separated from both leptons by \u2206R( , \u03b3) > 0.7. Finally, a requirement is put on the photon isolation at the generator level I gen < 5 GeV to exclude photons from jet fragmentation. The isolation variable uses a cone size of \u2206R < 0.3 and sums the transverse momentum of partons in the case of mcfm and of final-state particles in the case of sherpa. It has been verified with sherpa that photons that do not pass the I gen selection also fail to pass the photon selection at the detector level.

            "text": "The procedure for extracting the differential cross section from the number of observed signal events involves two steps. First, we extract the number of events produced in each p \u03b3 T bin within a phase space defined by the requirements in table 1 and the additional experimental requirements on \u03b7 and \u03b7 SC as described in section 4. The number of observed signal events needs to be corrected for detector effects. These include efficiencies as well as bin migrations due to resolution and energy calibration. Both effects are treated using unfolding techniques. For the unfolding the method of D'Agostini [32], as implemented in the RooUnfold [33] software package, is used. The response matrices are obtained from the signal simulation. A different response matrix is required for the two template methods because of the different photon selections. After the unfolding, compatible signal yields are obtained with the two template methods. Bias and variance of the unfolding procedure are estimated using pseudoexperiments. The uncertainties in the unfolding are 1% at low p \u03b3 T increasing up to 6% for the high-p \u03b3 T bins. To estimate the effect of the uncertainties in the photon energy scale and resolution, the unfolding of the data is repeated varying the photon energy scale and resolution in the response matrix within one standard deviation. The observed effect on the unfolded event yield is about 2.4% and is almost independent of p \u03b3 T . The second step is to extrapolate the unfolded event yield in each p \u03b3 T bin to the desired phase space taking into account the detector acceptance, which is calculated using mcfm (NLO) and verified with sherpa. About 92% of the muon channel events and 87% of the electron channel events are within the detector acceptance. These values are only slightly p \u03b3 T dependent.",

Events with ISR photons appear in the large tail above the Z boson mass where a large fraction of background is expected.
