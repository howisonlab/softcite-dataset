The A 0 is a hypothetical CP-odd light Higgs boson predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model including two spin-0 doublets plus an extra singlet. We find no evidence for A 0 production and set 90% confidence-level upper limits on the product branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3A 0 )\u00d7B(A 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) in the range of (2.8 \u2212 495.3) \u00d7 10 \u22128 for 0.212 \u2264 m A 0 \u2264 3.0 GeV/c 2 . The new limits are 5 times below our previous results, and the nature of the A 0 is constrained to be mostly singlet. The radiative decays of the J/\u03c8 have long been identified as a way to search for new particles such as a light scalar, a pseudo-scalar Higgs boson [1], or a light spin-1 gauge boson [2]. In particular a light CP-odd pseudoscalar may be present in various models of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [3]. The NMSSM appends an additional singlet chiral superfield to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [4], in order to solve or alleviate the so-called \"little hierarchy problem\" [5]. It has a rich Higgs sector containing three CP-even, two CP-odd and two charged Higgs bosons. The mass of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson, A 0 , may be less than twice the mass of the charmed quark.",

The correction of first order in the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ) is as large as 30% [7] but comparable to the theoretical uncertainties [9]. In the NMSSM, g c = cos \u03b8 A / tan \u03b2 for the c-quark and g b = cos \u03b8 A tan \u03b2 for the b-quark, where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the expectation values of the up and down types of the Higgs doublets and cos \u03b8 A the fraction of the non-singlet component in the A 0 [10,11]; cos \u03b8 A takes into account the doublet-singlet mixing and would be small for a mostly-singlet pseudoscalar [2]. The branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3A 0 could be in the range of 10 \u22129 -10 \u22127 [12], making it accessible at high intensity e + e \u2212 collider experiments. The BABAR [13][14][15][16], CLEO [17], and CMS [18] experiments have performed searches for A 0 in various decay processes and placed very strong exclusion limits on g b [10,15,16,18]. The BES III experiment, on the other hand, is sensitive to g c . Existing constraints on [11]. The search for the A 0 in J/\u03c8 experiments is particularly important at lower values of tan \u03b2, typically for tan \u03b2 < \u223c 2 .",

A helium based (40% He, 60% C 3 H 8 ) 43 layer main drift chamber (MDC), operating in a 1.0 T solenoidal magnetic field, is used to measure the momentum of charged particles. Charged particle identification (PID) is based on the time-of-flight (TOF) measured by a scintillation based TOF system, which has one barrel portion and two end-caps, and the energy loss (dE/dx) in the tracking system. Photon and electron energies are measured in a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), while muons are identified using a muon counter (MUC) system containing nine (eight) layers of resistive plate chamber counters interleaved with steel in the barrel (end-cap) region.",

The two muon candidates are required to meet at a common vertex to form the Higgs candidate. To improve the mass resolution of the A 0 candidates, a four-constraint (4C) kinematic fit is performed with two charged tracks and each of the photons. If there is more than one \u03b3\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidate, the one with the minimum 4C \u03c7 2 is selected, and the \u03c7 2 is required to be less than 40 to suppress background contributions from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 .

This result, a factor of 5 times improvement over the previous BESIII measurement [19], is in agreement with the theoretical expectation < \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cot 4 \u03b2 from [11], but better than the BABAR measurement [16] in the lowmass region for the tan \u03b2 \u2264 0.6. The combined limits on cos \u03b8 A \u00d7 B(A 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) for the BABAR [16] and BESIII measurements reveal that the A 0 is constrained to be mostly singlet. We compute gc tan 2 \u03b2 \u00d7 B(A 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) for different values of tan \u03b2 to compare our results with the BABAR measurement [16].",
