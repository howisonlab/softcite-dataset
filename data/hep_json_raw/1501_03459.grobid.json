For the new run the KLOE has been upgraded by adding new tagger systems for the \u03b3\u03b3 physics, the inner tracking chamber and two calorimeters in the final focusing region. We are also improving on kaon identification techniques, in particular algorithms for the K S meson tagging. In this article we discuss the impact of the improved tagging procedure on studies of the K S decays.",

Since e + e \u2212 beams collide in the horizontal plane at small angle, K S and K L are produced almost back-to-back, with total momentum, P T \u223c 15 MeV/c. Therefore, observation of a K L (K S ) meson ensures (tags) the presence of the K S (K L ) flying in the opposite direction and the kinematical closure can be used to determine the momentum of tagged kaons. Thus, at DA\u03a6NE we obtain pure K S and K L beams with precisely known momenta and flux, which can be used to measure absolute branching fractions [2]. The tagging is performed mainly by the reconstruction of the K L interaction in the calorimeter (\"K L crash\"), which provides a very clean identification of the \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L events. The other method is based on reconstruction of the K L decay inside the drift chamber which may significantly increase the tagging efficiency.",

Adding the information about the position of the energy release (K L cluster), the direction of the K L flight path can be determined with a good precision. In Fig. 1 we present distribution of cos\u03b8 rel , i.e., cosine of an angle between reconstructed and true K L direction for a sample of simulated \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L events.

It is used to select clusters corresponding to K L with \u03b2 cl \u223c 0.22 (see Fig. 2). To reject delayed clusters due to charged pions for which the track-to-cluster association procedure failed, we require an energy deposition of at least 100 MeV. Kaons from the \u03c6 decay are mostly emitted at a large polar angle so that the background can be additionally suppressed selecting only \"K L crash\" clusters in the barrel calorimeter [4]. The small remaining background contamination originates from \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays and cosmic muons entering KLOE through the intersection between the barrel and endcap calorimeters. As one can see in Fig. 2 this contamination is characterized by a flat \u03b2 cl distribution. The efficiency of this tagging procedure depends on the requirements on K L velocity and cluster energy, and is in the range of 23-34% [5,6,7,8,9,10]. It is worth mentioning that, according to the KLOE Monte Carlo simulations, about 30% of K L interactions reconstructed in the calorimeter fulfill the KLOE trigger conditions allowing for a search of the K S \u2192 invisible decays which, if observed, would be an unambiguous signal of physics beyond the Standard Model [11].",

Efficiency of this tagging procedure was studied with Monte Carlo simulations for the main K S decay channels.

In particular, the evaluation of the impact of tagging with K L charged decay reconstruction on rare K S decays measurements, such as the K S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays is a first objective of these studies. Improved kaon identification techniques are also important in view of data which have been collected with the KLOE-2 apparatus equipped with the inner tracker [13], new scintillation calorimeters [14,15] and tagging detectors for \u03b3\u03b3 physics [16,17].
