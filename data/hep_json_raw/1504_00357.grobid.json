The angular distributions are studied in events with at least two jets; the highest dijet mass observed is 5.5 TeV. All angular distributions are consistent with the predictions of the standard model. In a benchmark model of quark contact interactions, a compositeness scale below 8.1 TeV in a destructive interference scenario and 12.0 TeV in a constructive interference scenario is excluded at 95% C.L.; median expected limits are 8.9 TeV for the destructive interference scenario and 14.1 TeV for the constructive interference scenario.",

Events generated by PYTHIA8 are reweighted using a correction factor calculated based on the ratio of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross-section calculation from NLOJET++ [31][32][33]  The K factors decrease with \u03c7 and thus modify the shape of the angular distributions; the impact ranges from a few percent at low m jj to approximately 15% for the highest m jj region. Additional processes accounting for electroweak (EW) effects not included in PYTHIA8 (virtual weak boson exchange and Sudakov-type logarithms) are included as EW corrections [34]. The effect is most pronounced at high m jj and low \u03c7, and the correction factors range from unity at low m jj to 0.98-1.12 in the highest m jj region. The EW corrections and the NLO K factors are applied as a function of \u03c7 and m jj to the PYTHIA8 prediction. Figure 1 shows the distributions of the data as a function of \u03c7. The distribution in each m jj region is normalized to unity, as the sensitivity to new phenomena is due to the angular distribution rather than normalization. The predicted SM distributions are also shown in Fig. 1 and describe the data well. The EW corrections substantially improve the agreement of the SM prediction with data at high m jj , as can be appreciated from the comparison of the  FIG. 1 (color online).

Theoretical uncertainties in the SM and signal predictions are due to the choice of PDF, renormalization and factorization scales, choice of event generator, as well as statistical uncertainties due to limited simulation sample sizes. The impact of the uncertainty in the PDF is estimated using NLOJET++ with three different PDFs: CT10, MSTW2008 [36], and NNPDF23 [37]. These uncertainties are negligible (< 1%), as the choice of PDF largely impacts the total cross section rather than the angular distributions. The uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales were estimated by varying those independently up and down by a factor two in NLOJET++. The resulting uncertainty varies with m jj and \u03c7, rising to 4% at the smallest \u03c7 values at high m jj . The uncertainty due to the choice of generator is estimated by comparing the predictions from the NLO generator POWHEG [38] v1.0 with those of PYTHIA8 with K factors applied. The largest uncertainty due to choice of generator is at the lowest m jj values, where it approaches 20%, while for the highest m jj values and smallest \u03c7, it ranges from 10% to 14%. The uncertainty due to the choice of the showering model is estimated through comparison of POWHEG samples showered and hadronized with PYTHIA8 v8.175 to HERWIG [39] v6.520.2 samples using JIMMY [40,41] v4.31. The largest value of this uncertainty is less than 1% at the highest m jj values and smallest values of \u03c7. Finally the statistical uncertainties on the K factors due to limited simulation sample size are small and set to 1%.",
