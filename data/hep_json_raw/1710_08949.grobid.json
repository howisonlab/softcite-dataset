The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 , was collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The B 0 lifetime is measured to be 453.0 \u00b1 1.6 (stat) \u00b1 1.8 (syst) \u00b5m in J/\u03c8 K * (892) 0 and 457.8 \u00b1 2.7 (stat) \u00b1 2.8 (syst) \u00b5m in J/\u03c8 K 0 S , which results in a combined measurement of c\u03c4 B 0 = 454.1 \u00b1 1.4 (stat) \u00b1 1.7 (syst) \u00b5m. The effective lifetime of the B 0 s meson is measured in two decay modes, with contributions from different amounts of the heavy and light eigenstates. This results in two different measured lifetimes: c\u03c4 B 0 s \u2192J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 = 502.7 \u00b1 10.2 (stat) \u00b1 3.4 (syst) \u00b5m and c\u03c4 B 0 s \u2192J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) = 443.9 \u00b1 2.0 (stat) \u00b1 1.5 (syst) \u00b5m. The 0 b lifetime is found to be 442.9 \u00b1 8.2 (stat) \u00b1 2.8 (syst) \u00b5m. The precision from each of these channels is as good as or better than previous measurements. The B + c lifetime, measured with respect to the B + to reduce the systematic uncertainty, is 162.3 \u00b1 7.8 (stat) \u00b1 4.2 (syst) \u00b1 0.1 (\u03c4 B + ) \u00b5m.

The standard CMS muon reconstruction procedure [25] is used to identify the muons, which requires multiple hits in the pixel, strip, and muon detectors with a consistent trajectory throughout. The offline selection requirements on the dimuon system replicate the trigger selection. From the sample of collected J/\u03c8 events, candidate b hadrons are reconstructed by combining a J/\u03c8 candidate with track(s) or reconstructed neutral particles, depending on the decay mode. Only tracks that pass the standard CMS high-purity requirements [17] are used. The b hadron candidate is fitted to a common vertex with the appropriate masses assigned to the charged tracks and the dimuon invariant mass constrained to the worldaverage J/\u03c8 mass [2]. In fits that include a K 0 S or 0 hadron, the world-average mass is used for those particles. Primary vertices (PV) are fitted from the reconstructed tracks using an estimate of the proton-proton interaction region (beamspot) as a constraint. The PV having the smallest pointing angle, defined as the angle between the reconstructed b hadron momentum and the vector joining the PV with the decay vertex, is used. As the proper decay times are measured in the transverse plane, where the PV position is dominated by the beamspot, the choice of PV has little effect on the analysis and is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty.

In the theoretical model, the values of the physics parameters are set to those used in the simulated sample. Figure 1 shows the efficiency as a function of ct for the various decay modes, with an arbitrary normalization since only the relative efficiency is relevant. The efficiencies display a sharp rise as ct increases from 0 to 0.01 cm, followed by a slow decrease as ct increases further. The ct efficiency is modelled with an inverse power function.",

For the B 0 , B 0 s , and 0 b lifetime measurements, the background model is changed to a higher-degree polynomial, a Chebyshev polynomial, or an exponential function, and the signal model is changed from two Gaussian functions to a single Gaussian function or a sum of three Gaussian functions. Differences in the measured lifetime between the results of the nominal and alternative models are used to estimate the systematic uncertainty, with the variations due to the modelling of signal and background components evaluated separately and added in quadrature. For the B + c lifetime measurement, the signal peak is alternatively modelled with a Crystal Ball distribution [28]. The alternative description for the background is a first-order Chebyshev distribution. The removal of the Cabibbosuppressed B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + contribution is also considered. The maximum deviation of the signal yield in each ct bin from the nominal value is propagated to the statistical uncertainty in the per-bin yield. The fit to R(ct) is performed and the difference in quadrature between the uncertainty from this fit and the nominal measurement is taken as the systematic uncertainty. 7.2 Channel-specific systematic uncertainties 1. Modelling of the background ct shape in the B 0 s , B 0 , and \u039b 0 b channels To estimate a systematic uncertainty due to the ct background model, we add an additional background contribution modelled with its own lifetime, and compare the result to that obtained with the nominal fit model. The difference between the results of the nominal and alternative fit models is used as the systematic uncertainty from the ct shape modelling. 2. The B + contamination in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample In the nominal fit, the yield and lifetime of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + contamination are determined from the fit with the mass shape obtained from simulation. An alternative estimate of the J/\u03c8 K + contamination is obtained from data by taking the leading pion of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay to be the kaon. The lifetime and yield of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays contaminating the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample are determined from a fit of the B + signal candidates in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample, with the mass shape also obtained from the data. The difference between the B 0 s lifetime found with this model and the nominal model is considered as the systematic uncertainty due to B + contamination. 3. Invariant mass window of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel Although the events selected by the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass window are dominated by the f 0 (980), its width is not well known and possible backgrounds under the f 0 (980) peak could be increased or decreased, depending on the mass window. The effect on the lifetime is studied by using mass windows of \u00b130 and \u00b180 MeV around the signal peak, compared to the nominal fit result with a \u00b150 MeV window. The maximum variation of the lifetime is taken as the systematic uncertainty. 4. The K + \u03c0 \u2212 mass assignments for K * (892) 0 candidates in the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * (892) 0 channel The K * (892) 0 candidates are constructed from a pair of tracks with kaon and pion mass assignments. The combination with invariant mass closest to the world-average K * (892) 0 mass is chosen to reconstruct the B 0 candidate. To estimate the effect on the lifetime due to a possible misassignment of kaon and pion, both combinations are discarded if both are within the natural width of the K * (892) 0 mass, and the difference between the lifetime obtained with this sample and the nominal sample is taken as the systematic uncertainty. 5. The ct range in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) channel Since the ct > 0.02 cm requirement distorts the fractions of heavy and light mass eigenstates, the measured B 0 s effective lifetime must be corrected.

The S-wave contamination in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) channel The B 0 s candidates reconstructed in the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) final state contain a small fraction of nonresonant and CP-odd B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decays, where the invariant mass of the two kaons happens to be near the \u03c6 meson mass. The fraction of B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decays among the selected events is measured in the weak mixing phase analysis [9] to be f S = (1.2 +0.9 \u22120.7 )%. Because of the different trigger and signal selection criteria of the present analysis, the S-wave fraction is corrected according to the simulation to be (1.5 +1.1 \u22120.9 )%. The bias caused by the contamination of nonresonant B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decays is estimated by generating two sets of pseudo-experiments, one with just B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) events and one with a fraction of Swave events based on the measured S-wave fraction and its uncertainty. The difference in the average of the measured lifetimes of these two samples is 0.74 \u00b5m, which is used to correct the measured lifetime. The systematic uncertainty associated with this correction is obtained by taking the difference in quadrature between the standard deviation of the distribution of lifetime results from the pseudo-experiments with and without the S-wave contribution. 7. PV selection in the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + channel From the multiple reconstructed PVs in an event, one is selected to compute the ct value of the candidate. Two alternative methods to select the PV position are studied: using the centre of the beamspot and selecting the PV with the largest sum of track p T . While all three methods are found to be effective and unbiased, there were small differences, and the maximum deviation with respect to the nominal choice is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The B + and B + c primary vertex choices were changed coherently. 8. Detector alignment in the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + channel Possible effects on the lifetime due to uncertainties in the detector alignment [29] are investigated for each decay topology using 20 different simulated samples with distorted geometries. These distortions include expansions in the radial and longitudinal dimensions, rotations, twists, offsets, etc. The amount of misalignment is chosen such that it is large enough to be detected and corrected by the alignment procedure. The standard deviation of the lifetimes for the tested scenarios is taken as the sys-tematic uncertainty from this source. The B + and B + c geometries were changed coherently. 9. Absolute ct accuracy in the B 0 s , B 0 , and \u039b 0 b lifetime measurements The lifetime of the most statistically precise mode (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + ) is used to validate the accuracy of the simulation and various detector calibrations. The difference between our measurement of 490.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5m (statistical uncertainty only) and the world-average value of 491.1\u00b1 1.2 \u00b5m [5] is 0.2 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5m. This implies a limit to the validation of 1.4/491 = 0.3%. Four systematic effects that we expect to be included were checked independently. The systematic uncertainties from PV selection and detector alignment were found to be 0.7 \u00b5m and 0.3-0.7 \u00b5m, respectively. Varying the efficiency functional form changed the lifetimes by 0.3-0.6 \u00b5m, while varying \u03c3 ct by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 resulted in lifetime differences of no more than 0.2 \u00b5m. As the sum in quadrature of these uncertainties is less than that obtained from the B + lifetime comparison, we assign a value of 0.3% as the systematic uncertainty for the absolute ct accuracy.",

The data were collected by the CMS detector in protonproton collision events at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The B 0 and B 0 s meson lifetimes have each been measured in two channels: J/\u03c8 K * (892) 0 , J/\u03c8 K 0 S for B 0 andJ/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , J/\u03c8 \u03c6 (1020) for B 0 s . The precision from each channel is as good as or better than previous measurements in the respective channel. The B 0 lifetime results are used to obtain an average lifetime and to measure the decay width difference between the two mass eigenstates. The B 0 s lifetime results are used to obtain the lifetimes of the heavy and light B 0 s mass eigenstates. The precision of the \u039b 0 b lifetime measurement is also as good as any previous measurement in the J/\u03c8 0 channel. The measured B + c meson lifetime is in agreement with the results from LHCb and significantly more precise than the CDF and D0 measurements. All measured lifetimes are compatible with the current world-average values. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
