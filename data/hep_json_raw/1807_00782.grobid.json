The analysis uses data collected by the CMS experiment in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.26 fb \u22121 . The cross section for inclusive isolated photon production is measured as a function of the photon transverse energy in a fiducial region. The cross section for photon+jet production is measured as a function of the photon transverse energy in the same fiducial region with identical photon requirements and with the highest transverse momentum jet. All measurements are in agreement with predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD.",

The clustering algorithm results in an almost complete collection of the energy of the photons, unconverted ones and those converting in the material upstream of the calorimeter. First, cluster \"seeds\" are identified as local energy maxima above a given threshold. Second, clusters are grown from the seeds by aggregating crystals with at least one side in common with a clustered crystal and with an energy in excess of a given threshold. This threshold represents about two standard deviations of the electronic noise, which depends on |\u03b7|. The energy in an individual crystal can be shared between clusters under the assumption that each seed corresponds to a single EM particle. Finally, clusters are merged into \"superclusters\", to allow good energy containment, accounting for geometrical variations of the detector along \u03b7, and increasing robustness against additional pp collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup). The clustering excludes 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.56, which corresponds to the transition region between the EB and EE. The fiducial region terminates at |\u03b7| = 2.5 where the tracker coverage ends.",

The preshower energy is added to that of the superclusters in the region covered by this detector. To optimize the resolution, the photon energy is corrected using a multivariate regression technique that estimates the containment of the electromagnetic shower in the superclusters, the shower losses for photons that convert in the material upstream of the calorimeter, and the effects of pileup [28]. The regression training is performed on simulated events using shower shape and position variables of the photon as inputs. The regression provides a per-photon estimate of the function parameters that quantify the containment, the shower losses, and pileup and therefore a prediction of the distribution of the ratio of true energy to the uncorrected supercluster energy. The most probable value of this distribution is taken as the photon energy correction. The regression output is used to correct the reconstucted photon energy in data to agree with simulated events. An additional smearing is applied to the photon energy in simulation to reproduce the resolution observed in data. The scale correction and smearing procedure uses a multistep procedure exploiting electrons from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays. In the EB, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining EB photons have a resolution of about 1.3% up to |\u03b7| = 1.0, rising to about 2.5% at |\u03b7| = 1.4.

The renormalization, factorization, and fragmentation scales are all set to be equal to the photon E T . To estimate the effect of the choice of theoretical scales on the predictions, the three scales are varied independently from E T /2 to 2E T , while keeping their ratio between onehalf and two. The impact of jetphox cross section predictions due to the uncertainties in the PDF and in the strong coupling \u03b1 S = 0.118 at the mass of Z boson is calculated using the 68% confidence level NNPDF3.0 NLO replica. The uncertainty of parton-to-particle level transformation of the NLO pQCD prediction due to the underlying event and parton shower is studied by comparing with dedicated pythia samples where the choice and tuning of the generator has been modified. The differences between the dedicated pythia and the nominal sample are between 0.5 and 2.0%, depending on the photon E T and y, and they are assigned as the systematic uncertainty. The total theoretical uncertainties of the cross section predictions are evaluated as the quadratic sum of the scale, PDF,\u03b1 S , and underlying event and parton shower uncertainties.",
