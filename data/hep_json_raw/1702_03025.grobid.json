            "text": "With the discovery of the Higgs boson at the CERN LHC [1,2], the standard model (SM) became a great success. The high energy and luminosity of the LHC provides the opportunity to observe many processes that are predicted by the SM, including electroweak production of multiple gauge bosons (WV\u03b3 [3], V\u03b3 \u03b3 [4-6]), vector boson scattering (VBS) (same charge W \u00b1 W \u00b1 scattering [7][8][9], \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 [10], EW W\u03b3 jj [11], W \u00b1 Z [12]), and vector boson fusion (VBF) (EW W(Z)jj [13][14][15][16]). Same charge W \u00b1 W \u00b1 scattering has been observed by ATLAS, and the exclusive \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 process by CMS, both with significances larger than 3 standard deviations. The triboson final state Z\u03b3 \u03b3 has been observed by ATLAS and CMS with a significance larger than 5 standard deviations. The EW production of a Z boson (decaying into two oppositely-charged leptons), a photon, and two jets (henceforth denoted Z\u03b3 jj) has never been studied before, and is the subject of this paper. While the cross section for quantum chromodynamic (QCD) induced Z\u03b3 jj production is orders of magnitude larger than the one for EW production, the latter can be used to perform important tests of the SM, and to search for contribu-E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. tions from physics beyond the SM that could manifest themselves as anomalous trilinear or quartic gauge boson couplings (aTGC or aQGC [3][4][5][6][7][9][10][11][12]).",

            "text": "This letter presents a measurement of the associated EW production of Z\u03b3 jj, using the 8 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector. The major processes contributing to EW Z\u03b3 jj production are represented by the Feynman diagrams in Fig. 1. They are (a) bremsstrahlung, (b) multiperipheral (or nonresonant) production, (c, d) VBF with either two trilinear gauge boson couplings (TGC), or (e) VBS with quartic gauge boson couplings (QGC). The VBS processes are particularly interesting because they involve QGCs (e.g. WWZ\u03b3 ). It is not possible, however, to isolate the QGC processes from the other contributions, such as the double TGC processes that are topologically similar. The interference of the VBS diagrams ensures unitarity of the VBS cross section in the SM at high energy. We present measurements of the combined cross sections for all EW processes that result in the Z\u03b3 jj final state. The main background source is Z\u03b3 jj production where the associated jets are produced through QCD-induced processes (such as the Feynman diagram given in Fig. 1(f)). Other backgrounds include jets or leptons misidentified as photons, diboson processes in which a W or Z boson decays into two jets and the photon originates from initial or final-state radiation, and contributions from top quark pairs and single top quark production.",

To reduce the contamination from pileup, charged PF candidates in the tracker acceptance region |\u03b7| < 2.4, are excluded from the jet clustering procedure if associated with pileup vertices. The contribution of neutral particles from pileup events to the jet energy is taken into account by means of a correction based on the projected area of the jet on the front face of the calorimeter. Jet energy corrections are derived from a measurement of the p T balance in dijet and photon + jet events in data [28]. Further residual corrections as functions of p T and \u03b7 are applied to the data to correct for the small differences between data and simulation. Additional quality criteria are applied to the jets in order to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in the calorimeters or in the tracker [29]. The two jets with the highest p T are tagged as the signal jets and are required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.7. Since we are primarily interested in the VBS topologies, we require that the invariant mass of the two jets, M jj > 150 GeV. Table 1 presents a summary of the three different section criteria that are used for (1) the SM EW signal search, (2) the SM fiducial cross section measurement, and (3) the aQGC searches. The criteria isolate events consistent with the VBS topology of two high-energy scattered jets separated by a large rapidity gap. The cross section measurement adds two variables sensitive to the VBS process: |y Z\u03b3 \u2212 (y j1 + y j2 )/2|, which ensures the Z\u03b3 systems is located between the scattered jets in eta; and \u03c6 Z\u03b3 ,jj , which requires the Z\u03b3 system transverse momentum is consistent with recoiling against the transverse momentum of the two combined jets. The fiducial cross section criteria constrain the VBS topology with only basic kinematic cuts that define the acceptance of the CMS detector and a simple two dimensional requirement on the rapidity separation and invariant mass of the jets. A tight p \u03b3 T selection is applied to reach a higher expected significance in a search for a possible aQGC signal in the EW Z\u03b3 jj process.",

The shape of this background is taken from MC simulation and the normalization is evaluated from data in a control region, defined as 150 < M jj < 400 GeV, where the signal contribution is below 1%.

The value is comparable with the NLO QCD K factor from Ref. [30], which is around 1.1 for M jj < 400 GeV. The background from fake photons arises mainly from Z+jets events where one jet satisfies the photon ID criteria. The estimation is based on events similar to the ones selected with the baseline selection described in Table 1, except that the photon must fail the tight photon ID and satisfy a looser ID requirement based on the charged isolation variable. This selection ensures that the photon arises from a jet, but still has kinematic properties similar to a genuine photon satisfying the tight photon ID.

Finally, we combine both the normalization factor uncertainty and the shape uncertainty to obtain the total uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty in the background estimation from fake photons arises from the variation in the choice of the charged isolation sideband and the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 distribution used for estimating the fake photon probability.

The measurement is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . We find evidence for EW Z\u03b3 jj production with an ob-served (expected) significance of 3.0 (2.1) standard deviations. The fiducial cross section for EW Z\u03b3 jj production is measured to be 1.86 +0.90 \u22120.75 (stat) +0.34 \u22120.26 (syst) \u00b1 0.05 (lumi) fb, consistent with the theoretical prediction. The fiducial cross section for combined EW and QCD Z\u03b3 jj production is 5.94 +1.53 \u22121.35 (stat) +0.43 \u22120.37 (syst) \u00b1 0.13 (lumi) fb, which is also consistent with the leading-order theoretical prediction.",

In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the computing centers and personnel of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid for delivering so effectively the computing infrastructure essential to our analyses. Finally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: BMWFW and FWF (Austria);   ",
