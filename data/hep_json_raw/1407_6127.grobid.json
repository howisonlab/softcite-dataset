Using these observables together with a recent measurement of the B 0 s mixing phase \u22122\u03b2 s leads to the first extraction of the CKM angle \u03b3 from B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 decays, finding \u03b3 = (115 +28 \u221243 ) \u2022 modulo 180 \u2022 at 68% CL, where the error contains both statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

No systematic uncertainty is attributed to the imperfect knowledge of the momentum and longitudinal scale of the detector since both effects are taken into account by the systematic uncertainty in \u2206m s . Both the cFit and sFit are found to be unbiased through studies of large ensembles of pseudoexperiments generated at the best-fit point in data. In addition, differences between the cFit and sFit are evaluated from the distributions of the per-pseudoexperiment differences of the fitted values. Both fitters return compatible results. Indeed, an important result of this analysis is that the sFit technique has been successfully used in an environment with such a large number of variables, parameters and categories. The sFit technique was able to perform an accurate subtraction of a variety of time-dependent backgrounds in a multidimensional fit, including different oscillation frequencies, different tagging behaviours, and backgrounds with modified decay-time distributions due to misreconstructed particles.",
