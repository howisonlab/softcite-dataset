This paper presents jet charge distributions in \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. These data correspond to integrated luminosities of 404 \u00b5b \u22121 and 27.4 pb \u22121 for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively. Leveraging the sensitivity of the jet charge to fundamental differences in the electric charges of quarks and gluons, the jet charge distributions from simulated events are used as templates to extract the quark-and gluon-like jet fractions from data. The modification of these jet fractions is examined by comparing pp and PbPb data as a function of the overlap of the colliding Pb nuclei (centrality). This measurement tests the color charge dependence of jet energy loss due to interactions with the quark-gluon plasma. No significant modification between different centrality classes and with respect to pp results is observed in the extracted quark-and gluon-like jet fractions.",

The mechanisms by which these partons lose energy to the medium, as well as their color dependence, are still not fully understood [2,3]. The particles resulting from the fragmentation and hadronization of these partons can be clustered into jets. Jets are used as parton proxies to examine the properties of the QGP. Parton energy loss manifests itself in various experimental observables including the suppression of high transverse momentum (p T ) hadrons and jets [4][5][6][7][8], as well as modifications of parton showers [9,10]. These phenomena are collectively referred to as jet quenching [1].",

            "text": "At leading order in quantum chromodynamics, the type of parton that initiates a jet can be distinguished. The resulting jet can therefore be labeled as a quark, antiquark, or gluon jet. Several recent measurements indicate that the fractions of quark and gluon jets in a sample may be modified as they are expected to suffer different energy loss in the QGP due to their different color charges [11,12]. This analysis explores the extraction of the fractions of quark and gluon jets from an inclusive jet sample in lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions. This is achieved with a template-fitting method using JHEP07(2020)115 the \"jet charge\" observable. Jet charge, defined as the momentum-weighted sum of the electric charges of particles inside a jet, is sensitive to the electric charge of the particle initiating a parton shower and can be used to discriminate between gluon-and quarkinitiated jets. This observable was initially suggested as a way of measuring the electric charge of a quark [13] and was first measured in deep inelastic scattering experiments at Fermilab [14,15], CERN [16][17][18][19], and Cornell University [20].",

At LHC energies, gluon contributions dominate jet production at lower transverse momenta, while the valence quark contributions overtake at higher jet p T [23]. According to predictions from the pythia event generator (version 6.424 [24], tune Z2 [25]) for pp collisions at 5.02 TeV, gluon jets are expected to constitute about 59% of a sample of jets with transverse momenta above 120 GeV. Similarly, up and down (anti)quark jets are predicted to make up about 32% of the sample with the other 9% arising from charm, strange and bottom (anti)quark jet contributions. A detailed investigation of jet charge and its applications in heavy ion collisions is motivated by extensive theoretical calculations [23,26,27]. The dependence of the mean and width (standard deviation) of the jet charge distribution on both jet energy and size, can be calculated independently of Monte Carlo (MC) fragmentation models despite the large experimental uncertainty in fragmentation functions [28]. This makes jet charge a suitable variable for the determination of quark and gluon jet fractions.",

The analysis uses PbPb and pp data at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, both collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 404 \u00b5b \u22121 (27.4 pb \u22121 ) for PbPb (pp) collisions [29]. In heavy ion collisions, the discrimination between jet and background constituents is not straightforward and often impossible on a per-particle basis. In this work, \"background\" is defined as uncorrelated and long-range correlated contributions [30], as measured at least 1.5 units of relative pseudorapidity (\u2206\u03b7) away from the jet axis [10,31,32], which do not arise from the jet-initiating parton shower. Any short-range modifications to either the medium or the jet structure are thus included in the jet \"signal\". The measurements are corrected for detector and background effects using an unfolding procedure, and are presented as a function of the overlap of the colliding Pb nuclei (centrality). The jet charge distributions of light (anti)quark and gluon jets from MC generators are used as templates to fit the inclusive jet charge distribution measured in data. The fractions of quark-and gluon-initiated jets are extracted from this fitting procedure and are referred to as quark-and gluon-like jet fractions. The results are presented as a function of the minimum p T threshold of the particles used in the jet charge measurement and also as a function of a p T weighting factor, \u03ba [26].",

Individually calibrated calorimeter towers are used as inputs to the algorithm. Only calorimeter information is used in the jet reconstruction to minimize the bias of the tracking efficiency on the reconstruction of jets. In PbPb collisions, the contributions of the underlying event are subtracted using a two-iteration variant of the \"noise/pedestal subtraction\" technique described in refs. [43,44]. In this method, only calorimeter towers outside of the jet area are used in the background estimation after identifying and excluding the jets in the first iteration. The underlying event and pile-up contribution is negligible in pp collisions and therefore do not require any subtraction. In both PbPb and pp events, jet energy is calibrated and the calorimeter response is verified as a function of jet p T and \u03b7. To account for the variation in detector response with the total number of jet constituents, additional corrections are applied in both collision systems based on the number of charged-particle tracks with p T > 2 GeV within the jet cone (relative angular distance from the jet axis \u2206r = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 < 0.4), the jet p T , and the collision centrality [10]. This corrects for a difference in the simulated calorimetric jet energy response between quark and gluon jets and reduces the difference in response between the two jet flavors from 10% to around 3%. After reconstruction and offline jet energy calibration, jets are required to have p T > 120 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.5. In this kinematic range, the jet trigger is observed to be fully efficient and the jet energy response and resolution is optimized.

For the PbPb data an alternative iterative reconstruction procedure is employed because of the large track JHEP07(2020)115 multiplicities [45,46]. It is capable of reconstructing tracks down to p T = 0.4 GeV. The charge of the particle is measured based on the direction of curvature of the reconstructed track. Tracks used in this measurement are required to have a relative p T uncertainty of less than 10% (30%) in PbPb (pp) collisions and also satisfy the standard track quality requirements [38]. For both collision systems, it is required that the significance of the distance of closest approach to at least one primary vertex in the event be less than 3 standard deviations, in order to decrease the likelihood of counting nonprimary charged particles originating from secondary decay products. Tracks with p T > 20 GeV are required to have an associated energy deposit [47] of at least half their momentum in the calorimeters to reduce the contribution of misreconstructed tracks with very high p T . In PbPb collisions, tracks must additionally be associated with at least 11 hits and satisfy a fit quality requirement that the \u03c7 2 , divided by both the number of degrees of freedom and the number of tracker layers hit, be less than 0.15 [38]. The tracking efficiency in pp collisions is approximately 90% for p T > 1 GeV. Track reconstruction is more difficult in the heavy ion environment because of the large track multiplicity, and so the tracking efficiency ranges from approximately 60% at p T = 1 GeV to about 70% at p T = 10 GeV [38].",

Such jets, with no reconstructed tracks inside the jet cone, are excluded in the fitting procedure, and the fractions of quarks and gluons for such jets are assigned directly from simulation. The related systematic uncertainty is discussed in section 8. Previous CMS results have shown a large excess of soft particles in PbPb events relative to pp events up to \u2206r \u223c 1 from the jet axis, compensated by a relative depletion of higher-p T tracks [10,52].

The analysis uses lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collision data collected with the CMS detector at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The unfolded jet charge distributions, measured using the jet constituents with transverse momentum p T > 1 GeV for jets having p T > 120 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.5, are presented. The widths of the jet charge distributions for pp collisions are in good agreement with predictions from the event generator pythia6 and are shown to be independent of PbPb collision centrality. The jet charge distributions for quarkand gluon-initiated jets from pythia6 events are used as fitting templates to estimate the respective contributions in the measured jet samples. The gluon-like jet fractions extracted from these template fits are found to be similar between pp data and all studied PbPb centrality ranges. These are the first measurements in heavy ion collisions which exploit the electric charge of the initiating parton to discriminate between quark and gluon jets. No evidence is seen for a significant decrease (increase) in gluon-like (quark-like) prevalence in a sample of jets with p T > 120 GeV in PbPb collisions. These observations do not support recent interpretations of other heavy ion results [11,12], which are based on a decreased (increased) gluon (quark) fraction caused by color-charge dependent jet quenching.",
