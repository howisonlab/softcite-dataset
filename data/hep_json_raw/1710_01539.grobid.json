The data were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb \u22121 . The T and Y quarks are assumed to decay exclusively to a W boson and a b quark. The search is based on events with a single isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets with large transverse momenta. In the search, a kinematic reconstruction of the final state observables is performed, which would permit a signal to be detected as a narrow mass peak (\u22487% resolution). The observed number of events is consistent with the standard model prediction. Assuming strong pair production of the vector-like quarks and a 100% branching fraction to bW, a lower limit of 1295 GeV at 95% confidence level is set on the T and Y quark masses.",

Nonchiral VLQs appear in a number of beyond-the-SM scenarios, such as \"Randall-Sundrum\" and other extra-dimensional models [1,2]; the beautiful mirrors [3], little Higgs [4][5][6][7][8], and composite Higgs [9] models; grand unified theories [10]; and also other models that provide insights into the SM flavor structure [11]. These models provide possible solutions to a number of problems, such as electroweak symmetry breaking, a poor general fit to the precision electroweak data, the origin of flavor patterns, and the hierarchy problem. In particular, the hierarchy problem, namely the instability within the SM of the Higgs boson mass parameter to quantum corrections, can be solved through the introduction of VLQ contributions that cancel the contributions from the top quark.",

We consider the case in which this decay has a branching fraction B(T \u2192 bW) = 100%. Also in some models [13], a VLQ Y with an electric charge of \u22124/3 is predicted, either with E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. or without the presence of a T VLQ. The Y quark is expected to decay with a 100% branching fraction via the same bW channel. Since jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks and b antiquarks are not distinguished in this analysis, the results presented apply equally to the strong pair production of both T and Y VLQs. We consider the case where either only T quarks or only Y quarks are produced. This assumption produces a more conservative estimation of the lower mass limit on VLQs. Throughout the rest of this paper, we will use T to represent both the T and Y VLQs.",

The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb \u22121 . This analysis is an extension to higher mass values of an earlier CMS search for the T quark at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Both the previous analysis and the present one are based on a kinematic reconstruction with a constrained fit to the bWbW final state in the signal decay channel shown above. Kinematic reconstruction enables detection of the signal as a narrow mass peak. The previous results were combined with other CMS T quark searches in Ref. [14]. The present observed lower mass limits for a T quark decaying 100% via the bW channel are 920 GeV for CMS [14]  The search strategy requires that one of the W bosons decays leptonically, producing an electron or a muon accompanied by a neutrino, and the other decays hadronically to a quark-antiquark pair. We select events with a single isolated muon or electron, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets with high transverse momenta, arising from the hadronization of the quarks in the final state. We classify such events as \u03bc+jets or e+jets.",

Such merged jets are then resolved into two subjets by employing jet substructure techniques based on the \"soft drop\" grooming algorithm [17]. These resolved subjets are counted individually when selecting four-jet final states and contribute separately in the kinematic fit (see Section 5).

Table 1 presents the numbers of observed and predicted background events, normalized to the integrated luminosity. Selection efficiencies for the TT signal, including acceptance and branching fractions of decays, and the number of expected signal events are given in Table 2 as a function of the T quark mass. Fig. 1 shows the distributions of the T quark reconstructed mass, m reco , obtained from the selected \u03bc+jets and e+jets events, and Fig. 2 shows their sum. The integrated luminosity and cross sections of the background processes are used for normalization of the background contributions. Only the statistical uncertainties are shown for the estimated background, since the systematic uncertainties enter the workflow later and are not available at this point of the analysis. Nevertheless, it is evident that the data distributions are well described by the predicted backgrounds alone. The resolution of the reconstructed mass was found to be proportional to the value of the mass, with the Gaussian core of the m reco resolution curves having a width-to-mass ratio of \u22487%. We make use of this feature by employing variable bin widths equal to 7% of the bin-center values when plotting m reco and using a logarithmic scale for the horizontal axis. In this way, the bin widths appear to be of the same size, equal to the local mass resolution. This helps smooth statistical fluctuations causing peaks that are narrower than the local mass resolution, and avoid wrong interpretations when searching for narrow structures in the observed mass distribution. Fig. 2 (lower plot) shows the resulting m reco spectrum plotted this way for the sum of the \u03bc+jets and e+jets channels. The The lower plot has a logarithmic x-axis scale and the bin size corresponds to 7% of the mass value in the middle of the bin. The MC prediction for the pair production of a T quark with a mass of 1300 GeV is shown by a dashed line, enhanced by a factor of 20. The lower panels show the ratio of the data to the background prediction. The uncertainties represented by the vertical bars on the points are statistical only.

Shapes of the SM background and signal templates are changed (\"morphed\") in the limit-setting procedure according to the varying values of the shape nuisance parameters. Contributions from the SM processes are allowed to vary independently within their systematic uncertainties, using log-normal priors [50,51].

Fig. 4 (lower plot) shows the post-fit distribution of the reconstructed mass. From the upper cross section limits we set lower limits on the T quark mass.

Events are selected requiring that one W boson decays to a lepton and neutrino, and the other to a quark-antiquark pair. The selection requires a muon or electron, significant missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets. A kinematic fit assuming TT or YY production is performed and for every event a candidate T/Y quark mass m reco is reconstructed. The analysis provides a high-resolution (7%) mass scan of the bW spectrum in the range from the top quark mass up to \u22482 TeV, in which the signal from pair production of equal mass objects decaying to bW would show up in a model-independent way as a narrow peak. A binned maximum-likelihood fit to the m reco distribution is made and no significant deviations from the standard model expectations are found. Upper limits are set on the TT and YY pair production cross sections as a function of their mass. By comparing these limits with the predicted theoretical cross section of the pair production, the production of T and Y quarks is excluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 1295 GeV (1275 GeV expected). More generally, the results set upper limits on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction to bW for any new heavy quark decaying to this channel.",

Selected electrons should have |\u03b7| < 2.1. To ensure that the e+jets channel covers a similar kinematic phase space to the \u03bc+jets channel, electron candidates must satisfy the same p T > 55 GeV requirement. Simulation shows that lowering the p T threshold would not improve the signal significance.
