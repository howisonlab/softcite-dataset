[7,12,13] are R(D * ) = 0.322 \u00b1 0.018 \u00b1 0.012 and R(D) = 0.391 \u00b1 0.041 \u00b1 0.028 [14], which exceed the SM predictions by 3.0\u03c3 and 1.7\u03c3, respectively. The combined analysis of R(D * ) and R(D), taking into account measurement correlations, finds that the deviation is 3.9\u03c3 from the SM prediction [14]. So far, measurements of R(D ( * ) ) at the B factories have been performed using hadronic [7,12] or inclusive tagging methods [10,11]. Semileptonic tagging methods have been employed in studies of B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 decays and have been shown to have similar experimental precision to that of the hadronic tagging method [15,16]. In this paper, we report the first measurement of R(D * ) using the semileptonic tagging method. We reconstruct signal B 0B0 events in modes where one B decays semitauonically,B 0 \u2192 D * + \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 followed by \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 \u03bd \u03c4 (referred to hereinafter as B sig ), and the other B decays in a semileptonic channelB 0 \u2192 D * + \u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 (referred to hereinafter as B tag ). In order to form R(D * ), we also reconstruct normalization B 0B0 events in modes where both B mesons decay to D * + \u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 .",

We investigate the compatibility of the data samples with new physics using a model-independent approach, separately examining the impact of each operator. In each new-physics scenario, we take into account changes in the efficiency and fit PDF shapes using dedicated signal simulation. We set the Wilson coefficients to be real in all cases. Since O V1 is just the SM operator, it would change only R(D * ), but not the kinematic distributions. In the type-II two-Higgs doublet model Various leptoquark models have been presented to explain anomalies in R(D ( * ) ) in Ref. [4]. In addition to the model-independent study, we study two representative models: R 2 and S 1 . Model R 2 contains scalar leptoquarks of the type (3, 2) 7/6 using the notation (SU (3) c , SU (2) L ) Y , where SU (3) c is the representation under the generators of QCD, SU (2) L is the representation under the generators of weak isospin, and Y is the weak hypercharge. Model S 1 contains leptoquarks of the type (3 * , 1) 1/3 . In these leptoquark models, the relevant Wilson coefficients are related by C S2 = +7.8C T for the R 2 -type leptoquark model and C S2 = \u22127.8C T for the S 1 -type leptoquark model at the b quark mass scale, assuming a leptoquark mass scale of 1 TeV/c 2 . Although the V 1 operator can appear independently of the S 2 and T operators in the S 1 -type leptoquark model, we assume no contribution from the V 1 operator in this study. Figure 4 shows the dependence of the efficiency and measured value of R(D * ) as a function of the values of the respective parameters in the type-II 2HDM and the R 2 -type leptoquark model. Efficiency variations for other scenarios are shown in Ref. [32]. We find that efficiencies increase by up to 17% for O V2 and O T , mainly due to the variation of the D * momentum distribution. Similarly, the efficiencies increase by up to 16% and 11% in R 2 -and S 1 -type leptoquark models, respectively, which include contributions from O T . In other scenarios, the efficiency variation is 6% or less. Figure 5 shows the dependency of the measured values of R(D * ) on the values of the respective parameters in the type-II 2HDM and the R 2type leptoquark model. The allowed regions with 68% confidence level (C.L.) of the respective parameters are summarized in Table II. In Refs. [7] and [12], the q 2 \u2261 (p B \u2212 p D * ) 2 spectra are examined in order to study the effects of new physics beyond the SM. Since q 2 cannot be calculated here due to the neutrino in the decay of the B tag , we use instead the momenta of the D * and the \u2113 in B sig at the \u03a5(4S) rest frame. Figure 6 shows the momentum distributions of the background-subtracted data in the region of O NB > 0.8 and E ECL < 0.5 GeV for the SM, type-II 2HDM with tan \u03b2/m H + = 0.7 GeV \u22121 , and the R 2 -type leptoquark model with C T = +0.36. The PDF shapes of background events are taken from MC simulation and normalized to the yields obtained by the fitting. Table III shows p values for all scenarios, where we include only the statistical uncertainty. We find our data are compatible with the SM and additional contributions from scalar and vector operators; large additional contributions from tensor operator or the R 2 -and S 1 -type leptoquark models are disfavored.",

We investigate the compatibility of the data samples with new physics in a model-independent method by adding the operators one by one. We also study two types of leptoquark models. We find our data allow the additional contributions from scalar and vector operators while disfavoring large additional contributions from a tensor operator with +0.34 < C T < +0.39, an R 2 -type leptoquark model with +0.34 < C T < +0.38, or an S 1 -type leptoquark model with +0.22 < C T < +0.28, when considering the impact on the decay kinematics.
