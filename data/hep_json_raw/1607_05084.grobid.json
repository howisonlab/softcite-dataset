The current world average value is based on direct measurements of final state kinematic properties of W -boson decays, and has a relative uncertainty of 2%. The indirect determination of W via the cross-section measurements of vectorboson production can lead to a similar accuracy. The same methodology leads also to a determination of the leptonic branching ratio. This approach has been successfully pursued by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron collider, as well as by the CMS collaboration at the LHC. In this paper we present for the first time a combination of the available measurements at hadron colliders, accounting for the correlations of the associated systematic uncertainties. Our combination leads to values of BR(W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd) = (10.72 \u00b1 0.16)% and W = 2113 \u00b1 31 MeV, respectively, both compatible with the current world averages.",

As a matter of fact, the relation between the W -boson mass, m W , the top-quark mass, m t , and the Higgs-boson mass, m H , via loop corrections, allowed a prediction of the mass of the Higgs boson with an uncertainty smaller than 25 GeV. Models beyond the standard model could alter the relation between m W and m H , since new particles can appear in virtual loops.

They depend, among other parameters, on the topquark mass, m t , and the Higgs-boson mass, m H , and are small in the standard model (SM) since a large part of the corrections is absorbed in the measured values of G F = 1.1663787 (8)\u202210 \u22125 GeV \u22122 and m W = 80.385\u00b10.015 GeV. The radiative corrections correspond to \u03b4 rad \u2248 0.34% for leptons and of \u03b4 rad q \u2248 0.40% for quarks [2]. New particle candidates that couple to the W boson and are lighter than m W , would open a new decay channel and alter W . One very prominent example is supersymmetric models in which the W boson can decay to the lightest super-partner of the charged gauge bosons and the lightest super-partner of the neutral gauge bosons. Hence a precise measurement of W might reveal physics beyond the standard model. In addition, assuming standard model relations, the dependence of the partial and total widths of the W boson on the strongcoupling constant allows to determine the value of \u03b1 s from the hadronic and leptonic branching ratios of the W boson [3].",

The correlation of the \u03bc R and \u03bc F variations on the W -and Z -boson cross sections and acceptances can be treated according to various prescriptions. In the most conservative approach they are considered as fully uncorrelated, leading to an uncertainty of 0.5% on the predicted inclusive cross-section ratio. The uncertainty reduces by more than a factor of two when assuming a fully correlated behaviour. In the following we adopt an intermediate approach, and assume a correlation of 50%. In addition to these uncertainties, the acceptance factor ratio A W /A Z is also affected by other effects, which change the kinematic distribution of the final states, but has little effect on the inclusive cross sections. In particular, the uncertainties due to soft non-perturbative effects and initial-state radiation (ISR), which vary the transverse momentum spectrum of the vector boson, p T (V ), have to be estimated. To perform a conservative estimation, we reweight the predicted p T (V ) from Powheg+Pythia8 to corresponding predictions of the Resbos generator [26][27][28]. Resbos is based on a resummed calculation, which is performed at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order and matched to approximate NNLO perturbative QCD calculations at large boson momenta. The difference between the nominal Powheg+Pythia8 predictions of A W and A Z and the Resbos reweighted samples, is considered as an ISR and resummation uncertainty. The corresponding uncertainties on A W /A Z vary between 0.1% (ATLAS) and 0.4% (CMS). This difference can be explained by the larger effect on the W -boson selection for CMS, as it Table 1 The collider beams, the corresponding centre-of-mass energy, the fiducial volume definitions, the published inclusive cross-section ratio R, as well as the fiducial cross-section ratio R fid are given for each analysis used for the combination. The fiducial ratio was not published for the measurements of the CDF experiment and the extrapolated value is shown  requires only a minimum threshold on the p T of the decay muons. Furthermore, NLO electroweak corrections can be comparable in size to NNLO QCD corrections. We distinguish between the corrections due to QED final-state radiation (FSR) and loop-induced electroweak corrections (EWK). The QED FSR related uncertainties are estimated by comparing Sherpa [29] and Pythia8 [30], where the acceptances are derived for both generators using dressed and bare leptons. The resulting differences in the predicted acceptance ratios are taken as the QED FSR model uncertainty and amount to 0.1%. The uncertainties due to loop-induced electroweak corrections are taken from literature [31] and are accounted for by 0.1% variations on A W /A Z . We obtain 57 predictions for the cross-section ratios \u03c3 W /\u03c3 Z and the acceptance ratios A W /A Z , accounting for 50 MMHT PDF eigenvector variations, the central prediction of the CT10 PDF set, \u03bc R and \u03bc F scale variations, and variations of \u03b1 s . In addition, we have further uncertainties on A W /A Z due to ISR/resummation effects, QED FSR and NLO EWK effects. A summary of the cross-section ratios \u03c3 W /\u03c3 Z and acceptance ratios A W /A Z for each measurement, including the relevant model uncertainties, is given in Table 2. The PDF uncertainties are evaluated with the Hessian method [32].",

Assuming the validity of the SM, the partial leptonic W -boson width is predicted by Eq. (1), leading to W \u2192\u03bc\u03bd = 226.5 MeV, where the (1+\u03b4 rad ) corrections are taken from Ref. [2]. Finally, the total W -boson width can be derived from the measured leptonic branching ratios. The resulting values for W = BR\u2022 W \u2192\u03bc\u03bd for each experimental measurement are illustrated in Fig. 2 and reported in Table 4, together with the associated statistical, experimental systematic, and combined model uncertainties.",
