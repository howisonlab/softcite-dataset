The results are presented in three-dimensional bins of the Bjorken scaling variable x, the relative virtualphoton energy y, and the fraction z of the virtual-photon energy carried by the produced hadron. The data were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration by scattering 160 GeV muons off an isoscalar 6 LiD target. They cover the kinematic domain 1 (GeV/c) 2 < Q 2 < 60 (GeV/c) 2 in the photon virtuality, 0.004 < x < 0.4, 0.1 < y < 0.7, 0.20 < z < 0.85, and W > 5 GeV/c 2 in the invariant mass of the hadronic system. The results from the sum of the z-integrated K + and K \u2212 multiplicities at high x point to a value of the non-strange quark fragmentation function larger than obtained by the earlier DSS fit.",

            "text": "The study of strangeness in the nucleon has been arousing constant interest over the last decades, but the data sensitive to strangeness are still rather scarce. The parton distribution functions (PDFs) of strange quarks s(x) in the nucleon are not yet well constrained. The evaluation of the s-quark helicity distribution function s(x), where x denotes the fraction of longitudinal nucleon momentum carried by the quark, is particularly difficult. Different values are obtained for its first moment s when using two different methods. On the one hand, a substantially negative value is obtained from QCD fits of measurements of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) of a polarised beam on a polarised target, when assuming SU(3) flavour symmetry in the hyperon sector [1][2][3][4]. On the other hand, the values of s(x) extracted using only semi-inclusive DIS measurements (hereafter referred to as SIDIS) of identified kaons using polarised beam and target are found to be compatible with zero in the measured kinematic range [5][6][7]. The latter evaluations require knowledge of the collinear quark fragmentation functions (FFs), in particular knowledge of the quark-to-kaon FF. The values of the strange quark-to-kaon FF presently published differ by factors of up to three [8,9] and thus can lead to very different values of s(x) [4,6]. Note that the authors of Ref. [3] reconciled the two results by using a more flexible shape for s(x), which turned out to be negative at low x where no data exist and slightly positive at high x to accommodate SIDIS data. Quark FFs are of general interest by themselves, as they are non-perturbative universal functions describing processes leading to the production of hadrons.",

            "text": "The reason for the presently large uncertainties on the values of the strange quark-to-kaon FF is the lack of appropriate kaon data. Existing data on kaon production from e + e \u2212 annihilation [10] and pp collision [11] experiments are only weakly sensitive to the quark and anti-quark flavours individually. In contrast, SIDIS data allow for a full flavour decomposition of FFs [12]. Compared to the kinematic range of the only published SIDIS results, which originate from HERMES [13], COMPASS measurements cover a wider kinematic domain. In addition, they better satisfy the Berger criterion [14] that ensures the validity of factorisation in the description of SIDIS. Kaon multiplicities measured by COMPASS are thus expected to play an important role in future next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD analyses aiming to constrain quark-to-kaon FFs.",

The correction factors are calculated separately for denominator and numerator of Eq. 3, i.e. for the number of DIS events and the number of kaons, respectively. The Dubna TERAD code [17] is used for the DIS correction factor. For the kaon yields, the TERAD correction is calculated excluding the elastic and quasielastic tails. As TERAD cannot account for a z dependence, which leads to an overestimate of the correction, 23 a conservative approach is adopted here. The correction is calculated for the two extreme cases, no correction and full correction to the number of kaons entering the numerator; half of the correction is applied to the multiplicities.

A maximum uncertainty of 4% on the acceptance correction is derived from the following studies: varying the PDF set used, varying the JETSET parameters, using a fourdimensional space (x, y, z, p T ) with the hadron transverse momentum p T as fourth variable, varying the detector efficiency applied in the MC simulation used for the acceptance calculation, as well as comparing multiplicity results from upstream and downstream target regions. The RICH identification and unfolding procedure leads to uncertainties typically below 1.5%. The uncertainty on the diffractive meson correction factor is on average below 1.5%; it is estimated assuming 30% uncertainty on the cross section for exclusive production of \u03c6 mesons [28], which is used to normalise the HEPGEN MC calculation. Nuclear effects may be caused by the presence of 3 He/ 4 He and 6 Li in the target. A detailed study of such effects was previously performed by the EMC [29] in a kinematic range similar to COMPASS one, for carbon, copper and tin. A decrease of the multiplicities of 5% was observed for copper compared to deuterium. While the effect was larger for tin, no such effect was found for carbon within statistical accuracy, so that possible nuclear effects in the present experiment are expected to be very small and hence neglected. The dependence of the acceptance on the azimuthal angle is negligible [30]. No time dependence is observed in the results obtained in six weeks of data taking. Also, the present results are found in agreement with an independent set of preliminary data taken in 2004 before the upgrade of the spectrometer. We chose to publish only the present set of data, which is of better quality and benefits from a larger spectrometer acceptance and an upgraded RICH detector.",

In this section, results are shown first in the initial three-dimensional (x, y, z) binning, then averaged in y, and eventually also integrated over the z range from 0.2 to 0.85 in order to calculate the sum and ratio of K + and K \u2212 multiplicities vs x. The data presented in the following figures are all corrected for the diffractive vector-meson contribution as described in Sect. 2.4. For completeness, the numerical values are available on HepData [31] for multiplicities with and without this correction. The separate correction factors for DIS and kaon yields are also provided, as are the factors used for the correction of radiative effects. The bin limits in x, y, and z are given in Table 1.",

In Figs. 4 and 5, the results for the z and y dependences of the K + and K \u2212 multiplicities are presented separately for the nine ranges in x. Statistical uncertainties are shown for all points, while the band    on the bottom of the plots illustrates the size of the total systematic uncertainty for a single y range (0.30-0.50). For the other y ranges, the bands are similar or smaller in size. In Fig. 6, multiplicities of positive (closed circles) and negative (open circles) charged kaons are shown vs z, separately for the nine x ranges but averaged over y. The error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties and the bands to the total systematic ones. A strong dependence on z is observed as in previous measurements [26] and a weak one on x. The multiplicities are systematically higher for K + as compared to K \u2212 because of u-quark dominance and since K \u2212 do not contain valence quarks from the nucleon.",

The result for M K + +M K \u2212 is presented in Fig. 8 as a function of x at the measured values of Q 2 . The data are integrated over z in the range 0.20 to 0.85 and averaged over y in the range 0.1 to 0.7. Only those eight x bins which have a sufficient z coverage are shown. A weak x dependence is observed. Fig. 8 also shows the HERMES results [13] that were taken at 27.5 GeV beam energy and correspond to different kinematics in particular accepting lower W values. They lie well below the COMPASS points and exhibit a different x behaviour. The x dependence of the HERMES results for pion and kaon multiplicities gave rise to some dispute [33][34][35]. Note that COMPASS multiplicities are computed in bins of (x, y, z) before integration over z and averaging over y while in the case of HERMES, the hadron and DIS yields are obtained and integrated over separately, and finally combined in a ratio depending on x only [35].",
