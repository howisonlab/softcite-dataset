Observation of the \u039e ++ cc (ccu) baryon via decays to \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and \u039e + c \u03c0 + final states has been reported by the LHCb collaboration [4,5]. 1 The \u039e ++ cc mass was measured by the LHCb collaboration to be 3621.24 \u00b1 0.65 (stat) \u00b1 0.31 (syst) MeV/c 2 . Before the LHCb observation, theoretical calculations using quark models [6][7][8], bag models [9], the Faddeev method [10], quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules [11][12][13][14], potential models [15] and lattice QCD [16][17][18] predicted the mass of this state in the range 3450-3750 MeV/c 2 . Most of the predictions using quark models are around 3600 MeV/c 2 while other methods have a larger spread. Theoretical calculations of the \u039e ++ cc mass [19][20][21][22] after the LHCb observation fall into a \u00b120 MeV/c 2 window around the experimental value measured by LHCb.",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [23,24] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [25], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [26,27] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The momentum scale is calibrated using samples of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays collected concurrently with the data sample used for this analysis [28,29]. The relative accuracy of this procedure is estimated to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 using samples of other fully reconstructed b-hadron, \u03a5 and K 0 S decays. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp collision vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/(p T / GeV/c)) \u00b5m, where p T is the momentum component transverse to the beam axis. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [30]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [31].",

Since the selection is more efficient for candidates with larger reconstructed decay lengths, and the decay length is correlated with the mass by the effect of the multiple scattering, this can bias the \u039e ++ cc mass measurement.

This effect is studied with the simulation. To disentangle this effect from those due to reconstruction, the mass of the \u039e ++ cc candidates calculated with the true momenta of the final-state particles is smeared with different resolution values. The difference between the fitted and input mass values is studied as a function of the mass resolution, and the difference corresponding to the mass resolution in data is taken as a correction. Alternative signal models are also considered. The largest difference of the fitted mass with final-state radiation corrections between the nominal and the alternative is quoted as the uncertainty.

The uncertainties on the \u039b + c mass and on the mass difference between the \u039e + c and \u039b + c are propagated to the \u039e ++ cc mass measurement. The corresponding uncertainties on the \u039e ++ cc mass are 0.14 MeV/c 2 and 0.22 MeV/c 2 for the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay and the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039e + c \u03c0 + decay, respectively. The sources of systematic uncertainty considered in this analysis are summarised in table 1. When computing the total uncertainty, the uncertainty on the momentum-scale calibration of the \u039e + c mass from ref. [50] is assumed to be fully correlated to that of the \u039e ++ cc mass. The total systematic uncertainty is calculated by summing the individual sources of uncertainty in quadrature.",
