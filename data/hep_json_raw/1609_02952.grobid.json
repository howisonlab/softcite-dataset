The experiment used simultaneous K + and K \u2212 beams and was optimized for the search for direct CP violating charge asymmetries in the K \u00b1 \u2192 3\u03c0 \u00b1 decays [1]. Its successor, the NA62-R K experiment, collected a 10 times smaller K \u00b1 decay sample with low intensity beams and minimum bias trigger conditions in 2007 using the same detector [2]. The large data samples accumulated by the two experiments have allowed precision studies of rare K \u00b1 decays and searches for new physics. Recent results from these experiments are reported.",

An aluminium beam pipe of 158 mm outer diameter traversing the centre of the spectrometer (and all the following detectors) allowed the undecayed beam particles to continue their path in vacuum. The spectrometer consisted of four drift chambers (DCH) with an octagonal transverse width of 2.9 m: DCH1, DCH2 located upstream and DCH3, DCH4 downstream of a dipole magnet that provided a horizontal transverse momentum kick of 120 MeV/c for charged particles (for NA48/2). Each DCH was composed of eight planes of sense wires. The DCH space point resolution was 90 \u03bcm in both horizontal and vertical directions, and the momentum resolution was \u03c3 p /p = (1.02 \u2295 0.044 \u2022 p)%, with p expressed in GeV/c (for NA48/2). The spectrometer was followed by a plastic scintillator hodoscope (HOD) with a transverse size of about 2.4 m, consisting of a plane of vertical and a plane of horizontal strip-shaped counters arranged in four quadrants (each logically divided into four regions). The HOD provided time measurements of charged particles with 150 ps resolution. It was followed by a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter (LKr), an almost homogeneous ionization chamber with an active volume of 7 m 3 of liquid krypton, 27 X 0 deep, segmented transversally into 13248 projective \u223c 2 \u00d7 2 cm 2 cells.

The calorimeter was followed by a muon system consisting of three scintillator planes, with an iron wall installed in front of each plane.

Heavy Majorana neutrinos, which are possible mediators of LNV processes, arise in particular in the \u03bdMSM model [4] which introduces three heavy sterile neutrinos. The lightest of them has a mass of O(keV) and is a dark matter candidate, while the other two have masses ranging from 100 MeV to a few GeV. The model explains baryon asymmetry through CP-violating sterile neutrino oscillations and mixing with active neutrinos, and the low neutrino masses through see-saw mechanism. A simple extension of this model with a scalar field (the inflaton, \u03c7) also explains the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large scales and the existence of structures on smaller scales [5].",

            "text": "where F (x) is the semi-off-shell electromagnetic transition form factor (TFF) of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b4(x, y) encodes the radiative corrections. The TFF is usually expanded as F (x) = 1 + ax where a is the form factor slope parameter. This approximation is justified by the smallness of this parameter. In the vector meson dominance (VMD) model, it is dominated by the \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons, resulting in a slope of a \u2248 m 2 \u03c0 0 m \u22122 \u03c1 + m \u22122 \u03c9 /2 \u2248 0.03. A crucial aspect of measuring the \u03c0 0 TFF with the \u03c0 0 D decays is control of the radiative corrections in the differential rate: their effect on the differential decay rate exceed that of the TFF. The first study of the corrections on the differential rate was performed in [7] in the soft-photon approximation, and extended in [8]. A recent improved computation [9] largely triggered by and used for this analysis includes additional second-order contributions and accounts for the emission of radiative photons, i.e. the internal bremsstrahlung contribution.",

A \u03c7 2 fit to the reconstructed x distribution of the data \u03c0 0 D candidates with equipopulous binning has been performed to extract the TFF slope value (Fig. 3). The main systematic uncertainties arise from the simulation of the beam spectrum and from the calibration of the spectrometer global momentum scale. The preliminary result is a = (3.70 \u00b1 0.53 stat \u00b1 0.36 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , with \u03c7 2 /ndf = 52.5/49 corresponding to a p-value of 0.34.

In particular, a search for the dark photon (DP) production in the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3A decay followed by the prompt A \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay has been performed with the \u03c0 0 D data sample collected by the NA48/2 experiment [10]. No DP signal has been observed, providing improved upper limits on the mixing parameter \u03b5 2 in the mass range 9-70 MeV/c 2 . In combination with other experimental searches, this result ruled out the DP as an explanation for the muon (g \u2212 2) measurement under the assumption that the DP couples to quarks and decays predominantly to SM fermions.
