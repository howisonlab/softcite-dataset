We determine the dependence of the average of the measured \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 cross sections for deeply virtual Compton scattering on the squared four-momentum transfer t from the initial to the final proton. The slope B of the t-dependence is fitted with a single exponential function, which yields B = (4.3 \u00b1 0.6 stat + 0.1 \u2212 0.3 sys ) (GeV/c) \u22122 .

            "text": "The structure of the proton has been studied over half a century, still its understanding constitutes one of the very important challenges that physics is facing today. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interaction that governs the dynamics of quarks and gluons as constituents of the proton, is presently not analytically solvable. Lepton-proton scattering experiments have been proven to be very powerful tools to unravel the internal dynamics of the proton: (i) elastic scattering allows access to charge and current distributions in the proton by measuring electromagnetic form factors; (ii) deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) provides important information on the density distributions as a function of longitudinal momentum for quarks and gluons in the proton, encoded in universal parton distribution functions.",

            "text": "Deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), \u03b3 * p \u2192 \u03b3 p, is the production of a single real photon \u03b3 through the absorption of a virtual photon \u03b3 * by a proton p. This process combines features of the elastic process and those of the inelastic processes. Using the concept of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [1][2][3][4][5], it was shown [6][7][8][9] that in a certain kinematic domain DVCS allows access to correlations between transverse-position and longitudinalmomentum distributions of the partons in the proton. Here, longitudinal and transverse refer to the direction of motion of the initial proton facing the virtual photon. The measurement of DVCS probes the transverse extension of the parton density in the proton over the experimentally accessible region of longitudinal momentum of the active parton. Exploring the interplay between longitudinal and transverse partonic degrees of freedom by DVCS is often referred to as \"proton tomography\". The DVCS process is studied through exclusive single-photon production in lepton-proton scattering. The experimental results obtained so far are discussed in a recent review [10].",

The first electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL0) was placed directly downstream of the target to detect photons emitted at large polar scattering angles. Particles emitted through its central opening into the forward direction were measured using the open-field two-stage magnetic spectrometer. Each spectrometer stage comprised an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL1 or ECAL2), a hadron calorimeter, a muon filter for muon identification, and a variety of tracking detectors. A detailed description of the spectrometer can be found in Refs. [16][17][18]. The period of data taking was divided into several subperiods. After each subperiod, charge and polarisation of the muon beam were swapped simultaneously.

Here, neutral cluster specifies a cluster not associated to a charged particle. For ECAL0 any cluster is considered as neutral, as there are no tracking detectors in front. An outgoing charged particle that traverses more than 15 radiation lengths is considered to be a muon. The spectrometer information on incoming and scattered muons, as well as on position and energy measured for the neutral cluster, is used together with measured information from the time-of-flight system of the target-recoil detector. For a given event, the kinematics of all recoil proton candidates are compared with the corresponding predictions that are obtained using spectrometer information only.",

The first group contains symmetric contributions due to uncertainties in the determination of the beam flux, possible variations of the energy and momentum balance in the kinematic fit and the statistical uncertainty of the background subtraction. The second group contains systematic uncertainties related to corrections that were applied to the measured cross section. The subtracted amount of \u03c0 0 background is translated into an uni-directional systematic uncertainty of up to +12%, which is related to the detection of photons and originates from a possible bias on the low energy-thresholds of the electromagnetic calorimeters. As radiative corrections to the DVCS process are model dependent, they are not applied but instead also included as an uni-directional systematic uncertainty. The third group contains the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty. It is linked to the normalisation of the data in the large \u03bd-range with respect to the Bethe-Heitler contribution, when comparing data taking with positively and negatively charged muon beam. It is asymmetric and amounts to at most +19% and \u22129% for large values of |t|. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained as quadratic sum of all components shown in Table 2.",

At leading order in \u03b1 s and at leading twist, such analyses [35,33,[36][37][38]13] have already been performed in order to interpret the results of those experiments that access the high-x Bj region, i.e. mostly the valence-quark sector probed by HERMES and at JLab (see e.g. Ref. [13] for a list of experimental results). In such a global analysis, the Q 2 evolution and all necessary corrections have to be included that are required under the kinematic conditions of the respective experiments. Possibly, also results on exclusive-meson production may be included. Eventually, this may allow one to disentangle the contributions of the different parton species to the transverse size of the proton as a function of the average longitudinal momentum fraction carried by its constituents.",
