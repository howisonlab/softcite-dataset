For the calculation of the nuclear modification factor, the pp reference was obtained with an interpolation procedure including data at mid-rapidity from ALICE [15], PHENIX [16] and CDF [17]. L int = 51.4 \u00b5b \u22121 . More details of the analysis can be found in [7] for the Pb-Pb analysis and in [18] for the p-Pb analysis. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the p T -integrated nuclear modification factor R AA from Pb- Pb collisions at mid-rapidity as a function of the average number of participating nucleons N part . The ALICE results [7] are compared to measurements by PHENIX in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [8]. The results for central collisions are significantly different, with the ALICE data showing a factor of three less suppression than the PHENIX results. Also the PHENIX results indicate a strong centrality dependence, with a suppression increasing with centrality, whereas the ALICE results are compatible with no centrality dependence. The same behaviour is seen at forward rapidity [22]. The pt dependence of the J/\u03c8 R AA for the 40% most central collisions is shown in the right panel of Fig. 1. Our data is compared to PHENIX results in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [3], CMS results at higher p T [10] and model calculations [11,12]. The ALICE data suggests a much lower degree of suppression at low p T compared to lower energy measurements. Our data is well described by transport model predictions by Zhao et al. [12]. Newer predictions by Zhou et al. [11] are systematically below the measurement and exhibit a p T dependence similar to the one in the data. The model calculations show substantial theoretical uncertainties due to the limited knowledge of charm cross section and cold nuclear matter effects at LHC energies. Another experimental observable adopted to gain further insight on charmonium production mechanisms is the mean transverse momentum p T of J/\u03c8 produced in different collisions systems. ALICE measurements [9] have shown that the p T for Pb-Pb collisions is significantly smaller than that for pp collisions. Such a behaviour is not observed at smaller centre-ofmass energies from meausrements by PHENIX and NA50, for which no significant system size dependence of p T is seen. This might indicate the onset of processes which either deplete the high p T region or enhance the J/\u03c8 production at low p T in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The latter effect would be expected as a consequence of a significant contribution from charmonium recombination.",

Using 2 \u2192 1 (gg \u2192 J/\u03c8) kinematics, in Pb-Pb collisions the probed range is 7.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 < x < 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and in p-Pb collisions 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 < x < 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Under the assumption that shadowing is the main CNM-related mechanism that plays a role in the charmonium production and that its effect on the two colliding nuclei in Pb-Pb collisions can be factorized, the squared nuclear modification factor R 2 pPb can be considered as an estimate of CNM effects in Pb-Pb collisions [23,24].",

These differences suggest that the J/\u03c8 suppression in Pb-Pb collisions cannot be explained by CNM effects alone. The data at low p T hint at the presence of charmonium production in Pb-Pb consistent with (re)combination scenarios, whereas at high p T suppression effects seem to be present in the hot medium.",

Uniquely at the LHC, these measurements reach down to p T = 0. In Pb-Pb collisions, a suppression of J/\u03c8 production is observed, with no strong centrality dependence and a weak suppression at low transverse momentum. The results are in contrast to measurements at RHIC energies, which show an increase of the suppression with centrality, especially at low p T . Our data can be well described by theoretical models which take into account a (re)combination component in the J/\u03c8 production.",
