The partial-wave analysis (PWA) of these high-precision data reveals previously unseen details. The PWA, which is currently limited by systematic uncertainties, is based on an isobar model, where multi-particle decays are described as subsequent two-body decays and where a prior-knowledge parametrization for the intermediate two-pion resonances has to be assumed -usually a Breit-Wigner amplitude -thus increasing systematic uncertainties, due to the concrete choice of the parametrization. We present a novel method, which allows to extract isobar amplitudes directly from the data in a less biased way. The focus lies on the scalar \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 subsystem, where a previous analysis found a signal for a new axial-vector state a 1 (1420) decaying into f 0 (980)\u03c0.",

Fig. 1 shows the two-dimensional intensity distribution |T wave (m 3\u03c0 , m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )| 2 for this wave for two bins in t \u2032 . The most striking feature is a peak corresponding to the decay \u03c0(1800) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03c0. A smaller peak corresponding to \u03c0(1800) \u2192 f 0 (1500) \u03c0 \u2212 is also visible. Broad structures appear at low 2\u03c0 and 3\u03c0 masses and low t \u2032 , which are probably of mostly non-resonant origin. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the intensity distributions and Argand diagrams as a function of m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in narrow m 3\u03c0 bins around the \u03c0(1800) resonance. Peaks and phase motions corresponding to the f 0 (980) and the f 0 (1500) are visible.

The two-dimensional intensity distribution is shown in Fig. 4 for two t \u2032 bins. It features a dominant broad structure at low 2\u03c0 and 3\u03c0 masses, which moves with t \u2032 , indicating a predominantly non-resonant origin. In addition, a narrow peak at m 3\u03c0 \u2248 1.4 GeV/c 2 and a m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2248 0.98 GeV/c 2 is visible. It corresponds to the recently discovered a 1 (1420) [3]. The observation of this peak in tha freed-isobar analysis proves that the a 1 (1420) signal is not an artifact of the parametrization of the scalar isobars in the conventional analysis [3]. Fig. 5 shows the 2\u03c0 intensity distributions below, on, and above a 1 (1420), which exhibits a strong correlation with the f 0 (980) peak. A comparison of the f 0 (980) mass region from the freed-isobar fit is in good agreement with the intensity of the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980)\u03c0P wave from the conventional PWA (see Fig. 6). ",
