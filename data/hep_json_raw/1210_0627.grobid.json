With the CDF measurement of W + b production exceeding significantly the NLO prediction, while the ATLAS result is in agreement with the expectation, an independent measurement is important to understand the production of W bosons in association with b jets at hadron colliders. The data used in this analysis were collected between July 2006 and December 2010 using the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 6.1 fb \u22121 . We first briefly describe the main components of the D0 Run II detector [5] relevant to this analysis. The D0 detector has a central tracking system consisting of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) [ trigger efficiencies are approximately 70% for the muon channel and 95% for the electron channel. The simulation is corrected for the trigger efficiencies measured in data as described in Ref. [9]. calorimeter by comparing the longitudinal and transverse shower profiles to those of simulated electrons. The showers must be spatially isolated from other energetic particles, deposit most of their energy in the EM part of the calorimeter, and pass a likelihood criterion that includes a spatial track match. In the central detector region, an E/p requirement is applied, where E is the energy of the calorimeter cluster and p is the momentum of the track. The transverse momentum measurement of electrons is based on calorimeter energy information [9]. The electron reconstruction efficiency within our restricted phase space is about 98%.",

The V + jets (V = W /Z ) processes are normalized to the inclusive W and Z -boson cross sections calculated at NNLO [16].

To reproduce the W -boson p T distribution in simulated events, the product of the measured Z -boson p T spectrum and the ratio of W to Z -boson p T distributions at NLO is used as correction [17,18].",

The instrumental background is important for the electron channel, where a jet with a high electromagnetic fraction can pass electron identification criteria, or a photon can be misidentified as an electron. In the muon channel, the multijet background is less significant and arises mainly from the semileptonic decay of heavy quarks in which the muon satisfies the isolation requirements. We require that the W boson candidates have a transverse mass M T [22] satisfying 40 GeV + 1 2 / E T < M T < 120 GeV to suppress multijet background and mis-reconstructed events. The average efficiency determined in simulation for a W + b signal to pass these requirements is about 82%.",

            "text": "Identification of b jets is crucial for this measurement. Once the inclusive W + jets sample is defined, the jets considered for b tagging are subject to a requirement called taggability. This requirement is imposed to decouple the performance of the b-jet identification from detector effects. For a jet to be taggable, it must contain at least two tracks with at least one hit in the SMT, p T > 1 GeV for the highest-p T track and p T > 0.5 GeV for the next-to-highest p T track. The efficiency for a jet to be taggable is about 90% in the selected phase space. The D0 b-tagging algorithm for identifying heavy flavor jets is based on a combination of variables sensitive to the presence secondary vertices (SV) or tracks displaced from the PV. This analysis uses an updated b tagger utilizing a multivariate analysis (MVA) [23,24] that provides improved performance over the previous neural network based algorithm [25]. The most sensitive input variables to the MVA are the number of reconstructed secondary vertices in the jet, the invariant mass of charged particles associated with the SV (M SV ), the number of tracks used to reconstruct the SV, the two-dimensional decay length significance of the SV in the plane transverse to the beam, a weighted combination of the tracks' transverse impact parameter significances, and the probability that the tracks from the jet originate from the PV, which is referred to as the jet lifetime probability (JLIP). The MVA provides a continuous output value that tends towards one for b jets and zero for non-b jets. Events are considered in which at least one jet passes a tight MVA requirement corresponding to an efficiency of \u2248 50% for b jets. The likelihood for a light jet (u, d, s quarks and gluons) to be misidentified for the corresponding MVA selection is about 1%. Simulated events are corrected to have the same efficiencies for taggability and b-tagging requirements as found in data. These corrections are derived in a flavor dependent manner [25], using independent QCD enriched data samples and simulated events with enriched light and heavy jet contributions. Jets containing b quarks have a different energy response and receive an additional energy correction of about 6% as determined from simulation. Fig. 1 shows the transverse mass of the candidate events before and after applying b-jet identification.",

The contributions from jet energy resolution, jet modeling, and detector effects are about 2.5%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.

Offline event selection requires a reconstructed primary pp interaction primary vertex (PV) that has at least three associated tracks and is located within 60 cm of the center of the detector along the beam direction. The vertex selection for W + b events is about 97% efficient as measured in simulations.Electrons are identified using calorimeter and tracking information. The selection requires exactly one electron with transverse momentum p e T > 20 GeV identified by an electromagnetic (EM) shower in the central (|\u03b7 e | < 1.1) or endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7 e | < 2.5)",
