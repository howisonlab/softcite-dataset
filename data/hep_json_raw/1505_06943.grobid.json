The strong and electromagnetic forces conserve these symmetries. The weak interaction violates P , C, CP , and T , however the combination CP T is found to be conserved by experimental observations made so far. CP has been found to be violated in weak interactions involving quark transitions, and the quest for the complementary effect with neutrinos has started via combinations of data from all possible sources; several new experiments have been proposed that may constrain or measure the CP phase for the neutrino sector. Several tests of CP and CP T have been performed using charged leptons, in particular \u03c4 decay studies of decays to K S \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd and the mass difference between \u03c4 + and \u03c4 \u2212 , respectively [1]. The underlying reasons behind the observed pattern of behaviour is not established, however the observed phenomena have been parameterised within the Standard Model of particle physics (SM).",

            "text": "Triple product asymmetries have been used to probe for CP violation in a number of different systems, for example see [2,3] and references therein. One can use the momenta (or spins) of final state particles in four body decays of some mother particle M to a state abcd to compute a scalar triple product p c \u2022 ( p a \u00d7 p b ). The asymmetry of Eq. (1) can be computed either integrating over positive (+) and negative (\u2212) values of the triple product, or as a function of \u03c6, the angle between the decay planes defined by ab and cd. The scalar triple product is even under C and odd under P and CP transformations. It is also odd under T , however it is not possible to identify physical pairings of \u03c8 and \u03c8 for M \u2192 abcd. Some of the literature chooses to invoke CP T in order to trivially relate CP violation to a T violation and call these CP violating triple product asymmetry measurements T violating. With such a mind set one ignores the full set of tests that can be performed and chooses the limiting case where all CP violation signals might equally be called T violation. For such an approach there is simply no point in making the distinction between triple product CP tests and other CP violation manifestations, hence no point in discussing T violation. For some time a more general approach has been advocated in the literature, and in recent years experiment has gone beyond the limiting case of CP T conservation for a number of measurements. The invocation of CP T conservation is no longer reasonable for a general discussion of discrete symmetry violations. The latter part of these proceedings discuss tests of CP , T and CP T symmetries, and these proceedings regard CP violating triple products to be just that. It is worth noting that for entangled systems one could define \u03c8 and \u03c8 under a T or CP T transformation and hence study triple products using decays of M M \u2192 (abcd)(ef gh) as well as mixing CP filters with the four body decays in analogy with the methodology outlined in Section 3. We do not discuss this possibility further here as there have not been any attempts to perform such a measurement thus far, however this is a further reason to ensure clarity of the language used when talking about symmetry violations 1 . Figure 1 illustrates the decay M \u2192 abcd and the corresponding P , C and CP transformed processes. The T transformed process abcd \u2192 M never happens and is not shown.",

In general these asymmetries receive contributions from all interactions, and the interest is in isolating effects that are dominated by weak interactions (i.e. theoretically clean), or where that may not be possible, to isolate effects that can either be understood in the longer term, or signify a non-trivial weak interaction effect even in the presence of pollution from strong force induced final state interactions (i.e. soft QCD or re-scattering).

            "text": "Since the advent of the LHC it has been possible to entertain the prospects of analysing data involving Z or H boson decay, or associated production of pairs of bosons (ZH, W H, HH, etc.) that subsequently decay into a four particle final state. The SM predictions for C and CP effects are clear for all of these transitions -the associated asymmetries should be zero as non-zero violations arise from W boson interaction with up and down type quark fields. It is possible to estimate the precision with which the LHC can measure asymmetries for a number of modes based on the available Run 1 publications, and expectations through to the high luminosity LHC phase expected to start in the a decade from now. One of the most straightforward measurements to make is that of a Z or H boson decay to four leptons; + \u2212 + \u2212 . The final states where = have the largest rate and no ambiguity in terms of combinatorics of the signal reconstruction. The LHC has observed both Z 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 e + e \u2212 [16] and H \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 e + e \u2212 [17,18]. Expectations for the precision attainable for the triple product asymmetry measurement in these processes are given in Table 1. Percent-level precision could be achieved at the end of the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) assuming that trigger rates can be maintained and systematic uncertainties can be controlled in reconstructing these final states. Final states where = have rates a factor of two smaller than those for = , and may also suffer from a small dilution coming from ambiguities in reconstruction of the final states. Hence one can expect that the 4 modes, where = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 , have precisions at least \u221a 2 larger than the estimates shown in the table. Another potential channel of interest is the associated production of a H boson in conjunction with a W or Z. The use of triple product asymmetries to probe NP is W H decays has been discussed in Ref. [19]. The latest experimental searches from the LHC are reported in [20,21]. It might be possible to find evidence for these decays during Run 2. If that were to happen one could start to measure triple product asymmetries for combinations of H boson couplings with a W or Z. The proposed ILC is expected to accumulate large samples of ZH bosons, and assuming the yields outlined in [22] we would expect a statistical precision of 2.1 (3.7)% and 2.5 (4.7)% to be attainable on the asymmetry of Eq. (6) using inclusive (exclusive) Z decays to lepton pairs at 250 and 500 GeV, respectively. The proposed Chinese Higgs Factory (CEPC) aims to integrate a sample of about 1 million ZH decays [23]. If built the proposed Future Circular e + e \u2212 Collider (FCC-ee) would accumulate similar statistics. Such a sample size could be used to archive a precision about a factor of five times better than that of the ILC.",

This permits two tests to be performed: the comparison of M 0 \u2192 M 0 with the CP and T conjugate process M 0 \u2192 M 0 ; the comparison of M 0 \u2192 M 0 with the CP and CP T conjugate process M 0 \u2192 M 0 . These two tests are typically characterised by reconstructing same sign and opposite sign di-lepton final states in order to measure A CP,T and A CP,CP T , respectively [26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. Some measurements have also been performed using hadronically tagged flavour filters to complement those of semi-leptonic decays. The study of hadronically tagged decays is motivated by the fact that the semi-leptonic decay results are dominated by systematic uncertainties at the B Factories. In particular measurements of A CP,T at the B Factories mirror efforts by CPLEAR to measure T violation via the so-called Kabir asymmetry method [33,34]. The Tevatron and LHC experiments measure semi-leptonic asymmetries to perform these tests, see for example Ref. [35]. It is interesting to note that these measurements serve as simultaneous tests of two symmetries at a time [c.f. the type (iii) triple product asymmetry above] and are constructed using only the flavour basis pairing. Experimental results from the B Factories on A CP,T and A CP,CP T measurements can be found in Chapter 17.5 of [1] and references therein. Twelve asymmetries can be constructed as outlined by Bernabeu et al. in Refs. [36,37,38,39,40]. The full set of reference and conjugate pairs used to test CP , T and CP T are listed in Table 3. These are each tests of a single symmetry by virtue of invoking both flavour and CP filter basis pairs reconstructed from the decays of the two mesons. Figure 2 illustrates this for the reference process B 0 \u2192 B \u2212 under the symmetry T . The conjugate pairing to this under T interchanges the initial and final states. The B 0 meson in the reference process is tagged by the decay of the other B in the event being filtered by an + X decay and the B \u2212 filter is identified through the channel J/\u03c8K S . The T conjugate of this scenario requires that the B \u2212 be tagged by the decay of the other B in the event filtered via the channel J/\u03c8K L , and the B 0 is identified by the flavour filter channel \u2212 X. It is not sufficient in this case to just consider the interchange of initial and final states, one also has to consider how to filter on the flavour and CP components in order to correctly construct the desired asymmetry test.",

One can relate the S and C parameters to the real and imaginary parts of \u03bb = (q/p)(A/A), where q and p are mixing parameters and A/A is the ratio of amplitudes for antiparticle and particle decays to CP conjugate final states.

It has been noted that one has to take care in defining the operators used to test symmetries when CP T is relaxed. A potential consequence of this is a second interpretation of the BABAR results; it is possible that those results are a sign of CP T violation masquerading as fake T violation [4]. The BABAR interpretation of the data is the more conservative approach, and it will be very interesting to see the results of complementary measurements made by Belle II in the fullness of time in case this might shed light on the interpretational ambiguity.",

These effects are accommodated in the SM Lagrangian, however a deep understanding of the origin of these phenomena eludes us. The potential to learn something new requires a next generation of innovative and exhaustive measurements in the hope that some may go beyond our current expectations and hint at a deeper truth. The combined symmetry of CP T has important ramifications, and as a consequence we require CP T to be conserved if Lorentz symmetry is respected in nature. While one expects to find that this symmetry is conserved, at some point we believe that CP T violation may be manifest (for example in theories of quantum gravity). These measurements are important to make as the implications, should we find CP T violation, would be far reaching for modern physics. The use of triple product asymmetries in testing symmetry violation for different final states may yield a deeper insight into the weak interaction. Likewise the use of entangled meson systems at experiments will continue to enhance our understanding of violations of these discrete symmetries. By systematically probing a broad range of observables spanning quarks, leptons and bosons one hopes that the data may point to a more complete understanding of nature.",
