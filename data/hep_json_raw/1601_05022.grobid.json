In an exposure equivalent to 2.74 \u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target in the upgraded NuMI beam at Fermilab, we observe 6 events in the Far Detector, compared to a background expectation of 0.99 \u00b1 0.11 (syst.) events based on the Near Detector measurement. A secondary analysis observes 11 events with a background of 1.07 \u00b1 0.14 (syst.). The 3.3\u03c3 excess of events observed in the primary analysis disfavors 0.1\u03c0 < \u03b4CP < 0.5\u03c0 in the inverted mass hierarchy at the 90% C.L.",

            "text": "This Letter reports the first NOvA measurement of the oscillation of muon neutrinos (\u03bd \u00b5 ) into electron neutrinos (\u03bd e ) at the first oscillation maximum. The oscillation probability to first order is proportional to sin 2 2\u03b8 13 , which is well measured by reactor experiments [1]. Accelerator experiments measuring \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations differ from reactor experiments in that they are sensitive to three physical parameters that are currently unknown or poorly known [2]: sin 2 \u03b8 23 , which determines the coupling of \u03bd \u00b5 to the third neutrino mass state; \u03b4 CP , which determines the extent to which CP symmetry is violated in the neutrino sector; and the ordering of the neutrino masses, specifically whether the masses of the solar doublet are smaller (normal hierarchy, NH) or larger (inverted hierarchy, IH) than the third neutrino mass. The mass hierarchy may be determined by observing an enhancement (NH) or suppression (IH) of the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation probability caused by coherent forward scattering of electron neutrinos on electrons in the earth [3]. For a fixed ratio of baseline to neutrino energy, this effect increases with the experiment's baseline. Previous accelerator measurements of this oscillation mode have been reported by MINOS [4] and T2K [5]. The NOvA ex-periment has the longest baseline of any past or present accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment.",

They are arranged in planes with the long cell dimension alternating between the vertical and horizontal orientations. The FD (ND) contains 896 (192) planes with a total mass of 14 kt (193 t). To enhance muon containment, the downstream end of the ND has an additional ten layers of 10-cm-thick steel plates interleaved with pairs of one vertical and one horizontal plane of scintillator cells. In the fiducial region of the detectors, the liquid scintillator comprises 62% of the detector mass. The signal from each liquid scintillator cell is read out through a single wavelength-shifting fiber. The fiber is looped at the far end of the cell, and both near ends of the fiber terminate on the same pixel of a 32-pixel avalanche photodiode (APD) [11]. The APD signal is continuously integrated, shaped, then digitized. Signals above a preset threshold are sent to a buffer pending a trigger decision [12]. All signals within a 550 \u00b5s window around the 10 \u00b5s NuMI spill are recorded. Signals from periodic time windows asynchronous to the beam spill are also recorded to collect cosmic rays for calibration.",

The allowed variation in this effective parameter encompasses recent measurements [35][36][37][38] and is a proxy for possible multinucleon processes not included in the interaction model [39][40][41][42]. Dominant sources of uncertainty affecting the background prediction include a 5% uncertainty on both the absolute energy calibration and the inter-detector energy calibration, uncertainty in the modeling of scintillator saturation by highly ionizing particles [43], and modeling of the neutrino flux. The error incurred by scaling each background component by the same amount, instead of employing a data-driven decomposition of the background components, is estimated by individually scaling each background component to account for the entire difference between data and simulation. An overall normalization uncertainty on both signal and background levels in the FD comes from a survey of the mass of the materials used in the ND relative to the FD, combined with uncertainty in the measurement of POT delivered as well as a small difference between data and simulation in the efficiency for reconstructing events. Other considerations include possible biases arising from different containment criteria in the ND relative to the FD, imperfect removal of uncontained vertex events, and limited statistics in both the simulation and the ND data set. Adding all the effects in quadrature gives a 17.6% (15.0%) systematic uncertainty on the signal prediction and a 10.8% (13.4%) systematic uncertainty on the background prediction for the primary (secondary) selection technique.",

The observation corresponds to a 3.3\u03c3 excess over the background prediction. With the secondary event selection, we observe 11 events, a 5.3\u03c3 excess over the background prediction of 1.07 \u00b1 0.14 (syst.). All the events selected by the primary selector are in the sample selected by the secondary. Using the trinomial probability distribution and the number of simulated events that overlap between the selectors or are selected by each exclusively, we compute a 7.8% probability of observing our Calorimetric energy (GeV) particular overlap configuration or a less likely configuration. Figure 2 shows the energy distribution in the FD for events selected by either selection technique compared to the predicted spectrum with oscillation parameters as given in [31]. The likelihood for a Poisson distributed variable is used to compare the observed number of events to that predicted for a particular set of oscillation parameters. Figure 3 shows the values of \u03b4 CP and sin 2 2\u03b8 13 consistent with the observed number of events in the data for each of the selectors. Following the procedure of Feldman and Cousins [44], we determine confidence intervals by inspecting the range of likelihood ratios observed in pseudoexperiments. Uncertainties in signal and background predictions, in the solar oscillation parameters, and in the atmospheric mass splitting [45] are included in the generation of these pseudo-experiments, while sin 2 \u03b8 23 is fixed at 0.5. The data selected by the primary selector are compatible with three-flavor oscillations at the reactor value of \u03b8 13 . The number of events selected by the secondary selector favors a higher value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 for sin 2 \u03b8 23 fixed at 0.5, or alternatively a higher value of sin 2 \u03b8 23 for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 constrained to the reactor measurement. Figure 4 shows the compatibility between the observation and the number of events expected as a function of the mass hierarchy and \u03b4 CP if we additionally assume the reactor constraint of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.086 \u00b1 0.005 [1]. The maximal mixing constraint is also removed, and uncertainty in sin 2 \u03b8 23 is included in the generation of the pseudo-experiments [45]. For each value of \u03b4 CP and choice of hierarchy we compute the likelihood ratio to the best fit parameters and show the fraction of pseudo- experiments which have a larger or equal likelihood ratio, converted into a significance. The discontinuities are due to the discrete set of possible event counts. The range of 0.1\u03c0 < \u03b4 CP < 0.5\u03c0 in the IH is disfavored at the 90% C.L. The number of events selected by the secondary analysis is larger than the number of events expected given the range of oscillation parameters favored in global fits [46], but 13% of pseudo-experiments generated at the NOvA best fit find at least as many events as observed in the data. With the secondary selector all values of \u03b4 CP in the IH are disfavored at greater than 90% C.L. The range of 0.25\u03c0 < \u03b4 CP < 0.95\u03c0 in the NH is disfavored at the 90% C.L.",
