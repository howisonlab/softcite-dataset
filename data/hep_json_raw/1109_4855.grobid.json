As a result of advances in the performance of novel superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerator technology, the electron beam has exceeded the original 4 GeV energy specification, and beams with energies up to 6 GeV with currents up to 100 \u00b5A have been delivered for the experimental program. In addition, the development of advanced GaAs photoemission sources has enabled high quality polarized beam with polarizations up to 85%. The facility serves an international scientific user community of over 1200 scientists, and to date over 160 experiments have been completed.",

These activities generally fall into one of two general approaches. One is to advance the high energy frontier with higher energy particle accelerators in an attempt to obtain evidence for new particles that can be produced at higher energy. This is the approach that has recently been employed at the Tevatron at Fermilab and will in the future be the primary focus of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The other method is to perform high precision measurements at lower energies to provide information that can indicate the properties of a more complete theory. Indeed, such precision measurements yield complementary information to that which can be obtained at the energy frontier. For a review of this approach, including discussion of parity-violating electron scattering, see [1].",

This experiment would utilize a low current electron beam (< 1 \u00b5A) at 4-11 GeV on a tungsten target (0.14-1% r.l.). Down- stream of the target will be a dipole analyzing magnet (0.917 T-m), followed by silicon trackers (12 planes over 1 m length), an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a muon detector (steel plates with scintillation hodoscopes). The dipole magnet will spread the high flux of radiation from the target into a \"sheet of flame\", and the detectors must be split to transmit these particles and still operate in a high rate environment. The unique features of this experiment include the capability to detect pairs from decays downstream of the target (longer lifetime A corresponding to lower values of \u03b5) and the ability to also detect muon pairs.",

In particular, the remarkable and unique electron beam quality at Jefferson Lab enables a powerful new experimental program that offers opportunities for discovery of new physics beyond the standard model. Previous experience with parityviolation experiments provides a foundation for higher precision measurements with a physics reach comparable or exceeding the Large Hadron Collider. The development of detector systems capable of high luminosity operation with open geometry at Jefferson Lab now enables well-motivated searches for new vector gauge bosons that are favored in many dark matter scenarios. This new program effectively utilizes the existing infrastructure at the Laboratory but also requires the construction of new experimental apparatus.",
