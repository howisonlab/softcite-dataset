The results are based on a data sample containing 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs recorded at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider. AFB for the inclusive B \u2192 Xs\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 is extrapolated from the sum of 10 exclusive Xs states whose invariant mass is less than 2 GeV/c 2 . For q 2 > 10.2 GeV 2 /c 2 , AFB < 0 is excluded at the 2.3\u03c3 level, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation. For q 2 < 4.3 GeV 2 /c 2 , the result is within 1.8\u03c3 of the Standard Model theoretical expectation.",

The corresponding decay amplitude can be expressed via the Operator Product Expansion [2] in terms of the effective Wilson coefficients for the electromagnetic penguin, C eff 7 , and the vector and axial-vector electroweak contributions, C eff 9 and C eff 10 , respectively [3]. If physics beyond the SM contributes to b \u2192 s\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decays, then the effective Wilson coeffi-cients are expected to differ from the SM expectations. Therefore the decay rate and angular distributions of b \u2192 s\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decays constitute good probes to search for new physics [4].",

The combinato-rial background is modeled by an ARGUS function [26], where the endpoint is fixed to the nominal beam energy in the \u03a5(4S) rest frame, E * beam = 5.289 GeV.

Systematic uncertainties for A FB are summarized in Table III. In the 1st q 2 bin, the dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the translation of A raw FB to A FB with \u03b1 and \u03b2. Even if a MC sample with a different set of Wilson coefficients produces the same values of A FB , the A raw FB values and hence the \u03b1 coefficient may differ. It gives rise to an uncertainty of the offset in the linear fit. To estimate this uncertainty, the relation between A raw FB and A FB are projected onto the axis perpendicular to the fitted linear line and fitted by a Gaussian function. To estimate systematic uncertainties from the peaking background, the yield of each such background is varied by its uncertainty. For the charmonium peaking background, the yield is varied by \u00b1100%, conservatively, because it is determined from MC events. A possible peaking background from B \u2192 Kn\u03c0\u2113\u03bd (n > 0), where one pion is misidentified as a lepton and the missing neutrino is compensated by a pion of the other B decay, is examined. The number of events in the whole q 2 region is estimated from MC to be 0.2 \u00b1 0.6 (1.1 \u00b1 0.7) for electron (muon) channel, and the resulting systematic error is O(0.001).

A FB for the inclusive B \u2192 X s \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 is extrapolated from the sum of 10 exclusive X s states, assuming A FB depends neither on the lepton flavor nor on the X s mass. For q 2 > 10.2 GeV 2 /c 2 , A FB < 0 is excluded at the 2.3\u03c3 level. For q 2 < 4.3 GeV 2 /c 2 , the result is within 1.8\u03c3 of the SM expectation. The results can be used to constrain various extensions of the SM.",
