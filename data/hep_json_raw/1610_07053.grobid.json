Event reweighting is a key analysis technique, used to efficiently study the effect of neutrino interaction model uncertainties. This opens up the possibility for NuWro to be used as a primary event generator by experimental analysis groups. A preliminary model tuning to ANL and BNL data of quasi-elastic and single pion production events was performed to validate the reweighting engine.",

NuWro contains a wide variety of models and tuneable parameters, but until now it has had no facility to perform event reweighting. This has limited its use by experimental groups for anything more than final crosssection prediction comparisons. NuWro ReWeight was written to facilitate the use of NuWro at current and future neutrino interaction experiments.",

            "text": "Event generation is an inherently inefficient process. Generated event properties must be distributed correctly according to the model used. This is often achieved by rejection sampling: randomly throwing sets of interaction properties and accepting interactions with a probability proportional to the predicted cross-section for that event. When tuning free model parameters to data, many sets of model predictions must be generated to investigate how the model fits the data. It is often advantageous to 'reweight' model predictions to determine the response of varying free parameters rather than fully recalculating them. Each generated event comes with an associated 'weight' which is proportional to the probability for that event. Reweighting is the process of calculating a scaling factor which can be combined with the original event weight to give a new weight which would be correct if the event had been generated under some different set of free parameter values. This process involves no Monte Carlo techniques and so no computational time is 'wasted', it can be many orders of magnitude faster than re-generation. This significant boost in efficiency makes more involved studies of systematic uncertainty and goodness-of-fit feasible. Generating 5 \u00d7 10 5 events using the NuMI on-axis flux was found to take O (500 s), while reweighting those events to a new prediction took O (3 s) on a single CPU core, and O (0.

            "text": "NuWro now supports reweighting of free-nucleon model parameters for Charged Current Quasi Elastic (CCQE) [2] and single pion production (SPP) interactions-important interaction channels at beam energies of O (1 GeV). Three free model parameters are available for SPP events: C A 5 (0) and M A RES are free parameters in the baryonic resonance form factors [3]. The other free parameter, NR BKG is a scale factor for the cross section of SPP through non-resonant processes. Figure. 1 shows the effect of simultaneously varying M A RES and C A 5 (0) on the SPP Q 2 distribution. It can be seen that the reweighting very precisely reproduces the fully regenerated prediction. Figure. 2 shows the effect of reweighting the three parameters on the SPP cross section as a function of Q 2 and W. Increasing the value of C A 5 (0) and decreasing M A RES simultaneously results in a cross section prediction that is very similar to the nominal prediction over a large fraction of the Q 2 range; this suggests that these parameters are strongly anti-correlated.

A binned \u03c7 2 test between the generated (and reweighted) events and the released data was extremised to find the best fit parameter values. Event rate distributions, such as BNL CC1\u03c0 + Q 2 , Figure. 4, were included in a shape-only way. Cross sections, such as ANL CCQE flux-unfolded \u03c3 (E \u03bd ), Figure. 3, were also used in the fit. A consistent goodness of fit test, such as \u03c7 2 per number of degrees of freedom, is difficult to define because the bin-to-bin covariances were not provided with the data. The pre-and post-fit parameter values are presented in Table. 5. The fit converged and the best fit values of M A QE and M A RES were within the uncertainties of the nominal NuWro values. The best fit for C A 5 (0) was found to be lower than in [10], however, this fit allowed the non-resonant background contribution to vary through NR BKG and included a different subset of the available data. A similar value of C A 5 (0) was found in [11] . As part of the fit, MINUIT [12] calculates an approximate parameter error matrix, the corresponding correlation matrix is shown in Figure. 6. This preliminary tune did not include comparison to any hadronic mass distributions-where the effect of C A 5 (0) and NR BKG might be separable. Future tunes will include more data sets and further validation.",
