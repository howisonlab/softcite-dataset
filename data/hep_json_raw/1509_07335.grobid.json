Events are selected if the four anti-k t R = 0.4 jets with the largest transverse momentum (p T ) within the rapidity range |y| < 2.8 are well separated (\u2206R min 4j > 0.65), all have p T > 64 GeV, and include at least one jet with p T > 100 GeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The cross sections, corrected for detector effects, are compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order calculations as a function of the jet momenta, invariant masses, minimum and maximum opening angles and other kinematic variables.",

            "text": "The production of particle jets at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] provides a fertile testing ground for the theory describing strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In QCD, jet production is interpreted as the fragmentation of quarks and gluons produced in the scattering process followed by their subsequent hadronisation. At high transverse momenta (p T ) the scattering of partons can be calculated using perturbative QCD (pQCD) and experimental jet measurements are directly related to the scattering of quarks and gluons. The large cross sections for such processes allow for differential measurements in a wide kinematic range and stringent testing of the underlying theory.",

These events are of particular interest as the corresponding Feynman diagrams require several vertices even at leading-order (LO) in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S . The current state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for such processes are at next-to-leadingorder in \u03b1 S (next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD, NLO pQCD) [2,3], 1 and they have recently been combined with parton shower (PS) simulations [4]. An alternative approach is taken by generators which provide a matrix element (ME) for the hardest 2 \u2192 2 process while the rest of the jets are provided by a PS model, which implements a resummation of the leading-logarithmic terms (e.g. Pythia 8 [5] and Herwig++ [6]). It is also interesting to test multi-leg (i.e., 2 \u2192 n) LO pQCD generators (e.g. Sherpa [7] or MadGraph [8]), since they may provide adequate descriptions of the data in specific kinematic regions and have the advantage of being less computationally expensive than NLO calculations.",

The generators which combine 2 \u2192 2 parton matrix elements (MEs) with parton showers (PSs) are in principle not expected to provide a good description of the data, particularly in regions where the additional jets are neither soft nor collinear. A previous measurement of multi-jet cross sections at 7 TeV by the ATLAS Collaboration [9] found that the cross section predicted by MC models typically disagreed with the data by O(40%). It also found disagreements of up to 50% in the shape of the differential cross section measured as a function of p (1) T or H T . Nevertheless, there are also examples of exceptional cases where these calculations perform well, which adds interest to the measurement; for example, the same 7 TeV ATLAS paper observed that the shape of the p (4) T distribution was described by Pythia within just 10%. It is also interesting to test whether PSs based on an angular ordering perform better in angular variables such as \u2206\u03c6 min 2j or \u2206\u03c6 min 3j than those using momentum ordering. In contrast to PS predictions, multi-leg matrix element calculations matched to parton showers (ME+PS) were seen at 7 TeV to significantly improve the accuracy of the cross-section calculation and the shapes of the momentum observables. In the present analysis, such calculations are expected to perform better in events with additional high-p T jets and/or large combined invariant masses of jets. This is also the type of scenario where HEJ is expected to perform well, since it provides an all-order description of processes with more than two hard jets, and it is designed to capture the hard, wide-angle emissions which a standalone PS approach would miss. Variables such as \u2206y max 2j , \u2206y min 3j or \u03a3p central T were included in the analysis with this purpose in mind. Finally, the fixed-order, four-jet NLO predictions are expected to provide a better estimation of the cross sections than the LO calculations. Interestingly, studies at 7 TeV found that the NLO cross section for four-jet events was \u223c 30% higher than the data [10].",

The additional PDF sets include variations in the value of \u03b1 S . The sum in quadrature of the resulting scale and PDF variations defines the NLO theoretical uncertainty included in the result figures in section 9. The uncertainty is dominated by the scale component due to the rapid drop of the cross section with decreasing values of the renormalisation and factorisation scales. As a result, the uncertainty is significantly asymmetric.",

Herwig++ gives good descriptions of the \u03c6 variables, but fails at describing the rapidity variables. Pythia has some problems describing both three-jet variables, as well as \u2206y max 2j .

HEJ has been designed to describe events with two jets significantly separated in rapidity with additional, central, high-p T radiation. These variables are also useful to describe the spatial configuration of the events, as they represent the forwardbackward rapidity span of the jets, and whether the leading jet is among the two central ones or not. The NLO predictions and MadGraph+Pythia are also expected to be successful in this regime, whereas the 2 \u2192 2 generators with PSs are expected to be less suitable.",

The cross sections are studied as a function of a variety of kinematic and topological variables which include momenta, masses and angles. Events are selected if the four anti-k t R = 0.4 jets with the largest transverse momentum within the rapidity range |y| < 2.8 are well separated (\u2206R min 4j > 0.65), all have p T > 64 GeV, and include at least one jet with p T > 100 GeV. The results are obtained from the analysis of the full dataset collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012, which corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The total experimental systematic uncertainty is typically of the order of 10%, and it is dominated by the jet energy scale calibration uncertainty.",

Three leading-order calculations are also considered, including two 2 \u2192 2 PS samples (Pythia and Herwig++) and a multi-leg calculation with up to four partons in the ME matched to a PS generated by Pythia (MadGraph+Pythia). The LO cross sections and HEJ are normalised by fixed factors to facilitate the comparison of the spectra in the kinematic regions of interest; these factors vary between 0.6 and 1.4 for the different samples, where the MadGraph+Pythia and HEJ samples are the ones that need the smallest corrections. The NLO predictions, BlackHat/Sherpa and NJet/Sherpa, are almost always compatible with the data within their theoretical uncertainties, which are found to be large (O(30%) at low momenta) and asymmetric. Within the normalisation scheme used, MadGraph+Pythia also provides a good description of the data, as does HEJ, especially at high leading jet p T . The 2 \u2192 2 PS calculations generally describe the data relatively poorly, although they are found to provide good predictions in some particular cases: Pythia gives a very good prediction of p",

For variables that are particularly sensitive to wide-angle configurations and high-p T radiation, such as masses or angles, BlackHat/Sherpa, NJet/Sherpa and MadGraph+Pythia do a remarkable job overall. HEJ also provides a good description of the data, the main exception being that it disagrees with the rapidity measurements in events with low p (1) T . At high p (1) T the prediction is very good.
