Higher-order penguin amplitudes, which are difficult to calculate in QCD, also contribute ( Fig. 1). Ref. [3] suggests that the size of contributions from these processes can be determined by studying decay modes such as B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * (892) 0 where they dominate. The B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * (892) 0 decay mode was first observed by the CDF Collaboration [4] and subsequently studied in detail by the LHCb Collaboration [5].",

To ensure good separation between the B 0 and B 0 s signals, the uncertainty on the reconstructed mass returned by the fit must be less than 11 MeV/c 2 . Combinatorial background from particles produced in the primary vertex is further reduced by requiring the decay time of the B 0 (s) meson to exceed 0.3 ps. Four criteria are applied to reduce background from specific b-hadron decay modes. First, the candidate is rejected if the invariant mass of the hadron pair calculated assuming that both particles are kaons is within 10 MeV/c 2 of the known \u03c6 meson mass [26], suppressing B 0 s \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c6 decays where one of the kaons is misidentified as a pion.

This rejects 80 % of the background from this source whilst retaining 90 % of B 0 (s) signal candidates. Third, to suppress background from \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)p\u03c0 \u2212 decays where the proton is misidentifed as a kaon, candidates with P p > 0.3 and an invariant mass within 15 MeV/c 2 of the known \u039b 0 b mass [26] are discarded.
