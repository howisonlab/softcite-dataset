BESIII has searched for continuous two photon transitions using \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 l + l \u2212 events, where l is e or \u00b5. Selection requirements are used to reduce backgrounds from \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , \u03c7 cJ \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and \u03b7J/\u03c8. The invariant mass distributions of the two leptons for selected events are shown in Fig. 2. A clear excess is seen at the J/\u03c8 peak over \u03c8 \u2032 background from Monte Carlo simulation plus continuum background. Branching fractions of B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8) of (1.06 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10 \u22123 and (0.99 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10 \u22123 are determined for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 ee and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 cases, respectively. Combining, we determine B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3J/\u03c8) = (1.02 \u00b1 0.05 +0.19 \u22120.20 ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . This is a first measurement. The result is preliminary, and more details can be found in Ref. The f 0 (980) and a 0 (980) are controversial particles. They have been described as qq or qqqq states, KK molecules, or qqG hybrid states. Mixing was first suggested by Achasov, [16] and mixing measurements may be important to clarify the nature of these particles. There have been suggestions [17] for BESIII to search for mixing signals in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 0 \u2192 \u03c6a 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c0 0 , where the f 0 mixes to a 0 , and in the process [18] \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 a 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , where a 0 mixes to f 0 . The signal for the former case is shown in Fig. 3 a). The expected mixing signal is very narrow (8 MeV/ 2 ) between the K + K \u2212 and K 0 S K 0 S thresholds (987 -995 MeV/ 2 ). Backgrounds are sideband and a wide a 0 from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 * /K * K \u2192 \u03c6a 0 . Fitting to signal plus backgrounds determines 24.7 \u00b1 8.6 mixing events or < 36.7 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.). This gives a mixing intensity \u03be f a = (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.2)% or < 1.1% at the 90% C.L. For the latter mixing case, we determine \u03be af = (0.32 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.12)% or < 0.91% at the 90% C.L. Figure 3 b) shows our results and upper limits compared to models (qq, q 2q2 , KK, and qqg) and calculated values (SND, KLOE, BNL, and CB) based on f 0 and a 0 parameters. References for models and calculations may be found in Refs. [17] and [18]. Ours are the first direct measurements. BESII observed a pp threshold enhancement in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp. [19] Fitted to a S-wave resonance, it gives a mass below pp threshold of M (pp) = 1859 +3+5 \u221210\u221225 MeV/c 2 . BESIII has confirmed this observation [20] in \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp with a fitted mass of M (pp) = 1861 +6+7 \u221213\u221226 MeV/c 2 and directly in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp with a fitted mass of M (pp) = 1859\u00b10.8 (preliminary and statistical error only), shown in Fig. 4 a). CLEOc also observes a pp threshold enhancement in \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp and obtains a consistent fitted mass. [21] BESII also observed a resonance at M (\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 1833.7\u00b16.1\u00b12.7 MeV/c 2 in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 where \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 and \u03b3\u03c1. [22] BESIII also confirms this observation with a mass of M (\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 1842.4\u00b12.8 (preliminary and statistical error only), as shown in Fig. 4 b). Many results, many preliminary, have been presented based on BESIII samples of 106 M \u03c8 \u2032 and about 226 J/\u03c8 events. Many more results are to be expected in the future. In addition, BESIII acquired nearly 1f b \u22121 of data at the \u03c8(3770) resonance this year, including approximately 75pb \u22121 of scan data around the \u03c8(3770) peak. Decays of the \u03c8(3770) produce quantum correlated DD pairs, which are ideal for mixing and CP violation studies, as well measurements of absolute branching fractions and studies of semi-leptonic decays. This sample allows BESIII to begin their charm physics program.",
