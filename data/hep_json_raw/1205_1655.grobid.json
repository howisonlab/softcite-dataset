The observed suppression of high\u2212p T particle production (R AA ) and away-side jets (I AA ) is generally attributed to energy loss of partons as they propagate through the plasma. We present the results obtained from the analysis of Pb\u2212Pb collisions at \u221a s N N = 2.76 TeV recorded by ALICE in November 2010. The nuclear modification factors R AA and I AA , and the status of full jet reconstruction in Pb\u2212Pb is presented. Comparison with the RHIC measurements at lower collision energy and with theory models is shown.",

At p T = 6-7 GeV/c R AA is smaller than at RHIC indicating that a very dense medium is formed in Pb\u2212Pb collisions at the LHC. The R AA measured as a function of charged particle density dN ch /d\u03b7 (from [14]) in four p T intervals is shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). The strongest R AA dependence as a function of dN ch /d\u03b7 is observed for low\u2212p T particles (4 < p T < 7 GeV/c), and becomes weaker with larger p T . There is also shown the PHENIX R AA measurement in the lowest p T interval. It is comparable with R AA measured by ALICE for dN ch /d\u03b7 > 400. For smaller dN ch /d\u03b7, PHENIX and ALICE measurements differ what might be related to the collision geometry and have to be further studied.",

The measurement of heavy-favor production at high-p T provides unique observables of jet quenching. The suggestion that massive quarks experience reduced energy loss due to the suppression of forward radiation (\"dead cone effect\") has not been borne out by RHIC measurements. The first results from the LHC indicate (Fig. 3, right panel) that the suppression of D mesons might be smaller than for pions at p T < 5 GeV/c (more analysis details can be found in [20]).

Here, the background density \u03c1 is calculated on an event-by-event basis as the median for the p T /A ratio of reconstructed k T \u2212clusters in |\u03b7| < 0.5 by using k T algorithm [23]. The resulting raw jet spectra are shown in Fig. 5 for two different track p T cut-off values. The difference in the shape of the p T distributions in central collisions, clearly visible for the small track p T cut-off, is due to the background fluctuations which dominate over a wide p T range. The analysis of the jet background sources in Pb-Pb collisions is ongoing (more details in [24]).",

The suppression observed in central Pb\u2212Pb collisions at the LHC is stronger than in central Au\u2212Au collisions at RHIC. The comparison of ALICE data to model calculations indicates a large sensitivity of high-p T particle production to details of energy loss mechanisms.",
