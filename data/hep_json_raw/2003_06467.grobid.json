The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The measurements are performed in a fiducial phase space and extrapolated to the full phase space, separately for the dilepton and lepton+jets channels, where lepton corresponds to either an electron or a muon. The results of the measurements in the fiducial phase space for the dilepton and lepton+jets channels, respectively, are \u03c3 ttjj = 2.36\u00b10.02 (stat)\u00b10.20 (syst) pb and 31.0\u00b10.2 (stat)\u00b12.9 (syst) pb, and for the cross section ratio 0.017 \u00b1 0.001 (stat) \u00b1 0.001 (syst) and 0.020 \u00b1 0.001 (stat) \u00b1 0.001 (syst). The values of \u03c3 ttbb are determined from the product of the \u03c3 ttjj and the cross section ratio, obtaining, respectively, 0.040\u00b10.002 (stat)\u00b10.005 (syst) pb and 0.62\u00b10.03 (stat)\u00b10.07 (syst) pb. These measurements are the most precise to date and are consistent, within the uncertainties, with the standard model expectations obtained using a matrix element calculation at nextto-leading order in quantum chromodynamics matched to a parton shower.",

Even though calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are available for both processes [1][2][3], they suffer from large uncertainties in the choice of factorization and renormalization scales [4], because of the presence of two very different scales, the top quark mass (m t ) and the jet transverse momentum (p T ), that both play a role in these processes. The experimental measurements of the proton-proton (pp) production cross sections for pp \u2192 ttjj (\u03c3 tt jj ) and pp \u2192 ttbb (\u03c3 tt bb ) provide a useful test of NLO QCD calculations.",

The top quark Yukawa coupling can be probed directly in the associated production of the Higgs boson with tt (ttH). This process was recently observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [10,11].

The ATLAS collaboration measures at 13 TeV the production of tt pairs as a function of the b jet multiplicity in the dilepton (lepton+jets) channel with an uncertainty of 13 (17)%. These measurements are compatible with theoretical predictions within the uncertainties. The CMS measurement at 13 TeV in the dilepton channel reports a value for this ratio that is 1.8 times larger than the NLO SM prediction. However, the total uncertainty in this measurement is 32% and the statistical significance of this deviation is therefore only around two standard deviations.

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons is generally better in the barrel region than in the endcaps, and depends on the bremsstrahlung energy emitted by the electron as it traverses the material in front of the ECAL [20]. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. The efficiency to reconstruct and identify muons is greater than 96%. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution, for muons with p T up to 100 GeV, of 1% in the barrel and 3% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 7% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [21].",

In this process, the identification of the particle type (photon, electron, muon, charged or neutral hadron) plays an important role in the determination of the particle direction and energy. For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from the reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear-safe anti-k T algorithm [23,24] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is computed as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all the PF candidates in an event, and its magnitude is denoted as p miss T [25]. The p miss T is modified to account for corrections to the energy scale of the reconstructed jets in the event. The candidate vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the jets and the associated p miss T . Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [26]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than -3 -JHEP07(2020)125 4 \u00b5s.

The tt signal sample is generated by powheg (v2) [27][28][29][30] at NLO and combined with the parton shower (PS) and underlying event (UE) simulation from pythia8 (v8.219) [31] using the CUETP8M2T4 [32] tune. A second powheg sample employs herwig++ [33] (v2.7.1) using the tune EE5C [34]. In these samples additional (b) jets beyond real emission at NLO are generated by the parton shower. The proton structure is described by the parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 [35]. To compare with an alternative theoretical prediction, MadGraph5 amc@nlo (v2.2.2) (MG amc@nlo) is used to generate tt events in the five-flavor scheme (5FS) [36,37]. The madspin [38] package is used to incorporate the correct treatment of the decay particles preserving spin correlation effects. In addition to the tt pair, up to two additional partons are simulated at NLO and matched using the FXFX algorithm [39], and the PS simulation is performed by pythia8, denoted as MG amc@nlo + pythia8 5FS [FXFX]. Detailed explanations of the different parameters in the tt simulations can be found in [32]. The tt simulations are normalized to their inclusive cross section, 832 +20 \u221229 (scale)\u00b135 (PDF and strong coupling \u03b1 S ) pb, calculated with the top++ v2.0 program [40] to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, including soft-gluon resummation at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order [41][42][43][44][45][46].",

The particle-level jets are obtained by clustering final-state particles with a mean lifetime greater than 30 ps (except neutrinos) using the anti-k T algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4. The flavor of the particle-level jet is identified by the ghost-matching technique [56]. The ghost-matched clusters are formed with final-state particles supplemented by hadrons containing bottom and charm quarks (called bottom and charm hadrons) that do not have further bottom or charm hadrons as daughter particles. The momentum of each bottom and charm hadron is artificially reduced to zero in order to avoid affecting the observable particle-level jet momentum. If a particle-level jet contains bottom or charm hadrons, it is assigned to the corresponding flavor and called a b or c jet. Otherwise, it is considered as a particle-level light-flavor jet (from a gluon, or u, d, or s quark). Particle-level jets are identified as products of the tt decay if the bottom hadron used for the flavor assignment belongs to the simulation history of any of the top quarks.",

Jet energy corrections are also applied as functions of the jet p T and \u03b7 [57]. The b jets are identified using the combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) b tagging algorithm [58]. Two different operating points for the CSVv2 algorithm are chosen, based on the expected background composition of each decay channel. The operating point selected for the dilepton (lepton+jets) channel corresponds to an efficiency for correctly identifying b jets of about 70 (50)% and a probability of about 1 (0.1)% to misidentify a light-flavor jet as a b jet [58]. A tighter operating point in the lepton+jets channel is chosen to increase the rejection of background processes with multijet final states. Since the MC simulation does not reproduce exactly the b tagging discriminant distribution observed in data, scale factors are applied to the simulated events in order to correct its shape. The scale factors, derived using a tag-and-probe technique in enriched regions for both b and light-flavor jets, are applied as a function of the jet b tagging discriminant, p T , and \u03b7 [58].",

Therefore, the jets with the thirdand fourth-largest b tagging discriminant values are considered as additional jets. The identification of the origin of the jets in the lepton+jets channel is more complex because the relatively large number of jets (at least six) leads to ambiguities in the jet assignment. Therefore, a jet assignment based only on the b tagging discriminant is insufficient and a kinematic fit [60] is applied. The event inputs for the kinematic fit algorithm are the four-momenta of the selected lepton and jets, whether a jet is identified as a b jet, and p miss T . The kinematic fit algorithm constrains the momentum of the aforementioned objects to the hypothesis that two top quarks of the same mass are produced, each one decaying to a bottom quark and a W boson. The W boson decay products are also constrained to an invariant mass of 80.4 GeV [59]. The last constraint in the kinematic fit requires that the jets associated with b quarks from top quark decays must be identified as b jets as well. The algorithm assigns a \u03c7 2 value [61] to each solution according to the goodness of the fit of each jet permutation. The solution selected is the one with the lowest \u03c7 2 value. This guarantees that the selected jet permutation is the most compatible with the tt process. All jets that are not included in the selected solution (i.e., not coming from the top quark or W boson decay) are considered as additional jets for the lepton+jets channel.

The PDF uncertainty is estimated using JHEP07(2020)125 the 100 individual uncertainties and \u03b1 S in the NNPDF3.0 set [63], following the prescription of PDF4LHC [64]. The nominal CR model uses a scheme based on multiple parton interactions with early resonance decays (ERD) turned off. The uncertainty from CR is estimated by employing three alternative schemes: with the ERD switched on, a QCDinspired procedure [65], and a gluon-move scheme [66]. The uncertainty in the tt branching fraction is not included in the extrapolation to the FPS since its effect is negligible.",
