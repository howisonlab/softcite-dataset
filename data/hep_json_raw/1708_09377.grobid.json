In 1990, DM2 Collaboration at Orsay reported the first measurement of the production of \u039b 0 and \u03a3 0 and their timelike form factors [3], and in 2007 the BaBar Collaboration at SLAC reported [4] measurement of elastic form factors of \u039b 0 , \u03a3 0 and \u039b 0 \u03a3 0 transition form factors using the ISR technique. Both the DM2 and BaBar measurements were made near threshold energies, and very few counts were observed. Small statistics and small momentum transfer (generally < 5 GeV 2 ) did not lend these measurements to interpretation in terms of pQCD.",

It was subsequently noted that pQCD predicts that, unlike at \u03c8(2S), resonance production of hadron pairs at \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4170) was expected to be very small, and non-resonance electromagnetic production of hadron pairs would dominate, and it could be used to determine electromagnetic form factors for large timelike momen-tum transfers.

Using the measured branching fractions for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) [9], and the present luminosities and efficiencies, we determine that the expected number of events is 3.0 \u039b 0 , 1.4 \u03a3 + , 1.2 \u03a3 0 , 1.2 \u039e \u2212 , 0.6 \u039e 0 , and 0.3 \u2126 \u2212 for resonance decays of the \u03c8(3770) in the present measurements, and 2.0 \u039b 0 , 1.0 \u03a3 + , 0.9 \u03a3 0 , 0.9 \u039e \u2212 , 0.4 \u039e 0 , and 0.2 \u2126 \u2212 for resonance decays of the \u03c8(4170). In other words, the contributions of resonance decays are negligibly small in all cases, and the observed events at \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4170) can be safely attributed to electromagnetic production, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 * \u2192 BB, and can be used to determine form factors.",

Other systematic uncertainties are 2% in N (\u03c8(2S)), 1% in e + e \u2212 luminosity, and 0.2% in the radiative corrections.

Wilezek calls the spin scalar (isospin 0) diquark in \u039b 0 the 'good' diquark, and the spin vector (isopsin 1) diquark in \u03a3 0 the 'bad' diquark. One consequence of this is that in production experiments, one expects that \"the good diquark would be significantly more likely to be produced than the bad diquark\", and that \"this would reflect itself in a large \u039b/\u03a3 ratio\" [19]. Wilczek cites the LEP [9] observation of the relative multiplicities in the decay of \u039b 0 and \u03a3 0 , (\u03c3(\u039b 0 )/\u03c3(\u03a3 0 ) = 3.5 \u00b1 1.7) as an important confirmation of the prediction. The decay of \u039b 0 and \u03a3 0 in our measurements provides independent confirmation of this prediction. As listed in Tables II, and III, we obtain \u03c3(\u039b 0 )/\u03c3(\u03a3 0 ) = 2.46 \u00b1 0.46 at \u03c8(3770), |Q 2 | = 14.2 GeV 2 , and \u03c3(\u039b 0 )/\u03c3(\u03a3 0 ) = 2.56 \u00b1 1.40 at \u03c8(4170), |Q 2 | = 17.4 GeV 2 . We consider these measurements as strong independent confirmation of the importance of diquark correlations in the structure of \u039b 0 and \u03a3 0 . Our data for the \u039e 0 and \u039e \u2212 containing two strange quarks should provide additional opportunity to examine other features of diquark correlations.",
