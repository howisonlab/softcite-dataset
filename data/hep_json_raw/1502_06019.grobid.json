The search is based on data collected with the BABAR detector at the \u03a5 (2S) resonance. A sample of \u03a5 (1S) mesons is selected via the decay \u03a5 (2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5 (1S). The A 0 \u2192 cc decay is identified through the reconstruction of hadronic D 0 , D + , and D * (2010) + meson decays. No significant signal is observed. The measured 90% confidence-level upper limits on the product branching fraction B(\u03a5 (1S) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 ) \u00d7 B(A 0 \u2192 cc) range from 7.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for A 0 masses from 4.00 to 8.95 GeV/c 2 and 9.10 to 9.25 GeV/c 2 , where the region between 8.95 and 9.10 GeV/c 2 is excluded because of background from \u03a5 (2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ (1P ), \u03c7 bJ (1P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5 (1S) decays.",

It solves the \u00b5-problem of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the hierarchy problem of the SM [1,2]. The NMSSM has a rich Higgs sector of two charged, three neutral CP -even, and two neutral CP -odd bosons. Although the Higgs boson discovered at the CERN LHC [3,4] is consistent with the SM Higgs boson, it can also be interpreted as one of the heavier Higgs bosons of the NMSSM [5]. The least heavy of the NMSSM Higgs bosons, denoted A 0 , could be light enough to be produced in the decay of an \u03a5 meson [1,6].",

Below the charm mass threshold, the A 0 preferentially decays into two gluons if tan \u03b2 is of order 1, and to ss or to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 if tan \u03b2 is of order 10. Above the charm mass threshold, the A 0 decays mainly to cc for tan \u03b2 of order 1 and to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 for tan \u03b2 of order 10. BABAR has already ruled out much of the NMSSM parameter space for A 0 masses below the charm mass threshold through searches * Now at: University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Perugia, Dipartimento di Fisica, I-06123 Perugia, Italy \u2021 Now at: Laboratoire de Physique Nucl\u00e9aire et de Hautes Energies, IN2P3/CNRS, F-75252 Paris, France \u00a7 Now at: University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK \u00b6 Deceased * * Now at: University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA \u2020 \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy for A 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [8,9] and for A 0 \u2192 gg or ss [10]. Above the charm mass threshold, BABAR has ruled out some of the parameter space for high tan \u03b2 with the A 0 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 searches [11,12]. None of the searches from BABAR have observed a significant signal, nor have the searches in leptonic channels from the CMS and CLEO [13][14][15] Collaborations. The A 0 \u2192 cc channel is one of the last channels that has not yet been explored. We report a search for the decay \u03a5 (1S) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 , A 0 \u2192 cc with A 0 masses ranging between 4.00 and 9.25 GeV/c 2 . An \u03a5 (1S) decay is tagged by the presence of a pion pair from \u03a5 (2S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5 (1S). An A 0 \u2192 cc decay is tagged by the presence of at least one charmed meson such as a D 0 , a D + , or a D * (2010) + . Therefore candidates are constructed from the combination of a photon, a D meson, and a dipion candidate. An exclusive reconstruction of the A 0 is not attempted. Instead, a search is performed in the spectrum of the invariant mass of the system that recoils against the dipion-photon system. The analysis is therefore sensitive to the production of any charm resonance produced in the radiative decays of the \u03a5 (1S) meson.",

            "text": "The fits are performed to the m X spectrum, for various choices of m A 0 , in steps of 10 and 2 MeV/c 2 for the low-and high-mass regions, respectively. The step sizes are at least 3 times smaller than the width of the signal m X PDF. We use a local fitting range of \u00b110 \u03c3 CB around m A 0 , where \u03c3 CB denotes the width of the Gaussian component of the Crystal Ball function. The \u03c3 CB parameter varies between 120 and 8 MeV/c 2 for values of m A 0 between 4.00 and 9.25 GeV/c 2 , as shown in Fig. 3. We do not perform a fit for 8.95 < m A 0 < 9.10 GeV/c 2 because of a large background from \u03a5 (2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ (1P ), \u03c7 bJ (1P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5 (1S) decays. The fitting procedure is validated using backgroundonly pseudo-experiments. The m X PDF used to generate pseudo-experiments for the low-mass region is obtained from a fit of a fifth-order polynomial to the low-mass region data. The m X PDF used for the high-mass region is obtained from a fit of the sum of four exponential functions plus six Crystal Ball functions to the high-mass region data, with shape parameters fixed according to expectations from simulation and with the relative normalizations determined in the fit. The Crystal Ball functions describe the \u03a5 (2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 bJ (1P ) and \u03c7 bJ (1P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5 (1S) transitions while the exponential terms describe the nonresonant background. Four exponential terms are used because the non-resonant background increases rapidly for higher m X . The background fits are overlaid in Fig. 2. The fitting procedure returns a null signal for most m A 0 values but is found to require a correction to N sig for values of m A 0 near 4.00 or 9.25 GeV/c 2 . The corrections are determined from the average number of signal events found in the fits to the background-only pseudoexperiments. The corrections are applied as a function of m A 0 and reach a maximum of 15 and 50 candidates in the low-and high-mass regions, respectively. The uncertainty of the correction is assumed to be half its value. The reconstruction efficiency takes into account the hadronization of the cc system into D mesons, the branching fraction of D mesons to the five decay channels, detector acceptance, and the BDT selection. The efficiencies range from 4.0% to 2.6% for simulated A 0 masses between 4.00 and 9.25 GeV/c 2 .",

The corresponding result for the high-mass region is 2.0 standard deviations at 8.411 GeV/c 2 . The fits are shown in Fig. 5. Such fluctuations occur in 54% and 80% of pseudo-experiments, respectively. Hence our data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. Upper limits on the product branching fraction B(\u03a5 (1S) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 ) \u00d7 B(A 0 \u2192 cc) at 90% confidence level (C.L.) are determined assuming a uniform prior, with the constraint that the product branching fraction be greater than zero. The distribution of the likelihood function for N sig is assumed to be Gaussian with a width equal to the total uncertainty in N sig . The upper limits obtained from the low-mass region are combined with those from the high-mass region to define a continuous spectrum for the upper limits. The results are shown in Fig. 6. In summary, we search for a resonance in radiative decays of the \u03a5 (1S) with a charm tag.
