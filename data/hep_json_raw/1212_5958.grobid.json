One-dimensional K ch K ch correlation functions are constructed in three multiplicity and four transverse momentum ranges. The K ch K ch femtoscopic source parameters R and are extracted. The K ch K ch correlations show a slight increase of femtoscopic radii with increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease of radii with increasing transverse momentum. These trends are similar to the ones observed for and K 0 s K 0 s correlations in pp and heavyion collisions. However at high multiplicities, there is an indication that the one-dimensional correlation radii for charged kaons are larger than those for pions in contrast to what was observed in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.",

Studying the QGP is the main goal of the ALICE experiment (a large ion collider experiment) [2]. The system created in ultrarelativistic pp collisions at LHC energies might be similar to the system created in noncentral heavy-ion collisions because of the large energy deposited in the overlapping region and therefore may also manifest a collective behavior. The highly compressed, strongly interacting system is expected to undergo longitudinal and transverse expansions. Experimentally, the expansion and the spatial extent at decoupling are observable via Bose-Einstein correlations.",

Goldhaber, W. Lee, and A. Pais 50 years ago [3]. The correlation method since developed and known at present as ''correlation femtoscopy'' was successfully applied to the measurement of the space-time characteristics of particle production processes in high-energy collisions, especially in heavy-ion collisions (see, e.g. [4][5][6]). Bose-Einstein correlations of identical particles were widely studied in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) [7] and were found to confirm the hydrodynamic type of collective expansion of the fireball created in such collisions. In heavy-ion collisions the decrease of the correlation radii with increasing particle momentum was usually considered as a manifestation of a collective behavior of the matter created in such collisions [6]. Event multiplicities reached in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC are comparable to those measured in peripheral A \u00fe A collisions at RHIC, making the study of the particle momentum dependence of the correlation radii an important test of the collectivity in pp collisions.",

Kaons were selected by requiring that the deviation of the specific (dE=dx) energy loss in the TPC from that calculated with a parametrized Bethe-Bloch formula be within some number of sigma standard deviations (N TPC ). A similar N TOF method was applied for the particle identification in the TOF using the difference between the measured time of flight and the calculated one as a function of the track length and the particle momentum at each tracking step and for each particle mass. More details on the particle identification are given in Ref. [17], where it is shown in particular that the fraction efficiency of the particles reconstructed by the TPC with associated signal in the TOF (the TOF matching efficiency) deviates from 30% up to 55% in the p T region (under study in our paper). In the present analysis, strict cuts on TPC and TOF signals for kaon selection were used in order to provide the better purity of the kaon sample. The relative contribution of the kaons from the sample with TOF signal to the full sample of the identified kaons used in this analysis is about 60%.",

Figure 1 shows the transverse momentum dependence of the kaon purity (the ratio of correctly identified kaons to all identified ones) obtained with Monte Carlo (PYTHIA) simulations. The contamination comes mainly from e \u00fe =e \u00c0 with maximum $25% for 0:35 < p T < 0:6 GeV=c and also from pions at the level $1-3% for 0:35 < p T < 1:2 GeV=c. In consequence, the probability of selecting an ee or a pair instead of a KK pair, even in the case where the contamination is maximal, is still rather low, smaller than $6%. The probability of selecting an eK(Ke) pair instead of a KK pair can reach $37% for 0:35 < p T < 0:6 GeV=c. The probability of selecting a K\u00f0K\u00de pair instead of a KK pair is less then $6% for 0:35 < p T < 1:2 GeV=c. Note that such contamination modifies only the strength of correlation and not the shape of the correlation function.

As one can see, the Monte Carlo simulation reproduces well the experimental correlation function at large q inv , i.e. the long-range correlations. The model does not contain the Bose-Einstein effect, so the enhancement at low q inv is due to nonfemtoscopic correlations in PYTHIA, probably arising from minijets. The baseline points, obtained from PERUGIA-2011, were fitted to Eq. (2). The parameters a and b were used in the fitting of the experimental points by Eq. 1. The same method was used to model the baseline for the ALICE correlation studies in 0.9 [8] and 7 TeV [9] pp collisions. Figures 3 and 4 and Table I present   parameters and Gaussian radii versus",

As seen in Fig. 3, the parameters for K ch K ch are generally smaller than those for K 0 s K 0 s [10]. There are several reason for the parameter to be less than the ideal case of unity. Possible causes may be a partially coherent source, a contribution to the observed kaons from decays of longlived resonances, a deviation from the Gaussian parametrization due to a mixture of sources with different radii (see e.g. [21]), or a particle misidentification. The latter cause influences mostly the K ch K ch sample in the momentum range 0:4 < p T < 0:6 GeV=c (Fig. 1). For the future, it seems desirable to improve the PID and thus increase the purity and improve the description of nonfemtoscopic correlations using different models.",

These radii also decrease with increasing m T for the large multiplicity bins N ch (12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22) and N ch \u00f0>22\u00de. Such a tendency was found for pions [9] and neutral kaons K 0 s K 0 s [10] in pp collisions and pions in heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies [22]. In the low multiplicity bin N ch (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11) charged kaons show a completely different k T dependence of the radii: these radii increase with k T . This effect is qualitatively similar to that of pions [9]. It was observed that parameters ( Fig. 3) are correlated with the radii (Fig. 4). Such a correlation can result from . One-dimensional charged kaon radii versus m T extracted by fitting correlation functions shown in Fig. 2 to Eq. (1) and the baseline to Eq. (2). For comparison, the [9] and K 0 s K 0 s [10] radii measured by ALICE in 7 TeV pp collisions are also shown. Statistical (darker lines) and total errors are shown. The points corresponding to the second and third multiplicity bins are offset by 0:03 GeV=c 2 for clarity.  The reasons for such a dependence are (1) nonideal description of the baseline by PERUGIA-2011, especially at large k T , (2) non-Gaussian shape of the source due to resonance contribution, and (3) nonspherical shape of the source. The last two points mean that our one-dimensional Gaussian fit is only an approximate description of the source. In pp collisions, the effect of this non-Gaussian shape of the correlation function due to different sizes in the x-y-z directions plays a more important role than in heavy-ion collisions. This requires a detailed threedimensional analysis, which is foreseen for K ch K ch correlation functions with the new large set of data recorded by the ALICE Collaboration in 2011 and 2012. The m T dependence of the radii in heavy-ion collisions was interpreted as the manifestation of the strong collective hydrodynamic expansion of the created matter [6]. The observed similar behavior in pp collisions, shown in Fig. 4, has the following specific features: (1) at low multiplicity the radii increase with k T and (2) there is no distinct m T scaling; the kaon radii seem to be larger than the pion ones. The model calculations performed in [11] can successfully describe the different behavior of pion correlation radii in low and high multiplicity bins, suggesting that the contribution of the hydrodynamic phase is negligible in low-multiplicity events, while for events with high multiplicity, it is substantial.",

According to simple chemical model calculations [10], the influence of this flow should be relatively smaller for kaons than for pions, leading to the effect that the kaon radii can be larger than the pion ones. The measured K ch K ch correlation radii displayed in Fig. 4 support such an hypothesis; however, a detailed theoretical study is needed.",

In agreement with the previous measurements in pp and heavy-ion collisions at lower energies, the extracted correlation radii R inv increase with the event multiplicity and decrease with the pair transverse mass/momentum. The novel features are some hints to the increase of the radii with m T in the low-multiplicity bin and to the fact that kaon radii are larger than pion ones. These peculiarities deserve further experimental and theoretical studies.",

The model does not contain the Bose-Einstein effect, so the enhancement at low q inv is due to nonfemtoscopic correlations in PYTHIA, probably arising from minijets. The baseline points, obtained from PERUGIA-2011, were fitted to Eq. (2). The parameters a and b were used in the fitting of the experimental points by Eq.(1).
