Therefore high intensity kaon experiments provide opportunities for precision studies of \u03c0 0 decay physics.

In a rather general set of models, the interaction of the DP with the visible sector is through kinetic mixing with the Standard Model hypercharge U (1)  [2]. In these models, the new coupling constant \u03b5 is proportional to the electric charge and the DP couples in exactly the same way to quarks and leptons. These scenarios provide an explanation to the observed rise in the cosmic-ray positron fraction with energy, and offer an explanation to the muon gyromagnetic ratio (g\u22122) problem [3].",
