The jets were required to have transverse momentum p jet T > 40 GeV and pseudorapidity 1.5 < |\u03b7 jet | < 4.7, and to have values of \u03b7 jet with opposite signs. The data used for this study were collected with the CMS detector during low-luminosity running at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 8 pb \u22121 . Events with no charged particles with p T > 0.2 GeV in the interval \u22121 < \u03b7 < 1 between the jets are observed in excess of calculations that assume no color-singlet exchange. The fraction of events with such a rapidity gap, amounting to 0.5-1% of the selected dijet sample, is measured as a function of the p T of the second-leading jet and of the rapidity separation between the jets. The data are compared to previous measurements at the Tevatron, and to perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations based on the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution equations, including different models of the nonperturbative gap survival probability.",

            "text": "The events considered in this study are pp collisions where two jets are produced with a large rapidity gap between them. The absence of particles between the jets is reminiscent of a diffractive process [20], in which a color-singlet exchange (CSE) takes place between the interacting partons. In diffractive processes, such an exchange is described in terms of the pomeron, a combination of gluons in a color-singlet state. However, the absolute value of the four-momentum squared exchanged in standard diffractive events (less than a few GeV 2 ) is much smaller than that in the events considered here. Such events can be understood in a BFKL-inspired approach in terms of the exchange of a color-singlet gluon ladder ( Fig. 1), as first discussed by Mueller and Tang in Ref. [21] and further developed in Refs. [22][23][24]. Jet-gapjet events in proton-proton collisions may be affected by additional scatterings among the spectator partons, which can destroy the original rapidity gap. Such a contribution is typically described by a non-perturbative quantity, the socalled gap survival probability, which quantifies the fraction of events where the rapidity gap is not destroyed by interactions between spectator partons [19].",

The key feature of the anti-k T algorithm is the resilience of the jet boundary with respect to soft radiation. This leads to cone-shaped hard jets. Soft jets tend to have more complicated shapes. The jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found in the simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true hadron-level momentum over the whole p jet T spectrum and detector acceptance. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution for jets with p jet T = 40 GeV (200 GeV) is about 12% (7%) for |\u03b7 jet | < 0.5 and about 10% for 4 < |\u03b7 jet | < 4.5 [39]. Jet energy corrections are derived from the simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events [40]. No jet energy corrections related to the removal of pileup contributions [41] are required for the jets studied in this analysis.",

The events were simulated using the Z2* tune [44], which was developed to reproduce the CMS underlying event data at center-of-mass energies up to 7 TeV. pythia 6 models the production of diffractive dijets (leading to a final state with a gap-jet-jet topology) and of central diffractive and exclusive dijets (leading to a gap-jet-jet-gap final-state).

The hadronization process in herwig is based on cluster fragmentation: at the end of the perturbative parton evolution, clusters are built and then decayed into the final-state hadrons. The herwig 6 generator does not include any modeling of MPI; they are instead simulated with the jimmy package [46]. For simplicity, unless stated otherwise, by herwig 6 we herafter refer to the combination of this MC generator with jimmy. The herwig 6 generator predicts a decrease of the CSE fraction with increasing p T of the jets, but the Tevatron data show instead the opposite trend [25,28].

This difference is reflected in the N tracks distributions: whereas the shapes of the distributions are similar for the SS and OS samples, the mean N tracks value in the SS sample is slightly lower. In order to minimize the difference between the average N tracks values of the two samples, the gap region for the SS sample is enlarged to |\u03b7| < 1.2, in agreement with the range reported by the CDF Collaboration [30].

The pythia 6 and herwig 6 samples are normal-ized to the number of events measured for N tracks > 3 and N tracks = 0, respectively. Beneath each plot the ratio of the data yield to the sum of the normalized herwig 6 and pythia 6 predictions is shown. The vertical error bars indicate the statistical uncertainties \u221a s = 546 GeV. Later, it was observed that the NBD fit reproduces less well the tails of the particle multiplicity at higher center-of-mass energies (deviations were reported at \u221a s = 900 GeV by UA5, and later at Tevatron and LHC energies [26,52,53]). This issue is largely avoided when one restricts the NBD fit to the region around the mean of the distribution. The fit used in this analysis starts at N tracks = 3, where the CSE signal to background ratio is expected to be negligible, and ends at N tracks = 35, slightly above the maximum of the distribution. The extrapolation of the fit to the first multiplicity bins provides an estimate of the non-CSE background. The results of the NBD fits are shown in Fig. 6 (right). To check the performance of the method, the fit is repeated on the SS sample in the range 3 \u2264 N tracks \u2264 35. The extrapolation of the fit to the N tracks < 3 region agrees with the number of events observed in the SS sample data, which confirms the validity of this approach.",

The method involving the SS sample is used as a systematic check, as discussed in the next section. The non-CSE background contributes about 10-15% of the events in the 0th bin of the multiplicity distribution, about 25-35% in the first two multiplicity bins, and about 40-60% when the signal is integrated over the first three multiplicity bins. Figure 7 shows the track multiplicity distribution in the three bins of p jet2 T after subtracting the non-CSE background. A clear excess in the lowest bins is observed over a flat continuum, in agreement with the normalized predictions from a herwig 6 subsample with jet-gap-jet events only (no additional MPI); the jet-gap-jet events with additional MPI producing tracks in the rapidity gap are part of the background subtracted from the track multiplicity distributions, and are not included in the figure. In the region of the excess (CSE signal region), most events are in the 0th bin, with smaller contributions from events with one or two tracks reconstructed in the gap region. These tracks originate from the jets but are reconstructed outside of the jet cone, and their contribution is larger in the highest p jet2 T bin, for which jets tend to have a higher multiplicity and to be produced more centrally (closer to the gap).

All the measurements are based on the same pseudora-  pidity range for the gap region, but differ in the selection of jets. D0 and CDF use the cone jet reconstruction algorithm with size parameter R = 0.7, and select jets in the regions 1.9 < |\u03b7 jet | < 4.1, and 1.8 < |\u03b7 jet | < 3.5, respectively. The latter difference only minimally affects the comparison with the CMS results, as the measured f CSE fractions at 0.63 and 1.8 TeV depend only weakly on the gap size. At all the three collision energies f CSE increases with p jet2 T . This reflects the fact that the cross section for dijet events with a gap decreases with p jet2 T less rapidly than the inclusive dijet cross section does. In addition, a decrease of the gap fraction with increasing \u221a s is observed. The value of f CSE measured for 40 < p jet2 T < 60 GeV at \u221a s = 7 TeV is about a factor of two lower than those measured for the same p jet2 T at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV. This behavior is in agreement with observations by D0 and CDF, which reported that the jet-gap-jet fraction decreases by a factor of 2.5\u00b10.9 [27] and 3.4 \u00b1 1.2 [30], respectively, when \u221a s increases from 0.63 to 1.8 TeV. The decrease of f CSE with increasing energy can  [21], and of the Ekstedt, Enberg, and Ingelman (EEI) model [22,23] with three different treatments of the gap survival probability factor |S| 2 , as described in the text. The results are plotted at the mean value of p jet2 T in the bin. The inner and outer error bars represent the statistical, and the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature, respectively be ascribed to a stronger contribution from rescattering processes, in which the interactions between spectator partons destroy the rapidity gap [19,54]. As a consequence, the gap survival probability factor |S| 2 is expected to decrease with collision energy. Although no explicit predictions for |S| 2 currently exist for jet-gap-jet production at \u221a s = 7 TeV, a suppression factor of about 2, for \u221a s increasing from 1.8 to 7 TeV, is predicted for central exclusive production [55,56]. Figure 9 shows the comparison of the present results with the BFKL-based theoretical calculations of the Mueller and Tang (MT), and Ekstedt, Enberg and Ingelman (EEI) models. The gap fractions are plotted relative to the standard LO QCD dijet production rates, calculated with pythia 6 (using tune Z2* for MT, and the default settings with color reconnection features turned off for EEI). The MT model [21] prediction is based on the LL BFKL evolution in the asymptotic limit of large rapidity separations between the jets, and is obtained with herwig 6 (as described in Sect. 3, without reweighting of the p jet2 T dependence) for pure jet-gap-jet events (no simulation of MPI). The MT prediction does not reproduce the increase of f CSE with p jet2 T , as already observed for the 1.8 TeV data [22]; it also underestimates the f CSE fractions measured at 7 TeV. The EEI predictions [23] are based on the model of Ref. [22] extended to the present energy. The model includes the dominant next-to-LL corrections to the BFKL evolution of the parton-level cross section, as well as the effect of rescattering processes. For the latter, three approaches are considered, in which gap survival probability is either assumed to be a constant factor, or is partially or fully simulated using Monte Carlo models, to take into account its dependence on the variables p jet2 T and \u0394\u03b7 jj . In the first approach, the BFKL cross section is scaled by a constant factor corresponding to a gap survival probability value of |S| 2 = 0.7% (magenta long-dashed curve in Fig. 9), in order to match the data. Alternatively, the activity originating from perturbative gluons is modeled in terms of initial-and final-state parton showers, MPI and hadronization processes, as implemented in pythia 6. The remaining nonperturbative interactions are simulated either by an additional gap survival probability factor of |S| 2 = 1.5% (green dotted line in Fig. 9), or by soft color interactions (SCI, red dashed line in Fig. 9) where a color exchange with negligible momentum transfer occurs between parton clusters [23].",
