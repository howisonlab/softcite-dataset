The dataset was collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . As no excess of events above the Standard Model prediction is observed, the results are used to set upper limits on the W boson cross-section times branching ratio to an electron or muon and a neutrino as a function of the W mass. Assuming a W boson with the same couplings as the Standard Model W boson, W masses below 5.1 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.",

For example, heavy gauge bosons are predicted in left-right symmetric models [2,3] or in the little Higgs model [4]. Conceptually, these particles are heavier versions of the SM W and Z bosons and are generically referred to as W and Z bosons. The Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [5] posits a W SSM boson with couplings to fermions that are identical to those of the SM W boson. This model represents a good benchmark as the results can be interpreted in the context of other models of new physics, and is useful for comparing the sensitivity of different experiments.",

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of a silicon pixel detector including an additional inner layer located at a radius of 3.2 cm since 2015 [9], followed by silicon microstrip and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral experienced by tracks in the toroidal field ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m for most pseudorapidities. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers, over |\u03b7| < 2.7, and fast detectors for triggering, over |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [10]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information.

The SM background mainly arises from processes with at least one prompt final-state lepton, with the largest source being the charged-current Drell-Yan (DY) W boson production, where the W boson decays into an electron or muon and a neutrino. The second largest source is top-quark pair (tt) and single-top-quark production, denoted in the following as \"top-quark background\". Other non-negligible contributions are from the neutral-current DY (Z /\u03b3 * ) process, diboson production, as well as from events in which one final-state jet or photon satisfies the lepton selection criteria. This last component of the background, referred to in the following as the multijet background, receives contributions from multijet, heavy-flavour quark and \u03b3 + jet production. The multijet background is determined using a datadriven method, while the other backgrounds are modelled by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The backgrounds from W \u2192 \u03bd, Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 , W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, and Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 were simulated using the Powheg-Box v2 [11] matrix-element calculation up to next-toleading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), interfaced to the Pythia 8.186 [12] parton shower model and using the CT10 parton distribution func-tion (PDF) set [13]. The final-state photon radiation (QED FSR) was modelled by the Photos [14] MC simulation.

In addition to the modelling of QED FSR, a fixed-order electroweak (EW) correction to NLO is calculated as a function of the boson mass with the Mcsanc [17,18] event generator at leading order (LO) in pQCD. This correction is added to the NNLO QCD cross-section prediction in the so-called additive approach (see Sect. 6.2) because of a lack of calculations of mixed QCD and EW terms, and lowers the predicted cross-section by an increasing amount as function of the mass, reaching about 10% at 1 TeV and 20% at 5 TeV.

The single-top-quark production in the W t channel and EW t-channel was simulated using the same event generators and PDF sets as for the tt process, with the exception that the Powheg-Box v1 program was used for producing events in the t-channel. Diboson events were simulated with the Sherpa 2.1.1 [21] event generator using the CT10 PDF set. As the simulated top-quark and diboson samples are statistically limited at large m T , the expected number of events from each of these backgrounds is extrapolated into the high-m T region. This is achieved by fitting the lower part of the m T distributions to functions of the form F(x) = a x b+c log x and F(x) = d/(x + e) g , where x = m T / \u221a s, and using the fitted function to predict the background at higher m T .

Potential contamination of prompt final-state leptons in the backgroundenriched sample is accounted for using MC simulation. In addition, the fraction r of real leptons in the sample of loose candidates satisfying the nominal requirements is used. This fraction is computed from MC simulation.

The W boson is assumed not to couple to the SM W and Z bosons and interference between the W and the SM W boson production amplitudes is neglected. The decay W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, where the \u03c4 subsequently decays leptonically, is not treated as part of the signal as this contribution was quantified previously and found to give a negligible contribution to the sensitivity [23]. Mass-dependent correction factors are applied to normalise the samples to the same massdependent NNLO pQCD calculation as used for the W background.

The dominant effect comes from the PDF uncertainty, which is obtained from the 90% CL CT14NNLO PDF uncertainty set using VRAP to calculate the NNLO cross-section as a function of the boson mass. Rather than using the original 28 CT14 uncertainty eigenvectors, a re-diagonalised set of seven PDF eigenvectors, as provided by the authors of the CT14 PDF using MP4LHC [34,35], is used. The crosssection variation associated with each of these eigenvectors has a characteristic mass dependence and the sum in quadrature of these eigenvector variations matches the original CT14NNLO uncertainty envelope well. This sum is shown as \"PDF variation\" in Table 2. An additional uncertainty is derived to account for the choice of the nominal PDF set used. The central values of the CT14NNLO PDF set are compared to the MMHT2014 [36] and NNPDF3.0 [37] PDF sets. A comparison between these PDF sets shows that the central value for NNPDF3.0 falls outside the \"PDF variation\" uncertainty at large m T . Thus, an envelope of the \"PDF variation\" and the NNPDF3.0 central value is formed, where the former is subtracted in quadrature from this envelope, and the remaining part, which is non-zero only when the NNPDF3.0 central value is outside the \"PDF variation\" uncertainty, is quoted as \"PDF choice\". The PDF uncertainties are the same at the generator level for the electron and muon channels, but result in different uncertainties at reconstruction level. The uncertainty is larger in the electron channel due to the better energy resolution: there is less migration of events with low generator-level invariant mass, where the PDF uncertainty is smaller, into the high-m T region in this channel.",

            "text": "For the statistical analysis of the results presented in this section, the same methodology is applied as in the previous ATLAS W search [6] and is described briefly here. The compatibility between the data and the predicted background is evaluated with a profile-likelihood ratio test quantifying the probability that the background fluctuates to give a signal-like excess equal to or larger than what is observed. The likelihood functions in the ratio are products of Poisson probabilities over all bins in the transverse mass distribution (as shown in Fig. 1) and log-normal constraints for the variations in signal and background yields associated with systematic uncertainties. In the denominator of the likelihood ratio, the likelihood function is maximised assuming the presence of a signal above the expected background, and in the numerator assuming the background-only hypothesis. To model the signal, W SSM templates binned in m T are used for a series of W SSM masses in the search range 150 GeV \u2264 m W \u2264 6000 GeV. Figure 1 displays a few examples of these templates. No significant excesses are observed in the data. The most significant excess is at m W = 350 GeV in the electron channel, with a local significance of 2.0\u03c3 . In the muon channel, the most significant excess is at high mass, with a maximum local significance of 1.8\u03c3 at m W \u2248 5 TeV. These excesses correspond to a global significance of 0.1\u03c3 in each channel when the look-elsewhere effect [43] is taken into account.   Based on the above findings, upper limits on the crosssection for producing a W SSM boson times its branching ratio to only one lepton generation (\u03c3 \u00d7 BR) are computed at the 95% CL as a function of the W SSM boson mass. The limits are calculated in a Bayesian analysis [44] with a uniform positive prior probability distribution for \u03c3 \u00d7 BR. The observed upper limits are extracted by comparing data to the expected background and signal using W SSM templates for the same range of signal masses as for the profile-likelihood ratio test. The expected limits are derived from pseudo-experiments obtained from the estimated background distributions. The median of the distribution of the limits from the pseudoexperiments is taken as the expected limit, and 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 bands are defined as the ranges containing respectively 68 and 95% of the limits obtained with the pseudo-experiments.",

The theoretical uncertainties and the uncertainties in E miss T , jet energy resolution and luminosity are treated as correlated between the channels. The expected upper limit on \u03c3 \u00d7 BR is stronger in the electron channel. This results from the larger acceptance times efficiency and the better momentum resolution (see Sect. 5). Figure 2 also shows the predicted \u03c3 \u00d7 BR for the W SSM boson as a function of its mass as well as the uncertainties from the PDF, \u03b1 s and the factorisation and renormalisation scales derived using the same prescription as used for the W boson production. The observed (expected) lower mass limit for a W SSM boson, as summarised in Table 3, is 5.1 (5.2) TeV for the combination of the electron and muon channels.
