The gluon polarisation can be measured via the Photon-Gluon-Fusion (PGF) process. One of the methods to identify this process is selecting high pT hadron pairs in the final state [2]. The data used for this analysis were collected by the COMPASS experiment during the years 2002 to 2006, using a 160 GeV naturally polarised positive muon beam impinging on a polarised nucleon target. A new result of \u2206G/G from high pT hadron pairs in events with Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 is presented. This result has a better precision due to the addition of 2006 data and an improved analysis based on a neural network approach. The gluon polarisation is also presented in three bins of xG.",

In order to investigate x G dependence of \u2206G/G the data is divided into three bins of the parametrised x G variable, i.e. divided into three independent samples. These results are given in table 2 and also presented in figure 2. In the same figure, other results from the COMPASS collaboration are also depicted, together with results from HERMES and SMC experiments.
