            "text": "A search is presented for an excess of events with large missing transverse momentum in association with at least one highly energetic jet, in a data sample of protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results are interpreted using a set of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is achieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a hadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of 80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS analysis using the same data set. No significant excess with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are placed on the parameter space of the simplified models. Mediator masses between 80 and 400 GeV in the scalar and pseudoscalar models, and up to 1.5 TeV in the vector and axial vector models, are excluded.",

            "text": "Several astrophysical observations, including those of the radial distribution of galactic rotational speeds [1][2][3] and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background [4,5], suggest an abundance of a nonbaryonic form of matter in the universe. The existence of dark matter (DM) provides some of the most compelling evidence for physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics [6,7]. In many theories that extend the SM, production of DM particles is expected at the LHC. Monojet searches [8-14] provide sensitivity to a wide range of models for DM production at the LHC, while mono-V (where V=W or Z boson) searches [15][16][17][18] target models for DM production associated with SM V-bosons. While the mono-V searches target more specific models, they benefit from smaller SM backgrounds. The interpretation of results from these and other DM searches at the LHC has typically used effective field theories that assume heavy mediators and DM production via contact interactions [19][20][21]. The results of this analysis are interpreted in the context of a spin-0 or spin-1 mediator decaying to a pair of DM particles, using a set of simplified DM models [22][23][24][25] that span a broad range of mediator and DM particle masses, for a specific benchmark point in the model parameter space. In the limit of large mediator masses, these simplified models are well reproduced by the EFT approach. The models provide a simplified description of DM production that is applicable across the full kinematic region accessible at the LHC. Furthermore, within the framework of these models, a straightforward comparison can be made of the limits obtained by LHC experiments with those of direct detection (DD) experiments.",

Charged-particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip trackers, which cover a pseudorapidity (\u03b7) region of |\u03b7| < 2.5. A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), surround the tracking volume and cover |\u03b7| < 3. The steel and quartz-fiber Cherenkov forward calorimeter extends the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5. The CMS muon system consists of gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid, covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of specialized hardware processors, is designed to select the most interesting events in less than 4 \u00b5s, using information from the calorimeters and the muon detectors.

For the vector and axial vector mediators, the terms g DM and g SM denote the couplings of the mediator to the DM particle and to SM particles, respectively. In all models considered, these couplings are assumed to be unity (g SM = g DM = 1). For the vector and axial vector mediators, this implies that the coupling is universal between the mediator and quarks of all flavours. For the scalar and pseudoscalar models, g q = 1 is assumed for all quark flavours, which implies a SM Higgs-like coupling of the mediator to the SM fermions. The split in terms of axial vector and vector mediators in the Lagrangian parallels the existing separation in DD experiments, into spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) interactions; SI can refer to either vector or scalar mediated interactions while SD interactions refer to axial vector mediated processes. Pseudoscalar DM-nucleon interaction cross sections are suppressed at non-relativistic DM velocities, leading to a limited sensitivity for DD experiments to this type of interaction [35,36]. For spin-1 signatures, the DM production process is analogous to Z boson production via quark scattering, as shown in figure 2. The mono-V and monojet signatures follow from -3 -",

In such spin-0 models, the coupling of the mediator to SM quarks can be mass-dependent as parameterized in eqs. (3.3) and (3.4). In these models, the production of DM at hadron colliders occurs predominantly through gluon-fusion via a top quark loop as shown in figure 1 (left). When couplings of the mediator to vector bosons are present, mono-V signatures are produced through a radiative process, as indicated in figure 1 (right). The scenario in which couplings between the mediator and vector bosons are not considered, is denoted herein as fermionic. For fermionic models, the mediator width is calculated assuming that it couples only to quarks and DM particles. This is referred to as the minimal width constraint. For the case in which couplings between the mediator and V-bosons are allowed, the width is modified to account for the additional contributions that arise [34].",

The disagreement is within the systematic uncertainties of the selection efficiency that are included in this analysis. In cases where the V-boson has insufficient boost for its hadronic decay to be fully contained in a single reconstructed CA8 jet, a selection that targets V-boson decays into a pair of AK5 jets is applied to recover events failing the V-boosted selection. This selection requires that each jet has p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and that the dijet system has a mass in the range 60-110 GeV, consistent with originating from a W or Z boson. To reduce the combinatorial background in this V-resolved category, a multivariate (MVA) selection criterion is applied. The inputs to the MVA are the jet pull angle [79], the mass drop variable [80], and a likelihood-based discriminator that distinguishes quark-originated from gluon-originated jets [81]. In events where multiple dijet pairs are found, the pair with the highest MVA output value is taken as the candidate. The distributions of the MVA output for SM backgrounds and for a scalar mediator produced in association with a Vboson are shown in figure 4. The disagreement observed between the data and simulation is included as a systematic uncertainty in the efficiency of the V-resolved category selection for the top quark and diboson backgrounds. Events are included in the V-resolved category if they have an MVA output greater than 0.6. This selection is optimal for mono-V signals with a spin-0 mediator with m MED < 300 GeV [81].",

Events which pass a given selection are not included in any subsequent category. Figure 5 shows the E miss T and leading jet p T distributions in data and simulation after selection for the three event classes combined. The backgrounds are normalized to the integrated luminosity of the data samples, and the expected distribution for vector mediated DM production assuming m DM =10 GeV and m MED =1 TeV is overlaid. The discrepancy between the data and simulation is a result of both detector resolution and an imperfect theoretical description of the kinematics of the V + jets processes. Both effects are corrected using control samples in data, as described in the following section.",

The requirement on the number of jets (N j ) is applied in the V-boosted and monojet categories. An additional jet is allowed only if it falls within |\u2206\u03c6| < 2 radians of the leading AK5 or CA8 jet for the monojet or V-boosted category. The additional AK5 jets in the V-boosted category must be further than \u2206R > 0.5 for the event to fail this criteria.  spectrum in these events is significantly better than that achieved in the simple counting analysis described in the previous CMS paper [9]. Additional improvement is achieved by using control regions in data to reduce the uncertainties in the predictions of the SM backgrounds. These regions are statistically independent from the signal region and de-JHEP12(2016)083 signed such that the expected contribution from a potential signal is negligible. A binned likelihood fit is performed in the ranges 250-1000 GeV and 200-1000 GeV for the two Vtagged and monojet categories, respectively. The binning is chosen to ensure that each corresponding bin of a set of control regions is populated. The width of the highest E miss T bin is chosen to provide ease of comparison with the previous CMS search [9].",

The events in the control regions are divided into the three categories, using the selection criteria described in section 4, but replacing the lepton and photon vetoes with a requirement of the presence of one of the following: a pair of oppositely charged muons consistent with a Z boson decay, a high p T photon, or a single muon consistent with a leptonic W boson decay. This yields a total of nine control regions; three for each event category. In the control regions, the transverse momentum of the dimuon pair, the single muon, or the photon is removed and the E miss T is recalculated. This quantity is referred to as pseudo-E miss T and it is this variable to which the E miss T selection of the corresponding signal region applies. The distribution of pseudo-E miss T in the control regions is used to estimate the distribution of E miss T expected from the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets and W( \u03bd) + jets backgrounds in the signal region. The dimuon control region is defined using the signal region selection criteria without the muon veto. Exactly two isolated muons with opposite charge, p \u00b5 1 T , p \u00b5 2 T > 20, 10 GeV and an invariant mass in the range 60-120 GeV are required. As the decay branching fraction of B(Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is approximately six times smaller than that to neutrinos, the resulting statistical uncertainty in the Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background becomes a dominant systematic uncertainty at large values of E miss T . A complementary approach is to use events in data that have a high-p T photon recoiling against jets to further constrain the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets [83]. This is advantageous since the production cross section of \u03b3 + jets is roughly a factor of three times that of the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets, yielding thereby a smaller statistical uncertainty in the predicted background. However, the theoretical uncertainties associated with the translation of the kinematics in \u03b3 + jets events to that of Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets events are significant. A combination of both photon and dimuon control regions is used to maximally constrain the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets background.",

Additionally, the transverse mass, calculated as m T = \u221a terms are free parameters of the likelihood representing the yields of Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets and W( \u03bd) + jets in each bin of the signal regions. The additional terms R W i , R Z i , and R \u03b3 i denote factors that account for the extrapolation of specific backgrounds from the signal region to control regions. The likelihood function for a particular event category is given by i account for the ratio of B(Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)/B(Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and the muon efficiency times acceptance in the dimuon control region, while R \u03b3 i account for the ratio of differential cross sections between the Z + jets and \u03b3 + jets processes and the efficiency times acceptance of the photon selection for the \u03b3 + jets control region. The differential cross sections of photon and Z production are corrected using NLO k-factors obtained from a comparison of their p T distributions in events generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 [66], to the distributions produced at LO. These k-factors are propagated to the factors R \u03b3 i to account for NLO QCD effects. Systematic uncertainties are modelled as constrained nuisance parameters that allow variation of the factors R \u03b3 i , R Z i and R W i in the fit. These include theoretical uncertainties in the photon to Z differential cross section ratio from renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties, which amount to 8% each across the relevant boson p T range. These uncertainties are conservative in that they are estimated by taking the maximum difference in the ratio derived from varying each scale by a factor of two, independently for the two processes, thereby ignoring any cancellation of the scale uncertainties. Electroweak corrections are not accounted for in the simulation. Additional k-factors are applied as a function of the boson (Z or \u03b3) p T , to account for higher order electroweak effects, which are around 15% for a boson p T around 1 TeV [84]. The full correction is taken as an uncertainty in the ratio. A conservative choice is made in assuming this uncertainty to be uncorrelated across bins of E miss T .

A local significance of the data in each bin is calculated by comparing the likelihood between the background-only fit (figure 9) and a fit in which the total expected yield of events in that bin is fixed to the observation in data. The largest local significance observed using this procedure is 1.9 standard deviations and corresponds to the largest E miss T bin of the monojet category. The results are interpreted using the set of simplified models for DM production described in section 3. Exclusion limits are set for these models using the asymptotic CL s method [90][91][92] with a profile likelihood ratio as the test statistic, in which systematic uncertainties in the signal and background models are modelled as constrained nuisance parameters. For each signal hypothesis tested, upper limits are placed on the ratio of the signal yield to that predicted by the simplified model, denoted as \u00b5. Limits are presented in terms of excluded regions in the m MED \u2212 m DM plane, assuming scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, determined as the points for which \u00b5 > 1 is excluded at the 90% confidence level (CL) or above. The choice of 90% CL exclusions is made to allow comparison with other experiments. Limits are calculated for a set of points in the plane and then interpolated to derive exclusion contours. In the region m MED < 200 GeV, m DM < 200 GeV, the limit is calculated in 10 GeV steps in both DM and mediator masses. Data/Pred. For the region 200 < m MED < 500 GeV, m DM < 500 GeV, a spacing of 25 GeV is used. For mediator masses larger than 500 GeV the generated signal points are separated by 100 GeV. The expected number of signal events in each of the three event categories arising from monojet and mono-V production for a vector and axial vector mediator with a mass of 1 TeV, a scalar mediator with a mass of 125 GeV, and a pseudoscalar mediator with a mass of 400 GeV is shown in  Table 5.

The sum of these contributions in each category is used when setting limits, except in the fermionic case, for which the contribution from the mono-V signal is ignored. Experimental systematic uncertainties, including jet and E miss T response and resolution uncertainties, are included in the signal model as nuisance parameters, while the theoretical systematic uncertainties in the inclusive cross section are instead added as additional contours on the exclusion limits. These include the effect of varying the renormalization and factorization scales by a factor of two, and the PDF uncertainties, which result in 20% and 30% variations in the signal yield, when summed in quadrature, for the vector and axial vector, and scalar and pseudoscalar models, respectively. These are the largest values found across the full range of the mediator mass from 10 GeV to 3 TeV, although the variation of these uncertainties in this range is found to be small. The same values are assumed for every signal point, thus giving a conservative estimate of the uncertainty. Figure 10 shows the 90% CL exclusions for the vector, axial vector, scalar, and pseudoscalar mediator models. The 90% upper limit on \u00b5 (\u00b5 up ), when assuming that the mediator couples only to fermions (fermionic), is shown by the blue color scale. As described in section 3, the limits are calculated assuming a minimum width for the signal [21,22,25,93]. For the pseudoscalar interpretation, there is a region of masses between 150 and 280 GeV for which the decrease in cross section with larger mediator mass is balanced by an increase in acceptance for the signal, so that the expected signal contribution remains roughly constant. The expected value of \u00b5 up is larger than 1 in this region, resulting in an \"island\" at small m DM , where no exclusion is expected at the 90% CL. However, the observed value of \u00b5 up is smaller than 1 throughout this region at 90% CL, thus the island is not present in the observed limits.",

It should be noted that the limits set from this analysis are only valid for the simplified model, and in particular that they assume g DM = g SM = g q = 1. For the scalar mediator model, it is assumed that only heavy quarks (top and bottom) contribute. Such a choice limits the sensitivity for DD experiments, however, it allows the direct comparison between collider and DD experiments without an additional assumption for the light-quark couplings [100].

The most appropriate comparison is therefore to the most sensitive bounds on indirect detection from the Fermi LAT collaboration [110,111]. These limits apply to a scenario in which DM annihilates in the centre of a galaxy, producing a \u03b3 ray signature. The signature can be interpreted as DM annihilation to b quark pairs, allowing direct comparison with limits from this analysis [34,112,113]. Figure 11(bottom-right) shows the exclusion contours assuming pseudoscalar mediation in the plane of DM pair annihilation cross section versus m DM . It is assumed that only heavy quarks contribute in the production of the mediator, while for the interpretation of the Fermi LAT limits in the annihilation cross section, it is assumed that the mediator decays only to b quark pairs. As with all of the simplified model interpretations, the DM particle is assumed to be a Dirac fermion. The results shown from Fermi LAT have been scaled by a factor of two compared to ref. [110], because of the assumption of a Majorana DM fermion made by that analysis. The limits from this analysis improve on those from Fermi LAT for DM masses up to 150 GeV.",

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Sensitivity to a potential mono-V signature is achieved by the addition of two event categories that select hadronically decaying V-bosons using novel jet substructure techniques. This search is the first at CMS to use jet substructure techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. The sensitivity of the search has been increased compared to the previous CMS result by using the full shape of the E miss  Figure 11.

Also shown is the 90% CL exclusion in DM annihilation cross section as a function of m DM for a pseudoscalar mediator (bottom-right). For the scalar and pseudoscalar mediators, the exclusion contours assuming the mediator only couples to fermions (fermionic) is also shown. The excluded region in all plots is to the top-left of the contours for the results from this analysis while the DD experiments and Fermi LAT excluded regions are above the lines shown. In the vector and axial vector models, limits are shown independently for monojet, V-boosted, and V-resolved categories. The red dot-dashed line shows the partial combination of the V-tagged categories for which the V-boosted category provides the dominant contribution. In all of the mediator models, a minimum mediator width is assumed. For the pseudoscalar mediator, 68% CL preferred regions, obtained using data from Fermi LAT, for DM annihilation to light-quarks (qq), \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , and bb are given by the solid green, hatched pink, and shaded brown coloured regions, respectively. standard model backgrounds and by using additional data control regions. No significant deviation is observed in the E miss T distributions relative to the expectation from standard model backgrounds. The results of the search are interpreted under a set of simplified models that describe the production of dark matter (DM) particle pairs via vector, axial vector, scalar, or pseudoscalar mediation. Constraints are placed on the parameter space of these models. The search was the first at CMS to be interpreted using the simplified models for DM production. The search excludes DM production via vector or axial vector mediation with mediator masses up to 1.5 TeV, within the simplified model assumptions.",
