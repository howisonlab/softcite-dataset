At the 7 TeV LHC center-of-mass energy, the most probable way to produce B \u00f0\u00c3\u00de\u00fe c mesons is through the gg-fusion process, gg ! B \u00f0\u00c3\u00de\u00fe c \u00fe b \u00fe \" c [1]. The production cross section of the B \u00fe c meson has been calculated by a complete order-4 s approach and using the fragmentation approach [1]. It is predicted to be about 0:4 b [2,3] at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV including contributions from excited states. This is 1 order of magnitude higher than that predicted at the Tevatron energy ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV.",

These measurements are performed using 0:37 fb \u00c01 of data collected in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV by the LHCb experiment. The LHCb detector [7] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a largearea silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a muon system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The muon identification efficiency is about 97%, with a misidentification probability \u00f0 ! \u00de $ 3%.",

The two muons are required to originate from a common vertex. Candidates with a dimuon invariant mass between 3.04 and 3:14 GeV=c 2 are combined with charged hadrons with p T > 1:5 GeV=c to form the B \u00fe c and B \u00fe meson candidates. The J=c mass window is about seven times larger than the mass resolution. No particle identification is used in the selection of the hadrons. To improve the B \u00fe c and B \u00fe mass resolutions, the mass of the \u00fe \u00c0 pair is constrained to the J=c mass [10]. The b-hadron candidates are required to have p T > 4 GeV=c, decay time t > 0:25 ps and pseudorapidity in the range 2:5 < < 4:5. The fiducial region is chosen to be well inside the detector acceptance to have a reasonably flat efficiency over the phase space. To further suppress background to the B \u00fe c decay, the IP 2 values of the J=c and \u00fe candidates with respect to any primary vertex (PV) in the event are required to be larger than 4 and 25, respectively. The IP 2 is defined as the difference between the 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered particle. The IP 2 of the B \u00fe c candidates with respect to at least one PV in the event is required to be less than 25. After all selection requirements are applied, no event has more than one candidate for the B \u00fe c !

The B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe signal mass shape is described by a double-sided Crystal Ball function [11]. The power law behaviour toward low mass is due primarily to final state radiation from the bachelor hadron, whereas the high mass tail is mainly due to final state radiation from the muons in combination with the J=c mass constraint. The B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe signal mass shape is described by the sum of two double-sided Crystal Ball functions that share the same mean but have different resolutions. From simulated decays, it is found that the tail parameters of the double-sided Crystal Ball function depend mildly on the mass resolution. This functional dependence is determined from simulation and included in the mass fit. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function. Background to B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe from the Cabibbo-suppressed decay B \u00fe ! J=c \u00fe is included to improve the fit quality. The distribution is determined from the simulated events. The ratio of the number of B \u00fe ! J=c \u00fe decays to that of the signal is fixed to B\u00f0B \u00fe ! J=c \u00fe \u00de=B\u00f0B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe \u00de \u00bc 3:83% [12]. The Cabibbo-suppressed decay B \u00fe c ! J=c K \u00fe is neglected as a source of background to the B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe decay. The invariant mass distributions of the selected B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe and B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe candidates and the fits to the data are shown in Fig. 1. The numbers of signal events are 162 AE 18 for B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe and 56243 AE 256 for B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe , as obtained from the fits. The goodness of fits is checked with a 2 test, which returns a probability of 97% for B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe and 87% for B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe . The efficiencies, including geometrical acceptance, reconstruction, selection and trigger effects are determined using simulated signal events. The production of the B \u00fe meson is simulated using PYTHIA 6.4 [13] with the configuration described in Ref. [14]. A dedicated generator BCVEGPY [15] is used to simulate the B \u00fe c meson production. Decays of B \u00fe c , B \u00fe and J=c mesons are described by EVTGEN [16] in which final state radiation is generated using PHOTOS [17]. The decay products are traced through the detector by the GEANT4 package [18] as described in Ref. [19]. As the efficiencies depend on p T and , the efficiencies from the simulation are binned in these variables to avoid a bias. The signal yield in each bin is obtained from data by subtracting the background contribution using the sPlot technique [20], where the signal and background mass shapes are assumed to be uncorrelated with p T and . The efficiency-corrected numbers of B \u00fe c ! J=c \u00fe and B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe signal decays are 2470 AE 350 and 364188 AE 2270, respectively, corresponding to a ratio of R c=u \u00bc \u00f00:68 AE 0:10\u00de%, where the uncertainties are statistical only. ",

The amount of material traversed by a particle in the tracking system is known to 10% accuracy, the magnitude of the energy loss correction in the reconstruction is therefore varied by 10%. To quantify the effects due to the alignment uncertainty, the horizontal and vertical slopes of the tracks close to the interaction region, which are determined by measurements in the vertex detector, are changed by AE0:1%, corresponding to the estimated precision of the length scale along the beam axis [25]. To test the relative alignment of different subdetectors, the analysis is repeated ignoring the hits of the tracking station between the vertex detector and the magnet. Other uncertainties arise from the signal and background line shapes. The bias due to the final state radiation is studied using a simulation based on PHOTOS [17].
