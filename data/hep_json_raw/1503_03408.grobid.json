            "text": "The charmonium-like states discovered in recent years have drawn great attention from both theorists and experimentalists for their exotic properties, as reviewed e.g. in Ref. [1]. Being well above the open charm threshold, the strong coupling of these states to hidden charm processes makes their interpretation as conventional charmonium states very difficult. On the other hand, the theory of the strong interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), does not prohibit the existence of exotic states beyond the quark model, e.g. molecular states, tetraquark states, hybrid states, etc. Either the verification or the exclusion of the existence of such states will help to evaluate the quark model and better understand QCD. Even though some states have been identified as higher excited charmonium states, such as the \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415), their large widths and interference with each other make their precise study complicated. In addition, the relationship between the charmonium-like states and higher excited charmonium states is still not clear. Precise knowledge of the timeintegrated luminosity is essential for quantitative analysis of these states.",

The energy resolution for 1.0 GeV photons is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (endcaps), while the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) in the barrel (endcaps); (c) A time-of-flight system (TOF), constructed of 5 cm thick plastic scintillators, arranged in 88 detectors of 2.4 m length in two layers in the barrel and 96 fanshaped detectors in the endcaps. The barrel (endcap) time resolution of 80 ps (110 ps) provides 2\u03c3 K/\u03c0 separation for momenta up to about 1.0 GeV/c; (d) A muon counter (MUC), consisting of nine layers of resistive plate chambers in the barrel and eight layers for each endcap. It is incorporated in the iron return yoke of the superconducting magnet. Its position resolution is about 2 cm. A geant4 [4,5] based detector simulation package has been developed to model the detector response. Due to the crossing angle of the beams at the interaction point, the e + e \u2212 CM system is slightly boosted with respect to the laboratory frame.",

An energy threshold of 0.04 GeV was applied to the final state particles. The acollinearity of the events has not been constrained.

Reasonable agreement is observed in the angular and momentum distributions. The striking difference between data and simulation found in the distributions of energies deposited by the leptons in the EMC emerges from imperfections in the simulation of the energy response of individual detector channels. At the CM energies analyzed in this work, a single shower in the calorimeter can be so energetic that the deposited energy per crystal exceeds the dynamic range of the analog-todigital converter (ADC), causing individual ADC channels to saturate. In the analysis presented here, the very loose requirements on the energy deposits will not cause any bias, since they have been applied in regions of reasonable agreement between data and simulation.

The total uncertainty is dominated by the systematic uncertainty. A cross check with di-gamma events is performed and the results are consistent with each other. The result presented here is essential for future measurements of cross sections with these data, and has already been used in the discovery of charged charmonium-like states [9][10][11][12].",
