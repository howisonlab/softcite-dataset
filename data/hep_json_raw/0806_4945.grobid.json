This SME theory is an observerindependent framework that contains all the Lorentz violating (LV) terms involving particle fields in the Standard Model of particle physics and gravitational fields in the General Theory of Relativity. Since the Standard Model is thought to be the low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory that unifies quantum physics and gravity at the Planck scale, m P \u2243 10 19 GeV, it is suggested in [2] that the violations of Lorentz and CPT symmetries predicted by the SME provide a link to Planck scale physics. Although the magnitude of LV signatures in the accessible energy limit are suppressed by a factor of order the electroweak scale divided by the Planck scale, m W /m P \u223c 10 \u221217 [3], these low-energy probes of new physics have been explored in many ways with current experimental technologies [4].",

For experiments like MINOS [6] with both beam neutrino source and detector fixed on the Earth's surface, the Earth's sidereal rotation causes the direction of neutrino propagationp to change with respect to the Sun-centered inertial frame in which the SME is formulated [7]. The theory predicts that this rotation introduces a sidereal variation in the number of neutrinos detected from the beam. The LSND collaboration [7] did not see this signal. In this paper we use a sample of neutrinos identified in the MINOS near detector (ND) in a search for this sidereal signal. The neutrinos were generated by the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) neutrino beam at Fermilab [8], a beam whose flavor composition is 98.7% \u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 [6].",

In this equation, the expressions for (A c ) \u00b5x , (A s ) \u00b5x , and (C) \u00b5x include both CPT and Lorentz violating terms; the expressions for (B c ) \u00b5x and (B s ) \u00b5x include only Lorentz violating terms. Since CPT violation implies Lorentz violation in field theory [9], there are no terms that depend on CPT violation alone. These parameters are combinations of the SME coefficients (a L ) \u00b5 and (c L ) \u00b5\u03bd that describe LV [5]. The magnitude of the coefficients in eq. 1 Here \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the beam zenith and azimuthal angles; \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis which points toward the zenith; \u03c6 is defined from the x-axis which is along the detector axis and increases away from the NuMI target. The y-axis makes a right handed coordinate system. The explicit relationships between the SME coefficients and the beam direction are found in [5]. In eq. 1, the CPT violating terms depend on L and the Lorentz violating terms depend on L \u00d7 E \u03bd , where E \u03bd is the neutrino energy. This unconventional behavior is to be compared with the L/E \u03bd dependence of the oscillation probability resulting from non-zero neutrino masses [10]. The MINOS ND [11] is a magnetized 0.98 kton steel scintillator tracking calorimeter that lies 103 m underground at Fermilab and it is made of 282 4 \u00d7 6 m 2 octagonal planes. Each plane is comprised of a 2.54 cm thick steel plate and a layer of scintillator strips with dimensions of 4.1 cm \u00d7 1 cm. Each scintillator strip is coupled via wavelength-shifting fiber to one pixel of a 64-pixel Hamamatsu M64 PMT [12]. The ND readout continuously integrates the PMT charges, while the data acquisition accepts data above a threshold of 0.25 photoelectrons.",

The powers returned by these FFTs give the fluctuation spectrum expected from sidereal phase histograms in which there is no sidereal signal. As for the data, we computed the weighted mean power for each harmonic in a pair of simulated Run I and Run II experiments. The distributions for the even (cos ) and the odd (sin ) mean powers for harmonic frequencies out to 4\u03c9 \u2295 T \u2295 are shown superposed in Fig. 2. Clearly these even and odd distributions are nearly identical. In addition, a Gaussian of width \u03c3 = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22122 has been superposed onto these two distributions in Fig. 2. This fit was obtained independently for both distributions. We use this Gaussian to estimate the probability that the powers returned by the FFT analysis of the sidereal phase histograms in Fig. 1 are due to statistical fluctuations. Table II gives the probability, P F , that the mean power represents a noise fluctuation. It was calculated as the probability of drawing a value of the weighted mean power for the two data sets at least as large as found from the parent Gaussian distribution in Fig. 2. Since the largest fluctuation in the FFT power in the Fig. 1 histogram is 1.32\u03c3 we conclude that no term reaches the level of a 3\u03c3 detection. We have determined that these results are insensitive to the exact choice of the zero point of sidereal phase. This model-independent result implies that there is no significant change in normalized neutrino event rate that depends on the direction of the neutrino beam in a sun-centered inertial frame. In the context of the SME, this result is inconsistent with the detection of III: Limits to SME coefficients for \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bdx in terms of the suppression factor mW /mP \u223c 10 \u221217 ; aL have units of (GeV) and cL are unitless.",
