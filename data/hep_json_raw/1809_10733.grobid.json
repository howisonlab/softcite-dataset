            "text": "Combined measurements of the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson, as well as its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data set recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The combination is based on analyses targeting the five main Higgs boson production mechanisms (gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson, or a top quarkantiquark pair) and the following decay modes: H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , ZZ, WW, \u03c4 \u03c4 , bb, and \u03bc\u03bc. Searches for invisible Higgs boson decays are also considered. The best-fit ratio of the signal yield to the standard model expectation is measured to be \u03bc = 1.17 \u00b1 0.10, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. Additional results are given for various assumptions on the scaling behavior of the production and decay modes, including generic parametrizations based on ratios of cross sections and branching fractions or couplings. The results are compatible with the standard model predictions in all parametrizations considered. In addition, constraints are placed on various two Higgs doublet models.",

            "text": "Understanding the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) remains one of the main objectives of the physics program at the CERN LHC. In the standard model (SM) of particle physics [1][2][3][4], EWSB is realized through the addition of a complex scalar doublet field. A salient feature of this is the prediction of one physical, neutral, scalar particle, the Higgs boson (H) [5][6][7][8][9][10]. The Higgs scalar field can also account for the fermion masses through Yukawa interactions [2,11]. The Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [12][13][14], and is the subject of much study. The Yukawa coupling strengths are free parameters in the SM and do not explain the observed pattern of fermion masses. Furthermore, it is not understood why the e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch Higgs boson mass is near the electroweak scale, since it is not protected in the SM from large quantum corrections [15][16][17][18][19]. This has led to the development of many beyond the SM (BSM) theories that can alter the properties of the Higgs boson [20][21][22][23][24]. Precision measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson are therefore an important test of the SM.",

The prediction for ggH production has advanced to next-tonext-to-next-to-leading order (N 3 LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [29,30] and next-to-leading order (NLO) for electroweak (EW) corrections, reducing its uncertainty from +7.6% \u22128.1% (next-to-NLO) to +4.6% \u22126.7% . The calculations of the VBF and VH cross sections are performed at next-to-NLO QCD and NLO EW accuracy, while the calculation of the ttH cross section is performed at NLO QCD and NLO EW accuracy. The updated theoretical predictions used for the various production and decay modes in this paper can be found in Refs.  and are summarized in Ref. [53]. Examples of leading-order (LO) Feynman diagrams for these production processes can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3. In addition to the five main production processes, the contributions due to Higgs boson production in association with a single top quark (tH) and either a W boson (tHW) or a quark (tHq), as shown in Fig. 4, are included in the analyses that have some sensitivity to them. For certain measurements in this paper, such as ggH production and H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay, the interference between the diagrams that contribute to the process is considered. In addition, the tH cross section is small in the SM, being approximately 14% of the ttH cross section, due to the destructive interference between the diagrams shown in Fig. 4, which involve the coupling of the Higgs boson to W bosons (tHW process) and top quarks (tHq process). This interference becomes con-structive, however, when the relative sign between these couplings is negative, and so the tH process is sensitive to the relative sign of the HWW and ttH couplings.",

A combination of the Run 1 ATLAS and CMS analyses has also been performed [56]. All results were found to be in agreement, within their uncertainties, with the predictions of the SM. In this paper, due to the larger integrated luminosity and increased signal cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV, the measured precision for several parameters of interest has significantly increased with respect to Ref. [56]. In particular, the predicted cross sections for the dominant ggH production mode and the ttH production mode increase by factors of approximately 2.3 and 3.8, respectively, between \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV. In addition, some of the theoretical predictions have improved, as mentioned earlier.",

More detailed information on each analysis can be found in the corresponding references. Many of the analyses split their primary data sample in multiple event categories with specific signatures that enhance the discrimination power between different Higgs boson production processes. This is achieved through selections that require the presence of additional leptons or jets, as expected in the decay of a W or Z boson in the WH and ZH modes, or in top quark decays in the ttH mode, and that exploit the distinctive kinematic properties of the final state objects, such as the presence of two jets with a large separation in pseudorapidity \u0394\u03b7 jj , and a large invariant mass m jj , in the VBF topology. In some categories, the kinematic features of an event as a whole are used to select particular production processes. For example, requiring a large missing transverse momentum p miss T , defined as the magnitude of the negative vector sum over the transverse momenta p T of all particles reconstructed in an event, targets ZH production in which the Z boson decays to neutrinos. The event categories within and amongst the individual analyses are constructed to ensure a negligible level of overlap (i.e. the same event entering more than one category). In many cases, this is accomplished by synchronizing the object (e.g. electron, muon, tau, or jet) identification definitions and imposing strict requirements on the number of reconstructed objects. In other cases, the orthogonality is ensured by imposing opposing requirements on higher level observables formed using multiple objects. For rare cases where potential overlap is not explicitly removed, the lists of selected data events were checked and found to contain a negligible number of duplications. In total, up to 265 event categories are considered, and there are over 5500 nuisance parameters corresponding to various sources of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainty. A summary of the production and decay modes, which are described in more detail in the following sections, is shown in Table 1.",

As a result, this decay channel has very good sensitivity to most production processes, in particular ggH and VBF. Imposing tight lepton identification criteria and requiring the absence of b-tagged jets helps to reduce the misidentified lepton and top quark backgrounds, respectively. Several event categories with varying signal-to-background ratios are defined to improve the sensitivity to the signal.

The first column indicates the decay channel and the second column indicates the production mechanism targeted by an analysis. The third column provides the total number of categories per production tag, excluding control regions. Notes on the expected fractions of different Higgs signal production and decay modes with respect to the total signal yield in the given category are given in the fourth column. Where the numbers do not sum to 100%, the remaining contributions are from other signal production and decay processes. Finally, where relevant, the fifth column specifies the approximate expected relative mass resolution for the SM  Events are selected that contain two leptons, denoted 2 , which may be of different or same flavor. The differentflavor e\u03bc decay channel dominates the sensitivity since it has the largest branching fraction and is the least contaminated by backgrounds. The same-flavor ee and \u03bc\u03bc final states are also considered, although their sensitivity is limited by the contamination from Drell-Yan (DY) background events with misreconstructed p miss T . Given the large background contribution from tt production in both the differentflavor and same-flavor final states, events are further categorized into categories with 0, 1, and 2 associated jets, with the 0-jet category dominating the overall sensitivity. In addition, events are further categorized on the basis of the p T of the subleading lepton, since the background from misidentified leptons is larger in the lowp T region. In the differentflavor final state, dedicated 2-jet categories are included to enhance the sensitivity to VBF and VH production mechanisms.",

Events are separated into 0, 1, 2, and \u22653 jet bins, where the jets used for counting are clustered from all stable particles, excluding the decay products of the Higgs boson or associated vector bosons, and have p T > 30 GeV. The sums of weights in each sample are first normalized to the inclusive N 3 LO cross section. The ratio of the p T (H) distribution from the nnlops generator to that from the powheg or MadGraph5_amc@nlo generators in each jet bin is applied to the ggH signal samples. The reweighting procedure has been checked against fully simulated nnlops samples in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay channels and was found to give results compatible within the statistical uncertainty of the simulated samples. The H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and boosted H \u2192 bb analyses, which are much less sensitive to ggH production than other decay channels, use the NLO + PS simulation.",

This differs from the previous implementation, which utilized separate nuisance parameters for each process per bin. With the Barlow-Beeston approach, the maximum likelihood estimator for each of these nuisance parameters is independent from the others, and can be solved for analytically. This has been found to provide a significant reduction in the minimization time, while reproducing the results obtained with the full treatment to within 1%.",

The improvements in the precision are up to \u223c20% for the VBF and VH production rates compared to Ref. [55]. The uncertainty in the measurement of the ttH production rate is reduced by around 50% compared to Ref. [56]. This is in part due to the increase in the ttH cross section between 8 and 13 TeV, but also due to the inclusion of additional exclusive event categories for this production process. The most generic signal strength parametrization has one signal strength parameter for each production and decay mode combination, \u03bc f i . Given the five production and six decay modes listed above, this implies a model with 30 parameters of interest. However not all can be experimentally constrained in this combination. There is no dedicated analysis from CMS at \u221a s = 13 TeV targeting WH and ZH production with H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 decay, or VBF production with H \u2192 bb decay, therefore these signal strength modifiers are fixed to the SM expectation and are not included in the maximum likelihood fit. Likewise, the WH, ZH, and ttH production rates with H \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decay are fixed to the SM expectation. In the case of WH, ZH, and ttH production with H \u2192 ZZ decay, as well as ZH production with H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay, the background contamination is sufficiently low so that a negative signal strength can result in an overall negative event yield. Therefore, these signal strengths are restricted to nonnegative values. Figure 6 summarizes the results in this model along with the 1\u03c3 CL intervals. The numerical values, including the uncertainty decomposition into statistical and systematic parts, and the corresponding expected uncertainties, are given in Table 3.",

There are six free coupling parameters: \u03ba W , \u03ba Z , \u03ba t , \u03ba \u03c4 , \u03ba b , and \u03ba \u03bc . Without loss of generality, the value of \u03ba t is restricted to be positive, while both negative and positive values of \u03ba W , \u03ba Z and \u03ba b are allowed. In this model, the rates of the ggH and H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 processes, which occur through loop diagrams at leading order, are resolved, meaning that they are described by the functions of \u03ba W , \u03ba Z , \u03ba \u03c4 , and \u03ba b given in Table 6. The results of the fits with this parametrization are given in Fig. 9 and Table 7. The rate of the H \u2192 ZZ decay and ZH production depend only on the absolute value of \u03ba Z . The interference between the two diagrams shown in Fig. 3, however, allows contributions from the gg \u2192 ZH production mode to break the degeneracy between the signs, leading to a positive value of \u03ba Z being preferred. As these contributions are typically small compared to other production modes, the 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 intervals also include negative values of \u03ba Z . Although a negative value of \u03ba b is preferred in this model, the difference in q between  the best fit point and the minimum in the region \u03ba b > 0 is smaller than 0.1. An additional fit is performed using a phenomenological parametrization relating the masses of the fermions and vector bosons to the corresponding \u03ba modifiers using two parameters, denoted M and [113,114]. In such a model one can relate the coupling modifiers to M and as \u03ba F = v m f /M 1+ for fermions and  [115]. The SM expectation, \u03ba i = 1, is recovered when (M, ) = (v, 0).",

Two models are defined: one in which all signal processes are scaled according to these two \u03ba V and \u03ba F parameters, and one in which separate \u03ba f V and \u03ba f F parameters are defined for each of the five decay processes. The best fit points and the 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 CL regions in the \u03ba V -\u03ba F plane for both models are shown in Fig. 17, and the results are summarized in Table 10. For large values of \u03ba ZZ F the likelihood becomes essentially flat, resulting in the best fit point for this parameter being beyond the scale of the axis shown. The 1D 68% CL region for \u03ba ZZ F can be expressed as [1.22, \u221e]. In such scenarios, the couplings to up-and down-type fermions, or to leptons and quarks, can be separately modified. In order to probe such models, parametrizations are introduced in which the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions are scaled either by separate common modifiers for up-type (\u03ba u ) and down-type (\u03ba d ) fermions or by separate common modifiers for quarks \u03ba q and leptons \u03ba l (l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ). Figure 18 shows the results of the fits where the ratio of the couplings to up-and down-type fermions \u03bb du = \u03ba d /\u03ba u is determined along with the ratio \u03bb Vu = \u03ba V /\u03ba u and \u03ba uu =   u /\u0393 H .

The results of these two parametrizations are summarized in Table 11. Table 12 shows a summary of the compatibility of the different models considered, as described in Sects. 7 and 8, with the SM predictions. For each model, the value of q at the values of the POIs for the SM expectation (q SM ) is converted to a p-value with respect to the SM. This is done assuming q is distributed according to a \u03c7 2 function with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of POIs. This p-value is found to be greater than 5% for all parametrizations.",

Only models with CP conservation and a discrete Z 2 symmetry to prevent tree-level flavor changing neutral currents are considered. Under these assumptions, four 2HDM types are possible, referred to as Types I, II, III, and IV. Each of these 2HDMs contain seven free parameters. Under the additional assumption that the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV   is the lightest CP-even, neutral Higgs boson in the extended Higgs sector, the predicted rates for its production and decay are sensitive at leading order to only two 2HDM parameters: the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 that diagonalize the mass-squared matrices of the scalars and pseudoscalars. These two parameters are conventionally substituted by cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) and tan \u03b2, without loss of generality. In all of the 2HDMs, the coupling of the Higgs boson to vector bosons is modified by a factor sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1). The 2HDM types differ in how the fermions couple to the Higgs doublets. In the Type I model, all fermions couple to just one of the Higgs doublets. In Type II, the uptype fermions couple to one of the Higgs doublets, while the down-type fermions and the right-handed leptons couple to the second. In Type III 2HDM, also referred to as \"leptonspecific\", the quarks couple to one of the Higgs doublets and the right-handed leptons couple to the other. In the Type ",

The hMSSM scenario [123,124], in particular, is an effective MSSM model, trading the precise knowledge of m H against unknown higher-order corrections such that m H = 125.09 GeV across the m A , tan \u03b2 parameter space. Another requirement of the scenario is that H be identified as the lightest of the two neutral scalar Higgs bosons. Furthermore, one also obtains relatively simple relations between m A , tan \u03b2, and the Higgs boson coupling modifiers [125], which are shown in Table 13 and completed by Eqs. (8) and (9).

The combined signal yield relative to the SM prediction has been measured as 1.17 \u00b1 0.10 at m H = 125.09 GeV. An improvement in the measured precision of the gluon fusion production rate of around \u223c50% is achieved compared to previous ATLAS and CMS measurements. Additionally, a set of fiducial Higgs boson cross sections, in the context of the simplified template cross section framework, is presented for the first time from a combination of six decay channels. Furthermore, interpretations are provided in the context of a leading-order coupling modifier framework, including variants for which effective couplings to the photon and gluon are introduced. All of the results presented are compatible with the SM prediction. The invisible (undetected) branching fraction of the Higgs boson is constrained to be less than 22 (38%) at 95% Confidence Level. The results are additionally interpreted in two BSM models, the minimal supersymmetric model and the generic two Higgs doublet model. The constraints placed on the parameter spaces of these models are complementary to those that can be obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs bosons. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
