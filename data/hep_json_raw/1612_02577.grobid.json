Data from pp collisions at the LHC were collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The angle \u03b8 * between the b-quark from the top quark decay and a direct W boson decay product in the W boson rest frame is sensitive to the W boson polarisation. Two different W decay products are used as polarisation analysers: the charged lepton and the down-type quark for the leptonically and hadronically decaying W boson, respectively. The most precise measurement of the W boson polarisation via the distribution of cos \u03b8 * is obtained using the leptonic analyser and events in which at least two of the jets are tagged as b-quark jets. The fitted fractions of longitudinal, left-and right-handed polarisation states are F 0 = 0.709 \u00b1 0.019, F L = 0.299 \u00b1 0.015 and F R = \u2212 0.008 \u00b1 0.014, and are the most precisely measured W boson polarisation fractions to date. Limits on anomalous couplings of the W tb vertex are set.",

In the Standard Model (SM) this interaction has a (V \u2212 A) structure, where V and A refer to the vector and axial vector components of the weak coupling. The W boson, which is produced as a real particle in the decay of top quarks, possesses a polarisation which can be left-handed, right-handed or longitudinal.

Such analysers are W boson decay products whose angular distribution is sensitive to the W polarisation and determined by the W tb vertex structure. In case of a leptonic decay of the W boson (W \u2192 \u03bd), the charged lepton serves as an ideal analyser: its reconstruction efficiency is very high and the sensitivity of its angular distribution to the W boson polarisation is maximal due to its weak isospin component T 3 = \u2212 1 2 . If the W boson decays hadronically (W \u2192 qq ), the downtype quark is used, as it carries the same weak isospin as the charged lepton. This provides it with the same analysing power as the charged lepton, which is only degraded by the lower reconstruction efficiency and resolution of jets compared to charged leptons. The reconstruction of the downtype quark is in particular difficult as the two decay products of a hadronically decaying W boson are experimentally hard to separate. In the W boson rest frame, the differential crosssection of the analyser follows the distribution 1 \u03c3 d\u03c3 d cos \u03b8 * = 3 4 1 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8 * F 0",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. Its bending power ranges from 2.0 to 7.5 T m. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A three-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz.

Separate samples for W/Z +light-jets, W/Zbb+jets, W/Zcc+jets and W c+jets were generated. A parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [47] is employed to avoid double-counting of jets generated from the matrix element and the parton shower. Overlap between the W/Z QQ (Q = b, c) events generated at the matrix element level and those generated by the parton shower evolution of the W/Z +light-jets sample are removed with an angular separation algorithm. If the angular distance R between the heavy-quark pair is larger than 0.4, the matrix element prediction is used instead of the par-ton shower prediction. Event yields from the Z +jets background are normalised using their inclusive NNLO theoretical cross-sections [48]. The predictions of normalisation and flavour composition of the W +jets background are affected by large uncertainties. Hence, a data-driven technique is used to determine both the inclusive normalisation and the heavy-flavour fractions of this process. The approach followed exploits the fact that the W \u00b1 boson production is charge-asymmetric at a pp collider. Multijet events can contain jets misidentified as leptons or non-prompt leptons from hadron decays and hence satisfy the selection criteria of the lepton+jets topology. This source of background events is referred to as fake-lepton background and is estimated using a data-driven approach (\"matrix method\") which is based on the measurement of lepton selection efficiencies using different identification and isolation criteria [52].",

For this, a kinematic likelihood fitter (KLFitter) [63] is utilised. It maps the four model partons (two b-quarks and the qq pair from a W boson decay) to four reconstructed jets. The numbers of jets used as input for KLFitter can be larger than four. The two jets with the largest output of the b-tagging algorithm together with two (three) remaining jets with the highest p T were chosen as KLFitter input as this selection leads to the highest reconstruction efficiency for events with four (at least five) jets. For each of the 4! = 24 (5! = 120 for events with at least five jets) possible jet-to-parton permutations, it maximises a likelihood, L , that incorporates Breit-Wigner distributions for the W boson and top quark masses as well as transfer functions mapping the reconstructed jet and lepton energies to parton level or true lepton level, respectively. The expression for the likelihood is given by x/y \u03bd ). Individual transfer functions for electrons, muons, b-jets, light jets (including c-jets) and missing transverse momentum are used. These transfer functions are obtained from tt events simulated with MC@NLO. The top quark decay products are uniquely matched to reconstructed objects to obtain a continuous function describing the relative energy difference between parton and reconstructed level as a function of the parton-level energy. Individual parameterisations are derived for different regions of |\u03b7|. The measurement of the W boson polarisation in the lep-ton+jets channel is performed for both the top and the anti-top quarks in each event. The anti-down-type quark from the top quark decay (down-type quark from the anti-top quark decay) is used as the hadronic analyser and the charged lepton from the decay of the anti-top quark (charged anti-lepton from the top quark decay) as the leptonic analyser.",

This is achieved by multiplying the likelihood by probability distributions of the b-tagging algorithm output as a function of the transverse momentum of the jets. These probability distributions are obtained from MC@NLO for b-quark jets as well as u/c-and d/s-quark jets. Since the W boson decays into a pair of charm and strange quarks in 50% of decays into hadrons, the higher values of the b-tagging algorithm output for the charm quark allows for a separation of the two. This increases the fraction of events with correct matching of the two jets originating from a W boson decay to the corresponding up-and down-quark type jet to 60%, compared to 50% for the case of no separation power. The extended likelihood is normalised with respect to the sum of the extended likelihoods for all 120 (24) permutations and this quantity is called the \"event probability\".

A data set corresponding to 20.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment, is analysed. Events are required to include one isolated electron or muon and at least four jets, with at least one of them tagged as a b-jet. Events are recon-structed using a kinematic likelihood fit based on mass constraints for the top quarks and W bosons. It utilises the weight of the b-jet tagging algorithm to further separate the up-and down-type quarks from the hadronically decaying W bosons. The fractions for left-handed, right-handed and longitudinally polarised W bosons are found to be F 0 = 0.709 \u00b1 0.012 (stat.+bkg. norm.) \u00b1 0.015 (syst.), F L = 0.299 \u00b1 0.008 (stat.+bkg. norm.) \u00b1 0.013 (syst.) and F R = \u22120.008 \u00b1 0.006 (stat.+bkg. norm.) \u00b1 0.012 (syst.). These results constitute the most precise measurement of the W helicity fractions in tt events to date and are in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions within uncertainties. Using these results, limits on anomalous couplings of the W tb vertex are set.",
