The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The event selection requires one muon and two jets where one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Several kinematic variables are then combined into a multivariate discriminator to distinguish signal from background events. A fit to the distribution of the discriminating variable yields a total cross section of 238 \u00b1 13 (stat) \u00b1 29 (syst) pb and a ratio of top quark and top antiquark production of R t-ch. = 1.81 \u00b1 0.18 (stat) \u00b1 0.15 (syst). From the total cross section the absolute value of the CKM matrix element V tb is calculated to be 1.05 \u00b1 0.07 (exp) \u00b1 0.02 (theo).

            "text": "The production of single top quarks provides a unique testing ground for the study of electroweak processes, specifically the tWb vertex, as well as the measurement of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb . The single top quark production was first detected at the Tevatron [1,2] and was studied at higher energies [3][4][5][6] at the CERN LHC [7]. At the LHC, the dominant production mechanism of single top quarks is the t-channel process. The other two processes, W-associated (tW) production and production via the s channel, amount to roughly 30% of the total single top quark production cross section at 13 TeV [8]. The t-channel production mode, presented in Fig. 1, has a very distinct signature because of the presence, within the detector acceptance, of a light quark recoiling against the top quark. The CMS collaboration has performed several measurements of this process using data collected at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV [5, 9,10]. This analysis is based on a data set obtained from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The cross section calculation of t-channel single top quark production can be performed in two different schemes [11][12][13]. In the five-flavour scheme (5FS) b quarks come from the incoming proton and the leading order (LO) diagram is a E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. 2 \u2192 2 process ( Fig. 1 left), while in the four-flavour scheme (4FS) b quarks are not present in the initial state, and the LO diagrams are 2 \u2192 3 processes (Fig. 1 right).",

The uncertainties are associated with the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainty as well as the PDF and \u03b1 S uncertainties which are calculated with the MSTW2008 68% CL NLO [17,18], CT10 NLO [19], and NNPDF2.3 [20] PDF sets. Calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [21] are expected to be different from NLO by only a few percent. Similar results are obtained at NLO as a function of the centre-of-mass energy with next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) considered [22]. In the analysis described in this letter, the separation between signal and background processes is achieved using a multivariate analysis (MVA) technique. An artificial neural network is employed to construct a single classifier, exploiting the discriminating power of several kinematic distributions. The cross section of t-channel single top quark production is determined from a fit to the distribution of this single variable. Events with an isolated muon in the final state are selected; the muon originates from the decay of the W boson from the top quark, either directly or through W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays. No attempts are made to distinguish these two cases and the signal yield is corrected for the \u03c4 decay contributions using the corresponding theoretical branching ratio.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) [23] coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 using gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum (p T ) resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [24]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [23]. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation event generators are used to create simulated signal and background samples. Signal t-channel events are generated at NLO with MadGraph_amc@nlo version 2.2.2 (MG5_amc@nlo) [25] in the 4FS. The tt and tW background processes are generated with powheg 2.0 [26][27][28][29]. The latter is simulated in the 5FS. The value of the top quark mass used in the simulated samples is m t = 172.5 GeV. For all samples pythia 8.180 [30] with tune CUETP8M1 [31] is used to simulate the parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event. Simulated event samples with W and Z bosons in association with jets are generated using MG5_amc@nlo and the FxFx merging scheme [32], where up to two additional partons are generated at the matrix-element level. The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events, generated with pythia 8.180, are used to validate the estimation of this background with a technique based on control samples in data. The default parametrization of the PDF used in all simulations is NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 [33]. All generated events undergo a full simulation of the detector response according to the implementation of the CMS detector within Geant4 [34]. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossing (pileup) are included in the simulation with the same distribution as observed in data.",

            "text": "Events with exactly one muon and at least two jets are considered in this analysis. In addition to the presence of exactly one isolated muon, the signature of t-channel single top quark production is characterized by a substantial momentum imbalance associated to at least one neutrino, a jet arising from the hadronization of a bottom quark (b jet) from the top quark decay, and a light-quark jet -often produced in the forward region. Some events also feature a second b jet, coming from the second b quark in the gluon splitting (as shown in Fig. 1 right). This second b jet is often not selected for the analysis as the p T spectrum is generally softer and broader than that of the b jet from the top quark decay. To select events for further analysis, a high-level trigger (HLT) that requires the presence of an isolated muon with p T > 20 GeV is used. From the sample of triggered events, only those with at least one primary vertex reconstructed from at least four tracks, with the longitudinal (radial) distance of less than 24 (2) cm from the centre of the detector, are considered for the analysis. Among all primary vertices in the event, the one with the largest scalar sum of p 2 T of associated particles is selected. The particle flow (PF) algorithm [35,36] is used to reconstruct and identify individual particles in the event using combined information from the various subdetectors of the CMS experiment. Muon candidates are reconstructed combining the information from both the silicon tracker and the muon spectrometer in a global fit. An identification is performed using the quality of the geometrical matching between the tracker and the muon system measurements. The transverse momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding tracks. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momenta measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zerosuppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. Using this information, the muon isolation variable, I rel , is defined as the electron isolation has a similar definition to that of the muon. Jets are reconstructed by clustering PF particle candidates using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [37] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Charged-particle candidates closer along the z axis to any vertex other than the selected primary vertex are not included. A correction to account for pileup interactions is estimated on an event-by-event basis using the jet area method described in Ref. [38], and is applied to the reconstructed jet p T . Further jet energy corrections, derived from the study of dijet events and photon plus jet events in data, are applied. Jets are required to have |\u03b7| < 4.7 and p T > 40 GeV. Once the jets have been selected according to the above criteria, they can be further categorized using a b tagging discriminator variable in order to distinguish between jets stemming from the hadronization of b quarks and those from the hadronization of light partons. The combined secondary vertex algorithm uses track-based lifetime information together with secondary vertices inside the jet to provide a MVA discriminator for b jet identification [39,40]. At the chosen working point, the efficiency of the tagging algorithm to correctly find b jets is about 45% with a rate of 0.1% for mistagging lightparton jets [39]. Events are divided into categories according to the number of selected jets and b-tagged jets. In the following, categories are labelled as \"n-jets-m-tag(s)\", referring to events with n jets, m of which are identified as b jets. The category enriched in t-channel signal events is the 2-jets-1-tag category, while the 3-jets-1-tag and 3-jets-2-tags categories are enriched in tt background events and are used to constrain the tt contribution in the final fit. The 2-jets-0-tag category provides good sensitivity for the validation of the W+jets simulation. To reject events from QCD multijet background processes, a requirement on the transverse mass of the W boson of",

The main background contributions come from tt production and the production of W bosons in association with jets. The validity of the MC simulation of these two processes is checked in data sideband regions enriched in these events. The modelling of the relevant kinematic variables for tt production can be checked in events with three jets, of which one or two are identified as stemming from b quark hadronization (3-jets-1-tag and 3-jets-2-tags), where tt events constitute by far the largest fraction of events. The 2-jets-0-tag region is enriched in W+jets events and is used to validate the modelling of the relevant variables for this background category. From these validations no indication of significant mismodelling of either tt production or the production of W bosons and jets is observed. For the third important background category, QCD multijet production, reliable simulations are not available. The contribution from QCD multijet events is therefore suppressed as much as possible by requirements in the event selection and the remaining contamination is extracted directly from data. The m W T is well suited to effectively remove events arising from QCD multijet background as the shape of the distribution is different for QCD and non-QCD processes. In addition, the transverse mass is used to determine the remaining contribution of the QCD multijet background in the signal region. For this purpose, the requirement on m W T is removed and the entire m W T distribution is fitted using a maximum likelihood fit. The resulting yield of QCD multijet events is then extrapolated to the sample with m W T > 50 GeV.",

The fit is performed using the Barlow-Beeston method [44] which correctly accounts for limitedsize simulation samples. The distributions of the MVA discriminators in the signal region (2-jets-1-tag) and the two control regions (3-jets-1-tag and 3-jets-2-tags) are fitted simultaneously.

The free parameters of the fit are the scale factor for the normalization of the single top quark production, the scale factors for the normalization of the background processes, and the ratio of single top quark to top antiquark production R t-ch. . The background scale factors are constrained by log-normal priors with an uncertainty of 10% for the top quark background, 30% for the electroweak background, and 50% for the QCD multijet background. The latter is motivated by the uncertainties in the QCD estimation from data, while the other two are determined by the uncertainty on the theoretical cross sections. The scale factors are defined as",

To determine the impact of the sources of the remaining uncertainties, pseudo-experiments are performed. Pseudo-data are drawn from the nominal samples. Fits to the discriminator distributions are performed with templates, including the variations in the shapes that correspond to systematic variations of one standard deviation. The difference between the mean values of the results from these fits, and from fits using the nominal shapes as fit templates, is taken as an estimation for the corresponding uncertainty.

The summary of the most precise CMS measurements [3,5] for the total t-channel single top quark cross section, in comparison with NLO+NNLL QCD calculations [22]. The combination of the Tevatron measurements [56] is also shown. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of this measurement with the standard model (SM) expectation and measurements of the single top quark t-channel cross section at other centre-of-mass energies.
