            "text": "This Letter presents a search for new physics manifested as anomalous triple gauge boson couplings in WW and WZ diboson production in proton-proton collisions. The search is performed using events containing a W boson that decays leptonically and a W or Z boson whose decay products are merged into a single reconstructed jet. The data, collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19 fb \u22121 . No evidence for anomalous triple gauge couplings is found and the following 95% confidence level limits are set on their values: \u03bb ([\u22120.011, 0.011]), \u03ba \u03b3 ([\u22120.044, 0.063]), and g Z 1 ([\u22120.0087, 0.024]). These limits are also translated into their effective field theory equivalents: c WWW / 2 ([\u22122.7, 2.7] TeV \u22122 ), c B / 2 ([\u221214, 17] TeV \u22122 ), and c W / 2 ([\u22122.0, 5.7] TeV \u22122 ).",

            "text": "Measurements of electroweak diboson production can be translated into measurements of gauge boson self-couplings, which are among the most fundamental aspects of the standard model (SM). At leading order (LO), only s-channel qq annihilation diagrams have a triple-boson vertex. In WW production, the WW\u03b3 and WWZ vertices contribute, while in WZ production only the WWZ vertex is present. Physics beyond the SM can modify the couplings at these vertices, leading to observable differences in the cross section and the kinematic distributions of final state particles [1]. In the search for anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs), we adopt the effective Lagrangian and LEP parametrization in Ref.",

We focus in particular on the parameters \u03bb, \u03ba \u03b3 , and g Z 1 , where the deltas represent deviations from their respective SM values (\u03bb SM = 0). We also translate these into the equivalent parameters defined in an effective field theory (EFT) approach, namely cays hadronically, giving rise to a single merged jet ( J ) in the final state. Previous searches in this channel at the LHC can be found in Refs. [4,5]. Other recent searches in the leptonic channel are described in Refs. [6,7]. The advantages of reconstructing WV pairs in the \u03bdqq decay mode over purely leptonic final states are the larger branching fractions of W and Z bosons to quarks, and in the case of two W bosons, the ability to reconstruct their transverse momenta (p T ). These advantages are partially offset by the larger backgrounds in the \u03bdqq channel, arising mainly from W+jets production. The sensitivity of WW production to the WW\u03b3 coupling and of both WW and WZ production to the WWZ coupling, especially at high boson p T , makes these processes particularly useful as a probe of aTGCs. Compared to our previous search at \u221a s = 7 TeV [4], we have added another coupling parameter, g Z 1 , to the parameter space, and we focus exclusively on the Lorentz-boosted final states, where V had is reconstructed as a single merged jet, since these final states are far more sensitive to an aTGC signal than the resolved two-jet states.",

A Geant4-based simulation [24] of the CMS detector is used in the production of all Monte Carlo (MC) samples. The simulation also includes multiple proton-proton collisions within a bunch crossing (pileup). Simulated events are reconstructed and analyzed in the same way as measured collision events, subject to additional corrections that account for differences between data and simulation in trigger and selection efficiencies, and in the vertex multiplicity distribution.",
