The WS decay can occur via mixing, where an initially pure D 0 oscillates to become a D 0 , then undergoes a Cabibbo-favored (CF) decay to K + \u03c0 \u2212 ; or it can occur via doubly-Cabbibo-suppressed (DCS) decay. The D 0 meson is reconstructed in the decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , the charge of the soft pion from D * + decay indicates the initial flavor of the D 0 meson.

When allowing for CPV, the form of Eq. 4 remains the same but has separate coefficients R \u00b1 D , x 2 \u00b1 and y 2 \u00b1 for D 0 and D 0 decays. Similarly, the mixing parameters of other WS hadronic decays can be also extracted from their time-dependent rate distribution in a similar fashion. For a multi-body decay such as D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , additional sensitivity can be gained by including the position of each event within the Dalitz plot in a time-dependent amplitude fit, since the distributions of the DCS and CF decays differ. However, one must be careful: the mixing parameter x and y measured in D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 can not be directly compared to the ones in the D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, since their strong phase differences \u03b4 D are not equal.

Many searches for time-integrated CP asymmetries have been performed by both BABAR and Belle experiments and no evidence of CPV has been seen yet.

Most recently, the BABAR experiment performed a measurement of timeintegrated CP asymmetry in the decay D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 +8 . In the decay D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + , the SM predicts A CP to be (\u22120.332 \u00b1 0.006) %, due to CPV in K 0 \u2212 K 0 mixing 9 . However, contributions from non-SM processes may reduce the value of A CP or enhance it up to the level of one percent 10,11 . A significant deviation of the A CP measurement from the SM expectation would be evidence for the presence of NP beyond the SM. Due to the smallness of the predicted value from the SM, this measurement requires high statistics and precise control of the systematic uncertainties.",

In this analysis we have developed a data-based method to determine the charge asymmetry in track reconstruction as a function of the magnitude of the track momentum and its polar angle. Since B mesons are produced in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB nearly at rest in the CM frame and decay isotropically in the B rest frame, these events provide a high statistics control sample essentially free of any physics-induced charge asymmetry. However, data recorded at the \u03a5(4S) resonance also include continuum production e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c), where there is a non-negligible forwardbackward asymmetry due to the interference between the single virtual photon process and other production processes, as described above. The continuum contribution is estimated using the off-resonance data rescaled to the same luminosity as the on-resonance data sample. Subtracting the rescaled off-resonance sample from the on-resonance one, we obtain the number of reconstructed tracks corresponding to the B meson decays only.
