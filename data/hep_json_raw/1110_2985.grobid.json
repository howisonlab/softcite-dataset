The high-p T charge particle production in central Pb\u2212Pb collisions (0 \u2212 5%) is strongly suppressed by a factor \u2248 6 at transverse momenta p T = 6 \u2212 7 GeV/c as compared to expectation from independent superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. Above p T = 7 GeV/c there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification factor, which reaches R AA \u2248 0.4 at p T = 50 GeV/c. The measured suppression of high-p T particles is stronger than that measured at RHIC.",

The measurement is motivated by results [2,3,4,5] from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which showed that hadron production at large transverse momentum in central Au\u2212Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200 GeV is suppressed by a factor 4\u22125 compared to expectations from an independent superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. This observation is typically expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor which is defined as the ratio of the charged particle yield in Pb\u2212Pb to that in pp (pp reference), scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions N coll",

The p T spectrum flattens with higher pp collision energy. Due to the limited statistics of the \u221a s = 2.76 TeV data set the pp reference for R AA was constructed using the measured yield only below p T = 5 GeV/c, as indicated in Fig. 1 (right panel). At larger p T the pp reference was approximated by a modified Hagedorn function. This functional form provides the best fit to the measured pp spectrum between p T = 5 and 30 GeV/c and was extrapolated to p T = 50 GeV/c. The estimated uncertainty on the pp reference due to the parametrization and extrapolation procedure increases with p T and reaches 25% at p T = 50 GeV/c. intervals. In the most peripheral collisions the shape of the p T distribution is similar to pp. In contrast, a marked depletion of the spectra is developing gradually as centrality is increasing, indicating a significant suppression of particle production in central collisions.

The position and shape of the maximum at p T \u2248 2 GeV/c and the subsequent decrease are similar at RHIC and LHC. At p T = 6-7 GeV/c R AA is smaller than at RHIC indicating that a very dense medium is formed in Pb\u2212Pb collisions at the LHC.",

At all centralities, a pronounced minimum at about p T = 6 \u2212 7 GeV/c is observed. For p T > 7 GeV/c there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification factor until p T = 30 GeV/c. This emphasizes the strong relation between the medium density and partonic energy loss. Fig. 3 (right panel) shows a comparison of R AA in central Pb\u2212Pb collisions (0\u22125%) at \u221a s N N =2.76 TeV to calculations from energy loss models [10,11,12,13]. All model calculations have been constrained to match R AA results from RHIC. The qualitative features of our data are described by all models, including the strong rise of R AA below p T = 30 GeV/c and the flattening off at higher p T . A more quantitative comparison of model calculations to the present data will help to put tighter constraints on the underlying energy loss mechanisms. \u2021 After the conference presentation, we found small inconsistencies in the tracking, leading to an overestimation of the R AA at high transverse momenta. The analysis was reviewed, and here we present the updated result in the transverse momentum range p T < 50 GeV/c, where the updated values remain within the systematic uncertainties of the ones shown at the conference.
