In this writeup, I present two IceCube analyses of neutrino interactions at energies far above 1 TeV. The first measures neutrino absorption in the Earth, and, from that determines the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at energies between 6.3 and 980 TeV. We find that the cross-sections are 1.30 +0.21   \u22120.19 (stat.) +0.39 \u22120.43 (syst.) times the Standard Model crosssection. We also present a measurement of neutrino inelasticity, using \u03bd \u00b5 charged-current interactions that occur within IceCube. We have measured the average inelasticity at energies from 1 TeV to above 100 TeV, and found that it is in agreement with the Standard Model expectations. We have also performed a series of fits to this track sample and a matching cascade sample, to probe aspects of the astrophysical neutrino flux, particularly the flavor ratio.",

The cross-sections for these process increase with increasing energy. As Volkova and Zatsepin [5] first pointed out, at energies above about 40 TeV, the Earth becomes opaque to neutrinos, so one can use energetic neutrinos to probe the interior of the Earth. Or, one can turn this around, assume that the Earth density profile is known, and use absorption to measure the neutrino-nucleon crosssection. For long chords through the Earth, as are studied here, the standard \"Preliminary Earth Reference Model\" [6] contributes less than a 1% systematic uncertainty to the cross-section measurement. Figure 1 shows the transmission probability, as a function of zenith angle and neutrino energy. Absorption manifests itself as a change in the zenith angle distribution with increasing neutrino energy. Beyond Standard Model (BSM) processes might also contribute to the crosssection, further increasing the rise with energy. Two phenomena that can increase the cross-section are models that involve leptoquarks [7] and those with additional, tightlyrolled-up spatial dimensions [8]. We measured the cross-section using 1 year of data from IC-79, a sample of 10,784 upward-going \u03bd \u00b5 events [9] with measured muon energy above 1 TeV [10]. These events were then binned in two dimensions, cos(\u03b8 z ) and muon energy. The resulting histogram was then fitted to a model that included the three fluxes from conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrino and astrophysical neutrinos.",

In NC interactions, the neutrinos lose energy, but are not absorbed. The fit accounted for these interactions, by treating propagation through the Earth as a twodimensional problem, with one dimension for the entering neutrino energy, and the other for its energy when it reaches IceCube. The propagation was calculated for different cross-sections, as a function of these energies and zenith angle, and the fitter interpolated between the nearest cross-sections. The absorption calculation neglected nuclear shadowing, which can reduce the per-nucleon crosssection of heavy nuclei [16]. It also neglected electromagnetic interactions, whereby the neutrino fluctuates to a \u00b5 and a W \u00b1 , with the \u00b5 then interacting with the Coulomb field of the target nucleus. Overall, these should both be less than 10% effects.",

We isolated the statistical uncertainty by fixing the nuisance parameters to their preferred values and rerunning the fit. We then determined the systematic uncertainties associated with the fit by subtracting, in quadrature, the statistical uncertainty from the total fit uncertainty. The total systematic uncertainty includes some contributions from factors which were not included in the fit: uncertainties about the optical properties of the ice ( +0.30 \u22120.38 ), uncertainties in the density distribution of the Earth (\u00b10.01), latitude-dependent variations in production rate due to temperature ( +0.00 \u22120.04 ), uncertainties in the angular acceptance of the IceCube DOMs ( +0.04 \u22120.00 ) and finally uncertainties in the spectral indices of the prompt and astrophysical spectral indices. The latter were already included in the fit; this additional uncertainty was included to account for the tension between the spectral indices observed by contained event studies [17] and those from through-going muons [18]. We then found the total systematic uncertainty by adding these factors, in quadrature to the systematic error associated with the fit.
