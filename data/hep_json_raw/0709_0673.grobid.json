These limits greatly extend the excluded region to higher masses than has been possible in previous searches.",

            "text": "The existence of three distinct generations of fermions and the hierarchy of their masses motivates the possibility of a new scale of matter yet unobserved. An unambiguous signature for a new scale of matter would be the direct observation of excited states of fermions (f * ), via their decay into a gauge boson and a fermion. Effective models describing the interaction of excited fermions with standard matter have been proposed [1,2,3]. In the models [1,2] the interaction of an f * with a gauge boson is described by a magnetic coupling proportional to 1/\u039b where \u039b is a new scale. Proportionality constants f , f \u2032 and f s result in different couplings to U (1), SU (2) and SU (3) gauge bosons. Electron (or positron) and proton collisions at very high energies provide an excellent environment to look for excited states of first generation fermions. In particular, these excited neutrinos (\u03bd * ) and electrons (e * ) could be singly produced through t-channel W or \u03b3/Z boson exchange, respectively.",

Backgrounds arise from charged current (CC) events with an isolated \u03c0 0 or initial or final state radiation. The presence of a neutrino is inferred by requiring P miss T > 15 GeV. A photon is tagged by identifying an electromagnetic cluster with P \u03b3 T > 20 GeV. No well measured track should point to the electromagnetic cluster. Radiative CC events are suppressed by requiring that the four-momentum transfer squared determined from the electromagnetic cluster be log(Q 2 \u03b3 ) > 3.5 GeV 2 . For the \u03bdZ \u0592\u2192qq resonance search, the dominant SM background consists of multi-jet CC events with a moderate contribution from photoproduction. The presence of a neutrino is inferred from substantial missing momentum P miss T > 20 GeV. We use a subsample of events with at least two jets, each having a transverse momentum larger than 20 and 15 GeV, respectively, and a polar angle between 5 \u2022 and 130 \u2022 . At low P miss T , cuts on the variable i E i \u2212 P i z , where the sum runs over all visible particles, and on the ratio V ap /V p of transverse energy flow anti-parallel and parallel to the hadronic final state [4] are used to suppress CC and photoproduction events. The Z candidate is reconstructed from the combination of two jets with an invariant mass closest to the nominal Z boson mass. In the eW \u0592\u2192qq channel, multi-jet neutral current (NC) events constitute the main contribution from SM processes. Events are selected by the presence of an electron in the LAr with Q 2 e > 2500 GeV 2 or a tranverse momentum P e T greater than 25 GeV. The restriction on the electron polar angle to the forward region of the LAr (5 \u2022 < \u03b8 e < 90 \u2022 ) removes a large part of the NC DIS contribution. The presence of at least two high P T jets with P jet1, jet2 T > 20, 15 GeV and 5 \u2022 < \u03b8 jet1, jet2 < 130 \u2022 is required. A W candidate is then reconstructed in those events from the combinaison of two jets with an invariant mass closest to the nominal W boson mass.",
