They found evidence in the same decay mode for another resonance, labeled as the X(4270) [5]. Recently, the LHCb experiment studied the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + in pp collisions at 7 TeV, with a data sample more than three times larger than that of CDF, and set an upper limit (UL) incompatible with the CDF result [6]. The D0 and the CMS experiments more recently made studies of the same decay channel, leading to different conclusions [7,8] than the LHCb experiment. In this work we study the rare decays B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K + , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K 0 S and search for possible resonant states in the J/\u03c8\u03c6 mass spectrum. We also search for the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6, which is expected to proceed mainly via a Cabibbo-suppressed and color-suppressed transitionbd \u2192ccdd. The absence of a signal would indicate that the required rescattering ofdd intoss is very small.",

The integrated luminosity for this analysis is 422.5 fb \u22121 , which corresponds to the production of 469 million BB pairs [9]. The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [10]. We mention here only the components of the detector that are used in the present analysis. Charged particles are detected and their momenta measured with a combination of a cylindrical drift chamber (DCH) and a silicon vertex tracker (SVT), both operating within the 1.5 T magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. Information from a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (DIRC) is combined with specific ionization measurements from the SVT and DCH to identify charged kaon and pion candidates. The efficiency for kaon identification is 90% while the rate for a pion being misidentified as a kaon is 2%. For low transverse momentum kaon candidates that do not reach the DIRC, particle identification relies only on the energy loss measurement, so that the transverse momentum spectrum of identified kaons extends down to 150 MeV/c. Electrons are identified using information provided by a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), in combination with that from the SVT and DCH, while muons are identified in the Instrumented Flux Return (IFR). This is the outermost subdetector, in which muon/pion discrimination is performed. Photons are detected, and their energies measured with the EMC.",

For each channel we perform full detector simulations where B mesons decay uniformly over the available phase space (PHSP). These simulated events are then reconstructed and analyzed as are the real data. These MC simulations are also used to validate the analysis procedure and the BF extractions. Table I reports the resulting integrated efficiencies for the different channels, and the efficiency-corrected yields. The efficiency is computed in two different ways. For B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K 0 S we make use of a Dalitz-plot-dependent efficiency, where each event is weighted by the inverse of the efficiency evaluated in the appropriate cell of the Dalitz plot shown in Fig. 4. This approach is particularly important because of the lower efficiency observed at low J/\u03c8\u03c6 invariant mass, where the spectrum deviates from pure PHSP behavior. For the \u03c6 channels, the \"Corrected yield\" values in Table  I are obtained as sums of inverse Dalitz-plot efficiencies for events in the \u03c6 signal regions with backgroundsubtraction taken into account as described in Sec. IV. The events in the \u03c6 signal region account for about 65% of the data in the four-body final states. There is no evidence of structure in the remaining \u223c35% of these events, and so they are corrected according to their average efficiency obtained from MC simulation of four-body PHSP samples. For these channels, B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K 0 S , the PHSP corrected yield is added to the \u03c6 signal region corrected yield to obtain the \"Corrected yield\" values in lines 1 and 3 of Table I.

The evaluation of the integrated luminosity is performed using the method of BB counting [10], and we assign a uniform 0.6% uncertainty to all the final states. The uncertainty on the efficiency evaluation related to the size of the MC simulations is negligible with respect to the other contributions. The systematic uncertainty on the reconstruction efficiency of charged-particle tracks is estimated from the comparison of data samples and full detector simulations for well-chosen decay modes. In a similar way we obtain a 1.7% systematic uncertainty in the reconstruction of K 0 S meson decays. In the case of the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6K 0 S and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6K + decay modes, since the J/\u03c8 and the \u03c6 are vector states, we compute the efficiency also under the assumption that the two vector mesons are transversely or longitudinally polarized. We consider the uncertainties related to the choice of the probability density functions (pdf) in the fit procedure, by varying fixed parameters by \u00b11\u03c3 in their uncertainties. We also evaluate the efficiency variations for different charged-particle-track PID. All uncertainties are added in quadrature. We note that the BF for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + and that for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K 0 are in agreement with their previous BABAR measurements [14], which already dominate the PDG average values [11], but now we obtain more than four times better precision. The combination of these decay modes was observed first by the CLEO Collaboration [15]. Our BF value for the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K + is the first measurement. For the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K + K \u2212 K 0 , the LHCb Collaboration has obtained a BF value (2.02\u00b10.43\u00b10.17\u00b10.08)\u00d710 \u22125 [16], which is consistent with our result.",

We estimate the background contributions from the \u2206E sidebands, find them to be small and consistent with a PHSP behavior, and so in the fits they are incorporated into the non-resonant PHSP term. The decay of a pseudoscalar meson to two vector states may contain high spin contributions which could generate non-uniform angular distributions. However, due to the limited data sample we do not include such angular terms, and assume that the resonances decay isotropically.

The background contributions, estimated from the \u2206E sidebands in the range 40 < |\u2206E| < 70 MeV, are shown as shaded histograms in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) and are seen to be small. In the following we have ignored the presence of possible additional S-wave contributions in the \u03c6(1020) signal region.We select the \u03c6(1020) signal region to be in the mass range [1.004\u22121.034] GeV/c 2 .Figure 2shows the m ES distribution for (c) B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K + and (d) B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6K 0 S candidates, respectively, for events in the \u03c6 mass region, which satisfy the \u2206E selection criteria.Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show the \u2206E distribution for m ES > 5.27 GeV/c 2 , when requiring the K + K \u2212 invariant mass to be in the \u03c6(1020) signal region. The distributions of Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 2(e) contain 212 events in the m ES and \u2206E signal region, with an estimated background of 23 events. Similarly, those of Fig. 2(d) and Fig. 2(f) contain 50 events, with an estimated background of 9 events.We search for the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 by constraining a fitted J/\u03c8 and two loosely identified kaon candidates to a common vertex. Possible backgrounds originating from the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 * (892), K 0 * (892) \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and from the channel B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 1 (1270), K 1 (1270) \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 are found consistent with zero, after applying a dedicated selection as described in Sec. II and Sec. III.Figure 3shows the corresponding m ES and \u2206E distributions. We do not observe a significant signal for this decay mode.ForFigs. 1-3an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to each m ES distribution is performed to determine the yield",
