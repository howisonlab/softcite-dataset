This means that they maintain their identity throughout the full evolution of the collision, thereby serving as a tagged probe.",

The width of the peak, which for D 0 and D + varies between \u223c6 and \u223c20 MeV/c 2 , is well reproduced by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

The analysed data corresponded to an integrated luminosity of 5 nb \u22121 . This measurement was made at mid-rapidity, in the region 1 < p T < 24 GeV/c. The differential cross sections were reported in [4], and the result for D * + production is shown in figure 1. The measured cross sections are described within uncertainties by FONLL [3] and GM-VFNS [5] pQCD calculations, with the experimental results matching the upper end of the uncertainty bands in the FONLL calculations. Further measurements were also taken for pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV, which was the centre-of-mass energy used for Pb-Pb collisions. These results were reported in [7]. Since the statistics collected at this energy were fewer than those recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV, these were not used as the pp reference for the Pb-Pb results, instead being used mainly to verify the validity of an energy scaling of the 7 TeV results to \u221a s = 2.76 TeV using FONLL [8]. In addition, the results for 7 TeV and 2.76 TeV pp collisions were extrapolated to full phase space using FONLL calculations, in order to extract the total cc cross section in pp at these energies. The results of these extrapolations are shown in figure 2, alongside results from other experiments and next-to-leading-order pQCD calculations using the MNR framework [6]. The result at 7 TeV is in agreement with those from the ATLAS and LHCb collaborations, and both of the ALICE points follow the trends exhibited by both the NLO predictions and other experimental results spanning three orders of magnitude in energy. One thing to note here is that all of the results lie within the upper part of the uncertainty band of the predictions; this is possibly due to the central calculation overestimating the bare charm quark mass (m c = 1.5 GeV/c 2 ).",

At present, the uncertainties are too large to conclude whether or not there is a lower level of suppression for D + s at low to intermediate p T in comparison with the other D mesons. Such lifting of the strangeness suppression in Pb-Pb compared to pp is theorised to possibly happen due to charm recombination in the medium [20,21].",

The preliminary results for D 0 at low p T are shown in figure 5, and at higher p T for all three species in figure 6. From these it can be seen that the centrality-dependent behaviour of the R AA varies largely with p T at low momenta, eventually stabilising at higher p T . In addition, there is no significant difference in the centrality dependence of the suppression between the three D-meson species.   This result was also compared with that for non-prompt J/\u03c8 mesons (i.e. J/\u03c8 particles from the decay of B mesons) measured by the CMS collaboration [22]. It should be noted that the CMS measurements were taken in different rapidity regions to the ALICE results. For direct comparisons to be made, the D-meson p T intervals were chosen such that they represented similar kinematic regions, using kinematic simulations of B \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X. These comparisons are shown in figure 7. The results indicate that there is a greater level of suppression for charm quarks than for beauty, as expected from the predicted mass dependence discussed in section 1.",

This comparison is shown in figure 10. It can be seen that, within uncertainties, the experimental results do not favour one prediction over the other. Finally, in figure 10, we also compare the average R pPb with the average R AA measured for D mesons, which was discussed in section 4. We find that, although the centre-of-mass energies of the two systems differ, there is a clear suppression in Pb-Pb collisions compared with p-Pb for p T > 4 GeV/c. This indicates that final-state effects such as partonic energy loss in the medium have a far more dominant role in the suppression of D-meson production at higher p T than initial-state effects such as nuclear shadowing.",

This suppression can be understood as an indication of in-medium parton energy loss. Further study will be required before conclusions can be drawn as to whether there is an enhancement of the D + s yield relative to non-strange D mesons at low p T . In addition, as expected due to the dead-cone effect, the R AA of D mesons was found to be lower than that of B mesons in the range 5 < p T < 16 GeV/c. Finally, a significantly non-zero v 2 for D mesons was measured at low p T , suggesting that charm quarks take part in the collective motion of the medium. The results from p-Pb collisions show the R pPb to be consistent with unity, as well as being compatible with models of initial-state effects.
