The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC. A signal would appear as a resonant contribution to the invariant mass spectrum of the \u03b3 + jet system, above the background expected from standard model processes. No resonant excess is found, and upper limits are set on the product of the excited quark cross section and its branching fraction as a function of its mass. These are the most stringent limits to date in the \u03b3 + jet final state, and exclude excited light quarks with masses below 5.5 TeV and excited b quarks with masses below 1.8 TeV, assuming standard model like coupling strengths.",

Searches have been performed in different channels [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12], but no evidence for the existence of excited quarks has yet been found. This analysis looks for evidence of qg \u2192 q \u2192 q\u03b3 (where q represents u or d) and bg \u2192 b \u2192 b\u03b3 production by searching for resonances in \u03b3 + jet final states. The signal model includes excited quarks with spin-1 2 , and assumes a compositeness scale that equals the mass of the resonance (m Res ). An assumption is also made that f s , f , and f have identical values [3,4] and henceforth these will be referred to collectively as f . The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, in 2016. a very small fraction of the background due to its small production cross section. This Letter provides a brief description of the CMS detector in Section 2. The main strategy used in selecting the events is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 contains information about signal and background models, while Section 5 lists the systematic uncertainties estimated in this analysis. The results of the study are presented in Section 6 and summarized in Section 7.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The very forward regions of the detector near the beam line is covered by the forward calorimeters. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of about 1.3% up to pseudorapidity |\u03b7| = 1 rising to about 2.5% at |\u03b7| = 1.4 [13], where \u03b7 is defined as \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], \u03b8 being the polar angle of the cylindrical coordinates of the CMS detector. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3-4%. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution is typically around 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in [14].",

The generated events are processed through a full CMS detector simulation based on Geant4 [23]. The simulation uses the CUETP8M1 underlying event tune [24,25], a renormalization and factorization scale corresponding to \u03bc = p T for the hard-scattered partons, and NNPDF2.3LO parton distribution functions (PDFs) [26]. The MadGraph5_amc@nlo v2.2.2 program [27] has been used to generate the \u03b3 + jet and W/Z + \u03b3 background MC samples at LO, with the showering and hadronization carried out by the pythia 8.212 program. A double counting of the partons generated with MadGraph and those with pythia is removed using the MLM [28] matching scheme. The multijet MC events are generated using pythia 8.212 event generator. The same event reconstruction is employed in data and MC simulations. However, the background is evaluated from data, and the MC simulation is used only for the optimization of the event selection. The invariant mass distribution of the SM \u03b3 + jet background falls smoothly and can be described by an analytic function. The inclusive invariant mass distribution and the distributions for 1b tag and 0b tag categories, expressed in TeV, are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The binning is chosen to have a bin width approximately equal to the expected \u03b3 + jet mass resolution, which varies from about 4.5% at a mass of 1 TeV to 3.3% at 6 TeV. These distributions are modeled using an empirical parametrization that has been used widely in similar previous searches [7,8,10,11]:",

The highest invariant mass event observed in data has m \u03b3 +jet of 4.6 TeV with a b-tagged jet, and thus belongs to both the inclusive and 1b tag categories. In order to examine the presence of a possible systematic bias due to the choice of background fitting function, tests are performed using alternate functional forms. These alternative expressions are polynomial functions that also provide adequate descriptions of the data. To perform these tests, an invariant mass distribution of the SM background is obtained from MC simulation. This invariant mass distribution is fitted with alternate test functions and the results of the fit, considered as the truth model, are used to generate a large number of pseudo-data samples that have bin-to-bin statistical fluctuations similar to those of the data.

The deviation from zero, of the mean in the pull distribution, is a measure of the bias present in the model. The pull distributions for q and b modeling over the studied mass range are found to be consistent with normalized Gaussian forms with medians deviating by no more than 0.5 from zero, and widths consistent with unity for the full mass range. When added in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty, the bias uncertainty is found to contribute approximately 10% of the total.

The results are presented in terms of limits on the product of the cross section (\u03c3 ) and branching fraction (B). The cross section upper limits are compared to the LO theoretical predictions, for all the three couplings, to estimate the lower mass limit on excited quarks. In Figs. 4 and 5, the experimental limits for f = 1.0 are shown for q and b , respectively, with the theoretical predictions for the different couplings overlaid. There is a small dependence of \u03c3 \u00d7 B on f , of the order of 10%-20%, which is taken into account correctly when extracting the mass limits. Observed lower bounds of  shown for q and b in Fig. 6. This result can also be interpreted in terms of the ratio of the resonance mass and , i.e., if we relax the assumption of = m Res , the excited quark production cross section is proportional to f as well as m Res / .

Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are placed on the product of production cross section and decay branching fraction for the pres-ence of q and b excited quarks in \u03b3 + jet final states. Comparing these upper limits with theoretical predictions, excited light quarks within the mass range 1.0 < m q < 5.5 TeV and excited b quarks within the mass range 1.0 < m b < 1.8 TeV are excluded at 95%confidence level, assuming standard model like coupling strengths. These are the most sensitive limits for q and b searches in the \u03b3 + jet final states. In addition, the search for excited b quarks is the first to be presented in any final state at \u221a s = 13 TeV.
