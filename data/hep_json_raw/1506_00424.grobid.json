Direct measurements of the production and decay rates of the new particle, using SM decay channels, have so far played a key role in determining whether or not it is indeed consistent with the SM predictions. However, substantially increasing the precision of these measurements will require further data. Searches for Higgs bosons through production mechanisms not predicted by the SM, or decay modes involving particles not included in the SM, provide a complementary approach and have the advantage of probing specific types of new physics models with the existing data.",

A simple realization of these models includes a new U(1) D symmetry (the subscript \"D\" stands for \"Dark\") which is broken and gives rise to massive dark photons (denoted as \u03b3 D ). Kinetic mixing of the new U(1) D with the SM hypercharge U(1) Y provides a small mixing between \u03b3 D and the SM photon which allows \u03b3 D to decay to SM particles [21]. Depending on the value \u03b5 of the kinetic mixing, the \u03b3 D may also be long-lived.

Funded by SCOAP 3 . surements of the cosmic ray spectrum constrains the mass of \u03b3 D to be less than twice the mass of the proton [22]. If the hidden sector directly or indirectly interacts with the Higgs field, a number of possible scenarios may be realized. One such scenario, denoted in this letter as benchmark model 2, is a model of SUSY where the SM-like Higgs boson can decay via h \u2192 2n 1 , where n 1 is the lightest neutralino in the visible (as opposed to hidden) part of the SUSY spectrum. The n 1 can decay via n 1 \u2192 n D + \u03b3 D , where n D is a dark neutralino that escapes detection. Assuming that \u03b3 D can only decay to SM particles, the branching fraction B(\u03b3 D \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) can be as large as 45%, depending on the mass of \u03b3 D [11].",

However, the search has been designed to be independent of the details of these two specific models, and the results can be interpreted in the context of other models predicting the production of the same final states. Compared to the previous version [25], the present analysis has been redesigned to be sensitive to signatures with the intermediate bosons traversing a nonnegligible distance before decaying into a pair of muons. Such signatures can be realized in dark SUSY models if the mixing of the dark photon with its SM counterpart is sufficiently weak. In addition, the present analysis uses a dataset four times larger than the previous analysis, and at a higher center-of-mass energy, further extending the reach for signatures with prompt muons.",

Events are selected with a trigger that requires at least three muon candidates, two of which have a common vertex and an invariant mass consistent with that of the J/\u03c8 particle. Events are further required to contain at least four reconstructed muons with p T > 3.5 GeV, which form dimuon pairs. This control sample does not specifically require that the dimuons satisfy the requirement I sum < 2 GeV since I sum is used to separate the contribution of \"prompt\" and \"nonprompt\" (from b quark decays) J/\u03c8 in data. Finally, both dimuons are required to have an invariant mass between 2.8 and 3.3 GeV. Following these requirements the data sample consists of events containing prompt and nonprompt J/\u03c8 . To subtract the nonprompt com-ponent, two independent methods have been studied: the first one divides the control sample based on the values of the isolation variable I sum for each of the two dimuons in each event. The number of events in which both dimuons satisfy the requirement I sum < 2 GeV is extrapolated from the regions in which at least one of the dimuons fails this requirement. The second approach uses the lifetime of the J/\u03c8 candidate, calculated under the hypothesis of it being produced at the beam line, as a discriminating variable. The data distribution is fitted in the isolated region using prompt and nonprompt templates from simulation and nonisolated sideband in data, respectively. Both approaches give consistent results within the associated uncertainties and the results of the isolation-based method are used in the final analysis. There are two mechanisms for the production of prompt double J/\u03c8 events: single-and double-parton scattering (SPS and DPS, respectively), corresponding to whether the two J/\u03c8 mesons are produced from one or two independent parton interactions. The number of prompt events in the control region is further separated into SPS and DPS components using the J/\u03c8 rapidity difference as the discriminating variable. Finally, the data-to-simulation normalization factor and the fraction of SPS and DPS events are extrapolated from the control to the signal region, resulting in a final estimation for the contribution from prompt double J/\u03c8 events of 0.06 \u00b1 0.03 events.",

The scale factor per event is found to be data / sim = 0.93 \u00b1 0.07 and it accounts for the differences in the efficiency of the trigger, the efficiency of the muon reconstruction and identification for each of the four muon candidates, and the combined efficiency of the isolation requirement for the two dimuon candidates. The estimate accounts for correlations associated with the presence of multiple muons per event. The main systematic uncertainty is the offline muon reconstruction (4.1%), which includes an uncertainty (1% per muon) to cover variations of the scale factor as a function of the muon p T and \u03b7. Other systematic uncertainties include: the uncertainty in dimuon reconstruction effects related to overlaps of muon trajectories in the tracker and in the muon system (3.5%), the trigger efficiency (1.5%), the uncertainty in the efficiency caused by the modeling of the tails in the dimuon invariant mass distribution that arises from the requirement that the two dimuon masses are compatible (1.5%), and the dimuon isolation (negligible). The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity of the data sample (2.6%) [69] is also included. All uncertainties quoted above are related to variations in the signal efficiency due to experimental selection and sum up to 6.3%. The uncertainties related to variations in the signal acceptance due to the model include: the uncertainties related to the PDFs and the knowledge of the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s , which are estimated by comparing the PDFs in CTEQ6.6 [63] with those in NNPDF2.0 [70] and MSTW2008 [71], following the PDF4LHC recommendations [72,73]. Using the analysis benchmark samples, they are found to be 3% for the signal acceptance. The variation of the renormalization and factorization scales has a negligible effect. In addition a re-weighting procedure is applied to the Higgs boson p T spectra in the benchmark signal samples to reproduce the NNLO+NNLL prediction [74] and account for possible changes to the analysis acceptance. Only a weak sensitivity to this is expected and the result of the re-weighting procedure is limited by the statistical uncertainty of the simulated samples (2%), which is therefore included as a conservative systematic uncertainty on this effect. Thus, the total systematic uncertainty in the signal acceptance and selection efficiency is 7.3%.",

An exact interpretation of these results requires evaluating the experimental acceptance using the generator-level acceptance for each of the two h 1,2 bosons, and then using the measured upper limit on the sum of two contributions to derive limits for any choice of NMSSM model parameters. To present results in a fashion allowing for straightforward interpretation, we note that if one of the two CP-even Higgs bosons is the 125 GeV state observed at the LHC, then the other one is either lighter or heavier. In the NMSSM it is typical that one of the two has approximately the SM production cross section and a small B(h i \u2192 2a), whereas the other one has a suppressed production rate and large B(h i \u2192 2a) due to its large singlet fraction. In Fig. 2 (left) the limit at each mass point is calculated taking the CP-even Higgs boson with the corresponding mass as the only source of signal events; the curve below 125 GeV applies to NMSSM models in which m h 1 < m h 2 = 125 GeV, with h 1 decays dominating the rate of 4\u03bc events. The limit at m h = 125 GeV corresponds to the case where 125 GeV = m h 1 < m h 2 , with h 1 decays still responsible for the vast majority of signal-like events. The points above 125 GeV correspond to model points for which only h 2 (m h 2 > m h 1 = 125 GeV) is allowed to have a sizeable rate of observable 4\u03bc events. Finally, for models with m h 2 > 150 GeV, the limit at 150 GeV can be used as a conservative estimate of the production rate limit. In each of these scenarios it is possible that the other Higgs boson also contributes some fraction of the 4\u03bc signal events, in which case the limit shown is more conservative than would be given by an exact evaluation.",

The B 17 shape is measured using a data sample enriched with bb events containing exactly one dimuon and one additional muon, under the assumption that the decay of one of the b quarks results in a dimuon pair containing at least one muon with p T > 17 GeV and |\u03b7| < 0.9, while the other b quark decays semileptonically resulting in the",

The two templates are required as the shape of the dimuon invariant mass distribution depends on the p T thresholds used to select the muons and whether the muons are restricted to the central (|\u03b7| < 0.9) region or can be in the full acceptance range (|\u03b7| < 2.4), as a result of the differences",
