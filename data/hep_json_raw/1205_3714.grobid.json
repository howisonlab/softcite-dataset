Recent theoretical improvements provide predictions of the three-jet rate in e + e \u2212 -annihilation at next-to-next-to-leading order. In this paper a measurement of the three-jet rate is used to determine the strong coupling \u03b1 S from a comparison to next-to-next-to-leading order predictions matched with next-to-leading logarithmic approximations and yields a value for the strong coupling \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1199 \u00b1 0.0010(stat) \u00b1 0.0021(exp) \u00b1 0.0054(had) \u00b1 0.0007(theo), consistent with the world average.",

Besides using a different energy range we perform a fit in a range of the three-jet resolution parameter. We present a matching scheme to combine NNLO predictions together with next-to-leading logarithm approximations (NLLA). The matched predictions are used to determine the strong coupling \u03b1 S .

For instance, (\u03b1 S ) ln 2 (0.01) \u2248 O(1). Thus, one has to perform the allorder resummation of the leading and NLLA contributions. This resummation is possible for the Durham algorithm using the coherent branching formalism [12,16]. Matched NLO + NLLA predictions for jet rates have been compared to ALEPH data and good agreement was found, see Fig. 2 of [17]. There an improved resummation formula was used, where part of the subleading logarithms, that can be controlled systematically by including the 'K-term' [18][19][20], are also taken into account (NNLO + NLLA + K). In this paper we use the same resummation formula and extend the matching to the NNLO accuracy, which requires the expansion of the improved resummation formula up to O(\u03b1 3 S ). In the resummed prediction we use the one-loop formula for the running coupling. One could also use higher-loop running, but the difference would be in the coefficients of the subleading logarithms (NNLL and higher), which are not controlled systematically in the resummed prediction and therefore are neglected. Expanding the resummation formula in [12], we find",

The corrections applied to the data (see Sect. 3.4) reverting the imperfectness of detector and the correction of the QCD-predictions due to hadronisation effects are required to be small. In addition we require the leading log contribution in the low y cut region of the threejet rate distribution to be well below unity to ensure that the NLLA is valid. The leading log term is proportional to\u03b1 S \u2022 ln 2 (1/y cut ) and requiring this term to be well below unity leads us to a lower limit of y cut = 0.01 assuming a value of the strong coupling \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.118. The upper limit is determined by requiring the leading order contribution A(y cut ) to be larger than zero. The corrections are small in this range with the detector corrections being less than 30 % and the hadronisation corrections being less than 30 %, apart from the corrections at the centre-of-mass energy of 14 GeV, which are up to 70 %. The considerations described above lead to a fit range from 0.01 to 0.2, which is identical to the fit range used for the determination of \u03b1 S using the differential y 23 event shape distribution [24].",

The fit range is chosen to be identical to the fit range used in the default fit. We perform two different fits using different choices for the renormalisation scale parameter: a fixed value of x \u03bc = 1 and the optimised renormalisation scheme, where x \u03bc is an additional free parameter in the fit. The numbers in Table 5 show the result obtained at a centre-of-mass energy of 35.0 GeV, the energy point with the largest number of selected hadronic events. The results obtained at all energy points are summarised in Appendix C in Table 8 and Table 9.

For both renormalisation scale schemes the scale uncertainty is considerably increased compared to the measurement using matched NNLO + NLLA + K predictions. In addition the difference between the fit using the natural and the optimised renormalisation scale is increased compared to a comparison using matched NNLO + NLLA + K predictions. A large sensitivity to the choice of the fit range is observed for a fit using NNLO predictions only.

            "text": "In this paper we present a measurement of the strong coupling \u03b1 S using the three-jet rate taken with the JADE experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 14 and 43.8 GeV. The three-jet rate is compared to simulated events obtained with PYTHIA, HERWIG and ARIADNE. All Monte Carlo models reproduce the measured distributions well. The strong coupling \u03b1 S is measured by a fit to matched NNLO + NLLA + K predictions. The combined value using the measurements between 22 and 43.8 GeV results in \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1199 \u00b1 0.0060 (total error). The value is consistent with the world average [35]. The theory uncertainty has shrunk considerably by using matched NNLO + NLLA + K calculations and among the uncertainties it is the smallest. The dominant uncertainty originates from applying different Monte Carlo models to estimate the transition from partons to hadrons. A fit using NNLO predictions only with the renormalisation scale parameter x \u03bc set to one cannot describe the shape of the three-jet rate distribution well. The shape can only be described well if \u03b1 S and x \u03bc are fitted simultaneously. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the \u03b1 S measurement presented in this paper with previous \u03b1 S measurements using Fig. 7 Comparison of the \u03b1 S measurement obtained in this analysis with previous \u03b1 S measurements using the three-jet rate, the four-jet rate and the y 23 -differential distribution in e + e \u2212 -annihilation between 14 and 91 GeV using matched and unmatched QCD predictions. The 1st measurement (top down) is the result of the present analysis, the 2nd is the measurement using the differential two-jet rate distribution y 23 with NNLO + NLLA calculations and data taken between 14 and 44 GeV [24], the 3rd is the measurement using the four-jet rate using matched NLO + NLLA + K predictions and data between 14 and 44 GeV [14], the 4th is the measurement using the differential two-jet rate distribution y 23 with NNLO + NLLA calculations and data taken at 91 GeV [33] and the 5th is a measurement using the three-jet rate at a centre-of-mass energy of 91 GeV using NNLO predictions only [13] higher order QCD predictions. The results obtained with a fit to the y 23 -distribution using data taken with the JADE [24] and the OPAL experiments [33] are expected to be strongly correlated with the three-jet rate and are considered as a good cross check. The measured mean values, similar to the result obtained with this analysis, are slightly above the world average value. The measurements using the four-jet rate and data taken with the JADE experiment [14] and the three-jet rate using data taken with the ALEPH experiment [13] are consistent within the uncertainties. All measurements are in agreement with the world average value of \u03b1 S [35].",

The \u03c7 2 /d.o.f.-value obtained with x \u03bc = 1 increases significantly compared to the corresponding NNLO + NLLA + K fit. The fit using the optimised renormalisation returns reasonable \u03c7 2 /d.o.f.-values and smaller x \u03bc -values. A similar behaviour was already observed using NLO predictions only with the renormalisation factor being set to x \u03bc = 1 and",
