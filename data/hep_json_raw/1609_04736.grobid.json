The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by the LHCb experiment. The differential branching fraction is reported in five narrow q 2 bins between 0.1 and 8.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and in the range 1.1 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 , where an angular moments analysis is also performed.",

This value is lower than naively expected from amplitude analyses of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [26].",
