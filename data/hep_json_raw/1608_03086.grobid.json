The cross section is measured in a fiducial phase-space region defined by the presence of exactly one electron and one muon, missing transverse momentum and exactly one jet with a transverse momentum above 25 GeV and a pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| < 4.5. The leptons are required to have opposite electric charge and to pass transverse momentum and pseudorapidity requirements. The fiducial cross section is found to be \u03c3 fid,1-jet",

The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions and found in good agreement.",

            "text": "The measurement of the production of two W bosons is a crucial test of the non-Abelian gauge structure of the electroweak theory of the Standard Model (SM). The increasing precision of the experimental measurements at the LHC has elicited improved theoretical descriptions of the process. Progress has been made to extend the next-to-leading-order (NLO) [1] calculation of pp \u2192 W + W \u2212 production to include next-to-next-to-leadingorder (NNLO) effects [2] in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A separate calculation of the loop-induced, non-resonant gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 production process has been made available at order O(\u03b1 3 S ) [3] in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S . Resonant W W * production via the exchange of a Higgs boson has been calculated to order O(\u03b1 3 S ) [4] and O(\u03b1 4 S ) [5]. These predictions can be summed to give an updated prediction for the total cross section of 65.0 +1.2 \u22121.1 pb as further detailed in Section 7. In addition to these new calculations, fully differential NNLO predictions [6] have become available, as have dedicated NLO predictions for jetassociated W W production [7,8] with up to three jets [9]. The resummation of logarithms arising from a selection on the num-E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. ber of jets has been presented at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy in Refs. [10,11]. It is therefore interesting to study W W production in association with jets to confront these calculations with experimental data from the LHC.",

These events samples are normalised to the respective NNLO+NNLL calculations [33][34][35][36] to obtain the relative contribution to the total top-quark background, whose overall normalisation is determined from data as detailed in Section 4. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).

Top quarks decay almost exclusively to a b-quark and a W boson. This makes tt and single top-quark production the dominant background to W W production, in particular for events with jets in the final state. The background yield from top-quark production is determined using a method proposed in Ref. [51]. The event yield is extrapolated from a control sample enriched in events from top-quark production. It is defined by the nominal selection requirements but must contain exactly one identified b-jet with p T > 25 GeV and within |\u03b7| < 2.5, instead of requiring the absence of identified b-jets. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the b-jet in the control sample is shown in Fig. 1(a). The data is used to constrain the large experimental and theoretical uncertainties shown by the error bands. The factor to extrapolate from this control sample to the signal sample is determined as the ratio of jets passing or failing the b-jet requirement in additional control samples, defined by the presence of two jets, at least one of which passes the b-tag requirement. Systematic effects resulting from the choice of the control sample are corrected for by an additional factor estimated from simulated event samples. The correction introduces experimental systematic uncertainties of \u00b13.1%, mainly from the uncertainty in the jet energy scale. Theoretical uncertainties are found to amount to \u00b12.5%",

Furthermore, electrons and muons are required to be oppositely charged and to originate directly from W decays. The same selection requirements on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity as at reconstruction level are applied to the dressed leptons.

The first two theoretical predictions are taken from either the Powheg+Pythia 8 or the MC@NLO+Jimmy qq \u2192 W + W \u2212 samples. The theoretical uncertainty in these predictions is assessed by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales independently by factors of 0.5 and 2 with the constraint 0.5 < \u03bc F /\u03bc R < 2. The contributions from resonant and non-resonant gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 production are taken in both cases from the respective Powheg+Pythia 8 and gg2ww samples, which increase the prediction for R 1 due to more initial-state radiation from gluons than quarks. The full effect of omitting the gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 contributions is assigned as further theoretical uncertainty. To investigate resummation effects, a third prediction is obtained from the qq \u2192 W + W \u2212 and gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 samples as discussed above, but with the Powheg+Pythia 8 qq \u2192 W + W \u2212 sample reweighted to reproduce the p T,W W distribution as predicted by the NLO+NNLL calculation in Ref. [10]. In addition to renormalisation and factorisation scales, the resummation scale is varied here. Finally, predictions for R 1 are obtained by using recent fixed-order calculations 2 The prediction for the total cross section is slightly larger than the one cited in Ref.",

These programs allow the application of the fiducial lepton and missing transverse momentum selections avoiding the use of acceptance factors derived from lower-order programs. Jets are clustered from the final state partons using the anti-k t algorithm with the radius parameter R = 0.4. A correction for non-perturbative effects from hadronisation and the underlying event is derived by comparing samples of Madgraph [68] using the CT10 PDF interfaced with Pythia 8 and the AU2 tune with these effects enabled or disabled. A systematic uncertainty is derived by interfacing the Madgraph samples with Herwig++ [69] and the AUET2 tune. The renormalisation and factorisation scales for the Matrix and MCFM predictions are set to \u03bc R = \u03bc F = m W and an uncertainty is obtained by varying those independently by factors of 0.5 and 2 with the constraint 0.5 < \u03bc F /\u03bc R < 2.
