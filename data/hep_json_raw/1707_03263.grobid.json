The observables are defined as a ratio of cross sections, for events containing jets and large missing transverse momentum to events containing jets and a pair of charged leptons from the decay of a Z /\u03b3 * boson. This definition minimises experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties in the measurements. This ratio is measured differentially with respect to a number of kinematic properties of the hadronic system in two phase-space regions; one inclusive single-jet region and one region sensitive to vectorboson-fusion topologies. The data are found to be in agreement with the Standard Model predictions and used to constrain a variety of theoretical models for dark-matter production, including simplified models, effective field theory models, and invisible decays of the Higgs boson. The measurements use 3.2 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and are fully corrected for detector effects, meaning that the data can be used to constrain new-physics models beyond those shown in this paper. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

Despite its many successes, it is known that the SM does not provide a complete description: for example it does not explain the abundance of dark matter in our universe, known to exist from astrophysical observations [1][2][3]. One of the main aims of the physics programme at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4] is to find evidence of new phenomena, either via directly e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch searching for the signatures predicted by specific scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) or, as is the case in this paper, by performing a more general search for deviations from SM predictions.",

            "text": "New physics phenomena at the LHC may manifest themselves as events with jets of collimated, mostly hadronic, particles and a momentum imbalance in the plane transverse to the LHC beams, known as missing transverse momentum, p may indicate the presence of particles that do not interact via the strong or electromagnetic interactions and therefore cannot be directly detected in the LHC detectors. These particles are referred to as invisible. In particular, new-physics models predicting the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), dark-matter candidates that could be produced at the LHC, could lead to such a signature [5]. As an example, a Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. 1a, where a mediator, A, is produced in association with a gluon-initiated jet and decays to a WIMP pair (\u03c7\u03c7). Limits have previously been placed in such models by comparing the number of events in p miss T + jets final states in LHC data with the number of background events expected to be seen in the detector (the detector level) [6,7]. Another possible production mechanism for the experimental observation of weakly interacting BSM particles is vector-boson fusion (VBF) [8], as shown in Fig. 1b. This is a topology similar to that in the invisible decay of a VBF-produced Higgs boson [9][10][11], for which limits have previously been set [12,13] using detectorlevel data. The dominant SM process leading to the same final states is the production of a Z boson in association with jets, where the Z boson decays to a pair of neutrinos. Example diagrams are shown in Fig. 1c, d.",

            "text": "This paper presents a measurement of differential observables that are sensitive to the anomalous production of events containing one or more hadronic jets with high transverse momentum, p T , produced in association with a large p miss T . The measurements are performed using data corresponding + jets events, which corresponds to the fiducial cross-section for inclusive Z (\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+ jets production in the SM. The denominator is the fiducial crosssection for + \u2212 + jets events, where the unobserved system that produces the p miss T in the numerator is replaced by an observed, opposite-sign, same-flavour pair of charged leptons consistent with originating from a Z /\u03b3 * boson. The lepton pair can be either a pair of electrons or muons. The jet system is required to satisfy very similar selection criteria in both the p miss T +jets and + \u2212 +jets samples of events so as to significantly reduce experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the ratio measurement. The presence of BSM physics in the numerator would lead to a discrepancy between the measured ratio and that predicted by the SM. The approach used in this paper allows for direct comparison of SM and BSM predictions at the particle level, without the need to simulate the effects of the ATLAS detector. This is computationally efficient and enables those without access to a precise simulation of the ATLAS detector to compare the data with predictions from alternative BSM models as they become available. Since each alternative BSM model may predict event signatures with different kinematic properties, the publication of the kinematic distributions enhances the usefulness and longevity of the data. Furthermore, future improvements in the predictions of the SM processes that contribute to the ratio can be compared to the particle-level data and limits in BSM models can be updated accordingly.",

Samples of events were produced with Monte Carlo event generators and are used to correct the data for detector effects, to estimate background and signal contributions, and to assign systematic uncertainties to the results. Details of these samples are given in Sect. 5. Predicted backgrounds, explained in Sect. 6, are subtracted from the selected data and the ratio is computed. A correction for detector effects is applied to the ratios, as described in Sect. 7, so that they are defined at particle level with the definitions from Sect. 3. Systematic uncertainties in the measurement and theoretical predictions are summarised in Sect. 8. The detector-corrected events in the electron and muon channels are combined to form particle-level ratios to + \u2212 + jets events, as described in Sect. 9. These are compared to the expected SM ratios and to the expected ratios including example BSM models in Sect. 10.

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. Rapidity is defined as y = 0.5 ln",

In particular, for the + \u2212 + jets denominator, the measured momenta of selected electrons, muons, and jets close to muons which are consistent with being associated with finalstate radiation photons clustered close to the muon ID track, are treated as invisible. A jet is considered to be consistent with a final-state photon if its transverse momentum is less than twice the transverse momentum of the associated muon and it has fewer than five associated ID tracks. This makes p miss T very similar between numerator and denominator. Events containing single Z and W bosons in association with jets were simulated using the Sherpa v2.2.0 event generator [28]. Matrix elements were calculated for up to two additional parton emissions at next-to-leadingorder (NLO) accuracy and up to four additional parton emissions at leading-order (LO) accuracy using the Comix [29] and OpenLoops [30] matrix element generators and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [31], which is based on Catani-Seymour subtraction terms. The merging of multiparton matrix elements with the parton shower is achieved using an improved CKKW matching procedure [32,33], which is extended to NLO accuracy using the MEPS@NLO prescription [34]. The NNPDF3.0nnlo parton distribution function (PDF) set [35] was used in conjunction with the dedicated parton-shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. These V +jets samples were produced with a simplified scale-setting prescription in the multi-parton matrix elements to improve the event generation speed. A theory-based reweighting of the jet-multiplicity distribution is applied, derived from event generation with the strict scale prescription. The samples are normalised to a next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) prediction [36]. The full set-up is described in detail in Ref. [37]. Electroweakly produced V +jets as well as diboson production were generated using Sherpa v2.1.1 in conjunction with the CT10nlo [38] PDF set and the dedicated parton-shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. The full set-up is described in detail in Ref. [39].",

Scale factors are applied to the simulated events to correct for the small differences from data in the trigger, reconstruction, identification, isolation, and impact parameter efficiencies for leptons [22,23]. Furthermore, the lepton and jet momentum scales and resolutions are adjusted to match the data. Additional proton-proton collisions in the same bunch crossing are overlaid. These are based on soft strong-interaction processes simulated with Pythia v8.186 using the MSTW2008lo PDF set [71] along with the A2 set of tuned parton-shower parameters [72]. The average number of proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing in this data set is 13.7. + jets signal region. In the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd control region, the muon is treated as an invisible particle in the p miss T calculation, in order to make the region as similar as possible to the signal region. This is because the signal region has a veto on reconstructed muons and so the muon is often not included in the p miss T calculation. In the W \u2192 e\u03bd control region, the energy of the electron is included in the p miss T calculation, calibrated as a jet. This is because the electron is usually included in the signal region for W \u2192 e\u03bd events, where the electron is generally inside the acceptance of the calorimeter, but is not identified, as a veto on identified electrons is applied in the signal region. W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd events, where the \u03c4 decay includes a muon (electron), are included in the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd (W \u2192 e\u03bd) control regions so that the contribution of these events to the signal region is also included in this estimate.",

A small background contribution from multijet events in the control region is estimated using dedicated MC simulation and subtracted from the data. The efficiency-and multijet-corrected data are then used to predict the contribution from W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd and W \u2192 e\u03bd events in the signal, which contains two types of events: those for which the lepton is inside the detector acceptance with p T > 7 GeV but does not pass the lepton reconstruction and identification criteria, and those with a lepton that is outside of the detector acceptance or has p T < 7 GeV. The in-acceptance contribution is determined for each bin of a given distribution from the efficiencycorrected data in the control region by applying an additional weight of (1 \u2212 ) per event as well as correcting for the small difference in lepton fiducial acceptance between the control region and the signal region, using an acceptancecorrection factor that is estimated using MC simulation. The out-of-acceptance contribution is obtained by extrapolating efficiency-corrected in-acceptance data using again acceptance corrections derived from simulation. As a cross-check, the W background estimate is also determined using an alternative method, described in Ref. [6], where no efficiency weights are applied to data and the simulation is used to extrapolate from the control region to the signal region. Compatible results are found.",

The remaining background is estimated using a control region where at least one of the four leading jets satisfies the criterion \u03c6 jet i ,p miss T < 0.1. A large multijet data sample is obtained from events selected with single-jet triggers. These control events are required to be well measured, meaning that the p miss T is low. In order to obtain a sample of events that pass the p miss T selection, the jets in these events are smeared 25,000 times per multijet control event, according to the full jet response distribution. This sample is used to extrapolate between the control region and the signal region. from the background processes. Discrepancies between data and simulation of up to 50% are seen in the control region, depending on the phase space and the kinematic region. A reweighting factor is found by fitting a polynomial to the ratio of data to simulation in the control region and is applied to the background contribution in the signal region. The full difference between the background prediction with and without this reweighting is taken as a systematic uncertainty. ",

In the absence of a BSM signal, dependencies of the migrations on the underlying distributions are very similar for the numerator and denominator and therefore systematic uncertainties arising from this source cancel in the ratio. The possible impact of signals on the correction factors has been studied and found to be small. The presence of a large BSM component in the numerator due to WIMP production with an axial-vector mediator mass of 1 TeV and a WIMP mass of 150 GeV (which has very different event kinematics to the SM processes) changes the correction factor by less than 0.5%. The injected BSM model events have a p miss T distribution that is much harder than the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd contribution to the numerator, leading to changes in R miss of 4% at low p miss T and 50% at high p miss T . Such a variation is much larger than the differences seen between data and SM simulation. Furthermore, injecting a Gaussian BSM contribution that adds events to a single bin (but remains consistent with the data) is also found to have a very small impact; the largest change in the correction factor is 2%, in the second bin of the p   tribution, which is small compared to the systematic uncertainties. This test is an extreme example, where it is assumed that the full difference between the SM prediction and data in the R miss ratio is due to BSM physics in the numerator. It is therefore concluded that the presence of any BSM model consistent with the data would lead to only small changes in the correction factors and that these models can be constrained by the detector-corrected results. Larger BSM contributions that could cause more significant changes in the correction factors have already been excluded with the detector-level data.",

            "text": "Uncertainties in the measured detector-corrected ratios are discussed in this section and summarised in Table 2. The dominant experimental systematic uncertainties come from the reconstruction and isolation efficiency of muons and the reconstruction, isolation and trigger efficiency of electrons. These uncertainties affect the detector corrections, the W background predictions from leptonic control regions and the backgrounds to + \u2212 + jets events. A smaller uncertainty in the \u03c4 reconstruction efficiency, affecting the \u03c4 veto, is also included. These are collectively labelled \"Lepton efficiency\" in the table. Uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution, labelled \"Jets\" in the table, affect the background predictions as well as the detector corrections. The latter arises due to small differences between the selected events for the numerator and denominator, such as the removal of jets close to leptons. The uncertainty from the difference in the choice of control region for the W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd background prediction, described in Sect. 6, is also included. For the multijet background estimation a 50% uncertainty in the number of predicted events, together with a smaller uncertainty found by varying the selection criteria for events used as input for the smearing method, is assumed. The difference between the reweighted and nominal MC simulation background prediction of + \u2212 + jets events is taken as an uncertainty. The reweighting factor is obtained from an e \u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 control region, described in Sect. 6. Statistical uncertainties from the finite size of the MC simulation samples used to determine the detector corrections, in the W control region data, and MC simulation samples used for extrapolations are also included. Three categories of theoretical uncertainties are considered. Firstly, an uncertainty of 30% in the cross-section of processes involving top quarks in the numerator is assigned. This indirectly affects the extrapolation of W events to the signal region by altering the number of top quark events in the control regions. The uncertainty value is motivated by topquark-enhanced control regions constructed using the same criteria as the W control regions but in addition requiring either one or two jets consistent with containing a b-hadron. Discrepancies between MC simulation and data of up to 30% are seen in these control regions, which justifies the large uncertainty. Secondly, theoretical uncertainties that affect the extrapolations between the control and signal regions for W backgrounds are included. These are estimated by varying the factorisation, renormalisation, resummation scales (each scale varied by factors of 0.5 and 2) and the CKKW match-ing [32,33] scale between 30 GeV and 15 GeV (the nominal being 20 GeV). These variations were found to affect the control and signal regions in the same way and the resulting uncertainties are therefore treated as fully correlated between the two. PDF uncertainties are derived for the nominal NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF set [35] as well as the MMHT2014 [73] and CT14 [74] PDF sets using their recommended PDF uncertainty prescription. A combined PDF uncertainty is then obtained from the envelope of the three PDF families and their respective uncertainties. An uncertainty from the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S m Z is derived using up and down variations to 0.117 and 0.119, respectively (the nominal value being 0.118). Thirdly, the change in the W background predictions when using Sherpa [28] v2.1.1 (which uses the CT10nlo [38] PDF set and has some technical differences in the parton shower compared to v2.2.0) or MG5_aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [40] instead of Sherpa v2.2.0 is considered. The second and third theoretical sources are included as \"W theory\" in Table 2. The correction factors do not change significantly when varying the SM MC event generator.",

The technique correlates the statistical and systematic uncertainties between the two measurements and between all bins in all distributions. The combined result produces an average for + \u2212 + jets of one flavour in the denominator. The combination is iterated once, replacing the statistical uncertainty in the observed number of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and Z \u2192 ee events with that obtained from the expected number of events after the first combination. This removes the effect of undue weight being given to the channel in which the number of events has fluctuated down. In the combination, statistical correlations between bins are accounted for using a bootstrap method [76]. The Z \u2192 background uncertainty is assumed to be fully correlated or anticorrelated between bins, depending on whether the fit to estimate Z \u2192 background events increases or decreases the result from MC simulation in a given bin. The correlation between bins for the electron and muon efficiency uncertainties is found by considering the separate sources that contribute to the total uncertainties. All other sources of systematic uncertainty are assumed to be fully correlated across bins in the combination. The p-value for the compatibility of the two channels for all four distributions is 74%. The ratio is then formed by subtracting the estimated backgrounds from the selected p miss T + jets event sample in the data and dividing by the combined denominator. Again, each source of systematic uncertainty is assumed to be fully correlated between numerator and denominator. A cross-check using a maximum-likelihood fitting method gives consistent results. Figure 4 shows the four combined differential measurements of R miss compared to the average of the Sherpa v2.2.0 SM particle-level predictions for the muon and electron channels. The measurement is consistent with the SM prediction within statistical uncertainties. The uncertainty in the SM prediction, found from the factorisation and renormalisation scale variations as well as the NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF uncertainty, explained in Sect. 8, is shown as a red hatched band in the figure. The SM predictions do not include NLO electroweak corrections beyond final-state photon radiation. These corrections were studied in Ref. [77] for the Z boson production at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and are very similar for the numerator and denominator with a residual effect of up to 1% on the ratio. Also shown in the Fig. 4 is a comparison with SM+BSM for four BSM models. These four models comprise a simpli-fied model for WIMP production with an s-channel exchange of an axial-vector mediator with a mass of 1 TeV and a WIMP mass of 10 GeV, a Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles with 50% branching fraction, and two examples of effective field theory operators (each with different charge-parity properties) involving couplings of WIMP dark-matter candidates with vector bosons. These models are described in Sect. 5.",

The overall rate and kinematic properties of events in the axial-vector mediator WIMP model under study are defined by four parameters: the WIMP candidate mass, the mediator mass and the strengths of the mediator interaction with quarks and WIMPs. The expected and observed 95% con-fidence level (CL) exclusion limits as a function of mediator and WIMP mass are shown in Fig. 5, for fixed mediator couplings of g q = 0.25 and g \u03c7 = 1. Expected limits are shown with \u00b11\u03c3 bands indicating the range of the expected limit in the absence of a signal. Observed limits are shown with a band including the effect of \u00b11\u03c3 theoretical uncertainties in the WIMP model cross-section. Also highlighted is the region where perturbative unitarity is violated (where m \u03c7 > \u221a \u03c0/2 m A ) [82]. The points in the mass plane compatible with the relic density measured by Planck [83] and WMAP [84] are represented by a red continuous line, with WIMP masses below this line or mediator masses to the right  distributions in the \u2265 1 jet and VBF phase spaces, and the m jj and \u03c6 jj distributions in the VBF phase space of this line corresponding to dark-matter overproduction. The highest mediator mass observed (expected) to be excluded at 95% CL is 1.24 TeV (1.09 TeV). For comparison, limits set using detector-level observables [6] are also shown. For high mediator masses, the expected limits in the present analysis are slightly weaker, due to the limited number of events in the denominator, whereas the observed limits are slightly stronger compared to the detector-level analysis. This difference between expected and observed limits is driven entirely by systematic uncertainty correlations between bins of the corrected distributions. Switching between using the default correlation model and a simple correlation model assuming 100% correlation between bins for each source of experimental systematic uncertainty changes the observed limit in mediator mass by approximately 10 GeV. The measurements presented in this paper have enhanced sensitivity to models with large WIMP masses and low mediator masses, with respect to the detector-level analysis presented in Ref. [6], due to the use of a larger fiducial volume and the use of differential information with associated correlations.",

Limits in simplified models are competitive with previous approaches and the use of shape information in the differential spectra measured in this paper provides improved sensitivity to models where the dark-matter candidate mass is close to half the mediator mass. For the specific effective field theory operators considered in the interpretation, the dark-matter interactions would evade direct-detection experiments. The results presented here represent the most stringent constraints to date on such interactions, with an order-ofmagnitude improvement over previous limits from indirectdetection experiments.",

This background includes contributions where the W boson originates from a top-quark decay or diboson events. The top-quark decay contribution to the W background amounts to approximately 18% (14%) in the \u2265 1 jet (VBF) phase spaces. The three lepton decay channels of the W background contribute approximately 18% (W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd), 12% (W \u2192 e\u03bd) and 15% (W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) to the numerator.
