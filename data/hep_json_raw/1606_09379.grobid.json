The (anti-) deuterons are identified using the specific energy loss in the time projection chamber and the velocity information in the time-of-flight detector. The elliptic flow of (anti-)deuterons can provide insight into the production mechanisms of particles in heavy-ion collisions. Quark coalescence is one of the approaches to describe the elliptic flow of hadrons, while the production of light nuclei can be also depicted as a coalescence of nucleons. In these proceedings, the measured v 2 of deuterons produced in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV will be compared to expectations from coalescence and hydrodynamic models.",

For identified hadrons v 2 is sensitive to the partonic degrees of freedom in the early stages of the evolution of a heavy-ion collision [2]. The deuteron is a composite p+n bound state, whose binding energy (\u223c 2.24 MeV) is much lower than the hadronization temperature. Thus, it is likely that it would suffer from medium induced breakup in the hadronic phase, even if it was produced at hadronization. The v 2 measurements for d and d provide an important test for the universal scaling of elliptic flow [3] since its v 2 should be additive both with respect to the v 2 of its constituent hadrons and with respect to the v 2 of the constituent quarks of these hadrons, i.e. n q = 2 \u00d7 3. In these proceedings, the measurements of (anti-)deuterons v 2 are compared to other identified particles [4] and to a model based on hydrodynamics [5,6].",

The events were classified into 6 different centrality intervals, which were determined using the forward V0 [8] scintillator arrays. Particle tracking is done by means of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [9] and the Inner Tracking System (ITS) [10] with full azimuthal coverage for |\u03b7| <0.8. The identification of deuteron (d) and anti-deuteron (d) was performed in the same way as done to extract deuteron spectra in Pb-Pb [11]. Specifically, for momenta up to 1 GeV/c the energy loss in the TPC gives a clean sample of (anti-)deuterons by requiring a maximum deviation of the specific energy loss of 3\u03c3 with respect to the expected signal. Above 1 GeV/c a Time of Fight (TOF) [7] hit is required. The signal in the TOF detector is fitted with a function which is the sum of a Gaussian with an exponential tail, while the background is fitted with an exponential. As an example of the \u2206M, where \u2206M = m TOF -m d PDG , for deuterons and anti-deuterons with 2.20 < p T < 2.40 GeV/c and centrality interval 30-40% is shown in the left part of Figure 1. The v 2 was measured using the Scalar Product (SP) method [12]. The contribution to the measured elliptic flow (v 2 Tot ) due to misidentified deuterons (v 2 Bkg ) was removed by studying the azimuthal correlations versus \u2206M. This method is based on the observation that, since v 2 is additive, candidate v 2",
