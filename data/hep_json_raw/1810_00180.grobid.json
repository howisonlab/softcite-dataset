            "text": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes hadrons as the bound states of quarks held together via the color force mediated by gluons. The non-Abelian nature of the QCD allows the self-interaction of gluons that can form the hadronic matter. These quarkless states are called 'glueballs'. The lattice QCD predicts that the glueballs having mass within the range of 1 \u2212 2 (2 \u2212 3) GeV/c 2 are scalar (tensor or pseudoscalar) [1]. The branching fractions for glueballs in the radiative decays of J/\u03c8 are expected to be within the range of 10 \u22122 \u2212 10 \u22123 depending upon the exact nature of glueballs [2]. The large data samples collected at the center-of-mass (CM) energies between 2.0 \u2212 4.6 GeV, more than 130 energy points, including the J/\u03c8 resonance, by BESIII provide an ideal avenue to explore the possibilities of these glueballs. The QCD also allows other possible forms of multiquark and hybrid states, such as a tetraquark-like Z c that was observed in the \u03c0J/\u03c8 mass spectrum in Y(4260) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 decays by the BESIII [3] and intermediately confirmed by Belle experiment [4]. Similar to Z c [3,4], a strangeonium-like state is also expected in the \u03c0\u03c6 spectrum via \u03c6 (2170) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c6 decays, where \u03c6 (2170) [also denoted as Y(2175)] is analogous to Y(4260) [5]. The \u03c6 (2170) was observed by the BaBar collaboration via the initial-state-radiation process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6 f 0 (980) [6], and later confirmed by Belle [7], BESII [8] and BESIII collaborations [9]. Following sections summarize recent results of BESIII related to the gluonic and strangeonium-like states.",

This enhancement might be due to an X(1835) state, which was first observed by BESII in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [13] and later confirmed by BESIII in the same process [14] and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7K 0 S K 0 S decays [15]. The observed spin-parity of X(pp) and X(3872) states is in favor of J P = 0 \u2212 [11,15]. By analyzing the decay process of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with 1.1 billion J/\u03c8 events collected in 2012, BESIII has observed a significant abrupt change in the slope of the \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum at the pp mass threshold [16]. Two typical models are used to characterize the \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line-shape around 1.85 GeV/c 2 ( Figure 1). The first incorporates the opening of the decay threshold in the mass spectrum (Flatt\u00e9 formula), while the second uses a coherent sum of two resonant amplitudes. Both the models describe the data, and well, suggesting the existence of either a pp molecule-like or bound state [16]. 2.2 Observation of \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7(1475) and X(1835) in J J J/ / /\u03c8 \u03c8 \u03c8 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6",

Many experimental results reveal the existence of two different pseudoscalar states, the \u03b7(1405) and \u03b7(1475) [21]. The former is interpreted as an excellent candidate for 0 \u2212+ glueball [21], and later as the first excitation of the \u03b7 . A triangle singularity is proposed to explain these anomalies by assuming both \u03b7(1405) and \u03b7(1475) to be a single state, the \u03b7(1440), that appears as different line-shapes in different channels [22]. The J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c6 decay is studied using 1.3 billion J/\u03c8 events collected by the BESIII detector [23]. Two resonant structures corresponding to \u03b7(1475) and X(1835) are observed in the \u03b3\u03c6 invariant mass spectrum with a significance of 13.5\u03c3 and 6.3\u03c3 , respectively, by taking into account to interference between these two resonant structures during the fit (Figure 2 (a,b)). The angular distributions of these resonances are observed to be J PC = 0 \u2212+ (Figure 2 (c,d)). These results reveal that both \u03b7(1475) and X(1835) contain a sizable ss component. ",

The lattice QCD theory predicts the ratios of branching fractions of pseudoscalar glueball decays \u0393 G\u2192KK\u03b7 /\u0393 tot G and \u0393 G\u2192\u03c0\u03c0\u03b7 /\u0393 tot G to be 0.011 and 0.090, respectively, where the glueball mass is set at 2.37 GeV/c 2 [24]. The observation of these states in KK\u03b7 decays would support the hypothesis that they are glueballs. The search for X(2120) and X(2370) is performed via the decays of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K + K \u2212 \u03b7 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 using 1.3 billion J/\u03c8 events. A structure around 2.34 GeV/c 2 , the X(2370), is observed in the KK\u03b7 spectra with a statistical significance of 7.6\u03c3 (Figure 3).",

These results are preliminary. 3 Search for strangeonium-like states 3.1 Search for strangeonium-like structure Z S at 2.125 GeV A search for Z S strangeonium-like structure is performed in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c0\u03c0 using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of (108.49 \u00b1 0.75) pb \u22121 , taken at the CM energy of 2.125 GeV by the BESIII detector [25]. A partial wave analysis of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c0\u03c0 is performed to describe the di-pion invariant spectrum after applying all the selection criteria. The fit includes the amplitudes of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c3 , \u03c6 f 0 (980), \u03c6 f 0 (1370) and \u03c6 f 2 (1270) with a spin-parity of J P = 1 + . No evidence for Z S production is found in the invariant mass spectra of \u03c6 \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03c6 \u03c0 0 around 1.4 GeV/c 2 . The 90% CL upper limits on the cross-section of Z S production are determined under different assumptions of mass, width and spin-parity of Z S (Figure 4). In addition, the cross-section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 at 2.125 GeV/c 2 are measured as (343.0 \u00b1 5.1 \u00b1 25.1) pb and (208.3 \u00b1 7.6 \u00b1 13.6) pb, respectively. The first one slightly differs from BaBar [26] and Belle [7] measurements, being consistent within 3\u03c3 , whereas the second is consistent with the BaBar measurement [26] . ",
