The simple model, however, has a number of limitations that are ameliorated [6] by a socalled \"extended Higgs sector\". Supersymmetry [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] requires such an extended Higgs sector, with new spin-0 particles. Another class of models with warped extra dimensions, proposed by Randall and Sundrum [15], postulates the existence of a compact fourth spatial dimension with a warped metric. Such compactification creates heavy resonances arising as -1 -",

The ATLAS [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] and CMS [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57] collaborations have conducted a number of searches for these particles, where the new bosons decay into vector bosons and/or Higgs bosons (WW, ZZ, WZ, HH, ZH, or WH). In this paper, we describe a search for narrow resonances (X) decaying to HH, where one H decays to a bottom quark pair (bb) and the other decays to a W boson pair, with at least one W boson off-shell (WW * ). These are the most likely and second-most likely Higgs boson decay channels, respectively. The otherwise large SM background of jets produced via quantum chromodynamics processes, referred to as \"multijet\" background, is greatly reduced by considering the WW * final state in which one W boson decays to quarks (qq ) and the other to either an electron-neutrino pair (e\u03bd) or a muon-neutrino pair (\u00b5\u03bd). This search is optimized for particle mass m X > 0.8 TeV and employs new techniques for this channel to recognize substructure within boosted jets. The search is performed on a data set collected in 2016 at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The Higgs bosons have a high Lorentz boost because of the large values of m X considered, and the decay products of each one are produced in a collimated cone. The H \u2192 bb decay is reconstructed as a single jet, referred to as the bb jet, with high transverse momentum p T . The H \u2192 WW * decay is also reconstructed as a single jet, referred to as the qq jet, but with a nearby lepton (e or \u00b5). In both cases, the jets are required to have a reconstructed topology consistent with a substructure arising from a boson decaying to two quarks. The semileptonic Higgs boson decay chain is reconstructed from both the visible decay products and the missing transverse momentum. A distinguishing characteristic of the signal is a peak in the two-dimensional plane of the bb jet mass m bb and the reconstructed HH invariant mass m HH .",

The top quarks affecting this analysis have decay products that are collimated because of large boosts. In particular, the all-hadronic top quark decays can be misreconstructed as single bb jets. Peaks in the m bb distribution from this background correspond to fully contained top quark and W boson decays. The second-largest background is primarily composed of production of W bosons in association with jets (W + jets) and multijet events. Both W + jets and multijet background events are experimentally distinct from tt production, in part because their m bb distributions are smoothly falling.",

Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a twotiered trigger system [58]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [59].",

Reconstructed electrons are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, and are identified with a high-purity selection to suppress the potentially large multijet background [84]. Muons are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and to pass identification criteria optimized to select muons with >95% efficiency [85]. The impact parameter of lepton tracks with respect to the primary vertex is required to be consistent with originating from that vertex: longitudinal distance <0.1 cm, transverse distance <0.05 cm, and significance <4 standard deviations of the three-dimensional displacement. These criteria remove background events where the lepton is produced by a semileptonic heavy-flavor decay rather than a W boson decay. In addition, these criteria prevent incorrectly selecting a lepton from a heavy-flavor decay in signal events. Requiring leptons to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity is important to suppress background, but can also cause significant signal inefficiency because of the collinear decay of the Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson. This inefficiency is mitigated by using an isolation definition specifically designed for leptons from boosted decays [86]. The isolation metric I rel is the p T sum of the PF particles with \u2206R < \u2206R iso with respect to the lepton, divided by the lepton p T .

The neutral particle contribution to I rel from pileup interactions is estimated and removed using the method described in ref. [84]. Electrons are selected with I rel < 0.1, whereas muons, because of lower background rates, are selected with I rel < 0.2. Muons in signal events have an approximate efficiency of 85% for m X = 0.8 TeV, decreasing to 70% for m X = 3.5 TeV, with isolation being the leading source of inefficiency compared to all other requirements. The efficiency to select electrons is lower, approximately 40% for m X = 0.8 TeV, decreasing to 6% for m X = 3.5 TeV. The leading source of electron inefficiency is a selection imposed at the reconstruction level on the ratio of the energy deposited in the HCAL to that deposited in the ECAL. Signal electrons typically fail this selection because of the nearby energy deposits from the hadronic W boson decay. Lepton reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies are measured in a Z \u2192 data sample with a \"tag-and-probe\" method [87] and the simulation is corrected for any discrepancies with the data. There is generally much less hadronic activity in Z \u2192 events than in signal events, so these corrections are parameterized by nearby hadronic activity to ensure their applicability. For this measurement, a lepton's hadronic activity is quantified by using the PF particles with \u2206R < 0.4 about the lepton to obtain two variables: the relative p T sum around the lepton and the \u2206R between the lepton and the p sum of these particles. When parameterized by these two variables, a similar drop in efficiency is measured in low \u2206R and high relative momentum Z \u2192 events as in signal events. The lepton selection efficiencies in simulation are found to be within 10% of those in data. The uncertainty in the correction is at its largest for high hadronic activity, with a maximum value of 10% for electrons and 5% for muons.",

Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions, increasing the apparent jet momentum. The pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [88] is used to mitigate the effect of pileup -5 -JHEP10(2019)125 at the reconstructed particle-level, making use of local shape information, event pileup properties, and tracking information. Charged particles identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded. For each neutral particle, a local shape variable is computed using the surrounding charged particles compatible with the primary vertex within the tracker acceptance (|\u03b7| < 2.5), and using both charged and neutral particles in the region outside of the tracker coverage. The momenta of the neutral particles are then rescaled according to their probability to originate from the primary interaction vertex deduced from the local shape variable [89]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation studies so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and in simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [90]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures [89].",

If there are two or more bb jet candidates, the one leading in p T is used. This jet is reconstructed as a bb jet if it is the leading or second-leading AK8 jet in p T , has p T > 200 GeV, and if two constituent subjets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 can be identified. The bb jet SD mass, which is the invariant mass of the two subjets, is used to obtain m bb . The mass grooming helps reject events for which the bb jet originates from a single quark or gluon. The performance of the SD algorithm varies with bb jet p T , so simulation-derived m bb correction factors are JHEP10 (2019)125applied as a function of p T to make the average m bb value be 125 GeV, the Higgs boson mass m H [98].",

As discussed in ref. [106], adaptive KDE can result in overestimation of the distribution tails in the case of large bandwidths being applied. This is ameliorated by imposing a maximum bandwidth value, which is usually chosen to be 1-5 times larger than the median bandwidth. The m HH tail is further smoothed by fitting with an exponential function for m HH 2 TeV. The P bb distributions are obtained for the m t and m W backgrounds by fitting m bb histograms with a double Crystal Ball function [107,108]. This function has a Gaussian core, which is used to model the bulk of the m bb distribution, and power-law tails, which describe the effects of more severe jet misreconstruction. The fits are performed for events binned in m HH to capture the evolution of the m bb shape with m HH . The double Crystal Ball function parameters are then interpolated between m HH bins. The P bb distributions for the lost t/W and q/g backgrounds are estimated from the two-dimensional histograms with two-dimensional KDE. Independent adaptive bandwidths and bandwidth upper limits are used for each dimension when forming the P bb . Similar to the derivation of the P HH , the m HH tails are smoothed with exponential function fits. Simulation yields are used as the initial values of the background yields in the fit to data.",

The observed exclusion limit is consistent with the expected limit; the most significant deviation between the two is about 1.5 standard deviations at m X \u2248 2.3 TeV. The sources of the discrepancy are small excesses in data at high m HH for the \u00b5, bM, LP and \u00b5, bL, HP event categories. The m X = 0.8 TeV spin-0 signal is excluded for \u03c3B > 123 fb, with the exclusion limit strengthening to \u03c3B > 8.3 fb for m X = 3.5 TeV signal. The higher signal acceptance for spin-2 signal results in stronger constraints on \u03c3B: >103 fb for m X = 0.8 TeV signal and >7.8 fb for m X = 3.5 TeV signal. This search yields the best limits in this decay channel for X \u2192 HH production. It has similar sensitivity to resonances with m X \u2248 1 TeV to searches performed in other channels [50,56].

The p miss T is an estimate of the transverse momentum of the neutrino in the semileptonic Higgs boson decay chain. The longitudinal momentum p z of this neutrino is estimated by setting the invariant mass of the neutrino, the lepton, and the qq jet to m H and solving the corresponding second-order equation. If two real solutions exist, the one with the smaller magnitude is chosen. If the p z solution is complex, the real component of the solution is used. Other methods for determining the neutrino p z , including choosing the other p z solution or incorporating the imaginary components, do not improve the m HH resolution. The reconstructed momentum of the W boson that decays to leptons, referred to as the \u03bd candidate, is obtained from the lepton and the estimated neutrino momenta. The WW * candidate momentum is then obtained from the combined \u03bd candidate and the qq jet momenta. The invariant mass of this object and the bb jet is m HH .",
