A search for the decays B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is performed with 0.41 fb \u22121 . The absence of significant signal leads to B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 at 95 % confidence level. The forward-backward asymmetry, fraction of longitudinal polarization and differential branching fraction of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , as a function of dimuon invariant mass, are measured in 0.31 fb \u22121 . The ratio of branching ratios of the radiative B decays B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 and B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 has been measured using 0.34 fb \u22121 . The obtained value for the ratio is 1.52 \u00b1 0.14(stat) \u00b1 0.10(syst) \u00b1 0.12( f s / f d ). Using the HFAG value for B(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3), B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3) has been found to be (2.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 .",

In models beyond the SM, new particles can enter in competing loop-order diagrams resulting in large deviations from SM predictions (see for example Refs. [5,6]). B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates are selected by first applying a loose pre-selection based on the B 0 lifetime, daughter impact parameters and a requirement that the B 0 points back to one of the primary vertices in the event. A tighter multivariate selection, based on a boosted decision tree (BDT), is then applied to select a clean sample of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates, with a signal-to-background ratio in a 100 MeV/c 2 window around the reconstructed B 0 mass of about three-to-one. The BDT is based on the B 0 kinematics, B 0 vertex quality, daughter track quality, impact parameter and kaon, pion and muon particle identification. The offline selection criteria are explicitly chosen to minimise angular acceptance effects. The multivariate selection was trained using B 0 d \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 candidates from the 2010 data as a proxy for the signal and B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates from the upper mass sideband of the 2010 data a e-mail: diego.martinez.santos@cern.ch for the background.

            "text": "The systematic error on A FB , F L and dBF/dq 2 is typically \u223c 30% of the statistical error. In the high-q 2 region, the dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the overall uncertainty on the acceptance correction which is dictated by the limited simulation statistics. This can clearly be improved for future analyses. Throughout, a sub-dominant contribution comes from the data-derived performance corrections. In particular, from knowledge of the PID performance and tracking efficiency in data. This is again statistically limited and can also be improved with larger datasets. When fitting for A FB and F L the signal and background mass model and the angular model for the background have been varied and yield corrections at the level of 10-20% of the statistical uncertainty. The uncertainty on the differential branching fraction includes the \u223c 4% uncertainty coming from the measured B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 branching fractions [8]. These measurements are current world best, and don't confirm previous hints of a non-SM value of A FB at low q 2 . coupling to a W boson. Extensions of the SM predict new heavy particles that may propagate virtually within the loop and modify the dynamics of the transition. Therefore, these radiative modes are promising laboratories that could reveal the presence of new phenomena beyond the SM with the precise measurement of the branching ratios, asymmetries or angular distributions. The offline selection of both the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 decays is performed with the strategy of maximizing the cancellation of systematic uncertainties when performing the ratio. The analysis of \u223c 341 pb \u22121 of LHCb data gives: Combining the ratio of branching fractions in 1 with the World Average measurement for the B(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 ) from [9], we obtain,",

However, contributions from new processes or new heavy particles can significantly enhance these values. For example, within Minimal Supersymmetric extensions of the SM (MSSM), in the large tan \u03b2 regime, B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) receives contributions proportional to tan 6 \u03b2 [11], where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral CP-even Higgs fields, and can differ significantly from the SM prediction. The LHCb analysis is done by clasifying B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates in bins of a 2D parameter space made by the invariant mass and a multivariate clasifier which condensates geometrical and kinematical information of the event.

            "text": "In 340 pb \u22121 of pp collisions at a centre of mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV the most precise measurement of B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3) has been performed, giving: In Fig. 2 the luminosity needed for a 3\u03c3 evidence as a function of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is shown. Approximately \u223c 2 fb \u22121 are needed in the case that the value is equal to the SM prediction, but statistical fluctuations can make it possible with \u223c 1 fb \u22121 . Fig. 2 also shows that exclusions of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) down to the (2\u00d7) SM level would impose important constraints in region around the current NUHM1 best fit point [15]. All the results presented here are current world best.  Fig. 2. Luminosity needed in order to get a B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 3\u03c3 evidence (top) or a 95%CL exclusion in the presence of a SM signal (center). The bottom plot shows how upper limits in the 10 \u22129 level would constraint the region around the minimum of the NUHM1 fit from [15].",
