The data, corresponding to 2:0 fb \u00c01 of integrated luminosity, were collected from pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Using events with a b-tagged jet and a Z boson reconstructed from opposite-charge electrons, the mass distribution of large transverse momentum b 0 candidates is tested for an enhancement. No evidence for a b 0 signal is detected in the observed mass distribution, resulting in the exclusion at a 95% confidence level of b 0 quarks with masses m b 0 < 400 GeV that decay entirely via b 0 ! Z \u00fe b. In the case of a vectorlike singlet b 0 mixing solely with the third standard model generation, masses m b 0 < 358 GeV are excluded.",

            "text": "The matter sector of the standard model (SM) consists of three generations of chiral fermions, with each generation containing a quark doublet and a lepton doublet. A natural question is whether quarks and leptons exist beyond the third generation [1]. In this Letter, we present a search for the pair production of a new quark with electric charge \u00c01=3, denoted b 0 , using data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. New quarks appear in a variety of models that address shortcomings of the SM [1][2][3][4][5]. In addition to signaling a richer matter content at high energy, their existence would impact lowerscale physics, such as altering Higgs boson (H) phenomenology [6], and providing new sources of CP violation potentially sufficient to generate the baryon asymmetry in the Universe [7].",

            "text": "Extensions to the SM often propose new quarks transforming as vectorlike representations of the electroweak gauge groups [2][3][4][5]. The decay of a vectorlike b 0 to a Z boson and a bottom quark is a tree-level process with a branching ratio comparable to that of the decay b 0 ! W \u00fe t. In particular, the branching ratios Wt:Zb:Hb approach the proportion 2:1:1 in the limit of a large b 0 mass as a consequence of the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem [2,5]. Furthermore, if a signal were observed in the WtWt final state, a search for a resonant Z \u00fe b signal would aid in establishing the charge of the new quark. In light of these observations, this search explores the Z \u00fe b jet final state for the presence of a b 0 quark. The ATLAS detector [15] consists of particle-tracking detectors, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. At small radii transverse to the beam line, the inner tracking system utilizes fine-granularity pixel and microstrip detectors designed to provide precision track impact parameter and secondary vertex measurements. These silicon-based detectors cover the pseudorapidity [16] range jj < 2:5. A gas-filled straw tube tracker complements the silicon tracker at larger radii. The tracking detectors are immersed in a 2 T magnetic field produced by a thin superconducting solenoid located in the same cryostat as the barrel electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter. The EM calorimeters employ lead absorbers and utilize liquid argon as the active medium. The barrel EM calorimeter covers jj < 1:5, and the end-cap EM calorimeters cover 1:4 < jj < 3:2. Hadronic calorimetry in the region jj < 1:7 is achieved using steel absorbers and scintillating tiles as the active medium. Liquid argon calorimetry with copper absorbers is employed in the hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which cover the region 1:5 < jj < 3:2.",

Processes with a top quark are simulated with MC@NLO [27,28]. The t \" t cross section used is the HATHOR [29] approximate NNLO value, while MC@NLO [28] values are used for the single top processes. HERWIG [30] models the contribution of diboson events, with the cross sections set by the MCFM [31] NLO predictions. The remaining W=Z \u00fe jet\u00f0s\u00de backgrounds are simulated with ALPGEN, and normalized using single vector boson production NNLO cross sections [25]. The multijet background is estimated using a data sample with both electron candidates passing loose criteria [18] but failing the slightly tighter medium criteria. This sample is normalized to the difference in the inclusive Z sample between the data and all other backgrounds in the region 50 < m ee < 65 GeV.

Figure 2 presents the e \u00fe e \u00c0 invariant mass distribution in this sample and the SM prediction, before imposing the jm ee \u00c0 m Z j < 15 GeV requirement. The accurate modeling of the mass distribution for values beyond the Z boson mass supports the prediction of t \" t and Other SM background events. Within the window around the Z boson mass, ALPGEN and SHERPA agree to within 1% and 7% in the prediction of the number of Z \u00fe light and Z \u00fe charm events, respectively. However, ALPGEN and SHERPA disagree in the prediction of the Z \u00fe bottom contribution, a fact previously reported in an ATLAS cross section measurement of Z bosons produced in association with b jets using a smaller dataset [24]. The ALPGEN and SHERPA Z \u00fe bottom predictions are scaled to account for the difference between data and all other predicted backgrounds in a subsample of the Z\u00fe ! 1 b jet sample that contains events failing the requirement discussed below on the transverse momentum of the b 0 candidate. The scale factors are consistent with those measured in Ref. [24], and the invariant mass distribution of secondary vertex tracks is used to confirm the validity of the resulting prediction for the flavor composition in the Z\u00fe ! 1 b jet sample [24]. Simulated b 0 \" b 0 events are generated for a range of b 0 masses using MADGRAPH [33] with the G4LHC extension [6]. PYTHIA  [34] performs fragmentation and hadronization of the parton-level events. The signal cross sections are obtained with HATHOR [29], and vary from 80 pb to 30 fb over the range m b 0 \u00bc 200-700 GeV. In each sample, one b 0 decays in the mode b 0 ! Z \u00fe b, with the Z boson decaying via Z ! e \u00fe e \u00c0 . Two separate samples are produced for each mass value, with the other b 0 decaying either via b 0 ! Z \u00fe b or b 0 ! W \u00fe t, and with all decay modes of the Z and W bosons allowed. The factor \u00bc 2 \u00c2 BR\u00f0b 0 ! Zb\u00de \u00c0 BR\u00f0b 0 ! Zb\u00de 2 characterizes the fraction of signal events with at least one b 0 ! Z \u00fe b decay as a function of the branching ratio. The case \u00bc 1 is equivalent to previous measurements [9] which assumed BR\u00f0b 0 ! Zb\u00de \u00bc 1. The case of a vectorlike singlet (VLS) mixing solely with the third SM generation is also considered by computing as a function of the b 0 mass [5]. Over the range m b 0 \u00bc 200-700 GeV, varies from 0.9 to 0.5. A SM Higgs of mass 125 GeV is assumed. TABLE I. Number of predicted and observed events at three stages in the event selection. The contributions from SM backgrounds are shown individually, as well as combined into the total SM prediction. The uncertainties on the predicted number of events combine all sources of uncertainty.

The fractional uncertainty on the total number of background events passing the p T \u00f0Zb\u00de > 150 GeV requirement is 27%. Significant contributions arise from uncertainties in the p T \u00f0Zb\u00de distribution shape in Z \u00fe jet\u00f0s\u00de events. Such sources of uncertainty include the renormalization and factorization scale choice (14%, evaluated using MCFM [36]), shape differences observed between ALPGEN and SHERPA (12%), and variations in the degree of initial and final state QCD radiation (9%). The uncertainty in the efficiency of the b-tagging requirement contributes an additional 12%. Other sources of uncertainty contributing at the level of 6% or less include the jet energy scale [20], parton distribution functions (PDF), MC sample sizes, electron identification efficiency, Z boson cross section, luminosity, b jet mistag rate, t \" t cross section, jet energy resolution, trigger efficiency, and the Other SM event yield. Most of the above uncertainties, with the notable exception of the p T \u00f0Zb\u00de modeling uncertainties in Z \u00fe jet\u00f0s\u00de events, contribute to the total uncertainty on the signal normalization, which varies between 11% and 14% depending on the b 0 mass. Figure 4 presents the b 0 candidate mass distribution after requiring p T \u00f0Zb\u00de > 150 GeV and the predicted SM background. The distributions for the signal scenarios depicted in Fig. 3 are shown overlaid. The data are in agreement with the SM prediction over the full range of m\u00f0Zb\u00de values. In the absence of evidence of an enhancement, 95% confidence level (C.L.) cross section exclusion limits are derived. Figure 5 presents the expected and observed cross section limits as a function of m b 0 , computed under the assumption \u00bc 1. The expected cross section limit was checked to be stable to within 15% over the full mass range considered using the signal samples in which one b 0 quark b 0 cross section prediction is shown multiplied by \u00bc 1, as well as by the VLS value, with the shaded region representing the total uncertainty arising from PDF uncertainties and the factorization and renormalization scale choice. From the intersection of the observed cross section limit and the theoretical prediction, b 0 quarks with masses m b 0 < 400 GeV decaying entirely via b 0 !
