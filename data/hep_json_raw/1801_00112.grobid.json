Photons are required to have transverse energies above 125 GeV. Jets are identified using the anti-kt algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 and required to have transverse momenta above 100 GeV. Measurements of isolated-photon plus jet cross sections are presented as functions of the leading-photon transverse energy, the leading-jet transverse momentum, the azimuthal angular separation between the photon and the jet, the photon-jet invariant mass and the scattering angle in the photon-jet centre-of-mass system. Tree-level plus parton-shower predictions from Sherpa and Pythia as well as next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from Jetphox and Sherpa are compared to the measurements.",

In pp collisions, all photons that are not secondaries from hadron decays are considered to be \"prompt\". The measurements of angular correlations between the photon and the jet can be used to probe the dynamics of the hard-scattering process. The dominant source in pp collisions at the LHC is the qg \u2192 q\u03b3 process. These measurements are also useful for tuning Monte Carlo (MC) models and testing t -channel quark exchange [1,2]. Furthermore, precise measurements of these processes validate the generators used for background studies in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model which involve photons, such as the search for new phenomena in final states with a photon and a jet [3,4].",

The variable \u03b8 * coin cides with the scattering polar angle in the centre-of-mass frame for collinear scattering of massless particles, and its distribution is sensitive to the spin of the exchanged particle. For processes dom-inated by t -channel gluon exchange, such as dijet production in pp collisions, the differential cross section behaves as (1 -| cos\u03b8 * |)-2 when | cos\u03b8 * | \u2192 1. In contrast, processes dominated by t-channel quark exchange are expected to exhibit a (1 -| cos\u03b8 * |)-1 be haviour when | cos\u03b8 * | \u2192 1. This fundamental prediction of QCD can be tested in photon plus jet production in pp collisions. The direct-photon contribution, dominated by t -channel quark ex change, is expected to exhibit a (1 -| cos\u03b8 * |)-1 dependence when | cos \u03b8 * | \u2192 1, whereas that of fragmentation processes is predicted to be the same as in dijet production, namely (1 -| cos\u03b8 * |)-2. For both processes, there are also s-channel contributions which are, however, non-singular when | cos\u03b8 * | \u2192 1. As a result, a measure ment of the cross section for prompt-photon plus jet production as a function of | cos\u03b8 * | provides a handle on the relative contri butions of the direct and fragmentation components as well as the possibility of testing the dominance of t -channel quark exchange.",

It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The inner-detector system is immersed in a 2T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2 . 5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector is closest to the interaction region and provides four measurements per track; the innermost layer, known as the insertable B-layer [16], provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking perfor mance. The pixel detector is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which typically provides four three-dimensional space point measurements per track. These silicon detectors are comple mented by the transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0. The calorimeter system covers the range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by barrel and end cap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) EM calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters; for |\u03b7| < 2.5 the EM calorimeter is divided into three layers in depth. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, seg mented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters, which cover the re gion 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The solid-angle coverage is completed out to |\u03b7| = 4.9 with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are optimised for EM and hadronic measurements, respectively. Events are selected using a first-level trigger imple mented in custom electronics, which reduces the maximum event rate of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz using a subset of detector information. Software algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 1kHz [17].",

In both generators, the partonic processes were simulated using tree-level matrix elements, with the inclusion of initialand final-state par ton showers. Fragmentation into hadrons was performed using the Lund string model [19] in the case of Pythia, and in Sherpa by a modified version of the cluster model [20]. The LO NNPDF2.3 [21] parton distribution functions (PDF) set was used for Pythia while the NLO CT10 [22] PDF set was used for Sherpa to parameterise the proton structure. Both samples include a simulation of the underlying event (UE). The event-generator parameters were set according to the ATLAS 2014 tune series (A14 tune) for Pythia [23] and to the tune developed in conjunction with the NLO CT10 PDF set for Sherpa. The Pythia simulation of the signal includes LO photon-plus-jet events from both direct processes (the hard sub processes qg \u2192 q\u03b3 and qq\u00af \u2192 g \u03b3 , called the \"hard\" component) and photon bremsstrahlung in LO QCD dijet events (called the \"bremsstrahlung\" component). The bremsstrahlung component is modelled by final-state QED radiation arising from calculations of all 2 \u2192 2QCD processes. In the particle-level phase space of the presented measurements the fraction of the bremsstrahlung com ponent decreases from 35% at E T \u03b3 = 125 GeV to 15% at E T \u03b3 = 1TeV. The Sherpa samples were generated with LO matrix ele ments for photon-plus-jet final states with up to three additional partons (2 \u2192 n processes with n from 2to 5); the matrix el ements were merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@LO prescription [24]. The bremsstrahlung component is accounted for in Sherpa through the matrix elements of 2 \u2192 n processes with n \u2265 3. In the generation of the Sherpa samples, a requirement on the photon isolation at the matrix-element level was imposed using the criterion defined in Ref. [25]. This criterion, commonly called Frixione's criterion, requires the total transverse energy inside a cone of size V around the generated final-state photon, excluding the photon itself, to be below a certain thresh old, ET max( All the samples of generated events were passed through the Geant4-based [26] ATLAS detector and trigger full simulation pro grams [27]. They are reconstructed and analysed with the same program chain as the data. Pile-up from additional pp collisions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings was simulated by overlaying each MC event with a variable number of simulated in elastic pp collisions generated using Pythia 8.153 with the ATLAS set of tuned parameters for minimum bias events (A2 tune) [28]. The MC events are weighted to reproduce the distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing (^\u03bc^) observed in the data, referred to as \"pile-up reweighting\". In this procedure, the ^\u03bc^ value from the data is divided by a factor of 1.16 \u00b1 0.07, a rescaling which makes the number of reconstructed primary ver tices agree better between data and simulation and reproduces the visible cross section of inelastic pp collisions as measured in the data [29].",

The measurement of the photon energy is based on the energy collected in calorimeter cells in an area of size ^\u03b7 \u00d7 ^\u03c6 = 0.075 \u00d7 0.175 in the barrel and 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 in the endcaps. A dedicated energy calibration [31] is then ap plied to the candidates to account for upstream energy loss and both lateral and longitudinal leakage. The photon identification is based primarily on shower shapes in the calorimeter [30]. An ini tial selection is derived using the information from the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral shower shape in the second layer of the EM calorimeter, where most of the photon energy is contained. The final tight selection applies stringent criteria [30] to the same variables used in the initial selection, separately for converted and unconverted photon candidates. It also places requirements on the shower shape in the finely segmented first calorimeter layer to en sure the compatibility of the measured shower profile with that originating from a single photon impacting the calorimeter. When applying the photon identification criteria to simulated events, cor rections are made for small differences in the average values of the shower-shape variables between data and simulation. Events with at least one photon candidate with calibrated E T \u03b3 > 125 GeV, where the trigger is maximally efficient, and |\u03b7\u03b3 | < 2.37 are se lected. Candidates in the region 1.37 < |\u03b7\u03b3| < 1.56, which includes the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters, are not considered. The photon candidate is required to be iso lated based on the amount of transverse energy inside a cone of size ^ R = 0.4in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane around the photon candidate, ex cluding an area of size ^\u03b7 \u00d7 ^\u03c6 = 0.125 \u00d7 0.175 centred on the photon. The isolation transverse energy is computed from topo logical clusters of calorimeter cells [32] and is denoted by E i Tso.",

The measured value of E i Tso is corrected for the expected leakage of the photon energy into the isolation cone as well as for the estimated contributions from the UE and pile-up [33,34]. The corrections for pile-up and the UE are com puted simultaneously on an event-by-event basis using the jet-area method [35,36] as follows: the k\u22a5 jet algorithm [37,38] with jet ra dius R = 0.5is used to reconstruct all jets, taking topological clus ters of calorimeter cells as input; no explicit transverse momentum threshold is applied. The ambient transverse energy density for the event (\u03c1 ), from pile-up and the UE, is computed using the median of the distribution of the ratio of the jet's transverse en ergy to its area. Finally, \u03c1 is multiplied by the area of the isolation cone to compute the correction to E i Tso. The combined correction is typically 2 GeV and depends weakly on E T \u03b3 . In addition, for simu lated events, data-driven corrections to E T iso are applied such that the peak position in the E T iso distribution coincides in data and simulation. After all these corrections, E T iso is required to be less than ET is,ocut \u2261 4.2 \u2022 10-3 \u2022 E T \u03b3 + 4.8 GeV [39]. The isolation require ment significantly reduces the main background, which consists of multi-jet events where one jet typically contains a \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 me son that carries most of the jet energy and is misidentified as a photon because it decays into an almost collinear photon pair. A small fraction of the events contain more than one photon candi date satisfying the selection criteria. In such events, the highest-E T \u03b3 (leading) photon is considered for further study.",

The calorimeter cell energies are measured at the EM scale, cor responding to the energy deposited by electromagnetically inter acting particles. The jet four-momenta are computed from the sum of the jet-constituent four-momenta, treating each as a four-vector with zero mass. The jets are then further calibrated using the method described in Ref. [42] and these jets are referred to as detector-level jets. The four-momentum of each jet is recalculated to point to the selected primary vertex of the event rather than the centre of the detector. The contribution from the UE and pile-up is then subtracted on a jet-by-jet basis using the jet-area method. A jet-energy calibration is derived from MC simulations as a cor rection relating the calorimeter response to the true jet energy. To determine these corrections, the jet reconstruction procedure ap plied to the topological clusters is also applied to the generated stable particles, which are defined as those with a decay length of c\u03c4 > 10 mm, excluding muons and neutrinos; these jets are referred to as particle-level jets. In addition, sequential jet correc tions, derived from MC simulated events and using global prop erties of the jet such as tracking information, calorimeter energy deposits and muon spectrometer information, are applied [43]. Fi nally, the detector-level jets are further calibrated with additional correction factors derived in situ from a combination of \u03b3 + jet, Z + jet and multi-jet p T balance methods [44,45]. 2 Jets reconstructed from calorimeter signals not originating from a pp collision are rejected by applying jet-quality criteria [45,46]. These criteria suppress spurious jets from electronic noise in the calorimeter, cosmic rays and beam-related backgrounds. Remain ing jets are required to have calibrated transverse momenta greater than 60 GeV and rapidity | yjet| < 2.37. Jets overlapping with the candidate photon are not considered if the jet axis lies within a cone of size ^ R = 0.8 around the photon candidate; this re quirement prevents any overlap between the photon isolation cone (^R = 0.4) and the jet cone (^ R = 0.4). Finally, the event is re tained if the jet with highest transverse energy (leading jet) has pj Tet > 100 GeV.",

The difference in normalisation between data and Pythia (LO Sherpa) is \u223c+10% (+40%) and attributed to the fact that these generators are based on tree-level matrix elements, which are affected by a large normalisation uncertainty due to missing higher-order terms; for this reason, the theoretical uncertainties are not included in Fig. 3. Both predictions give an adequate de scription of the shape of the measured d\u03c3 /d ET \u03b3 , although Pythia is slightly better than LO Sherpa for ET \u03b3 ^ 600 GeV. For d\u03c3 /dpj Tet-lead, the prediction from LO Sherpa gives an adequate description of the data in the whole measured range, whereas that from Pythia overestimates the data for p j Tet-lead ^ 200 GeV; the overestimation is attributed to a large contribution from photon bremsstrahlung predicted by the tune used in Pythia (see Section 3).

Equation (1) takes into account the expected num ber of signal events in each of the three background control re gions (Ns Kig) via the signal leakage fractions, f K = Ns Kig/Ns Aig with K = B, C, D, which are estimated using the MC simulations of the signal. The only assumption underlying Eq. (1)is that the isolation and identification variables are uncorrelated for background events, thus R bg = 1. This assumption is verified in data typically within \u00b110% in validation regions,5 which are dominated by background. Deviations of R bg from unity in the validation regions, after ac counting for signal leakage using either the Pythia or LO Sherpa simulations, are propagated through Eq. (1) and taken as system atic uncertainties. The signal purity, defined as Ns Aig/N A, is above 90% in all bins of the measured distributions. The use of Pythia",
