            "text": "The differential cross section for production of charged hadrons with high transverse momenta in scattering of 160 GeV/c muons off nucleons at low photon virtualities has been measured at the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The results, which cover transverse momenta from 1.1 GeV/c to 3.6 GeV/c, are compared to a perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation, in order to evaluate the applicability of pQCD to this process in the kinematic domain of the experiment. The shape of the calculated differential cross section as a function of transverse momentum is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data, but the absolute scale is underestimated by next-toleading order (NLO) pQCD. The inclusion of all-order resummation of large logarithmic threshold corrections reduces the discrepancy from a factor of three to four to a factor of two. The dependence of the cross section on the pseudo-rapidity and on virtual photon energy fraction is investigated. Finally the dependence on the charge of the hadrons is discussed.",

            "text": "Most of the current knowledge about the structure of the nucleon has been derived from high-energy lepton-nucleon scattering experiments (see e.g. Ref. [1]). The theoretical framework for the interpretation of data from such experiments is perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). In the presence of a large momentum transfer in the reaction, pQCD relies on the collinear factorization of the cross section into non-perturbative collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), hard partonic scattering cross sections calculable in perturbation theory, and non-perturbative collinear fragmentation functions (FFs) [2]. This paper discusses the measurement of the cross section for production of charged hadrons (h \u00b1 ) with high transverse momenta p T in muon-nucleon (\u00b5-N) scattering at low photon virtualities, \u00b5N \u2192 \u00b5 h \u00b1 X. In the pQCD framework, the lowest-order contributions to this reaction are (i) photongluon fusion (PGF), in which a virtual photon emitted by the lepton interacts with a gluon inside the nucleon via the formation of a quark-antiquark pair, \u03b3g \u2192 qq, (ii) QCD Compton (QCDC) scattering, in which the photon interacts with a quark in the nucleon leading to the emission of a hard gluon, \u03b3q \u2192 qg, and (iii) numerous resolved-photon processes.",

            "text": "The comparison of the calculated cross section to the experimentally measured one is sensitive to the accuracy with which the partonic cross section can be calculated in perturbation theory, as well as to the validity of collinear factorization itself, i.e. to soft non-perturbative contributions to the production of high-p T hadrons. For inclusive high-p T hadron or jet production in proton-proton (p-p) scattering, cross sections have been measured at FNAL [3][4][5], CERN [6] and BNL [7][8][9][10][11][12] at center-of-mass system (CMS) energies \u221a s pp from 20 GeV to 200 GeV. The comparison of these data to next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations [13] shows that while there is good agreement at \u221a s pp = 200 GeV (RHIC), the theory increasingly underestimates the cross sections with decreasing \u221a s pp . The disagreement reaches up to an order of magnitude at 20 GeV. These discrepancies can be reconciled by the inclusion of allorder resummations of threshold logarithms [14], which are related to soft gluon emissions and are usually performed up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy.",

            "text": "The electromagnetic probe in muon-lepton scattering has the advantage over p-p scattering that the kinematics of the reaction is better known since the momentum and energy transfers to the nucleon can be measured for each event by analyzing the scattered lepton. In the regime of quasi-real photoproduction, i.e. at low photon virtualities Q 2 , the cross section for high-p T hadron production in lepton-nucleon scattering can be calculated in NLO pQCD via the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams formalism [15,16]. For dijet production at HERA at very high photon-nucleon CMS energies 142 \u2264 W \u03b3N \u2264 293 GeV, the NLO pQCD results agree well with the experimental data [17]. At the energy of fixed-target experiments, such a check of the applicability of pQCD to high-p T particle production at low Q 2 has not been done yet. The cross section for high-p T hadron production in the scattering of 28 GeV/c positrons off nucleons has been published by the HERMES Collaboration [18]. However, the measurement hardly exceeds p T values of 2 GeV/c, which sets rather low factorization and renormalization scales for pQCD calculations, and a comparison to NLO pQCD was not attempted. A new measurement of the cross section for production of unidentified charged hadrons with high p T in scattering of 160 GeV/c muons off nucleons (CMS energy \u221a s \u00b5N = 17.4 GeV) at the COMPASS experiment [19] at low photon virtualities is described in the present paper. The cross section for this kinematic domain has been calculated in NLO pQCD [20,21]. Recently, the all-order resummation of threshold corrections up to NLL accuracy has been included in these calculations [22].",

In the experiment a naturally-polarized 160 GeV/c \u00b5 + -beam scatters off a polarized, isoscalar target that consists of granulated 6 LiD immersed in liquid helium. The small admixtures of H, 3 He, and 7 Li lead to an excess of neutrons of about 0.1%. The target is arranged in two oppositely polarized 60 cm long cells. The unpolarized cross section is obtained by averaging over the target polarizations. Since the azimuthal angles of the produced hadrons are integrated over, the cross section does not depend on the beam polarization. The integrated luminosity is determined via the direct measurement of the rate of beam muons crossing the target and is found to be equal to 142 pb \u22121 \u00b1 10%(syst.) after correction for the dead times of the veto and data acquisition systems. As an independent cross check of the luminosity, the structure function of the nucleon F 2 is determined from this data set and compared to the NMC parametrization of F 2 [23] yielding satisfactory agreement [24]. The analysis is based on high-p T events that were recorded by the quasi-real photoproduction trigger systems [25]. These triggers are based on the coincidence between the detection of the scattered muon at low scattering angles and an energy deposit exceeding about 5 GeV in one of the two hadronic calorimeters, to suppress background from muon-electron scattering and radiative elastic or quasi-elastic muon-scattering events. Events are accepted if the photon virtuality Q 2 < 0.1 (GeV/c) 2 and if the fractional energy transferred from the incident muon to the virtual photon is in the range 0.2 \u2264 y \u2264 0.8, where the acceptance of the trigger systems is largest. These selections result in the energy range 7.8 \u2264 W \u03b3N \u2264 15.5 GeV. The fraction of the virtual-photon energy transferred to the hadron h \u00b1 is constrained by 0.2 \u2264 z \u2264 0.8. Moreover, hadrons are required to have momenta p \u2265 15 GeV/c to ensure full trigger efficiency. The angle of the hadron with respect to the direction of the virtual photon has to be in the range 10 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 120 mrad, which corresponds to a range of \u00b5-N CMS pseudo-rapidities 2.4 \u2265 \u03b7 CMS \u2265 \u22120.1. In addition to these kinematic criteria, the selection of reconstructed hadrons is subject to several geometrical cuts: the positions of the muon-scattering vertices are limited to the fiducial target volume, the hadron tracks must not cross the solenoid magnet of the polarized target, and the hadron tracks must hit one of the two hadronic calorimeters, excluding 3 cm wide margins around the edges (for full trigger efficiency).",

This separation is performed by the vertex-reconstruction algorithm, which is however impaired by the fact that the angle between the incoming and outgoing muon tracks is very small at low Q 2 . The background contamination can not be estimated directly from the MC data, because simulations with the two hadron-shower models available in GEANT3 (GHEISHA and FLUKA) give inconsistent results. Hence the background contribution is determined in each p T bin from the experimental data by fitting the shape of the distribution of position differences between two-particle vertices formed by the incoming muon track and the outgoing muon track on the one hand, and the incoming muon track and the outgoing hadron track on the other hand [28]. The distribution for signal hadrons, originating from the same interaction as the outgoing muon track, has a symmetric shape, while for background hadrons there is a characteristic asymmetric shape. The results of these fits show that the background contribution to the experimental data is consistent with zero. However, cross checks with both MC hadron-shower models indicate that the background contribution can be systematically underestimated by 6% using this method. In addition, the described procedure is statistically limited for the highest p T bins because there are too few entries in the vertex-difference distributions to exclude a non-zero background contribution with high statistical accuracy. For the four highest p T bins, the background level p excl at which a nonzero background contribution can be excluded at 90% confidence level is greater than 6%. Therefore, the possible contribution of residual background to the hadron yield is conservatively estimated to be 2 \u00d7 6% for the six lowest p T bins and p excl + 6% for the four highest p T bins. These values are used as systematic uncertainties of the acceptance factors.",

(1) are drawn, are calculated using the method of Lafferty & Wyatt [32] and are denoted by p T lw in Table 1. The cross section drops by about four orders of magnitude over the measured p T range. The only apparent deviation from an exponential shape is a slight hardening of the spectrum at about p T = 2.5 GeV/c. In Fig. 1, the data are compared to an NLO pQCD calculation. The method of the calculation is first described in Ref. [20], and has been updated [21] to implement the kinematic selections presented in Section 2 and the DSS FFs [33] for unidentified charged hadrons. Recently, the resummation of large logarithmic thresholds to all orders [22] has been included. The three curves correspond to different choices of the renormalization (\u00b5 r ) and factorization (\u00b5 f ) scales in the pQCD calculation. The standard choice for the scales in pQCD is \u00b5 = \u00b5 r = \u00b5 f = p T and the scale uncertainty is estimated by varying the scale in the range p T /2 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 2p T . The theoretical values are given only for p T \u2265 1.75 GeV/c in order to ensure the applicability of perturbative methods. At the standard scale \u00b5 = p T , the resummed result underestimates the experimental cross section by a factor of about two, but follows the shape of the differential cross section remarkably well, as can be seen in Fig. 1 (bottom panel), which shows the ratio of the measured over the calculated cross sections. Analogous to p-p scattering at low CMS energies [13,14], the all-order resummation of threshold logarithms is found to significantly reduce the normalization discrepancy compared to the fixed-order NLO result [21], which underestimated the experimental cross section by a factor of three to four. The large scale uncertainty of the theoretical cross section, however, shows that higher-order contributions are likely to Table 1: Measured cross section for high-p T hadron production in \u00b5-N scattering at \u221a s \u00b5N = 17.4 GeV. The cross section is integrated over the full kinematic range defined in the text. The columns show: (1) p T range of the bin; (2) p T value of data point in Fig. 1; (3) differential cross section summed over hadron charges (please note that there is an additional 10% normalization uncertainty from luminosity); and (4) charge ratio of the cross section. be significant in the pQCD framework.",

            "text": "The ratio of the cross sections for the production of negatively over positively charged hadrons (charge ratio), displayed in Fig. 4 as a function of p T , is found to be significantly smaller than unity, showing that the production of positive hadrons is preferred. No strong p T dependence is observed within the statistical accuracy of the measurement. It is worth to note that most of the systematic uncertainties as well as the normalization uncertainty are expected to cancel out in the charge ratio. The ratio is sensitive to the contributions of the different partonic processes to the cross section. The QCDC process can lead to an excess of positively charged hadrons because the electromagnetic coupling to u quarks is four times larger than to d quarks, and u quarks are more likely to produce positively charged mesons. The PGF process, on the other hand, is not expected to result in a charge asymmetry, assuming independent quark fragmentation. The resummed pQCD calculation, also shown in Fig. 4, features a charge ratio of about unity for the lowest p T values, in disagreement with the data, and a clear decrease with increasing  p T . It should be noted, however, that the scale uncertainty bands were obtained simply by dividing the calculated h \u2212 and h + cross sections for a given scale, and thus may underestimate the true scale uncertainty [22].",

            "text": "In summary, the single-inclusive cross section for charged-hadron production in \u00b5-N scattering at \u221a s \u00b5N = 17.4 GeV was measured for photon virtualities Q 2 < 0.1 (GeV/c) 2 in the \u03b7 CMS interval between \u22120.1 and 2.4 and for transverse hadron momenta up to 3.6 GeV/c. The measured p T -differential cross section is compared with pQCD calculations. Without the all-order resummation of threshold logarithms, the pQCD calculation at NLO appears to be insufficient to fully describe high-p T hadron production in \u00b5-N scattering at low Q 2 in the kinematic domain of COMPASS. The resummation helps to resolve this dis-crepancy at least partly. At a renormalization and factorization scale corresponding to p T , the calculation reproduces the shape of the measured cross section over the full rapidity range, but underestimates the experimental cross section by about a factor of two, independent of p T . Due to the low values of p T and \u221a s \u00b5N , however, the theory still shows a rather large scale dependence, with an uncertainty band which overlaps with the experimental data. The ratio of the measured cross section and the calculated one is found to depend only weakly on the photon fractional energy y, indicating that the resummation procedure correctly takes into account corrections due to the emission of soft gluons. The ratio of cross sections for the production of negative over positive hadrons is found to be always smaller than unity in the full p T range under investigation, with no strong dependence on p T . This is in contrast to the theory, which shows a ratio close to unity for low p T values.",

This approach is complementary to previous measurements of the gluon polarization by COMPASS using spin-dependent, high-p T hadron-pair production [34,35], which employ the MC generators PYTHIA and LEPTO [36], respectively, to quantify the contribution of PGF to the cross section.",
