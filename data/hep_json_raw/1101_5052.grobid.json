After having recorded an unprecedented sample of \u223c 550 millions of BB pairs, the Belle collaboration started to record collisions at higher energies, opening the possibility to study the B 0 s meson. A significant theoretical effort on the B 0 s potential for studying CP violation in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond has taken place from the 90's [3]. The non-flavor specific decays such as B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 are expected to be insensitive to new physics (NP); they can be used to measure the CKM angle \u03b3 [4] and help to resolve the ambiguity in the width difference in the B 0 s \u2212B 0 s system, \u2206\u0393 s [5]. The penguin-dominated decays B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 are expected to be sensitive to NP [6] and the CKM angles \u03b2 and \u03b3 can be extracted by comparing its branching fraction (BF) with that of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [7]. Finally, the decays involving a b \u2192 ccs transition (the \"golden mode\" B 0",

The J/\u03c8 candidates are formed with oppositely-charged electron or muon pairs, while \u03b7 candidates are reconstructed via the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 modes. A mass (mass and vertex) constrained fit is then applied to the \u03b7 (J/\u03c8) candidates. The \u03b7 candidates are reconstructed via the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 modes, while the \u03c1 0 candidates are selected from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs. If more than one candidate per event satisfies all the selection criteria, the one with the smallest fit residual is selected. The main background is the continuum, which is reduced by requiring R 2 < 0.4. The combined M bc and \u2206E distributions are presented in Figs. 5 (B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7) and 6 (B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7 ). We obtain B(B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7) = (3.32 \u00b1 0.87(stat.) +0.32 \u22120.28 (syst.) \u00b1 0.42(f s )) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b7 ) = (3.1 \u00b1 1.2(stat.) +0. 5 \u22120.6 (syst.) \u00b1 0.4(f s )) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This is, respectively, the first observation (7.3\u03c3) and the first evidence (3.8\u03c3) for these modes.  The B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 f 0 (980) mode is especially interesting for the hadron-collider experiments because it has only four charged tracks in its final state.
