            "text": "The measurement of the top-quark pair production cross section is an important part of the physics program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. As the top quark is the heaviest known fermion, it has the largest coupling to the recently discovered Higgs boson and plays a special role in many theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). New physics may result in additional top-quark decay channels or new mechanisms of tt production that can cause the measured cross section to deviate from the SM prediction. Also, tt production is the dominant background to many searches for new physics.",

            "text": "The inclusive pp \u2192 tt cross section \u03c3 tt at a center-ofmass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV has been calculated to be 253 \u00fe13 \u221215 pb for a top-quark mass of m top \u00bc 172.5 GeV. These calculations were performed at next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) in QCD including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms using the program TOP++ 2.0 [2][3][4][5][6][7]. In these calculations, the renormalization scale \u03bc R and factorization scale \u03bc F were both set equal to m top . The NNLO \u00fe NNLL value was found to be about 3% larger than the NNLO-only calculation as implemented in HATHOR 1.5 [8]. As a result of recent progress in theoretical calculations, the tt production cross section has been evaluated with uncertainties below 6%. In calculating these uncertainties, the scale uncertainty, evaluated by independent variations of \u03bc R and \u03bc F by factors of 1=2 and 2, was combined in quadrature with uncertainties on the coupling strength of the strong interaction, \u03b1 S , and the parton distribution functions (PDFs). The latter were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [9] with MSTW2008 NNLO (at the 68% confidence level) [10,11], CT10 NNLO [12,13] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [14] PDF sets.",

The present analysis aims to measure the tt production cross section in the lepton \u00fe jets final state, where one of the W bosons decays into an electron or a muon (collectively called a lepton and denoted l) and a corresponding neutrino (including the W \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd e and W \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd \u03bc decays), and the other W boson decays hadronically. The final state is characterized by the presence of a highly energetic isolated lepton, large missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) due to the neutrino(s) escaping detection, and four jets due to the two b quarks from the top-quark decays and the two quarks from the hadronic W decay. The selected events are required to have at least three jets, allowing one jet to be undetected due to limited detector acceptance and jet reconstruction inefficiency. At least one of the jets is further required to be identified as a b jet.",

This paper presents the measurement of the tt production cross section of the ATLAS Collaboration in the lepton \u00fe jets channel, which provides a cross-check of the dilepton measurement that has different background conditions and systematic uncertainties, and contributes to the combined tt production cross-section result. In addition, the measurement in the lepton \u00fe jets channel is important for probing the presence of new physics that changes the top-quark decay branching fractions, e.g. production of charged Higgs bosons H \u00fe via t \u2192 H \u00fe b decays.",

After these steps, the events were required to have exactly one lepton (an electron or a muon) selected as above and matched to the trigger object that caused the event to be selected, and at least three jets, of which at least one was b tagged. Events with a second lepton with p T > 25 GeV were discarded. 3 Finally, the events had to exceed minimum values for the W transverse mass m T \u00f0W\u00de and the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum E miss T . The value of E miss T in the tt \u2192 l\u03bd \u00fe jets process is relatively large due to neutrino(s) from W decays. It also includes energy losses due to detector inefficiencies as well as energy fluctuations in jet measurements. The missing transverse momentum value is calculated as the negative of the vector sum over the energies of all clusters in the calorimeters, and E miss T is refined by the application of the object-level corrections for the contributions arising from identified electrons, muons, and jets.
