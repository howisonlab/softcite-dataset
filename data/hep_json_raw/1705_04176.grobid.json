These measurements aim to assess the collective nature of particle production. The measurements of multi-particle cumulants confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in p + Pb and low-multiplicity Pb + Pb collisions. On the other hand, the pp results for fourparticle cumulants do not demonstrate collective behaviour, indicating that they may be biased by contributions from nonflow correlations. A comparison of multi-particle cumulants and derived Fourier harmonics across different collision systems is presented as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. For a given multiplicity, the measured Fourier harmonics are largest in Pb + Pb, smaller in p + Pb and smallest in pp collisions. The pp results show no dependence on the collision energy, nor on the multiplicity.",

This anisotropy results from spatial asymmetry in the initial interaction region in off-centre ion-ion collisions. The initial asymmetry activates strong pressure gradients along the shorter axis of the overlap region, leading to increased production of particles within the reaction plane, defined by the impact parameter vector (the vector separation of the barycentres of the two nuclei) and the beam axis. The azimuthal anisotropy is commonly characterized by Fourier harmonics v n , referred to as single-particle harmonic flow coefficients: v n = cos[n(\u03c6 \u2212 R )] , where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of a produced particle e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch and R is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane [1]. This anisotropic, collective enhancement of particle production is a global long-range phenomenon extending over a wide pseudorapidity range.",

            "text": "The anisotropy of charged-particle azimuthal angle distributions in A + A collisions has been a subject of extensive experimental studies at RHIC [2][3][4][5][6][7] and at the LHC [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the large and dominating v 2 coefficient is mainly associated with the elliptic shape of the nuclear overlap. The v 2 coefficient in ultra-central collisions and other v n coefficients in all collisions are related to various geometric configurations arising from fluctuations of the nucleon positions in the overlap region [23,24]. The reported results are consistent with model calculations based on a hydrodynamic description of the system evolution and provide conclusive evidence that the hot and dense matter produced in A + A collisions behaves collectively in accordance with a hydrodynamic flow and has properties resembling those of a nearly perfect fluid [25][26][27][28].",

Therefore, it might be expected that the collective flow, if any, generated in p + A collisions is much weaker than in heavyion interactions. Contrary to these expectations, significant v n coefficients, only about 40% smaller in magnitude than those obtained in Pb + Pb collisions, have been measured in p + Pb collisions at the LHC energy of \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38].

            "text": "Interestingly, long-range two-particle azimuthal correlations have also been observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies [42][43][44][45][46]. It was found that the measured azimuthal correlations, which extend over a wide range in pseudorapidity, can be explained by the cos(n\u03c6) modulation of the single-particle azimuthal angle distribution. The extracted Fourier harmonics v n for n = 2-4 [46] are generally much smaller than those measured in p + Pb and Pb + Pb collisions, and show no dependency on the chargedparticle multiplicity. On the other hand, they display a similar dependence on particle transverse momenta, suggesting that the same underlying mechanism may be responsible for the long-range azimuthal correlations. These observations in pp collisions, together with the results from the p + A system described above, are among the most challenging and pressing problems in the domain of soft quantum chromodynamics. Various models have been proposed to explain the source of the observed long-range correlations in small collision systems [47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63], but the origin of the effect is still under intense debate. It is not yet known whether the mechanism responsible for the observed collective behaviour in A + A collisions is also relevant for the smaller systems. The main purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by providing new experimental results.",

They differ principally in their sensitivity to correlations not related to the initial collision geometry (referred to as non-flow correlations), which can result from resonance decays, jet production, Bose-Einstein correlations or energy-momentum conservation. For small collision systems and low-multiplicity final states, the most common method uses two-particle correlation functions [29][30][31]33,[35][36][37][38][42][43][44][45][46]64]. In this method, the non-flow correlations are suppressed by requiring a large pseudorapidity separation, | \u03b7|, between particles forming a pair. This requirement eliminates most of the shortrange correlations including intra-jet correlations. The jet-jet correlations are subtracted from the two-particle correlation function using the correlations measured in low-multiplicity events (see e.g. [43,46]).",

            "text": "The multi-particle cumulant method [65][66][67] was proposed to suppress the non-flow correlations. The method aims to measure correlations between a large number of particles, from which the correlations between a small number of particles are subtracted. Since non-flow correlations typically involve a low number of particles, they are suppressed in many-particle cumulants. The drawback of the method is the statistical limitation in calculating the cumulants of more than two particles. Furthermore, the multi-particle cumulants in small collision systems, derived from correlations between low number of particles, can be biased by non-flow jet and dijet correlations, which dominate the azimuthal correlation signal. The cumulant method has been applied to measure global correlations and Fourier harmonics in Pb + Pb and p + Pb collisions [18,20,32,33,36]. Recently, the four-and six-particle cumulants were also measured by the CMS Collaboration in pp collisions at 5, 7 and 13 TeV [45].",

The ID is immersed in a 2T axial magnetic field and provides charged-particle tracking in the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip (SCT), and strawtube transition radiation tracking detectors. Since 2015 the pixel detector includes an additional layer at smaller radius, the \"insertable B-layer\" (IBL) [69,70]. The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2 to 6 T m across most of the detector. Measurements presented in this document use signals from the ID while other components are used for triggering. Events are selected with a trigger system [71]. The firstlevel (L1) trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. For this analysis the information from calorimeters, minimum bias trigger scintillator (MBTS) counters (covering the range 2.1 < |\u03b7| < 3.8) and zero degree calorimeters (ZDCs) with the range |\u03b7| > 8.3 is used at L1. The L1 trigger is followed by two software-based trigger levels: level-2 (L2) and Event Filter (EF). In pp datataking in 2015, the L2 and EF trigger levels are combined in a common high-level trigger (HLT) framework.",

The \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV Pb + Pb data set used in this analysis consists of the data collected in 2010 and then reprocessed in 2014 with the same reconstruction software as used for p + Pb data. The number of additional interactions per bunch crossing is negligibly small, of the order of 10 \u22124 . Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to determine the track reconstruction efficiency (Sect. 5) and to perform closure tests, as described in Sect. 7. For the 13 and 5.02 TeV pp data the baseline MC event generator used is Pythia 8 [73] with parameter values set according to the ATLAS A2 tune [74] and with MSTW2008LO parton distribution functions [75]. The Hijing event generator [76] is used to produce p + Pb and Pb + Pb collisions with the same energy as in the data. The detector response is simulated [77] with Geant 4 [78] and with detector conditions matching those during the data-taking. The simulated events are reconstructed with the same algorithms as data events, including track reconstruction.",

            "text": "For two-particle cumulants, c n {2}, the non-flow correlations can be reduced by requiring a large separation in pseudorapidity between particles forming a pair. As in the analysis of two-particle correlations [31,35,43,46], the requirement of | \u03b7| > 2 is implemented in calculating the cumulants c n {2, | \u03b7| > 2}. A comparison of c 2 {2} calculated without the | \u03b7| > 2 requirement and c 2 {2, | \u03b7| > 2} is shown in Fig. 4 for all collision systems. A strong reduction of the cumulant values can be seen after requiring | \u03b7| > 2, which is the most significant at low multiplicities and for pp collisions, where the short-range two-particle non-flow correlations dominate. Unfortunately, such a requirement on | \u03b7| cannot be applied in the calculation of cumulants of more than two particles in the standard cumulant approach applied in this analysis. This has to be taken into account when interpreting the results obtained for c n {4}. It is known (from Pythia [80] and Hijing simulations) that jet and dijet production can generate correlations between four particles, especially in collision systems (e.g. pp) where collective flow effects are expected to be small. Measurements of multi-particle cumulants and the corresponding flow harmonics require very large event samples, especially when considering cumulants and correlations between more than two particles. This analysis uses the twoparticle cumulants with a rapidity gap of | \u03b7| > 2 to determine c n {2, | \u03b7| > 2} for n = 2, 3 and 4 for all collision systems. Four-particle cumulants can be reliably determined for all collision systems only for c 2 {4}. A statistically significant measurement of higher-order cumulants and harmonics, n = 3, 4, with more than two-particle correlations is not possible with the current data sets. Statistical limitations are particularly severe for six-and eight-particle cumulants measured in pp collisions. The statistical uncertainty of the pp data sets used in this analysis is significantly larger than the expected magnitude of the six-and eight-particle cumulants, preventing reliable measurements of these observables.",

However, compared to almost degenerate values of v 2 {2k}, k > 1, a larger v 2 derived from two-particle cumulants is also predicted by models assuming fluctuation-driven initial-state anisotropies in small collision systems, either in the context of hydrodynamics as in Ref. [59] or in the effective theory of quantum chromodynamics in the regime of weak coupling [82,83]. Figure 11 shows the ratio v 2 {2k}/v 2 {2k \u2212 2} for p + Pb and low-multiplicity Pb + Pb collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. Interestingly, for Pb + Pb collisions all three ratios are independent of N ch ( p T > 0.4 GeV) beyond 120, independent of the p T range of reference particles. ",

For the v 2 harmonic the two measurements give consistent results for p + Pb collisions. For pp collisions the cumulant method gives v 2 values larger than those obtained with the 2PC method, suggesting that the former are contaminated by the non-flow correlations not removed by the | \u03b7| > 2 requirement. The fact that in contrast to v 2 {2PC} the v 2 harmonic cannot be determined from the measurement of the c 2 {4} cumulant reported here for pp collisions clearly indicates that this cumulant is biased by non-flow correlations.

The derived magnitude of the v 2 {4} harmonic is larger in Pb + Pb collisions than in p + Pb collisions with the same multiplicity.

Therefore, these measurements of four-particle cumulants in pp collisions, based on a method that suppresses the nonflow correlations associated with event-by-event fluctuations in the number of reference particles, generally do not satisfy the requirement of being negative. This indicates that c 2 {4} cumulants obtained from the standard procedure used in this paper may still be biased by residual non-flow correlations. The c 2 {4} cumulant in 13 TeV pp collisions measured by CMS is smaller over the full range of collision multiplicities than the c 2 {4} cumulant obtained by ATLAS with the nominal event selection (EvSel_M ref ) while it is consistent with the ATLAS measurement obtained with the EvSel_N ch event selection.",
