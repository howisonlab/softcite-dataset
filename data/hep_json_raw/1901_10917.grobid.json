            "text": "Searches for dijet resonances with masses of several hundreds of GeV to just above 1 TeV have been carried out at lower-energy colliders [3][4][5][6][7] and at the LHC, which has also extended search sensitivities into the multi-TeV mass range [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Despite using higher integrated luminosities than earlier colliders, these LHC searches have been limited at lower masses by a large multi-jet background. Multi-jet events are produced at such high rates that fully recording every event would saturate the online data selection (called trigger) and data acquisition systems. To avoid this, minimum transverse momentum (p min T ) thresholds are imposed on triggers collecting events with at least one jet (called single-jet triggers). These thresholds create a lower bound on the sensitivity of searches at a mass of approximately m jj \u2248 2p min T , where p min T is typically several hundred GeV. Consequently, searches for dijet resonances at the LHC have poor sensitivity for masses below 1 TeV, and set limits on the couplings of the resonance to quarks in this light-resonance region which are weaker than limits in heavy-resonance regions [23]. Nevertheless, despite the difficulty E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch. of recording events containing light resonances, they remain a viable search target at the LHC, both from a model-agnostic point of view [24] and, for example, in models of spin-dependent interactions of quarks with dark matter [1,2].",

To account for mismodelling in simulated b-hadron decays, a comparison of the discrimination power of this network in data and Monte Carlo simulation is performed and correction factors are applied to simulation to reproduce the data [49]. Jets are considered b-tagged when the DL1 score exceeds a threshold consistent with a 77% b-hadron identification efficiency on a benchmark tt sample. At this threshold, only 0.7% light-flavour jets and 25% charm-jets are retained. Events which contain at least one photon candidate and two jets are selected using the above criteria and separated into four categories for further analysis. Two of the categories are constructed with flavour-inclusive criteria, for which b-tagging results are ignored. One of these two categories contains events recorded via the single-photon trigger, and the other category contains events recorded via the combined trigger. To ensure the trigger is fully efficient, events in the single-photon-trigger category are required to have a photon with E Dijet production at the LHC occurs largely via t-channel processes, leading to jet pairs with high absolute values of y * = (y 1 \u2212 y 2 )/2, where y 1 and y 2 are the rapidities of the highest-p T (leading) and second-highest-p T (subleading) jet, respectively. On the other hand, heavy particles tend to decay more isotropically, with the two jets having lower |y * | values. Therefore, |y * | < 0.75 is required for all four categories. This selection rejects up to 80% of the multi-jet background events while accepting up to 80% of the signal events discussed below. A further selection is applied to select events above a given invariant mass depending on the trigger, m jj > 169 GeV for the single-photon trigger and m jj > 335 GeV for the combined trigger. This is so that the background can be described by a smoothly falling analytic function satisfying the goodness-of-fit criteria described in 4. The above selections, summarised in Table 1,  At the largest dijet masses considered, the combined-trigger categories provide greater sensitivity to signals than the single-photon-trigger categories due to their greater signal acceptance. The sensitivity is defined as S/ \u221a B, where S and B are the number of signal and background events in the simulation samples described in Section 6. At the smallest dijet masses considered, the jet p T thresholds of the combined trigger cause those categories to lose efficiency for signals and bias the m jj distributions of the background processes. Therefore, to optimise the search across a wide range of signal masses, the invariant mass spectra selected using the combined-trigger categories are used in the search for signal masses above 450 GeV, while the spectra obtained with the single-photon trigger are used for lower masses.",

The dijet searches of the CDF, CMS, and ATLAS experiments [6,8,11,15,17,17,15,7,20] have successfully modelled dijet mass distributions in hadron colliders using a single function over the entire mass range considered in those searches. This approach is not suitable when data constrain the fit too tightly for a single function to reliably model both ends of the distribution simultaneously. Here, a more flexible technique is adopted, similar to that used in recent ATLAS dijet resonance searches [22,21]. In this technique, a single fit using a given function over the entire mass distribution is replaced by many successive fits. For each bin of the mass distribution, the same function is used to fit a broad mass range centred on the bin, and the background prediction for that bin is taken to be the value of the fitted function in the centre of the range. The process is repeated for each bin of the mass distribution and the results are combined to form a background prediction covering the entire distribution. For invariant masses higher than the m jj range used for the search (above 1.1 TeV), the window is allowed to extend beyond the range as long as data is available.",

(2), a four-parameter variant with p 5 = 0 and a threeparameter variant with p 5 = p 4 = 0 are also considered. The width of the mass range used for the individual fits was optimised to retain the broadest possible range while maintaining a \u03c7 2 p-value above 0.05 in regions of the distribution that do not contain narrow excesses, where excesses are identified using the BumpHunter algorithm described in the next section. The sliding window procedure cannot be extended beyond the lower edge of the m jj range used in each signal selection. Therefore, until the optimal number of bins is reached on each side of a given bin centre, the start of the window is fixed to the lower edge of the spectrum and the fitted functional form is evaluated for each bin in turn. This procedure allows for a stable background estimate while maintaining sensitivity to signals localised in the m jj distribution. Tests performed by adding sample signals to smooth pseudo-data distributions confirmed that this approach can find signals of widthto-mass ratios up to 15%, with sensitivity increasing for narrower signals. The ranges of the individual fits vary from 750 GeV in the narrowest case to 1600 GeV in the widest case.
