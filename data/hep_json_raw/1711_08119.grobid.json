Experimentally, the cross section has been measured only at the relatively low energies (below 400 GeV) available at neutrino beams from accelerators [1,2]. Here we report the first measurement of neutrino absorption in the Earth, using a sample of 10,784 energetic upward-going neutrino-induced muons ob-served with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The flux of high-energy neutrinos transiting long paths through the Earth is attenuated compared to a reference sample that follows shorter trajectories through the Earth. Using a fit to the two-dimensional distribution of muon energy and zenith angle, we determine the cross section for neutrino energies between 6.3 TeV and 980 TeV, more than an order of magnitude higher in energy than previous measurements. The measured cross section is 1.30 +0.21 \u22120.19 (stat.) +0.39 \u22120.43 (syst.) times the prediction of the Standard Model [3], consistent with the expectation for charged and neutral current interactions. We do not observe a dramatic increase in the cross section, expected in some speculative models, including those invoking new compact dimensions [4] or the production of leptoquarks [5].",

Neutrino cross section measurements.Compilation of neutrino charged current cross section measurements, divided by neutrino energy, from accelerator experiments, from[1] and the current result. The blue and green lines are the Standard Model predictions for \u03bd\u00b5 and \u03bd\u00b5 respectively, with the uncertainties on the deep inelastic cross sections shown by the shaded bands[3]. The red line is for the expected mixture of \u03bd\u00b5 and \u03bd\u00b5 in the IceCube sample. The black line shows the current result, assuming that the charged and neutral current cross sections vary in proportion, and that the ratio between the actual cross section and the Standard Model prediction does not depend on energy. The pink band shows the total 1\u03c3 (statistical plus systematic) uncertainty. The cross section rises linearly with energy up to about 3 TeV, but then the increase moderates, to roughly as E 0.3 \u03bd , due to the finite W \u00b1 and Z 0 masses.",
