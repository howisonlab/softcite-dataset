Furthermore, massive boosted jets constitute an important background in searches for various new physics models [3][4][5][6], the Higgs boson [7], and highly boosted top quark production. Particularly relevant is the case where the decay of a heavy resonance produces high-p T top quarks that decay hadronically. In all these cases, the hadronic decay products can be detected as a single jet with a large mass and internal substructure that differs on average from pQCD jets once the jet p T is greater than 400-500 GeV/c. However, experimental studies of the substructure of high p T jets at the Tevatron have been limited to jets with p T < 400 GeV/c [8,9]; recently results with higher p T jets produced at the Large Hadron Collider have been published [10].",

The resulting average mass shift upward as a function of m jet is taken as the correction downward due to MI and the energy flow from the underlying event (UE) of the hard collision. We separately measure the UE correction by using only events with N vtx = 1. We correct the leading jet mass, m jet1 , for events with N vtx > 1 by the difference between the mass shift in multi-vertex events and the mass shift in single vertex events. The correction has an approximate 1/m jet1 behaviour and averages \u223c 4 GeV/c 2 for a jet cone size of R = 0.7. The jet mass correction for a cone size of R = 0.4 is \u223c 0.5 GeV/c 2 , consistent with the expected R 4 scaling [2]. In the following, we focus on results for R = 0.7",

Based on a pythia calculation, we estimate W and Z boson production to contribute \u223c 25 jets with masses between 60 and 100 GeV/c 2 , which is less than 5% of the number observed. However, top quark pair production can contribute to the jet mass region m jet1 > 100 GeV/c 2 where the expected QCD jet rate is much lower. We employ an approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation of the t t differential cross section [25] updated with the MSTW 2008 PDFs [26] and a top quark mass of m top = 173 GeV/c 2 [27]. This yields a cross section for top quark jets with p T > 400 GeV/c of 4.6 fb. We used the pythia 6.216 generator to create a t t MC sample and applied the same selection requirements used to define the event sample. The estimated t t contribution to the data sample, normalized to the NNLO cross section, is 13 \u00b1 4 events.",
