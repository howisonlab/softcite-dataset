The first two-thirds gives a Summary and Highlights, or snapshot, of High Energy Physics at the end of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 2. It can be view as the combined effort of the program organizers, the invited plenary speakers, and finally filtered into the present mosaic. It certainly should not be viewed as comprehensive. In the second one-third, a more personal Perspective and Outlook is given, including my take on the flavor anomalies, and why the next 3 years, the period of Long Shutdown 2 plus first year (or more) of LHC Run 3, would be Bright and Flavorful, with much hope for uncovering New Physics. We advocate extra Yukawa couplings as the most likely, next, New Physics to be tested, the effect of which is already written in our Matter Universe.",

But, lured by the 1995 total solar eclipse, I did join the second one held in Ho Chi Minh City. I still have the conference T-shirt, which I wore as a personal tribute when giving the \"HEP Summary and Outlook\" at the 25th Anniversary. 1 In the first part of this brief review, which is adapted from the talk, I will cover the Highlights at the LHC and the corresponding experimental subjects, then flavor physics, a neutrinos and Dark Matter (DM), then theory, and finally on Asia in the World. As there were only 7 theory talks out of a total of 37 plenary talks (I apologize for not covering parallel talks, as well as any other negligence), our emphasis would be on experiment. In the second part, I will offer a Perspective and Outlook on the HEP Window on the Universe.",

One major highlight of 2018 is the completion of direct measurements, by both ATLAS and CMS, of third generation Yukawa couplings: all were found to be consistent with SM expectations. This started with the jet-assisted observation (when combined with Run 1) of H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in 2017 by CMS, 8 and the subsequent observation 9 using Run 2 data alone. Then there was the observation 10,11 of ttH production before summer 2018 (more on this later in the Outlook part). And finally, the observation of H \u2192 bb in V H production, which was officially announced in a joint seminar at CERN in late August 2018, shortly after the Rencontres du Vietnam. ATLAS had already announced it at ICHEP2018 in Seoul, 12 but the CMS Spokesperson traveled to Quy Nhon for the make-up first announcement, 13 culminating in the two subsequently submitted, and readily accepted, papers. 14,15 What is remarkable is that Z \u2192 bb provides \"in situ\" validation of the method, where excess above the Z can be clearly seen, and found consistent with H \u2192 bb in mass and cross section. Combining all available data, ATLAS 14 and CMS 15 give the H \u2192 bb signal strength \u00b5 = 1.01 \u00b1 0.20 and 1.04 \u00b1 0.20, respectively, for the ratio compared with SM expectation. Note that both central values are remarkably close to 1, although each were a combination of several different processes.",

Having an extra triplet offers a doubly-charged H \u00b1\u00b1 boson, but otherwise it is not so easy to distinguish from a 2HDM. The most popular model is 2HDM II that is automatic in minimal SUSY (MSSM): up-type quarks couple to one doublet, down-type quarks (and charged leptons) to the other doublet. As alluded to already, a special phenomenon that emerged from LHC Run 1 is that cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), the h 0 -H 0 mixing angle between CP -even Higgs bosons in 2HDM II, appears to be small, i.e. h 0 is rather close to the SM Higgs boson. 7 This alignment phenomena, that Run 1 data prefers the cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2192 0 limit, should be pursued with vigor using full Run 2 data.",

At the Rencontres du Vietnam, BESIII also reported for the first time 86 strong evidence, at 4.3\u03c3 statistical significance, the Z c \u2192 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b7 c decay mode in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 c production.

Neutrinoless double beta decay can occur if the neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. their own antiparticles.

The most important thing, 172 at time of Rencontres du Vietnam, is to hear the positive decision by end of 2018 from the Japanese government on whether, or not, to host ILC250 in Japan, o and start the international negotiations. Signs at the dedicated LCWS2018 conference held October in Arlington, Texas, looked promising. The ideal timeline would be construction start in \u223c 5 years, and completion by another 9 years. Unfortunately, the Science Council of Japan issued a negative report in Decemeber 2018. But all is not lost, as the final decision is with the Japanese government, and things in Japan are \"subtle\", i.e. often not as it seems on the surface. MEXT of Japan has announced that the decision would be deferred until before the joint meeting of LCB (Linear Collider Board) and ICFA (International Committee for Future Accelerators), to be held early March 2019 in Tokyo.",

But, after the original R K result 194 of 2014 that showed \u22122.6\u03c3 discrepancy with SM for q 2 in 1.0 \u2212 6.0 GeV 2 , it took 3 years for LHCb to put forth 195 the R K * measurement (see Fig. 15). The two R K * bins are for q 2 in 0.045\u22121.1 GeV 2 and 1.1\u22126.0 GeV 2 , showing \u22122.2\u03c3 and \u22122.4\u03c3 downward shifts, respectively. s Looks brilliant. However, why change from 1.0 to 1.1 GeV 2 ? It is to cover the \u03c6 meson: the lower R K * bin is dominated by the photon. But the photon coupling to e and \u00b5 is certainly Universal. So, at EPSHEP2017 summer conference held in Venice, I had cautioned relatively loudly with something like, \"I will bet that LHCb measured the lower R K * bin as a sanity check, since it is expected to be consistent with SM.\" If SM was confirmed in the lower bin, LHCb would have proclaimed victory, and then combine the two corresponding (in q 2 ) R K and R K * bins. Given the common drop for all three measurements, I stress that one ought to follow Occam's advice and keep in mind the \"simpler\" explanation: rather than NP, could it be some common systematics, perhaps traced to normalizing 195 on B \u2192 K ( * ) J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , e + e \u2212 )?",

This already lead to many theory papers toting \u2206C 9 \u223c \u22121 in 2013, but questions also arose whether this was a fluctuation among many measurables, or possibly due to r Well, call it the advice from an \"Experimentheorist\". s In fact, the downward shift from 1.0 is the largest for the lower q 2 bin, but its SM expectation is lower because of dimuon threshold effect. the cc threshold, i.e. hadronic, effects. But perhaps more symptomatic was when LHCb announced the 3 fb \u22121 result at Moriond 2015, significance of the discrepancy dropped slightly 197 to 3.4\u03c3, despite the increase in statistics allowed splitting the bin into two. That is, while errors improved, the central values of both bins moved closer to SM. Statistically speaking, there is nothing \"wrong\" with this, but when I first learned about it, I quipped that this is \"Not Good, Not Bad . . . Not Too Good\". If the original measurement was close to \"Truth\", one would expect the significance to improve somewhat when data tripled. It also makes the cc threshold issue more troubling. 198 Adding on top of this was the CMS announcement in 2017, based on 8 TeV data, where the values in the two bins are consistent with SM. 199 Note that Belle has one broad bin that is consistent with LHCb but with less resolution, while ATLAS lacks a second bin, even though the first bin shows wide deviation.",

The \u03c1 ct coupling is actually constrained by B physics to be rather small, 207 and I now think \u03c1 ii should be O(\u03bb i ), i.e. \u03c1 cc should be suppressed by m c /v 0.005, but \u03c1 tc , \u03c1 tt ought to be O(\u03bb t ) \u223c 1. Eq. (1) improves on the Cheng-Sher trickle-down argument 208 (which I coined the \"type III 2HDM\" name) when I first advocated t \u2192 ch decay a long time ago: 209 the tch coupling is modulated by cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), the h-H mixing angle, where H is the exotic CP -even neutral Higgs of the extra Higgs doublet. In this sense, if cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) is small, which is reflected in the apparent alignment phenomenon that h appears rather close to SM Higgs, 7 the non-observation of t \u2192 ch so far (see Sec. 1.6 and Note that, without a Z 2 symmetry, one cannot actually distinguish the \u03a6 1 and \u03a6 2 doublets, hence v 1 and v 2 , and thus tan \u03b2 = v 1 /v 2 is ill-defined. We therefore replace cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) in Eq. (1) by cos \u03b3, the notation which was first used in Ref. 210. We note that this reference provides a one-loop protection mechanism for alignment: with the right sign, \u03c1 tt \u223c O(\u03bb t ) \u223c 1 can restore | sin \u03b3| \u2192 1 from sizable bosonic loop corrections arising from O(1) Higgs quartic couplings.",
