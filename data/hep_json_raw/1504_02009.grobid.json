Several models of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) describe the data well at most of our kinematics. This increases our confidence that we understand the GPD H, expected to be the dominant contributor to these observables. Through a leading-twist extraction of Compton Form Factors, these results support the model predictions of a larger nucleon size at lower quarkmomentum fraction xB.",

How are the spatial and momentum distributions of the quarks and gluons (i.e., the partons) correlated inside the nucleon? How do the partons contribute to the bulk properties of the proton (mass, spin, charge,...)? These are some fundamental questions at the intersection of nuclear and particle physics which are still to be resolved.",

In the valence-quark region, this corresponds to Compton scattering at the quark level, with the incoming photon radiated from the lepton beam. As in the study of atomic or nuclear structure, the energy and angular distributions of the scattered photon reflect the distribution in momentum and/or space of the targets, which in our case are the quarks inside the proton. At JLab, electron beams are used and the reaction to study proton structure is ep \u2192 e p \u03b3.

At leading-order QCD, GPDs do not depend on Q 2 . At leading-twist QCD (i.e., when quark-gluon interactions and higher-order quark loops are neglected), four GPDs enter the description of the DVCS process: H,H, E and E, representing the four independent helicity-spin tran-sitions of the quark-nucleon system between the initial and final states. The GPDs are QCD matrix elements that project on a few variables the full complexity of the quarks' and gluons' dynamics within the nucleon. The GPDs embody the longitudinal momentum distribution of the quarks in the nucleon, their transverse spatial distribution, and the correlation between these two distributions. One uses the term nucleon tomography as one can probe the transverse size of the nucleon for different quark longitudinal-momentum slices.

Electrons were identified by signals in the CLAS drift chambers, scintillators, Cherenkov counters, and electromagnetic calorimeters. Protons were identified by the correlation between their measured momentum and velocity. The highest-energy particle detected in the IC was considered as a photon candidate. Once these three final-state particles were selected and their 3-momenta determined, the exclusivity of the ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 reaction was ensured by applying 3\u03c3 cuts on the following four variables: the squared missing mass M M 2 e p of the (e p X) system, the coplanarity angle \u2206\u03c6, i.e., the angle between the (\u03b3 * , p ) and (\u03b3 * , \u03b3) planes, the missing transverse momentum of the (e p \u03b3) system, and the angle \u03b8 \u03b3X between the measured photon and that predicted by the kinematics of the (e p X) system. We also selected the particular kinematics: W > 2 GeV, where W 2 = s = (\u03b3 * + p) 2 , to minimize contributions from radiative decay of baryonic resonances, and Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 to be in the deep virtual regime. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the effect of two of the four exclusivity cuts. Under these conditions, we ended up with about 300,000 events. Figure 3 shows the resulting (Q 2 , x B ) and (\u2212t, x B ) kinematic coverages of the data and the adopted binning [21 (Q 2 , x B ) bins and 6 t bins], which is finer than the one used in [13]. Note that the bins and results presented here are limited to the |t| region below 0.52 GeV 2 while the actual coverage of the data goes beyond 1 GeV 2 . The ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 cross sections vary very rapidly with kinematics, primarily due to the BH process. In order to minimize the uncertainties related to the knowledge of the kinematics, we minimized the size of our bins, while keeping comparable statistics in each bin.",

We evaluated the contamination from the ep \u2192 e p \u03c0 0 channel where one photon of the \u03c0 0 decay can escape detection, using a combination of ep \u2192 e p \u03c0 0 measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations. On average, this contamination is less than 9% and was subtracted on a bin-by-bin basis. The fourdimensional acceptance/efficiency of the CLAS detector, Acc, for the ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 reaction was determined for each (Q 2 , x B , t, \u03c6) bin by generating more than 200 million DVCS+BH events, using a realistic Monte-Carlo generator adapted from [20]. The events were processed through the GEANT simulation of the CLAS detector, and the same reconstruction and analysis codes that were used for the data. The event generator includes radiative effects so that Acc also corrects for a part of the real internal radiative effects. F rad corrects, for each (Q 2 , x B , t, \u03c6) bin, for the virtual and the remainder of the real internal radiative effects, which can be both calculated theoretically [21]. The product (\u2206Q 2 \u2206x B \u2206t\u2206\u03c6) is the effective hypervolume of each bin. Finally, L int is the integrated luminosity, corrected for the data acquisition dead time, which was deduced from the integrated charge of the beam measured by a Faraday cup. In addition, we applied a global renormalization factor of 12.3%, determined from the analysis of the elastic scattering ep \u2192 e p , by comparing the experimental cross section to the well-known theoretical one. This factor compensates for various kinematic-independent inefficiencies, such as those from the CLAS time-of-flight scintillators and trigger, not well reproduced by the simulations. Figure 4 shows, for two selected (Q 2 , x B ) bins in different parts of the phase space, the \u03c6-dependence of the ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 unpolarized cross section and beam-polarized cross-section difference. The latter of these two observables is defined as follows:",

            "text": "The unpolarized cross sections peak towards \u03c6=0 \u2022 due to the BH process (green long-dashed curves in Fig. 4) for which the final-state photon is predominantly emitted in the direction of the initial or scattered electron. The difference between the BH curves and the data can thus be attributed to the DVCS process. We display in Fig. 4 calculations of four GPD models. The modeling of the GPDs in the VGG and KMS models is based on the Double-Distribution representation [1,27,28]. The VGG calculations in Fig. 4 only include the contribution of the GPD H as the inclusion of the other GPDs barely changes the results. The KM model is based on the Mellin-Barnes representation [25,29]. The KM10 version of the model includes contributions from all four GPDs for which the free parameters were fitted to the JLab [12,13], HERMES [30] and ZEUS/H1 [31,32] data. In that work, it was found that it is possible to fit the JLab Hall A unpolarized cross sections only at the price of introducing a very strongH contribution [33]. The KM10a version is based on a fit which excludes the JLab Hall A unpolarized cross sections [12] and setsH to zero. Note that none of these four models has been tuned to our data. Figure 4 shows that the predictions of standard GPD models like VGG, KMS, and KM10a, whose compatibility is remarkable despite their different approaches, are in good agreement with our unpolarized cross-section data. In contrast, the KM10 version, which includes the strong H contribution, tends to overestimate our data. Over our 110 (Q 2 , x B , t) bins, the average \u03c7 2 value per degree of freedom [34] is the smallest for KM10a (1.46), followed by KMS (1.85), VGG (1.91), and KM10 (3.94). We can therefore conclude that standard GPD models with a dominant contribution of the GPD H to the unpolarized cross section, i.e., without the introduction of a strongH contribution, describe the data well. Moreover, the disagreement between our data and the KM10 model, which instead matches the Hall A results, might reveal an inconsistency between the two sets of data. As a check, we performed a dedicated data analysis using the exact same (Q 2 , x B , t) bin limits as those used for the Hall A analysis (Q 2 =2.3 GeV 2 , x B =0.36, and \u2212t =0.17, 0.23, 0.28 and 0.33 GeV 2 ). However, in this limited and particular (Q 2 , x B , t) region, the comparison is hampered by our large statistical uncertainties and lack of \u03c6-coverage around \u03c6 = 180 \u2022 . Thus no conclusion can be drawn from this comparison. The Hall A experiment was run at a luminosity almost three orders of magnitude larger than ours, but in a much more limited phase space.",

Despite the underconstrained nature of the problem, i.e., fitting two observables with four free parameters, the algorithm generally manages to find, when the range of variation of the CFFs is limited, minimum \u03c7 2 values for H Im and H Re as the two fitted observables are dominated by the contribution of the GPD H. Figure 5 shows, for a selection of three of our 21 (Q 2 , x B ) bins, the t-distribution of the fitted H Im and H Re . Contrary to these two,H Im andH Re do not come out of the fit with finite error bars within the allowed range of variation, for most kinematics. Nonetheless, they must be included in the fit because of their impact on the errors of H Im and H Re . Figure 5 also shows the VGG predictions, which overestimates the fitted H Im at the smallest values of x B .",

Keeping in mind that the Q 2 values are different for the three x B bins, the results of these fits show that A and b increase, in a systematic way, with decreasing x B . Under the hypothesis of neglecting Q 2 higher-twist and evolution effects as well as deskewing effects [41], these behaviors might reveal tomographic features of the quark content of the nucleon. Under the mentioned conditions, b is related to the transverse size of the nucleon. Our data therefore suggest that the size of the nucleon increases as lower momentum fractions (proportional to x B ) are probed. The rising of A reflects the increase of the partonic content of the nucleon as lower x B values are probed. H Re does not lend itself easily to a simple interpretation as it involves a weighted integration of the GPD H over x. Nevertheless, its extraction is of great use to constrain models.",

The full data set, available at [42], will provide stringent constraints on GPD models. We have shown that three well-known GPD models describe the data well without additional inputs. The model interpretation of the present results favors a smaller deviation from the pure BH process around \u03c6 = 180 \u2022 than suggested by the Hall A data. Within such models, this reinforces the expectation of the Hdominance in the unpolarized cross section. We have also extracted the H Im and H Re CFFs from our data. Under some assumptions, our results suggest that the nucleon size increases at lower parton-momentum values, thus revealing from experiment a first tomographic image of the nucleon.",
