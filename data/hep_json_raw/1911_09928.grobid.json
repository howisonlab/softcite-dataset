            "text": "An extensive knowledge of the dynamics of the process of pp collision serves as input to exhaustive theoretical models of strong interaction. This knowledge is also a baseline for a system to decipher the dynamics of AA collisions at relativistic and ultrarelativistic energies. Recent availability of di-muon data has triggered a spate of interests in revisiting strong interaction process, the study of which in detail is extremely important for enhancement of our understanding of not only the theory of strong interaction but also possible physics scenarios beyond the standard model. Apart from conventional approaches to the study of the dynamics of particle production in high-energy collision the present authors proposed a new approach with successful application in context of symmetry scaling in AA collision data from (ALICE-Collaboration, 2014) in the work  and pp collision data at 8TeV from (CMS-collaboration, 2017) in the work  and also in other numerous works with different collision data. This different approach essentially analyses fluctuation pattern from the perspective of symmetry scaling or degree of self-similarity involved in the process. This was done with the help of multifractal scaling analysis and also multifractal cross-correlation analysis using the single variable of pseudorapidity values of di-muon data taken out from the primary dataset of RunA(2011) and RunB(2012) of the pp collision at 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively, from (CMS-collaboration, 2016(CMS-collaboration,  , 2017. High degree of persistent long-range cross-correlations (MF-DXA) exist between pseudorapidity-value and its corresponding azimuthal-value for different rapidity ranges. The different values of scaling exponents (across rapidity ranges and energies) signify that there may be multiple processes other than those conjectured, involved in the underlying dynamics of the production process of oppositely charged di-muons resulting in different kinds of scaling. Otherwise, the scaling exponents at different degrees would have remained the same across the rapidity ranges and also for different energies.",

            "text": "In the recent past, fluctuation and correlation have been analyzed widely using novel methods of studying nonstatistical fluctuation which resulted in the better understanding of the dynamics of the pionisation process. The methods including the process of intermittency were introduced by Bialas and Peschanski [1] who have observed association between intermittency indices and anomalous fractal dimension [2,3]. After that, the parameters of Gq moment and Tq moment [4][5][6][7][8] were introduced which were deduced from various methods based on fractal concepts. Then distinctive approaches of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multifractal-DFA (MF-DFA) [9,10] were applied extensively for analyzing nonstationary, nonlinear properties of data series to investigate the long-range correlations inherent in the process of particle production [11][12][13][14]. Among various other contemporary works, self-similarity has been analyzed in the areas of particle physics which includes the production process of Jet and Top-quark in the experiments of Tevatron and LHC [15], the procedure of strangeness production in pp collisions at the RHIC [16] experiments, the phenomenon of proton spin and asymmetry inherent in jet production process [17] and the deciphering of the collective phenomena [18], and the process of establishment of the notion of self-similar symmetry of dark energy [19]. The study of long-range cross-correlation between two nonstationary signals detrended cross-correlation analysis (DXA) had been presented by Podobnik and Stanley [20]. Wang et al. [21] introduced multifractal-detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DXA) by combining MF-DFA and DXA methods to examine higher degree of multifractal parameters of two cross-correlated series. MF-DXA method has been applied with substantially higher degree of accuracy in the analysis of the unrevealed cross-correlation in the various fields of physics, physiology finance, and power markets [20,21] and also in the fields of particle physics [22].",

            "text": "The main aim of high-energy physics is to prove the existence of the creation of the QGP state, and also the study of the properties of this exotic state, by examining the final state of produced-hadrons, produced in huge numbers. Most of these final state particles may not be produced from the decay of the plasma directly, but rather they are produced or influenced by the hadronic cascade. Hence, studies of resonance states are of great importance because there is a variety of resonances, having very different lifespans, which signifies that these particles decay with differing probabilities in the hadronic stage, and therefore provide valuable information about that stage. We have performed the scaling analysis of the pseudorapidity space taken out from Pb-Pb VSD masterclass data at 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair from ALICE Collaboration [23] using both the method of complex network-based visibility graph and multifractal-DFA (MF-DFA) [9,10], to study the prospective phase transition and the signature of QGP [24,25]. We also studied multiplicity fluctuation process in nucleus-nucleus and hadron-nucleus interactions by applying complex network and chaos-based visibility graph methodology in quite a few recent works [22,[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. These techniques have also been successfully applied to identify phase transitions in temperature-driven magnetization properties [34] and also in temperature-driven phase transition from liquid to vapour state [35]. In a recent study [36], different combinations of topological and kinematic input variables from the data of RunA(2011) of the pp collision at 7 TeV at CMS detector have been used, from which several ANNs (artificial neural networks) have been constructed, and then through comparison, the optimally configured ANN is selected .",

Moreover, apart from the analysis of AA collisions, an extensive knowledge of pp collisions is required both as an input to comprehensive theoretical models of strong interactions and also as a baseline to decipher the AA collisions at relativistic and ultrarelativistic energy levels. This has been of great interest in the area of theoretical and experimental physics. The process of soft particle generation from ultrarelativistic pp collisions is affected by the flavor distribution among the proton, quark hadronization, and baryon number transport. In the process of AA collisions, the magnitude of the spectrum of transverse momentum of charged particles in pp collisions serves as an important reference. A pp reference spectrum is required for AA collisions to probe for the effects of probable initial states of the collision. The multiplicity distribution of particles generated in pp collisions and the multiplicity dependence of various global event features serve as rudimentary observables which reflect the features of the underlying dynamics of the process of particle production. Therein lies the importance of analyzing the dynamics of di-muon production process in pp collisions. In this work, we have attempted DFA, MF-DFA, and MF-DXA for the scaling analysis of the rapidity and energy dependence of the di-muon production process.",

A latest review work has been reported about the complexities involved in resonance production process for different high-energy collisions like pp, pA, and AA collisions at LHC(using data from ALICE collaboration), to analyze the complexity and eventually explain the inherent dynamics of the particle production process and the properties of the generated particles for the different collision system [39]. We have elaborated in Section 1 how after few successful ventures by the present authors in the field of analyzing the pionisation process in high-energy interaction using chaos-based procedures and being motivated by the different attempts reported to investigate the dynamics of the generation process of di-muon pairs in [39], we have attempted to revisit the di-muon production process in hadron-hadron interactions. We have proposed to implement the chaosbased methods of DFA, MF-DFA, and MF-DXA to analyze the energy and rapidity dependence of di-muon production process by utilizing a single variable of pseudorapidity values of di-muon data taken out of the primary dataset of RunA(2011) and RunB(2012) of the pp collision at 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively, from CMS collaboration [40,41]. The rapidity and energy dependence of the process are examined by means of fundamental scaling parameter signifying the degree of symmetry scaling or scale-freeness in the dimuon production process, extracted by the proposed method.",

Apart from the J/\u03a8 peak observed in their invariant-mass spectrum, there can be existence of other upsilon states and other processes in principle contributing to the di-muon continuum due to open charm and open beauty decays. One may select different ranges of invariant mass by examining the pattern of invariant-mass spectrum of the events producing di-muons. For each such range, the pseudorapidity spaces corresponding to the produced di-muons would be extracted, and then for each of the spaces, the proposed scaling analysis may be done for different ranges of rapidity and energy. Any substantial change in scaling behavior indicated by the width of MF-DFA spectrum and the degree of multifractal cross-correlation may be attributed to the occurrence of different kinds of resonance states from which di-muons are produced in pp collisions. This may act as basic input for studying similar resonance production in pp collisions at higher energy and also for pA and AA collisions.",

This makes the multifractal spectrum or the scaling pattern of randomized series insensitive to the local fluctuations with large or small magnitudes, which is not the case with the actual experimental data. Hence, it results in the different widths of multifractal spectrum calculated the randomized version from those for the original version. Moreover, for two completely different experimental datasets the randomized data may be different with regards to peak, shape, and trend. The width of the multifractal spectrum has normally been less for the randomized data than the one for the experimental data (v) The main conclusion comes from the fact that the values of the width of the multifractal spectrum calculated experimental data being significantly different from shuffled ensembles  The comparison of the widths of the multifractal spectrum generated for the \u03b7 spaces for all the 5 ranges of \u03b7 values for 7 and 8 TeV datasets with respect to their rapidity and energy dependence is shown in Figure 3.

The values of the width of MF-DFA spectrum, essentially is an indicator of inherent symmetry and scalefreeness (different at different energy and rapidity ranges) with which the produced di-muons create the signatures in terms of \u03b7 values. The values of these parameters in experimental data being significantly different from shuffled ensembles confirm that this inherent symmetry and degree of scalefreeness is never the outcome of randomization process but is indicative of the dynamics involved in the di-muon production process.  Step 1, the corresponding azimuthal-\u03d5 space is also extracted. The 10 corresponding \u03d5 space is sorted in the ascending order and then mapped into data series. They in turn are mapped into a two-dimensional space with their sequence along the X-axis and the corresponding values of \u03d5 along the Y-axis It is to be noted that the linear trend confirms the power-law behavior of F q \u00f0s\u00de versus s for all the values of q for the \u03d5 spaces. The same analysis is done for all the \u03d5 spaces corresponding to the \u03b7 ranges for both 8 and 7 TeV datasets, and a similar trend is observed. However, for the \u03d5 data series corresponding to the particular range of \u03b7 at 8 TeV, h\u00f0q\u00de decreases at a higher rate for positive values of q than the corresponding ones calculated for the same range of \u03b7 at 7 TeV. This means, in this case, h\u00f0q\u00de is a bit more affected by the local fluctuations with large magnitudes, resulting in higher rate of decrease for h\u00f0q\u00de with increasing order of positive q for the \u03d5 data series of 8 TeV than the corresponding one for 7 TeV data. This has happened because there may exist fluctuations with comparatively large magnitude for the \u03c6 data series for higher energy-8 TeV than the one for 7 TeV. 2) for multifractal crosscorrelation changes almost at the same rate for both 8 and 7 TeV energies. It should be noted that the maximum and minimum values of h x,y \u00f0q\u00de for 8 and 7 TeV are different; however, the change of h x,y \u00f0q\u00de with the increasing values of q is almost the same. Although for 8 TeV, there is higher rate of decrease for h\u00f0q\u00de with increasing order of positive qs for the \u03d5 data series than the corresponding one for 7 TeV data, resulting from possible higher magnitude of fluctuation for \u03d5 data series, that decreasing trend gets nullified while calculating the covariance of \u03d5 data series and corresponding \u03b7 data series at 8 TeV energy. Hence, the trend of h x,y \u00f0q\u00de with the increasing values of q is almost the same for both energies. However, this has resulted in the lower ranges of the values of degree of cross-correlation h x,y \u00f0q\u00de for 8 TeV, making them less cross-correlated (ii) For q = 2, both h\u00f0q\u00de and h x,y \u00f0q\u00de are >0.5 and for \u03d5 space h\u00f0q\u00de is much higher than that for the corresponding \u03b7 space (iii) Also, h x,y \u00f0q\u00de is much higher than 0.5 for the pair of datasets for q = 2. This suggests the presence of long-range correlation and persistence in both spaces (iv) Moreover, there is a drop in the value of h x,y \u00f0q\u00de around q = \u22121. In most of the previous works, it has been shown that there exists similar trend of h x,y \u00f0q\u00de or the degree of cross-correlation with increasing values of order or q, as seen in the present analysis (v) Similar analysis has been done for all the 10 pairs of datasets, and similar trend is observed for all of them (7) Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the comparison of the trend of different values of f \u00f0\u03b1\u00de versus \u03b1 for the same \u03b7, \u03d5 spaces and the same trend calculated for their cross-correlation, for 8 and 7 TeV datasets, respectively (i) For both energy ranges, width of the crosscorrelation curve is the maximum, followed by the width of the multifractal spectrum of the \u03d5 space and then that of the \u03b7 space (ii) Again, similar trend is observed for all the pairs of datasets in this experiment. The more wide the spectrum is, the more degree of multifractality is inherent in the data series  Figure 8 shows the comparison of multifractal cross-correlation coefficients (\u03b3 i ) between \u03d5 and \u03b7 spaces for all the 5 ranges of \u03b7 values for 7 and 8 TeV datasets with respect to their rapidity as well as energy dependence.

However, the present investigation, as we have pointed out earlier, is based on a deep-rooted dynamics of di-lepton production process in hadron-hadron interaction from the basic perspective of symmetry-based scaling in different pseudorapidity ranges in two different energies. We have used two rigorous and robust methodologies, namely, MF-DFA and MF-DXA, for the scaling analysis of the dynamics of the di-muon production process using di-muon data taken from the primary dataset of RunA(2011) and RunB(2012) of the pp collision at 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively, from CMS collaboration. We have analyzed how this scaling pattern has evolved from one rapidity range to the next one and how this change evolved from lower energy range of 7 TeV to the higher one 8 TeV, and the findings are listed below.",

Similar trend is observed for the rest of the \u03b7 ranges (4) Table 2 and the Figure 8 show that for both 7 and 8 TeV data, all the 5 \u03b7 spaces are highly cross-correlated with their corresponding \u03d5 spaces and how the degree of cross-correlation changes from one \u03b7 space to the other and from one energy range to another. It should be noted that the degree of multifractal cross-correlation, \u03b3 i , is maximum for the first \u03b7 range for 8 TeV data, and the same is maximum for the third range of 7 TeV data. \u03b3 i is minimum for the fifth \u03b7 range for 8 TeV data and for the first range of 7 TeV data This analysis manifests different degree of symmetry scaling or scale-freeness in different pseudorapidity domains and at the same time different degree of cross-correlation between pseudorapidity and azimuthal space at both energy. The differences in the values of scaling and cross-correlation exponents representing the degree of symmetry scaling and degree of cross-correlation, respectively, calculated for different ranges of rapidity and at two different energy values, indicate the existence of several processes involved in the production process of oppositely charged di-muons giving rise to varying degree of scaling. The observed difference of degree of symmetry scaling in different rapidity domains at two different energy values may provide a clue for exploring other processes in regards to di-muon production even from the perspective beyond the standard model. This novel method has the prospect for applications in different highenergy interactions to detect not only different possible resonance states but also for identification of exotic resonance states proposed by theories.",
