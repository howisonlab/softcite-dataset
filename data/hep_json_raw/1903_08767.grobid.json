To mimic the signal sample, in which the QX-veto condition is applied, this control sample is reduced to geometrical configurations in which the selected photon and the charged pion do not traverse opposite CHOD quadrants. The signal-trigger efficiency is obtained as the fraction of events satisfying the signal-trigger chain. The efficiency is binned as a function of the total energy released in the LKr calorimeter. To reproduce the trigger condition, which requires the total energy release to be below 20 GeV, the binned efficiency is used as an event-weight for the MC simulation of the signal.

The signal stems from the chain K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 followed by \u03c0 0 \u2192 A \u03b3. Given the kaon, charged pion, and photon 4-momenta, the squared missing mass M 2 miss = (P K \u2212 P \u03c0 \u2212 P \u03b3 ) 2 is expected to peak at the squared A mass for the signal and at zero for the dominant background, \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays with one photon undetected. A peak search has been conducted, comparing signal-selected samples and data-driven background estimates. Using the CL s method, no significant statistical excess has been identified and upper limits on the coupling strength 2 in the mass range 30-130 MeV/c 2 have been set, improving on the previous limits over the mass range 60-110 MeV/c 2 ( figure 7).",

At BaBar, positron-electron annihilations to one photon and one dark photon at the centre of mass energy of the \u03a5 resonances should produce energetic singlephoton events [8]. At NA64, dark photons produced by a 100 GeV electron beam dumped into a calorimeter are supposed to yield an excess of events with large missing energy [9]. As a consequence, models different from that of eq. (1.1) and e.g. involving suppressed darkphoton lepton couplings [10], might produce a signal at NA62 notwithstanding the NA64 JHEP05(2019)182 Figure 7. Upper limit at 90% CL from NA62 (red region) in the 2 vs M A plane with A decaying into invisible final states. The limits from the BaBar [8] (blue) and NA64 [9] (light grey) experiments are shown. The green band shows the region of the parameter space corresponding to an explanation of the discrepancy between the measured [11] and expected values of the anomalous muon magnetic moment (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 [12] in terms of a contribution from the A in the quantum loops [13,14]. The region above the black line is excluded by the agreement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (g \u2212 2) e with its expected value [15][16][17].",

The measurement of the BR for the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd by the E787 and E949 experiments [18] can be interpreted as a limit on the BR for the decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + A as a function of the A mass. However, this interpretation is modeldependent: if a mixing of the dark photon to the Z boson is introduced, the lower edge of the exclusion bound increases by a factor of 7 [19]. In the most conservative scenario, not shown in figure 7, the upper limit from E787-E949 partially overlaps with the (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 band in the mass ranges 83-113 and 176-243 MeV/c 2 .",
