High precision charm data will enable us to validate Lattice QCD calculations at the few percent level. These can then be used to make precise measurements of CKM elements, V cd and V cs , which are useful to improve the accuracy of test of the CKM unitary.",

            "text": "The charm physics potential at open-charm threshold plays important role on quark flavor physics [1]. The open-charm program at BESIII includes studies of leptonic, semileptonic, hadronic charm-meson decays, searches for neutral D mixing, CP violations, and rare and forbidden charm decays, which are sensitive to physics beyond standard Model (SM). The quark mixing parameters are fundamental constants of the SM. They determine the nine weak-current quark coupling elements of the CKM matrix [2]. Studies of the semileptonic or pure-leptonic decays of D mesons are preferred way to determine the CKM elements, |V cs | and |V cd |, since the strong interaction binding effects are parameterized by form factors or decay constants that are calculable, for example, by lattice QCD (LQCD) and QCD sum rules. On the other hand, |V cs | and |V cd | are tightly constrained when CKM matrix is assumed to be unitary. Therefore, measurements of charm semileptonic or pure-leptonic decay rates rigorously test theoretical prediction of the D meson semileptonic form factors or decay constants. High precision predictions of QCD will then remove road blocks for many weak and flavor physics measurements, such as in B decays for determinations of |V ub | and neutral B mixing parameters.",

What are the advantages to running at the open charm threshold at the BESIII experiment? The BE-SIII experiment will not be able to compete Super-B factories in statistics on charm physics, especially on the rare and forbidden decays of charm mesons. However, data taken at charm threshold still have powerful advantages over the data at \u03a5(4S ), which we list here [1,3]: 1) Charm events produced at threshold are extremely clean; 2) the measurements of absolute branching fraction can be made by using double tag events, which was first applied by the MARKIII Collaboration at SPEAR [4]. The produced \u03c8(3770) in our sample decays into a pair of DD. Reconstructing one of the D mesons with know exclusive hadronic modes while looking for decays of the other D mesons would allow us to reconstruct final states with neutrinos; 3) signal/Background is optimum at threshold; 5) Quantum coherence allow simple [5] and complex [6] methods to measure D 0D0 mixing parameters, direct CP violation and strong phase differences.",

Decay constant characterizes the stronginteraction physics at the quark-annihilation vertex. In a fully leptonic decay, they parameterize all of our essential theoretical limitations. Decay constant for B case also appears in the evaluation of box diagrams, and limit theoretical precision in calculating the neutral B meson mixing. Thus, lack of knowledge of the B 0 and B s decays constants limits the usefulness of precise measurements of B 0 \u2212B 0 and B s \u2212B s oscillations. These mixing data are our best sources of information on the CKM matrix elements V td and V ts , which are difficult to measure directly in top decay. The leptonic decay of charm meson presents an opportunity to check LQCD results for decay constants against precision measurements.

Preliminary results of branching fractions are listed in Table 3, and comparisons with results from PDG2012 [9] and CLEO-c results [13] are also made. In order to measure form factor, partial decay rates are measured in different q 2 bins.D 0 \u2192 K + e \u2212 \u03bd candidates are divided into nine q 2 bins, whileD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + e \u2212 \u03bd candidates are divided into seven q 2 bins. Signal yields in each q 2 bin are obtained by fitting U distributions in that q 2 range. Using an efficiency matrix versus q 2 , obtained from Monte-Carlo simulation, and combining with tag yields and tag efficiencies, the partial decay rates are obtained, as shown in Fig. 5. The values of q 2 -dependent form factors in each q 2 bin can be extracted from the measured partial decay rates as shown in Fig. 6. These data can be fitted with different parameterizations of the form factors, and the fit can distinguish between form  Figure 5: Partial decay rates measurement using individual tag modes (points) and all tag modes combined (histogram) for decay ofD 0 \u2192 K + e \u2212 \u03bd (left) andD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + e \u2212 \u03bd (right).

From the short distance contributions, the decay rate for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is predicted to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u221211 [18,19,20]. However, the long distance contributions significantly enhance the decay rate which is estimated to be (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10 \u22128 [19,20]. This decay could be enhanced by new physics (NP) effects which lead to contributions at loop level [21,22]. For instance, in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the calculation shows that the decay rate for c \u2192 u\u03b3 transition could be 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , which is one to two orders of magnitudes enhanced relative to the SM rate, by considering gluino exchange [21].",

Then we use the measured D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay rate to do the normalization and background estimation for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 measurement. Figure 8 shows the beamconstraint mass distribution of the observed \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 signal events and comparison with MC simulations of the expected backgrounds. The fit to the beam-constraint mass yields 4081 \u00b1 117 signal events. With the total reconstruction efficiency of 23.3%, the preliminary efficiency-corrected yield of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 based on our \u03c8(3770) data set is 17521\u00b1500(stat)\u00b11559(syst) events ( the estimation of the systematic uncertainty can be found in Ref. [25]).  We analyze D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and Fig. 9 shows \u2206E distribution based on the \u03c8(3770) data set, where \u2206E is the energy difference between reconstructed energy of D meson and beam energy. The signal candidates should be peak near zero, therefore, no significant signal events are observed. We perform a maximum-likelihood fit to the \u2206E distribution. In the fit, the signal shape is fixed by the corresponding MC shape. The background shape consists of three parts; MC-based shape to represent the contamination from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 whose size is also fixed based on our own observation; a 1st order polynominal that covers the contamination from Bhabha events which appear smoothly over the entire \u2206E spectrum; a 1st order exponential polynominal, corresponding to the rest of the backgrounds. The fit yields \u22122.9 \u00b1 7.1 signal events. This translates into an upper limit of 11 events at 90% C.L. based on the Bayesian method. Including the estimated total systematic uncertainty, we arrive at B(D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)/B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) < 5.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at 90% C.L.. With the known value of B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) [9], this corresponds to B(D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) < 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .",

While we are waiting for BESIII to take more data at \u221a s = 3.773 GeV, there is an alternate analysis approach that is unique to our data sample. The produced \u03c8(3770) in our sample decays into a pair of D 0D0 . Reconstructing one of the D 0 mesons with known exclusive modes while searching for D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in the other D 0 decay would yield an almost backgroundfree environment, except for the irreducible contamination from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 for which we have control. Such a study is also currently under way. We also explore other rare charm decays in the future with more dataset at the BESIII experiment.",
