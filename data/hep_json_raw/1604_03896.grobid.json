Studies of hadrons containing a heavy quark play a special role since the heavy quark symmetry can be exploited, for example to relate properties of charm hadrons to beauty hadrons. Measurements of the masses and mass splittings between the ground and excited states of beauty and charm hadrons provide a valuable probe of the interquark potential [1].",

            "text": "There are a number of b baryon states that contain both beauty and strange quarks. The singly strange states form isodoublets: \u039e 0 b (bsu) and \u039e \u2212 b (bsd). Theoretical estimates of the properties of these states are available (see, e.g., refs. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]). There are five known \u039e b states which, in the constituent quark model, correspond to five of the six low-lying states that are neither radially nor orbitally excited: one isodoublet of weakly-decaying ground states (\u039e 0 b and \u039e \u2212 b ) with J P = 1 2 + , one isodoublet (\u039e 0 b and \u039e \u2212 b ) with J P = 1 2 + but different symmetry properties from the ground states, and one isodoublet (\u039e * 0 b and \u039e * \u2212 b ) with J P = 3 2 + . The large data samples collected at the Large Hadron Collider have allowed these states to be studied in detail in recent years. These studies include precise measurements of the masses and lifetimes of the \u039e 0 b and \u039e \u2212 b baryons [13,14] by the LHCb collaboration, the observation of a peak in the \u039e \u2212 b \u03c0 + mass spectrum interpreted as the \u039e * 0 b baryon [15] by the CMS collaboration, and the observation of two structures in the \u039e 0 b \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, consistent with the \u039e \u2212 b and \u039e * \u2212 b baryons [16] by LHCb. 1 The \u039e 0 b state was not observed by CMS; it is assumed to be too light to decay into \u039e \u2212 b \u03c0 + . In this paper, we present the results of a study of the \u039e \u2212 b \u03c0 + mass spectrum, where the \u039e \u2212 b baryon is reconstructed through its decay to \u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u2212 , with \u039e 0 c \u2192 pK \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 + .",

We observe a single peak in the \u039e \u2212 b \u03c0 + mass spectrum, consistent with the state reported in ref. [15]. A precise determination of its mass and the first determination of a non-zero natural width are reported. We also measure the relative production rate between the \u039e * 0 b and \u039e \u2212 b baryons in the LHCb acceptance. The LHCb detector [17,18] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [19], which consists of a hardware stage (L0), based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex which is significantly displaced from all primary pp vertices and for which the scalar p T sum of the charged particles is large. At least one particle should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with coming from any of the PVs. A multivariate algorithm [20] is used to identify secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron. Only events that fulfil these criteria are retained for this analysis.",

All tracks used to reconstruct the \u039e \u2212 b candidate are required to have good track fit quality, have p T > 100 MeV/c, and have particle identification information consistent with the hypothesis assigned. The large lifetime of the \u039e \u2212 b baryon is exploited to reduce combinatorial background by requiring all of its final-state decay products to have \u03c7 2 IP > 4 with respect to all of the PVs in the event, where \u03c7 2 IP , the impact parameter \u03c7 2 , is -2 - defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the PV with and without the particle under consideration. The \u039e 0 c candidates are required to have invariant mass within 20 MeV/c 2 of the known value [30], corresponding to about three times the mass resolution. To further suppress background, the \u039e \u2212 b candidate must have a trajectory that points back to one of the PVs (\u03c7 2 IP \u2264 10) and must have a decay vertex that is significantly displaced from the PV with respect to which it has the smallest \u03c7 2 IP (decay time > 0.2 ps and flight distance \u03c7 2 > 100). The invariant mass spectra of selected \u039e 0 c and \u039e \u2212 b candidates are displayed in figure 1.",

Other than the first two systematic uncertainties described below, all are determined by making variations to the baseline selection or fit procedure, repeating the analysis, and taking the maximum change in \u03b4m or \u0393. A small correction (16 keV, estimated with pseudoexperiments) to \u0393 is required due to the systematic underestimation of the width in a fit with limited yield; an uncertainty of the same size is assigned. This correction is already included in the value of \u0393 quoted earlier. The limited size of the sample of simulated events leads to uncertainties on the resolution function parameters. These uncertainties are propagated to the final results using the full covariance matrix. We assign a systematic uncertainty for a particular class of events with multiple \u039e * 0 b candidates in which the \u039e \u2212 b or \u039e 0 c baryon is misreconstructed. This uncertainty is determined by applying a limited multiple candidate rejection procedure in which only one \u039e 0 b candidate is accepted per event (but may be combined with multiple pions). The robustness of the resolution model is verified with control samples of \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u039e 0 b \u03c0 \u2212 (see ref. [16]) and D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + ; based on these tests, the uncertainty is assessed by increasing the \u039e * 0 b resolution width by 11%. This is the dominant uncertainty on \u0393. An alternative background description is used in the fit to check the dependence of the signal parameters on the background model. The calibration of the momentum scale has an uncertainty of 0.03% [33,34], the effect of which is propagated to the mass and width of the \u039e * 0 b baryon. As in ref. [16], this is validated by measuring m(D * + ) \u2212 m(D 0 ) in a large sample of D * + , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + decays. The mass difference agrees with a recent BaBar measurement [35,36] within 6 keV/c 2 , corresponding to 1.3\u03c3 when including the mass scale uncertainty for that decay. Finally, the dependence of the results on the relativistic Breit-Wigner lineshape is tested: other values of the assumed angular momentum (spin 0, 2) and radial parameter (1-5 GeV \u22121 ) of the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factor are used, and an alternative parameterisation of the mass-dependent width (from appendix A of ref. [31]) is tested.",

The \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u039e 0 c K \u2212 contribution is also described by the sum of two Crystal Ball functions with a common mean. Its shape parameters are fixed to the values from simulation, and the fractional yield relative to that of \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u2212 is fixed to 3.1%, based on previous studies of this mode [14].

The threshold and shape parameters are fixed based on simulation, and the resolution is fixed to 14 MeV/c 2 , the approximate mass resolution for signal decays. The yield is freely varied in the fit. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function with freely varying shape parameter and yield. To match the criteria used for the \u039e * 0 b selection, only \u039e \u2212 b candidates within \u00b160 MeV/c 2 of the known mass contribute to the yield, which is found to be N (\u039e \u2212 b ) = 808 \u00b1 32.

Fit quality requirements on the \u03c0 + track lead to an additional correction of (\u22121.5 \u00b1 1.5)%. The simulation is used to estimate the loss of \u039e * 0 b efficiency from decays in which the \u03c0 + is reconstructed but has p T < 100 MeV/c. This loss, 2.7%, is already included in the efficiency, and does not require an additional correction. Since the simulation reproduces the p T spectrum well for p T > 100 MeV/c, we assign half of the value, 1.4%, as a systematic uncertainty associated with the extrapolation to p T < 100 MeV/c. Finally, the limited sample sizes of simulated events contribute an uncertainty of 2.4% to the relative efficiency.
