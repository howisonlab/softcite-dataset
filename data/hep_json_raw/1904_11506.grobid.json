In this article I first describe the theoretical basis and the approximations needed to get to any of the generators. I also discuss the strengths and limitations of theoretical models used to describe semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus reactions. I then confront present day's generators with this theoretical basis by detailed discussions of the various reaction processes. Finally, as examples, I then show for various experiments results of the generator GiBUU for lepton semi-inclusive cross sections as well as particle spectra. I also discuss features of these cross sections in terms of the various reaction components, with predictions for DUNE. Finally, I argue for the need for a new neutrino generator that respects our present-day knowledge of both nuclear theory and nuclear reactions and is as much state-of-the-art as the experimental equipment. I outline some necessary requirements for such a new generator.",

            "text": "Electron scattering on nuclei has been an active field of nuclear physics research over many decades. It has increased our knowledge about the response of a nuclear manybody system to the electromagnetic interaction [1]. At relatively low energies (10s of MeV) collective excitations of the nucleus are dominant, at higher energies (100 MeV) quasielastic reactions on individual nucleons become essential [2], at still higher energies (100s of MeV) one enters the regime of nucleon resonance excitations and finally, at the highest energies (10s of GeV), the reactions explore the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) regime [3]. Originally unexpected phenomena such as 2p2h excitations [4], in-medium spectral functions [5,6], short-range correlations [7] and spectroscopic factors [8] and the change of parton distributions inside the nucleus, as showing up in the EMC effect [9], have been explored. For all of these features not only the incoming beam energy is important, but in addition also the momentum transfer.",

            "text": "It is, therefore, natural to extend these studies to reactions with neutrinos where the axial coupling, typical for weak interactions, offers a new degree of freedom to explore [10]. Indeed, such studies were originally motivated by the interest in the axial response of nuclear many-body systems. In the first such studies, nearly 50 years ago, the nucleus was described as an unbound system of freely moving nucleons with their momenta determined by the Fermi-gas distribution [11,12]. First steps beyond that simple model were studies where the nucleus was described as a bound system with a mean-field potential [13,14,15,16] and excitations were treated by the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [17,18,19,20]. More recently, even ab-initio calculations of the electroweak response of nuclei have become possible [21]. In general, neutrinoinduced reactions exhibit the same characteristics as the electron-induced reactions. The same reaction subprocesses as described above also are present here. The only difference being the additional presence of an axial amplitude in all processes; the final state interactions are the same [22] if the incoming kinematical conditions (energy-and momentum-transfer) are identical.",

In electron-induced reactions the incoming beam energy is very accurately known and the momentum transfer can be measured with the help of magnetic spectrometers. Both of these observables are not available for neutrinos. Because neutrino beams are produced through the secondary decay of pion and kaons, first produced in a p+A reaction, their energies are not sharp, but smeared out over a wide range. For example, for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [23] the energy distributions peaks at about 2 GeV, but has long tails all the way down to zero energy and up to 30 GeV. In a charged current (CC) reaction the outgoing lepton's energy and angle can be measured, but since the incoming energy is not known, also the momentum transfer is experimentally not available. This is per se a challenge for any comparison of theory with experimental results since the theory calculations have to be performed at many different energies.",

To perform this extrapolation and reconstruction socalled neutrino generators have been constructed early on. These generators try to take not only the initial neutrino-nucleon interaction into account, but also the quite essential final state interactions. A good review of generators presently used by experiments is given in [33]. There it is also pointed out that generators are also needed for simulations of practical importance, e.g. for acceptance studies and for handling the effects of the typically quite large, extended targets. While the generator NEUT [34] is primarily being used by the T2K experiment, the generator GENIE [35,36] has become widely used by groups connected to Fermilab experiments, such as MicroBooNE, NOvA and MINERvA. In addition, a generator named NuWro [37] is being used for comparisons of experiment with calculations. Also a transport theoretical framework, GiBUU [29,30], for general nuclear reactions can be used as a generator of neutrino interactions with nuclei.",

At t = 0 one starts with n(0) = N \u2022 A test particles, where A is the number of physical particles and N is the number of ensembles (test particles per physical particle). More details about the numerical treatment of the Vlasov and collision dynamics can be found in [30]. While this method is well established for the drift term of the BUU equation the collision term requires some more refinement. Here one has often just used a geometrical argument to relate a cross section between two particles \u03c3 = \u03c0d 2 to an interaction distance d. This recipe poses a problem when the energies of the interacting particles become relativistic since then the distance seen from either one of the two particles may be different in their respective restframes because there are two different eigentimes \u00a7 For bosons, e.g. pions, the equation actually looks slightly different, see [30] for the two particles involved whereas the equation itself contains only the laboratory time. However, in the context of heavy-ion collisions approximate schemes have been developed that minimize this problem; these same methods can also be used in neutrino generators. Other schemes involve interactions between all particles in a given phasespace cell [48]; any relativistic deficiencies can be minimized that way. The actual choice of a particular reaction channel is then done by a cross section weighted random decision.",

The reaction products of this very first reaction then traverse the nuclear volume until they leave the nucleus on their way to the detector. This time-development suggests to invoke the so-called factorization of the whole reaction into a first, initial process and a final state interaction process. The factorization is, however, not perfect. The wave functions of the outgoing nucleons from the first, initial interaction, and thus the cross sections for this initial interaction, are influenced by the potentials present in that final state. The subsequent propagation of particles then takes place in this very same potential.",

For example, in some versions of GENIE, NEUT and NuWro the spectral functions of nucleons are taken into account in the description of the initial state for the very first interaction. These spectral functions contain implicitly information on potentials and off-shellness. However, the outgoing nucleons move freely on straight lines, i.e. without experiencing a potential, and only their energies are corrected by some constant binding energy. This is obviously not consistent. A consistent theory requires to use the full off-shell transport for these 'collision-broadened' nucleons if one is interested not only in semi-inclusive cross sections, but also in quantities such as the final momentum-distribution of the hit nucleon.",

In Continuum RPA (CRPA) calculations this group showed that RPA effects overall are significantly smaller and play a significant role only at small Q 2 and small energy transfers (\u2248 10s of MeV) when a realistic ground state potential is used. This result provides a justification for using mean field potentials in generators without any RPA correlations. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the double-differential cross section for the QE scattering of the MicroBooNE flux on 40 Ar, calculated on one hand within CRPA [60] and on the other hand -without any RPA correlations -within GiBUU. The overall agreement between the models is quite good and illustrates the small influence of RPA correlations on double differential semi-inclusive cross sections. Since in the calculations of Ref. [57] the strong RPA effect was nearly canceled by an equally strong, but with opposite sign, effect of 2p2h interactions to reach agreement with experiment one could speculate that also the 2p2h contributions were overestimated in a calculations that starts with a free, non-interacting ground state.",

This can be seen in Figs. 8 and 9 in Ref. [62] which show semi-classical spectral functions calculated as discussed above.

In both reaction types the target nucleus remains in its ground state. Such processes can be described by a coherent sum over the individual nucleon amplitudes [65] and thus depends crucially on a phase-coherence between all nucleons. This coherence cannot be described by the quantum-kinetic transport equations (or any MC-based generator) which describe the incoherent time-evolution of single particle phase-space densities.

Theoretical investigations of coherent neutrinoinduced pion production exploit the fact that the incoming gauge boson 'sees' a coherent superposition of all nucleons and, therefore work with the overall form factor of the target nucleus [64,68].

This is not too surprising since the width of the QE peak is determined by p F and its position can be shifted away from the free peak position by a potenial.

This led to the quite successful SUSAv2 model [52,72] which combines a relativistic mean field description of the target nucleus with a calculation using the Relativistic Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (RPWIA) at higher energies.

Nuclear many body theory (NMBT) has allowed to calculate that function for the nuclear hole states in the nuclear ground state to a high precision [5]. By invoking the impulse approximation one then uses this hole spectral function to describe the initial state in a QE scattering event; the final state in this method is usually assumed to be that of a free nucleon (impulse approximation) [2]. The calculations thus contain effects in the nuclear ground state that go beyond the mean-field approximation, e.g. shortrange correlations.

Nevertheless, the generators GENIE, NEUT and NuWro have implemented a so-called spectral function option into their description of QE scattering. In this option the very first, initial interaction is described by a cross section for QE scattering obtained by using a spectral function. Such a procedure is dubious since it uses a very different ground state for the QE scattering than for the other processes. Furthermore, in these generators the potential for the outgoing particles is absent and there is, therefore, a discontinuity between the initial state potential, hidden in the spectral function, and the final state potential. The method can thus work only in a limited kinematic range where the outgoing nucleon's kinetic energy is about 250 -300 MeV so that the momentum-dependent potential nearly vanishes (see Figure 2).",

Their main strength lies in calculating lepton semi-inclusive cross sections at relatively low energies since they become the better the closer they stay to the nuclear ground state. There these calculations have the potential to describe not only the inclusive contributions of true one-particle QE events but also admixtures of 2p2h events and short-range correlations (SRC) that could overlap with the former. Indeed, they have recently reproduced experimental results for the semi-inclusive QE response in NC events on light nuclei [75]. The method, so far, does not yield any hole spectral functions and can thus not be combined with the impulse approximation, as in the NMBT calculation,s to overcome the limitations of its non-relativistic character. It also does not contain any inelastic excitations nor does it give any information on the final state of the reaction, except for the outgoing lepton's properties, and thus cannot be used in any generator without invoking further assumptions.",

In electron-induced reactions the measurable energy transfer can be used to distinguish at least the bulk parts of QE scattering and resonance excitations, for example. In neutrino-induced reactions, however, the beam energy and thus also the energy transfer is smeared (see discussion in the introduction). Thus, any experimentally observed events in the QE region are always mixtures of different reaction processes with very similar final, asymptotic states. At the lower beam energy of the T2K experiment, for example, QE and pion production through the \u2206 resonance, overlap. This implies that the QE cross section alone cannot be measured in neutrino-induced reactions. This is also true for so-called 0-pion (sometimes also called QE-like) events without any pions in the final state. In this case pions could have been first produced through \u2206 excitation and then reabsorbed through FSI. Detailed analyses show that the latter events amount to about 10% in the T2K energy range (\u2248 700) MeV [76].",

            "text": "The simplest process that can take place in a neutrino-nucleus reaction is that of quasielastic (QE) scattering in which the incoming neutrino interacts with just one nucleon. In theoretical descriptions one usually assumes that the cross section for that process on a Fermi-moving nucleon is the same as that on a free nucleon, except for a necessary Lorentz transformation to the moving nucleon's rest frame (\"impulse approximation\"). Assuming a Fermi gas momentum distribution for the initial nucleons and free movement for the final state particles allows to give an analytical expression for this cross section [12,11]. Possible off-shell effects are often treated by a shift of the energy transfer [2] In the early work by Smith and Moniz [11] there was the assumption hidden in that cross section that the binding energy of the hit nucleon before and after the collision can be neglected; only possible Pauli-blocking of the final state is taken into account. Binding energy effects are then simulated by a change of the energy of the final state nucleon which is assumed to be free [77]; sometimes also the energy transfer is modified [2] mainly to correct for the target recoil. Using the so-called impulse approximation then not just inclusive cross sections but also properties of the outgoing nucleons can be calculated. This impulse approximation makes it possible to use the spectral functions obtained from nuclear many-body theory for a description of the initial state while the final state is still assumed to be free. In terms of the general structure of the transport equations in Section 2 this procedure corresponds to a mixture of the full theory as outlined there and the quasiparticle approximation without potentials. The very first interaction is described by the interaction of the incoming neutrino with correlated and bound target nucleons described by broadened spectral functions. The following transport of the initial final state through the nuclear environment then proceeds as if the nucleons were unbound and \u03b4-function like in their energy-momentum dispersion relation.",

Such a momentum-dependence of the single-particle potential has been known to affect the position of the QE peak [78,79]. In [73] the authors have demonstrated that such a potential has a major influence on the location of the QE peak, in particular at low momentum transfers where the momentum dependence of the potential is strongest.

The calculations reported in [57], on the other hand, were relativistic, but involved approximations in evaluating the momentumspace integrals and in neglecting the direct-exchange interference terms in the matrix elements. Both models start from an unbound ground state assuming a local Fermigas momentum distribution. Intrinsic excitations of the nucleon are limited to the \u2206 resonance; this limits the applicability of these models to the MicroBooNE, T2K energy regime.",

These authors evaluated all the relevant diagrams involving 2p2h interactions in the nucleon and \u2206 energy regime, using a somewhat simplified N N interaction. The calculation is fully relativistic and includes all the interference terms. Earlier calculations had assumed that the 2p2h contribution was purely transverse. The new calculations by Megias et al verify that for electrons. For neutrinos they also obtain a longitudinal contribution although the latter is small relative to the transverse one [72,92]. An open problem in these calculations is that only the real part of the \u2206 propagator, which appears in all the relevant graphs, is taken into account. The agreement with electron data, usually assumed to be an essential test of an description of neutrino-nucleus data, is quite bad if the full propagator is used.",

The Wigner-Eckart theorem then allows to connect the transition matrix elements for electrons (\u223c \u03c4 3 ) with those for neutrinos (\u223c \u03c4 \u00b1 ). This connection was originally derived by Walecka [102] for single particle processes but it also holds for the 2p2h processes considered here because the relevant transition operators can again be expressed in terms of irreducible tensors of SU(2) [105]. As already mentioned this connection depends on the assumption that neutrino processes excite just the isobaric analogues of states reached in electron scattering. It would thus be very interesting to verify the presence of this isospin factor in actual data. So far most of neutrino data were obtained for the T = 0 nuclei C and O. It will, therefore, be very interesting to see the effects of this factor for the isospin asymmetric nucleus 40 Ar for which T = 2. To experimentally verify this will require a very good knowledge of the incoming neutrino flux and small other uncertainties (see discussion in [56,106]).",

In particular at the higher energies of the MINERvA or DUNE experiment pion-production, through resonances or DIS, makes up for about 1/2 -2/3 of the total interaction cross section and even at T2K it amounts to up to 1/3 of the total. Therefore it must be under quantitative control in the generators used to extract cross sections and neutrino mixing properties from such experiments. Very recently, two comparisons of the generators NEUT (with charged pion -nucleus data) [107] and GENIE (with MINERvA neutrino-induced pion production data) [108] have shown that major discrepancies of these generators with the data exist that cannot be tuned away. Neutrino-induced pion production on nuclei can -similar to the QE scattering description -be treated by describing the pion production on single nucleons that are bound and Fermi-moving. For the lower energy transfers pion production proceeds predominantly through the \u2206 resonance. The binding energy correction is then usually handled by assigning a omplex density-dependent selfenergy to the \u2206 which takes care of such effects as Pauli-blocking and collisional broadening. The pion production cross section in the resonance region is then obtained as a coherent sum over resonance and background amplitudes [109,110,111]. The models of Leitner et al [109,110] and Hernandez [111] are essentially identical and differ only in their treatment of the background amplitude.",

This is true for electromagnetic interactions where only vector couplings appear. For neutrinos, in addition axial couplings are present which require the same number of formfactors again.

The helicity amplitudes are determined in, e.g., the MAID analysis [116]; the connection between these helicity amplitudes and the vector form factors is given in [115]. Current conservation here imposes a constraint on one of the vector form factors to vanish (C V 6 = 0). This is the approach followed in GiBUU. For the axial form factors the situation is less well determined since the quality of these data is not sufficient to determine all four axial form factors C A i (Q 2 ). Already in Ref. [117] it was noticed that C A 5 gives the dominant contribution. C A 6 can be related to C A 5 by PCAC [118] leaving also in the axial sector only three form factors. In addition, C A 3 is set to zero based on an old analysis by Adler [119], whereas C A 4 is linked to C A 5 . Based on these relations all theoretical analyses have so far used the axial form factor C A 5 (Q 2 ) (see Eq. (18) in [109]) with various parameterizations. The latter usually go beyond that of a simple dipole [109,110,118,111] and have been obtained by fitting the neutrino pion-production data on an elementary target available from two experiments performed in the middle 80's at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) [120] and at Brookhaven National Laboratory [121].",

The analysis of these invariant mass data together with the experimental d\u03c3/dQ 2 distributions then led the authors of [122] to conclude that probably the BNL data [121] were too high. This has been confirmed by a reanalysis of the old data by Wilkinson et al [123] who used the QE data obtained in the same experiment for a new flux calibration. After that flux recalibration the BNL data agree with the ANL data within experimental uncertainties. There remains an uncertainty, however, that is connected with possible final state effects in the extraction of pion production cross sections on the nucleon from data obtained with a deuterium target [124]. In a very recent calculation that covers a wider kinematical regime Nakamura et al have tried to correct the old bubble chamber data on pion production for Fermi motion and final state effects [125]. They find in particular at lower neutrino energies corrections of the order of 10 -20 %. New, more precise measurements on elementary targets are needed to verify this result.",

For electro-production of pions t-channel processes provide a background to the resonance contribution. The total cross section is then given by the coherent sum of s-channel and t-channel amplitudes. Analogously, also for the case of neutrino-interactions there is a background contribution due to Born-type diagrams where the incoming W + (for neutrino-induced CC pion production) interacts with the nucleon line W N \u2192 N \u03c0. The Lagrangian for this latter interaction can be obtained from effective field theory, for low energies up to about the \u2206 region [122,126,127]. The description for the \u2206 region obtained with this model is quite good, but for the higher-lying resonances one has to resort to modeling both the resonance and the background contributions. Since for higher lying resonances there is even less experimental information available all models simply use dipole parameterizations for the resonance transition form factors with the strength obtained from PCAC [122].",

The generators GENIE, NEUT and NuWro all violate this time-reversal invariance condition by using quite different models for pion production and absorption. For example, in these standard generators the production is described by resonance excitations within the Rein-Segal model, whereas pion reabsorption is handled by a very different model, mostly the pion-absorption cascade of the Valencia group [129]. This is particularly dangerous if then -as usual in the generators -tuning parameters are introduced that allow to tune pion production and pion absorption independently from each other. This obviously introduces artificial degrees of freedom. The amount of 'stuck-pion events', i.e. events in which a pion was first produced and then reabsorbed in the same target nucleus, are most sensitive to any imbalance between pion production and pion absorption. The generator NuWRo uses a model with a formation-time parameter for the emitted pion even in the \u2206 resonance region [130]. This gives additional tuning degrees of freedom for pion absorption which, however, have no physical basis: In the resonance region the time-development of pion production is governed by the resonance width; there is no room for additional parameters.",

This is an oversimplification since over the last 30 years the study of nucleon excitations has shown that up to invariant masses of about 2 GeV there are many resonances that also decay into two and even more pions; the 2 pion threshold opens at a mass of about 1.5 GeV. Only above about 2 GeV the individual nucleon resonances start to overlap and the DIS regime starts. Furthermore, nucleon resonance excitations and DIS have very different Q 2 dependencies such that DIS is connected with events with Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 .",

In the pQCD regime, i.e. Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 , these structure functions can be written down in terms of parton distribution functions. In regions, where pQCD does not yet provide the correct description, parameterizations of these structure functions have been obtained by fits to semi-inclusive cross section data. The high-energy event generator PYTHIA [145] is then often used to actually provide also mass-and energydistributions of the final state. When using this framework for neutrino-nucleus reactions one is faced with the complication that the target nucleon is bound, i.e. off shell. Various schemes have been investigated to deal with this problem; it was found that these effects play only a small, but visible role at intermediate energies [146].",

The cross sections for these processes can be affected by the nuclear medium with the changes depending on the local density and the momentum of the interacting particles [151].

The nucleons in the target nucleus carry energy and momentum which have to enter into the overall energy-conservation of the primary interaction, both in the initial and the final state.

While all angular bins look very similar, with a QE scattering peak at about T \u00b5 = 0.5 GeV, the most forward bin (cos \u03b8 = 0.975) shows a different behavior, with a long, flat shoulder out to higher T \u00b5 . This behavior shows up already in the individual QE and \u2206 contributions shown separately in the figure. It is due to the higher energy tail in the incoming neutrino flux. In addition, also DIS starts to contribute at about T \u00b5 = 1 GeV (not explicitly shown in the figure). Note that the 2p2h contribution is essentially absent in the most forward bin. This reflects the transverse character of this reaction type in GiBUU.",

The cross section is now presented in wider bins than the one shown before for the T2K experiment. As a consequence, the first bin is centered less forward. The flat behavior of the total cross section in the forward bin for T2K thus does not show up here in the plot of the double differential distribution for MicroBooNE. Otherwise, the results are quite similar, with the exception of the 2p2h contribution that is now larger than for T2K, reflecting the non-zero isospin of the target nucleus 40 Ar (T = 2). It will be most interesting to see if this increase in the 2p2h strength is indeed borne out by the data that are presently being taken [170]. A verification would give direct information on the states that are excited in a neutrino-nucleus 2p2h reaction since the isospin factor emerges under the assumption that neutrino-induced reactions populate the isobaric analogue states of electron scattering experiments.",

Both together make up more than 3/4 of the total cross section in that bin. The 2p2h contribution is comparatively negligible (about 5% of the total); at the peak of the total cross section the 2p2h contribution is the smallest of all. DIS accounts for less than 10 % in the   defines an optimal kinematical region for studies of DIS in neutrino-induced reactions. Figure 7 gives the Q 2 distribution, where Q 2 here is calculated from Q 2 = 4E \u03bd E \u00b5 sin 2 (\u03b8 \u00b5 /2) . Since Q 2 cannot directly be measured, but must be reconstructed, this is a less direct observable than the double differential cross sections. Nevertheless it is interesting to see that the inclusive Q 2 distributions reach out to fairly large Q 2 while the distribution for 0-pion events dies out at Q 2 \u2248 1.5 GeV 2 . The latter reflects the fact that in 0-pion events resonance excitations and DIS, which both dominantly decay into a nucleon and pions, are suppressed. DIS events are connected with momentum transfers Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 where they contribute significantly to the inclusive cross section. Presently, the MINERvA experiment is also analyzing data from a so-called medium energy (ME) run where the flux peaks at about 5.75 GeV. If one looks at the same distributions as before now for the medium energy energy beam in Fig. 8 one sees similar shapes for the overall cross sections. Again \u2206 excitation and QE scattering give about equal contributions to the cross section at the most forward bin. In that bin (cos \u03b8 = 0.995) the DIS contribution is larger already under the peak, but its shoulder is not so visible as in Fig. 6 because the other components are broader. It becomes dominant in the next angular bin (cos \u03b8 = 0.985) and from cos \u03b8 = 0.975 on it accounts for nearly all the cross section. Choosing only events with the outgoing muon angle > 10 degrees thus enriches the DIS events significantly. The Q 2 distribution (Fig. 9) is similar to the one at the LE flux. Again restricting the events to those with zero outgoing pions cuts the cross section by nearly a factor 2 at small Q 2 and brings the cross section down to nearly zero at Q 2 \u2248 2.5 GeV.",

Fig. 10 shows the double-differential cross section for a neutrino beam; this flux peaks at about 6 GeV  with a long, hard tail out to larger energies. It is noticeable that now even in the most forward bin (cos \u03b8 = 0.995) the largest contribution comes from DIS, which contributes about a factor of three more than QE and \u2206 processes. This is due to the fact that DIS cross sections depend approximately linearly on the incoming neutrino energy and the ArgoNeut flux has significant strength also at higher energies. These Ar data could in principle serve as a testing ground for the isospin dependence of the 2p2h component. However, this component is so small even for T = 2, compared to the dominant DIS contribution, so that there is hardly any sensitivity to its strength. Fig. 11 gives the muon momentum spectrum for the same experiment. Shown are results for a calculation with T = 2, but a calculation with T = 0 gives nearly the same curve because the overall contribution of 2p2h processes is small. Also shown is the spectrum for 0-pion events. This cross section is quite flat and significantly smaller than the inclusive one. The latter feature is due to the dominance of DIS in the fully inclusive cross section and to the fact that DIS events nearly always lead to pions in the final state.",

Transparency Before coming to the DUNE cross sections for outgoing nucleons it is interesting to look at a comparison with the transparency of nuclei for outgoing nucleons that was measured in electron-induced reactions for different targets and over a wide range of momentum-transfer Q 2 . Experimentally, the transparency was defined as a ratio of the number of nucleons in a given angular interval, chosen to be approximately symmetric around the momentum of the virtual photon, to the same number expected if there were no final state interactions. In the experimental work the latter number was obtained from Glauber or Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation calculations. The theoretical transparencies were, on the other hand, consistently obtained by running GiBUU with and without final state interactions. The comparison of GiBUU results, obtained already in 2001, with the data is shown in Fig. 13.",

This rise is due to final state interactions: While at the end of the first, initial neutrinonucleus interaction there may be only one nucleon outgoing, its collisions with other nucleons causes an 'avalanche' of nucleons. Energy conservation then requires that all these secondary particles carry lower energies. This steep rise also implies that caution has to be taken when a calorimetric energy reconstruction is performed. Typically, the detectors have a lower detection threshold of about 50 MeV [176].

For cases where there is some text, e.g. for the treatment of FSI, the discussion is superficial. The reason is probably that the generators often incorporate quite old code fragments and methods for which the basic knowledge and the original authors are no longer available. This is different for GiBUU which represents a consistent framework of theory and code, is well documented [30] and most of its primary authors are still active in the field. For a test of generators besides neutrino data themselves also data from electronuclear or photo-nuclear reactions are useful and necessary. Their initial reactions are identical with the vector part of neutrino-induced reactions and the final state interactions are the same if the incoming kinematics (energy-and momentum-transfer) are identical. Checking generators against electron or photon data is thus an indispensable requirement.",
