Both the statistical and systematic uncertainties remain below 1%, except for the t-independent contribution from the overall normalisation. This unprecedented precision allows to exclude a purely exponential differential cross-section in the range of four-momentum transfer squared 0.027 < |t| < 0.2 GeV 2 with a significance greater than 7 \u03c3 . Two extended parametrisations, with quadratic and cubic polynomials in the exponent, are shown to be well compatible with the data. Using them for the differential cross-section extrapolation to t = 0, and further applying the optical theorem, yields total crosssection estimates of (101.5 \u00b1 2.1) mb and (101.9 \u00b1 2.1) mb, respectively, in agreement with previous TOTEM measurements.",

Nonetheless, a few experiments have already reported about hints of slight deviations from this behaviour. At the ISR, for \u221a s between 21.5 GeV and 52.8 GeV, elastic pp and partly pp data have shown a change of slope [1,2] or have been better parametrised with quadratic exponential functions, e \u2212B|t|\u2212Ct 2 [3,4]. At the SppS, for \u221a s = 546 GeV, a change of slope at |t| \u2248 0.14 GeV 2 has been observed, while the inclusion of a quadratic term in the exponent did not improve the fit significantly [5]. At the Tevatron [6][7][8][9] no deviations from pure exponential functions were observed, except at larger |t| where the influence of the shoulder (\u223c 0.8 GeV 2 at \u221a s = 0.546 TeV and \u223c 0.6 GeV 2 at 1.8 and 1.96 TeV) becomes visible. At the LHC, at 7 TeV as well as at 8 TeV, all data published so far [10][11][12][13] have been compatible with a pure exponential shape.",

Thanks to its high statistics, an unprecedented precision has been reached in the region 0.027 |t| 0.2 GeV 2 . Both the statistical and systematic components of the differential cross-section uncertainty are controlled at a level below 1%, except for the overall normalisation (Section 5.2.6). Consequently, the functional form of the cross-section can be strongly constrained, thus having more impact on theoretical model building and, in particular, on the extrapolation to t = 0 used for total cross-section determination. Neglecting the influence of Coulomb scattering in the observed range, the often used purely exponential extrapolation has been found inadequate, and extended parametrisations are provided, still yielding total cross-section values compatible with the previous TOTEM results [12] at the same energy.",

In this article only the Roman Pot (RP) system, the sub-detector relevant for elastic scattering measurement, is outlined, whereas TOTEM's full experimental apparatus is described elsewhere [14]. Roman Pots are movable beam-pipe insertions that approach the LHC beam very closely in order to detect particles scattered at very small angles. They are organised in two stations placed symmetrically around the IP: one on the left side (in LHC sector 45), one on the right (sector 56). Each station is formed by two units: near (214 m from the IP) and far (220 m). Each unit includes three RPs: one approaching the beam from the top, one from the bottom and one horizontally. Each RP hosts a stack of 10 silicon strip sensors (pitch 66 \u00b5m) with a strongly reduced insensitive region at the edge facing the beam (few tens of micrometres). The sensors are equipped with trigger-capable electronics. Since elastic scattering events consist of two antiparallel protons, the detected events can have two topologies, called diagonals: 45 bottom-56 top and 45 top-56 bottom.",

The inefficiencies left are related to the inability of a RP to resolve the elastic proton track.  One such case is when a single RP cannot detect and/or reconstruct a proton track, with no correlation to other RPs. This type of inefficiency, I 3/4 , is evaluated by removing the RP from the tagging cuts (Table 2), repeating the event selection and calculating the fraction of recovered events. A typical example is given in Fig. 7, showing that the efficiency decreases gently with the vertical scattering angle. This dependence stems from the fact that protons with larger |\u03b8 * y | hit the RPs further from their edge and therefore the potentially created secondary particles have more chance to induce additional signal in the sensors and thus prevent from resolving the elastic proton track.",

One way to demonstrate this is to split the data into groups of consecutive points small enough Table 3 The elastic differential cross-section as determined in this analysis using the \"optimised\" binning. The three left-most columns describe the bins in t . The representative point gives the t value suitable for fitting [23]. The other columns are related to the differential cross-section. The four right-most columns give the leading systematic biases in d\u03c3/dt for 1 \u03c3 -shifts in the respective quantities, \u03b4s q , see Eqs. (13) and (14). The two contributions due to optics correspond to the two vectors in Eq. 8 for a linear function to approximate well the differential cross-section within each group. Then, performing straight-line fits through each group yields on average \u03c7 2 values slightly too low. Alternatively, the issue can be demonstrated as follows. The data sample is divided into several sub-samples corresponding to the same luminosity, and the analysis method described in the earlier sections is repeated for each of these sub-samples. Then, fluctuations of each bin content are determined from the several sub-samples, giving values slightly lower than the uncertainty estimates.",

The covariance matrix V is given by the sum of the statistical component V stat (statistical uncertainty squared from Table 3 on the diagonal) and the systematic component V syst (see Eq. (14)). The quality of fits is judged on the basis of several measures. The first is the value of \u03c7 2 after minimisation divided by the number of degrees of freedom (ndf). Secondly, the p-value stands for the probability that a \u03c7 2 value greater than the observed one would be drawn from the \u03c7 2 distribution with the given number of degrees of freedom. Finally, significance means the half-width of a central region that needs to be excluded from a normal distribution to get the same integrated probability as the p-value. The significance is expressed in multiples of sigma, the standard deviation of the normal distribution. Fig. 11.

The black dots represent data points with statistical uncertainty bars. The coloured continuous curves correspond to fits with parametrisation Eq.

The straight (red) line lies seemingly too high with respect to the data points, which is a consequence of the systematic degrees of freedom included in the fit: some of the effects in Fig. 9 may flatten the distribution which at the same time changes the overall normalisation. The widest error band (yellow) corresponds to the full systematic uncertainty, the hatched (brown) one includes all systematic contributions except the normalisation. Both bands are centred around the fit curve with N b = 3. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 11 shows several fits of the differential cross-section with the parametrisation in Eq. (15) and different numbers of parameters in the exponent, N b . The corresponding fit quality is given in Table 4, indicating that the purely exponential fit (N b = 1) is excluded at 7.2 \u03c3 significance.

While the central part (signal) remains essentially constant, the tails (background) are strongly suppressed with increasing number of cuts applied. This interpretation is further supported by the discriminator distributions from non-diagonal RP configurations, see the dotted curves in the figure. While these top-top or bottom-bottom configurations cannot contain any elastic signal, they are likely to have a similar share of events causing background to the presented analysis. And indeed, the figure shows a good agreement at the distribution tails. Integrating the non-diagonal curve over the signal region (see the dashed lines in the figure) yields a background estimate of 1 \u2212 B < 10 \u22124 .",
