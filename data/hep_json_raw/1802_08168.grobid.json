These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various E miss T contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall reconstructed E miss T are evaluated with various performance metrics for scale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions. The method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the E miss T scale and resolution is discussed. Results are shown based on the full 2015 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 .",

            "text": "The missing transverse momentum (E miss T ) is an important observable serving as an experimental proxy for the transverse momentum carried by undetected particles produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions measured with the ATLAS detector [1] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is reconstructed from the signals of detected particles in the final state. A value incompatible with zero may indicate not only the production of Standard Model (SM) neutrinos but also the production of new particles suggested in models for physics beyond the SM that escape the ATLAS detector without being detected. The reconstruction of E miss T is challenging because it involves all detector subsystems and requires the most complete and unambiguous representation of the hard interaction of interest by calorimeter and tracking signals. This representation is obscured by limitations introduced by the detector acceptance and by signals and signal remnants from additional pp interactions occurring in the same, previous and subsequent LHC bunch crossings (pile-up) relative to the triggered hard-scattering. ATLAS has developed successful strategies for a high-quality E miss T reconstruction focussing on the minimisation of effects introduced by pile-up for the data recorded between 2010 and 2012 (LHC Run 1) [2,3]. These approaches are the basis for the E miss T reconstruction developed for the data collected in 2015 (LHC Run 2) that is described in this paper, together with results from performance evaluations and the determination of systematic uncertainties.",

The second contribution to E miss T is from the soft-event signals consisting of reconstructed charged-particle tracks (soft signals) associated with the hard-scatter vertex defined in Appendix A but not with the hard objects. ATLAS carries out a dedicated reconstruction procedure for each kind of particle as well as for jets, casting a particle or jet hypothesis on the origin of (a group of) detector signals. These procedures are independent of one another. This means that e.g. the same calorimeter signal used to reconstruct an electron is likely also used to reconstruct a jet, thus potentially introducing double counting of the same signal when reconstructing E miss T . This issue is addressed by the explicit signal ambiguity resolution in the object-based E miss T reconstruction originally introduced in Refs.

In addition, the LAr calorimeter signals are sensitive to signal remnants from up to 24 previous bunch crossings and one following bunch crossing (out-of-time pile-up), as discussed in Refs. [6,39]. Both types of pile-up affect signals contributing to E miss T . The in-time pile-up activity is measured by the number of reconstructed primary collision vertices N PV .

Neutrinos are produced only through very rare heavy-flavour decays in the hadronic recoil. This channel can therefore be considered to have no genuine missing transverse momentum. Thus, the scale and resolution for the reconstructed E miss T are indicative of the reconstruction quality and reflect limitations introduced by both the detector and the ambiguity resolution procedure. The well-defined expectation value E miss,true T = 0 allows the reconstruction quality to be determined in both data and MC simulations. The reconstructed E miss T in this final state is also sensitive to the effectiveness of the muon-jet overlap resolution, which can be explored in this low-multiplicity environment in both data and MC simulations, with a well-defined E miss T . Events must pass one of three high-level muon triggers with different p \u03bc T thresholds and isolation requirements. The isolation is determined by the ratio of the scalar sum of p T of reconstructed tracks other than the muon track itself, in a cone of size R = 0.2 around the muon track ( p cone T ), to p ",

In addition, the E miss T resolution functions are characterised by a high level of complexity, due to the composite character of the observable. Objects with different p T -resolutions contribute, and the E miss T composition can fluctuate significantly for events from the same final state. Due to the dependence of the E miss T response on the resolution, both performance characteristics change as a function of the total event activity and are affected by pile-up. There is no universal way of mitigating these effects, due to the inability to validate in data a stable and universal calibration reference for E miss T . The E miss T reconstruction performance is therefore assessed by comparing a set of reconstructed E miss T -related observables in data and MC simulations for the same finalstate selection, with the same object and event selections applied. Systematic uncertainties in the E miss T response and resolution are derived from these comparisons and are used to quantify the level of understanding of the data from the physics models. The quality of the detector simulation is independently determined for all reconstructed jets, particles and ID tracks, and can thus be propagated to the overall E miss T uncertainty for any given event. Both the distributions of observables as well as their average behaviour with respect to relevant scales measuring the overall kinematic activity of the hard-scatter event or the pile-up activity are compared. To focus on distribution shapes rather than statistical differences in these comparisons, the overall distribution of a given observable obtained from MC simulations is normalised to the integral of the corresponding distribution in data.",

From these, specific exclusive samples are extracted by applying conditions on the number of jets reconstructed. In particular, zero jet (N jet = 0) samples without any jet with p T > 20 GeV (fully calibrated) and |\u03b7| < 4.9 are useful for exclusively studying the performance of the soft term. Samples with events selected on the basis of a non-zero number of reconstructed jets with p T > 20 GeV are useful for evaluating the contribution of jets to E miss T . While the p T response of jets is fully calibrated and provides a better measurement of the overall event p T -flow, the p T resolution for jets is affected by pile-up and can introduce a detrimental effect on E miss T reconstruction performance. Missing transverse momentum and its related observables presented in Sect. 3.1 are reconstructed for the performance evaluations shown in the following sections using a standard reconstruction configuration.

This brief glossary of terms is intended to help with the nomenclature. All terms should be interpreted in the context of E miss T reconstruction and may have other interpretations in other contexts. E miss T reconstruction: Using this nomenclature usually encompasses the reconstruction of a set of observables comprising the missing transverse momentum vector E miss T , its components E miss x(y) , and its absolute value E miss T . In addition, the scalar sum E T of the p T of all kinematic objects contributing to E miss T is calculated. The calculation of these variables is described in detail in Eqs. (1)-(4) in Sect. 3.1. Hard scatter and primary vertices: The hardest pp interaction in a given event is referred to as the hard scatter. It is normally associated with a reconstructed hard-scatter vertex, which is considered the hardest vertex among all reconstructed primary vertices in this event. The hard-scatter vertex is defined as the one with the largest sum of p 2 T of tracks associated with it. The other primary vertices are assumed to be produced by in-time pile-up interactions. The variable N PV denotes the number of reconstructed primary collision vertices in the event.",

In all cases the final objects are characterised by a kinematic threshold and reconstruction quality requirements. Both the reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the ID and topo-clusters from the calorimeter are used as the input signals for these objects. In the context of E miss T reconstruction, the use of the same detector signals by different hard objects is excluded, see details in Sect. 3. The finally accepted hard event objects give rise to the hard term in E miss T reconstruction. Soft event and soft term: All detector signals recorded for one triggered event and not used by the hard objects discussed above can be considered as soft signals contributing to E miss T . They include signals or signal traces from scattered soft particles arising from the underlying event accompanying the hard-scatter interaction, or from statistically completely independent pile-up interactions producing diffuse particle emissions in the same bunch crossing. In addition, signals from particles and jets which do not satisfy the hard-object quality criteria, or are below the kinematic threshold, can be included in the soft event. The reference E miss T reconstruction configuration for the results presented in Sects. 6 and 7 uses reconstructed ID tracks from the soft event to form the soft term in E miss T reconstruction, with the track selection details outlined under priority (6) in Table 1 in Sect. 3. Alternative configurations employ topo-clusters from the calorimeter, see Table 2 in Appendix A. Table 2 summarises the E miss T reconstruction configurations employing only ID tracks, or using topo-clusters for the soft term.
