The experiment was carried out at a synchrotron radiation facility using a \"light shining through a wall (LSW)\" technique. For this purpose, we have developed a novel pulsed-magnet system, composed of multiple racetrack-magnets and a transportable power supply. It produces fields of about 10 T over 0.8 m with a high repetition rate of 0.2 Hz and yields a new method of probing vacuum with high intensity fields. The data obtained with a total of 27,676 pulses provide a limit on the ALP-two-photon coupling constant that is more stringent by a factor of 5.2 compared to a previous x-ray LSW limit for the ALP mass 0.1 eV.",

            "text": "Photons are one of the most fundamental objects in physics, and their direct interaction does not take place in vacuum because of their electrical neutrality. However, a nonlinear effect of quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts the two-photon interaction (TPI), intermediated by a virtual electron-positron loop [1]. This effect is currently being studied in many experiments by using a scattering method [2][3][4][5] or by measuring vacuum magnetic birefringence (VMB) [6][7][8][9]. While this QED cross section is quite small [10,11], the existence of possible new scalar or pseudoscalar particles could provide additional contributions via the Primakoff effect [12,13]. The first observation of TPI with an elementary scalar field was provided by the recent discovery of Higgs boson, decaying with H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [14,15]. Another well-known example for a pseudoscalar field is a neutral pion decay \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [16]. Therefore, searches for new (pseudo-)scalar bosons with a small mass like axions [17][18][19][20][21] and axionlike particles (ALPs) [22][23][24][25] are important in the context of particle physics [26], and their contribution to TPI may also reveal a new aspect of photons.",

Up to now, a large number of laboratorial searches for ALPs have been carried out with a \"light shining through a wall (LSW)\" technique [27], where E is provided as real photons from a light source and B as virtual photons from an external magnetic field, so that the field direction coincides with the polarization of the incident light.

However, unlike invisible axion models [39][40][41][42], ALP mass m a and g a\u03b3\u03b3 are not bound with each other. Thus, new parameter spaces have been searched with various photon energies (see [43] and references therein). To probe a higher mass region than that of laser experiments, the use of synchrotron x-rays was proposed [44,45]. The photon energy is typically higher by 3-4 orders of magnitude compared to optical photons. The first x-ray LSW search was carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) with superconducting magnets, significantly extending the limit on g a\u03b3\u03b3 up to around 1 eV [46]. While searches for ALP flux from the Sun have also probed this mass region [47][48][49][50][51][52][53], the flux estimation inevitably relys on a solar model [54][55][56][57][58][59] and its complex magnetic activity [60]. ALP interaction with the solar magnetic field has been implied by its x-ray spectra, coronal heating, and cyclic luminosity variation for ALP masses around 20 meV [61][62][63][64], showing the importance of complementary searches using terrestrial and extra-terrestrial x-ray sources [46].",

            "text": "In this Letter, we describe a new method of searching for ALPs at a synchrotron radiation (SR) facility by applying highly repetitive pulsed fields. The key technology of the experiment is a magnet system. Its requirements are (i) field direction transverse to the light propagation, (ii) high field intensity, (iii) large field length, and (iv) accommodation in an x-ray hutch with its size typically \u223c 3-4 m. The last one is a practical aspect of x-ray experiments and limits the use of large bending magnets that were employed in previous experiments using lasers. To satisfy these requirements, we have newly designed a small pulsed-magnet with a racetrack shape that has a field length of 20 cm. In general, pulsed magnets are used for the study of material properties and suited to produce higher fields than that of superconducting magnets [65,66]. Our magnet currently produces a peak field of up to 12 T at the magnet center, and we use multiple magnets to increase the total field length. The details of the magnet structure, properties, and operation have been described in Ref. [67]. The magnet features high cooling-efficiency and small heating loss due to a low resistance coil, enabling highly repetitive operation with 0.2 Hz, whereas that of a conventional pulsed magnet is typically \u223c 1 mHz [65]. The time window associated with the pulse significantly reduces background counts at a detector, yielding a clean measurement for LSW searches. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the setup at the BL19LXU beamline in SPring-8 [68]. The undulator has a length of 25 m and provides high intensity x rays. The beams from the undulator are horizontally polarized and have the same time structure of electron bunches circulating the storage ring. The bunch interval was 23.6 ns and is much smaller than the pulse duration of the magnetic field. The undulator gap is tuned to produce x rays with an energy of \u03c9 = 9.5 keV. The direct beam from the undualtor enters the optics hutch where fixed beamlinecomponents have been installed to arrange the beam properties. First, the beam is monochromatized with a double crystal monochromator (DCM) to a band width of \u2206\u03c9/\u03c9 = 10 \u22124 , much smaller than the energy reso- lution of the detector. Higher-order radiations are then removed by a pair of total reflection mirrors (TRMs). Streaks from the mirrors are blocked at a four-jaw slit placed after the mirrors. The beam size was measured to be 1.0 mm (H)\u00d70.5 mm (V) by scanning the slit. The beam from the optics hutch enters the first experimental hutch where the magnet system is placed. It consists of four racetrack magnets and their power supply with two identical discharge sections (DS1 and DS2). The field length of a magnet is given by the straight section of the racetrack coil (shown with dashed lines in Fig. 1(b)), that has a length of 200 mm along the beam axis. The magnets produce parallel fields with respect to the polarization of x rays. The beam pipe passing through the magnet has a diameter of 1/4 inch, much larger than the beam size. To reduce the coil resistance, the magnets are placed in insulating containers and are cooled with liquid nitrogen. As a circuit component, each magnet is regarded as a series of inductance (\u223c 40 \u00b5H) and resistance (\u223c 25 m\u2126). Two magnets are connected in series and are supplied pulsed current from a charged capacitor of 1.5 mF (Nichicon, CCFI-652450HGW\u00d76) by applying an LC-discharge circuit. Figure 2(a) shows a typical field shape. The shot consists of two successive pulses with each duration of about 1 ms. The first pulse is triggered by a forward thyristor (DTI, T77P3000S12100\u00d74) while the second one by a reversed thyristor. The same trigger pulse is divided by a pulse transformer (Nihon Pulse Industry, EX-B865) and is distributed to the thyristors to synchronize the upstream and downstream currents (I 1 and I 2 ). The sum of the two currents (I sum = I 1 + I 2 ) is read out with a current transformer (Pearson Electronics, Model 14239) and the waveform is recorded for each shot by a digitizer (NI PCI-6255). After the second pulse, the energy lost by Joule heating in the magnets is additionally charged to the capacitors.",

Another photodiode (XPD2) is embedded in a lead block with an opening and placed at the central space between the two pairs of the magnets. It serves as a beam dump while it also precisely monitors the flux to check for the photon loss due to misalignment. XPD2 is placed on a slide rail and is retracted to off-axis position during the measurement with XPD1. The pipe center of each magnet is first aligned using a 650-nm reference laser (RL), whose axis coincides with the x-ray beam, and its power meter (LPM) placed downstream of the magnets. RL and LPM are then retracted to off-axis positions, and the x-ray flux is confirmed in front of the detector with XPD1. The detector is also aligned with the same procedure. After the alignment, the pipe ends of Magnet1 (Magnet3) and Magnet2 (Magnet4) are connected with a vacuum joint. The beam path between W4 (W6) and W5 (W7) is evacuated with a scroll pump to a pressure less than 10 Pa. Most of the other beam paths are also under vacuum to avoid x-ray attenuation in air.",

The largest uncertainty comes from the accuracy of the magnet alignment. When the beam deviates from the pipe center, it may feel a weaker field than that at the center. This contribution is evaluated with the worst path and calculated with a finite element simulation (ANSYS [70]) that includes all the 3D-geometrical information of the magnet. It is conservatively estimated so that the beam paths of all magnets are assumed to be the worst one.

The relevant mass region scales to the square root of the photon energy. Thus, it is higher by about two orders of magnitude compared to those probed by laser experiments (Fig. 4, inset). We are currently improving the magnet system to obtain a further gain on the sensitivity. First, as demonstrated here, the total field length of our multi-magnet configuration can be flexibly changed. This approach is thus suited to scale up the system by fabrication of many magnets [71]. Another improvement can be envisaged by increasing the field strength that is currently restricted by the mechanical strength of a coil wound with a Cu wire. Changing the wire material would provide a better mechanical strength. For example, a peak field of 85.8 T has been obtained by a single solenoid wound with a Cu-Ag wire [72][73][74]. Besides, the system provides an efficient way to study nonlinear vacuum effects with large statistics [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. While recent observation of neutron stars suggests the evidence for VMB [75], terrestrial measurements require a small gain on the current sensitivity [8]. Since the signal birefringence increases in proportion to the square of the field strength, high fields from pulsed magnets are advantageous [9,67]. In addition, the time variation of the field is essential to distinguish the signal from a large static birefringence of cavity mirrors [76,77]. The novel system also provides various applications for studies on material properties under high-field conditions [78]. Speaking only to SR facilities, many efforts have been made to technically combine a conventional pulsed magnet with the x-ray beam [79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. Thus, transportability of the system would further increase the experimental opportunities.",

The system provides a new method of probing vacuum under a high magnetic field with large statistics and various applications for studies on material properties. The transportability of the system makes its field widely available to other experiments and facilities.",
