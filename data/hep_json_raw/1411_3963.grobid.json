An example of such a theory is the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) [17,18]. In this model, three massive right-handed neutrinos are introduced to explain simultaneously neutrino oscillations, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe.",

This strategy has been used in a number of experiments for the search of neutral leptons (heavy neutrinos) in the past [20][21][22][23][24], where the spectra of electrons and muons originating in decays of pions and kaons have been studied. The second strategy is to look for the decays of heavy neutrinos to hadrons and leptons [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. The bounds on mixing matrix element |U \u00b5H | 2 are shown in Figure 1  [33]. The best constraints in the small mass region m \u03bdH < 450 MeV/c 2 were from the CERN PS191 [25] experiment, giving roughly |U \u00b5H | 2 < 10 \u22129 in the region 250< m \u03bdH < 450 MeV/c 2 . In the CERN PS191 analysis, the heavy neutrino production and decay rates were calculated for usual Dirac neutrinos with the sole assumption of a Dirac mass matrix. Production rates for the channels presented in Figure 1 are not modified if the mass eigenstates are of the Majorana type. Decay rates for non-self charge conjugate channels are multiplied by a factor of two for Majorana neutrinos. The limits given here should therefore be divided by the square root of two if one considers massive Majorana neutrinos.",

The existence of heavy neutrinos should not spoil the BBN predictions, so the heavy neutrino lifetime, \u03c4 \u03bdH , should be less than 0.1 s. The BBN bound shown in Figure 1 was calculated in the \u03bdMSM framework assuming that the coupling of \u03bd H to the third generation of leptons is stronger than to the others. In case of maximum coupling of \u03bd H to the first (second) generation of leptons the BBN bound will be weaker (stronger) as shown in [34].",

Since the E949 experiment focused on measuring the branching ratio of the rare kaon decay K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd, the principal trigger selection criteria were designed to identify pions and reject muons. In the present analysis, however, decay product muons must be identified; these muons are present in the data set due to inefficiencies in the pion selection criteria applied. In this analysis we used E949 data taken from March to June in 2002. The total exposure for this analysis is 1.70 \u00d7 10 12 stopped kaons [37]. The analysis is sensitive to the heavy neutrino mass region between 175 and 300 MeV/c 2 that corresponds to muon momentum 200 to 130 MeV/c.",

Downstream of the BWPCs, cylindrical degraders slowed the kaons so that they came to rest in the center of the target. The inactive degrader was made of 11.1 cm long BeO and 4.76 mm Lucite. The active degrader (AD) consisted of 40 layers of 2 mm thick scintillator disks (139 mm diameter) alternating with 2.2 mm thick copper disks (136 mm diameter). The AD was split into 12 azimuthal segments. The scintillation light in each segment was sent to a single photomultiplier tube (PMT) through wavelength shifting fibers and read out by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Using this information the AD allowed identification of the beam particles and detection of activity coincident with kaon decays.

            "text": "The total acceptance after applied cuts is shown in Figure 5. The acceptance drop off below 140 MeV/c is due to the requirement that charged track must reach at least the sixth layer of the range stack. The acceptance drop off above 200 MeV/c is due to two requirements. First, the charged track must not reach layer 19 of the range stack and second, the refined range removes long tracks which are dominant at high momentum for events passing the layer 19 requirement. The main acceptance loss (factor \u223c 20) comes from the online pion identifi- cation requirement (blue curve in Figure 5). It should be noted that the acceptance curves in Figure 5 must be corrected for momentum p > 220 MeV/c since the Monte Carlo simulation of layer 19 and the refined range requirements are not accurate in this region. However, this is not relevant for the heavy neutrino study since we will investigate the momentum region between 130 MeV/c and 200 MeV/c. According to Figure 5 the acceptance is smooth and has a maximum in this region. The total acceptance for the K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd H decay with heavy neutrino mass m \u03bdH = 250 MeV/c 2 (P \u00b5 = 163.6 MeV/c) was measured to be",

Heavy neutrinos with masses O(1) GeV/c 2 are allowed by the \u03bdMSM model. The main E949 trigger was designed to select pions, but muons were present in data set due to inefficiencies in the pion selection criteria applied. These muons were used for the search for heavy neutrinos. Since no evidence for extra peaks below the main K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 peak was found we set new upper bounds on the mixing matrix element |U \u00b5H | 2 in the mass region 175-300 MeV/c 2 .

The SPI table includes both online and offline photon veto requirements and we cannot use it if the muon and the photon hit the same stopping hextant because the range stack photon veto was not applied in this case. A photon was rejected if it hits any of the photon veto detectors with a detected energy more than 1 MeV (offline PV threshold). The true threshold for the photon energy should be lower than this because of the contamination due to detector activity or electronic noise. The photon acceptance was measured to be A P V = (1.24 \u00b1 0.38) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , where the estimated uncertainty is determined by scanning the energy threshold in the MC from 0 to 1 MeV. The solid smooth black line shows the result of a previous peak search in kaon decays [22], The dot-dash magenta lines show the results of the heavy neutrino decay experiment CERN PS191 [25] in two modes: the upper dot-dash line is derived from K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bdH \u2192 \u00b5 + (\u00b5 \u2212 e + \u03bde) + c.c., the lower dot-dash line is derived from K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bdH \u2192 \u00b5 + (\u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + ) + c.c. The blue shaded region shows one of the possible BBN lower bounds [34,35]. Colors are available online.",
