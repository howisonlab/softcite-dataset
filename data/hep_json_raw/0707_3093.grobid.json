Measurements are presented for inclusive forward jets as well as for forward jets accompanied by a dijet system. The explored phase space, with jet pseudorapidity up to 4.3 is expected to be particularly sensitive to the dynamics of QCD parton evolution at low x. The measurements are compared to fixed-order QCD calculations and to leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo models.",

HERA has extended the phase-space region in the Bjorken scaling variable, x Bj , down to a few 10 \u22125 . At such low x Bj , several steps in the QCD cascade initiated by a parton from the proton can occur before the final interaction with the virtual photon takes place. The result of this cascade may be observed in the final state and provides an opportunity to study the QCD parton evolution in detail.",

The measurements were compared to the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD calculations, which were found to be below the data, in certain regions by as much as a factor of two. The large contribution of next-to-leading-order corrections and the size of the theoretical uncertainty indicate that in this phase space higher-order contributions are important. The best overall description of the inclusive forward-jet cross sections was obtained by the newly tuned Ariadne MC model. The Cascade MC with J2003 set-1 and J2003 set-2 for unintegrated gluon density failed to satisfactorily describe the data.
