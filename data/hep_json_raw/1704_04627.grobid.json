In a simplified way it can be thought of as a two-stage process: in a first step charm-anticharm quark pairs are produced in elementary parton-parton interactions. This high energy scale process is well understood in the context of perturbative Quantum ChromoDynamics (pQCD). The subsequent binding into charmonium states happens at lower energy scales and is thus a non-perturbative process.

Blue squares refer to J/\u03c8 at forward rapidity, red circles to J/\u03c8 at midrapidity. Left: ALICE measurement (top), compared to prediction by PYTHIA6 (bottom)[12]. Right: Prediction by percolation model[13]. The dotted line refers to J/\u03c8 at forward rapidity, the dashed line to J/\u03c8 at mid-rapidity, while the solid line shows the linear behavior.",
