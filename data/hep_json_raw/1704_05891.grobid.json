Lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-lead (pPb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 39 and 63 TeV respectively with L int = 33 nb \u22121 and 8 pb \u22121 monthly integrated luminosities, will provide unprecedented experimental conditions to study quark-gluon matter at temperatures O(1 GeV). The following topics are succinctly discussed: (i) charm-quark densities thrice larger than at the LHC, leading to direct heavy-quark impact in the bulk QGP properties, (ii) quarkonia, including \u03a5(1S ), melting at temperatures up to five times above the QCD critical temperature, (iii) access to initial-state nuclear parton distributions (nPDF) at fractional momenta as low as x \u2248 10 \u22127 , (iv) availability of about 5 \u2022 10 5 top-quark pairs per run to study the high-x gluon nPDF and the energy loss properties of boosted colour-antennas, (v) study of possible Higgs boson suppression in the QGP, and (vi) high-luminosity \u03b3 \u03b3 (ultraperipheral) collisions at c.m. energies up to 1 TeV.",

Such large charm densities will have two main consequences. First, since finite-T QCD calculations [11] indicate that charm quarks start contributing as thermal degrees-of-freedom in the QGP equation of state for T\u2248 350 MeV, they will modify the bulk thermodynamic properties of the medium compared to lower-energy collisions, as well as actively participate in the collectively flowing medium. Secondly, thermal cc quarks can recombine into J/\u03c8 bound states with larger probability than at the LHC [12], leading to a change in the J/\u03c8 production pattern from the suppression observed so far to an enhanced production at low p T compared to pp collisions at the same energy [10]. In the bottom-quark sector, the initial QGP temperatures O(1 GeV) can lead to direct melting of the \u03a5(1S) bound-state, expected by lattice-QCD calculations to occur at T = (4-5)T c [13], although the large density of bb pairs may partially compensate for such a suppression through recombination in the plasma [12].",

The corresponding yields per month, after typical analysis cuts, amount to few 10 5 tt pairs in the \"cleanest\" fully leptonic decay channel, tt \u2192 bb 2 2\u03bd [15] (or about \u00d74 more in the lepton+jets modes). Top quarks provide valuable information of both the initial and final states in nuclear collisions. Since top pairs are dominantly produced in gg fusion processes, the rapidity distribution of their decay leptons in pPb compared to pp collisions traces accurately the nuclear modification of the gluon nPDF at high scales Q = m top over a wide x range [14]. The impact that the FCC tt data would have in a nPDF EPS09 global fit [4] is shown via the R Pb g (x, Q 2 ) = g Pb (x, Q 2 )/g p (x, Q 2 ) ratio in Fig. 2 (left). The uncertainties on the nuclear glue are reduced by about a factor of two (grey band compared to red dashes), mostly in the so-far unexplored antishadowing and EMC x regions [14,3]. The top quark can also be used as sensitive probe of in-medium parton energy loss by studying boosted topologies with increasingly longer (Lorentz-dilated) decays into final-state quarks t \u2192 W(qq )b. Due to the Lorentz boost, the system travels through the medium as a colour-singlet antenna for some fraction of the time. By comparing the reconstructed top mass as a function of its p T (Fig. 2, right), it should be thus possible to get a unique insight into the space-time evolution of jet-quenching in the hot QCD medium [16].",

In the clean diphoton \"discovery\" channel, after branching ratio (BR = 0.23%), acceptance and efficiency losses, one expects about 500 and 1 000 Higgs events per month in PbPb and pPb, on top of the corresponding \u03b3 \u03b3 non-resonant background. Figure 3 (left) shows the expected invariant mass distribution in PbPb at 39 TeV. The expected significance of the diphoton signal (S) over the background (B), computed via S/ \u221a B at the Higgs peak, is 5.5\u03c3. Interestingly, once produced, the Higgs boson, with a lifetime of \u03c4 0 \u2248 50 fm/c, traverses the final-state medium and can scatter with the surrounding partons, resulting in a potential depletion of its yields compared to the pp case [17]. Since the Higgs boson production cross section in absence of final-state effects is theoretically very well known [18], the amount of potential Higgs boson suppression can thus be used to accurately determine the density of the produced QGP.",

The large c.m. energies will open up studies of nuclear parton distributions in the unexplored saturation (down to x \u2248 10 \u22127 ) and large-x (antishadowing and EMC domains, with top-quarks) regimes. The heaviest SM elementary particles (top quark and Higgs boson) will be copiously produced, offering novel high-precision handles to study the properties of hot and dense QCD matter.
