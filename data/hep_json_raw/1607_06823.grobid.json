            "text": "The B + c meson, the lightestbc bound state, can only decay weakly. Since it contains only heavy quarks, its decays can be analysed using various theoretical approaches, including QCD-based methods [1][2][3] and QCD-inspired phenomenological models [4,5]. A measurement of the weak decay properties of B + c mesons can test these approaches and provide insight into the dynamics of the heavy quarks in the B + c meson. The exclusive decay 1 B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + is of particular interest since it proceeds via a b \u2192 cus transition and thus is CKM-suppressed by a factor |V us /V ud | 2 \u223c 0.05 with respect to B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + , where the dominant amplitude is a b \u2192 cud transition. In addition to the CKM matrix elements, the ratio of branching fractions R K/\u03c0 \u2261 B(B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + )/B(B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + ) depends on the form factors of the two decays. Theoretical calculations of R K/\u03c0 have been carried out using approaches that handle the non-factorisable and non-perturbative contributions in different ways, yielding values in the range from 0.05 to 0.10 [1,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15].",

The uncertainty on this value is too large to discriminate between the predictions quoted above. The pp data sample used in ref. [16], taken at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb \u22121 , is now reanalysed in this paper together with an additional sample taken at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 . Owing to improvements in the analysis method as well as the increase in the data sample size, the statistical uncertainty is reduced by a factor of more than two. The systematic uncertainty is also reduced. 1 The inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout the paper.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of charged particle momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T (in GeV/c) is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam direction. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

Hadron (h + ) candidates are selected from well-reconstructed tracks with p T > 500 MeV/c, inconsistent with originating from any PV and with the muon hypothesis. Candidate B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + decays are formed from J/\u03c8 h + combinations that originate from a common vertex. They must also be within 500 MeV/c 2 of the known B + c mass [19]. The impact parameter \u03c7 2 , \u03c7 2 IP , which is defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the PV with and without the particle under consideration, is required to be less than 16 for the B + c candidates. A multivariate classifier using a boosted decision tree (BDT) [29] is constructed to further suppress the combinatorial background. The kinematic variables used as inputs to the BDT are chosen to discriminate between signal and background. The twelve variables chosen are: the \u03c7 2 IP of the B + c , J/\u03c8 , \u00b5 + , \u00b5 \u2212 and h + candidates; the p T of the J/\u03c8 , \u00b5 + , \u00b5 \u2212 and h + candidates; the \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of the B + c vertex fit; and the decay time and the decay length of the B + c candidate. Since the kaon-pion mass difference is small compared with the energy release of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 h + decays, the distributions of the BDT variables are similar for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + decays. The BDT is trained with simulated B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + decays to represent both the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + signals, and with events from the upper mass sideband of the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + candidates in data, [6444, 6528] MeV/c 2 , to represent the combinatorial background. For one third of the events in the training samples the centre-of-mass energy is 7 TeV, and for the rest it is 8 TeV in accordance with the ratio of integrated luminosities. Since the BDT does not use any particle identification information, it selects both B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + candidates. Particle identification requirements using information from the RICH subdetectors are then applied to the hadrons to obtain two mutually exclusive samples of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + candidates. The BDT and particle identification requirements are optimised sequentially on the sample of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + candidates that pass the loose preselection to maximise N K / \u221a N tot , where N tot is the total number of candidates within \u00b13 times the mass resolution around the known B + c mass. Here N K refers to the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + signal yield and is estimated to be (N tot \u2212 N comb )/(1 + 1/(r eff R K/\u03c0 )), where the value of R K/\u03c0 is taken from the previous LHCb measurement [16], N comb is the number of combinatorial background events in the signal region extrapolated from the upper sideband, and r eff represents the ratio of the numbers of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + events that pass the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + selection and fall in the signal window. After this optimisation, the BDT rejects more than 99.8% of the combinatorial background and keeps around 70% of B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 h + events. This particle identification requirement has an efficiency of about 70% for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and 87% for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + , while the probabilities for a charged kaon to be misidentified as a pion and a charged pion to be misidentified as a kaon are below 7% and 1%, respectively.",
