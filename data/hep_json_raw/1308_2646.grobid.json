An angular analysis suggests that these states have I G (J P ) = 1 + (1 + ) quantum numbers [3]. Analysis of the quark composition of the initial and final states allows us to assert that these hadronic objects are the first examples of states of an exotic nature with a bb quark pair: Z b should be comprised of (at least) four quarks. Several models have been pro-posed to describe the internal structure of these states [4][5][6]. The proximity of the Z \u00b1 b (10610) and Z \u00b1 b (10650) masses to thresholds for the open beauty channels B * B and B * B * suggests a \"molecular\" structure for these states, which is consistent with many of their observed properties [7]. More recently, Belle reported the observation of both Z \u00b1 b (10610) and Z \u00b1 b (10650) in an analysis of the three-body \u03a5(10860) \u2192 [B ( * ) B * ] \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decay [8]. The dominant Z b decay mode is found to be B ( * ) B * , supporting the molecular hypothesis. It would be natural to expect the existence of neutral partners of these states. This motivates us to search for Z 0 b in the resonant substructure of \u03a5(10860) \u2192 \u03a5(nS)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays.",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector, a central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters, and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field.

S(s 1 , s 2 ) is |M(s 1 , s 2 )| 2 convoluted with the detector resolution (6.0 MeV/c 2 for M (\u03a5(nS)\u03c0 0 )); \u01eb(s 1 , s 2 ) describes the variation of the reconstruction efficiency over the Dalitz plot. The fraction f sig is the fraction of signal events in the data sample determined separately for each \u03a5(nS) decay mode (see Table I) To ensure that the fit converges to the global minimum, we perform 10 3 fits with randomly assigned initial values for amplitudes and phases. We find two solutions for the \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 sample with similar values of \u22122 ln L (see Table III). Solution A has better consistency with the Dalitz plot fit result for the \u03a5(10860) \u2192 \u03a5(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay [8]. We find single solutions for the \u03a5(1, 3S)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 samples. Table IV shows the values and errors of amplitudes and phases obtained from the fit to the \u03a5(1S)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03a5(3S)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 Dalitz plots. Projections of the fits are shown in Figs. 3-5. These projections are very similar to the corresponding distributions in \u03a5(nS)\u03c0",

No constraints between samples are imposed on signal model parameters and the background description. The combined significance of the Z 0 b (10610) signal is 6.8\u03c3. Results for the simultaneous fit are exactly the same as in separate fits of \u03a5(2, 3S)\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 samples, as expected. We also perform a simultaneous fit with the Z 0 b (10610) mass as a free parameter and find m(Z 0 b (10610)) = (10609\u00b14\u00b14) MeV/c 2 ; this is consistent with the mass of the Z \u00b1 b (10610). Table VII shows the main sources of systematic uncertainties for the measurement of fractions obtained from a fit of individual channels. The model uncertainty originates mainly from the parameterization of the nonresonant amplitude. Four additional models are used: with an additional f 0 (500) resonance, parameterized by a Breit-Wigner function with M = 600 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 400 MeV/c; a model with a nr = ae i\u03c6a + be i\u03c6 b s(\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ); a model without the f 0 (980) contribution; and a model without the a nr 2 contribution. Another source of systematic uncertainty is the determination of the signal efficiency. To estimate this effect, we perform two additional fits with a modified efficiency function by varying the momentum dependence of the \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency. We also perform a fit with a modified detector resolution function: the resolutions are varied from 4 to 8 MeV/c 2 instead of the nominal 6 MeV/c 2 to take into account the effect of different momentum resolu-  tions in MC and data. We use different sideband subsamples to determine the background PDF parameters: the low-mass sideband only, or the high-mass sideband, or \u03a5(nS) \u2192 e + e \u2212 events only, or \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events only. We also vary the signal to background ratio within its errors. We considered the effect of the uncertainty of the c.m. energy (conservatively taken as \u00b13 MeV).",

The corresponding limit for the model uncertainties is 4.5. We combine these two values in quadrature and decrease \u2206(\u22122 ln L) from the simultaneous fit by 6.3 in calculations of the Z 0 b (10610) significance.
