Measurements are reported as a function of q 2 , the square of the dimuon invariant mass and results of the angular analysis are found to be consistent with the Standard Model. In the range 1 < q 2 < 6 GeV 2 /c 4 , where precise theoretical calculations are available, the differential branching fraction is found to be more than 3 \u03c3 below the Standard Model predictions.",

In the Standard Model (SM) it is forbidden at tree-level and proceeds via loop diagrams as shown in figure 1. In extensions of the SM, new heavy particles can appear in competing diagrams and affect both the branching fraction of the decay and the angular distributions of the final-state particles. This decay channel was first observed and studied by the CDF collaboration [1,2] and subsequently studied by the LHCb collaboration using data collected during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 [3]. While the angular distributions were found to be in good agreement with SM expectations, the measured branching fraction differs from the recently updated SM prediction by 3.1 \u03c3 [4,5]. A similar trend is also seen for the branching fractions of other b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 processes, which tend to be lower than SM predictions [6][7][8].",

The differential branching fraction dB(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )/dq 2 is determined as a function of q 2 , the square of the dimuon invariant mass. In addition, a three-dimensional angular analysis in cos \u03b8 l , cos \u03b8 K and \u03a6 is performed in bins of q 2 . Here, the angle \u03b8 K (\u03b8 l ) denotes the angle of the K \u2212 (\u00b5 \u2212 ) with respect to the direction of flight of the B 0 s meson in the K + K \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) centre-of-mass frame, and \u03a6 denotes the angle between the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and the K + K \u2212 decay planes in the B 0 s meson centre-of-mass frame. Compared to the previously published fit of the one-dimensional projections of the decay angles [3], the full three-dimensional angular fit gives improved sensitivity and allows access to more angular observables.",

Although B 0 s meson production is suppressed with respect to the B 0 meson by the fragmentation fraction ratio f s /f d \u223c 1/4, the narrow \u03c6 resonance allows a clean selection with low background levels. Furthermore, the contribution from the S wave, where the K + K \u2212 system is in a spin-0 configuration, is expected to be low [11]. Since the K + K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state is not flavour-specific, the angular observables accessible in the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are the CP averages F L , S 3,4,7 and the CP asymmetries A 5,6,8,9 [12].

To determine the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal yields in bins of q 2 , extended maximum likelihood fits are performed. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential function, whilst the signal component is modelled with the sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean and a radiative power-law tail toward smaller invariant mass values. The parameters describing the signal mass shape are determined from a fit to the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 control mode. The q 2 dependence of the signal mass resolution is accounted for by using scale factors, which are determined from simulation. The K + K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 invariant mass distributions for the signal decay in bins of q 2 are given in appendix A; the yields and corresponding uncertainties are listed in table 1. Integrating over the q 2 bins, the signal yield is found to be 432 \u00b1 24. A fit to the control mode B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6, which is used for normalisation, gives N J/\u03c8 \u03c6 = 62 033 \u00b1 260 decays.",

A weighted average is calculated by combining this updated measurement with the measurements by Belle [30] and CDF [31]. The resulting relative and absolute differential branching fractions are given in table 1. The differential branching fraction is also shown in figure 4, overlaid with SM predictions from refs.

For the SM predictions, the form factors are determined in a combined fit to the results of light-cone sum rule calculations at low q 2 [5] and lattice QCD calculations at high q 2 [33,34]. Standard Model predictions for the branching fraction at high q 2 that exclusively use the results from lattice calculations [35] are found to be larger than the results from the combined fit. Owing to their proximity to the charmonium resonances, no predictions are available corresponding to the q 2 bins 5.0 < q 2 < 8.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and 11.0 < q 2 < 12.5 GeV 2 /c 4 .",

To evaluate the size of uncertainties affecting the efficiency ratio, it is recalculated after applying the corresponding systematic variation to the simulated samples. The observed deviation is taken as systematic uncertainty. The procedure to correct the tracking efficiency in simulation introduces a systematic uncertainty on the efficiency ratio of less than 0.6%. The correction to particle identification performance in simulation has a systematic uncertainty of 0.5%. The relative efficiency is further affected by the data-driven corrections to the simulation in the distribution of the variables p T (B 0 s ) and \u03c7 efficiency on the underlying physics model. Its effect on the branching fraction measurement is evaluated by varying the Wilson coefficient C 9 used in the generation of simulated signal events. By allowing a New Physics contribution of \u22121.5, which is motivated by the global fit results in ref. [38], the resulting systematic uncertainty is found to be less than 1.6%. The selection requirements introduce a decay-time dependence of the efficiencies which can, due to the sizeable lifetime difference in the B 0 s system [39], affect the measured branching fraction [40]. The systematic uncertainty is determined with simulated B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal events, generated using time-dependent decay amplitudes as described in ref. [12]. When varying the Wilson coefficients, the size of the effect is found to be at most 1.6%, which is taken as the systematic uncertainty.

The maximum order of the polynomials that is included is four for cos \u03b8 l , two for cos \u03b8 K , six for the angle \u03a6 and five for q 2 . In addition, the acceptance is assumed to be symmetric in the decay angles. This choice corresponds to the lowest orders of polynomials that describe the acceptance effect. The acceptance description is cross-checked using the control mode B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6. An angular analysis of the control mode is performed and the angular observables are found to be in good agreement with the previous measurement [39].  Appendix B gives the one-dimensional angular distributions of the signal decay in each q 2 bin, overlaid with the projections of the likelihood fit. For the q 2 bins with the lowest number of signal candidates, pseudoexperiments show the likelihood estimator to be biased for certain observables due to boundary effects which arise from the requirement of eq. (1.1) being positive for all values of the decay angles. Therefore, the Feldman-Cousins method [41] is used to determine confidence regions for each observable, which guarantees correct coverage for low signal yields. The remaining signal observables are treated as nuisance parameters following the plugin method [42]. The Feldman-Cousins scans for the angular observables in bins of q 2 are given in appendix C. In some q 2 bins, the shape of the obtained confidence level is dominated by effects arising from the boundary condition. Table 3 gives the minima of the Feldman-Cousins scans and the 68% confidence intervals. The linear correlations between the angular observables in the different q 2 bins are given in appendix D. The angular observables are shown in figure 5, overlaid with SM predictions from refs. [4,5]. No predictions are given for S 7 and A 5,6,8,9 ; they are expected to be close to zero in the SM.  ",

For the total branching fraction, a further uncertainty originates from the uncertainty on the branching fraction of the normalisation mode. The measured branching fraction is compatible with the previous measurement [3] and lies below SM expectations. For the q 2 region 1.0 < q 2 < 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 the differential branching fraction of (2.58 +0.33 \u22120.31 \u00b10.08\u00b10.19)\u00d710 \u22128 GeV \u22122 c 4 is more than 3 \u03c3 below the SM prediction of (4.81 \u00b1 0.56) \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV \u22122 c 4 [4,5,32].
