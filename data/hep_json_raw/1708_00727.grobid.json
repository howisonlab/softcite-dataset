The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 , recorded in 2015 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events with exactly one electron or muon and at least two jets in the final state are used for the measurement. Two separate selections are applied that each focus on different top-quark momentum regions, referred to as resolved and boosted topologies of the tt final state. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and are compared to several Monte Carlo simulations by means of calculated \u03c7 2 and p-values.",

In addition, both experiments published measurements of the top-quark transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum which focused on the highest momentum region using the \u221a s = 8 TeV data set [10,11]. The results presented in this paper probe the top-quark kinematic properties at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV and complement recent measurements involving leptonic final states (ATLAS [12], CMS [13]). At this energy, the prediction for the inclusive cross-section is increased by a factor of 3.3 compared to 8 TeV, and the top quarks are produced at higher transverse momenta. This allows the top-quark p T reach to be extended up to 1.5 TeV in order to explore both the low-and the high-momentum top-quark kinematic regimes.",

Where the jet selection efficiency of the resolved analysis decreases with the increasing top-quark transverse momentum, the boosted selection takes over to efficiently select events at higher momenta of the hadronically decaying top quarks. This paper presents a set of measurements of the tt production cross-section as a function of different properties of the reconstructed top quark (transverse momentum and rapidity) and of the tt system (transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass). The results, unfolded to a fiducial particle-level phase-space, are presented as both absolute and relative differential cross-sections and are compared to the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The goal of unfolding to a fiducial particle-level phase-space and of using variables directly related to detector observables is to allow precision tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), avoiding uncertainties due to model-dependent extrapolations both to parton-level objects and to phase-space regions outside the detector sensitivity.",

This analysis exploits all major components of the detector. Chargedparticle trajectories with pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.5 are reconstructed in the inner detector, which comprises a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer [15], was added before the start of the 13 TeV LHC operation, at a radius of 33 mm around a new, thinner beam pipe. The inner detector is embedded in a 2 T axial magnetic field, allowing precise measurement of charged-particle momenta. Sampling calorimeters with several different designs span the pseudorapidity range up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. High-granularity liquid argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters are used up to |\u03b7| = 3.2. Hadronic calorimeters based on scintillator-tile active material cover |\u03b7| < 1.7 while LAr technology is used for hadronic calorimetry in the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9. The calorimeters are surrounded by a muon spectrometer within a magnetic field provided by air-core toroid magnets with a bending integral of about 2.5 Tm in the barrel and up to 6 Tm in the end-caps. Three layers of precision drift tubes and cathode-strip chambers provide an accurate measurement of the muon track curvature in the region |\u03b7| < 2.7. Resistive-plate and thin-gap chambers provide muon triggering capability up to |\u03b7| = 2.4.",

Consequently, the boosted topology is included in this paper where jets with large radius are used, resulting in an improved efficiency at high p T , as shown in figure 9c. The progressive decrease in efficiency seen in figure 9c is caused by the lepton isolation requirements becoming too stringent as the top-quark momentum increases, as well as a decrease in efficiency of the b-tagging requirements at very high jet momentum [68].

The uncertainties in the large-R JES, the jet mass scale (JMS) and the \u03c4 32 subjettiness ratio are obtained using a data-driven method, which compares the ratio of each large-R jet kinematic variable reconstructed from clusters in the calorimeter to that from innerdetector tracks between data and MC simulation [63].

The uncertainty in \u03c4 32 is considered uncorrelated with those in JES and JMS and consists of two components [71] where an uncertainty obtained by applying the above procedure to \u221a s = 8 TeV data is followed by applying an uncertainty in a cross-calibration contribution derived by simulating the different data-taking conditions for 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC pp",

In addition, in the resolved-topology, an extra 50% uncertainty is assigned to this background to account for the remaining mismodelling observed in various control regions. This systematic uncertainty, in the resolved topology, also includes the impact of this normalisation on extracting the W +jets estimate. In the case of the boosted topology, the mismodelling of this background is present only at large values of m W T . Consequently, for events satisfying m W T > 150 GeV, an extra 100% uncertainty is included in the fake-leptons background estimate. Finally, in order to take into account the effect on the W +jets sample due to a different non-prompt and fake leptons background normalization also in the boosted-topology, an extra systematic is added which reflects the difference in the W +jet estimate obtained by varying the non-prompt and fake leptons background normalization by 30%.
