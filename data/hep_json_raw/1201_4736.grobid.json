The LHCb experiment at the CERN LHC aims to perform precision heavy flavour and CP violation measurements, including improving the knowledge of \u03b3. Focus will be put on methods using B meson decays at the tree level, within the Standard Model framework. The early data recorded by the experiment, from pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, allowed observations of the first signals of the B decay modes that will be used to perform this measurement.",

Efforts are being made at the LHCb experiement to constrain its measurement using several channels, that will give a combined sensitivity considerably better than the current one. The status of these studies using data collected by the experiment at \u221a s = 7 TeV up to 2011 has been presented.",
