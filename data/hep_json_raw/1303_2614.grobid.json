            "text": "The combined symmetry of charge conjugation and parity (CP) is broken in the weak interaction of the Standard Model by a single phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix [1,2]. Physics beyond the Standard Model may reveal itself in the form of additional sources of CP violation. In both the K 0 and B 0 systems CP violation has been unambiguously observed, and is in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. In contrast, CP violation in the charm sector has yet to be established. The amount of CP violation in charm decays was generally expected to be much smaller than the 1% level in the Standard Model [3,4]. The LHCb collaboration, however, reported evidence with 3.5 standard deviations significance for direct CP violation in two-body, singly-Cabibbosuppressed D 0 decays [5]. The difference in CP asymmetries between D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays was found to be A CP = (\u22120.82 \u00b1 0.21 (stat) \u00b1 0.11 (syst))%. This result sparked a theoretical debate on whether or not this could be accommodated within the Standard Model. For a comprehensive review see Ref. [6].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The polarity of the magnet is reversed repeatedly during data taking, which causes all detection asymmetries that are induced by the leftright separation of charged particles to change sign. The combined tracking system has momentum resolution p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [12]. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger [13] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 6.4 [14] with a specific LHCb configuration [15]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [16] in which final state radiation is generated using Photos [17]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector and its response are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [18] as described in Ref. [19]. The B + and B 0 mesons in the simulated events are forced to decay semileptonically using a cocktail of decay modes, including those that involve excited D states and \u03c4 leptons, that lead to final states with a D 0 meson and a muon.",

The measurement of A CP is performed separately for the two field polarities. The final value for A CP is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the two results to reduce as much as possible any residual effect of the detection asymmetry. To minimise potential trigger biases the candidates are required to be accepted by specific trigger decisions. About 87% of the candidates in the final selection are triggered at the hardware stage by the muon system only, about 3% by the hadronic calorimeter only and about 10% by both. The muon trigger requires the muon transverse momentum, p T , to be greater than 1.48 GeV/c. The effect of a charge-dependent shift in the p T estimate in this trigger is corrected, which requires tightening the muon transverse momentum cut, as measured by the hardware trigger, to p T > 1.64 GeV/c. In the software trigger the candidates are selected by either a single muon trigger or by a topological trigger, which selects combinations of a muon with one or two additional tracks that are consistent with the topological signature of b-hadron decays.

Further assuming a B + production asymmetry of 1.0% [25] and assuming no B 0 production asymmetry, the difference in the effective production asymmetry between the two modes is \u223c 0.02%.",

The stability of the raw asymmetries and A CP is also investigated as a function of all possible reconstructed quantities, for instance the D 0 decay time, the b-hadron flight distance, the reconstructed D 0 -muon mass, the angle between the muon and D 0 daughters, and the (transverse) momenta and pseudorapidity of the muon and D 0 meson.
