Single ratios, at a given \u221a s for the two processes and at different \u221a s for each process, as well as double ratios of the two processes at different \u221a s, are evaluated. The ratios are constructed using previously published ATLAS measurements of the tt and Z-boson production cross sections, corrected to a common phase space where required, and a new analysis of Z \u2192 + \u2212 where = e, \u00b5 at \u221a s = 13 TeV performed with data collected in 2015 with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . Correlations of systematic uncertainties are taken into account when evaluating the uncertainties in the ratios. The correlation model is also used to evaluate the combined cross section of the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and the Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channels for each \u221a s value. The results are compared to calculations performed at next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy using recent sets of parton distribution functions. The data demonstrate significant power to constrain the gluon distribution function for the Bjorken-x values near 0.1 and the lightquark sea for x < 0.02.",

The experimental precision of such measurements has reached the few-percent level in the case of the total tt production cross section, \u03c3 tot tt , and the sub-percent level for the Z-boson production cross section with subsequent Z \u2192 + \u2212 decay within the fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance, \u03c3 fid Z . This experimental precision is complemented by an accurate determination of the proton-proton, pp, collision luminosity, which has reached a precision of approximately 2% [19,20]. These measurements are compared with theoretical predictions performed at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-log (NNLL) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for \u03c3 tot tt [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] and at NNLO QCD plus next-to-leadingorder (NLO) electroweak (EW) accuracy for \u03c3 fid Z [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]. Quantitative comparisons to the predictions can be used to impose constraints on a number of Standard Model parameters such as the parton distribution functions (PDF), the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ) and the top-quark mass (m t ).",

Top-quark-pair and Z-boson production at various \u221a s values sample different Bjorken-x regions, with higher energies sampling smaller average x. This dependence leads to a strong increase of the gluon-fusion-dominated tt production cross section with \u221a s while the increase of the qq-dominated Z-boson production cross section is more moderate. However, the luminosity uncertainties associated with such measurements are dominated by effects uncorrelated between different centre-of-mass energies and data-taking periods, thereby limiting the precision with which cross sections measured at different \u221a s values can be directly compared. The luminosity uncertainties as well as some of the experimental uncertainties can cancel when ratios of cross sections are evaluated. The predictions of the ratios of Zboson production cross sections at different centre-of-mass energies are only moderately affected by PDF uncertainties, opening the possibility to use such measurements to crossnormalise other measurements made at different \u221a s values or in different running periods, as well as providing cross-checks on the corresponding integrated-luminosity ratios and their uncertainties.",

This measurement uses the same methodology as a previous measurement performed at 13 TeV [11] but is specifically designed to be fully synchronised with the corresponding tt selection at the same energy. A detailed evaluation of the correlations of the systematic uncertainties for the different ATLAS results for the two processes and three centre-of-mass energies is performed, resulting in significant cancellations of some of the uncertainties in the ratios. The correlation model is also used to evaluate the combined cross section times branching ratios of the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 and the Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channels for each \u221a s value, and the resulting measurements are reported together with the corresponding correlation matrix. The data are compared to the state-ofthe-art calculations performed at the highest-available order in perturbative theory, using several of the modern PDF sets. A quantitative study of projected PDF uncertainties with the inclusion of these results shows that the ATLAS measurements presented in this paper can have a significant impact in constraining the gluon and light-quark sea distributions.",

The ATLAS detector is described in section 2 and the theoretical predictions for the cross sections and their ratios are summarised in section 3. Section 4 describes the new measurement of the Z-boson production cross section times the branching ratio for Z \u2192 + \u2212 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The cross-section single and double ratios as well as the combined cross sections, including full correlation information, are evaluated and compared to theoretical predictions in section 5, and the ability of these data to further constrain the PDF distributions is discussed. Section 6 summarises the results obtained in the paper. An appendix contains additional predictions that use the total rather than fiducial Z-boson cross sections and also presents all experimental results in tabular form.",

These uncertainties are obtained from the sum in quadrature of the differences between predictions obtained with the central PDF values and those obtained using the variations (eigenvectors) of the respective PDF sets. Where appropriate, asymmetric uncertainties are determined using separate sums of negative and positive variations. The CT14 uncertainties are rescaled from 90% to 68% confidence level (CL). The uncertainties due to the strong coupling constant are estimated following the prescription given with the CT14 PDF, varying \u03b1 S by \u00b10.001 to correspond to 68% CL. The QCD scale uncertainties are defined by the envelope of variations in which the renormalisation (\u00b5 R ) and factorisation (\u00b5 F ) scales are changed by factors of two with an additional constraint of 0.5 \u2264 \u00b5 R /\u00b5 F \u2264 2. The dynamic scale m is used as the central value for the Z-boson predictions. The limitations in the NNLO calculations, referred to as the \"intrinsic\" uncertainties, are estimated by comparing the predictions calculated with the optimised version of DYNNLO 1.5 to the ones obtained with Fewz 3.1. For the total cross-section predictions, these differences are found to be < 0.2% and hence are negligible. For the fiducial cross-section predictions, these differences are larger due to a feature of the calculations involving leptons with symmetric p T requirements, resulting in consistently larger values from Fewz. The differences are calculated using the CT14 PDF to obtain the central value in both cases, and are approximately 0.7% at all three \u221a s values.",

The systematic uncertainties in the predictions are performed as for those of the Z boson, with the following exceptions. Since there is no alternative calculation of the NNLO tt cross section available, no intrinsic uncertainty is assigned to its cross-section prediction. It was verified that the code Hathor v1.5 [48], which implements the exact NNLO tt cross sections, matches the results obtained with Top++v2.0. The tt production cross section also has a significant dependence on the value of the top-quark mass, m t .

In this paper, all ratios involving Z bosons at 7 and 8 TeV are extrapolated to the 13 TeV phase space using the same methodology as reported in section 3.1, i.e. computed using an optimised version of DYNNLO 1.5 and the NNLO parton distribution functions CT14.

These results are taken directly from the publications and from section 4, with one exception: since the publication of the 8 TeV Z-boson fiducial cross section [10], the 8 TeV luminosity values have been finalised [20], resulting in a slight shift of the integrated luminosity value from the published 20.3 fb \u22121 to 20.2 fb \u22121 and significantly reducing the uncertainty from 2.8% to 1.9%.

The three PDF sets used in the PDF4LHC prescription [76], CT14, NNPDF3.0, and MMHT14, predict the largest ratios. The HERA-based HERAPDF2.0 and ATLAS-epWZ12 sets are in the middle. The spread of the predictions is beyond the PDF uncertainties for the three groups of PDFs while the quoted PDF uncertainties are similar in size, with the HERAPDF2.0 errors being the largest and ABM12 the smallest. This pattern could be explained by the differences in the gluon density and the \u03b1 S value used in the PDF sets.

These predictions follow a similar pattern for all ratios: the three predictions from PDF4LHC PDFs are the smallest, closely followed by ATLAS-epWZ12 and HERA-PDF2.0, and the ABM12 prediction is the largest. This pattern could be explained by the PDFs having different gluon distributions as a function of x. At low x, all PDF sets have similar gluon content since the gluon PDF is primarily determined from a common source: scaling violations of the F 2 structure function measured at HERA. At high x, the ABM12 and HERA-based sets have a lower gluon density than other PDF sets. Thus, as the \u221a s increases, resulting in a decrease of the average value of x, the ABM12 and HERA-based sets exhibit a stronger \u221a s dependence than the PDF4LHC PDFs. Given the relative size of the experimental uncertainties and the spread of the theoretical predictions in these ratios, these measurements do not test the consistency of the luminosity calibrations at different centre-of-mass energies to the same precision as the Z-boson cross-section ratios.",

It is preferable to quantify the impact of the ATLAS data by using PDFs that do not include the cross-section data used in this analysis.

Given that the ATLAS-epWZ12 set provides smaller uncertainties for the predicted cross sections compared to HERAPDF2.0, it is chosen for this purpose. The profiling of the ATLAS-epWZ12 PDF set is performed only with the components related to the uncertainties of the HERA [75] and 2010 ATLAS [8] W , Z-boson data, to mimic the inclusion of the new ATLAS data in the PDF fit.

            "text": "B Acceptance factors and results in the Z-boson total phase space The combined Z-boson fiducial cross sections in section 5.4.4 are extrapolated to the full phase space within the dilepton invariant mass range 66 < m < 116 GeV in table 15 by use of acceptance factors A, as described in section 3. The acceptance factors A are expressed as the fraction of decays satisfying the fiducial acceptance at Monte Carlo generator level and are calculated using DYNNLO 1.5 with the CT14 PDF for the central value and for the variations reflecting the PDF set's systematic uncertainty. In addition, uncertainties due to parton showers and the hadronisation description are taken from a previous publication [8], after checking their validity for the 13 TeV result, and were derived as the differences between the acceptances calculated with Powheg-Box v1 but using different models for parton shower and hadronisation descriptions, namely the Herwig [81] or Pythia [63] programs. The acceptance factor used to extrapolate from fiducial to total cross sections, however, has a sizeable uncertainty which is treated as correlated in the ratio measurements for data at different \u221a s values.  Table 15. Acceptance factors A and combined total Z-boson cross sections times leptonic branching ratio within the invariant mass window 66 < m < 116 GeV for \u221a s = 13, 8, 7 TeV. The uncertainties in the cross sections are listed as statistical, systematic, beam-energy, and luminosity while those for the A factor include the total uncertainty.
