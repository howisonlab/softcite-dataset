An almost pure intense muon neutrino beam is produced at J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) in Tokai. The proton beam impinges on a graphite target to produce charged pions, which are focused by three magnetic horns [3]. The pions decay mainly into muonmuon-neutrino pairs during their passage through the 96meter decay volume. The neutrinos are measured by the near detectors (INGRID [4] and ND280 [5][6][7][8][9]) on the J-PARC site and the far detector (Super-Kamiokande [10]) in Kamioka, located 295 km away from J-PARC.",

            "text": "A precise neutrino oscillation measurement requires good knowledge of neutrino interaction cross-sections. The neutrino charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering is especially important for T2K because it is used as the signal mode for the T2K neutrino oscillation measurement. The \u03bd \u00b5 CCQE cross-section on carbon was measured by MiniBooNE [11], SciBooNE [12], NOMAD [13], MINER\u03bdA [14] and LSND [15]. The Llewellyn Smith formalism [16] using the relativistic Fermi gas model [17] is generally used to describe CCQE scattering with a neutron in the nucleus. However, this approach does not provide a good description of existing data. Several modifications to the model have been proposed to account for the discrepancies, but none of them has yet achieved general acceptance. One of the more promising approaches involves the introduction of neutrino interactions with two or more nucleons via so-called meson exchange current (MEC) into the neutrino interaction model [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. On the other hand, uncertainties in the nuclear model are also regarded as a possible cause of the discrepancy [25]. In order to resolve the puzzle, additional CCQE cross-section measurements are required.",

            "text": "Neutrino interactions with nuclear targets are simulated with the NEUT program library [26]. Both the primary neutrino interactions in nuclei and the secondary interactions of the hadrons in the nuclear medium are simulated in NEUT. NEUT uses the Llewellyn Smith formalism [16] with the relativistic Fermi gas model for quasi-elastic scattering, the Rein-Sehgal model [39,40] for resonant meson production and coherent \u03c0 production and GRV98 (Gl\u00fcck-Reya-Vogt-1998) [41] parton distributions with Bodek-Yang modifications [42,43] for deep inelastic scattering. For the measurement presented in this paper, the final state interactions of the nucleons in nuclei are important, because we use information about protons produced in the interaction. In NEUT, both elastic scattering and pion production are considered. The differential cross-sections were obtained from nucleon-nucleon scattering experiments [44]. For pion production, the isobaric nucleon model [45] is used. The \u03c0-less \u2206 decay, which is the interaction of the \u2206 within the target nucleus prior to decay into a pion and a nucleon, is also an important process because the resonant interaction event is often misidentified as the CCQE event due to this interaction. We use the data from Refs. [46,47] to determine the probability of the number of emitted nucleons and the kinematics of the twonucleon emission in the \u03c0-less \u2206 decay. For emission of three or more nucleons, the nucleons are isotropically emitted. The simulations in NEUT are described in more detail in Refs. [26,48]. Figure 4 shows the neutrinonucleus cross-sections per nucleon divided by the neutrino energy predicted by NEUT. Additionally, a CCQE cross-section prediction by a different neutrino interaction simulation package, GENIE [49], is used for comparison. GENIE also uses the Llewellyn Smith formalism with the relativistic Fermi gas model. However, the nominal value of the axial mass [50] differs from that in NEUT (1.21 GeV/c 2 for NEUT and 0.99 GeV/c 2 for GENIE). In addition, GENIE incorporates short range nucleon-nucleon correlations in the relativistic Fermi gas model and handles kinematics for off-shell scattering according to the model of Bodek and Ritchie [51] while NEUT uses the Smith-Moniz model [17].

The structure of the walls of the experimental hall is also modeled to simulate background events from neutrino interactions in the walls. The particles' motion and interactions with the materials are simulated, and the energy deposit of each particle inside the scintillator is stored. Simulations of hadronic interactions are performed with the QGSP BERT physics list [53]. The energy deposit is converted into a number of photons. Quenching effects of the scintillation are modeled based on Birks' law [54,55]. The effect of collection and attenuation of the light in the scintillator and the WLS fiber is modeled based on the results of electron beam irradiation tests. The non-linearity of the MPPC response is also taken into account, since the number of detectable photoelectrons is limited by the number of MPPC pixels. The number of photoelectrons is smeared according to statistical fluctuations and electrical noise. The dark count of the MPPCs is added with a probability calculated from the measured dark rate. Because the response of the ADCs on front-end electronics is not linear, its response is modeled based on the results of a charge injection test.",

About 7% of the selected events in the two-track sample have two matched tracks. Simulations indicate that the second matched track is usually a pion from a CC-nonQE interaction such as CC resonant pion production, CC coherent pion production etc. Thus, events with exactly one matched track are selected for the two-track sample ( Fig. 6). Hereafter, the matched track is referred to as the first track and the remaining track as the second track. Particle identification (PID) based on dE/dx information is applied on both the one-track sample and the two-track sample. The dE/dx for each scintillator plane is calculated from the light yield divided by the path length of the track in the scintillator where the light attenuation in the WLS fiber is corrected. The first step of the particle identification is to estimate a confidence level that a particle is a muon on a plane-by-plane basis. The confidence level at each plane is defined as the fraction of events in the expected dE/dx distribution of muons above the observed dE/dx value because muons have a lower dE/dx value than protons. The expected dE/dx distribution of muons is obtained from the beaminduced muon backgrounds which are mainly created by the neutrino interactions in the walls of the detector hall. The cumulative distribution function of the muon dE/dx distribution corresponds to the confidence level. The calculated confidence level at the i-th plane as a function of dE/dx is referred to as CL i .",

To quantify this, the coplanarity angle is defined as the angle between the two reconstructed three-dimensional tracks projected to the XY plane, where the XY plane is perpendicular to the neutrino beam axis (Fig. 10).

Thus, events with an opening angle above 60 \u2022 are selected (Fig. 12). The results of the event selection so far are summarized in Table II.  We aim to measure the CCQE cross-section in the low energy region (\u223c1 GeV) and the high energy region (\u223c2 GeV) separately. Thus, an energy classification is applied to the CCQE enhanced samples to select subsamples enriched in high-energy and low-energy events respectively. The classification criterion is shown in Fig. 13. Events with a muon candidate track which penetrates all the standard module iron layers are selected as the highenergy sample, while events with a muon candidate track which stops in the standard module are selected as the low-energy sample. Other events with a muon candidate track which escapes from the side of the standard module are not used in this analysis. Figures 14 and 15 show the neutrino energy spectra of the CCQE enhanced samples before and after applying the energy classification. Most of the CCQE events at neutrino energies below 1.0 GeV (above 1.5 GeV) are rejected by the high energy selection (the low energy selection). Figure 16 shows the selection efficiency of each sample as a function of the muon momentum and angle. Each sample covers the different muon kinematic region. ",

When a track from a neutrino event piles up with a track from another neutrino event in the same beam bunch, vertices may fail to be reconstructed. Because this results in the loss of events, this event-pileup effect needs to be corrected for. The event-pileup effect is proportional to the beam intensity. Hence, the correction factor is estimated as a linear function of the beam intensity, where the slope of the linear function is estimated from beam data as follows. First, the beam data is categorized into subsamples according to the beam intensity. In each subsample, all hits in INGRID from two beam bunches are summed together to make one new pseudo beam bunch. This procedure effectively doubles the beam intensity observed by INGRID. A slope is estimated from the number of selected events in an original beam bunch and a pseudo beam bunch for each subsample. The slopes estimated from all subsamples are consistent with each other, and the average value of this slope is used for the correction. This event pileup correction is applied bunch-by-bunch using the slope and POT per bunch which corresponds to the relevant beam intensity. The event pileup correction gives 0.3-0.7% difference in the number of selected event in each sample.",

The flux \u03c6 is integrated in each energy region, and \u03b5 is calculated for CCQE events in each energy region. CCQE events assigned to the wrong subsample, i.e. high-energy events in the low-energy subsample and vice versa, are regarded as background. The background events for this analysis consist of CC-nonQE events, NC events,\u03bd \u00b5 events, \u03bd e events, external background events created by neutrino interactions in the material surrounding the detector, and CCQE events assigned to the wrong energy sample. Furthermore, the CCQE cross-section in each energy region is estimated from the one-track sample, two-track sample, and combined sample, separately. The one-track sample (the two-track sample) has an enhanced content of low (high) energy protons from CCQE interactions as shown in Fig. 17. Therefore, we can cross-check the CCQE cross-section results from the different phase spaces.",

            "text": "Uncertainties on N BG , \u03c6, T , and \u03b5 are sources of systematic errors on the cross-section results. The sources of systematic error can be categorized into three groups: those from the neutrino flux prediction, the neutrino interaction model including intra-nuclear interactions, and the detector response. The neutrino flux uncertainty sources can be separated into two categories: hadron production uncertainties and T2K beamline uncertainties. The uncertainties on hadron production are mainly driven by the NA61/SHINE measurements [35,36] and the Eichten and Allaby data [37,38], and constitute the dominant component of the flux uncertainty. They include the uncertainties on the production cross-section, the secondary nucleon production, the pion production multiplicity, and the kaon production multiplicity. The second category of flux uncertainties is associated with inherent uncertainties and operational variations in the beamline conditions, including uncertainties in the proton beam position, the beam-axis direction, the absolute horn current, the horn angular alignment, the horn field asymmetry, the target alignment, and the proton beam intensity. The method of estimating these flux uncertainties is described in Ref. [30]. To evaluate the systematic error from the flux uncertainties, the flux is varied using a covariance matrix based on the flux uncertainty. This is repeated for many toy data sets, and the \u00b11\u03c3 of the change in the cross-section result is taken as the systematic error associated with the neutrino flux. The systematic error is 11-17%, which is the dominant error in this measurement.",

The spectral function parameter is introduced to take into account the difference between the relativistic Fermi gas nuclear model, which is the standard NEUT model, and the more sophisticated spectral function model [66], which is expected from electron scattering data [67,68] to be a better representation of the nuclear model. The implemented ad hoc parameters include cross-section normalizations. In addition, uncertainties on the final state interactions of the pions and nucleons with the nuclear medium are included. Table III shows the nominal values and uncertainties on these parameters. Systematic errors from the nuclear model (spectral function, Fermi momentum and binging energy) were found to be comparatively large because the CCQE interaction in the few GeV region is sensitive to the nuclear model. Further details about these uncertainties are described in Refs [48,69]. Systematic errors due to these parameters are estimated from variations of the cross-section results when these parameters are varied within their uncertainties. As a cross check, we also estimated the selection efficiencies using the GENIE neutrino interaction generator and confirmed that they were consistent with those using NEUT when the axial vector mass is set to the same value as GENIE, 0.99 GeV.",

The discrepancy between the hit detection efficiency measured with beam-induced muon backgrounds and that of the MC simulation, 0.21%, is assigned as the uncertainty in the hit detection efficiency.

The systematic errors from all event selections are evaluated by varying each selection threshold.

The difference in the predictions from NEUT and GENIE is attributable primarily to the difference in the nominal M QE A value. The results of the measurements are consistent within 2\u03c3 with both predictions; however, in the lowenergy region the cross-section results from the one-track and two-track samples differ by just under 2\u03c3, as shown in Table VII. The cross-section results are shown in Fig.  18 together with the predictions and the measurements of other experiments, and the reconstructed muon angle distribution of each CCQE candidate sample is shown in Fig. 19.

As discussed above, the spectral function model is more sophisticated and is expected to provide a better description of neutrino-nucleus interactions. When O. Benhar's spectral function [71] is used in the MC simulation for the efficiency correction instead of the relativistic Fermi gas model, the CCQE cross-section results are slightly changed, as shown in Table V (b), because of the differences in the kinematics of the final state particles which arise from the differences in the initial nucleon momentum distribution. The cross-section results derived using the spectral function model are shown in Fig. 20 together with the model predictions. The cross-section result in the low energy region from the one-track sample (the two-track sample) with the spectral function is 5% lower (10% higher) than that with the relativistic Fermi gas model. As a result, the difference in the cross-section results between one-track and two-track samples in the low energy region becomes smaller, as shown in Table VII in which correlations of the systematic errors between the cross-section results are correctly treated. This change mainly comes from the differences in the final state proton kinematics between the relativistic Fermi gas model and the spectral function, which cause event migrations between the one-track sample and the two-track sample. Therefore, this result may indicate that the spectral function is a better representation of the nuclear model than the relativistic Fermi gas model.",

Multi-nucleon interactions generally produce a lepton and two or more nucleons, but are misidentified as CCQE events when the additional nucleons are not reconstructed. This means that the CCQE cross-section measurement is expected to be sensitive to the existence of multi-nucleon interactions. Therefore, we also estimate the CCQE cross-sections assuming the existence of multi-nucleon interactions. There are many multi-nucleon interaction models [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]; we used the model proposed by J. Nieves [20,21]. When the multi-nucleon interaction model was introduced into the neutrino interaction model, the CCQE model including the value of M QE A and the relativistic Fermi gas model were not changed in order to isolate the effect of the multi-nucleon interaction. In this CCQE cross-section analysis, the CCQE signal is defined as the conventional two-body interaction with a single nucleon. Therefore, the multi-nucleon interaction events are defined to be background events and are subtracted from the selected events as with CC-nonQE events, NC events, etc. The CCQE cross-section results assuming the existence of multi-nucleon interactions are summarized in Table V (c) and shown in Fig. 21 together with the predictions. Although the measured CCQE cross-sections assuming the existence of the multi-nucleon interaction are 6-13% smaller, they are still compatible with the predictions.",

We have selected one-track and two-track samples of \u03bd \u00b5 CCQE scattering in the Proton Module. From the number of selected events, the CCQE cross-sections on car-   bon at mean neutrino energies of 1.94 GeV and 0.93 GeV have been measured. The cross-section analysis was performed using three different neutrino interaction models: relativistic Fermi gas models with and without multinucleon interactions, and a spectral function model without multi-nucleon interactions. Although these results are compatible with the model predictions, we found that the CCQE cross-section results are dependent on the nuclear model and the existence of multi-nucleon interactions at the 10% level. There is some indication, based on consistency between the one-track and two-track samples, that the event kinematics are better described by the spectral function model. The data related to this measurement can be found electronically in [72].",
