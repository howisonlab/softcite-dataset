            "text": "A search for dark matter particles is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum, at least one energetic jet, and no leptons, in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb \u22121 . The search includes events with jets from the hadronic decays of a W or Z boson. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted background contributions from standard model processes. The results are presented in terms of simplified models in which dark matter particles are produced through interactions involving a vector, axial-vector, scalar, or pseudoscalar mediator. Vector and axial-vector mediator particles with masses up to 1.95 TeV, and scalar and pseudoscalar mediator particles with masses up to 100 and 430 GeV respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of the invisible decays of the Higgs boson, yielding an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.44 (0.56) on the corresponding branching fraction. The results of this search provide the strongest constraints on the dark matter pair production cross section through vector and axial-vector mediators at a particle collider. When compared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and 550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. The search yields stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 200 GeV, assuming a pseudoscalar mediator, when compared to the indirect detection results from Fermi-LAT.",

            "text": "Astrophysical observations have provided compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) in the universe [1][2][3]. However, there is no compelling experimental evidence for non-gravitational interactions between the DM and standard model (SM) particles. Most current models of DM assume that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [2]. If such particles exist, direct pair production of WIMPs may occur in TeVscale collisions at the CERN LHC [4]. If DM particles are produced at the LHC, they would not generate directly observable signals in the detector. However, if they recoil against a jet radiated from the initial state, they may produce an apparent, large transverse momentum imbalance in the event. This is termed the 'monojet' final state [5,6]. The DM particles may also be produced in association with an electroweak boson, resulting in the 'mono-V' signature, where V represents the W or Z boson [7][8][9]. Observation of these final states could be interpreted as evidence for DM particles. Additionally, the Higgs boson [10][11][12] could be a mediator between DM and SM particles [13][14][15][16][17]. The monojet and mono-V signatures can be used to set a bound on the invisible branching fraction of the Higgs boson.",

Results from earlier searches [18][19][20] have typically been interpreted using effective field theories that model contact interactions between the DM and SM particles. Recent search results [21][22][23] have been interpreted in terms of simplified DM models [24][25][26][27][28][29][30]. The invisible branching fraction of the Higgs boson, B(H \u2192 inv), has been constrained by several searches at the LHC [20,[31][32][33][34], with the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations setting upper limits of 0.25 and 0.24, at 95% confidence level (CL), respectively, through direct searches [35,36]. Precise measurements of the Higgs boson couplings from a combination of 7 and 8 TeV data sets, collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, provide indirect constraints on additional contributions to the Higgs boson width from non-SM decay processes. The resulting indirect upper limit on the Higgs boson branching fraction to non-SM decays is 0.34, at 95% CL [37].",

In the case of the mono-V signature, a hadronic decay of a W or Z boson reconstructed as a single large-radius jet is considered. The results of the search are interpreted using simplified DM models in which the interaction between the DM and SM particles is mediated by a spin-1 particle such as a Z boson, as shown in figure 1, or a spin-0 particle (S), as shown in figure 2. The results are also interpreted in terms of B(H \u2192 inv). The Feynman diagrams for the production of the SM Higgs boson and its decay to invisible particles resulting in the monojet and mono-V final states are similar to those shown for a spin-0 mediator in figure 2.",

            "text": "The CMS detector is a multi-purpose apparatus designed to study a wide range of physics processes in proton-proton and heavy ion collisions. Its central feature is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter that produces a magnetic field of 3.8 T parallel to the beam direction. A silicon pixel and strip tracker is contained inside the solenoid and measures the momentum of charged particles up to a pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| = 2.5. The tracker is surrounded by a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a sampling hadron calorimeter (HCAL) made of brass and scintillator, which provide coverage up to |\u03b7| = 3. The steel and quartz-fiber\u010cerenkov hadron forward calorimeter extends the coverage to |\u03b7| = 5. The muon system consists of gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid, and covers |\u03b7| < 2.4. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [38]. The particle-flow (PF) event algorithm [39,40] reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energies.",

Jets are reconstructed by clustering PF candidates using the anti-k T algorithm [41]. Jets clustered with distance parameters of 0.4 and 0.8 are referred to as AK4 and AK8 jets, respectively. The primary vertex with the largest sum of p 2 T of the associated tracks is chosen as the vertex corresponding to the hard interaction in an event. All charged PF candidates originating from any other vertex are ignored during the jet reconstruction. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum, over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup). Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and \u03b3+jet events [42].

Jets used in the H miss T,trig computation are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 5.0. The energy fraction attributed to neutral hadrons in these jets is required to be less than 0.9. This requirement removes jets reconstructed from detector noise. The values of E miss T,trig and H miss T,trig are calculated without including muon candidates, allowing the same triggers to be used for selecting events in the muon control samples used for background estimation. The trigger efficiency is measured to be about 95% for events passing the analysis selection with E miss T \u2248 200 GeV. The triggers become fully efficient for events with E miss T > 350 GeV. Events considered in this search are required to have E miss T > 200 GeV, which ensures that the trigger efficiency is higher than 95%. The leading AK4 jet in the event is required to have p T > 100 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Unlike earlier searches performed by the CMS Collaboration in this final state [19,21], there is no requirement on the number of reconstructed jets in the event. The leading AK4 jet must have at least 10% of its energy associated with charged hadrons, and less than 80% of its energy coming from neutral hadrons. These re- quirements, along with quality filters applied to tracks, muon candidates, and other objects, reduce the background due to large misreconstructed E miss T [43].",

The Z(\u03bd\u03bd)+jets process constitutes the largest background and is irreducible. The W( \u03bd)+jets background is suppressed by vetoing events that contain at least one isolated electron or muon with p T > 10 GeV, or a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton with p T > 18 GeV. Electron candidates must have |\u03b7| < 2.5, and are required to satisfy identification criteria based on the shower shape of the energy deposit in the ECAL, the matching of a track to the ECAL energy cluster, and the consistency of the electron track with the primary vertex [58]. Muon candidates must have |\u03b7| < 2.4, and are required to be identified as muons by the PF algorithm. The isolation sum of the transverse momenta of particles in a cone of radius 0.4 (0.3) around the muon (electron), corrected for the contribution of pileup, is required to be less than 25% (14%) of the muon (electron) transverse momentum. The \u03c4 lepton identification criteria [59] require a jet with an identified subset of particles whose invariant mass is consistent with that of a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton, and for which the pileup-corrected isolation sum of the p T of particle candidates within a cone of radius 0.3 around the jet axis is less than 5 GeV. Events are vetoed if they contain an isolated photon with p T > 15 GeV that satisfies identification criteria based on its ECAL shower shape [60]. This reduces electroweak backgrounds with a photon radiated from the initial state to about 1% of the total background. The top quark background is suppressed by vetoing events in which a b-jet with p T > 15 GeV is identified using the combined secondary vertex algorithm with the medium working point [61,62], which has a 60% ef-JHEP07(2017)014 ficiency for tagging jets originating from b quarks, and a 1% probability of misidentifying a light-flavor jet as a b-jet. Lastly, in order to suppress the QCD multijet background in which large E miss T arises from a severe mismeasurement of the jet momenta, the minimum azimuthal angle between p miss T and the directions of each of the four highest p T AK4 jets with p T > 30 GeV is required to be greater than 0.5 radians. The QCD multijet background is reduced to about 1% of the total background after this requirement.",

If a V boson has p T > 250 GeV, its hadronic decay is more likely to be reconstructed as a single AK8 jet than as two AK4 jets. An event is categorized as a mono-V event if it has E miss T > 250 GeV, and the leading AK8 jet in the event has p T > 250 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and also passes requirements used to identify jets arising from hadronic decays of Lorentzboosted V bosons. Jets arising from hadronic decays of a V boson are identified using the N -subjettiness variable \u03c4 N [63]. Low values of \u03c4 N are indicative of an N -prong decay. In particular, the ratio \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 discriminates the two-prong decays of a V boson from QCD jets, and the leading AK8 jet is required to have \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 < 0.6. Additionally, the invariant mass of the jet is required to be between 65 and 105 GeV in order to be consistent with the mass of the W or Z boson. The jet mass is computed after pruning [64], which involves reclustering of the jet constituents using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [65,66] and removing the soft constituents in every recombination step, thereby improving the jet mass resolution. The requirements on the \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 ratio and the jet mass result in a 70% efficiency for tagging jets originating from V bosons, and a 5% probability of misidentifying a QCD jet as a V jet. If an event fails any of these mono-V selection requirements, it is assigned to the monojet category. The selection requirements for the mono-V and monojet categories are listed in table 2.",

The invariant mass of the dielectron system is required to be between 60 and 120 GeV, as in the case of the dimuon events. A single-electron trigger with a p T threshold of 27 GeV is used to select these events. If the Z boson has p T > 600 GeV, the two electrons produced in its decay typically have a small angular separation, and are likely to be included in each other's isolation cones. This effect results in some inefficiency for the single-electron trigger, which imposes isolation requirements on electron candidates. In order to overcome this inefficiency, events are also accepted if they pass a single-electron trigger that has a p T threshold of 105 GeV and no isolation requirements on the electron candidate. Furthermore, in order to improve the efficiency of the electron triggers in the early part of the data taking, additional events passing JHEP07(2017)014 a trigger with a threshold of 800 GeV on the total sum of the p T of jets (H T ) reconstructed at the trigger level are also included. The same set of triggers is also used for selecting events in the single-electron control sample. At least one of the two electrons in the dielectron control sample is required to have p T > 40 GeV, and is required to pass tight identification requirements on the shower shape of its ECAL energy deposit, the matching of a track to the ECAL energy cluster, and the consistency of the electron track with the primary vertex. The isolation sum of the p T of particles in a cone of radius 0.3 around this electron, corrected for the contribution of pileup, is required to be less than 3.5% of the electron p T for electrons within the ECAL barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.48), and less than 6.5% of the electron p T for electrons within the ECAL endcaps (1.48 < |\u03b7| < 2.50). The single-electron events are required to contain exactly one tightly identified and isolated electron with p T > 40 GeV. No additional muons or electrons with p T > 10 GeV are allowed. The QCD background in the singleelectron control sample is suppressed by requiring E miss T > 50 GeV, and m T < 160 GeV. The \u03b3+jets control sample is constructed using events with one high-p T photon that are selected using single-photon triggers with p T thresholds of 165 or 175 GeV. As in the case of the electron control samples, additional events passing the H T trigger with a threshold of 800 GeV are also included. The photon p T is required to be larger than 175 GeV, which ensures that the trigger efficiency is greater than 98%.

The transfer factors for the dilepton control samples relate the yields of Z(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) and Z(e + e \u2212 ) events to the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) background in the signal region by taking into account the difference in the branching fractions of Z(\u03bd\u03bd) and Z( + \u2212 ) decays and the effect of lepton acceptance and selection efficiencies.

            "text": "event selection criteria. An estimate of the multijet background in the signal region is obtained by applying E miss T -dependent transfer factors, derived from simulated QCD multijet events, to this control sample. The overall uncertainty in the multijet background estimate, based on the variations of the jet response and the statistical uncertainties in the transfer factors, ranges from 50 to 150%, depending on the event category and the E miss T region. The remaining background sources include top quark and diboson processes, which are estimated directly from simulation. The p T distribution of the top quark in simulation is corrected to match the observed p T distribution in data [71]. A systematic uncertainty of 10% is assigned to the prediction of the top quark background cross section [72]. An additional 10% uncertainty is assigned to the top quark background normalization to take account of the modeling of the top quark p T distribution in simulation. The overall normalization of the diboson background has an uncertainty of 20% [73,74]. These uncertainties in the top quark and diboson backgrounds are correlated across the signal and control samples. Several experimental sources of uncertainty are associated with the backgrounds estimated from simulation. An uncertainty of 6.2% in the integrated luminosity measurement [75] is propagated to the background yields. The uncertainty in the efficiency of the b-jet veto is estimated to be 6% for the top quark background and 2% for the diboson background. The uncertainty in the efficiency of the V tagging requirements is estimated to be 13% in the mono-V category. The uncertainty in the modeling of E miss T in simulation [76] is dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty, and is estimated to be 5%. 6 Results and interpretation Figure 6 shows the E miss T distributions in the monojet and mono-V signal regions. The background prediction is obtained from a combined fit in all the control samples, excluding the signal region. Data are found to be in agreement with the SM prediction. Tables 3  and 4 show the estimated yields of background processes in the monojet and mono-V signal regions, respectively, along with the observed event yields in the two signal regions. The correlations between the uncertainties across all the E miss T bins in the two signal regions are reported in appendix A. These results can be used with the simplified likelihood approach detailed in ref. [77] for reinterpretations in terms of models not studied in this paper. Figure 7 shows the E miss T distributions where the background estimates have been computed after including events from the signal region in the fit, but assuming the absence of any signal. The comparison of this fit with an alternative fit assuming the presence of signal is used to set limits on the DM signal cross section.",

The approach outlined in refs. [30,88,89] is used to translate the exclusion contours into the m DM vs. \u03c3 SI/SD plane where \u03c3 SI/SD are the spin-independent/spin-dependent DM-nucleon scattering cross sections. These limits are shown in figure 11 for the vector and axial-vector mediators, and in figure 12 (left) for the scalar mediator. For the scalar mediator model, only the contributions from heavy quarks (charm, bottom, and top) are taken into account while evaluating the limit on the DM-nucleon cross section, as done in ref. [21]. When compared to the results from direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and 550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. In the case of the pseudoscalar mediator, the 95% CL upper limits are compared in figure 12 (right) with the indirect detection results in terms of the velocity-averaged DM annihilation cross section from the Fermi-LAT Collaboration [90], and provide stronger constraints for DM masses less than 200 GeV. Figure 9. Exclusion limits at 95% CL on signal strength the \u00b5 = \u03c3/\u03c3 th in the m med -m DM plane assuming scalar (left) and pseudoscalar (right) mediators. The limits are shown for m med between 50 and 500 GeV, and m DM between 0 and 300 GeV. While the excluded area is expected to extend below the minimum value of m med , the axis does not extend below this value as the signal simulation was not performed in this region. The red line shows the contour for the observed exclusion. The solid red contours around the observed limit represent one standard deviation theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross section. The dashed blue contour in the case of the scalar mediator shows the \u22121\u03c3 deviation due to the combination of the statistical and experimental systematic uncertainties. Constraints from the Planck satellite experiment [83] are shown with the dark green contours and associated hatching. The hatched area indicates the region where the DM density exceeds the observed value.",

The predictions for the Higgs boson production cross section and the corresponding theoretical uncertainties are taken from the recommendations of the LHC Higgs cross section working group [101]. If the production cross section of the Higgs boson is assumed to be the same as \u03c3 SM , this limit can be used to constrain the invisible branching fraction of the Higgs boson. The observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the invisible branching fraction of the Higgs boson, \u03c3B(H \u2192 inv)/\u03c3 SM , is found to be 0.44 (0.56). The limits are summarized in figure 13. Table 5 shows the individual limits for the monojet and mono-V categories. While these limits on B(H \u2192 inv) are not as strong as the combined ones from ref. [36], they are obtained from an independent data sample and therefore will contribute to future combinations.

The observed exclusion in this search (red line) is compared to the results from the CDMSLite [91], LUX [92], PandaX-II [93], and CRESST-II [94] experiments. For the pseudoscalar mediator (right), limits at 95% CL are compared to the velocity-averaged DM annihilation cross section upper limits from Fermi-LAT [90]. There are no comparable limits from direct detection experiments as the scattering cross section between DM particles and SM quarks is suppressed at nonrelativistic velocities for a pseudoscalar mediator [99,100]. served with respect to the standard model backgrounds. Limits are computed on the DM production cross section using simplified models in which DM production is mediated by spin-1 or spin-0 particles. Vector and axial-vector mediators with masses up to 1.95 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming a coupling strength of 0.25 between the mediators and the standard model fermions, and a coupling strength of 1.0 between the mediators and the DM particles. The results of this search provide the strongest constraints on DM pair production through vector and axial-vector mediators at a particle collider. Scalar and pseudoscalar mediators with masses up to 100 and 430 GeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming the coupling of the spin-0 mediators with DM particles to be 1.0 and the coupling of the spin-0 mediators with standard model fermions to be the same as the standard model Yukawa interactions. When compared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and 550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. The search yields stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 200 GeV, assuming a pseudoscalar mediator, when compared to the indirect detection results from Fermi-LAT.
