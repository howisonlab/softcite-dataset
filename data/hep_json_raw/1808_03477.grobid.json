            "text": "The study of strange-hadron decays has fuelled discoveries in particle physics for the past seventy years. For instance, experimental anomalies in the strange sector motivated the prediction of the charm quark via the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, while the discovery of CP violation prompted the postulation of the beauty and top quarks within the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) paradigm; all now key ingredients of the Standard Model (SM). Presently, strangeness decays are valuable probes in the search for dynamics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), being particularly relevant in searches for sources of quark flavour violation beyond the CKM matrix. Since s \u2192 d transitions have the strongest suppression factor, they can typically probe energy scales higher than those accessible in JHEP05(2019)048 charm or beauty-hadron decays for couplings of comparable size [1]. Nevertheless, flavour physics experiments have greatly enhanced such knowledge from charm and beauty decays in recent years, while few measurements of strange-hadron decays have been updated or performed for the first time.",

            "text": "Several dedicated experiments exist for specific measurements, however few experiments possess the potential to construct a comprehensive program on the study of strange hadrons. In this work, it is argued that the LHCb experiment has the capacity, both in terms of detector performance and statistics, to produce leading measurements exploiting almost all strange-hadron species, particularly in the search for their rare decays. An overview of the current results and prospects of strangeness decays at LHCb is given, demonstrating LHCb's unique reach as a strangeness factory and motivating further research in this area. In fact, the LHCb collaboration has already published the world's most precise measurements in K 0 S \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [2,3] and \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [4], while projecting world-leading results for K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [5] and K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 [6].

(2.1) holds also for K \u00b1 , the relative efficiency of K \u00b1 decays with respect to K 0 S decays is then at the level of 1%. On the other hand, the use of downstream tracks can allow for an increased lifetime acceptance. The transverse momenta of the products of strangeness decays, significantly softer than for b-hadron decays, are also detrimental to their detection at LHCb. While b-hadron decay products generally have a transverse momenta of around 1-2 GeV/c, for s-hadron decays the range is more in the region of 100-200 MeV/c. The acceptances for several benchmark channels, as well as invariant-mass resolutions, are estimated in the following applying a simplified simulation of the LHCb upgrade tracking, based on the detector descriptions found in refs. [17,23,24]. The following selection criteria are applied to all decay channels: the daughter particles are required to have a track impact parameter to primary vertex of greater than 400 microns, a momentum greater than 3000 MeV/c with transverse momentum greater than 80 MeV/c, while the reconstructed hadron is required to have a decay time greater than 8.9 ps and a flight distance in the plane transverse to the beam greater than 3 mm. These requirements are based on the Run 2 trigger for detached soft dimuons [25] and on the lower decay time requirement from ref. [2]. These requirements are expected to be realistic also for future data-acquisition periods in LHCb. Acceptances are then normalised to that of fully reconstructed K 0 S \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , which is found to be around 1%. The results of this simplified simulation are given in table 1, where the efficiency is shown using long tracks only ( L ) and using downstream tracks only ( D ), along with the invariant-mass resolution for each reconstruction method. The efficiency scale factors for charged hadrons with at least 300 MeV/c and electrons with over 200 MeV/c transverse momenta are also normalised to fully reconstructed K 0 S \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and indicated in parentheses. As neutral particles like the photon, neutrino and \u03c0 0 are not reconstructed in this study, the invariant mass of particular strange hadrons is calculated with additional kinematic constraints.",

            "text": "The current trigger of LHCb has three stages, a hardware stage (L0) and two software stages (HLT1 and HLT2). The L0 is practically unchangeable and implies an efficiency loss of roughly 80% of reconstructible strange-hadron decays involving muons [25]. For non muonic final states it implies a loss of about 90% to 99%, due to the much larger transverse energy trigger thresholds for hadrons and electrons [26], depending on whether also events triggered by the underlying event (and not by the considered signal) are accepted or not [27]. During Run 1, the total trigger efficiency for strangeness decays was 1-2% or lower, depending on the final state. The main reason for those low efficiencies is the soft transverse momentum spectrum of strange-hadron decay products. During Run 2, dedicated software triggers for strange-hadron decays into dimuons have been implemented with an overall improvement of about one order of magnitude in the total trigger efficiency achieved with respect to Run 1 [25]. In the Upgrade of the LHCb experiment, the trigger is expected to be entirely software based with L0 removed, hence O(1) efficiencies are attainable. 1 It has been shown in simulation that for dimuon final states, the output rate can be kept under control for transverse momentum thresholds as low as 80 MeV/c without any significant signal loss [5]. Although the dimuon final state is the cleanest signature from an experimental perspective, trigger algorithms for other final states are possible and are currently under investigation. As an example, a software trigger for dielectrons from strange decays was already implemented during Run 2 [6] and will serve as a basis for the Upgrade.",

In this paradigm, it becomes possible to measure a S from the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 yield alone, which is tested as the final case. The reach of LHCb in each of these scenarios is summarised in table 4 for different effective yields. In the case that b S is measured from the data, its uncertainties are expected to be 0.87 (0.35) for the Phase-I (Phase-II) data samples. The results show that with the effective events from Phase-I data, the constraint coming from NA48 on the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 branching fraction will play a role in reducing the uncertainty on a S , while with Phase-II data, the uncertainty will be entirely dominated by the LHCb K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 measurement. The results also indicate the vast improvement in a S that becomes possible at the expense of model independence and demonstrate that the q 2 distribution has very little impact on the overall uncertainty on a S when b S is fixed.

Due to bremsstrahlung, electrons are generally more difficult to reconstruct than other particles, such as pions or muons. This is especially the case for low momentum electrons, such as those expected in K 0 S decays. Given the branching fraction of K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 , a significant yield per fb \u22121 is expected to be produced within the LHCb acceptance, thus this decay could be used both for CP -violation studies [38] and to search for potential resonant structure in the e + e \u2212 invariant-mass spectrum.

The presence of electron bremsstrahlung combined with the low transverse momentum of the final state particles, makes the invariant-mass resolution of this final state significantly worse when compared to K 0 S \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , for instance. New reconstruction strategies could enhance the sensitivity of LHCb to K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 and other similar final states, such as those mentioned above. Given that the position of the K 0 S production and decay vertices can be determined, the invariant-mass resolution of the K 0 S could be calculated ignoring the absolute momentum of one of the four final state particles through relativistic kinematic constraints. This is advantageous as the invariant-mass resolution becomes less dependent on bremsstrahlung, given that the direction of electrons in the VELO is barely influenced by such effects. In addition, this technique could allow a more efficient reconstruction of these electrons, using tracks not required to have a segment after the magnet. Taking into account that the VELO pattern recognition efficiency is at the level of \u223c 70% [40], even for tracks with p \u223c O(1 MeV/c), improvements in the reconstruction efficiency up to a factor of 10 could be theoretically possible.",

The resolution is studied here using simulated K 0 S \u2192 \u03b3\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, corresponding to the most restrictive case of a massless X 0 . This decay is predicted in the SM to occur with a branching fraction of (1.45 \u00b1 0.27) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [41]. Background from generated K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is also considered with the aforementioned simplified tracking emulation. From figure 6, the distinction between signal and background is visibly worse for K 0 S \u2192 \u03b3\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 than it is for K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 .

These decays are dominated by long-distance contributions involving one photon exchange i.e. K \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The branching fraction has been derived within the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7 P T ) in terms of a vector-interaction form factor, which describes the single-photon exchange and characterises the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum [37,43,44]. The differential decay rate can be written as a kinematic term depending on masses and 4-momenta, multiplied by |W (z)| 2 , where W is the form factor and z = (m \u00b5\u00b5 /M K ) 2 . The form factor is given by W (z) \u221d W pol (z)W \u03c0\u03c0 (z), where the second term represents the tiny contribution from the two-pion-loop intermediate state and the first term is phenomenologically described by a polynomial. As the form factor is required to vanish at lowest order in the low-energy chiral expansion, the polynomial term takes the form W pol (z) = (a + + b + z), where a + and b + are free parameters of the model to be determined by experiment. In a similar fashion to b \u2192 s transitions, s \u2192 d processes can be described with an effective Lagrangian depending on Wilson coefficients, generating only the non-zero Wilson coefficients C 7A and C 7V for the semileptonic operators. Such coefficients can be split into SM and BSM contributions. In particular, a + can be written as a function of the Wilson coefficient C 7A [45], leading to potential constraints on BSM. A further comparison of the electron and muon channels would provide an additional test of Lepton Flavour Universality and further constrain BSM dynamics.",

Assuming O(1) trigger efficiencies, a yield of O(10 4 ) fully reconstructed and selected signal events is expected per year of upgraded-LHCb data taking, even considering only long-track candidates. This suggests K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays would provide an early opportunity for a measurement to demonstrate the potential of the upgraded detector for these channels. Similar arguments apply to the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + e + e \u2212 mode, whose somewhat lower reconstruction efficiency due to the presence of electrons is negated by its larger branching fraction. Rigorous control over the systematic uncertainties will be paramount in order to improve the current world-average precision of 3% on the electron mode. If successful, the full spectrum of both channels will afford a highly precise test of Lepton Flavour Universality.",

More quantitative estimates require the introduction of a flavour model [45,[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64]. As discussed in ref. [65], such arguments can be extended to the K \u2192 (\u03c0)\u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 case, with fairly general assumptions on the different flavour couplings involved. Expected rates can be as large as 10 \u221210 -10 \u221213 for the K L \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 mode and a factor of \u223c 100 smaller for K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 . Taking into account the suppression mechanisms at play, such 'large' rates are a non-trivial finding. Their relatively wide range is due to the inherent model dependence especially in JHEP05(2019)048 the choice of the leptonic coupling and the overall scale of the new interaction, typically between 5 and 15 TeV [65]. Since limits on the branching fractions for the K \u2192 \u03c0e\u00b5 modes were pushed down to the level of 10 \u221211 \u2212 10 \u221212 in the 1990s, there has been no significant further progress on the experimental side, with the current limits at 90% CL,",

A measurement of the branching fraction is reported along with a dimuon invariant-mass distribution consistent with SM predictions, challenging the so-called HyperCP-anomaly [70]. This measurement was based on Run 1 data, where no trigger path existed specifically for this channel. As discussed in ref. [25], Run 2 will have a dedicated trigger both at the HLT1 and HLT2 levels, where about an order of magnitude increase in the trigger efficiency is anticipated. With a signal yield in excess of 150 events, Run 2 data will allow a measurement of the differential decay rate and possibly other observables with recent predictions such as the forward-backward asymmetry [71]. Applying similar reasoning on the trigger efficiency as with other decays in this document, on the order of a thousand signal decays could be measured per year of data taking with an upgraded LHCb detector, opening the possibility for precision measurements of direct CP violation. Assuming similar reconstruction and selection efficiencies, a search for the lepton and baryon number violating \u03a3 + \u2192p\u00b5 + \u00b5 + decay could also be performed, reaching an expected branching fraction sensitivity on the order of 10 \u22129 .",

For this reason while our simplified model could predict their reconstruction efficiency, the sensitivity for \u03a3 0 decays would be dominated by primary interaction background, which would require a full simulation to be understood. We therefore do not provide estimates on these sensitivities. We limit ourselves to suggest that LHCb could attempt a first search for the \u03a3 0 \u2192 \u039be + e \u2212 decay, for which no experimental measurement is currently available, despite the fact that several authors proposed this decay to study parity violation in strangeness-conserving weak currents [75][76][77]. In lieu of an experimental measurement the PDG reports a theoretical calculation driven by internal photon conversions for an expected branching fraction of about 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [78], easily reachable by LHCb if background can be controlled.",

The branching fractions of such hyperon decays, which are copiously produced at the LHC, show uncertainties at the 20% \u2212 100% level leaving vast room for progress. modes have already been measured very precisely. Kinematic constraints such as those applied in the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 analysis can be used to reconstruct the strange-baryon peak. Since the expected yields for strange semileptonic decays are large, the main challenge is not the trigger efficiency, but is instead the discrimination against peaking backgrounds like \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 or \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 .

Clearly, the signal and peaking background provide contrasting signatures. It has to be noted, however, that neither final state radiation in the \u039b decay nor the decay in flight of the pion are included in the simulation, both of which are effects that can partially dilute the discriminating power of the missing transverse momentum. A similar study is performed for \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 \u2212\u03bd \u00b5 , which also demonstrates the separation between signal and the corresponding peaking-background distribution from \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 decays, as depicted in figure 10.",

            "text": "Competition from other experiments on strange-hadron decays will be scarce in the coming years. We briefly review it in the following. The NA48 experiment has contributed significantly to the physics of strange-hadron decays, but has already analysed their full dataset on rare K 0 S and hyperon decays (e.g. refs [36,38,91,92]) and we are not aware of any plan to exploit it further. The NA62 experiment will give fundamental results on charged kaons, however it will not have a neutral beam at its disposal before 2026. In particular, NA62 may reach the 10 \u221212 ballpark in LFV kaon decays [93] with the data collected so far. The KLOE2 experiment will most probably be able to contribute on semileptonic measurements, in addition to its core CP -violation program, and possibly measure the K + mass, but will not have enough statistics for rare decays. The CLAS experiment could possibly contribute again to searches on rare hyperon decays, but will not be competitive with LHCb below the 10 \u22127 level in branching fraction. Similarly it is not expected to  Figure 10. The left plot shows the reconstructed invariant mass for \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u00b5 \u2212\u03bd \u00b5 candidates. Signal events are given by a solid blue line, while the \u039e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 background is displayed in filled red. The right figure shows a scatter plot of the reconstructed mass vs. missing momentum in the plane transverse to the \u039e \u2212 flight direction for signal (blue squares) and \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 background (red stars). Final state radiation in the \u039e \u2212 and \u039b decay vertices is not included in the simulation. contribute on K 0 S decays. Finally, flavour factories such as BESIII and BelleII can possibly contribute to the physics of rare strange-hadron decays. The BESIII collaboration has for example published a search for \u03b7 \u2192 K\u03c0 decays [94], reaching a branching fraction limit of order 10 \u22124 . We are not aware of any published physics result from the Belle collaboration on rare strange hadron decays and this topic is not mentioned in BelleII physics book [95]. In addition, there are new proposed facilities such as TauFV [96] which may be able to reach O (10 19 ) kaons in the decay volume, with a detector layout comparable to that of LHCb, for which however we are not aware of more in-depth sensitivity studies on the decay modes discussed in this paper. However, we would welcome an increase in the interest for strange physics and would consider competition from these collaborations to be a very healthy development indeed.",

For the first time, this paper reports estimates of detection efficiencies for several K 0 S , K \u00b1 and hyperon decay channels and evaluates the invariant-mass resolution that could be achieved with the full and downstream tracking systems, while demonstrating the capacity of LHCb to resolve signal from potential peaking-background distributions. The results show that several promising new measurements are feasible in various K 0 S , K \u00b1 and hyperon decays with diverse final states.",
